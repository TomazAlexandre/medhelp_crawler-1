            "answer": "The ANA can be nonspecifically elevated. However, if you have other symptoms or history of miscarriges, you must have this addressed before proceeding with IVF.I also think you should try to eat healthier. You do not have diabetes but if your 109 was a fasting blood sugar then you have an abnormal fasting glucose and should avoid eating too much refined carbohydrates like white bread, white flour, and rice. It is better to eat less carbohydrates and eat complex, high fiber grains like whole wheat, brown rice. Of course, eating lots of vegetables and exercising will also help too.",
