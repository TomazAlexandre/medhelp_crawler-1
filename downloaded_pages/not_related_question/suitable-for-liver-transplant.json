    "question": "Dear Doctor,My dad, 68-years old, was admitted for vomiting blood since early morning. He was bleeding from the food pipe which was closed with endoscopy.My parents and brother are in India, and I am in Europe. Because of this, I cannot talk to my dad's doctor myself. My brother is doing all he can. My dad's doctor (Dr. Naresh Bhat) seems to be well-known, and well-regarded.My dad has been feeling very cold (for the last few months!) even on warm days, and has had swelling in his legs due to fluids accumulation. For the last couple of weeks, he has been complaining of indigestion and a feeling of fulness on eating even a small amount of food. He has a history of diabetes, approx. 15 years. (I don't remember exactly.)Right now, he is still at the hospital, and on medication to reduce his ascites. The doctor has informed us that a liver transplant is not advisable, given my dad's age. My dad has A+ blood, and my brother and I have O+. However, my brother has diabetes and a history of a heart-condition, and is now on blood-thinners. I am 35 years old, and have Hep B, which is now under control with Entecavir. My dad does not have a history of either heart-disease or Hep B (or C). I don't know if he has enough HBsAb to be considered immune.I'd still want to know if my dad can use a part of my liver. I weigh about 63kg and my dad, about 75kg. If I am not a suitable donor, do you have any idea how easy it is to get a donor for a cadaveric transplant? How advisable is it in my dad's case? I'd be grateful for your comments on the prognonsis too!I'll paste the detailed lab reports in the next message.",
