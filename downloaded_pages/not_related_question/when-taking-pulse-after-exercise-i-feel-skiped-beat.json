    "question": "HelloI am an active 35 yr old female in good shape.\u00a0\u00a0I exercise 4 - 5 times per week with regular cardio and weights.\u00a0\u00a0I use albuterol prior to exercise for exercise induced asthma.\u00a0\u00a0After I run sometimes I take my pulse and I feel a skipped beat.\u00a0\u00a0There will be regular beats, then a long one.\u00a0\u00a0I do not feel it in my chest, just on my wrist where I take my pulse.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to happen every 10 - 20 beats for an hour or so after I exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Is this dangerous?\u00a0\u00a0I have been doing research online and it appears skipped beats in the recovery phase is more likely to cause sudden death.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have heart disease and my maternal grandfather had heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0Is the danger there when you have a heart deffect or just in general when having the skipped beats in recovery.\u00a0\u00a0I also have a lot of acid reflux and take medication with that. When running, it can stir up some acid.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure if that also has something to do with it.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate your help.",
