            "answer": "In my experience (as a 40+ year type 1), endos with an understanding of type 1 adults (those of us with complications, for example) are rare. I have found 2, one who was part of a large endo group and chose to focus on type 1, and my current endo who IS a type 1. The understanding and advice I recieve is unquestionably much better from such a doctor, even compared to those who have had many more years experience. It is worth the effort to search for one.",

    "question": "Do any of you have endos or other diabetes specialists who specialize in primarily in treating Type 1 patients?\u00a0\u00a0My husband is in his fifties and has a slight gut.\u00a0\u00a0As a result, despite the fact that he has had Type 1 for 30 years and it is always marked that way in his chart, we usually discover that his endo, GP, or whatever has been assuming he is Type II.\u00a0\u00a0Also, because the majority of their patients are Type II (obvious given the numbers out there), they seem to be more knowledgeable about Type II and have a much less clear understanding of the unique difficulties of living with Type I and achieving decent control.Example, we recently got a CGMS (Continuous Glucose Monitor).\u00a0\u00a0We were informed by their nurse educator that Pediatric Endos are eagerly adopting this technology to use with their patients (no doubt primarily Type 1), whereas the Endos who treat adults say \"It's too complicated\", \"Patients won't understand the technology\", \"Patients will never use it\".\u00a0\u00a0As a result, most don't even mention the possiblity to their patients.\u00a0\u00a0These are of course the exact same things they said when home glucose monitors came out and look how wrong they are.\u00a0\u00a0I think the difference between the Peds and Adult Endos is that the Adult Endos see primarily Type IIs and their statements may be valid for them (although I expect a lot of Type IIs who are using insulin and are highly motivated would gladly use a CGMS.Anyway, again, do any of you have endos who specialize in Type 1 and do you feel it makes a difference?\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas on\u00a0\u00a0sources of info for endos of this nature in the Iowa area?",
