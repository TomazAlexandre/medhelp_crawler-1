            "answer": "Hello,Thanks for posting your query.I can understand your concern. Pain or burning sensation at tip of penis is usually due to prostate causes which you have been diagnosed with.It is true that the first time you have herpes, it can cause the nerves to your bladder to become inflamed. If this happens, you will not be able to urinate and bladder does not empty properly. However this is a temporary problems and does not persist for years.Regarding any relation between HSV1 and prostate, then various studies have not reported any relation between diseases of the prostate like prostatitis and prostate cancer and HSV 1 infection.You seem to be having symptoms due to prostate causes and should take the prescribed medicines regularly as advised by your doctor. Other than that get sexually transmitted diseases like Chlamydia and Gonorrhea also ruled out which can cause such symptoms. Also get your blood sugar levels checked to rule out any diabetes mellitus.Hope that this information helps and hope that you will get better soon.Wishing you good health.",

    "question": "I had an encounter with a CSW in July 2012. It was protected vaginal and unprotected oral in beginning. All STD tests were negative except HSV1 came positive through Igg. A small portion of foreskin where urine trickle/remain burns /tingles continiously for over more than a year. I tested for uroflowmetry. Result is 23 ml/sec max. Ultrasound of bladder indicated 126ml of post voidal residue urine after emptying. Full bladder was more than 1000ml. Doctors said that since the bladder was overloaded hence the post voidal residue was more. Now I am taking Toviaz and Harnal D ie for over active bladder and prostate I guess. But I dont get at night to urinate. I try not to drink water after 6.30pm. Could HSV1 visus affected the prostate? Could HSV1 visus affected the bladder nerves? Please let me know why this burning sensation? Is affecting the quality of my life and I have not had sex with my wife after this incident. Its very frustating.",
