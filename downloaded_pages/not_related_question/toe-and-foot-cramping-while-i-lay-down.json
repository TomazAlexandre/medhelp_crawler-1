            "answer": "I am not a doctor, but am a well-read type 1 diabetic, so please check out any information I give you with your own physician. I did some research on foot cramps and can tell you what I have found out.\u00a0\u00a0I do not know your age, but cramps in the feet while sleeping at night is apparently fairly common as people grow older. It is believed that this is sometimes caused by poor circulation in the feet, and is more common in diabetics than in other people. If you are younger than the middle years, then perhaps it could be a result of damage to blood vessels because of diabetes not properly controlled.Normally, neuropathy is noticed with tingling or burning sensations in feet, and this is what most diabetics look out for and fear. However, diabetes can be very damaging to small blood vessels when glucose is high for long periods of time, and this could affect the circulation in your lower legs and feet. I would strongly advise you to make an appointment with your endocrinologist to get checked for other possible causes, and also perhaps to be checked for the beginnings of neuropathy, for if blood vessels are indeed being damaged and this is causing the cramps, then nerves are probably being damaged too. Nerve daamge can also cause cramping. And of course you would want to know at the very beginning of anything like this starting to happen so you can tighten up your glucose control to protect yourself.There are other possible causes of cramps at night, but of course the possibility of complications from poor control of diabetes would be the most important one to check out and hopefully either rule out completely or treat before serious damage is done. Your body may be warning you, and a wise person would heed the warnings and get to the doctor for some tests. You will be glad you did. I hope it turns out to be nothing more serious than messed up electrolytes in your case and that you can rest easier after a check-up.",

I will look down and see my big toe and the one next to it spreading apart.. it hurts really bad for probably about 20 to 30 seconds.. it does it multiple times if I dont get up from my sleep.. lately its been the whole foot doing it.. when its happening I feel my foot and the muscles feel like they are folding and bending on top of eachother.. its really painful.. and again that lasts like 20 to 30 seconds.. what is going on here? it makes it for I cant sleep sometimes.. is there something going majorly wrong with my body? I am also diabetic and I hate to admit it but.. I dont have my blood sugar under control.. I sometimes dont even take my insulin.. could the cramps be happening cause of that?",
