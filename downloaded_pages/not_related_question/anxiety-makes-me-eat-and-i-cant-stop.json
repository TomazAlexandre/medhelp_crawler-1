            "answer": "Hi Kittylove,I used to have exactly the same little demon.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing that has helped me (just sharing my personal experience) was developing a sense of a higher consciousness.\u00a0\u00a0I read many books about this and the ones that have made the most impact have definitely been anything by Eckhart Tolle.\u00a0\u00a0\"The Power Of Now\" and \"A New Earth\" are especially enlightening.\u00a0\u00a0I know it sounds esoteric but this issue is a very profoundly spiritual one and it will keep creeping up no matter how much psychotherapy you get (again, from experience).\u00a0\u00a0I am far from reaching complete consciousness, but I have come a very long way.\u00a0\u00a0Living consciously and in a state of alertness and with presence really does help all kinds of psychic pathologies - kinda like waking up from a really bad dream and being really relieved it was just a dream....Love & LightCeli",
