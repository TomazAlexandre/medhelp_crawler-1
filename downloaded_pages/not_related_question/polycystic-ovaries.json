The small cysts are where your eggs are and so we do not want to get rid of the eggs but we do want the syndrome to go away and your ovaries to look and become more normal. You need to have a complete assessment of your hormones including FSH, LH, Estradiol, Prolactin, TSH, DHEAS, Testostoerone, 17OH-progesterone, fasting insulin, a 2 hour GTT with a 75 gram glucose challenge, lipid panel, kidney functions and liver functions.\u00a0\u00a0Women with PCOS have an increased risk for diabetes or glucose intolerance or insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0If you are obese with increased body mass index and if you lose weight, exercise and eat a good glycemic index diet then you can improve your PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0If you have diabetes or glucose intolerance then Metformin can help you as well to control your blood sugars. Therefore there is a lot you can you with diet, exercise, weight loss to improve your condition. If you are not obese and do not have any of the glucose intolerance issues then it is more difficult because weight loss will obviously not help. You should have the androgens (male type hormones) checked because you may need to control or lower these hormones by taking certain medications such as a birth control pill like Yasmin which contains DSP with can lower the male hormone for you.Alternative approaches like acupuncture and chinese herbal medicine from an acupunctuist who specializes in women's health can also be an option for youlI suggest seeing a reputable specialist called a Reproductive Endocrinologist to help you get started.",
