            "answer": "Dear Lookinsosparkly,Reduced appetite, bloating, frequent burping with a normal CT indicates a reduced compliance of the upper part of the stomach called the fundus. Reduced compliance may be secondary to gastritis, \u201cwith or without ulcer\u201d.Food sticking in esophagus and heartburn indicate a 'reflux' disease. Lower esophageal sphincter incontinence or hiatus hernia are one of the several factors associated with reflux.CT scan is a poor modality to look at either of these conditions. Endoscopy is the investigation of choice.Vagal nerve damage is usually secondary to long standing diabetes or nerve diseases and is rare as compared to the above discussed problems. Hence I do not think vagal nerve injuries to be the cause here.Consult your Gastroenterologist and get an endoscopy with testing for helicobacter pylori. This test will make things clearer.Hope that this information helps and hope that you will get better soon.Thank you for using MedHelp's \"Ask an Expert\" Service, where we feature some of world's renowned medical experts in their fields.

    "question": "Dear Drs.I had undiagonized abdominal pain about 2 months ago and was waiting for endoscope. The pain lasted a couple of weeks and was then gone.\u00a0\u00a0I had ct scan and sonogram with no diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Last week I had\u00a0\u00a0strange sensation in my upper stomach like a muscle 'popping'.\u00a0\u00a0Now I have no sensation of hunger - no spasms or rumbling. I can only eat a small amount of food at a time and it seems to stick in my esophagus and cause heartburn. I can drink water. I am burping a lot if i eat or drink.I have had ok bowel movements up to yesterday. I think my stomach is not communicating with me any more. I am reading online and see this could be vagus nerve damage.\u00a0\u00a0What could cause this?\u00a0\u00a0Can it be treated?\u00a0\u00a0I have an appt with the GI tomorrow with these new symptoms. (Could it be lower esophogus sphincter issue? I have not had this sensation before of not feeling hungry)Thank you if you can give me some help.",
