    "question": "Let me start out. I was diabetic, had gastric bypass 3 years ago and was taken off metformin as my a1c was like 4.8. I should preface that I always have an issue with high morning numbers. My last a1c was 5.8, so still good but my bg on the test was 200. Now this week I has a wellness screening at work and my fasting bg was 330. The last week or so I have been feeling blah and lightheaded. I called my doctor who wanted me to go to the emergency room but I declined as I was feeling fine. I have been watching what I have been eating the last couple of days and have added metformin at night and the morning 500mg. The doctor at work thinks I may be dehydrated. I am not thirsty. But when I drank about 50 oz of water it did go down 150 points. The thing is I feel fine, except in the morning. My last reading after dinner of a hamburger and a couple of fries was 430. My doctor wants me to check my bg for a week then call with the results. I don\u2019t know what my bg was before this week as I hadn\u2019t checked it. Needless to say I\u2019m worried.",
