    "question": "I am on 500 mg of metformin once a day. My doctor said my a1c said above 15. I already have nerve damage and other symptoms. I want to know if this an appropriate treatment, and when i can expect my glucose to return to normal. Also they said my vitamin D levels were extremely low, is that caused by the diabetes? Also, i'm bewildered by this. But they said after my high a1c test, i got blood drawn 10 minuters later, and they said the results of that blood test is that my glucose levels were low 10 minutes later. Can anyone explain this?",
