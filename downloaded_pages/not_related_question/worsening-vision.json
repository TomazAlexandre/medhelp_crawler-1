Sort of like strobe lights. It was difficult to focus. Any ideas?",

I also have noticed that when I cover my left eye colors appear faded. I am seeing an ophthalmologist in a couple of weeks. I have noticed that my right eye is slightly misaligned...could this be causing the problems with my vision?",
