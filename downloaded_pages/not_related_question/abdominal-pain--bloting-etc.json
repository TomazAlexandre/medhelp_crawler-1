    "question": "I almost always feel bloated and full, especially after eating. I have abdominal pain after eating too . I'm also almost always tired and feel nauseous alot with the pain or bloating or fullness. I have had a few tests and they don't think it's my liver or my gallbladder or stones. I've had an ultrasound, blood work and an Upper GI and they stil haven't found anything...Can anyone give me any ideas what it could be?",
