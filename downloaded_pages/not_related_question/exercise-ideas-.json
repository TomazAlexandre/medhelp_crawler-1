    "question": "Before my pregnancy, I was really active. I enjoyed long hikes, backpacking, going to the gym, and doing hot yoga. I even started a weightlifting program with a personal trainer. However, once I got pregnant, I became terrified of miscarrying. I stopped everything and am now having a difficult time figuring out what I can do that is low impact.What are you all doing for exercise these days? I could use some ideas.Thanks!",
