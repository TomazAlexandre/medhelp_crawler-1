            "answer": "Hi,Some of your symptoms overlap with many different possible disorders, so it is difficult to tell based on those.A slightly elevated IGF-1 may not be a sign of a true disease but should be repeated and if still high then speak to your doctor about possible Acromegaly(this is the endocrine disease most often associated with elevated IGF-1 levels). But do know that a slight elevation in IGF-1 can happen with other causes.Cushings can cause some of your symptoms but is diagnosed by a HIGH urine cortisol, not low. Diabetes is certainly something that should be screened for also.I hope this is of some help. You definitely should be under the care of a specialist to help determine your diagnosis and get you feeling better soon.Take care.",

    "question": "Sorry, I know this is a Diabetes forum but can't find any where else to ask these questions. I am a 29 yr old female with osteoporosis (yes I know I am young for this). I was sent to endocrine to try to see why. Everything has been normal except my Somatomedin C (IGF-1) is elevated at 358 (up 29 pts) and my cortisol level (24 hr urine) was low. I am told they are looking for Cushings but I am not sure if these results support that dx? Here is a list of my symptoms...- Joint Pain (Osteoarthritis in numerous joints)- Headaches (chronic- daily)- Fatigue- Acne (excessivly oily but also dry skin)- Weight gain- High Blood Pressure (mostly only elevated diastolic - around 90)- Cold Intolerance- always cold (thyroid levels are normal)- Heat Intolerance- Heart Palpitations- Depression- Raynauds (hands excessively cold-turn white/purple)- Non existant period- unless induced by hormone treatments- Eye issues (they question early glaucoma due to\u00a0\u00a0large sized hole in my optic nerve. For now they are just monitoring it and my visual fields, my pressures are normal.What would elevated IGF-1 & low cortisol levels mean, could this contribute to my osteoporosis? I know that the IGF-1 has something to do with insulin and how it is processed with your hormones but I am confused...is this diabetes related? Any help you can contribute is greatly appreciated!Thank you for your help,Jennifer",
