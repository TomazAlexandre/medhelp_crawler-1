            "answer": "Thank you for your input in regards to IHSS/valve dysfunction and Central Sleep apnea.It seems more likely perhaps that the Central Sleep apnea may be causing the cardiac changes we have seen (bradycardia, etc).\u00a0\u00a0We have been told that these effects can be bi-directional.Fasting blood sugars have always been normal.\u00a0\u00a0GTT testing has shown mild elevations (up to 180 post prandial), but home testing has yielded no indication of blood sugar etiology for the extreme fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0Other neuropathy etiologies have been ruled out and we suspect that perhaps the neuropathy may be related to hypoxemic episodes.Given the hypoxic stress of severe Cental Sleep apnea that has not responded to the most advanced CPAP device, and the history of elevated tri-glycerides and cholesterol (now well controlled with medication and diet), would you say a cardiac cath. would be advisable to determine blockage risk, or is this too invasive without any current symptoms of angina or chest pain?",

    "question": "Can early IHSS or mild valve insufficiency be a possible cause for severe Central Sleep apnea?\u00a0\u00a0If so, what is the best means of diagnosis and intervention?\u00a0\u00a0I have had a pacemaker placed for bradycardia, and have been using an Adapto-Servo ventilator (4 sleep studies this past year), but have had minimal relief of fatigue and progressive general neuropathy.My ejection fraction is 54%.\u00a0\u00a0E/A ration is 0.9.\u00a0\u00a0Trace mitral and pulmonic and mild tricuspid insufficiency.\u00a0\u00a0The pulmonic and tricuspid changes are new.\u00a0\u00a0I have an occasional murmur, only once very marked one day after exercise.I do 4 miles 4 times a week on the treadmill (in an hour).\u00a0\u00a0I have been doing this for 3 years without any increase in exercise tolerance or improvement of endurance.\u00a0\u00a0My Dad had IHSS.",
