            "answer": "Hello Elaine,Thanks for your reply.If I understand you correctly the human body can react different from a new IVF/ICSI treatment to a Frozen Embryo Transfer?The pain I does experience does not feel normal. It feels like my body has dismissed the embryo the implanting.Here in the Netherlands I am prescribed 6 progesterone bolls to use during the embryo implantation.Since my last treatment, almost 2 years ago I have been diagnosed with diabetes. And I am also now\u00a0\u00a0taking medication for my thyroid.When I was a younger (up to 4 years ago) I never use to menstrual often even sometimes up to a year. I also have a history of chlamydia. Where it was discovered years after, l had a liquid residue in my uterusLucky, I menstrual monthly now, with an average of every 31 days.I sometimes wonder if all of these problems make it impossible for me to ever get pregnant.",
