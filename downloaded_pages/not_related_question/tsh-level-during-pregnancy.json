            "answer": "1 - would first correct TSH to target of 0.3-2.0 with planned conception.2 - there is an increased risk of miscarriage with this condition, but proper levothyroxine (eltroxin) management reduces the risk to the usual 15% risk in normal pregnancy.3 - This is likely Hashimoto's, which can be genetic -- but the immediate risk is fetal development problems if the thyroid is not fully corrected prior to conception.",
