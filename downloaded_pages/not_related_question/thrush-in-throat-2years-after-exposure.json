            "answer": "Hello,You do not have HIV and you do need to get tested again.\u00a0\u00a0Your sexual encounter was safe and your negative test results are fully conclusive.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to that your symtoms do not correlate with acute HIV sero-conversion either.\u00a0\u00a0There are hundreds of causes for oral thrush, much more common than HIV:\u00a0\u00a0smoking, alcohol, antibiotics, stress, diabetes, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I doubt very much that the kiss was the cause of this thrush after two years.If you continue with these symptoms, my advice to you is to consult your doctor to find the possible causes and get treated accordingly, but I can assure you that it has absolutely nothing to do with HIV.Best wishes,Dr Jose",
