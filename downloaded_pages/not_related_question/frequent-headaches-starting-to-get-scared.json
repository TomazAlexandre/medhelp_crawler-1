    "question": "Thank you for taking time to read this. As a 21 year old student in the medical field, I learn about different diseases everyday. About 2 months ago I was shopping at the local grocery store and suddenly out of nowhere everything felt so far away. It was like an out of body experience. The voices around me seemed miles away, I felt short of breath, and had a feeling that felt like I was going to faint. Although, I have never fainted in my life this is the only way I could assimulate this feeling. I was rushed to the ER. The ER doctor didn't do anything except check my blood pressure, and oxygen levels, all which came out normal. He said I had suffered an anxiety attack. Never in my life before this had I felt this feeling.I consulted with my regular family physician and he said the same thing. I then went on to ask him about the headaches I had been having. I explained that I have a headache at least every other day, it hurts in one spot only-on the top of my frontal lobe. I have been going to the doctor since I was 13 for these headaches. First it was migraines, then stress, now anxiety. I'm beginning to get scared and am afraid that it's something bad. What are the symptoms I should look out for as far as aneurysms or brain tumors??I went to the doctor again this past week. He's my regular physician and he checked my eyes for a very long time with a light. He said he was looking at the veins that connect to my brain to located any pressure on them. He did strength tests and then assured me I was ok. Should I be stressing an MRI scan or CT scan. I'm in college and do not have health insurance and so I understand that one of those scans can be very expensive.Do you have any answers?I would really appreciate the advice.thanks.",
