            "answer": "I was told your diabetes is in remission if you have normal readings consistently for s period of time. I forget what time that is. However given that you were diagnosed you have to eat in mind that you still ate do that you don't return to high numbers. I was diagnosed 2 years ago, ate right & exercised then fell off the cliff numbers are worse now. I'm trying to control it by lifestyle changes. My number after dinner was 130 but this morning my fasting BG was 206. Walked briskly for an hr for 3.25 miles. BG 97. My brother said exercise is the key & I've noticed it immediately. Even 30 minutes of a 20 minute mile helps",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with diabetes about 9 months ago. I have a family history and a rare orphan disease that seems to have ignited the Diabetes. I was prescribed Metformin but I wasn't happy about adding more medication to my life. I've been on IV treatments & meds for my other disease. I cut out most carbs & added excercise and lowered my A1C to normal range. Does this mean I'm not diabetic anymore? In spite of my lowered A1C, if I eat any high carb food, I'm up all night peeing & feel like I'm dying of thirst....",
