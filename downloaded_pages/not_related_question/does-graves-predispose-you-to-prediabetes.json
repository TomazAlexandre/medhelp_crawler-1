            "answer": "Here are the facts:\u00a0\u00a0the incidence of thyroid diseases in the general population is about 6%.\u00a0\u00a0However, the incidence of thyroid diseases in diabetics is about 10.8% suggesting a possible link between the two disorders.It has been thought for some time that thyroid dysfunction may affect diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Thyroid dysfunction (hyperthyroidism) is linked to worsening glycemic control and increased insulin resistence, both strong indicators in pre-diabetes and obvious problems in diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the answer appears to be yes in the case of hyperthyroidism.Where this becomes difficult is that Graves can cause hyper-thyroidism, but in some cases it shuts down thyroid gland activity, producing hypothyroidism.Prof Garth Nicolson",
