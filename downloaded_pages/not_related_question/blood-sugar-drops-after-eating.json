            "answer": "Hi,You may be having an overly brisk insulin response to eating heavy carbohydrate loads(like the bread) and a form of what is sometimes called \"reactive hypoglycemia.\" If this is the case, the best treatment is to have several(usually 406) small mixed meals during the day instead of 2-3 big ones that tend to be heavy in carbohydrates. The small meals should have a portion of protein, carbohydrate and fats. Try to avoid simple sugars like sweets, sodas etc, as well as meals that are predominantly carbohydrates. This should help. If you continue having low blood sugars or ever get to a point of passing out please seek medical help as soon as possible. Do not drive when you feel tired and dizzy.Take care",

    "question": "Hi, I was told last year that my blood sugar was low so i was given a meter. I notice that when I wake up in the morning its about 90 but when I eat toast I get very hungry and shaky around noon. When I take my blood it 50 to 60. Is the bread causing my blood sugar to drop? It causes me to be very tired and dizzy",
