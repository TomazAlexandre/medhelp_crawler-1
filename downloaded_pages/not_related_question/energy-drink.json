            "answer": "first off WOW ... second I don't know where to get info. I have had Diabetes for 23 years and have seen it all been there and done that, this coach is uneducated when it come to your daughter care, My baseball coach was the same way, and I had to be brave and speak up and tell him about my Diabetes, it took a while for him to understand when I had to take a snack break and that I was not trying to skip out on some activities, some of the guy I played with know more about it then he did.sounds like he needs to learn to read what in the drinks he handing out that there might be that one person that cant have it and prepare for that person so she can have some thing like it. I do have to say your Daughter should have known that drinking that was not a good thing. learn to read the Nutrition Facts. I have to read up on a lot of new stuff to keep up with it all. Wish you the best!!",

            "answer": "Hi-I think the comment was a good one, your daughter is going to have to be brave and know what will not make her feel good. I would suggest you go to a website that lists the\u00a0\u00a0symptoms of hypoglycemia and what things can and cannot be eaten or drunk.\u00a0\u00a0I found http://www.hypoglycemia.org/hypo.asp\u00a0\u00a0to be helpful.Also, be firm with this coach, just because he doesn't feel it was a big deal doesn't mean that it isn't.\u00a0\u00a0Or maybe he was embarrassed and reacted this way, either way be polite and firm and don't back down and I am sure the message will be clear.",

    "question": "My daughter's soccer coach allowed an experiment to be done at practice where she was given a Monster energy drink.\u00a0\u00a0He was aware that she had hypoglycemia when she was given the drink, and the caffeine and sugar content caused her to get sick.\u00a0\u00a0I questioned why he would give her something he knew was harmful to her, and his response was very nonchalant, like it was not a big deal.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know where I can find information to give to him about how harmful this was to her?",
