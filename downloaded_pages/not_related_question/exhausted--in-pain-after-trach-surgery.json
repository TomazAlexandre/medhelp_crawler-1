            "answer": "Yours is a complicated respiratory problem with elements of asthma and (?obstructive?) sleep apnea (OSA) .\u00a0\u00a0Your description of the sleep apnea as \u201csevere and crippling\u201d along with memory and cognitive function problems suggests that the treatment of the OSA is not optimum and, in any event, the placement of a tracheostomy would not suffice as the sole treatment for OSA.There is truth to your understanding that a tracheostomy may improve blood gas exchange and reduce the work of breathing but your inability to \u201cexhale for more than a second\u201d could be a combination of asthma and a less than optimum sized tracheostomy.That you remain \u201cso tired\u201d suggests that your current treatment may be sub-optimum.\u00a0\u00a0A respiratory illness as complex as yours would ordinarily best be managed by a lung specialist (pulmonologist) with a special interest and expertise in the diagnosis and management of sleep disorders, but also knowledgeable about the management of asthma.You should discuss this with your current doctors as your current situation is worrisome.Good luck",
