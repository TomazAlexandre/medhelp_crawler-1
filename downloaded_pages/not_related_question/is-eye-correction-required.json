            "answer": "There is absolutely no need to have surgery.If you wanted surgery there are two ways:ICL as you mentioned it. I would not recommend it. It increases the risk of early cataract.CLE = Clear Lens Extraction = early cataract surgery without cataract. This is an option.But all surgery increases the risk of retinal detachment. Being highly myopic your risk is higher than average. So surgery should only be done when there is no alternative.But you can do well with your contacts and glasses.I am doing well with my glasses and my refraction is very similar to yours.You need to have your eyes checked every year and whenever vision changes especially the back of the eye.And you can live a healthy life to prevent being bothered by other eye diseases such as early cataract, diabetes, high blood pressure and trauma.",

    "question": "Hi,I have high myopia. I have had myopia from a very young age of 4. My right eye power is around -16 and left eye is around -10.I was tested by a lasik doctor and he said lasik OD is not possible on my right eye due to high myopia and insufficient corneal thickness. However he said he would recommend bilateral STAAR ICL's with LRI's OU or possible LASIK only OS. He said left eye lasik is possible though.I have been living on, wearing contact lenses for the past 9 years. I have had no issues. I wear contact lenses during the mornings and evening i switch back to glasses. So completely at ease at the moment.Since lasik is not possible, and being a person who does not want to take unnecessary risks by opening up the eye for the ICL (would like to have my natural lens intact), is there an option, i can just continue on , with my present life of contact lenses ? Is correction really necessary for the long run ? (considering i am only 25)Is there any issue i will have, if i dont correct my eye now and just live life ?(My priority is not throwing away spectacles/contact lenses and surgeries, but only long term healthy vision)",
