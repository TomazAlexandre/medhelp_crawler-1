Hormones begin kicking in to prepare the body for the coming day, the liver will dump its store of glucose to get things started. This is called Dawn Phenomenon. Check your glucose level in the middle of the night (around 3 AM). If your blood sugar is high, you are probably experiencing Dawn Phenomenon. One thing to try is not to snack 2-3 hours before bedtime. Carbs will raise glucose levels during the night.",

            "answer": "DP can show up in non-diabetics as well; in non-diabetics it can show up as measurably increasedinsulin secretion or high fasting glucose levels around dawn.. First thing to do is either double check the glucose meter you are using against a simultaneous reading in a laboratory, or use another meter that has been validated in such a way to assure that the readings you are getting are accurate.Depending on your height, weight, eating and exercise habits, the cheapest way to handle this may be to determine whether diet and exercise measures make this go away.If you are worried about your health, please schedule an exam with your doctor then explain the symptoms as you have described them here.",
