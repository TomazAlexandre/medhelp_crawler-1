            "answer": "I would have a urinalysis performed on her urine.\u00a0\u00a0If she has a urinary tract infection I would also perform a culture and sensitivity on the urine to see which antibiotic would be the most effective.\u00a0\u00a0This problem could also be a sign of early kidney disease, which can be determined by checking the microalbumin content of the urine (usually a part of a complete urinalysis).\u00a0\u00a0If microalbumin is found in the urine than blood work is warrented to determine the extent of the kidney disease.\u00a0\u00a0A CBC/Chemistry/T4 should be performed.\u00a0\u00a0This will determine if there is\u00a0\u00a0diabetes, anemia, kidney disease, liver disease, and hyperthyroid disease,etc.\u00a0\u00a0Incidentally, a 16 year old cat is a senior citizen and\u00a0\u00a0should be checked for all of the above anyhow.Don't\u00a0\u00a0assume that the inappropriate urination is just due to behavioral causes until all the physical causes are eliminated.\u00a0\u00a0If all tests are normal than it is probably behavioral, and if so, you must try and discover if there is any change in the enviromment that has effected her adversely such as a new pet or a new human in the enviroment, work men in the enviroment, changing the furniture around, etc,etc,\u00a0\u00a0 Whether something has changed in the enviroment or not, purchase some Feliway to use to try to\u00a0\u00a0make her comfortable again.\u00a0\u00a0Feliway is a natural feline pheramone in a spray or air-freshener form.\u00a0\u00a0Use as directed.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes this product is enough to get a cat back on tract.If Feliway does not work there are several different medications that can be tried, such as anti-anxiety medications, anti-depressents and others.\u00a0\u00a0It may take one or two course of medications to find the one that is effective for her.\u00a0\u00a0Just try to be patient because in 99% of the cases of inappropriate urination there is an effective treatment.",

            "answer": "Are the messes feces as well as urine?\u00a0\u00a0My elderly dog lost bowel control with the onset of canine arthritis and sometimes does not know when a movement is on the way to such an extent that she messes her bed.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if the same goes for cats but you might want to ask your vet.\u00a0\u00a0An x-ray was the only way I found out; maybe you could just watch for apparent weakness.\u00a0\u00a0If there is arthritis, it might be painful for the cat to climb into the box.\u00a0\u00a0I live by \"Nature's Miracle\" these days.",
