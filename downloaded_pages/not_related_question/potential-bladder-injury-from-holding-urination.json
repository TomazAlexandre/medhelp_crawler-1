            "answer": "It is unlikely that holding your bladder for 90 minutes caused permanent damage.\u00a0\u00a0However, any type of pain or urinary discomfort warrants further evaluation.Infections, prostate disorders, and systemic diseases such as diabetes can all cause an urge to urinate.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest a urinalysis as well as a thorough rectal exam to evaluate the prostate.\u00a0\u00a0You can also consider a bladder scan to ensure that the bladder is not full after you urinate.If these evaluations are not revealing, you may want to consider a urology referral for further evaluation of the sensations after you urinate.\u00a0\u00a0A cystoscopy can be considered to evaluate for anatomical abnormalities (i.e. urethral stricture or polyps).Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Thanks,Kevin, M.D.",

    "question": "I am a 27 year old male with no health problems. Three days ago I was in an extended business meeting and decided to hold urination for approximately 90 minutes. The discomfort/pain was only quite pronounced in the final 20 minutes. Since urinating for the first time after this episode, I have had some problems with my bladder. I feel a constant urge to urinate. My bladder constantly feels full and is the source of discomfort. I do NOT have a burning sensation when I urinate; however, I do feel a slight tickle at the tip of my penis.\u00a0\u00a0Could I have done some damage to my bladder? What could be wrong?",
