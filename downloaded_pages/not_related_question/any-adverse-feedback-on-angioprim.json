            "answer": "Perhaps you will be able to point me to proper scientific research on this topic please. All I can find when I search are comments from the FDA regarding children and adults who have died from chelation therapy. I have obviously read statements from Doctors who administer the drugs, but of course they would say of the thousands of people administered, they have seen no deaths etc. This is obviously not scientific evidence. Is there any evidence apart from the drug companies blowing their own trumpet?",

            "answer": "I had an angiogram done (on private insurance) to establish the cause of my chest pain, I was informed that I have a narrowing artery and a stent was suggested...however private insurance would not cover for this at the time of investigation (angiogram), so I was patched up and put on the NHS waiting list for a stent and was given loads of medication by the doctor...to cut a long story short, I stumbled on the Angioprim website and decided to give it a try (after all they promise to refund your money if it does not work and the feedback from users was very positive), I completed the 12 bottle course and felt no different so I requested my money back which was done instantly.Two months later I had an appointment to attend St Thomas's in London for a further investigation and possible stent insertion, I was taken into theatre and returned back to the ward and was informed by the procedure performing cardiologist that they could not find any reason to fit a stent and that my arteries were clear - he had no answer for this... I was asked to immediately stop all the prescribed medication and was sent home...was this a result of taking Angioprim? maybe but I don't know for sure, I am glad to say that I am back to normal health.",

    "question": "Recently I have come across very positive feedback on \"Angioprim\" which, it appears that, dissolves the plaque in the arteries. As per the information I read from posts on a website, this drug can open even 100% blocked arteries and is very effective. I was wondering why we are struggling to reduce cholostrol when this drug can remove plaque even within a week.There must be some adverse feedback, why many people do not use this drug?\u00a0\u00a0So far I have come across only positive feedback.Can anyone throw some light?? Thanks in advance.",
