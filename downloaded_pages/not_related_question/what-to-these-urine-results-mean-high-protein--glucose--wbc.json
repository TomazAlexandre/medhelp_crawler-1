    "question": "Hi! Mid 20s petite female. I've been really tired lately and was told My urine results were abnormal: high protein (.3 g/l) high glucose (2.8 mmol/l) and high leukocyte esterase (75WBC/uL) . Ketone, blood, nitrate were negative and ph, Gravity, and alb / creat ratio is normal. All the blood tests show high fasting cholesterol but are otherwise all normal ( normal blood glucose, immunology, immunofixation, chemistry, hematology) I don't have any of the symptoms of a UTI, I almost never have to pee. What's wrong with me?",
