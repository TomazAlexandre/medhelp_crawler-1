            "answer": "i agree with the concept that your father is likely aspirating and that would explain the chronic cough, and damage to lungs. there is no single procedure will remove the barium, and it will show up in x-rays for long period. i think looking for the aspiration episodes is warranted more attention to know if thiis is due to structural causes or neurological causes.",

    "question": "My father, age 82, had an upper GI performed about a month ago.\u00a0\u00a0During the procedure the tech. kept telling him to hurry up and my father ended up aspirating barium.\u00a0\u00a0Since that time he has had increased difficulty with breathing and is weak.\u00a0\u00a0He has been hospitalized once and received IV antibiotics since this happened for a 'possible' pneumonia/infiltrate.\u00a0\u00a0He has had both a chest x-ray and CT scan.\u00a0\u00a0He was discharged home one week ago and has an appointment with a pulmologist this coming Monday, February 23.\u00a0\u00a0I realize the barium is not going away.\u00a0\u00a0I will be going with my father to his appointment and want to know ahead of time what some of the options are for possibly removing the barium?\u00a0\u00a0I hope they can do something, because he is so weak and out of breath that he is miserable.\u00a0\u00a0He has Type II diabetes and is slightly anemic.\u00a0\u00a0The reason he was having the upper GI performed was because he had been coughing and 'choking' as if something were in his throat, although these episodes were occasional. His results from the upper GI were negative.Any information about how to possibly remove the barium from his lungs (both lower lobes) would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to have an idea of what might be said at his appointment on Monday.Thanks,Sue",
