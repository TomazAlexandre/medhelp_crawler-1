Some women find that they are glucose intolerant. If you have a lot of sugar in your diet or drink a lot of alcohol, these can help feed yeast.\u00a0\u00a0Yeast loves sugar and alcohol.Also,\u00a0\u00a0bcp can contribute to chronic yeast.\u00a0\u00a0Yeast also love the extra\u00a0\u00a0estrogen in the pills.\u00a0\u00a0Tight pants or pantyhose, nylon underwear can also contribute to yeast infections.\u00a0\u00a0Thongs are bad. They are a highway to infection.You might not have yeast.\u00a0\u00a0You may be having a reaction to your soap, laundry detergent, the dye in your underwear or what ever type of pad or tampon you use.\u00a0\u00a0Always pads are KNOWN to cause reactions.\u00a0\u00a0There are all natural cotton alternatives.\u00a0\u00a0Do not use baby powder or any other 'feminine' product on yourself. They are all evil!Do not clean yourself with soap. Use water and your fingers. Excessive cleaning can irritate your tissues.You shouldn't just keep treating for yeast. It may not be yeast. Have your doc send a sample out to be cultured. If you keep treating with over the counter meds, you may very well end up with a severe reaction from it.\u00a0\u00a0Those chemicals are very harsh.\u00a0\u00a0If you do use them, don't use the 1 or 3 day treatments.\u00a0\u00a0The lower dose over a longer period of time is much easier on you.Boric acid suppositories should help as a pretty friendly treatment.\u00a0\u00a0If your doc says there is nothing that they can do since they have tried everything, find another doctor.I hope some of this helps.",

If you have either of these you will most likely suffer from yeast infections if the virus flares up.\u00a0\u00a0But there are many causes of yeast infections, it can even be an allergy.Also try cleaning out your colon and intestinal track with a natural cleanse as this is where yeast is most likely to develop first.You can also purchase yogurt in a capsule (Acidophilus) at the health food store and insert it vaginally in place of regular yogurt.\u00a0\u00a0But, check with your Doctor first before trying.",
