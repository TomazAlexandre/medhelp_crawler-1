            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to take a full history and examine you, I can not assess what the cause of your symptoms is, and I cannot give you a diagnosis. However, I will give you some more information about your question.Burning sensation in hands and feet is usually a symptom suggesting a problem in the peripheral nerves (peripheral neuropathy). The peripheral nervous system is in general terms composed of nerves traveling from the spinal cord to the periphery, carrying sensory and motor information. When a patient has problems affecting the nerves, this can manifest in multiple forms, such as burning, tingling, numbness, abnormal sensation in the skin, and even weakness. Patients can have one of these symptoms, more than one, or all of them, and it does not mean that if you have one, you are going to get all of them. The symptom usually manifest in the area provided by the affected nerve, however it is common that a neuropathy affect more than one site.When the nerve affected is only one, this usually is caused by a local problem, such as trauma to a nerve, compression by something pressing on it. However the neuropathies that manifest in both hands and feet usually are caused by some conditions that affect multiple nerves. These neuropathies usually affect hands, feet or both in a symmetric fashion (right side and left side affected equally), and usually patients state that they feel the symptoms in a \u201cglove and stocking\u201d distribution.\u00a0\u00a0The list of conditions that affect the nerves is extensive, being common ones diabetes and vitamin deficiencies. Other causes are some specific medications or drugs, previous exposure to toxins, liver disease, kidney disease, hereditary and familial conditions, infections and many others.There are medications to treat the symptoms of a peripheral neuropathy, and many medications can be used to treat the pain, burning and tingling that patients experience. The list of medications to treat the symptoms include some antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and analgesics. However when a patient complains of symptoms suggestive of a peripheral neuropathy, it is important to look for the cause, because this is what should be treated, not only the symptom. For example, if the neuropathy is caused by vitamin deficiency, the vitamin should be supplemented; but if it is caused by diabetes or an infectious process, the therapy should be targeted to control the underlying condition.I cannot give you a diagnosis based on the information that you provide, however it may be important and helpful to see a neurologist, in order to find the cause of your symptoms, and treat not only the symptoms but the cause of them. The work up may be very simple such as some blood tests, however if the diagnosis is not easy, you may need more complex tests such as EMG studies, imaging studies, or more specific tests.I can unfortunately not tell you whether or not you have a neuropathy, but seeing a neurologist may help you with your symptoms and may lead to a diagnosis.I hope I have answered your questions, good luck.",
