    "question": "Can you point us please where to go next?\u00a0\u00a0My husband (58) who is fit, very active, no diabetes, BP 120/80, cholesterol normal and all bloods in normal range (except very high lipase and at times, very high amylase).\u00a0\u00a0This has now been monitored over three years.\u00a0\u00a0He had two years with no alcohol and the levels remained high.\u00a0\u00a0He went on a holiday ten months ago, ate only Asian food, drank alcohol again and on return, the tests were NORMAL. Now, ten months later - Lipase up around 3,600 (yes, always that high) and amylase up a bit. He originally presented after severe upper abdo pain R side, nausea, sweating.\u00a0\u00a0This resolved slowly and he presented to a Dr about 4 days later, and was thought to have had pancreatitis.\u00a0\u00a0All subsequent tests and scans normal, including test for cholecystitis.\u00a0\u00a0Only remarkable point was fatty liver but this has not been seen as particularly problematic. He is on no medicaition at all.Who should we consult further about this???ThankyouRobann",
