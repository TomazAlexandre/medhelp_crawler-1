            "answer": "Yes, and\u00a0\u00a0when your blood sugars get/stay so high, the neuropathy your husband has in his legs gets much worse and hurts much more. and the reason he doesn't make sense is also caused by his blood sugars. I have Diabetes myself and when my NS are high like that it's somewhat like being drunk.\u00a0\u00a0And when you are sick, your BS go way up.",

            "answer": "Hi, I didn't know there was a comment from you and I am glad\u00a0\u00a0I found it.\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, I know all about it, and have had Diabetes since age 17. (I am now 51)After I graduated with a BS in Nursing from College, I worked on a medical/research combination floor at New York Hospital in NYC.At the time this very valuable research was being conducted, among other things, by a Dr. Lois Jovanovic re: 'Pregnancy and Diabetes'. it was truly excellent research and we worked together on this for three years. (Dr. Jovanovic is now the CEO and President at Samsung Diabetes Institute in Santa Barbara, CA). We still keep in touch. Are you familiar with her?I have been feeling pretty lousy since my last chemo (Abraxabe) last Tuesday. I think I have an infection as my blood sugars have been running very high and that has been unusual lately since I eat so little on the chemo. Also fever and my ears hurt. last time my ears hurt it was brain mets.I think having type 2 Diabetes is even harder than the insulin dependent one. These people feel so alone and isolated and bad and guilty because they can't get it right and every page of a magazine like Diabetes Forecast? is filled with healthy, beautiful, winners, exercise, and willpower which makes the ordinary person feel even worse, that is, until she gets to visit with the Dietician. (I call her the Depression catalyst) Who cares about Miss America and her perfect Diabetes? Who cares about the long distance runner who managed to outrun the non diabetic.Anyway, yes, I have much to say on the subject. And now with the cancer on top of it, I was told nothing...nothing, and that is because oncology knows nothing about helping you control your diabetes during cancer treatment, and nobody else does, either.\u00a0\u00a0So i had to figure all this out myself. Like the Decadron they add to your chemo, or which one needs to take during brain radiation? I needed four times the amount of Insulin I did without it.I think I have talked enough. One thing that really helped me most with eating and controlling my blood sugars better was taking prozac.Good night, Katrin\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PS: My sleep cycle is also totally off!",

            "answer": "I'm not sure what I am doing. This is the first time I have done this and not sure how to post a question. Yet I also have weak legs yet and I am a type 1 diabetic since I was 7 yrs old, the reason my legs are weak is because I have a thing called Anticardiolipid Antibodies and Lupus. My blood is very thick right now ( at 0.3 ) I can't take any blood thinners because after taking coumadin for over 20 years I starting bleeding. In 2007 I had almost a gallon of blood between my heart and my heart sac after having that fixed and being in a coma for two months I turned around and bleed into my left lung. We tried asprin yet after getting up to taking 2600 mgs every day and that doing nothing I stopped taking it. Is there anything else I might ask my doctor's about to help thin out my blood? I am 49 years old and so far I have had 4 P.E.'s at the same time, an arotic anuersym that broke in an airplane, my right kidney blew up at home and removed in the hospital also\u00a0\u00a0have had 4 right brain strokes, 3 heart attacks and have started having seizures since the year of 2000. My day is always filled with extreme pain, even after taking my pain meds I am at a 7. I am thinking of going to a pain clinic to help me with the pain. Do you think it might help or is it a waist of my time? Thank you for taking your time in reading this..Cassie",

            "answer": "hi, I just want to respond to you about the posting. It is best to start your own post and not ask your own under someone else's post unless you are responding to them. The doctor may see this as he is very good and careful about responding but he may not and in this case it may help if in addition to this one, you copy and past this with a short new title in the main section. you can call it anything you want that relates to your question?I am also not sure that the doctor answers questions her at all times. it says that he works part time and that mean only some days, or some hours? it may tell you .Katrin",

I am not that familiar with this forum either and the doctor comes and goes I think. When he returns, they will announce it and then you can post. It will be really easy.Let me tell you a few things about MedHelp. For many subjects they have both 'expert forums' and then 'communities' where the people who post are not experts, yet, they are often quite helpful and also just to look at other questions although your problem is not close to an average one. but also, many of the expert forums are not really in 'working condition' or you do not get much help at all and the usual answer is. \"only your doctor knows best\" it's a legal thing that they cannot advise you over the Internet. I posted here and found Dr. Nicolson to be quite exceptional with his responses. They are timely, and he really listens and cares, and he offers\u00a0\u00a0interest as well, and really says as much as he knows and can.try this just for practice. scroll down and on the right side you will get to a place called 'Related communities' and you will see 'Autoimmune diseases community'. Go there and on the top of the page is a blue box that says 'post question', Again, I am not familiar with this community. I myself mostly answer questions on the 'breast cancer forum' and we are very good and knowledgeable but then this is not for you.I am really sorry about your struggles, and I don't know enough about what you are going through to be helpful.There are also other forums like 'Family Medicine', and I am not sure, but look around.Again, it must have been so frustrating to try and figure this out when that was impossible. but this is an exception here and you will be able to post elsewhere and soon again here.I live in Eugene, and I once saw a naturalpathic doctor in Hubbard many years ago.Take care, KAT",
