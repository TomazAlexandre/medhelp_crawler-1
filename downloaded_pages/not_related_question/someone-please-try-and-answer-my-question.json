            "answer": "I'm sorry you're going through this!The first thing I would encourage you is to stay off Dr. Google - he doesn't know your full medical history, and he will tell you bad news that is scary.\u00a0\u00a0I have been sucked into that myself, so learn from my mistakes!Secondly, when was the last time you had a full check up done?\u00a0\u00a0It wouldn't hurt to go see your doctor and discuss your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, so I can't diagnose.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms you're describing can be attributed to anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0Even when we don't feel anxious or panicky, it may still manifest in physical symptoms.As for feeling weak when you first wake up, make sure you're eating a good, balanced diet - protein and fiber will fill you up and give you energy.\u00a0\u00a0Drink plenty of water.Hang in there - better days are coming!\u00a0\u00a0Let us know how you're doing!",

            "answer": "I get shaky from time to time, and even feel like I'm going to pass out if I don't eat something. My Dr. explained to me in the past that THIS IS NOT A SIGN of diabetes, it's just that sometimes we do get low blood sugar, and we just need to eat something. It also doesnt mean we have \"LOW BLOOD SUGAR\" disease or anything. It just happens.What you are probably doing is having some minor low blood sugar hits, and when you eat, you feel better, but then you start having anxiety about it, which can mimic these exact same symptoms.Again I don't have this issue a lot, maybe once or twice a year, but it's not a big deal.I'd go to the Dr. just to get peace of mind. :) I'm sure you are fine.",

    "question": "Sometime I feel week if I don't eat. In the morning when I first get up I feel shakey. Once I eat I feel better. I am 28 125 lbs never had high or low blood sugar but after reading too much online I think I might have diabeties. Now they explaine excessive thirst I don't know what defines excessive thirst but I am thirsty who's not? I don't pee excessively but I'm not drinking water excessively. I haven't had a sweating problem. But occasionally my fingers or hands will fell a bit tingely\u00a0\u00a0but I wonder if that my my anxiety or poor circulation because i sit all day. I'm really scared it's diabeties. I've had glouclose tolerance tests when I was pregnant and they came back normal like 15 months ago. My dad has diabeties but it's only because he's over weight. No family history. Your thoughts???? I'm also scared I am hypoglicemeia but I'm just running with what I read online. I feel shakey in the morning when I wake up usualu just the first hour I'm awake and force myself to eat and I feel better I'm not even Hungary that early but I force myself to eat. Idk If I'm just Hungary it have something wrong with me. But I feel better after I eat",
