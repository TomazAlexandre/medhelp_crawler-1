    "question": "I am 72 years of age.In excellent health.I have been a runner, 5 to 10 miles for 35 years.Since a fall while running 2 years ago I have had back pain.X-Rays and MRI have revealed disc problems and some arthritis.My doctor recommended I continue running or at least walking and I still run, inside and outside.I've noticed that my problems are least evident and I feel my best when I am running and immediately after.I always have some discomfort, mild pain in my lower back and that sometimes moves into my upper leg or legs.The past year I have been experiencing numbness in my feet.\u00a0\u00a0At first it was just the sole of one foot.\u00a0\u00a0Now it affects my entire right foot and the left one to a lesser extent.Please tell me what's happening and what can be done?",
