            "answer": "This may represent a yeast infection. Usually the underlying skin would be red and inflamed. You can get this if you are taking antibiotics for another problem, but also this can occur if you have sugar in your urine (diabetes).An allergic reaction to a drug, even though it\u00a0\u00a0is not placed in the area, is a possible but unlikely cause, also. This is called a fixed drug reaction.You can try an antifungal cream and see if this solves the problem, but a urinalysis is a good idea in any case to rule out diabetes..S.A.Liroff, M.D.",
