            "answer": "Hi vtgrl,As I understand it there has been a lot of debate about what level you should treat TSH with the old scale being greater than 5 and the newer scale being significantly less than that.\u00a0\u00a0The endocrinologists however are split on which to choose.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps you could check oyt the top thyroid docs site-google it- and see if one of the recommened docs is inyour area.\u00a0\u00a0 They get there as people recommend them due to thier patient skills, flexibility and open mindedness so maybe you could find a good one.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No guarentee as my first nutcase endo came off that list, but it is a place to start;Dr. Mark,Sorry to hop on the thread and be off topic but i wanted to say thanks Dr.Mark.\u00a0\u00a0 I wrote awhile back with the TSH of 150 and taking florinef.\u00a0\u00a0 I was feeling really bad in the afternoon with the 0.1 mg florinef and the 25ug dose levoxyl.\u00a0\u00a0AMs were great but PMs were really bad with lots of ligament pain and general illness.\u00a0\u00a0 You said to consider T3 2X a day.\u00a0\u00a0 I was away from the new endo for five weeks so T3 wasn't possible in the near future.\u00a0\u00a0 I started taking small doses of T4 when the ickiness would start and felt much, much better.\u00a0\u00a0 I am taking 25 ug T4 at 6 am and at noon now and expirimenting with a low dose towards the late afternoon if I start feeling yucky. I have been reading a bunch at the thyroid manager site about T4 metabolism and it seems like being hypothyroid causes all the transport,\u00a0\u00a0catalytic and receptor proteins to be expressed oddly. I guess if you are really hypo then they are expressed really oddly!\u00a0\u00a0In any case !Thank You! for all your help and thanks for taking time to give advice to those in need!",

            "answer": "The T4 is a little low - may consider a slight increase in synthroid (I don't recall your dose).The trigs are high and HDL low -- that is a common combination and a medication such as tricor may be appopriate to help both.\u00a0\u00a0Would also do a 2 hour glucose tolerance test to make sure you don't have pre-diabetes or diabetes -- sometimes associated with your low HDL and high TRIGS.",

    "question": "Hello, I am a 27yo female (5'7, 115 lbs), and I have had repeated problems with fatigue and cold intolerance for about two years. My GP did some bloodwork after I was having trouble exercising, and it turns out that I was anemic (Hgb of 9). Iron-supplementation corrected the anemia, which really helped with the exercise. However, I still get cold VERY easily, as I am sometime shaking at my desk while other people are quite warm. My fingertips turn purple. I also have a hard time doing anything but laying on the couch on the weekends, even though I am a go-getter at heart. I am not on any medicines except for a low-dose OCP. My hair also seems to be much thinner than it used to be.I have had 3 TSH measurements in the past year, as I have also had trouble with classic migraines (which subsided after the anemia went away). They were 4.15, 3.85 and 3.3. Both my GP and the neurologist said that these measurements were in the \"normal\" range and no action was needed, but then I have read many studies that suggest that my symptoms could be caused by low thyroid function and that ideally I should be closer to 1.0. My 90yo grandmother has taken thyroid supplements for many years, but my mother and older half-sister are so far OK.I don't want to be a nag and keep asking my doctor about it, but at the same time I am troubled by the fact that I'm young and healthy but many times have no energy. I would love some advice on whether I should follow up on this or not, or what other conditions could cause these symptoms if my values are OK. Thanks!",
