            "answer": "Without seeing the scans and the biopsy I can not tell you what this represents. If you are concerned obtaining a second opinion with another spine surgeon is reasonable. Try to have the biopsy slides also reviewed by another pathologist. This will confirm the initial result. If this is determined to be benign, then following it up with a scan may be reasonable.However, the symptoms in his arms may not be related to the lesion. Perhaps also seeing a neurologist to confirm that no other disorder is occurring would also be reasonable. Good luck.",

    "question": "Good MorningMy 31 year old son has a spine lesion in the T3 vertebrae bone, with nuclear cell activity.He Has DDD , he had a L 5 spine fusion three years ago, he has diabetes type two. His blood tests came back normal, except for a very slight white cell elevation.CT scans of stomach and pelvis and chest were normal.He has pain right where the lesion is near the\u00a0\u00a0shoulder blade.He had a MRI, Full body bone scan and a bone biopsy. The biopsy came back benign.He gets weakness\u00a0\u00a0and numbness in his fingers.The orthopedic spine surgeon suggested not doing a surgical biopsy because it would be from the same area.The lesion has not\u00a0\u00a0changed in the past three months since they found it. He suggested coming back for another MRI in three months to see if there are any changes.Meanwhile they started my son on vicodin and vioxx. He has had pain for 6 months.The doctor said: just because the bone biopsy came back benign and the blood test are normal, does not mean that something could be going onand could be slow growing.Any suggestions would be appreciated.Thank youLight7",
