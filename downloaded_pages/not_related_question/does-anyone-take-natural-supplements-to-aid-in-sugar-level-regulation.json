            "answer": "Excerpt from Diabetes Self Management - Magnesium: The Forgotten Healer...\"The NIH says, \u201cMagnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body\u2026 [It] is involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis.\u201d And according to our own Amy Campbell, \u201cResults from three very large studies indicate that people who consume a diet rich in magnesium have a lower risk of getting Type 2 diabetes.\u201dPeople with diabetes are more likely than those without to be low in magnesium. According to an article on About.com, \u201cElevated blood glucose levels increase the loss of magnesium in the urine, which in turn lowers blood levels of magnesium.\u201d So getting enough magnesium is especially important in diabetes.In spite of these benefits, medical authorities rarely recommend magnesium. That\u2019s why I call it the forgotten mineral.\"",
