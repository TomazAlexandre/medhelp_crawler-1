I haven't been to the doctor yet, because at first I thought it was a virus that would pass on by, and then I thought that my anxiety was making it worse.I did sleep propped up last night for the first time and I had noticeably less pain. Still a slight feeling of hunger (the gurgling, empty feel) but not the intense pain I usually have at night. I don't know if that's significant...",

            "answer": "Update:\u00a0\u00a0For the past several nights I've slept sitting up. The pain is better. I still feel nauseous upon waking, but nothing like before. I still get a bit of anxiety, but I think that's just my usual anxiety worrying about what my stomach will feel like in the morning,etc.Since sleeping sitting up, I only wake up once a night, or not at all. One night I went 8 straight hours!! First time in a month or so. If I do wake up once, it's usually after 3-4 hours or so, so I'm going longer. During the day the pain is much better. I haven't been getting the intense, gnawing hunger pains. It's more of a general discomfort and sometimes a burning right under my sternum area. Yesterday I went several hours without eating. The pain and burping up bile gets worse as the evening approaches though.Anyway, I'm thinking that it's acid reflux. Hopefully that's all!Any more input is greatly appreciated!",

            "answer": "It's reassuring if periods of hunger are becoming more infrequent.\u00a0\u00a0If hunger is persistent, and requires frequent eating to relieve, it could be considered to be a positive Whipple's triad if the blood sugar is low during an episode.\u00a0\u00a0It's important to be examined by a doctor during an episode to get the blood sugar recorded.\u00a0\u00a0If it is truly low, other than an insulinoma, adrenal insufficiency, tumors, and factious hypoglycemia (taking diabetes medicines without the problem of diabetes so the sugar goes too low) are possible concerns.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms of low blood sugar from tumors are usually less dramatic since the sugar lowers gradually and oftentimes doesn't have the \"fight-or-flight\" symptoms, heart racing, sweating etc.",

I went 4 hours before eating again after lunch (and I only ate because it had been 4 hours, not because I was in pain) and 5 hours after eating dinner. The pain is still worse at night though, and in the morning.Can acid reflux, or GERD, make my stomach sensitive to the touch? It's especially tender in the middle, right under my ribs, and also a bit tender going all the way down the middle of my stomach. It also is tender and producing slight discomfort in my upper abdomen when bending over or sitting hunched. This is noticeably worse in the morning and evening.Also, can acid reflux just appear out of nowhere? Or maybe I always had subtle signs that never registered...Thank you!",

    "question": "I am a 24 year old female. For the past month or so I feel starving all the time. It's the feeling of a gurgling stomach and intense, sickening gnawing hunger pain underneath the gurgling. It makes me immediately start sweating, I get hot and feel that I'll be sick (faint, throw up, etc.) if I don't eat immediately. I run into the kitchen and drink milk and eat oatmeal, peanut butter toast, etc. Sometimes eating makes the pain go away for for maybe an hour, but then the pain starts again, and sometimes eating doesn't make the pain go away at all. I can't sleep through the night. I wake up about every 1 to 2 hours with the pain, pounding heart, dizziness and sweating. I eat a granola bar and fall back asleep for a bit until I wake up with the same thing again. Mornings are horrible. When I wake up I feel dizzy, faint, hungry, and the gnawing hunger pain in my stomach. I've gained 10 pounds because I eat all the time, and I'm don't exercise anymore because of the pain and fear that I'll faint.Other issues I'm having are: excessive gas, bloating, burping up bile, diarrhea in the mornings and increased bowel movements. I also suffer from anxiety. When I start getting the hunger feeling I worry that my blood sugar is low and that sends me into an anxiety attack. The pain also sends me into an anxiety attack because it hurts so bad and I don't know what's going on. The lack of sleep, no exercise, weight gain, constant eating, and inability to go out are ruining my life and making my anxiety worse. I've been taking 40mg of Pepcid AC\u00a0\u00a0every day for a month and I don't think it's helping.For the past month I drank a Slim Fast every morning, and a month's worth of Slim Fast was just recalled because they might be contaminated with Bacillus Cereus. I thought maybe that was the problem, but I haven't had a Slim Fast in about a week and my problems remain. I don't know if the two things are related or just circumstantial.",
