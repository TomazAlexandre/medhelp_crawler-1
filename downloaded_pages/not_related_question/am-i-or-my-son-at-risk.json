    "question": "My father passed away a few months ago from a massive heart attack at the age of 57. After learning that all of his aunts and uncles had passed away from a heart attack before the age of 60, I am now wondering if I am at risk for a heart defect? He was in okay health, active, non-smoker, but did not eat well and was overweight. He hadn't seen a doctor for as long as I knew him, but I know he had high blood preassure. My mother opted not to have an autopsy done, figuring it was a general clogged artery, but now I'm questioning if I or my son could be at risk if this is a common thread between the family deaths. I am 28 and in great health as far as I know. Thanks for any advice you can give...",
