            "answer": "The thing that most confuses me is that the Endo mentioned if it were Graves, the uptake would have been high and if it were thyroiditis the uptake should much less than mine was (I think he said no uptake).\u00a0\u00a0He frankly looked like he was getting results he didnt expect and then just said \"since your pulse is still so high and you are having a hard time keeping up with the baby, let's slow it down a bit.\u00a0\u00a0See you in 2 months\".Can thyroiditis triggered by pregnancy last this long?\u00a0\u00a0Or could this be an \"atypical\" case of Graves like he said?",

    "question": "Hello, I need help understanding my results.\u00a0\u00a0My doc has still not asked me my symptoms and only cares about measurable ones. *sigh*\u00a0\u00a0I am 39 and have a 13 month old.\u00a0\u00a0I had severe hyperemesis during the ENTIRE pregnancy. I lost about 25 pounds during the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0About 3 months post-partum I was still generally unwell. I thought it was due to the effects of the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Then I was feeling breathless, heart racing, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I have no tolerance for heat (sometimes my hands and feet feel like ice) frequent stools, occasional tingling in hands, problems sleeping and muscle soreness.After seeing a cardiologist for my heart (88-135 beats a minute resting).\u00a0\u00a0He said my heart is in excellent shape after a stress test and EKG. I then asked my GP and she ran a hormone panel.Test results3/12/08Free t4: .88 (reference range: .59-1.25), TSH: .32 (.34-4.82) cholesterol: 229 (<200), LDL: 162 (<100), All others were in the Normal range (DHEA, FSH, LH, Progesterone, Prolactin, Testosterone, Estradiol)I was seeing an Endo for my diabetes (type 2) when he noticed the goiter, then saw the test results in my file which the GP had sent.\u00a0\u00a0He put me on simvastatin, requested more blood tests:04/05/08TSH: .15 (.34-4.82), thyroglobulin antibodies: <20 (reference <20 IU.mL), thyroid peroxidase antibodies <10 (<35 IU/mL), T3 total: 165 (60-181 ng/dL), LDL Cholesterol 177.\u00a0\u00a0 Also ultrasound: no nodules, large goiter.RAIU results: 5% uptake at 4 hours, tech said very large goiter no nodulesLast week, Endo said it seem \"atypical\" for Graves; but since I have a family history and my heart rate is so high plus a hard time functioning (excessive energy, occasional fatigue, trouble getting to sleep, serious irritability, etc) he wanted to slow down the thyroid. He ran an additional test: 05/19/08:T4, Thyroxine: 8.5 (4.8-13.9) and TSH is now down to 0.11 (.34-4.82).I'm on 5mg of Methimazole 2x/day.Is this Graves I\u2019m lost!",
