            "answer": "Diabetes insipidus(water diabetes) is due to a hormone lacking that helps us hold onto water, these children will urinate excessively, drink excessively, lose weight and be sick with high sodiums, there is a form due to the pituitary hormone lacking and that which is due to the kidney not responding to the normal hormone.It does not sound like repeated fevers alone is diabetes insipidus.
