            "answer": "Hi,Mostly likely you hit a vein so that the insulin was able to go directly into your blood stream and be metabolized quickly.\u00a0\u00a0This is not a very usual situation.This is one reason why theoretically we are supposed to pull back the syringe a little before injecting to be sure we haven't accidently hit a vessel.\u00a0\u00a0However, most people don't do this.An alternative thought; is there any chance you could have injected your fast acting\u00a0\u00a0instead of your long acting (I have done that once and spent about 6 hours sitting up drinking sweet tea and monitoring blood sugar until it was stable).",

            "answer": "Hi,Yes, I am doing fine.There is a saying Your Diabetes May Vary YDMV.\u00a0\u00a0Basically this means that we're all different and how we react to medications can also vary.Put it down to experience, I guess.\u00a0\u00a0The main thing is to test sugar levels frequently enough to know what is happening, and also to test if you feel strange.Hope you have a great weekend too.",

    "question": "Took 30 units Lantus at night, and hit a small vein, had blood. Sugar level started rapidly going down 15 mins later.. over 100 points within a half hour, and still dropping. It went from 280 to 125 within an hour; the urgent care said to call 911, and paramedics helped me, but, the doctor at ER wasn't 'sure' exactly how the Lantus did this.. anyone have similar experience ?",
