            "answer": "Hi,Based on your fasting tests, I would say that you do not have diabetes, and often a fasting test is more than adequate. Random blood sugars during the day in the range of the 130's as you report are also normal.If you want another assessment that is a step further than the fasting blood test, a 2-hour glucose challenge will help tell if you are completely normal, have diabetes or are somewhere in between. It is a very good test as well.Please do not worry too much about this and continue\u00a0\u00a0testing yourself over and over again. Your symptoms can come from many other potential sources and are not at all specific to diabetes. So I would suggest getting this last 2 -hour glucose challenge test and if normal, go about your life living as healthy as possible to prevent diabetes in the future.Take care.",

            "answer": "OK, if fasting glucose is all your dr. is doing... that's not enough. You need to do 2 hour fasting oral glucose with a fasting test, a test at 1 hour after drinking a 75 G drink of glucose solution and a 2 hour test.\u00a0\u00a0My fasting tests usually come back in a good range as well, but my 1 and 2 hour test after drinking the glucose drink are well over 200 which is all it takes to diagnose diabetes.If you have a monitor and are \"randomly\" doing testing... all I can say, is quit doing it randomly.\u00a0\u00a0For 3-4 days in a row test at these times.Wake up:1 hour after breakfast:2 hours after breakfast:1 hour after lunch:2 hours after lunch:1 hour after dinner:2 hours after dinner:Also if you have a snack with sugar in it... test at 1 hour and 2 hours after it.\u00a0\u00a0Eat exactly like you do any other day to get the best readings.\u00a0\u00a0If you 2 hour ones are above 140 then go back to the dr. and ask him to give you the 2 hour oral glucose test.",
