            "answer": "The Lean Cuisine and Smart Ones personal meals work well for me. While they have approximately the same amount of carbs the fat content is really low (which makes my bloodsugar levels easier to control since the carbs are being released quickly-like normal- and not being released over a long period of time...this makes it substantially easier to control my bg).
