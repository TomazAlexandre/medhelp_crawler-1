    "question": "4 months back my weight was Kg 77. So I have decided to maintain the weight loss, for that I have controlled my diet. I had consumed only fruits and juices at night. And I had taken 'Bragg apple cider vinegar. And consumed plenty of water. Now my weight is Kg 66. I thought that this weight loss was due to my diet and frequent urination was due to plenty of water consumption. Last week I went to hospital and I have checked my health condition. Pasting blood sugar was 208 and post breakfast was 358, A1c >12%, c-Pepatite: 0.53. Doctor has doubt that it is Type-1 and he suggested for insulin. So I visited other hospital and they told that it is Type-2.\u00a0\u00a0I have asked them how did you decided this is Type-2. They answered that if it is Type-1 then you will not be appeared like this and you don't have symptoms. They have started treatment with tablets. Now my random sugar is 113( After one week of medication). Can you suggest me whether it is Type-1 or Type-2?",
