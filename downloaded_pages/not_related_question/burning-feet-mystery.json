            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Your symptoms of burning in the feet can be consistant with peripheral neuropathy, which is a condition caused by damage to the small nerves in your legs, usually happens in a length-dependant fashion, meaning it typically affects the peripheral parts first then as time goes by it can progress to involve more proximal areas like the legs.There are different causes for peripheral neuropathy, the common ones include Diabetes, thyroid disease, vitamin/mineral deficiency (like vitamin B12, folate, copper), alcoholism.You need to be examined by a neurologist to detect any neurological deficits, in typical neuropathy there might be some loss of sensation perception in the affected areas. Then workup involves lab work to detect the common causes of neuropathy (check for diabetes or \"pre-diabetes\", thyroid disease, vitamin levels, protein abnormalities...etc), depending on the result of the neurological exam and the initial workup you might need some additional testing to detect any nerve damage (this might include electro-diagnostic testing with EMG or nerve conduction studies, nerve/skin biopsy..etc)treatment includes treating any underlying condition (if any is detected), and symptomatic treatment for pain control, several medications can be used, like Neurontin, Lyrica, Cymbalta...etc.Thanks for using the forum. Good luck.",

I just posted on the Orthopedic Board, but would you be so kind to answer here. I am trying to get int o see a neurosurgeon possibly for spine surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you - here's the post.I am 38 yo female, in reasonably good health.\u00a0\u00a0A bit overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I have been dealing with back/neck issues for years (26 to be exact seeing a chiropractor).\u00a0\u00a0I was hit by a drunk driver when 12 had severe cervical sprain at that time.\u00a0\u00a0Fast forward through a lot of pain and appointments to when I was 34.\u00a0\u00a0Diagnosed with DDD or osteoarthritis.\u00a0\u00a0I've had 3 lumbar MRI's, two cervical and one brain because they thought I had MS most recently which I do not.\u00a0\u00a0EVERYTHING has been ruled out and I will post all that info as well, but I wanted to give you my most recent MRI's within last 3 months and let me know if you think I am heading for surgery soon.\u00a0\u00a0I am in a lot of pain in all 3 areas.\u00a0\u00a0Cervical - neck/arm/shoulder pain.\u00a0\u00a0Thoracic - pain in mid-back - heartburn (related?) never had it before - Lumbar - the MOST pain.\u00a0\u00a0No sciatica like pain in one leg, but lower back pain, aching like pain down backs of both legs and into feet with burning feet when I sit for long periods.\u00a0\u00a0Neurologist\u00a0\u00a0exam revealed no reflexes in ankles (haven't for 3 years)\u00a0\u00a0and mute bilateral plantar reflexes.\u00a0\u00a0There's so much more info, but I'll stop here.\u00a0\u00a0Any comments on these MRI's?\u00a0\u00a0THANK YOU so much.MRI Thoracic Spine without Contrast - 10/07. T1, T2 and T2 fat saturation sagittal sequences, and T1 and T2 weighted axial images were obtained.\u00a0\u00a0The vertebrae are normally aligned.\u00a0\u00a0The stature of the vertebral bodies is maintained.\u00a0\u00a0Disk spaces appear to be preserved.\u00a0\u00a0The spinal cord is of normal signal and morphology.\u00a0\u00a0 At T7-8 there is is a small right paramedian protrusion of the nucleus polposus which effaces the ventral aspect of the thecal sac and appears to touch the cord.\u00a0\u00a0There is no foraminal stenosis seen.Impression:\u00a0\u00a0Small right paramedian protrusion of the nucleus pulposus at T7-8. This small protrusion appears to touch the ventral aspect of the spinal cord, but there is no evidence of spinal or foraminal stenosis.\u00a0\u00a0The spinal cord is unremarkable in appearance and signal.MRI Cervical Spine without Contrast - Oct/07.\u00a0\u00a0The vertebrae are normally aligned.\u00a0\u00a0Stature of the vertebral bodies is maintained.\u00a0\u00a0Spinal cord is of normal morphology with exception of ventral impression on the cord in the left paramedian location at C6-7 secondary to moderate protrusion of the nucleus pulposus.\u00a0\u00a0There is no evidence of tonsillar herniation, and the foramen magnum is normal in appearance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is mild/moderate broad-based bulging in the disk/endplate complex at C5-6, but this finding does not cause impression on the spinal cord, there is no spinal or foraminal stenosis at this level.Impression:\u00a0\u00a0Significant protrusion of the nucleus pulposus at C6-7, finding is positioned in the left paramedian location and causes mild ventral impression on the spinal cord.\u00a0\u00a0It is also possible that this finding may impinge the traversing left C8 root.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise unremarkable MRI of the cervical spine.Lumbar Spine 12/31/07.\u00a0\u00a0Results:\u00a0\u00a0Normal through L3/4 level.\u00a0\u00a0 L4/L5 level: There are some mild deg facet changes w/out other significant deg osseous changes. The disk is narrowed and dessicated and does show a broad base disc bulge with a small central disc protrusion. There is also some increased signal in the posterior annulus which could be due to a small tear. These findings do cause mild canal stenosis and foraminal recess narrowing. The neural foramina themselves show minimal narrowing without affecting the exiting nerves. The spinal nerve roots are normal.L5/S1 level. Minimal facet arthropathy is present without other bony degenerative changes. The disc is narrowed and dessicated with a mild broad base disc bulge with a small to moderate central protrusion which appears to abut up against the proximal left S1 exiting nerve and possibly the right S1 exiting nerve. No significant canal stenosis is identified. The foramina bilaterally show no significant narrowing. The exiting L5 nerves are unaffected.

            "answer": "There is a type of neuropathy that does not show up on Never Conduction Studies called Small Fiber Neuroapthy. It is not always length dependent. It can be patchy and diffuse. It is very difficult to find a neurologist who knows anything about it, and most will deny it's existence, so if you want the correct tests and help for it you will have to go to a major academic medical center like Johns Hopkins, University of Pittsburgh or Cleveland Clinic. It is often idiopathic,which means that no one knows what causes it.Here are some links with more info:http://www.thecni.org/reviews/13-2-p07-treihaft.htmhttp://www.hopkinsneuro.org/peripheral_nerve/disease.cfm/condition/Small_Fiber_Sensory_Neuropathyhttp://cms.clevelandclinic.org/neuroscience/body.cfm?id=413http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12210380&dopt=AbstractPlushttp://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/62/10/1574I hope that helps.",

I have had 6 epidural steroid injections in 04/05 and 3 in the right SI Joint.\u00a0\u00a0Was ok for a little while.\u00a0\u00a0Now, it's just getting worse and worse, the stenosis.\u00a0\u00a0I also had a + Romberg's (balance) in my neuro's office.\"The symptoms of small fiber sensory neuropathy are primarily sensory in nature and include unusual sensations such as pins-and-needles, pricks, tingling and numbness. Some patients may experience burning pain or coldness and electric shock-like brief painful sensations. Since SFSN usually does not involve large sensory fibers that convey balance information to the brain or the motor nerve fibers that control muscles, these patients do not have balance problems or muscle weakness. In most patients, these symptoms start in the feet and progress upwards. In advanced cases, it may involve the hands. \"Thanks though, I appreciate you taking the time.Thank though for the website links.",

            "answer": "I suffer from burning/aching feet, at night and in the am before I get up. I haven't found an answer to the mystery but I have found japanese foot patches that provide some much needed relief. The theory is that for thousands of years they have been using a specific type of tree sap which, when applied to the soles of your feet overnight, draw a range of toxins out. Having tried a few different brands, some were more effective for me than others, and essentially you get what you pay for. I like Asunaro brand best, and you can find a few different suppliers if you look online. It buys me at least a few days.",

Finally got treatment two years ago. My Nuerologist said that gabepentin was the best hope for relief. I use to put frozed hand towels on my feet.Now I'm numb in feet working up my legs and my fingers.
