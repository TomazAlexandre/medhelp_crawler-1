            "answer": "Depression, lack of energy, loss of sexual interest, may be symptoms of low testosterone. Your physician has wisely chosen to repeat the test to confirm the value. Usually morning testosterones are highest though the variation in the course of the day tends to diminish as men get older. Generally, though, I would suggest a morning value along with a prolactin (another hormone that rarely is related to low testosterone) as well as a check on your thyroid function.If you do need hormone replacement it will need to be a life long treatment, just as diabetes requires life long care. The gels and patches give the closest to normal replacement levels. The patches, however, have a significant incidence of skin reactions. The pills are associated with liver tumors and the shots give extremely high levels of testosterone, much high than is normal. Thus, the gels are your best bet, in my opinion.You'll need your testosterone level repeated on treatment to make sure that you levels on treatment are in the normal range.S.A.Liroff, M.D.Depression, lack of energy, loss of sexual interest, may be symptoms of low testosterone.

            "answer": "Thank you.....My doctor will see me this week to do another blood test, and then perhaps\u00a0\u00a0I will start with some replacement therapy. I have good insurance...just hope they cover this. I am miserable.I here that going to an Endocrinologist is worthwhile or can a Primary Care Doc prescribe pataches, gel or give shots?",

    "question": "I have been feeling depressed, but mostly anxious now for a few years. I have tried several SSRI's and evenSt John's Wort and became very hypomanic- not pleasant at all. I had to stop them. Even tried benzos and they work but I don't want to become a benzo addict! Stopped them too.I finally went to my family doctor, who stated that my testosterone level is low--170, and told me to make an appt tocome in.Is depression/anxiety a symptom of low testosterone, and are the side effects of testosterone therapy ones that will increase hypomanic symptoms. I am a little worried?",
