            "answer": "Hi,First, hang in there. You are definitely in a tough situation, but you will make it.The Lyrica does work for many people but, like many of the other medicines for neuropathy, there is no guarantee and what works for some will not work for others. If your doctor can get you some samples or see if there is a free trial of the meds through the company's website this could take some stress off you financially(atleast until you are sure it works for you).Your glucose situation is very concerning and if you are not yet seeing an Endocrinologist then I suggest you request that referral as soon as possible. Those glucoses are way too high as you well know, and will worsen all possible end-organ disease of diabetes, including your neuropathy.The best combination of insulins is a long acting basal like lantus, combined with meal-time dosing of a shorter acting insulin like Lispro or even Regular insulin. It takes some finessing, but many folks can get much better control using this regimen. It does require several shots a day, atleast 4 actually because the Lantus is taken separately. But the control is worth it. If you then able to learn Carbohydrate counting and really get this down to a science, yo can get very good control. So please speak to your doc about that combination and start it soon. Getting your sugars down will likely also help your neuropathy symptoms in the shorter term. Meet with a nutritionist and diabetes educator as well to get all aspects of your care optimized.Good luck and take care.",

            "answer": "Thanks so much for the information. I would love to see an Endocrinologist but without insurance this will never happen but that's just the way it is here in American.I will certainly speak with my Doctor about the insulin program you mentioned and hopefully it will work out. For the last several days my fasting blood sugar hasn't even registered on my meter, I get a reading of 'HI' so I know it's very serious.I have one more question if it's not a bother. I'm a little concerned about my vision everything is starting to become pretty blurry, could this be a result of my HBS and can it lead to blindness?Again thank you for your time.Respectfully, Thomas",

    "question": "I have type 2 and have developed severe neuropathy throughout my body. My weight is normal I'm 45 years old. This last year has been very hard because I'm falling a lot and it has advanced to a point where it's very difficult to walk at all.I don't have insurance so getting the proper care is hard. I recently admitted to myself that I'm no longer able to work and I'm in the process of filing for disability.The question I have is this. My fasting blood sugar is extremely high 450+ every day, currently I'm doing Lantus but it does little good.I was doing Novolog 100 units a day but that didn't work either. I watch my diet and before I walked several miles a day.If this continues I'm going to lose the use of my legs completely but I don't know what I can do. I was on the sliding scale and I was given myself\u00a0\u00a010 + injections a day but that too failed to lower it.I have always providing for my family and not be able to has left me depressed and hopeless. I have been on several different medicines to relieve the pain even narcotics but had to stop because it was affecting my ability to work.My Doctor recently recommended Lyrica and it's pretty expensive but if I don't get some sort of relief I feel I'll go mad. My symptoms are feeling wet, banding around my torso, constant pain, extreme sensitivity to hot and cold the list is really endless.Does this medicine work? Before I put out this sort of money I was wondering if any one has had luck with it.Is there a way to lower my blood sugar by combining insulins? I hate complaining but I honestly feel that I'm at the point where I can't take it any more.If any one can offer some advise I'd be most greatful.",
