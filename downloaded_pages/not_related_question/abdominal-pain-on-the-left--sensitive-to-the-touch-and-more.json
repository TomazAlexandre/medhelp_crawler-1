            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Liver and pancreas problems cannot be detected by ultrasound only. For this you also need liver function tests, tests for hepatitis, serum amylase and lipase.Another possibility is Crohn\u2019s disease, which is a difficult entity to diagnose. An elevated ESR does confirm inflammation in the body. Low protein, minerals and iron in blood are the other findings in Crohn\u2019s which may or may not be present. These findings if present could be the cause of lack of energy apart from chronic inflammation being the cause. An upper GI series using barium dye is done to see the condition of small intestines. The degree of involvement of the large and small intestine may vary from person to person.\u00a0\u00a0A biopsy is the most confirmatory. A recent advancement in Crohn\u2019s diagnosis is video capsule endoscopy. Apart from Crohn\u2019s it can be any other inflammatory bowel condition such as IBS, Celiac, or ulcerative colitis could cause your symptoms. Possibility of H pylori infection of the stomach should be ruled out by carbon urea breath tests.If you are having recurrent UTI then there are two possibilities. One is that the antibiotic which you are taking is not effective against the micro-organism causing the infection. The other is that you have a stone in the urinary system, which though is asymptomatic is acting as the source of infection. It can also be due to a STD if you also get UTI after sex. Non specific bacterial infection,or fungal infection can also cause recurrent UTI. Diabetes is another cause.What you need is a urine culture and sensitivity test done. This will tell you what organism is causing the infection and what antibiotic will kill it permanently. Please do not take any antibiotic without this test because if the organism is not sensitive to the antibiotic, it will only sit quietly for some time and then flare up again. A simple urine test should also be done to look for RBC, leucocyte esterase enzyme, WBC etc. Recurrent bladder infection or UTI is very common in individuals with diabetes, especially if diabetes is not under control. Hence get gylcosylated hemoglobin or HbAc1 tested to know your last three months sugar control, and a recent fasting and two hour post meal sugar status.Please discuss with your doctor. I sincerely hope you will find this information useful in your journey towards better health.Hope you get well soon! Good Luck and take care!",

            "answer": "Now my abdomen is painful to the touch, especially in the middle and on the left. My endoscopy was clean, thyroid hormones seem to be normal. One diabetes test was normal, just did another one with a new doctor. Ultrasound of gull bladder, pancreas and liver seem to be normal as well. Now my migraines suddenly reappeared and I started having headaches after eating (not always). Doctor long time ago though it was IBS, but the symptoms don't seem to match IBS that much. Plus my recurrent UTIs (about 5-6 per year) started developing quicker somehow and became more severe. I also feel more tired than usual and periodically have pain under arm pits (to the touch), but no swelling. So yeah, most of my old doctors though I was stressed ... Yeah :) my neurologist was basically the one who unknowingly convinced me to look further. He started questioning diabetes and said that my symptoms should be investigated further. I'm still in a process of investigation, I just hope the new doctor is not going to give up even if all he regular tests are normal.... Anyone experienced something like that?",

    "question": "I've been having so many different symptoms since childhood, symptoms that doctors couldn't always explain, so nowadays I try to ignore most of them. Because I'm tired of doctors who don't go beyond regular tests to figure things out and start feeding useless meds. A few months ago I decided hat I want to take care of my health despite of all the negative experiences.I believe (and that's just my perception), that even though I started developing some minor symptoms in my late teens / early 20s (I'm 35 now), they really started developing more serious symptoms around age of 28, and developed some brand new unusual ones about 8 months ago.It all started with severe abdominal pain in one spot right in the middle of my stomach, sometimes it followed by nausea and vomiting and one or maybe a couple of times - fever. Doctor said it was gastritis without doing any tests. I changed diet, became more careful with food, what I eat. After a few years my symptoms disappeared but the painful spot in the middle of my stomach remained. Around the age of 32 my migraines (so called complicated migraines) became more severe suddenly, took care of them with topamax. Around he same time I got stomach flu, my family recovered within a week. It took me about 6-8 months to recover fully more or less. I didn't have severe symptoms, but my stomach was upset a lot, probiotics only made things worse. During that time I developed pain on the left right under rib, sometimes it would start in front and then radiates t the back, sometimes just the back. I would have really weird periods when I suddenly become very nauseas after eating something sweet, and then I suddenly stop feeling that way. Periodically I start experiencing pain and nausea right when I start eating. Last year new symptoms appear, I started retaining water (haven't experienced it for since my thyroid was treated at 21), and became extremely thirsty which is very unusual for me. I'll continue in the next message",
