            "answer": "I also had some fatty liver all this time, with my triglycerides : 225.8 mg/dL and cholesterol 220 mg/dL initially .Now, i have changed my diet, of course, try to eat healthy as much as i can .i have delayed the treatment for a few months, my doctor told me i had to chose what to do in November but i had some problems and had to delay the consult to this month . I only did my fibroscan which came f2 7.6 kp ( i typed wrong 7.2 kp in the initial post, but that can be from ALT or fatty liver,i had it in the past and gone back to f0 pretty quick .( my height is 170 cm and i have 76 kg. )Please advice me what to do next . My Doctor recommends me to start with Interferon because i am young and he aims to make the virus Inactive so i save some time before starting with nucs .I did not had a normal alt all this time, was kind of higher than normal ..It is very difficult to chose a proper treatment because it seems like all i would chose i could've done something better or i may be wrong .The entire blood test results will come at the end of this month and i can't wait much longer, i feel i have waited long enough anyway .",

            "answer": "Yes you waited too much.How old are you?Post your newest results when you have them as you don't have any recent results if I am reading correctly your post.Do blood test and ultrasound of your kidneys to see their current state as that might influence the decision of your choice of Hep B treatment, especially as you had some \"sand\" on your previous ultrasound.In any case you shall keep very healthy diet AND start exercising right away...and exercise regularly, in order to:a) loose weight and keep the fat out of your liver (you don't want to have fat in your liver as fat itself is damaging the liver, especially as you have hep B)b) not develop diabetes (diabetes damages kidneys and ultimately liver), tenofovir might not be the best choice if your kidneys are not good.",

            "answer": "i am 25 . the doctor delayed me for 6 months since i have discovered, that's the procedure here, to be sure it's not acute .than he delayed me another 6 months to see if alt goes down (thinking it can be in the imune phase and blaming the Fatty liver . and of course, like there wasn't enough going on with me, i had some problems in my personal life and had to take care of that . Now i'm aiming to start treatment i hope next month after the results are back",

            "answer": "Yes, even though it is unusual for your age to have that high cholesterol, so probably genetics contributed to that and you'll have to pay special attention to it and be more careful regarding it then an average person so that you don't develop heart disease, diabetes and reduce your liver fat.Keep a good diet with lots of daily natural/organic fruits and vegetables.Avoid sugars and saturated fat! Avoid diary products unless they are very fat-reduced products, pay special attention to fat in meat (avoid it like plague). Fish is the healthiest meat, chicken is generally healthier then red meat, totally avoid pork meat.Start with regular exercise (and once you muscles adjust to it keep exercising on at least 5 days per week for at least 30-40 minutes per day in a way that your significantly notice your breading. Walking is not sufficient...go for running or swimming).",
