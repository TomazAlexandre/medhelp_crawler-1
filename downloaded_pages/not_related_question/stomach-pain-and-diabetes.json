            "answer": "Michalo,As you may know, we're not physicians here; we are volunteers with a lot experience related to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Pls check out what you read here with your son's pediatric endocrinologist.I'm glad you clarified that the pain is not associated with ketones.Sometimes there can be digestive issues -- not necessarily related to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Can you relate the pain to foods causing severe gas \"in general\" or perhaps foods that he's uniquely intolerant to?\u00a0\u00a0Many folks with diabetes have difficulty with gluten/wheat products and others have trouble with dairy.\u00a0\u00a0Are there any patterns that suggest either of these food types might be a culprit?Any associated diarrhea or constipation or stressors in life?\u00a0\u00a0I agree with your parenting instincts that something is not right and encourage you to push further perhaps along the lines I've suggested here.\u00a0\u00a0If \"once in a while\" means weekly or even monthly, it's surely worth finding the source & a solution.There'll be quite a bit of information out there lactose intolerance (dairy related), Celiac (gluten/wheat related) or possibly Chrohn's disease (digestive tract).http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/crohns/http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/celiac/http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/lactoseintolerance/",

            "answer": "My daughter had the same thing last year.\u00a0\u00a0Every couple of weeks for about 8 months she would complain of stomach pain.\u00a0\u00a0School nurse called me at least 3 different times to tell me Em was in the office with a stomach ache but had no other symptoms, her sugar was fine and did not have keytones.\u00a0\u00a0She missed a lot of school, we went to the doctor several times, they did blood work and all kinds of tests but could not find anything wrong.\u00a0\u00a0Every time she would complain and I would keep her home or go pick her up from school, by the time we got to the doctor's office the pain was gone or subsiding.\u00a0\u00a0They suggested giving her antacids as they could not find anything wrong.\u00a0\u00a0The antacids didn't help.\u00a0\u00a0We started thinking it was all in her head or maybe she was doing it for attention.\u00a0\u00a0In reviewing her sugars, I noticed that whenever she was running high for more than 24 hours, (not high enough to cause keytones in Em but maybe in others)it seemed like when she came back down she would crash and have a bad low, then level out and that's when she would get the stomach pains, after her sugar was back to normal.\u00a0\u00a0That is the only thing we could pin point as a pre-cursor to the stomach aches.\u00a0\u00a0She's on a pump now and so far we haven't had this happen any more.\u00a0\u00a0I know that's not much help and I know how frustrated I was when this was going on with her.",

            "answer": "Some of this is redundant - I posted it on a different comment trail as well.Hello - I am the parent of a 9 y.o. with diabetes (originally said to be type 1 but now they are looking into MODY).\u00a0\u00a0Our daughter is not Celiac -She has a very high pain tolerance but has had intermitent bouts with stomach pain over the past year and a half - which is when her diabetes started.OUR pediatrician and endocrine both state that they \"don't think her stomach pain is related to her diabetes\" - I know it is - she NEVER had this pain especially this often before her diabetes.I can say that we have gotten to a point of nearly ZERO stomach aches and pains by either removing or significantly reducing her intake of dairy (milk and cheese), processed foods, high wheat foods and complex carbs (bread, pasta, white rice etc).\u00a0\u00a0We also increased her intake of fresh fruits, veggies and natural foods.\u00a0\u00a0And added a fiber supplement (benefiber) just to help her body with digestion and processing what she does eat.\u00a0\u00a0Her body did not have any problems diagesting the foods that she struggles with now before her diabetes.The pancreas has multiple functions in that it produces and secretes hormones (including insulin) and digestive enzymes necessary to break down carbs, protein and fat.I actually found this website just this evening looking for some type of study about the pancreas and its' other functions and how it could affect a person with insulin dependent diabetes.....We are 100% sure that this has helped our daughter - but I am determined to find a study or something to help substantiate our findings so that I can forward that information to other parents that deal with our same frustrations.It is such a powerless feeling to just watch my daughter in pain.\u00a0\u00a0We are new to diabetes (11 months) but we have always been a very nutritionally conscious family.By keeping her diet clean and simple - we have made a huge difference in our daughters stomach aches.If we all keep reaching out to one another and working toward gaining more knowledge and empowering ourselves - hopefully we can figure this out so that our children don't have to suffer......as\u00a0\u00a0KManis stated above - It is diffucult enough to see your child suffer with diabetes.",

            "answer": "Everything that you have said about Em is what we are experiencing with Lexie.\u00a0\u00a0She is 6 years old and was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes\u00a0\u00a01 1/2 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0Just a month ago she started complaining about stomach pain around her belly button.\u00a0\u00a0She only complains when she's really in pain.\u00a0\u00a0She also loves school and have been missing a lot of school because of the pain.\u00a0\u00a0At first it started out happening about every few days then it got more and more and now it was happening constantly.\u00a0\u00a0She said that she was always in pain but at times it would hurt very badly.\u00a0\u00a0It seemed to be morning and night and everytime she ate food.\u00a0\u00a0So she started not eating very much.\u00a0\u00a0She thin any way so she lost about 2 lbs over the past month.We took her to the pediatrician and they did an X ray of her stomach area and a blood test to test her pancrease to rule out pancreatitus.\u00a0\u00a0They also tested for bacteria in her stomach/blood stream.\u00a0\u00a0 All tests came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0He put her on Prevacid.So we kept track of her blood sugar, keytones and food eaten.\u00a0\u00a0I did this for a week and then called her Endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0I faxed them the log and they said that they didn't feel it was diabetes related and told us to go back to her pediatrician and have him do a Celiac test.We went back in to see her doctor and he took some more blood to do the Celiac test.\u00a0\u00a0While at the doctors she seemed in no pain.\u00a0\u00a0This happened all of the time.\u00a0\u00a0No one seemed to be witnessing the pain she gets in so it seemed that no one belives us.\u00a0\u00a0The pediatrician increased her Prevacid to 2 pills a day.\u00a0\u00a0I had tried Prevacid for a week now with no change in the pain.\u00a0\u00a0I tried Tums and Peptobismo.\u00a0\u00a0Neither helped the pain.\u00a0\u00a0I tried childrens Tylenol (doesn't help).\u00a0\u00a0I also tried Hydrocodone (she had this from when she broke her leg) and it didn't phase the pain and infact she said it made it worse.So when we were leaving her doctors after the blood test for the Celiac, she doubled over in pain.\u00a0\u00a0 She was getting in the car and had just shut the door and was screaming.\u00a0\u00a0I thought that she had shut her hand in the door.\u00a0\u00a0When she could finally talk she said it was her stomach.\u00a0\u00a0Of course I was panicking and was going to rush her to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0I thought it may be her appendix.\u00a0\u00a0It ended up subsiding so I took her home but she was very lathargic and wouldn't eat.\u00a0\u00a0We took her to the childrens hospital that night.They did a blood test and a CT Scan and tested for all kinds of things.\u00a0\u00a0All came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0While we were there the pain was gone.\u00a0\u00a0So all the doctors saw was a little girl with nothing wrong with her.\u00a0\u00a0It's been very frustrating.\u00a0\u00a0They ended up saying that her bowels were slightly impacted (but she was always having daily bowel movements).\u00a0\u00a0So they gave her an enima and sent us home.\u00a0\u00a0So we still have no answers after all of this.We started exploring the posibility that it was in her head and possibly stress related to school.\u00a0\u00a0Although we noted that over the holiday while she was out of school it continues to happen.\u00a0\u00a0So that kind of discounts that.\u00a0\u00a0Her blood sugar has been high for no reason.\u00a0\u00a0I'm going to start watching for it to go high then bottom out and then get normal and see if that is when the pain happens.\u00a0\u00a0She has had some keytones but not consistant.She's back at school and having less pain but she went through about 2 days of no pain and then it was back at one point.\u00a0\u00a0So I'm not confident that this is over.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing helps the pain at all.\u00a0\u00a0If we could just at least get her some relief from the pain, that would be better then nothing since no one can figure this out.\u00a0\u00a0It's bad enough that she has to got through shots and finger pricks but now stomach pain.\u00a0\u00a0What more could a 6 year old go through.\u00a0\u00a0I just am so frustrated and concerned.We feel so alone but reading everyone's emails make me feel slightly better.\u00a0\u00a0At least we are pretty sure that this ISN'T all in her head.\u00a0\u00a0What's hard is the lack of help we got from her diabetes team.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor is really, really good but very busy and didn't provide much help to us.\u00a0\u00a0I would think that he'd be familiar with the stomach pain related to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Reading all of this sounds like there are lots of people going through this.\u00a0\u00a0Surely someone has figured this out.Meanwhile, our tiny daughter is in pain and we are attempting to get her mind off of things and get her back in school so that she's not behind and left out of life with friends and class mates during the holidays.\u00a0\u00a0She seems to be a little better but what the heck caused all of this???!!!What I'm wondering is if this might have anything to do with her pancrease finally shutting down completely.\u00a0\u00a0We've been in the \"honeymoon\" period all this time and with the blood sugars going high for no reason, I'm wondering if possibly the stomach pain is related to the extrem highs then lows and the hights might be caused by her pancrease completely shutting down.\u00a0\u00a0We have started increasing the insulin over the past 2 weeks but are going slow since shes so young.\u00a0\u00a0Don't want an extreme low in the middle of the night.\u00a0\u00a0It's happened a few times and she hasn't woke up every time.I'm just frustrated that we're having to diagnose this all by ourselves.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck everyone who is going through this same thing.\u00a0\u00a0My heart goes out to you and your kids!",
