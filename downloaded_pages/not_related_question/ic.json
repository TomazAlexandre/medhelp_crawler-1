            "answer": "First of all your program do not sound all that off base from the norm.\u00a0\u00a0But aside from that if it is working for you that is what is important not the plan itself.Second, It is probably all of that swimming and exercise that allows you to get away with just using Lantus.\u00a0\u00a0All of that exercise will burn a lot of carbs.So adding strength training will probably use more carbs so lowering your dose of Lantus would be the correct thing to do.\u00a0\u00a0But in this case you might want to try to use the Actrapid to lower your highs instead as you are currently doing.You should be able to figure out what your carb/Actrapid ratio is pretty simply.\u00a0\u00a0Take a reading and then take a specific amount of Actrapid and wait for it to have its full effect and then take another reading.\u00a0\u00a0When you have that you will know the dosage for the carbs that you are adding and that should keep you close to normal.\u00a0\u00a0You will also need to know your carb/blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Ie If I eat 4 g of carbs my blood sugar goes up 20 points and I need 1 unit of Actrapid to lower it 20 points.\u00a0\u00a0You can get your carb/blood sugar ratio by taking a fixed amount of carbs (easiest way is with glucose tablets) and testing before and after to see the rise.Make absolutely sure that you are not adjusting the dosages of Lantus and Actrapid at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0This is a recipe for disaster and make sure any changes that you make are slow.\u00a0\u00a0Do not make huge adjustments or several adjustments at the same time.",

            "answer": "Your reply is just what I need, thank you.I know that the goal is in normal range glucose levels, I said it's diffrent because I've never seen anyone else take a dose beyond 20 units, that's all.And I will be taking it slowly of course.Thank you very much!",

            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It looks like you understand that Lantus isn\u2019t designed to cover all carbs, but to cover the glucose that your liver dumps out all day long, and that you need a faster acting insulin to cover the carbs you eat for meals.\u00a0\u00a0You\u2019re looking to figure out two ratios, the carb ratio and the correction factor.\u00a0\u00a0One is for carbs you eat, the other is for how much to dose for highs.This is a description of a way to figure the carb ratio:http://www.diabetesnet.com/diabetes_control_tips/carb_factor.phpIt uses the total daily dose to figure out how many grams one unit of insulin will cover.\u00a0\u00a0Then you can use that to figure out what to dose for the carbs you eat at a meal.The correction factor is similar:http://www.diabetesnet.com/diabetes_control_tips/corr_factor.phpWhen you start changing these, you may want to test more often for a couple days, to verify that you\u2019re not going too high or too low.\u00a0\u00a0Also give it 2 or 3 days before you make a change, sometimes your body takes that long to adjust.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

    "question": "Hello.I follow an insulin program, which may sound a little diffrent (reading all of the other questions).I'm 18 years old, weighing around 191 and standing 5'11\".I take about 60 units of Lantus daily, using the pen, and that's about it.I exercise a lot, swimming, so perhaps it is my high-insulin receptiveness that allows this amount of Lantus to cover ALL of my needs, I do take Actrapid (I hope you're familiar with it) when the glucose level gets high and I can use a little amount of it, but that is rare.My glucose levels are usually normal, unless I eat too much sweets or so.Now that you know what I do, I will present the problem.I am going to add strength training (weight lifting) to my swimming, and as of now I am counting protine, carbs and fats in everything I eat and logging it.By calculations, I am supposed to eat an enormous amount of food (most sources indicate about 3800 kcal), that means a lot of carbs, my Lantus won't be able to cover them.So, I am going to lower the lantus, and I want to take Actrapid before major meals, but how much?, I know how much carbs and all, but how can I translate that to an amount of Actrapid?I know all of you would recommend me seeing my doctor, but I'm stuck with one who is bad but the hospital gives me all my supplies for free (not even insurance), he actually prescribes insulin to me and makes a fuss when I change the dose, like it's an antibiotic or something, and he doesn't know a thing about sports.So please help me with the best of your experience ^_^",
