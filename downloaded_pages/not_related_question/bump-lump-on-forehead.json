            "answer": "Thank you for visiting the Family Practice Forum.Quite commonly people will develop sebaceous cysts on their head and neck. A sebaceous (or epidermoid) cyst is a noncancerous swelling under the skin. It is lined by packed outer skin cells. The cyst itself is filled with oil or dead cells.
