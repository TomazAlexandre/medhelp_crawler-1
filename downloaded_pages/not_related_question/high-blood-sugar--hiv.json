If you had eaten, even a definitely high blood sugar probably is meaningless (but this might explain the difference compared to a lower level 2 weeks earlier).\u00a0\u00a0In any case, this has nothing to do with HIV.The direct answers to your questions are 1) no, 2) no, 3) zero, and 4) no.Regards--\u00a0\u00a0HHH, MD",

    "question": "hi dr. i am a straight 29 male living in qatar. i had protected sex with a prostitute with an unknow HIV status. i didnt ejaculate and i was still turned on when i took out my penis so i removed the condom and started masturbating myself. my hands were still wet from the condom (with her fluids all over the condom), is there a possibility/risk that i culd have gotten it to myself as my fingers were wet from the condom when i started masturbating myself? i had a very small scratch on the top of my penis, can that be a way the hiv might have gotton through my body? I had a test 4 weeks later and it was \u2013ve. But 2 days ago I had my blood sugar tested and it was surprisingly high (still within the average), my question is:1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0can HIV affect the blood sugar and raise it (if its there)?2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 can the high blood sugar rate affect the accuracy of the test I did?3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 what is my risk factor?4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 do you recommend another test?thx",
