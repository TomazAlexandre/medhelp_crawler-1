            "answer": "Hi,First thing take a deep breath.\u00a0\u00a0As you well know your anxiety isn't helping anything.\u00a0\u00a0 You will need to make a conscious effort on managing it.It is also not recommended to stop taking your anxiety meds.\u00a0\u00a0You need to keep your anxiety under control so you can deal with other things in your life.Ideally you will get in to see a dr when you can and get properly checked.Blood sugar levels of 100 - 140 are NOT an emergency, and don't automatically make you diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Nor will you automatically progress to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You have time to deal with this.The way to manage possible diabetes with diet (and this should also help with your anxiety) is with low carb, high healthy fats, and moderate protein diet.\u00a0\u00a0This way of eating is similar to paleo, new atkins induction, ketogenic.I am actually diabetic and have to use insulin.\u00a0\u00a0I follow the ketogenic eating approach and my fats intake is about 80% of energy, protein is about 15% of energy, and carbs are about 5% of energy.\u00a0\u00a0With this approach my blood sugars are excellent and I have greatly reduced how much insulin I need to use.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the ketogenic way of eating I have also managed to slowly lose weight.Exercise daily.\u00a0\u00a0Find ways to manage your stress.Breakfast will ideally be protein and fat (not bagel, banana and peanut butter, which combined are nearly all carb).\u00a0\u00a0For example eggs fried in butter, some cheese, and some green veges.Lunch and dinner for me are typically some sort of fatty meat and plenty of non-starchy vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0My snacks are nuts, cheese, vegetables.Hope this is helpful for you.",

    "question": "I've had hypoglycemia symptoms\u00a0\u00a0for about 2-3 months unaware & when I found out I've had my sugar low for a long time I started checking my sugar & correcting it. But now from one day to another my sugar will NOT stabilize. I used to be between 70-90 now it goes from 47-198!I feel terrible all the time.I'm convinced I did this to myself \"accidentally\"I have a severe anxiety disorder so I'm always worried & nervous & have constant panic attacks throughout\u00a0\u00a0the day- I can't afford treatmentI have clinical depressionInsomnia& I'm an extremely picky eater& I stress eatI don't drink water because I don't get thirstyI think at first the stress & anxiety would make my sugar drop giving me nightmares & panic attacks.I first had a super low blood sugar 'Attack' on Black Friday night. I showed all the symptoms (before I knew what they were) but worse. My sugar was down to 47 & had had a SEVERE panic attack the night before I had one big one & then lots of small ones every 5 minutes that only last about 3-5 minutes.I was irritatedGrumpyAnxiousTiredShakyNauseasAnd all I wanted to do was sleep.My boyfriend made me check my sugar (his moms machine) & it was 47. They gave me some sweets & I perked right up. That night I did a lot of research & found out I've been probably been having hypo for about 2-3 months.3-4 days went by after my conclusion & I was taking care making sure I ate enough (I ate maybe once a day occasionally twice) & had emergency oj & candy around the house. I felt adventurous one night & decided to pig out on a burger & small fries w/oj at around 8-9pmI woke up drenched in sweat & panicking & had to check my sugar & it was the highest I'd ever seen it, 198.I had another panick attack because of it & probably spiked it even more.Now my sugar won't go down. The highest it's been while I was \"healthy\" was 97Last time I checked it was around June/August.Now I wake up with 114,118,171 but never past 198-yet2 hours fasting still high ish 108,119,121I've made a huge change in diet, it wasn't that bad to begin with all I eat is chicken, fruits, some veggies & drink tea. I don't really eat red meat or pork & I don't eat fishI eat fast food once a week when j see my boyfriend but it's usually chicken teriyaki, chipotle chicken bowls & sometimes tacos & club sandwiches.I LOVE potatoes & pastries -I know bad-But it's not everyday.Now I eat like half a whole grain bagel, with 1/4 banana & half a tablespoon of peanut butter with green tea & water for breakfast & my sugar is still too high. It's only been since Friday night/Saturday morning since my sugar has spiked & today is Tuesday.I can't afford any medical treatment whatsoever, not even medical or Medicaid. I don't know What's going on I've had stress & panic attacks since then. I can't eat I'm nauseas all the time & I'm really really scared.I've been going on walks everyday since then 30 min, an hour & today for about 3-4 hours & I just always feel horrible.Whenever I work out my sugar spikes & I don't know how to bring it down & it gives me anxiety which only makes it worse. If I don't work out its still high.I've stayed between 70-90 fasting& maybe 90-100 after food.I'm an avid hiker & amateur rock climber. I've played sports all my life & I've been a camp Counsler since 2009. I try to stay active as possible despite my weight. I've always been chunky around 250-260lbs as an adultNow I'm down to 241I was 247 last weekI'm only 22& I've never been this messed up in life & I'm terribly terribly scared.I'm obsessing over this & I'm making myself sicker.\u00a0\u00a0My boyfriend tells me not to worry because 100-140 aren't bad, but I don't want it to go past 100 because I'm terrified of becoming diabetic.I'm eating & working out as if I already were diabetic but I'm just miserable, sad, hungry & sick. It's made my depression worse & I've had to stop taking all my Meds because they all lower my sugar or might make me insulin resistant.",
