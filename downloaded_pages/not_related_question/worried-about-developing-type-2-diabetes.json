            "answer": "Good you want supplements that'll keep your sugars regular take cinnamon, biotin, chromium and the list goes on. Walmart sells a diabetes health pack supplement and it has every vitamin that'll help regulate your sugars. You can do it in the diabetes section. Also the only way to know is to get your A1C tested with your doctor. Only then will you know if you have pre-diabetes. Also try to go to bed around 8 or 9pm and don't eat 2 hours before bed. If you get hungry drink two 8oz glasses of water with lemon it'll fill you. It's also good to add a shot of apple cider vinager to the water and lemon. Helps your liver from dumping to much sugar at night and you will notice a difference after a week or two in your energy in the morning. You have to do this religiously though. Make it part of your nightly routine.",

            "answer": "My advice is to take metformin. It sure is the miracle medicine. And it is very cheap although you need prescription. Also avoid processed food and refined wheat and rice. Eat as less sugar as possible. Exercise is good but don't do any when your level of glucose is already high.Your first step should be getting a glucose monitor.",

    "question": "I was prediabetic 10 months ago. And I have been walking for 60-90 minutes daily and sometimes body weight exercises.\u00a0\u00a0Now the way I feel like tired in morning and through out the day (first day today August 30) I am concerned I might have this disorder because I started to eat sugary foods for few days in last week at night like mangoes, bananas milk, dark and milk chocolate and worst of all, I ate KFC chocolate cookie which I hate most.. If I can't sleep I start eating at nightHow can I reverse this I know some say its impossible. From this website and doctor say that fasting can help reverse this condition by burning off excess sugar.\u00a0\u00a0It does make sense. Is this legitimate.\u00a0\u00a0And there are certain supplements like Alpha Lipoic Acid, Chromium Pliconate, Magnesium, etc. I have NOW MagnesiumAlso I used like to carry groceries from shop to my car and from car to my home. I find it hard to do that as well.I don't know what should I do.",
