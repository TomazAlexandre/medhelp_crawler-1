I had gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and didn't know until the last baby that I had a low cervix. So I was given hormone shots and finally carried a baby to term. I'm so sorry for what you're going through. I had a D&C, DNC, whichever. To bring baby out.... I even gave birth to my only full term child 2 years after, but i still think about the \"missed\" miscarriage. I'm so sorry I can imagine but I can't imagine.",
