            "answer": "The high TSH is HYPOthyroidism -- so if you were initially HYPER, then the TSH would have been low.\u00a0\u00a0In many cases of patients going hyper to hypo -- this is a transient thyroiditis -- where there can be a full recovery to normal without medications.\u00a0\u00a0Treatment T4 (levothyroxine) is sometimes used to help people recover during the hypo phase then the medication is weaned off after 4-6 months and the situation re-evaluated.\u00a0\u00a0It really depends on the trend of thyroid levels and the symptoms in terms of treating vs. observation.",

    "question": "Recently I have been bombarded with health issues. After I had my son 2.5 years ago, the gestational diabetes didn't go away right away and my doctor says I am prediabetic. On top of that, I recently was bombarded with the symptoms of hyperthyroidism which was causing some significant health issues and disrupting my life. After bloodwork we discovered my TSH levels were very high but my T3 and T4 were normal. A week after that I was in Urgent care with abdominal pain, leading to an ultrasound, leading to a diagnosis of polycystic ovary, which Iwas told can cause hormal imbalances as well as my prediabetic state. I was sent to an endocrinologist, who did bloodwork and then told me, I'm not hyperthyroid anymore, I'm hypOthyroid now, and that he just jumped to putting me on medication without investigating why I made such a leap from one extreme to the other. He cancelled my scan (the one where I have to take a pill and be scanned). He also seems unconcerned with the PCOS because I've had two children without fertility treatment, but isn't that a big factor in thyroid and hormonal imbalances?I haven't taken the meds, the side effects and long term damage of the medication, just seems to be worse than the symptoms I am already suffereing... plus if I am bouncing from hyper to hypo, what if I change and I'm n the wrong med... that could be an issue?Help!",
