            "answer": "Hi,as already mentioned, the answer to your question is different for every person.When I started on insulin, my doctor gave me a starting ratio of 1 unit of insulin for 15 g of carbs and I then adjusted from there.\u00a0\u00a0Adjustment was then done in combination with close monitoring of blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Ie. I test blood sugar before eating, lets say it is 100.\u00a0\u00a0I then eat 45 g of carbs and inject 3 units of insulin before the meal. Test 2 hours after starting to eat and my blood sugar is 140 (my target is < 120 after eating).\u00a0\u00a0This tells me that the insulin was not enough.\u00a0\u00a0Next time I eat 45 g of carbs I will try 4 units of insulin).\u00a0\u00a0I actually finally worked out that I need 1 unit of insulin for about 10 g of carbs.It also helps to restrict carbs.\u00a0\u00a0I typically eat few carbs - mainly vegetables - and only need to inject 1 or 2 units of insulin per meal.Ideally your doctor would refer you a diabetes educator who can help you with this.The following books are also good references \"Using Insulin\" by John Walsh, or \"Think like a Pancreas', both of which explain how to work out carb:Insulin dosing.",
