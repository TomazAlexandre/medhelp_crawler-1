            "answer": "Atropine would be of no help and could be harmful. Neither is 7-MA.\u00a0\u00a0These are possibly helpful in very young patients to slow myopia.\u00a0\u00a0Not helpful for adult, middle age, older myopia.\u00a0\u00a0Whether to take estrogen or not should be based on general medical considerations and not influenced one way or another by the eye problem. No evidence it would help at all.\u00a0\u00a0Macular health is furthered by excellent diet: fruits vegetables fiber fish berries nuts. Lots of lutein containing foods (google lists of those with high lutein content), avoiding any nicotine or cannibis products direct or second hand, heavy sunlight exposure is bad, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, high blood fats (cholesterol and triglycerides) bad.",

    "question": "I am a 41-year-old female with degenerative myopia (-10L/-12R), including a lacquer crack in the L eye and and one episode of CVN in the L eye (treated with two shots of Lucentis). I am aware that there is effectively nothing that one can do to stop this condition progressing (equally I believe that rates of progression can be variable), but obviously I am desperate to try and boost the health of my eye as much as possible and to that end am taking an AREDS2 supplement and trying to eat an anti-inflammatory diet. I was wondering what other patients take in terms of supplements or meds, and if anyone thinks there might be any benefit to an adult of taking 7-methylxanthine and/or atropine? Does anyone think that women might benefit from trying to reduce oestrogen, given the higher incidence of the condition in women, the presence of hormone receptors in the eye etc.? Clutching at straws here, I expect, but I am newly diagnosed and very nervous about the future - something that I expect many fellow sufferers can relate to! Thanks in anticipation.",
