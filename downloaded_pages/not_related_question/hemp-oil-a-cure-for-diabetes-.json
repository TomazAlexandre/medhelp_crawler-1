            "answer": "www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov.If you use the above website to search for things like \"endocannabinoid system + diabetes\" or even \"cannabis + diabetes\" you will find a LOT of information. That is your \"3rd fact\". The problem is people just need to do the research. A lot of the conclusions in the studies on the above website are that cannabinoid-based therapies are where it's at in regards to diabetes. They suggest that receptors in our brain that specifically \"light up\" when cannabinoids are introduced are WHAT must be targeted for a cure for diabetes. It's science.",

            "answer": "WaveRider, you aren't going to find that as long as cannabis is federally illegal. Sad fact. That doesn't mean it isn't a cure; science has all but proved as much as they could short of the human clinical trials they won't be allowed to do. It all comes back to the fact that pharmaceutical industries make too much money to ever let a plant become a cure-all for any disease.
