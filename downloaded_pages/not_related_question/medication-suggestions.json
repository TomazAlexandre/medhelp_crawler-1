            "answer": "Hi,It is really sad that you are going through a lot of\u00a0\u00a0pain and agony . You can take Lyrica for the treatment of Fibromyalgia and Diabetic neuropathy. But the adverse reactions of the drug should be considered before using it .The recommended dose of LYRICA for fibromyalgia is. 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day) and may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day). Because LYRICA is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, the dose should be adjusted for patients with reduced renal function (creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min . The adverse effects of Lyrica are - dizziness, drowsiness ,visual disturbance (including blurred vision, diplopia), ataxia, dysarthria, tremor, lethargy, memory impairment, euphoria, constipation, dry mouth, peripheral edema, loss or decrease of libido, erectile dysfunction, weight gain , depression, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, myoclonus, hypoaesthesia, hyperaesthesia, hypomnesia, tachycardia, paramnesia, excessive salivation, sweating, flushing, rash, muscle cramp, myalgia, arthralgia, urinary incontinence, dysuria, thrombocytopenia, kidney calculus\u00a0\u00a0and rarely\u00a0\u00a0neutropenia, first degree heart block, hypotension, hypertension, pancreatitis, dysphagia, oliguria, rhabdomyolysis .Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA's), including amitriptyline and doxepin, are effective in treating multiple FM symptoms including pain, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and depression. Serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (Fluoxetine, Seratiline) are better tolerated and provide greater benefits on depressed mood\u00a0\u00a0and sleep disturbance than TCA's. Tramadol has been shown in several trials to reduce pain . Apart from addressing the depression and pain, it is also important to minimize fatigue by promoting a healthy sleep regimen. This may involve simple behavioral strategies such as going to bed and getting up at the same time every day, making sure that the sleeping environment is conducive to sleep (e.g., a comfortable bed and room temperature), avoiding caffeine, or medications (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone) to promote restful sleep. Yoga, relaxation exercises, breathing techniques, nutritional supplements may help . Of these, exercise is shown to improve fitness, self-assessment of improvement, and reduce tender point counts . Please consult a physician for further consultation . Hope this helps you . Take care and regards !",

            "answer": "Hello, I am a 31 year old mother of two. I have had some complications since early on in life that were always said to just be depression. However, I feel like I am deteriorating physically. For the past 7 years they have thought that I had tendonitis, then Carpal Tunnel but I did the nerve test and the intramuscular test and that checks out fine. So, they give me cortisone in both wrists and it made my hands WAY worse. I have constant fatigue. My head hurts when I laugh. My neck and shoulders are always in pain, my legs and feet are so sore after a walk, or even shopping that I have difficulty walking after and for several days after as well.I can't do anything physical without paying for it later for days after with the exception of pilates buns and thighs work out. I can't hold a job now or ever before! I end up leaving to not be fired for attendance issues because of this crud whatever it is. I also have this awful unbalanced feeling in my head that comes and goes several times a day.I do take effexor XR but I've taken it for the past 3 years and haven't had any of this head stuff til recently.I was in PT for 3 months and found out that I have a rotated C3. MS is in my family tree, I have 2 cousins that are brother and sister and they both were Dx'd the same year.The pain in my hands all the way to my neck is the absolute worst and theres nothing that relieves it and rubbing it makes it hurt and the area becomes very red. Any ideas what could be wrong or where I can look to do my own research??Thank You",

            "answer": "Please ask your doctor to run blood tests for celiac disease. It is STRONGLY linked to every single one of your ailments. That doesn't mean that it's a sure thing that it's causing all your symptoms, but it's so very likely that you really should rule it out.In fact, if I were you, even if the celiac panel is negative, I'd try a gluten-free\u00a0\u00a0diet for a good 2-4 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Every celiac disease forum is jam-packed with people with your symptoms (and the same diagnoses of fibro, diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease, reflux, etc) whose symptoms were ENTIRELY caused by gluten. Some even had negative blood tests--the tests are not perfect.My endocrinologist is now screening all diabetic and thyroid patients for celiac disease/gluten intolerance.\u00a0\u00a0While the gluten-free diet is NOT a cure for\u00a0\u00a0diabetes--you will still need to be very careful about your sugars, and may still need insulin--it is very beneficial.\u00a0\u00a0For those with celiac AND diabetes, the gluten is more of a direct problem than the carbs.It's great to have medications like Lyrica available--but it's a far better thing to find the underlying cause of the symptoms in the first place.Celiac disease is the easiest and cheapest disease in the world to manage--no drugs to take, nothing to buy, you don't even have to buy special gluten-free foods if you don't want to--just eat naturally gluten-free foods like rice, potatoes, fresh fruits, veggies, salads (no croutons), meat, fish, eggs, etc.",

            "answer": "I just wanted to let your know that I was taking LYRICA which was prescribed by my Doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I was waiting anxiously when I heard this medication was very helpful for fibromyalgia patients, and coming to Canada.To my dismay I had all the side effects mentioned for this medication and was told by my doctor to stop taking it.Like Doctor Rajgopal mentioned about medications, I was given amitriptyline which helps me have a good night sleep and I feel more refreshed when I wake up.\u00a0\u00a0I don't take them during the day because my body seems to absorb the medication so well that I feel I am in la-la land.\u00a0\u00a0Life has to go on so I made a choice to take my medications at night.Try to get in some quality time for yourself.\u00a0\u00a0One needs to relax and prevent your muscle to spams because of the stress.\u00a0\u00a0Medication, warm baths, soft music, candle light can be very relaxing.\u00a0\u00a0If you have children, let them know you want some time to yourself.I am not a dcotor, but I have read that Alzheimer's is not a combination illness of fibromyalgia.I hope this will help.\u00a0\u00a0I am a fibro patient also.",

    "question": "I have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, acid reflux, diverticulosis, diabetes and fibromyalgia syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0Had FMS for a very long time, probably most of my adult life.\u00a0\u00a0Diagnosed with hypothyroid condition about 12 years ago, and with diabetes was about 3 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I am on Armour Thyroid, 2 gr. per day; Aciphex 1 a day, both in the morning; then I take Metformin at night, started with 1, then 2, and now am being bumped to 3 a day.\u00a0\u00a0I have a very difficult time sleeping through the night.Is there anything I can safely take to help me sleep through the night?\u00a0\u00a0I have pain in the usual FMS sites, concentrated in my upper back, neck and legs; I get that restless leg \"itchy\" feeling at night sometimes, and I occasionally take Flexeril and Vicodin to help with the muscle pain.\u00a0\u00a0I try to limit those to two or three times per week, to avoid becoming addicted.\u00a0\u00a0I rarely dream.\u00a0\u00a0I wake up typically 2 to 4 times per night, usually have to use the bathroom when I do, then go back to bed, usually able to return to sleep, but again, I do NOT typically enter REM sleep (dream).\u00a0\u00a0Is Lyrica safe to take for the other conditions I have, and if so, what are the side effects and dangers?\u00a0\u00a0I do also have an allergy to pennicillin and a few grasses, trees, foods, etc.Any suggestions as to what I can try next for sleep?\u00a0\u00a0I am afraid that if I don't get some good sleep soon, it will make me dangerous on the road.\u00a0\u00a0I work full time as a legal secretary, and the fibro-fog is getting worse as time goes on.\u00a0\u00a0I am thinking that better sleep might help with that.\u00a0\u00a0Do I need to be screened for Alzheimer's?Thanks!",
