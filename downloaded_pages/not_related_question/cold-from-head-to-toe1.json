            "answer": "Hi,You may have some diabetic neuropathy but it is quite difficut to tell just based on your reported symptoms. The best way to diagnose this is by a nerve conduction study, so speak with your doctor about this.Another important concern would be poor circulation which is quite common in persons with diabetes, and can also be diagnosed with some simple tests.Definitely follow up on the Toxopasmosis testing.Also discuss a referral to a neurologist who can help determine several of these possibilties, and others that they would be mote aware of then I.Good luck and take care.",

    "question": "grandma2be, Feb 22, 2008 09:49PMHi, I hope someone can help me.\u00a0\u00a0For 10 days now\u00a0\u00a0I've been experiencing coldness which started from my feet-ankles-legs- thighs, then traveled to buttocks arms --face--head --mouth-ears and nose. I have been having sharp, burning pain in feet. (Thats where the pain started)\u00a0\u00a0I only have pain in feet. I went to see my doctor: she gave me blood tests--A1C\u00a0\u00a06.8,\u00a0\u00a0THyroid\u00a0\u00a0normal, and Toxoplasmosis test did come in yet. I have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. My cat has Toxoplasmosis and is being treated for it. Do you think I have Diabetes Neuropathy?\u00a0\u00a0Doctor isn't sure yet. I at times breakout in sweats ( sugar is at good Range).\u00a0\u00a0My body Temp was 96.4 for a little while, then went up to 97.7, it does go up to 98.6.\u00a0\u00a0Even my tongue gets cold. The coldness is causing me to sneeze alot and loose sleep. I am scared. If my body is cold, does it mean that it's loosing oxygen?\u00a0\u00a0Circulation?\u00a0\u00a0I have had nerve damage before from surgery in both feet. And I have 2 herniated disk and a cervical buldging\u00a0\u00a0disk. ( Due to a fall.).\u00a0\u00a0I can feel my feet, no numbness now. Prior to them becoming cold they did at times feel numb in certain spots. i have to sleep sitting up or I will get colder. My doctor doesn't think that I should go to the ER.Thank youfrom grandma2be",
