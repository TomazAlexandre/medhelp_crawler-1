            "answer": "It is not likley that this would be a normal pregnancy especially with the drop down the HCG of 26. Your doctor would need to follow you closely to make sure that the HCG does drop down to <2 and follow up with an ultrasound.I suggest that you see a doctor who specializes in recurrent pregnancy loss.The following is some general information from my website:Recurrent pregnancy loss can be attributed to many different causes. These causes include: genetic factors (e.g. abnormal fetal chromosomes, abnormal parental chromosomes); anatomic factors (e.g. structural abnormalities of the uterus such as scar tissue in the uterus, or congenital abnormalities of the uterus such as septate uterus); metabolic factors (e.g. diabetes); endocrine factors (e.g. abnormal thyroid, PCOS, diminished ovarian reserve); infectious factors (e.g. chlamydia, mycoplasma, ureaplasma); thrombotic factors (e.g. inherited thrombophilias); immunologic factors (e.g. anticardiolipin antibodies, autoimmune disorders, increased natural killer cell activity); male factors (e.g. sperm DNA fragmentation); and environmental factors (e.g. exposure to environmental toxins).I wish you wellness.",

    "question": "I am 36 years old and am G4P1.\u00a0\u00a0We had a daughter in 2005 with no problems.\u00a0\u00a0This year I had a miscarriage in March- I was 13 weeks but fetus only 9 wks.\u00a0\u00a0Then in September miscarriage #2 at 8 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I had a d&c for the first and the second was spontaneous.\u00a0\u00a0 My doc tested for antiphospholipid antibody and lupus anticoagulant and both were negative.\u00a0\u00a0Now I am again pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0My LNMP was Oct 22.\u00a0\u00a0I \"knew\" I was pregnant before I missed my period (my cycle is 26 - 28\u00a0\u00a0days so we did an HCG on Nov 16.\u00a0\u00a0It was 26 ( 3 wk4days).\u00a0\u00a0Doc said was low so repeated:November 20- HCG 108 (4wk 1d)November 22-HCG 75 (4wk 3d)November 24-HCG 26 (4wk 5d)So he said another miscarriage- call me next pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0(We had started prometrium 200 mg po QD and low dose ASA on November 19th when we got the first results.)I was a little unhappy with lack of follow up so saw my family doc and did another HCG onNovember 28 -141.\u00a0\u00a0So now it has gone up.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering- mostly out of desperation if there is any chance this is a viable pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Doc says HCG can wobble until miscarriage happens- but to keep taking my vitamin \"in case\".\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned could be tubal- but she says cannot tell on ultrasound yet with these low levels.\u00a0\u00a0I have no bleeding, no cramping, only symptom is breast tenderness (could be from the prometrium).\u00a0\u00a0We are going to do an U/S around 8 weeks but she said no more bloodwork for now unless pain and or bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0Can an hcg drop and then climb and be viable when done so early?\u00a0\u00a0What other testing should I have done now considering this is 3 losses in one year?\u00a0\u00a0I am on waiting lists for 2 fertility clinics- but I live in Canada and wait will be about 9 months and time is not on my side with my age.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your response.",
