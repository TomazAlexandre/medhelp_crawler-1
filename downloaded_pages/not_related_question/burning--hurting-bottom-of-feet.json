            "answer": "I wonder and do TOO much time on computer looking and looking for info. I've had so many illnesses since 18. (now 57) fibro pure mystery and (Hell) then....I'm on disability with things.I read already Metformin can depelete B12. I've read B12 can cause some of these symptoms. Drs. say not, (what else is new?!!) she wants me on new Lyrica for fibro (I'm on Prozac and Klonopin for many many yrs and can't get off!).\u00a0\u00a0From what I read on computer burning nerupoptahy burns at night too, I've been \"down\" with terrible cold going arond for a week, if I'm OFF feet, or lying, sitting, no burning and hurting on bottom of feet, (also for yrs. legs pains when on, I do get cortisone shots for spinal decompression; much worse since I had to quit my sitting state job). My foot dr. says can be neuropathy/fibromyalgia/facitis (excuse spelling) where esp. sore, Prednisone (he would not give cortisone shot to me) did not help. Isn't neuropathy pain and burning when NOT on feet too? Do you know for sure? right now terrible cold- been off feet(so ok) (bronchities going around) for a week!!! I'm planning of splurging on either Trivolta products (advertised on TV; Christian shows, many products) OR have books on ($168 a mo.) supplements for fibromyalgia, by Dr Murphree (great book; I've read them all for 30 yrs!) very expensive $168 a mo. but I must get better. I have twin grandbabies and I am only relative to babysit and I'm always sick....always had Sensitive nerves. Did you do any studying in any of these areas. Stress always makes me WORSE. Blessing for your input.....thanks. Lynn 22 (PA). )os. hair coming out for months)...stress? Blessings!",

            "answer": "As far as I know, neuropathy causes pain and stinging and it doesn't matter what time of day or what position you are in.\u00a0\u00a0 If the pain goes away when you are OFF your feet than you might be looking at something else.Cortisone is VERY bad for you.\u00a0\u00a0It also will mess with your blood sugars so try to stay away from it at all costs.Prednisone causes so many side effects that I wonder if it is even worth it for a person to take it unless it is absolutely a life-threatening situation!\u00a0\u00a0I have not heard of Trivolta products or Dr. Murphree but will research them.\u00a0\u00a0St. Johns Wort is holistic supplement for depression that has shown some promise for the treatment of FM but since you are taking Prozac and Klonopin - I don't recommend you trying it - it is contraindicating of the others and will make you very ill.\u00a0\u00a0You would need to get off them first for atleast 2-3 months.\u00a0\u00a0Stress makes everything worse for me as well.How did you go about getting disability?\u00a0\u00a0I have been sick for over 5-6 years and I have tried several times to work at a normal sit down at desk office job - 8-5 but I end up having to take too much time off due to my \"flare ups\" and the depression and anxiety that go with them.Blessing to you - Keep the Faith.Hope is all we have some days - right?",

            "answer": "Am Type 2 for several years, numbers good, but have foot pain also, mostly at night until lately. I stood for 2 days in a row to cut out patterns.\u00a0\u00a0Ended up with the left foot hurting and it does not let up , especially if i stand on it again. Tested negative for Neuropathy so can't account for this. This feels almost like the whole bottom of my foot is bruised.\u00a0\u00a0If I soak it in hot water, is better until the next time I stand again. So far i haven't seen a Dr. as had assumed this would eventually stop on its own.I do have Fibro also.PJ",

            "answer": "hello,what do you mean by your numbers are fine.\u00a0\u00a0What are your typical numbers?\u00a0\u00a0What is your hba1c?As Hba1c rises above 5.0, then the risk of diabetic complications (including neuropathy and muscle damage) starts going up.Non-diabetic numbers, typically fasting is < 95 (ideally in the 80s) and post eating < 120 (ideally close to fasting) would be the best way to reverse what sounds like possible neuropathy.If your numbers are higher then the best approach would be to normalize numbers.\u00a0\u00a0This is best done with low carb diet, and medications as required.Have you seen a podiatrist?\u00a0\u00a0 I think you may need to see a specialist to see what the problem really is.\u00a0\u00a0 Seems your Dr doesn't know.Do you have fibromyalgia issues in other areas than your feet?\u00a0\u00a0As far as I know fibromyalgia is typically systemic (ie. affects your whole body), not just your feet.Be careful with prednisone.\u00a0\u00a0Steroids can greatly elevate blood sugars, and if your problem is neuropathy will exacerbate it.Anyway, this is an old post.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed diabtetic less than a yr. ago. I take 2 75mg. Metformin a day. I eat realiviely health for a diabetic.for months the bottom of my feet, esp. the right one, hurt to walk on, are sore, and burn. I've been several times to a foot doctor, I've gotten recommeneded shoe insoles (not expensive) I've tried predisone. Nothing seems to help. Right foot is worst! He says it could be all three; my fibromyalgia, diabetes, and fibromyalgia. It is hindering my life in walking and even in hurting when not on. Can it be anything else.? What can I do for it? sometimes hurting and sometimes burning (alittle on other foot). It really impairs me. I test my numbers daily and they are fine...Help, please, it makes me miserable.",
