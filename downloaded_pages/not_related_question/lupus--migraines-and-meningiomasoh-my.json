Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.AV nicking can also be seen as a sign of hypertension (high blood pressure).\u00a0\u00a0I'm not aware of a neurological condition with av nicking, however would recommend having yearly eye examinations.Sorry that I can't offer you more information.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps, asking your ophthalmologist for other causes or placing this question in the Ophthalmology forum.Good luck.",

LOL.\u00a0\u00a0There was concern for vasculitis (from the lupus).Thank you for the information.\u00a0\u00a0.",

    "question": "I have had lupus for 12 years and migraines for longer than that.\u00a0\u00a0They found 2 meningiomas in the frontal lobe last year on an MRI.\u00a0\u00a0I was worked up for MS and, thankfully, do not have that added to my list of illnesses.\u00a0\u00a0I run a very low blood sugar and my ophthalmologist saw AV nicking.\u00a0\u00a0I had a 3-hour glucose tolerance test a few months back and the outcome was 44.\u00a0\u00a0He suggested I get another MRI and see a neurologist regarding the migraines, meningiomas, etc. I was wondering if the AV nicking could be part of a problem in a neurologic matter or perhaps possibly vasculitis...or what I have heard as \"pre diabetes\", although 2 of my doctors differ that there is even a \"pre diabetes\".Thanks for any info.",
