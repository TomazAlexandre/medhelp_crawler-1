            "answer": "Welcome to the STD forum.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for re-posting your question within the word/character limit.If I understand correctly, you have never had sex other than oral; there are other typical explanations for your symptoms, at least most of the time, i.e. recurrent yeast infections (which can be a parrticular problem in people with diabetes, especially if the blood glucose is not well controlled) and eczema; several health care providers have assured you that herpes isn't the problem; and at least one of those providers is a dermatologist, who a) would definitely recommend herpes and would know how to diagnose it and b) would not misdiagnose eczema.Beyond all that evidence, your symptoms do not suggest HSV is the cause.\u00a0\u00a0Herpes cannot cause such continuous symptoms like you described.\u00a0\u00a0And after the first few weeks, herpes outbreaks are always limited to a small patch of recurrent blisters sores.\u00a0\u00a0This patch is rarely more than an inch in diameter; always recurs in more or less the same spot, within in inch or so; always occurs on one side of the body, not both sides (e.g., one labia or the other, not both); each outbreak lasts only 7-10 days; happens no more often than every 4-6 weeks; and between those outbreaks, there are no symptoms at all.\u00a0\u00a0Further, genital herpes due to HSV-1 usually doesn't recur more often than once or twice a year.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, herpes is rarely transmitted by the indirect sorts of sexual exposure you describe.To the specific question:1) Late appearence of HSV-1 from years before?\u00a0\u00a0Extremely unlikely.2) Stress may or may not increase the frequency of recurrent outbreaks of herpes, but it\u00a0\u00a0probably doesn't make an outbreak appear after years of infection.3) Auto-inoculation of a new body site is rare, and typically occurs only during the initial infection -- not years later.4) Almost certainly your problem has nothing to do with any sex partner.5) Your symptoms don't suggest HSV-2 any more than HSV-1.\u00a0\u00a0 You can believe the blood test results.6) I have never seen a patient with the problems you describe in whom it turned out herpes was the cause.7) Presumably you have a primary care internist or family medicine doc who manages your diabetes. Make sure your diabetes is in excellent control; and follow his or her advice about whether to also continue care with your dermatologist, gynecologist, or both.\u00a0\u00a0If you are uncertain any of these people are not on top of the cause of your problem or if their treatments aren't helping, ask for a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0But in the meantime, please stop worrying about herpes.\u00a0\u00a0Almost certainly it is not the problem here.\u00a0\u00a0Your health problems are entirely unrelated to your current or past sexual partnerships.Happy New Year and good luck--\u00a0\u00a0HHH, MD",

            "answer": "Thanks very much for this help and guidance. Since I have thought myself pre-diabetic, havent been diligent in getting a primary care physician in my new city. Will follow up on that.To clarify, my sexual contact has mainly been limited to oral, but this summer dated a guy with skin to skin contact. For a brief moment he tried on two occasions to penetrate, but I stopped him-two ways- I am very small and he realized I was indeed a virgin. Because of the tightness, this brief contact did cause trauma and bleeding. This action, along with the other oral contact years before, and how similarly the sores looked to what I see online, and the first docs diagnosis, are what created my questioning. That\u00a0\u00a0contact was in June or early July.So am wondering if I could have multiple things going on- yeast and hsv 1 transmission to this area? As stated we both were neg for hsv 2, doc didnt test him for hsv 1,, and I knew I had it already? Ive read on this site that hsv 1 is harder to transmit genitally to genitally if you are already a hsv1 carrier? Do you mind addressing these questions and explaining please.Thank you again for the most helpful advice above. I will do as you say and follow up on deiabetes.Thank you.",

            "answer": "Your multiple symptoms make your situation quite complex, and you probably do indeed \"have multiple things going on\".\u00a0\u00a0I cannot guarantee herpes is not among them, but I doubt it.Here is a thread that describes genital HSV-1 in come detail.\u00a0\u00a0It should answer your remaining questions.http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/969931",

    "question": "Hello Doctor,Thanks for your help.Ive had four partners, no penetration with any, last oral sex was over six years ago. Had few oral encounters (probably less than seven) and the last relationships I had were all kept to masturbation, though we did have very brief skin to skin contact.Have been diagnosed with yeast infections,\u00a0\u00a0diabetic issues. Also, five years ago bloodwork showed positive with hsv 1. Had canker sores.About a montha and a half ago, was suffering from what I thought was another yeast infection and ran intensely with a tampon.. Tampon came partially out and irritated the skin while running. Later I looked at the area and saw white bumps where the tampon had been rubbing. I was concerned and called the two guys I had been with. We were all tested for hsv 2 and came out neg, doc didnt test for hsv 1. Doc did a visual and smelling exam of me and said herpes 1 or chancroid and sent me on my way with anitibiotic and herpes med.The next week I saw a gyno, he said he thot it unlikely hsv 1, but there was nothing left to test.He took me off meds. The next week I noticed small sores on arms, hands and face. Also, was sick with cold/sore throat and had blisters in throat.Saw a dermatologist and she thought the sores were eczema.A month and a half later, still itching, no pain, tested positive for yeast infection.Here are questionsHow likely is it that hsv 1 could show up this many years after oral sexDoc said it could be latent and just show up from stress and the running?How likely is it that hsv 1 could be transmitted via my hands while masturbating since I have eczemaHow likely is it that I could have hsv 1 from these guys now transmitted from our contactHow likely is it that the blood tests could be wrong and I now have hsv 2Have you seen sores that occur from yeast infections and abrasions that look like herpesWould you reccomend I find a gynecologist or proceed with follow up at dermatologistThank you!",
