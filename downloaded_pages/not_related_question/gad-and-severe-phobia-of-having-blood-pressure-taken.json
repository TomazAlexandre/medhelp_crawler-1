            "answer": "It must be difficult suffering from the anxiety and phobia that you report. I recommend that you discuss your concerns with your family physician, and request for his/her help in facilitating your referral to a psychiatrist. Phobias and other anxiety disorders are treatable with a combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy and medications. If Xanax makes you feel groggy, the dose may be decreased to half a tablet (0.125 mg), or other less sedating medications tried (e.g. Zoloft, Celexa, Prozac, etc).",

            "answer": "Hi, I had the same problem with blood pressure, furiouslyracing heartbeat and other anxieties before having my bloodpressure taken. I was put on a very low dose of Inderal,only 10 milligrams 3 times per day, I think, and it workedwonders, not only for that, but for calming the racing heartbeatwhich always occured before any other situation in which Imight be observed, or evaluated. I think most people who havereal high blood pressure take at least 80 mg per day, andsome alot more for migraines and other things. All I cansay is that very low dose of Inderal helped more than I everbelieved possible, and my blood pressure readings have beennormal ever since. Best of Luck and Hang in there.",

    "question": "I am a 51 yr. old female. I've had anxiety problems for many years but never knew what it was. My doctor said I have White Coat Syndrome after I had a terrible reaction to blood pressure medication, my blood pressure went so low I thought I was dying. It was terrifying. I began having severe panic attacks and he referred me to a therapist.\u00a0\u00a0After 4 yrs., I don't have full blown panic attacks but I still have anxiety problems and I have a severe phobia of having my blood pressure taken. Two years ago, I moved across the country and had to change my therapist.\u00a0\u00a0I stopped therapy about six months ago as he retired and I didn't think I was making much progress with him anyway. I avoid doctors and nurses, even socially and am constantly scared of getting sick and needing to go to a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0The first thing they do is take my blood pressure and it is always high because I am so panicked.\u00a0\u00a0I used to be able to monitor it at home (it was always normal) but I can't even do that now - it is too scary.\u00a0\u00a0I'm constantly worrying about \"what if I really have hypertension, diabetes, or whatever disease\". This is very embarrassing and I hate feeling so intimidated by doctors. I never had trouble going to doctors before this and I am not afraid of any ohter medical treatment, just the blood pressure thing. How can I find a medical doctor who will be understanding about this and a therapist who can help me? I take Xanax .25 for anxiety as needed but I hate the groggy feeling even though I'm grateful that it helps.",
