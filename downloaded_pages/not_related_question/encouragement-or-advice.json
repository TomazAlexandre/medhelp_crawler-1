            "answer": "As an insulin dependent Type 11 diabetic who had shoulder surgery last September and went highly adverse effects rom anesthesia, I can say encouragement goes a long way. My A1C went through the roof almost to the levels when I was diagnosed. I ended up in full DKA and in ICU. With hemoglobin levels at over 11 I totally had to change my life and insulin plan. Now finally my levels have stabilized and I am on the right track again.This is my small success story. If I can do it any one can.Sorry for your losses due to your miscarriages. I wish you much luck on your journey.",

            "answer": "I am sorry fro your miscarriages. My prayers are with you as for your diabetes I can share my story I have been pre-diabetic for a while probably a year and was not eating right like I should and went into full-blown diabetes in December. Welll while on vacation almost 2 months ago I went into hypoglycemia and did not know it. I was urinating a lot and thirsty. When I got home from vacation I tested my blood sugar it was 458. When I went to my doctor my A-1 C was 12.1. I was in denial but after that visit I\u00a0\u00a0changed my life. My weight was 303. A month and a half later I am well on my way. I am down to 276 pounds and my blood sugar is stable between 85 and 130. My advice to you in managing your diabetes is do not eat after 8:00 PM. Focus on tasty low-carb food searches salads watch the dressing eat low-carb beans. Take low-carb snacks with you between meals to crave your\u00a0\u00a0hunger such as nuts. The most important thing that I have done to manage my blood sugar is to exercise every day except Sunday the day I stretch and rest my body. Try to get 20 to 30 minutes in at least every day on the elliptical or walking being active every day will help manage your blood sugar and keep it in control. You can do it I'm praying for you.",
