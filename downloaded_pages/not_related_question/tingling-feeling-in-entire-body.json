            "answer": "Hi,I\u2019m really sorry to hear about your condition . The symptoms could be of\u00a0\u00a0an autoimmune disease .Some examples are -\u00a0\u00a0Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy\u00a0\u00a0characterised by\u00a0\u00a0swelling and destruction of myelin sheath over the nerves resulting in numbness and tingling all over the body and\u00a0\u00a0Multiple sclerosis that affects the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord )and impairs the nerve signals thus causing neurological symptoms. Patients usually\u00a0\u00a0feel numbness, tingling, pain, burning, and visual disturbances along with tremors .Other important causes that need to be ruled out are Diabetes and heavy metal poisoning . Please get yourself checked for these . Diabetes and metal poisoning\u00a0\u00a0causes neuropathy thus resulting in numbness , tingling , ringing in the ears etc . Skin lesions may also be associated .Nerve symptoms may also be caused by a lot of other factors \u2013 Pressure on peripheral\u00a0\u00a0nerves , Pressure on spinal nerves , Herpes Zoster infection , underactive thyroid , Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon\u00a0\u00a0or toxic nerve damage .Please consult your doctor and get the routine tests done \u2013 blood tests , thyroid tests , Sugar levels and other investigations suggested\u00a0\u00a0by the doctor after complete examination . I would suggest you to go for MRI of brain and spine , Full body scan and nerve conduction studies and consult a neurologist . The skin problem may or may not be related to the nerve problems . Please consult\u00a0\u00a0a dermatologist for the examination of the leg . Hope this helps you . Take care and regards !",
