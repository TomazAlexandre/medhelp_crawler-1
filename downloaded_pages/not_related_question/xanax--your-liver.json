            "answer": "Not sure about Xanax, but I do know that when the liver is stressed the best thing he can be taking to protect it is Milk Thistle. If you research it online, you will learn it has no known side affects, and is very beneficial for people with liver issues. He will want to cut alcohol out as much as possible as it will only stress the liver more, and it feeds diabetes.www.**********.com",

            "answer": "Thanks a lot for your post. I asked my Doctor to give me a full panel because of my past drug use. Well I was told that I had a positive antibody for hep c. My doctor told me that more than likely my hep c was in remission. I have been clean and sober going on nine years, and was never really into alcohol, and these days I am so scared to even take a anything over the counter. My doctor does have me on 5mg of Xanax at night for sleep. I have asked him a lot of times if he is sure that the Xanax is okay to take, and he always promises me that it's fine to take. Other than that one time that I took a panel and they said I was positive for an anti body I have had no other check ups. The doctor says I seem to be fine but when I'm ready to see a specialist he will refer me to one. What do you recommend. I really do feel great and have no symptoms, but at the same time I am worried because I have had a lot of friends die from Hep C. One thing I will mention is they also continued to use, and live in there addictions. Like I said I have been clean and sober going on nine years, and other than what the doctor says is okay for me to take I wont touch out of fear.",
