            "answer": "Grifter has some good comments.It is entirely possible that you can have a normal blood pressure, lab results, and other testing, but still be at risk. There are are many things that also put us at risk for developing heart disease, which include obesity, smoking, and genetics (family history). If your parents or siblings in particular had heart disease, that increases your risk significantly (especially if they had heart disease before the age of 55).While your normal pressure and labs do confer a lower risk for you, it doesn't eliminate it completely. If you are having intermittent chest pains, consider seeing your primary physician or a cardiologist for an EKG, and depending on your story, can pursue more testing if necessary. If the lab work is recent (past 6-12 months) it won't have to be repeated, just make sure your Endocrinologist shares it with the other docs.",
