            "answer": "Great job first off in having the thyroid tested. It sounds more like diabetes at this point. Diabetes is a hormonal disease much like hypothyroidism and has been known to effect dogs more quickly when they have other hormonal imbalances. Speak with your vet again, they will likely ask for a urine sample so discuss that first when you speak with their team members as they can help you collect a sample. Dont leave this any longer, no matter what the cause is, early detection makes treatment and a possible cure much much easier.",
