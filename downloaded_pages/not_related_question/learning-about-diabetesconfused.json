            "answer": "Hi,A totally normal fasting number is in the mid 80s.With your current numbers you should see your dr about treatment.\u00a0\u00a0208 post eating is way too high.Following a low carb diet, and exercise will help. Normalising weight if overweight will also help (much harder with hasimotos).Levo does not raise blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0However, if your thyroid is out of wack then that can affect blood sugars.Get a blood sugar meter and keep track.\u00a0\u00a0YOu can also use the meter to work out which foods do and don't raise blood sugars (by testing about 2 hours after eating).\u00a0\u00a0Your target is < 140 and even better < 120 after eating.\u00a0\u00a0IF higher, then you need to modify what you ate to reduce the carbs.\u00a0\u00a0IF you are still high even on low carb then you need medications.Diabetes is certainly manageable and is not a death sentence.\u00a0\u00a0But the early and more aggressively you manage it the better the long and very long term outcomes will be.",

            "answer": "I would suggest you work with an endocrinologist in conjunction with your regular physician if you aren't already.\u00a0\u00a0The problems with forums like this is, you're getting information second hand and normally not from qualified health care professionals.\u00a0\u00a0The information will fluctuate.My wife's endo says a fasting blood glucose level should be less than 100.\u00a0\u00a0He is completely satisfied with that and information above says 80.Each of us are different and respond differently to different meds.\u00a0\u00a0Again, I suggest seeing and endo if you aren't already.Good luck and keep in touch around here.",

    "question": "I am not diabetic but pre-diabetic. I have hashimotos and currently take levothyroxine 75 mg. I had been urinating every 5-10 for the last 36 hours. I had someone test my blood sugar late evening yesterday and it was 208 (I was scared to death) I fasted overnight and tested it this morning (108). There are claims that levo raises BS. I am also on a host of other supplements. What should I be doing or what questions should I be asking my doctor.",
