            "answer": "Hello,your A1C of 7.3 in December (or 6.3) latest are still above normal, considering that persons without diabetes will test at < 5.0.Great that you are using lifestyle measures to help.If you are overweight, reaching optimal weight will have a big benefit.\u00a0\u00a0Keep up your efforts on the diet.\u00a0\u00a0A low carb diet (avoid grains, fruits, sweets) and focus on low carb veges and proteins and healthy fats will be very beneficial.\u00a0\u00a0You could also look up the book \"diabetes solutions\" which explains low carb diet and blood sugar management.Do you have a blood glucose meter?\u00a0\u00a0If you have one of these you can test 1 1/2 - 2 hours after eating a meal and you can then see the effecvt of that meal and use the results to modify what you are eating.\u00a0\u00a0Normal blood glucose should be < 120 at all times.You could also add in exercise.\u00a0\u00a0A 30 minute brisk walk after each meal (or whenever you can fit it in) will also contribute to improving your blood sugars.If your next test (repeat in about 2 months) is still high, would recommend that you see a Dr. and probably try some medication such as metformin to further assist you in your efforts.Keep up the good work!",

            "answer": "I am down to about 100 lbs on this diet I put myself on.\u00a0\u00a0I used to weight about 112 - 115.\u00a0\u00a0My diet was 2 fold - 1 was to lower my blood sugar and 2 - to lower my cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0I do have a glucose monitor and it is usually under 120 two hours after eating, but this morning it was 141 when I took a fasting blood sugar test, I did have an avacado, healthy choice fudge bar (I cheated) pasta and peanuts!\u00a0\u00a0Just wondering doesn't a person build up a resistance to metformin and need more and more, or does metformin eventually stop working?\u00a0\u00a0I am so guilty of not exercising enough!\u00a0\u00a0I work full time and my excuse is that I am too tired to walk.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks so much for your input.\u00a0\u00a0Julie :)",
