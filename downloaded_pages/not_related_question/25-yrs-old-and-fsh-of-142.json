            "answer": "A high FSH before the age of 40, especially at age 25, is called premature menopause or premature ovarian failure (POF). Stress and type 2 diabetes are not believed to be causes of a high FSH.Many time the cause of this is unknown. It can be due to chromosomal or genetic reasons, inflammatory or autoimmune reasons, or removal of the ovaries or destruction of the ovaries by conditions such as endometriosis, cysts, tumors or other causes. About half the time there is no obvious cause. The one thing that didn't cause it is anything you did. POF happens to about 1-2% of women.Talk with a reproductive endocrinologist (fertility specialist). Even if it turns out that you cannot use your own eggs to have a child, it is very possible to have a child by egg donation which involves getting an egg or eggs from another woman. She can either beShe can either be someone you know or anonymous. The success rate with that procedure is very high, you would still use your partner's sperm and you would carry the pregnancy. It is now a very common procedure. It is also helpful to see a mental health practitioner because POF is a loss and it is very helpful to have someone help you with the disappointment you are feeling. Also talk with your doctor about getting a bone density and ask about other things that might be helpful as a result of POF.Machelle M. Seibel, MD",

            "answer": "Thank you for your response, I truly appreciate it.If we decide to use an egg donor, do you think it would matter if we did it in a few years? Or does this condition gradually make having a successful pregnancy more difficult?",

            "answer": "The same thing happened to me when I was 31 yrs old, my FSH was in the 90's but the doctor never mentioned ovarian failure or menopause.\u00a0\u00a0She said it was just stress and put me back on birth control to get my periods. The real truth is that I had reached menopause at an early age.My periods have always been irregular. Now, that I am 40 yrs old and stopped taking bc, i never got my period anymore and the new doctor decided to check my FSH and it came back elevated at 79.4 which is post menopausal.\u00a0\u00a0Now, that I am more informed about FSH, it was hard in the beginning to face it and I still can't believe it.My doctor said that the only way I can have another child was to use an egg donor.Check out this website, it has a lot of information about high fsh.www. highfshinfo.com\u00a0\u00a0 Believe me, you are not alone.\u00a0\u00a0I was also very devastated when I found this out.",

            "answer": "A high FSH will not affect the chances of a donor egg pregnancy being successful; in fact, a high FSH is a common reason people turn to donor eggs.\u00a0\u00a0Most REs will do a donor egg ivf cycle on a woman until her 50th birthday.\u00a0\u00a0You do have to have a normal uterus and they put you through a number of physical tests after age 45.\u00a0\u00a0If you have diabetes, you should ask your RE if that is a factor for concern in donor egg ivf.\u00a0\u00a0 So really you have lots of time to do a donor egg cycle.\u00a0\u00a0It is a really expensive procedure, but there some REs offer money back programs if you don't go home with a baby, as the odds of success are very high (up to 80% per ivf cycle).\u00a0\u00a0God bless you--it must be very hard to have a high FSH at such a young age, but you still have options in becoming a mother :).",
