            "answer": "Omphaloceles are generally simple hernias of the bowel within the umbilical cord. However, some can be very large and result in large hernia sacs extending from the abdominal wall and contain the fetal liver, stomach and bowel. Simple omphaloceles where loops of bowel are within a hernia sac adjacent to the umbilical cord can be associated with chromosomal or genetic syndromes. When the chromosome testing is normal and no other abnormalities are found on ultrasound, they are sporadic developmental abnormalities and the risk for future pregnancies is low. Such defects develope in the first trimester of pregnancy and therefore would not be caused by gestational diabetes that develops later in pregnancy. There is some evidence that taking 4-5 mg of folic acid daily starting at least 3 months before you next pregnancy can reduce the risks for recurrence of abdominal wall defects as well as congenital heart defects and spina bifida.",
