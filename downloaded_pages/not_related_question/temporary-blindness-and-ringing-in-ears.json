    "question": "A couple of weeks ago, I awoke as normally to get ready for work.\u00a0\u00a0As I reached the fridge to brag something to drink, my lower abdoman started to hurt.\u00a0\u00a0I have Dysmenorrhea, so I braced myself and prepared for the worst.\u00a0\u00a0Things were quite different this time.\u00a0\u00a0First, I became dizzy and my ears started this very very high-pitched ringing/whining.\u00a0\u00a0Then both eyes gradually blacked completely out.\u00a0\u00a0I mean TOTAL and COMPLETE blindness of both eyes.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't pass-out/faint or anything, but I did begin to panic.. so I called to my roommate.\u00a0\u00a0She told me to sit/relax and breathe.\u00a0\u00a0After a few minutes I could then subtly and gradually \"see\" differences in dept (i.e. I could \"see\" outlines of large objects), then \"energy\"/color (mainly red) started to filter in.\u00a0\u00a0(Full-spectrum color followed soon after.)\u00a0\u00a0It took a few moments extra for the ringing, abdominal pain, and dizzyness to subside.However.. a few days prior to this happening, I did attend a concert.\u00a0\u00a0And, I can't recall smelling anything out of the ordinary.My roommate also said that this has happened before, but I would remember anything remotely similar.\u00a0\u00a0I can recall nothing of the sort; although, I have experienced \"head rushes\" before (but, nothing of this severity).Any ideas???",
