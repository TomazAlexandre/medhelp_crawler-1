            "answer": "You need to be evaluated by a neurologist. The most common cause for a neuropathy is diabetes, however there are other causes as well. Some, such as thyroid disease, and Vitamin B12 deficiency, can be treated. You may need to have an EMG test (muscle/nerve test) which tests the function of the nerves. However in a number of patients a cause is never found. Then control of symptoms needs to be done. The most common medication for treatment of neuropathy pain is Neurontin. You can discuss this with your doctor. Good luck.",
