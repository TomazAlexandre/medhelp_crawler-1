            "answer": "The likelihood of this being secondary to ischemic heart disease is unlikely but is also dependent on your risk factors for heart disease, that is your age, presence of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or pre-existing heart disease. Now you could have a heart rhythm, disorder, such as a tachycardia, which could be diagnosed with the use of a\u00a0\u00a0Holter monitor. But these arrhythmias can also occur in the setting of lung disease, so if you have symptoms or signs of pulmonary problems such as an infection then you should have that addressed first ( via antibiotics etc) and then if the arrhythmia recurs, ask for a Holter monitor so the diagnosis can be narrowed.",

    "question": "I sleep on my right side, if my left arm is outstrecthed in a certain position I wake up with my heart racing and I feel that my chest is tight, and it is hard to breathe. Of course I try not to have my left arm in that position but I cannot seem to help it. I want to go to my doctor and was wondering do you think it could be a heart problem or lung problem? I also feel alot of mucous in the back of my throat when I wake up in the morning. Thanks for any advice to seeing what could be wrong.",
