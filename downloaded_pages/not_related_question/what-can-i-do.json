    "question": "Hello Dr Gould,My Boyfriend got severe depressions for over a year now. It gets worse and worse.He doesn't do anything anymore we both used to enjoy. For so long i thought he was just mad but it goes so much deeper.We had a terrible weekend where i about threw the towel in this relation ship. He opened up a little saying he doesn't even know whats wrong with him and why he is feeling like he does. He is on so many meds because of his diabetic. He can not function at all, as a man or as a person. I've told him I would go to his Dr with him but all he says is. \"you know how i feel about doctors\" I know i have to be strong but sometimes it feels like handling another child in the house.He tries so hard to be like he used to. I just want him back the way he was a loving caring man.Right now i don't even know what to say to him, because he lashes out almost like he is angry. He sleeps too much and the rest of the day he just lays on the couch, doesn't talk just stares in the air.No energy, no life left in him. I;m afraid he might get suicidal. I wish he would take my help. I've told him so many times that he is not alone in this. I will be on his side.But how do i make him understand that he is ill and not getting crazy?Thank you for reading thisUte",
