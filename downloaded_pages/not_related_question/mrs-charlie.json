            "answer": "Hi,Why does your doctor keep changing medications? Are your glucose numbers good on your current medications? Those are two major questions from the start.Overall though, I encourage you to give this a good shot because it is very important.\u00a0\u00a0Definitely not in the \"who cares\" category--we care! Talk to your doctor about your current treatment plan and establish some goals for the next visit. This may help stop the roller coaster and get things going in the right direction.Take care.",

            "answer": "Hi,The neuropathy your doctor mentioned can be caused by diabetes, and supports the suspicion that your blood sugars have been high for some time. This may get better as your blood sugars come down.Given the pattern in your sugars(i.e rising), you should definitely stay in close contact with your doctor and check your sugars regularly. I encourage you to be aggressive about this and not wait months for return appointments, letting your sugars stay high for all that time. If you do not see improvements after 2 weeks of a change in medications, contact your doctor. It does take work to get diabetes controlled sometimes, but it well worth it. Your body will feel much better once your sugars come down.Take care",
