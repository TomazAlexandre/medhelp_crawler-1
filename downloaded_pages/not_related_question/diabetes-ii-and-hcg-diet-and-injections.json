            "answer": "It might help if you explained what the \"HCG\" diet is. Most Type II diabetics find they are helped in controlling their blood sugar by a combination of eliminating sugar and lowering the amount of carbs they eat. (fruit, unfortunately, is high in carbs and tends to spike the blood sugar of Type 2 diabetics). A blood sugar of 160 is too high; you should be testing at two hours and by three it should be significantly down from that. Rather than look for fad diets, it is much more useful to make these changes, add regular exercise and then test regularly two hours after meals to see how various foods affect your blood sugar to get it under 140. We are all different, and testing allows you to see what works for you.When you say \"the injections\" I'm assuming you mean insulin. Some Type II's do need insulin eventually as their diabetes goes through a normal progression. You don't say how long you've been diagnosed or what your latest A1C is. The first step is to try and control your blood sugar with diet and exercise. When this no longer works, then the next consideration is oral meds. Insulin is a step beyond that. You might want also to see a diabetic educator or research on your own so you learn more about managing your diabetes.",

            "answer": "I am also looking to see who has type II diabetes and has used HCG and what have been the results before I decide to do it. Did you stop your medication? or did you stay on your medications? I am thinking your blood sugar would go down if you use both and that would be no good, so I am thinking of just using the HCG - drops.",

But I got back to bad eating habits and gained a lot of it back but only about half of it and did the HCG again and lost it back. Then I had to take steroids for a neck injury and it swelled me up like a balloon and I got back up to 206. I am now type 2 and I am down to the mid 190's. I am starting the HCG diet in a few days and I will keep you posted on my weight loss and GI levels as i go through it. I am currently taking metformin but decreased the dosage in hald because my GI is staying in the normal range. I am also taking IC-5 suppliments.",
