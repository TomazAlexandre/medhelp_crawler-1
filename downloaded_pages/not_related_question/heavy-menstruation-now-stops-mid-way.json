            "answer": "Hi!If you were my patient, I would do a complete exam and pap as well as an ultrasound.Your low TSH could be a sign of Graves disease or postpartum thyroiditis., so I would also send you to see an endocrinologist about that.I would suspect that you have either fibroids or adenomyosis in your uterus, and that is the cause of the heavy periods.\u00a0\u00a0Thyroid dysfunction can also affect the cycles.If my exam findings confirmed my suspicions of adnenomyosis or fibroids, etc. I would discuss a few options with you--oral contraceptives are a good option for women who want to preserve their fertility. The Mirena IUD can work wonders in some cases.Endometrial ablation is also a possibility if you have finished your family.There is usually a reason that periods are excessively heavy, so I would encourage you to pursue it a bit further.Good luck!Dr B",

            "answer": "Hi, thanks for your impressions. So they did an ultasound (including inta-vaginal) and reported normal. My thyroid t4 and T3 are in the mid to lower normal range. Do these tests cover the bases you were talking about or should I ask my doc to perdue other tests??Thanks!!",

            "answer": "I had same thing - 50 mg zinc gluconate and periods normal to none and white splotches gone. Also had hyperpigmentation on face, chest, and arms that has faded significantly. I divide dose into quarters and take through out the day - they also prescribe Nora be for this, but prefer zinc - moods are not effected negatively with zinc gluconate.",
