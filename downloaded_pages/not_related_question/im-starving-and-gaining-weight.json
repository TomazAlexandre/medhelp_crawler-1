            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.The diagnosis of diabetes can lead to many lifestyle changes. Changing your diet can be very difficult. Often people are left feeling deprived of favorite foods. Often we use carbohydrates as \"fillers\" with our meals. Decreasing or eliminating them can leave us hungry soon after a meal.If possible I would recommend that you speak with a nutritionist. Your doctor may have one that they can recommend. The nutritionist can help you with meal plans and portion sizing. They can help you to balance your diet in a way that will not leave you feeling empty after a meal.If a nutritionist is not an option, ask your doctor about any diabetic meal plans that they recommend. You can also try eating smaller, more frequent meals. This will help keep your blood sugar levels a little more steady and prevent the peaks and valleys that can lead to hunger.I hope this helps,Cathy",
