            "answer": "There is no hard and fast rule to this question. it all depends on how your particular Liver ,Pancreas and cells manage now that you have got your blood sugar levels down to where they should be.I was diagnosed Type 2 back in jan 2016. I was put on Glicazide 2x 80 mg a day .By reducing my sugar intake my BS level went from 28 mmol/L down to a fasting 5mmol/L within 3 weeks .After 4x weeks I cut my Glicazide in half to 40mmol/L and my BS levels stayed stable.\u00a0\u00a0At first I had the occasional Hypoglycemic episode after hard exercise BS level down to 2.7-3.5mmol/L but after eating a couple of busicuits and some fat and protein it came back up within 1/2 an hour or so. The Hypoglycemic episodes stopped completely after about 3 months.After two months I cut the Glicazide out completely and\u00a0\u00a0my BS levels have stayed stable ever since. if I eat something sugary like a couple of digestive buiscuits my BS level goes up to 8-9mmol/L within half an hour but within 2 hours it has come back down to around 6-7mmol/LI was given Metformin but I decided not to take it. The reason for this is Metformin is not recommended for people with Liver issues . It\u00a0\u00a0was prescribed to me by a Diabetic Nurse and I am amazed that a Nurse is allowed to prescribe dangerous drugs at all without a Doctors recommendation .My advice would be to reduce your metaformin slowly over several weeks and carefully monitor your blood sugar levels. See how your bodys sugar and fat processing mechanisms cope. If you notice any significant change that doesn't right itself after say 4-5 days then increase your Metformin back to where it was.Good luck",
