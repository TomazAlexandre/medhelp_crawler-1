            "answer": "Hello, without being personally involved in your case, I cannot make any surgical recommendations.However, I can comment on the fevers - that should be further investigated.\u00a0\u00a0This is especially important in the presence of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Abscesses from the surgery should be considered - an abdominal/pelvic CT scan would be a reasonable first step.\u00a0\u00a0Another test would be a tagged white cell study if the fevers continue.Regarding the self-catheterization, if there isn't an acceptable surgical solution, a suprapubic catheter (i.e. a permanent catheter) can be considered in place of intermittent self-catheterization.Another opinion by a urologist at an academic medical center should beconsidered.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

            "answer": "I am 4 days post-op, I just underwent surgery for a sling. I am voiding on my own, I have little bleeding and very little discharge period. Heres my situation...I am having excruciating pain, burning, stabbing sensation in my groin area that starts around the left incision site and runs down into the thigh. My doc has put me on muscle relaxers because he thinks I am having muscle spasms. He admits that I am the first to have this pain. I am worried. Has anyone had this before?",

    "question": "I had my bladder tacted in 1983 by a incinsion in my lower stomach. It lasted 17 years. I went back to the same ob Dr. and my bladder had fell and pushed out my vagina. IHe wanted to do a sling. I had researched it and ask not to have it but to use the same bladder tacting as I had 17 yrs. ago. He talked me into the sling. That was Feb. 2003. Since I had 4 months of not being able to empty my bladder ,so he is in bad health now so suggested one his partners slit the sling. I decided to get a opion of a urogist. He scoped me and thought I had bladder cancer. That come back pockets of infection. after 4 months of antibitics ,I keep infetions and I am not empting my bladder. I'm 48 and he told me yesterday I would have to cath. my self for the rest of my life. That is not a solution to me so I am trying to find a dr. that will remove the sling and tact my bladder by cutting along the same incision I had 17 yrs. ago.I can't work anymore. I have to try to work out of my home so my income has been cut 3/4 in 1 year. I have recurring infections, temps. 102.I also, have accidents usally twice during the night and I can't say how many when I'm out doing errands. It's so embarising to wet yourself in public. Sometimes when it hits I have no control at all. I can't fish ,golf ,none of the activies I was doing. I'm a diabetic also, can't go walking either. My whole life has been affected my this. I'm willing to travel to where ever for someone willing to do this surgery. If they can replace lungs ,hearts and all the amazing things that can be done ,why can't this sling be removed and since the other lasted so long ,I want that surgery again.ThanksLinda S Herron",
