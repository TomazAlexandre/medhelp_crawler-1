            "answer": "HI,There can be lots of reasons for dizziness related to diabetes: dehydration, high or low blood sugars, nerve problems, kidney problems, heart problems, strokes etc. Dizziness that is worsened by moving your head may more likely be due to a problem in the inner ear. In any case, you should be examined by your doctor and then the appropriate tests ordered if necessray because this often cannot be diagnosed appropriately without an exam.Take care.",
