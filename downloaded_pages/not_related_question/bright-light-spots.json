    "question": "In my left eye I've had a floater that stays in the center of my vision and doesn't move around for over a year, but it's not really all that troublesome - I can ignore it now. Over the last few days I've been having random very intensely bright small spots of light that come and go over a matter of seconds in the center of my vision too - right by my floater. Again, not troublesome...just weird and new.I've had iritis in my right eye - that was troublesome for about a year - but eventually I could taper off the NSAID drops and it's been behaving reasonably well since. That was about 2 yrs ago.I did go to the optometrist last summer about the floater. They checked it out and only found a slight bit of cateract formation around the edge of the lens - but no issues other than that.I'm 34, female, no diabetes, do have fibromyalgia with some odd neurological things. My MRI is fine. I do get migraines frequently, but the lights haven't been involved with them (no migraine anywhere around the time I've seen one) and I've not experienced them before with a migraine. I am rather nearsighted. -7 in the left -7.5 in the right. Prescription has been stable for them for a while.Any tips? Things I should watch for? I'd rather avoid going to see my poor doctor *again* for something that is 'nothing' you know? I'm not stressed about this, but want to be proactive about my vision.",
