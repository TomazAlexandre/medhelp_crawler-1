            "answer": "deb,It's difficult to make exact recommendations without hearing your husbands story and examining him.A few points, his elevate heart rate is of some concern. Im not sure if he has other evidence of neuropathic complications of his diabetes (eyes, nerves, etc) but autonomic dysfunction is very common in diabetics and could present with similar symptoms.Some element of assensing his overall heart function should be performed..ie echo to assess his function given his symptoms.A stress test can have false positives and false negatives. The next step would really be dependent on his overall story. If you are not comfortable with your physicians decision, I would urge you to seek a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Either way you should ensure your husbands other cardiac risk factors are assessed very carefully given his diabetes and family history.",

            "answer": "By the way, I have a very high heart rate most of the time its 100-120 while sitting and/or resting.\u00a0\u00a0They've done numerous tests to figure out what it is.\u00a0\u00a0So far, it's believed to be asymtpomatic Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia and Orthostatic Intolerance (since I don't have any troubling symptoms).\u00a0\u00a0We will do a repeat holter monitor test 6/2004, to see what my heart rate is off most of my medications (I have idiopathic severe emphysema and severe chronic asthma, as well as gastric reflux; it is believed that some of these meds--Prilosec, Atrovent, Serevent, Biaxin, Qvar, Zyrtec, Flonase--may be contributing to the fast heart rate).\u00a0\u00a0I have never smoked, no alcohol, no caffeine.If my heart rate remains just as high off the meds as it was on the meds, it will support the tentative diagnoses.\u00a0\u00a0My cardiologist is inclined to just do periodic echocardiograms to be sure I don't develop cardiomyopathy (heart damage) due to my chronic high heart rate.I'm planning to ask him about pros & cons of a trial of calcium channel blockers, to try to reduce my heart rate, plus the periodic echos.\u00a0\u00a0I feel my poor lung function offers enough challenges to my body, especially my heart, without it having to work so hard with the tachycardia as well.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, I don't really want to add any more meds to the ones I'm already taking.\u00a0\u00a0Since I'm only 46, I plan to live many more years & it seems prudent to take optimal care of heart & lungs.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think the beta agonists would be good for my lung function (which is the other common medication prescribed for this type of tachycardia).Would love any input from Hankstar, the doctor, or others who might have additional insights.\u00a0\u00a0My cardiologist considers my case very unusual, particularly since I tolerate the tachycardia so well and am fairly young for all these idiopathic health issues.Aloha,Starion",

            "answer": "Thank you for answering. The doctor has my husband on an Event Monitor for the present time, to see if they can pick anything up. They did the regular stress test and it showed negative. If he has anymore of these \"episodes\", I am going to press for him to be further evaluated with an Echo or whatever else they can do. I just do not feel comfortable going only on the results of a stress test.......whether it be just the regular stress test or the nuclear stress test. My father had a total of 3 stress test 6 months ago.........1 was a nuclear.......and none showed that he had any trouble going on. He eventually had to have a cath done and found 4 bad blockages.Back to my husband. He is a bad diabetic. Takes 2 different insulins, and it is not under control at present. But, he had this high heart rate before he was ever diagnosed with the diabetes. It has just seemed to get higher in the last few months(heart rate). I know that diabetics have the tendency to develop heart problems, so therefore, that's why I am so concerned about this.I really appreciate you taking the time to answer my question. I will keep close eye on him. I am not letting him drive, until we find what is going on. If this keeps happening, I will stress that I want further testing done. Would much rather pay a doctor for test that were ok, than take chance on something bad happening to him. We have only been married 1 1/2 years, and I want another 30 or more with him.",

            "answer": "I am 61, two plus years out from successful aortic valve replacement. Basically things have gone well, but -- for that reason or for some other -- I seem lately to have a consistently high pulse rate: between 100 and 115. The odd thing is that it is at least 100 when I first wake up in morning, without so much as getting out of bed. I may have a little light-headedness with it at times, but nothing very dramatic. So if is just part of the universe, I guess I live with it -- On the other hand, if it is indicative of other things with which to be concerned, then I'd rather tend to it.Peter",

            "answer": "hi, i have a question. I have a daughter that has a pacemaker and the pacemaker specialist said she is just using the pacemaker 13 percent of the time which is very low, does this mean she didn't need a pacemaker?? She was pacing when the heart rate went below 70 and today they changed it to 60 but everything seemed to be fine before they changed it .Should I expect anything different? Will she get sick ? The reason she had to have one was because she would pass out all the time. They also said they reprogrammed it because she had some irregularities in the heartbeat where the heart went to 260 but they said not to worry and to tell them if she has any problems and if so ..come back to the dr. right away.(They were acting like they were really concerned about something but didn't want us to know yet)... I'm trying to learn as much about this as i can so i won't feel so \"dumb\" when they try to explain things . she is only 19. She has had a couple of episodes like she was going to pass out but the pacemaker report did not show anything. They just say she isn't using it very much at all so it makes me wander if she really needed it. We thought this answered all our questions and she has never felt better and 13percent may be great ! It just seems like they make us feel like \"why does she have this\" She doesn't see her Dr. that put in the device until August. And we think the world of him! She has had this for 7 months now. well if anyone out there can inform us on whats good on pacing and whats not would greatly be appreciated. thanks ....concerned mom..",

I am 50 going thru menopause etc... I told her NO WAY so she took a drug test without me knowing it .. It came back negative ..So she put me on a different blood pressure medication ..It is not a very high dose and it seemed to slow it down some but it runs at about 130 when I am walking around and is never lower than about 110I am trying to go to the gym and exersise , I am overweight by about 40 pds , quit smoking 4 years ago ..I notice my heart rate a lot .. I use the heart rate monitors when Im exercizing and can only do so much or it gets my rate up to over 150 very fast ..I dont like it to go over 150 when Im exersising .. I feel sorta dizzy sometimes and of course with the pulse rate this high , it makes me nervous which doesnt help ..I have asked at the VA about it but my doctor there is just not concerned about anything ..It is hard to know .. I need to know if this is a bad thing ..I have high colestrial also and gall stones so I cant take anything for hormone therapy so IM getting thru the menopause without anything..What does anyone think of this constant high heart rate .ITs nerve wracking ..Thanks a lotSara",

            "answer": "Sara,You need to see an electrophsiologist to determine why your rate is so high. You need an echo for sure, and he may want to order an EP study to see if you have an arrythmia that is cuasing this, and if it is, he can burn the cells that are 'excitable' (the ones that are causing the arrythmia) and you have a 99% success rate of being cured and you would not need heart meds any longer... but I am not a dr and don't know what kind of heart problem you are dealing with, so i can only go off my own experience. I have had great experiences with ablations-- they have lowered my rates, permanently. I am not perfect, but I have a complicated heart, 2 different arrythmias and one of them the EP could not get to becuase of way too much scar tissue on my heart. But there are plenty of success stories out there. My resting rate used to be 160, sometimes 250bpm. Then, after my first ablation, it went down to 150 , and I never got 250 rates.. then after the 3rd, I am now resting at 120, not perfect, but its SO much better!!!!!!!! :) there is hope for you!",

    "question": "Hi.....and thank you in advance. My husband is 38 & a diabetic. He always runs a very high pulse rate(between 110 & 130). He has been having spells where he got dizzy & felt tight in his chest. Was evaluated the other day with a stress test, which showed up ok. I have a bad feeling about the stress test, as my father had 3 done that showed nothing wrong with his heart, but he kept getting worse & was catherized & found 4 blockages. This has me very concerned about my husband. He is having these spells when driving. Could you please give me some kind of hint as to what might possibly be going on with him? I know it is hard to do without seeing him, but I just want to know should I insist that he be elvaluated by a cardiologist. I trust our doctor...............it's just a matter of me having peace of mind I guess. Thank you.",
