            "answer": "I am sorry but you are very vague about the types of tests that were performed in your evaluation. Hence I can't comment on the seriousness of your problem. However, I can say that if you only had SVT on a holter monitor, and a normal ejection fraction on a echo cardiogram then you are at low risk from dying from an arrhythmia.Now you are concerned about having a heart attack, and I am not sure that these symptoms place you at an increase risk for an MI. Also not sure what tests have\u00a0\u00a0been performed., or if you have any risk factors for CAD ( such as diabetes, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease). All of these factors have to be looked at in the evaluation of your risk for having CAD, and then appropriate tests ordered.If you only symptoms are the ones named above, and don't have any other risk factors, then it is extremely unlikely that you would be at any higher risk than any other 44 year old.",

            "answer": "you're not likely to drop dead of a heart attack from what you describe, it's probably just an SVT.\u00a0\u00a0 You should wear a 30-day event monitor to try and catch one of these fast rhythms, ask your doctor about it",

    "question": "I am a 44 year old female.\u00a0\u00a0About 11 years ago I had a first episode of rapid heartbeat while pregnant with my second child.\u00a0\u00a0Seen by a cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0Had many tests run.\u00a0\u00a0No significant findings.\u00a0\u00a0Episode happened again 2 years later while pregnant with twins.\u00a0\u00a0Seen by a cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0Had many tests run.\u00a0\u00a0No significant findings.\u00a0\u00a0Had these episodes very intermitently until the last 2 years.\u00a0\u00a0They occur every 4 - 5 months now!\u00a0\u00a0Seen by cardilogists.\u00a0\u00a0Many tests run.\u00a0\u00a0No signigicant findings.However, the Drs have noted my anemia may be the cause but I've always been anemic and have a higher blood count now than I did 11 years ago due to increased iron intake.Dr has also noted that I may have a hiatial hernia, developed within the last 2 years, which may also be a contributing factor.I'M AFRAID I'M NOT BEING DIAGNOSED PROPERLY AND WILL DROP DEAD OF A HEART ATTACK BECAUSE THE CARDIOLOGISTS ARE NOT CATCHING SOMETHING!!Thanks,CeeJay",
