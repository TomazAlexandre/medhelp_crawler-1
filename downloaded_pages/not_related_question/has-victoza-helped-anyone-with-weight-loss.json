            "answer": "I cannot answer your question directly on weight loss. Victoza is a new kid on the block approved by the FDA in January 2010. It is too new to fully understand its good vs bad on humans. In animal studies, Victoza caused tumors of the thyroid gland in rats and mice. Whether it will aid in weight loss is unknown as no weight loss studies were conducted. Your best solution is a lifestyle change; proper nutrition and exercise. No pill can do what you can to do for yourself.Lisonopril - Do you have kidney issues? I would ask your doctor why \"he seems to think this is a good medication to take.\" For what? Get a full explanation and don't leave his office until you feel satisfied with his answer.If you have doubts on any drug, or need more information about them go see and discuss them with your local pharmacist.",

I have been on Victoza since Oct 8 and have been experiencing the side effects, nausea and terrible upper gi heartburn and a lot of burping. I have lost about 8lbs and feel like I have to force myself to eat. I have been having fantastic blood sugar numbers, fasting has been under 100 the entire time! and my after dinner sugars have been in the normal range every day but one. I am up to the 1.2 level now and don't see how I will ever get to the full 1.8, then again, do I need the full 1.8? I am on 1000 mg metformin twice a day and my lantus is cut down to 10 units. I'm sticking it out, but it is hard. Any long term advice? I feel the side effects may out weigh the benefits, lower blood sugars, weight loss and hopefully a better A1C, although my last six months of A1C has been 6.8 and 6.6 (that was all achieved by insulin use, diet and exercise). I know there is no magic wand, but I need some encouragement",

The nausea was so bad my doctor started me from the beginning. Along with the nausea from the Victoza I had a severe case of a sinusitis, which did not help. Eventually, we got in under control; I was taking 40 units of Lantus nightly, and 1000mg metformin. I am no longer taking Lantus but, I am still on metformin. Five months on Victoza I lost 32 pounds. Today I have lost a total of 48 pounds. A1C went from 8.2 to 6.7. Victoza does decrease your appetite tremendously; I have to force myself to eat at times. But, I also realized after not eating so much (stomach shrinkage) it becomes hard to overeat\u2026.which is a good thing for me. Victoza has been a Blessing for me.",

I started out with hyperthyroidism, which made me look deathly skinny, then went on medication, gained weight lost, plus more back and then developed an allergy to it causing me to have my thyroid 'killed' with radioactive iodine making my hypothyroid which makes you gain more weight! Recently, my endo told me that my thyroid was leveled, and I thought that it was great news... only to go to my PCP in November and have him test me and tell me I'm insulin resistant. So I'm on Metformin, 2000mg/day and I just started the Victoza; I haven't had any side effects... the first day I got dizzy for a minute but I went back to sleep and woke up fine and haven't had a problem since. I don't know when you take it, but I have a weird schedule so my boyfriend leaves for work at 4:30am and I get up, take all my medicine, including the victoza, and go back to sleep until I have to get up for work. This has been working for me, I don't have any adverse reactions. I have no appetite much of the time and have to force myself to eat something to keep my energy up, but aside from that first day, I've felt great on it.Kren9784",
