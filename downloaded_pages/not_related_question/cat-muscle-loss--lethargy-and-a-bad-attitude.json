    "question": "Last July, my cat, Fred (7), escaped from the house.\u00a0\u00a0That night, he had a sneezing fit and was later found nearly unconscious.\u00a0\u00a0We took him to the ER, where he spent several days being treated for a URI.When Fred returned from the ER, he was still lethargic and rarely jumped.\u00a0\u00a0He used to sleep with us or on the couch and jump into windows.\u00a0\u00a0All this stopped.\u00a0\u00a0A month into his recovery, he began to snap at us if we tried to touch his right side.\u00a0\u00a0The snapping became progressively worse.\u00a0\u00a0Eventually, he started meowing ferociously and following us around the house biting at our ankles.\u00a0\u00a0We took him to the vet who noticed he had pain in his right shoulder (normal X-rays).\u00a0\u00a0Pain killers didn\u2019t help.\u00a0\u00a0We think his front leg was injured the night of his escape because the ER vets noticed his claws on that paw were broken.Fred still has a slight limp and some pain in his leg.\u00a0\u00a0His behavior problems, lethargy and reduced jumping persist.\u00a0\u00a0We recently noticed a change in his fur/skin, which is dull and flakey.\u00a0\u00a0New food is helping somewhat.\u00a0\u00a0Fred appears to be sensitive to brushings (he used to like it, now it seems to hurt).\u00a0\u00a0He also feels fragile.\u00a0\u00a0At his last vet visit, we learned he lost 2 pounds (in about 2 mos.), most of which was muscle loss.\u00a0\u00a0Fred is overweight (started at about 18+ pounds 8 months ago, down to 14).\u00a0\u00a0Fred has a great appetite, drinks normally, and only vomits occasionally (which is normal for him).\u00a0\u00a0He does not appear to have digestive problems (defecation/urination are normal).All tests are normal (thyroid, diabetes, FIV, FeLV, CBC, kidney function, etc.).\u00a0\u00a0Fred is now getting a chest/abdomen X-rays/ultrasound, urinalysis and a FIV/FeLV retest.\u00a0\u00a0If the results are normal, we have no idea what to do.\u00a0\u00a0Our next step is to take him to a specialist.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe he has Myositis?\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts on what might be wrong would be greatly appreciated.",
