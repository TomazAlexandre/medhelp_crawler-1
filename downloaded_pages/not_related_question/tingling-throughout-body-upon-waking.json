            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Whole body tingling upon awakening could be a manifestation of breathing irregularity when asleep. Are you married or have a significant other who has witnessed your sleeping behavior? If there is irregularity (such as snoring, lack of breathing for a period of time, breathing too quickly, etc), you may need to see a sleep specialist. Also, you may need to adjust your sleeping position. Compressive neuropathies can occur in which your hand may be \u201casleep\u201d if a nerve is pinched. (This is similar to a leg falling asleep if sitting down for too long).If your symptoms are worse in the hands and feet, this may be a neuropathy. There are many causes to this group of disorders called \"neuropathies\". They include but are not limited to most commonly diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, autoimmune disorders such as lupus or a disease called Sjogren's, certain types of neoplasm, and certain toxins (such as lead). This is best evaluated, diagnosed, and treated by a neurologist.If your symptoms were constant on one side of your body without improvement, I would consider a stroke or multiple sclerosis to be the cause, which an MRI of the brain would be helpful to evaluate. Given your symptoms are throughout your body, it may be a manifestation of emotional/psychiatric problems related to stress (what is called somatization disorder). The latter is a true medical condition whereby instead of a patient experiencing depression or anxiety, they experience physical symptoms, and once the stress is addressed, the symptoms resolve. Lastly, fibromyalgia is another medical condition that leads to whole body pains/sensory changes, and is best treated with medications such as lyrica and neurontin, exercise, and physical therapy.You should continue discussing your symptoms with your physician. You may benefit from a referral to a neurologist.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

            "answer": "Perhaps you should consider a neurologist. Don't give up because your pcp doesn't want to do the work. It's your body, you should listen to it, it is trying to tell you something is wrong.",

            "answer": "Perhaps you need a different doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Many doctors don't take fibromyalgia seriously and many say it doesn't exist.\u00a0\u00a0However I have had it for 10 years and the tingling and numbness sound like it could be fibro.\u00a0\u00a0I started with numbness, tingling, and all kind of places on my upper section that felt like bruises but weren't.\u00a0\u00a0Like someone had beaten me with a ball peen hammer.\u00a0\u00a0My neck and right arm hurt like crazy and I was so tired I could barely move.\u00a0\u00a0Suggest you consult someone else that might take your symptoms more serious.",

            "answer": "Hi Ginger, you need to have your b12 and vitamin D levels checked!\u00a0\u00a0And do your own research as to what type of symptoms are related to each deficiency, such as the tingling sensations and shortness of breath.\u00a0\u00a0You also need to be aware that Metformin is linked to severe b12 deficiency and lisinopril also has some serious warning symptoms and interactions.\u00a0\u00a0good luck",

            "answer": "Hi Ginger, I have had the same thing happening to me. Always worst in the morning. Just saw the Neurosurgon and it appears that the cause for the tingling is bulging of a disc in my spine at the neck pinching nerves. That is why the sensation occurs primarily in the morning because of bad sleeping position/bad bed/bad pillow which further pinches the nerves. As I find out more will let you know.",

    "question": "I am a 48 year old female. I have a problem with total boby tingling upon waking, even my head and face, sometimes feeling like I have been breathing too shallow. This has been happening for about one yr. I occassionally have tingling throughtout the day in my legs, arms, and scalp. I spoke to my pcp about this problem and he said \"That doesn't make since\" and changed the subject. When sleeping I periodically wake with an arm, leg, or my side tingling. I also have periodic intense (so much as to wonder if something is broken) pain in different locations such as my shoulder, knee, neck, and back. It hurts for a day or two then goes away. I ask my pcp about \"Fibromyagia\" as my mother and sis have it but he said \"no\" and changed the subject. My labs at last physical looked normal except for chol. Surgeries I have had are C-section, gallbladder removal, angiogram (for chest pains, results showed left ventrical 37% blocked), carpel tunnel release (right and left). I have taken lisinopril 10mg or other bp meds.for 25 yrs.for high blood pressure, metformin 500mg. for 2 yrs for type 2 diabetes, aspirin 81mg. for 4 yrs., and currently am not taking a chol med. (took lipitor for 2 yrs., insurance co. did not want to pay for it- tried simvastatin and lovastatin but caused throat tightness and pain, and shortness of breath - have appt. with pcp to see what is next). I have a daily feeling of tiredness, fatigue, brain fog,and recently gained some weight.What could be causing this problem? What kind of Dr. should I see? Thank you.",
