            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Nonspecific white matter changes (as your radiologist describes) are also known as chronic small vessel disease. It can be due to the differentials your radiologist provided but also including diabetes, smoking, and high cholesterol. It is a disease of the small blood vessels of the brain (much like atherosclerosis, etc). It is not uncommon. Many people develop them with age.Why did you have an MRI of the brain? Do you have any neurological deficits? If you have neurological deficits, multiple sclerosis, other demyelinating disease, and vasculitis (an inflammatory process) must also be in the differential.You should continue working with your neurologist on these results. They should be taken in combination with the clinical examination and history.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

            "answer": "Thank you doctor. In regards to your questions,I don't smoke, I don't have diabetes but I do have high cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0My neurologist did the MRI because symptoms I was having indicated possible MS, since it didn't show that and due to all my symptoms, we believe I have fibromyalgia. I have been previously labed as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and tested positive for Epstein Barr. I also have peripheral neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps answer your questions and thank you so much for your answer to mine.",

    "question": "Hello, I just got the results of my brain scan to check for multiple sclerosis and thankfully, that came back negative; however, my neurologist was rather vague on the findings and he is foreign and hard for me to understand,so I thought I would post it here too and see what you think. I thank you in advance for any response:There are innumerable foci of abnormal signal intensity involving predominately the more peripheral portions of the centrum semiovale and corona radiata, without involvement of the subcortical U-fibers.\u00a0\u00a0When combined with the fact that the corpus callosum, middle cerebellar peduncles, areas adjacent to the temporal horns and subcortical U-fibers are normal, these changes are much more consistent with an ischemic etiology (? hypertensive vascular disease, migraine disease or vasculitis) rather than a demyelinating etiology.I have very low blood pressure (usually 90/60) and never have migraines so what should I determine from these findings and what/who should I see?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!!!",
