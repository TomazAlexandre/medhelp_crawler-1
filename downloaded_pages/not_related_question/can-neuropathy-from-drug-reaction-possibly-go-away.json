            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to obtain a history from you and examine you, I can not comment on a formal diagnosis or treatment plan for your symptoms. However, I will try to provide you with some information regarding this matter.There are many medications that can cause a peripheral neuropathy. The neuropathy is generally reversible once the medication has been stopped; however, it may take time. The difficulty arises if there are other medical conditions, such as diabetes, that may be a cause for a neuropathy. If this is the case, additional workup may be necessary including blood tests and an EMG/NCS (a test to evaluate the integrity of the nerves and muscles).Thank you for using the forum, I hope you find this information useful, good luck.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your response. It was helpful. Fortunately, there was a cancelation and I was able to see the neurologist. I am not diabetic. Having all my history he felt very certain, without the biospy, or emg that it is small fiber neuropathy and will resolve itself in up to 6 months.",

    "question": "Three weeks ago I had an allergic reaction on the 5th day of taking bactrim. My reaction was intense burning, needle pricking sensation along with some milder numbing and swelling primarily on extremeties, face and mouth. Now the symptoms are milder in the same locations and the numbing is primarily on toes and fingers. Taking benadryl, pepcid, zyrtec and advil. Have seen my primary and allergist. Have an appointment with a neurologist, the wait is long. Is it realistic to think the burning, needle pricking and numbing will totally go away with time?\u00a0\u00a0I'm in the process of three spinal steroid injections in my back and it seems that the shots increases the intensity of these symptoms. Is that possible? Thank you for your time.",
