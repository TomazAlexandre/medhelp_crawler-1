            "answer": "Hi and welcome,I'm not sure if you are aware that this forum doesnt have dr's answering questions, but is made up of people in the process of dx or dx with MS. Not being a dr had me googling and wiki actually had a very detailed exerp on polyneruopathy.Polyneuropathies can be classified in different ways, such as by cause, by speed of progression, or by the parts of the body involved. Classes of polyneuropathy are also distinguished by which part of the nerve cell is mainly affected: the axon, the myelin sheath, or the cell body.Distal axonopathy, or \"dying-back neuropathy\", is the result of some metabolic or toxic derangement of neurons. It is the most common response of neurones to metabolic or toxic disturbances, and may be caused by metabolic diseases such as diabetes, renal failure, deficiency syndromes such as malnutrition and alcoholism, or the effects of toxins or drugs such as chemotherapy.They can be divided according to the type of axon affected: large-fiber, small-fiber, or both. The most distal portions of axons are usually the first to degenerate, and axonal atrophy advances slowly towards the nerve's cell body. If the cause is removed, regeneration is possible, though the prognosis depends on the duration and severity of the stimulus. People with distal axonopathies usually present with sensorimotor disturbances that have a symmetrical \"stocking and glove\" distribution. Deep tendon reflexes and autonomic nervous system functions are also lost or diminished in affected areas.Myelinopathy, or \"demyelinating polyneuropathy\", is due to a loss of myelin (or of the Schwann cells that make and contain it). This demyelination slows down or completely blocks the conduction of action potentials through the axon of the nerve cell. The most common cause is acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP, the most common form of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome), though other causes include chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), genetic metabolic disorders (e.g., leukodystrophy), and toxins.Neuronopathy is the result of destruction of peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons. They may be caused by motor neurone diseases, sensory neuronopathies (e.g., Herpes zoster), toxins or autonomic dysfunction. Neurotoxins may cause neuronopathies, such as the chemotherapy agent vincristine.Diabetic neuropathy affects all peripheral nerves including pain fibers, motor neurons and the autonomic nervous system. It therefore can affect all organs and systems, as all are innervated. There are several distinct syndromes based upon the organ systems and members affected, but these are by no means exclusive. A patient can have sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy or any other combination.-------------Peripheral neuropathy is a result of damage to the axons or the myelin surrounding the nerves. It can be a result of diabetes or a side effect of certain medications, but is not caused by multiple sclerosis (MS). However, sensory symptoms of MS (such as parasthesias) that are caused by lesions in the central nervous system can closely resemble peripheral neuropathy.see about. com-------------------WOW now i'm confused lol the biggest difference would have to be causation, and their distinct disease diagnostic markers. Basicaly MS = brain and or spinal lesions and Diabetes = inslin and blood sugar levels. MS is central nervous system where as diabetes is more commonly peripheral. Now my brain just bolted out the door in protest so i'll leave it there and hopefully someone else will have a better and simpler answer for you.Cheers...........JJ",

            "answer": "MS is an autoimmune disease that damages the nerves of the central nervous system (CNS) i.e.: the brain and spinal cord.\u00a0\u00a0The damage causes a problem in how motor and sensory signals get received, interpreted or sent within the CNS.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms are likely to appear in areas of the body far removed from the actual site of nerve damage.\u00a0\u00a0Initial symptoms can occur anywhere in the body and be sensory (how it feels) or motor (how you move).Diabetic neuropathy is a secondary disease seen in people with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It damages nerves OUTSIDE the CNS in the peripheral nervous system.\u00a0\u00a0It is thought to develop when high blood sugar levels damage blood vessels, including the tiny microvascular system that supplies and nourishes nerves.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms appear in the same general area as the damaged, poorly functional nerves.\u00a0\u00a0People with diabetes often experience sensory loss in their feet as the initial indication of diabetic peripheral neuropathy but multiple motor and autonomic symptoms are also potential problems (that's the \"poly\" part).I hope that helps to sum it up a little.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Are you afraid you might have MS?\u00a0\u00a0If you can to tell us a little more we might be able to help you sort it out a little before you check with your doctor.Hoping you can get a handle on whatever is ailing you - and soon!Mary",

            "answer": "Hi thank you for your answer. I have diabetes type 1 for 30 years. I have been diagnosed with polyneuropathy and arthritis recently. I am experiencing a lot of pain. in my lower back,shoulders hips and neck. I have many nuerological symptoms too. Tingling, numbness muscle twitching, weakness in arms and legs etc. the doctor cannot explain why I get the odd dizzy spell when everything is spinning for about 4 mins and also I get severe weakness and heavy feeling in my arms lasting about 3 mins. I was worried about MS at first but I think it is polynueropathy, the symptoms are quite similar. Also the treatment is the same I am taking anti epileptic drugs. I have also read that there is a link between Diabetes and MS. they are both autoimmune disorders.",
