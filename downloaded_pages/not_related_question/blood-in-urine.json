            "answer": "thanksThe CT and ultrasound found nothing unusual. I had a cystoscopy and prostrate examination this week - and again the urologist found nothing.The blood in urine stopped a week ago now. The urine seems to have returned to normal although, depsite all the water I am drinking it is still quite yellow (not dark yellow).However since then I have had a few stomach problems and periods of dizziness particulary after I eat, and sometimes accompanied by a difficulty swallowing. I wondered whether this could be something to do with the liver - but the blood tests of 10 days ago seemed to indicate the liver was ok.I am seeing the Kidney specialist tomorrow to discuss a blood and urine test of yesterday\u00a0\u00a0and will discuss the creatinine",

    "question": "hi, I am a 36 yr old male. I have had arthritis in my shoulder for several months. Had an op 3 weeks ago. Prior to that and immediately after I was on anti-inflamatory drugs for 4 months (plus pain killers). 10 days ago I noticed I had blood\u00a0\u00a0in my urine - it may have been brown prior to that for a while. I stopped the medications and went to hospital. They gave me an ultra-sound and CT scan of the abdomen- both found nothing. I have had 3 blood and urine tests - all indicate blood in urine (with occasional clots) but no other abnormalities, no protien and full kidney functioning. I have a vericus vein in my left testicle that I had checked 3 years ago but no treatment. That testicle has started hurting. I have inspected and found no lumps.The hospital tell me that it is probably the anti-imflams that have done damage but they are not certain. I have to drink lots of water and see the urologist next week and may have an inspection of my bladder.The bleeding is not painful but is obviously very worrying and I just want some idea. Hope you can advise",
