            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.I am sorry but I will not be able to provide you with much of an answer. I am just not sure what you mean by cerebellar degeneration. Cerebellar degeneration can have multiple causes include metabolic (e.g., alcohol abuse), inherited (e.g., Friedreich's ataxia), and tumor related (aka paraneoplastic syndrome), to name a few. Depending on the cause, the prognosis will change. If it is a progressive disorder, it may/will get worse with time; however, some will remain stable or improve if the offending agent is stopped. Treating complications (e.g., diabetes, falls, infections, etc) that may arise is also necessary.I suggest you discuss the diagnosis with your physician. He/she will be able to provide you with the best answer to your question.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
