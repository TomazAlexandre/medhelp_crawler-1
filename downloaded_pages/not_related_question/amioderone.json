He was taking it since/ // April 24 /for 2 weeks/ and became extremely week /barely can get to the bathroom/ and desoriented. His cardiologist claims that it is not side effect from this medication.

We saw his internist today, he doesn't now for now what it is, but had us sent to blood test to check potassium levels. My husband has diabetes a takes many medications. What shall we do?",
