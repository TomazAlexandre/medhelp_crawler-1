    "question": "I am a 51 year old white male.\u00a0\u00a0For the last 5 days or so my the balls of my feet have been burning and tingling.\u00a0\u00a0My legs also feel week on occasion.\u00a0\u00a0I take no medication and consider myself in decent physical shape.\u00a0\u00a0Generally I walk on average 2 to 3 miles per day.\u00a0\u00a0My height is 6'1\" and my weight is approx. 220.\u00a0\u00a0I do not smoke, but I do chew.One week ago I experienced heart palpitations which turned into an irregular heartbeat.\u00a0\u00a0This lasted for about 24 hours.\u00a0\u00a0I had experienced a couple bouts with heart palpitations over the past 3 years, but they lasted only for an hour or so.\u00a0\u00a0When I first had the palpitations, I had an EKG done and it was normal.\u00a0\u00a0 Since the last bout with with the palpitations and irregular heartbeat, I have discontinued the intake of caffeine.\u00a0\u00a0 So in the past week I have had no recurrence.I am wondering if the feet and heart have a connection.\u00a0\u00a0I, of course, am hoping that is not the case.I am not a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I checked my sugar yesterday on my mother's machine and the reading was 83.I do have, and have had for years, a sore spot in the center of my lower back and have some minor tingling in my feet before, but none to this extent.Your professional opinion is sincerely appreciated.",
