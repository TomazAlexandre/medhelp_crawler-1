It sounds great if it's covered.That being said, the thought of having another site to wear and worry about changing has me thinking I'm going to run out of comfortable skin space real quick.Not interested at this point.",

I have a hard enough time rotating the single site and trying to sleep and stay active. When they can incorporate both technologies together in one site, I'm in. Until then I'll keep squeezing blood out of my fingers and keep my other fingers crossed for a stem cell breakthrough :)",
