    "question": "My father has just had an abdominal CT done that showed a neoplasm with a diameter of about 3.5 cm (1.4 in) in the tail of the pancreas.\u00a0\u00a0The CT interpretation calls for further investigation and describes the mass as having undefined borders and the fat tissue around it as having elevated density (not sure about the terminology, this is my poor attempt to translate from German, since the test was done in Austria).\u00a0\u00a0He is 65, has no other relevant symptoms as far as we can tell, but we are all very scared it might be cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Can you please tell me how likely that is.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
