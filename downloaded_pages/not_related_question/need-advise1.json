            "answer": "I somewhat understand what your daughter is facing. I am 19, and have been a Type 1 for about a year. I'm on an insulin pump. I didn't take care of myself for a while, because I didn't care. I started college and joined a fraterinity. I started drinking excessively. I had a sit down talk with myself and decided what I wanted to do, and I changed my ways. I don't know what pot does to you, I have smoked twice since I have been diagnosed, but more as a social thing. I would just let your daughter live it out, and explain to her that you care. Also, that uncontrolled sugar levels result in an uncontrolled lifestyle. I will say that living under such a disease for so long, I could see how people coudl get burnt out.Robbie",

            "answer": "Im 28 now I got diabetes when I was 11. And things have not been the same since. My family is very critical towards me mainly because of my diabetes. They were constantly on my back and case more about my diabetes than just me as a person. And I have found that people in gerneral are like tha.\u00a0\u00a0To this day when I talk to a family member the first thing they do is got through what I call THE LIST. Are you working out. How is your blood sugar. Are you watching what you eat. Then the lechuring. You know you should do more of this and that. And this is a serious disease.Some times I wouldn't care about takeing care of myself just because its there all the time. When its a constant reminder and then you have people on your case all the time you start to just not care. I got so mad because I was haveing my disease constantly thrown in my face and no one was addressing the real issue. Me. I wasnt ok I wanted some one to talk with me not talk to me. I didnt want some one\u00a0\u00a0telling me all the do's and don't.\u00a0\u00a0I know them.\u00a0\u00a0Look\u00a0\u00a0I know your worried but please make sure your not makeing the same mistake. Let her be moody with out constantly asking is your blood sugar low. Alot of people make that mistake. I may be diabetic but im also human and I have feeling. Including acassional moodyness. Hope this help change your prospective.",

            "answer": "The two previous posters gave great advice. The alcohol and pot may be an attempt to mask more serious depression issues OR they could be just her way of trying to fit in with a crowd of friends who are acting out. I think the most important thing you can do is to try to mend your relationship with her. One book I read about parenting teens said to PICK YOUR BATTLES. Some things are OK to allow her to do even if you don't think they are wise. The health issue is extremely serious and I know you are worried. But instead of going after that issue first, maybe it is time to have a mom-daughter special day or evening just to hang out together and discuss life. Your bond with her is the most important thing you can work on now. Then, when she is approachable, you can bring up your concerns. I would suggest that you try hard to avoid pointing fingers, but more, let her know what worries you. As in counseling, it is probably more effective to use \"I feel...\" comments in your discussion. It could go something like: \"I love you so much, and am so proud to see you growing up. I know it drives you nutty, but I worry when I don't think you are taking care of yourself. Is there anything I can do to help you make the most of your health?\"You might be surprised. She might offer some suggestions about ways to support her. Denial is very common among kids at this age. You as mom are probably her main support, so the most important thing is to try to keep the communications open. It may be helpful to see a family counselor to get some help. She may be more open to a counselor than to having a frank discussion with her parents alone.",

            "answer": "thank you so very much for your responseto be very honest, i had never really thought of things the way you have described them but boy oh boy do i do just as you said. I think i spend so much time worrying about her that i really\u00a0\u00a0didnt think i was doing wrong. She is a person and she is a person living with diabetes, she is not diabetes. I dont know if that made sense but it does in my head.Again I want to thank you, you have opened my eyes....now all I can do is try to keep my eyes open and hope that i can keep them open. It would hurt me to no end to think she thought the same way you do and the sad part is she probably does.Yake care of yourselfwooriedmum69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0:)",
