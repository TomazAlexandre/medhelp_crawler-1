            "answer": "Hi,I think you may be having either some nerve or muscle problems related to your diabetes. Given that you have had it for a long time, the risk is higher in your case than someone who has had it only a few years. Your sugar levels are not too bad right now. Please have your doctor examine your hands/fingers soon to determine if there is any infection firstly, and then for nerve or muscle problems that can give you this type of pain. I am sorry I could not offer more specific advice but I am quite limited by not being able to examie you.Take care.",
