            "answer": "Hi Ms Turner,You are dealing with quite alot, but hang in there.In regard to the PAD testting, it should definitely be done, especially if you are considering surgery in the future. It may be part of your pre-operative tests, as should some cardiac testing. The testing for PAD is non-invasive so there is no reason not to do it--the information can be quite useful.That said, your symptoms may not be from PAD but instead from nerve damage, so nerves testing may also be useful for you. If you are experiencing a great deal of discomfort, speak with your doctors about some of the medications used for diabetic neuropathy(once they are sure this is the cause of your symptoms).Bariatric surgery is quite an undertaking. It has many benefits but is a major surgery and requires a life-long commitment to changing eating habits, so be sure that you have gone over all aspects of the surgery AND life afterwards with your doctor.Hang in there and take a deep breath. Take comfort in your family and friends, and your religious affiliations if any. You can do this.Write as often as you need to, we will be here.take care.",
