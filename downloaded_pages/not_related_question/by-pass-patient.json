            "answer": "The Lipitor, coreg and lisinopril are all medications that had been shown to improve mortality in patients with heart dysfunction like your husband's. If he feels worse two years after the bypass surgery, it may be time to have a repeat heart catheterization to make sure that the bypass grafts are not occluded. If the bypass grafts are all still open, or did not have severe lesions on them, the only or other therapy that has been shown to improve functional capacity and to decrease mortality is a special type of pacemaker defibrillator combination called a BiV device. You should not focus too much on the number given to the heart function, because that does not always correlate with functional capacity.",

    "question": "My husband (age 46) suffered a heart attack in 2006. The cardiologists told us that based upon the damage to his heart, they thought he'd had multiple heart attacks without ever knowing it.\u00a0\u00a0He was also diagnosed with diabetes for the first time.\u00a0\u00a0His heart function was as low as 8%.\u00a0\u00a0They at first did not want to operate, but after administering meds they determined that it was safe enough to do a high risk bypass.\u00a0\u00a0My husband ended up with 6 bypasses.\u00a0\u00a0He feels worse now than he did prior to the bypasses.\u00a0\u00a0At his last cardiologist appointment, his heart function was still low at 25%.\u00a0\u00a0He is growing increasingly tired and it's getting to the point where he doesn't know how much longer he will be able to continue working.\u00a0\u00a0He's discussed this with his cardiologist, but he doesn't seem concerned.\u00a0\u00a0He just adjusted his meds.\u00a0\u00a0He's currently on Lipitor, Coreg, Lisinipril to name a few.\u00a0\u00a0Do you think that with time these meds will improve his condition or do you think that we should ask the cardiologist about other forms of treatment.\u00a0\u00a0I'm at a loss.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what do do.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe we just haven't given it enough time.\u00a0\u00a0This really stays on my husband's mind constantly.\u00a0\u00a0He thinks that he isn't going to get any better and that he is going to die sooner rather than later.",
