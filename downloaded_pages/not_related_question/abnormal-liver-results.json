I have always been monitored every 3_4 months with blood work and he put me on this lipitor 7/11 and I complained about the ide effects and he still increased it in 10/11 because he didn't see liver damage to 80mg from 40mg along with the 200mg of fenofibrate. Now it show enzymes have increased 3/5/12 and then 3/12/12 they have doubled if I went by his word and waited another 3_months to see him I wonder what would have happen then I am so glad I took my friends advice and went to another Dr and that I also met you.. can you please advise me what to do and not do",
