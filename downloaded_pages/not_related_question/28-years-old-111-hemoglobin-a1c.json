I find myself having to urinate a little more often than usual (I attributed this really to drinking more at work but it's a quick onset of an urge to go. I have no incontinence issues or anything like that). I've noticed some difficulty in getting and maintaining strong erections as well...these things have led me to thing they must be correlated with my A1c level or my borderline high blood pressure.So far I've just been focusing on losing weight and planning on stepping up my exercise before deciding to go on meds for any of this.",

            "answer": "Hi Pete and welcome. First of all what you should do is take a deep breath. Diabetes is a lot to adjust to, especially when you are so young and don't expect illness. I won't tell you there isn't a lot to learn, there is, but the good news is that once you learn it, diabetes is a very manageable condition. You just have to get into the right habits. First of all, your fear about insulin is way premature. Type 2 diabetes is a condition where your body produces enough and sometimes even an excessive amount of insulin, but you have insulin resistance so you can't use that insulin too well. While, over time, Type 2's do cease production of insulin and may have to begin taking insulin shots if you work at controlling your diabetes now that could be decades in the future.So how do you do it? You are on the right track with a plan for weight loss and increased exercise. Simplygetting down to a healthy weight (not saying that is simple to do!) can dramatically lower your blood sugar. You also need to learn about what foods spike your blood sugar and to do that you need to test. There are certainly some foods that are known to be high in carbs that will raise most people's blood sugar (potatos, pasta, cereal, bread, sweets) but it is also individual. Try a particular food and then test two hours later. You want to be under 140. If you are higher than you either can't eat that food or can't eat that portion of that food.As far as focusing on just diet and exercise before going on meds: Talk to your doctor. An A1C of 11 is extremely high. (A good goal is below 6.5). Start testing to see what your blood sugar is on a regular basis. Any amount of time spent over 140 is what can lead to complications and you have a lot of years ahead of you that you want to be healthy for. Chances are you've been diabetic for awhile and with an A1C like that you've already spent some time way too high. So you want to get it down quickly. My personal advice would be to start on some meds now and get your numbers down. Then in time, with weight loss, exercise and changed eating habits you may get under control and find you can cut down the meds or even go off them. It might depend how low carb you can tolerate. But you do want to get those numbers down out of the stratosphere.",

            "answer": "Hi Pete,Zoela's advice is excellent.\u00a0\u00a0I agree that you want to be getting that HA1C way down (< 6.5 and ideally close to 5) however possible.\u00a0\u00a0If this includes meds, so be it.\u00a0\u00a0With change in weight and excise the need for meds may also reduce over time.Early days yet.\u00a0\u00a0Don't freak!\u00a0\u00a0Get educated.\u00a0\u00a0It is perfectly possible to get this under control.Cut the refined sugar viciously.\u00a0\u00a0Particularly soft drinks, breads, cakes, etc. This site has trackers for diabetes and meals.\u00a0\u00a0These can be very useful as you start monitoring and getting control of this.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the input so far. So far today I've had a bacon/egg/cheese croissant from Dunkin' Donuts this morning (I never eat donuts anymore) and a large iced coffee with Splenda. For lunch I'm trying a cup of yogurt and some cream of mushroom soup. My stomach feels weird today and I feel tired..not sure if my blood sugar is spiking from just what I had this morning or what.I drink no sugar soda, diet for decades. I try not to eat a lot of sugar when I can. I can say in the past month I did have 2 really bad things that I know were horrendously high in sugar, a Sonic icee thing twice on two different occasions. Needless to say i won't be having that anymore.I've cut out any sweet Starbucks drinks, (tough the gf works there lol) and usually just have a Splenda-added unsweetened passion tea etc.I'm going to try and plan an appt to my father's diabetic specialist who is really really good. I guess my biggest worries are if there are side effects to the medicines they may recommend etc.",

            "answer": "Hi Pete,you need to get yourself a blood sugar test kit and start monitoring 2 hours after eating so you can see the effects of foods, and which foods you need to avoid or strictly portion control.Great that you are getting in to see a specialist.Mostly the side effects of diabetes meds are minimal.\u00a0\u00a0Metformin is usually first line treatment, and have some stomach effects at the beginning, but these normally disappear once your body is used to the drugs.\u00a0\u00a0THe side effects are far less than the complications of high blood sugar - which can kill.Diet wise, eat heaps of green leafy vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0keep the fruit portions minimal.\u00a0\u00a0I'd be looking up info on low carb diets, which I believe are the way to go with diabetes (not the American Diabetes Association higher carb recommendations).Let us know how you go.",

Cardio (walking, jogging) is good, but you must hit the weights and get more muscle once you start losing the fat. I'm down about 20 lbs, and feeling good. You need to stay away from sugars and carbs, and eat veggies, whole grain wheat, and rarely have fruits. Chicken, fish, oils, and lots of veggies. Eat oatmeal or eggs in the morning, and get to about 1800 calories per day intake, otherwise you will end up on the meds. It's hard to start eating and living healthy, but you need to if you want to stay away from the meds. you will lose the weight fast but you also need to tone up and get more muscle. Good luck!",

    "question": "Hi everyone. My name is Pete and I'm new to the site/forum. I recently had a company-paid-for wellness screening. They did an array of blood tests and I wasn't too thrilled with the results. The most distressing of the batch was my Hemoglobin A1c...which was 11%...Some background:I'm 28 years old and have been fairly healthy. My blood pressure has been borderline and in the past year I've lost about 28 pounds and are down to around 264 now. I try to eat fairly well and only really eat out maybe once or twice a week. I don't get too much exercise besides what I do at work, (which involves a lot of walking around but nothing too athletic really). My father is a Type-II diabetic who got his when he was something like 48 years old. Neither my brother, sister or mother have it but I know diabetes runs in my father's side of the family.Needless to say I'm kind of freaking out a little bit because I really don't want to go down the road of having to take insulin or becoming a full-blown insulin-dependent diabetic. What can i do to lower my A1c levels???",
