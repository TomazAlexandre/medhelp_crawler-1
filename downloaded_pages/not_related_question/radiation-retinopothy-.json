            "answer": "Depends on the location of the radiation.\u00a0\u00a0If it was closer to the left eye and the right eye was less exposed to radiation, you hopefully do not develop it.\u00a0\u00a0Radiation retinopathy can continue to progress for a few years after radiation has stopped though so you want to make sure both eyes are checked regularly by your retina specialist.\u00a0\u00a0Also make sure you do not have diabetes or high blood pressure or if you do, make sure they are well treated as both can make retinopathy much worse.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.HV",
