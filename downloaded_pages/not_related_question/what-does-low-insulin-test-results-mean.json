            "answer": "Hello Nikki,Having acanthosis nigricans is a marker of insulin resistance as you said, but this can develop later. Those levels were normal(normal c-peptide and normal glucose levels), although a glucose challenge may also provide some information regarding more subtle issues with glucose handling.\u00a0\u00a0Based on those test results and his family history etc I think he will need close monitoring and repeat testing at regular intervals to get a handle on any abnormalities before they start affecting his growth. You seem to be on top of everything, so I am sure you will ensure he gets the best care.Take care.",

            "answer": "Hello NIkki,I think it is best to have atleast one consultation with a pediatric endocrinologist, so that the intervals for testing etc can be discussed. I am more in the adult realm so I am not what the best intervals are in your situation. Insulin resistance itself may not affect your son's growth in terms of height\u00a0\u00a0etc. but associated diabetes or other glucose abnormalities can affect growth and development overall, as well as weight, energy etc. So it is best to speak with a peds endocrinologist to get the necessary information.Take care.",
