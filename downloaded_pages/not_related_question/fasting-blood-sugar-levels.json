            "answer": "HHi Sally,It looks like you are doing\u00a0\u00a0good job of trying to optimize your health prior to trying to become pregnant,and that is definitely to\u00a0\u00a0be commended.\u00a0\u00a0A fasting of 100 mg/dL is just on the borderline of slight abnormality(impaired fasting glucose), as are your post-meal levels in the 150's(impaired glucose tolerance).I do suggest repeating the glucose tolerance test\u00a0\u00a0prior to trying to become pregnant, and also continuing to try to lose some weight. Regardless of the results of your glucose test, you should continue to keep an eye on your blood sugars during your pregnancy because you are at higher risk of developing gestational diabetes given your history. You will stil need to gain adequate weight to nourish your baby, but you should aim for about 25-30 pounds during the pregnancy and not too much over that, so that you can limit your chances of having abnormal glucoses during the pregnancy.Hope this helps. Good luck and take care!",

            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for answering my question a month ago.My FSB have continued to rise, this morning was 125 (and I have been having a very difficult time maintaining my weight, despite an increase in thyroid meds).\u00a0\u00a0I have also been having massive sugar cravings (to the extent that I want to - though don't - just eat sugar out of the packet straight).\u00a0\u00a0If I start eating candy I have a hard time stopping (so i try to avoid it altogether). Also not good for weight management.I called my\u00a0\u00a0Doctor and he recommended a 75gOGTT, which I will do soon.He has recommended I start taking metformin in any case.\u00a0\u00a0Assuming I don't yet have diabetes (I will continue to try to lose weight, I exercise nearly daily - am just starting my new triathlon season), is it a good idea to use metformin prophylactically?\u00a0\u00a0I haven't started yet and won't till after the OGTT.My life is quite stressful and I travel a lot.\u00a0\u00a0Could this also contribute to the rising blood sugars?Thank you so much.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry for all the questions.Sally",

    "question": "Hi,I am 37 yo female with PCOS & hypothryoid.\u00a0\u00a0Treated only for Hypothryoid, no treatment for PCOS. I have not been diagnosed with diabetes, I am about 20 lbs overweight. I exercise daily.When Dr. checks my FBS in clinic, it is usually around 80.\u00a0\u00a0However, when I check it at home just after waking up, it is usually close to 100 (just over or just under).\u00a0\u00a0I guess it goes down once I start moving around.Is a FBS of 100 a concern?\u00a0\u00a0I am also concerned because I would like to try to have a baby soon and realise this may be an issue.\u00a0\u00a0My maximum blood sugar after eating goes up to about 150.I have had glucose tolerance tests twice in the past few years, but both times had a relatively flat to negative curve (ie. 1 hr slightly raised compared to fasting, but 2 hr & 3 hr results are usually lower than the fasting level).Is all this ok?\u00a0\u00a0Is there any other test to request that would give a better picture of what's happening with blood sugar.Thanks.Sally",
