            "answer": "The GGT can indeed be indicative of liver disease.\u00a0\u00a0The ultrasound is a good idea - and should rule out most of the more serious liver diseases.\u00a0\u00a0I would also consider blood tests looking for hepatitis.If the liver tests are negative, you can consider serially monitoring the GGT.\u00a0\u00a0There are other non-liver diseases that can raise the GGT, including pancreatic disease, myocardial infarction, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and alcoholism.These options can be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

    "question": "I recently had a blood test done, and the results for one area were abnormal.\u00a0\u00a0The reading for GGT was 164.\u00a0\u00a0The CDT Interpretation was normal.\u00a0\u00a0SGOT(AST) was 23 and SGPT(ALT) was 29, both which are normal.\u00a0\u00a0So all of the liver tests except the GGT were normal.\u00a0\u00a0I was instructed to not drink any alcohol and return in 3 weeks for a test.\u00a0\u00a0I returned and another test was done.\u00a0\u00a0This time GGT was 177.\u00a0\u00a0I was told this is usually an indication of high alcohol consumption i.e. alcoholism.\u00a0\u00a0I would classify myself as a mild/social drinker, averaging 5 drinks per week.\u00a0\u00a0Physical exam of liver showed no abnormalities.\u00a0\u00a0Sonagram was done, and test will be ready next week.\u00a0\u00a0I was told to not drink any alcohol for next 2 months and return for another blood test.\u00a0\u00a0Going without any alcohol for last 4 weeks has not been a problem.My question is how significant is 164/177 GGT reading when normal is 0-64?\u00a0\u00a0Seems off the charts to me!\u00a0\u00a0After 3 weeks without any alcohol, wouldn't that be long enough to get rid of any affects in the liver?\u00a0\u00a0If not, how long does that take?\u00a0\u00a0If after two months without any alcohol, the GGT is still high, what would be your prognosis?\u00a0\u00a0Isn't the CDT a better indicator of alcholism than GGT?\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible to just have a normally high GGT level such as mine?\u00a0\u00a0Out of the 20 areas test on the blood sample, the only area abnormal was the GGT.\u00a0\u00a0What are your thoughts on this?Thanking you in advance.",
