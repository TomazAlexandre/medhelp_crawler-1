            "answer": "Seeing a neurologist is reasonable. Fasciculations can be benign or signal a serious neurologic condition. Based on your history you have been experiencing these for at least 5 years, and have not described weakness being associated with these, that is encouraging. By seeing a neurologist, what you are calling fasciculations can be examined by the doctor and confirmed. If appropriate the doctor may perform and EMG to assess the muscle and nerve function. You may also need to have a MRI scan performed depending on what the neurologist finds. Good luck.",

    "question": "Hey everyone, I'm 20/m and ever since about the 9th grade (15 years old) ive had bad cramps and fasciculations (twitching) in my feet when in a relaxed state, which I've heard to be fairly common. As of late (the past 3-4 months?)I have started to notice fasciculations all over the body regularly. Mostly mytoes, legs and arms, but also in my neck, face, certain muscles in the back of my arms, on the top of my arms, and sometimes my neck will feel a little jerky, like a wobble from left to right as well. Occasionally I will feel a sharp pain in thebottom of my right foot which will cause a more extreme twitch in that leg. I've read past posts and it seems most fasciculations dont sound like a serious problem with no past Neurological history. Should I see a neurologist based on these symptoms alone?I have noticed though, some of these symptoms may be linked to Diabetes (or at least i've noticed many people with these same symptoms have Diabetes.) I have not been tested for Diabetes, is this something I should have done or just mere coincidence? Lastly, I really don't stress too much about anything, (I'm only 20!) I exercise 3-4 times a week by running, but could this still be a lack of nutrition and if so, is there something more i should be eating to weaken these fasciculations?Thank you very much for your time and energy on this messageboard, it isgreatly appreciated.Ryan",
