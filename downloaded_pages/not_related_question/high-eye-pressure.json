            "answer": "People ask me this all the time and usually my general answer is \"that is the way God made you.\"\u00a0\u00a0In some cases the high pressure can be due to corticosteroid use (shots, pills, nasal spray, eyedrops, creams.\"\u00a0\u00a0In other cases, it can be due to previous eye trauma causing damage to drainage system, or to an expanding cataract and narrowing of the drainage angle.\u00a0\u00a0In real chronic open ange glaucoma - the elevated pressure is usually due to genetic and other multifactorial influences (diabetes, hypothyroidism, family history, race - especially African American just to name a few.)\u00a0\u00a0As far as trying to make your pressure better on your own through natural methods - about all I've even seen is a few studies showing exercise might help a small amount and possibly weight loss might have a very small impact as well.\u00a0\u00a0By the way 30 is very treatable - I've seen it many times and no \"events\" but it can cause damage over time and needs to be controlled.\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck.Michael Kutryb, MDMichael Kutryb, MD",
