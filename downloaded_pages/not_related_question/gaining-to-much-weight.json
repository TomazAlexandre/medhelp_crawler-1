            "answer": "I gained weight way too fast in my first pregnancy and as a result ended up with gestational diabetes and preclampsia. But this pregnancy im being way more responsible. I sought out a diet plan for pregnant moms and follow it. Its very specific. Tells you exactly what things to eat and at what time. It help me lose weight while pregnant. I also recommend walking daily 30 min or more. And eat 5 to 6 small meals a day atleast 2 to 3 hrs apart. That will speed up your metabolism to help burn the extra calories and cravings off. AVOID GIVING IN TO CRAVINGS especially for your first or last meal of the day. The best time to cheat is at lunch time.",

            "answer": "Work out! Get on an elliptical! They are low impact but give the most effect!Watch your calorie intake. It's so easy to snack and keep eating without realizing just how many calories are in your food.Gaining too much weight, or gaining weight too quickly can be detrimental to both you, and your baby.And this is coming from someone who gained 60lbs first pregnancy.I'm 21 weeks into my second, and have only gained 5lbs because I eat at my pre preg maintenance calories (until 3rd trimester, add 3-600 cals) and still workout.I use the elliptical for at least 15 minutes every night, plus I weight lift to prepare for labor.",

            "answer": "Talk to your doctor.Keep a log if you can of what you eat and when you eat.How did you eat and what did you eat before pregnancy.Rapid weight gain can be indicative of something physiological like thyroid, diabetes etc. The obvious might seem that you are just eating too much because you are pregnant but it could be metabolic...or you might be deficient in some nutrient or vitamin or mineral and your body is sending you a message to search for that thing you're missing in your diet. In today's society most people do not get the proper balance in their diet.By the way pre-eclampsia has a much more complex etiology or cause than overeating. It is not entirely known what causes it but is linked more likely to genetics and proper formation of the placenta and blood vessels. Talk to your health care professional for further advice and help.",

Pregnancy meal plan might be good. Or really talk to your doc if your concerned. It's not really abnormal to gain a lot of weight, they just like to keep an eye on ya if you are bc its a factor in other issues with the pregnancy",
