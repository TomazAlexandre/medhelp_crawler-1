            "answer": "When you say ED I assume you mean erectile dysfunction?Stress is a big contributor to ED.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't wake up with erections I'd be more worried about an organic problem other than stress.When you say blue balls, you mean you orgasm without ejaculation?\u00a0\u00a0If so, no, that's not damaging to sexual function.Corporal fibrosis is unusual without priapism or other organic problems.It's worth looking into more since you don't have erections on awakening.\u00a0\u00a0Consider testing for diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and other problems that can affect the blood vessels.",

            "answer": "No problem with being aroused without orgasm, that's common and would not be damaging.It is not damaging to have an erection for less than 4 hours.The risk of having an erection for more than 4 hours is that the blood can clot in the corpus cavernosum causing a permanent erection",

            "answer": "Hi, I'm a 37 yo male and am experiencing the same problem(s) as you are, apparently.\u00a0\u00a0I should have an appointment with my Urologist this week to check up on what my GP has already checked.\u00a0\u00a0I too am finding the same thing that is happening to you on wakeup.\u00a0\u00a0Have you tried to use Viagra or any of those and if so, what was the outcome?\u00a0\u00a0I've tried and still have the same problem once penetration starts.\u00a0\u00a0Can you please let me know what the results are of your Jan 11th appointment? I'm at my wits end as well because my partner, which is now separated from me, seems to think its all her and our \"chemistry\" when I KNOW it isn't.",

            "answer": "good luck with your urology appointment.you're right, it may not have anything to do with your partner.One concern for both of you is that erectile dysfunction can be a sign of blood vessel problems, due to one of many possible problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or inheritance.\u00a0\u00a0It's worth checking into these possibilities.",

    "question": "Im conitinuing to experience problems with my erections. I have another appointment on Jan 11th but I'm losing my mind and am looking for some possible answers. I'm a healthy 26 year old, I dont smoke,I exercise regularly and barely drink. I sit all day at work and often i find it necessary to stand up to relieve a kind of pressure/pain on my butt.\u00a0\u00a0I dont know if that could be related.\u00a0\u00a0I also had a heavy feeling in my testicles for a while and they hung lower than usual and were usually loose.\u00a0\u00a0The testicle problem seems to have passed but ED still exists.\u00a0\u00a0I had an ultra sound on my bladder/scrotum/and kidneys so far.\u00a0\u00a0He also tested hormone levels and checked my prostate with his finger.\u00a0\u00a0All were fine.\u00a0\u00a0I am totally stressed but this is my main stressor by far.\u00a0\u00a0I don't wake up with erections and if I do they are very weak.\u00a0\u00a0This has been going on for about 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0At the onset I started commuting to the city and sitting all day.\u00a0\u00a0I also started seeing someone at that time.\u00a0\u00a0I did get blue balls two days in a row with her which was painful but the erections werent past the 4 hour danger mark of priaprism.\u00a0\u00a0Can blue balls cause damage to sexual function?\u00a0\u00a0Im concerned about corporal fibrosis but from what I read you can only get that through priaprisms that last for many hours.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas of what the problem could be?\u00a0\u00a0Could general stress cause loss of function, even while sleeping?\u00a0\u00a0Is a more extensive prostate check a good idea?\u00a0\u00a0Do men with corporal fibrosis show any of my symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
