            "answer": "Hi,a reduction from 175 to 140 is good progress.140 fasting still puts you very much in diabetic territory, as ideally fasting will be < 95.\u00a0\u00a02 hours post eating will be < 120.Adding of an insulin sensitising medication such as metformin/ glucophage may be next step.Keep up your great efforts. As you are discovering eating lower carb is very beneficial to management.\u00a0\u00a0When eating low carb you may need to add more protein and healthy fats for energy.\u00a0\u00a0I see you are vegetarian.\u00a0\u00a0Do you still take dairy?\u00a0\u00a0butter / ghee/ cream can all be part of your diet if you do.\u00a0\u00a0Nuts can also be good. Olive, coconut and nut oils can be good.\u00a0\u00a0Use your blood sugar meter to monitor the effects of various foods on your blood sugar and then you can use this to adjust your diet.",
