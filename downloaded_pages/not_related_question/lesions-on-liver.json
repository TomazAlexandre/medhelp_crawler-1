            "answer": "AS surgeon has commented below, there are a lot of lesions that can affect the liver.\u00a0\u00a0The majority of them are benign.\u00a0\u00a0Without further comment on what kind of lesion it is (? mass, ? cyst etc.), it is impossible to say what the next step would be.The ultrasound is the most appropriate step to further define the lesions.\u00a0\u00a0If the lesion is found to be a mass, then further evaluation, including a biopsy may be indicated.\u00a0\u00a0If the lesion is determined to be cystic or a benign tumor (hemangioma or hepatic adenoma), then possible removal can be discussed.If the lesion is fatty liver - then it may be related to alcohol intake or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is primarily treate with weight loss.As you can see, there are plenty of possibilities.\u00a0\u00a0I would take it one step at a time and follow-up with the ultrasound as the next reasonable step.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Thanks,Kevin, M.D.",

            "answer": "\"lesion\" is a very nonspecific term; basically it means \"something.\" It's not at all rare to see \"something\" in a liver; cysts, for example, are very common, and completely harmless. The way to tell if the \"something\" is a cyst is by ultrasound. So your doctors are doing the appropriate thing. Reading about the possibilities without knowing would scare anyone. But, until you know more, the odds are BY FAR that it will turn out to be no big deal. Given your list of meds, labs, and problems, I'd guess you are overweight. I don't want to be presumptuous. But if you are, your best response to your fears for yourself and your family would be to find a way to exercize, eat right, and lose weight.",
