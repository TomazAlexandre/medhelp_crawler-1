            "answer": "Hi,There can be side effects of low blood sugars mainly in you(shakiness, sweating, passing out, seizures) if the sugars go too low(usually below 40mg/dL is the level when most folks have serious side effects like passing out). There is risk of injury to your baby if you fall during a low episode.\u00a0\u00a0But overall insulin is safe for use in pregnancy and has been for many many years. As long as you are under good care and keeping a close eye on your sugars, the risks of poorly controlled sugars are worse then being on insulin, so just keep a close eye on everything and enjoy this time preparing for your little one.take care.",
