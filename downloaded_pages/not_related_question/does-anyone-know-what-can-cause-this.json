            "answer": "There is another kind of diabetes (many now adays) called MODY, mature onset diabetes of the young, there are 6 types, type 2 mody is the most benign, abnormal sugars sometimes after we eat, takes a higher sugar to get the stubborn pancreas to work and then it puts out insulin, not caused by antibodies like type 1 or insulin resistance like type 2, this is a separate genetic thing that is due to miscoding or misprocessing in the islet cell or the many steps that lead to insulin production(put simply since it really is so complex)Mody testing is available and I am seeing more and more kids with this.Keep records of fasting and 2 hour sugar checks, ask your peds endo about MODY testing.Lets see if this is the problem, other concerns include the kidneys and if they are not working well the sugar is not handled well or the urine output is not appropriateHOpe this helps",

            "answer": "start with your pediatrician, explain your concern, collect the information that they need, meaning the blood sugars that you have or are seeing so they can see if he is abnormal. If his sugars checked are not out of range that is great but if they are out of range that triggers your pediatrician to refer you again and consider testing for MOdy or other things.",
