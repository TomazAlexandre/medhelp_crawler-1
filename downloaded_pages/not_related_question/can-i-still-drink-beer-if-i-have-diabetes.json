            "answer": "So with reference to paragraph number 1 in the previous post that \"alcohol makes you do stupid things like taking too much of your medicine (or too little)\", as beer is an alcoholic drink then it would be classed as \"bad\".The best thing to do is to have anything you fancy in moderation.\u00a0\u00a0Don't deny yourself your favourite drink or food.\u00a0\u00a0Have a small portion or as a treat and not every day.\u00a0\u00a0Follow the advice of the Diabetic Association and Government guidelines on alcohol consumption.\u00a0\u00a0You can find advice on alcohol consumption on the Diabetic website confirms what I wrote in my post.Don't drink more than 2 alcoholic drinks in a day.One\u00a0\u00a0alcoholic drink is equivalent to a 12 ounce beer.Drink slowly and only drink when eating food.Having a beer would be better than having a liqueur or sweet wine.",
