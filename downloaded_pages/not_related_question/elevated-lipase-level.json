            "answer": "Here is some information on high lipase levels copied from the health library:*A high lipase level usually indicates inflammation, injury, or blocked drainage of the pancreatic enzymes. Very high lipase levels usually indicate pancreatitis or blockage of the tube (duct) leading from the pancreas to the beginning of the small intestine (duodenum).*\tHigh lipase levels may indicate damage to the pancreas caused by a stomach ulcer that has eroded, or perforated, the wall of the stomach. Stomach acid may then leak into the abdominal cavity, damaging the pancreas.*\tHigh lipase levels can also be caused by cancer of the pancreas, by gallstones, or by blockage of the intestines.Why was the bloodtest done, and what are your symptoms?",
