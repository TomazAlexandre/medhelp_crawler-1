            "answer": "Oh yes I've weighed the good and bad. I've even talked to my OB about it and she even thought it was a fluke the first go around with the GD. But if medical doctors are going to stop testing healthy women due to the test not being completely accurate, I think it's safe to assume that even the doctors are starting to regret testing healthy women. If you don't have it, great. Wonderful. But I choose not to get the test just like I choose to drink coffee and eat chocolate. I know what my body can handle and what it cannot handle. My normal blood sugar number is 65 so I do keep an eye on it but I refuse to starve myself this time around.",

            "answer": "No because I love my children and want them safe & healthy!!! Had the test done with my first 2 pregnancies and will with this one. Every pregnancy & baby is different. Just because you didn't have it with your first doesn't mean it'll be the same this time. So would you refuse the GBS test aswell?? I hope your baby is safe & healthy coz I'm already concerned for it.... There is a very valid reason they do these tests, pretty much every test like this is for the health & safety of both you and baby. People who \"choose\" not too are ignorant...",

            "answer": "Sorry also just realised you are from America, in Australia we have better health care, so with your under 25 statement it's probably just your countries sub standard of healthcare... As too everything \"each to their own\" your choice is your choice. But I wouldn't put my child's life or mine at risk for a slight inconvenious to myself for even 24hrs. Also i am under 25 too but still wouldn't choose not to have a test that is a warning/serious life threatening for both mum & bub diagnosis... Good luck and hope your baby is healthy....",

    "question": "Anyone else going to refuse the glucose test during the 24-28 weeks? I had it with my first little girl without a lot of information and I've never had issues with blood sugar. My levels have always been normal at 50-80. They gave me the test over 24 hours of not eating with the first and, of course, my blood sugar was high by one point. My daughter and myself never had issues after birth and I've eaten only healthy foods with this pregnancy. I've also found out that the American medical society is also going to remove the test for anyone under the age of 25 as they aren't at a high risk with a normal pregnancy. I'm currently 20 so I'm not too worried this time around. I just want to know if there are any other women who are having a normal pregnancy and have no increased risk of diabetes who are refusing it as well?",
