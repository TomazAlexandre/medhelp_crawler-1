            "answer": "Pretty much hit it on the head-First\u00a0\u00a0Doc put it all on Cataracts ( wrong ) had the surgery and lens implant--couldn't read after and torn Retina within a month .:Capsolotomy both eyes--original doc no helpCataract surgery both eyes -- worse than before--much worse and torn and detached Retina within a month.The computer scan showed thick healthy retina ( ay first doc ) yet after Buckle surgery they told my wife that the Retina was thin and ragged.The hospital that did the Buckle diagnosed me with open angle Glaucoma and began aggressive treatment .Glaucoma specialist said that my vision ( down to 20-90 at best--sometimes 20-120 ) was a combination of Diabetis--high blood pressure--sleep apnea and Glaucoma and although I complainedabout severe burning and pain every time he just didnt seem to take it seriously. A resident did a test strip for dry eye and they stuck fast and had to peel them off resulting in a tear--yet the reg doc didn't even post it in notes !!!Vitrectomy for Macular pucker--Laser for lattice degeneration-Laser for suspect spots in both eyes to prevent tears--Laser in Buckle eye for holes around buckle. A visiting doc from a well known Eye Centersaid I had macular edema and needed to revisit with Retina Doc. For some reason my macula sweels up and then goes down for no apparent reason ( I can tell because when it swells the doorways look crooked ) It has been checked with Computer and raised one week and flat the next--they never explained that--you have any thoughts??New Doc\u00a0\u00a07 th one -1. Toxic reaction to Travatan--Kosopt--flushed eyes--warm compresses--discontinued-- all is fine now-- monitoring regularly .2. Diagnosed Kerititis Sicca recommended Celluvisc ( which is the first drops that work for more than a\u00a0\u00a0couple mins. )3. already on Restasis for 8 months with no improvement so we stopped that.4 diagnosed Occular Rosecea and put on Meds ( worked and don't look like I have a hangover all the time--still have bad dry eye but atleast doesn't feel like bee stings all the time )Acuity 20-50 when rested--still gets worse with use.No treatment for high light sensativity .It was explained that the multiple surgerys are probibly responsible for dry eye going from Minor\u00a0\u00a0to severe . Tear gland shut down ( the oil part- have tears sometimes but still bad burning )The light sensativity is a combination of dry eye and all the Laser surgery ( that he confirmed was needed ) .I have read others that have had problems after cataract surgery and feel that some doctors should use more caution and research beforethe surgery-\u00a0\u00a0I am convinced that my original problems were mostlyDry Eye, Glaucoma\u00a0\u00a0and Rosecea\u00a0\u00a0I am sure I had cataracts just not my major problem.ThanksYou mentioned all my issues , except Rosecea , and I am told thats rare and hard to diagnose. Also told that Rosecea adds to dry eye.",
