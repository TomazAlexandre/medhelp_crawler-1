            "answer": "Hi,The best way to see if your symptoms are related to low blood sugars is to test your self when you have the symptoms. Many times people feel symptoms that are typical of low blood sugars but it turns out that the number is not low at all, so you have to check.On your own, you can buy an inexpensive glucose meter from the drug store, check your blood sugars when you wake before eating, then whenever you feel those symptoms. People can feel \"hypoglycemia\" either from a true low number(usually less than 60) or from a fast drop of a high number to normal(for example drop from 160 to 80 in a short time).Hope this helps,take care.",
