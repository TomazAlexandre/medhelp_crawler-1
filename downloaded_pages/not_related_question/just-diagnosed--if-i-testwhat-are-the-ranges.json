            "answer": "Hi,as a guideline the testing times and 'normal' ranges are:Fasting: 70 - 90 (Some will say normal is up to 95)95 - 125 Prediabetes> 125 DiabetesBefore Meals:\u00a0\u00a0Should have returned to fasting numbers (70 - 95)1 Hour post eating: < 140\u00a0\u00a0(though to be truly normal it will be not morethan 10 - 15 above your fasting levels).2 hours post eating: < 120 (Though to be truly normal it will be < 100).To monitor, I would recommend testing your fasting levels a few tiems a week, and your 1.5 - 2 hrs post eating levels after meals at least from time to time.\u00a0\u00a0Write down both what you ate and your recorded blood sugars.Also you can use the post eating results to help guide you on what to eat.\u00a0\u00a0If you are high after a meal, then you change what you eat to lower carb (more non-starchy veges), protein and healthy fats.\u00a0\u00a0This is called \"Eat to your Meter\".Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Please ask if you have more questions.",

            "answer": "In order to get the best information, speak to an endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0They specialize in treating diabetes and can give you the best up to date information.In my own experience, I test first thing in the morning and then about an hour after I eat breakfast or my first meal.\u00a0\u00a0Ill test again before I eat my next meal and then I test before and about an hour after dinner.\u00a0\u00a0when I am in good control of my diet, my levels do not fluctuate much and I have been instructed to keep them as near to 100 as possible.Different people will tell you which levels are best.\u00a0\u00a0You are an individual and you are likely to be more comfortable at a different level than someone else.\u00a0\u00a0For me, If my glucose levels get down to around 80, I start to feel it.\u00a0\u00a0My wife on the other hand doesn't start to feel ill until she gets down to the 60's or 70's.Test often, journal your test results and how you feel at different levels.\u00a0\u00a0that can help you establish a baseline and make you aware of where YOU are comfortable.\u00a0\u00a0Again, I urge you to speak to a professional.",

    "question": "I was just diagnosed pre-diabetic/insulin resistant a little over a month ago. I have several people that said I need to test so I know my norm. It was not mentioned by the doctor. I have no idea when I should test and what the ranges should be. I have seen so many different things on the internet you don't know what guidelines to go with. Any advice would be great. Obviously I will ask my doctor as well but my appointment is a few months away.",
