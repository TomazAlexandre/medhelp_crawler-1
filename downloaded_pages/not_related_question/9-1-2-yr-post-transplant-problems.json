    "question": "I`am 9 1/2 yrs post liver transplant in the past 2 yrs I have had some problems. I have a sort of Ventral hernia around the liver..and now they have found that I have enlarged lymph nodes surrounding my stomach and liver.They periodically flare up with pain.Now I`am on methadone for the pain.This I dont care for much,but is the only thing that helps the pain some.Doctors put me through series of tests & though I had melynoma? Because of the prograff I take..Iam on 1 1/2 mgs twice a day.I am grateful..I only had 6 months to live almost ten yrs ago.My question is..will I end up with Meyaloma or melyinoma..? I know its a guessing game,and just curious how the end will come.Will it come because of the fk prograf? I also fight diabetes,which I never had before the transplant.Now I feel like some junkie on pain killers.What do you think of all this? I`am worried about the future.",
