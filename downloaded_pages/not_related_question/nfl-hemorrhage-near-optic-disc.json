            "answer": "The hemorrhage will not affect cataract surgery risk.\u00a0\u00a0There are many causes of retinal hemorrhage which need to be evaluated:\u00a0\u00a0hypertension, diabetes, use of blood thinners, anemia, leukemia, among others.\u00a0\u00a0If the hemorrhage is very close to the optic nerve, this can be a risk factor for glaucoma.\u00a0\u00a0Again, the hemorrhage per se will not increase the risks of cataract surgery.\u00a0\u00a0It is possible that the cataracts are at the point that they are affecting the retina specialist's view of the retina, and that is the reason for suggesting removal.",

            "answer": "I am confused when people say it can be caused by anemia. I have a genetic blood disorder and at times I experience extreme bouts of anemia called hemolytic anemia. Also, I have been tested for diabetes which I do not have but I do experience regular periods of very low blood sugar. Should I bring up these issues to my Retina specialist?",

            "answer": "I'm very sorry about the problems with your eye health and vision.\u00a0\u00a0Yours sounds like a challenging case and I can understand your concern.Dr. Fazio's comment that the retina specialist may need the cataracts removed so the back of the eye can be viewed also makes sense to me.\u00a0\u00a0Although there are now lots of great imaging techniques for viewing the retina with the advent of OCT, the retina doctor may still want to 'visualize' the retina directly to assess any treatment for your nerve fiber layer bleeding and other retina problems.You should ask the retina doctors why they now feel cataract removal might be worth the risk of cataract surgery in a high myope with existing retina problems.There are certain blood disorders which can definitely affect the retina and bleeding in that area of the eye, so you should DEFINITELY discuss your history with your retina specialist.\u00a0\u00a0You might want to prepare a list ahead of your next appointment detailing the diagnoses and treatment related to your blood disorder, so the doctor can quickly review it and then discuss it with you.In terms of diabetes, it's good that you do not have it.\u00a0\u00a0High blood sugar from diabetes, rather than low sugar levels, is more commonly associated with damage to the eyes.\u00a0\u00a0But you should also mention the low blood sugar issues to your doctor, as well as any other major elements of your medical history.\u00a0\u00a0There might be something else that seems unrelated but could be affecting your eye health.Lastly, be sure to tell your retina doctor and cataract surgeon both about any meds or supplements you take, as some can affect bleeding and there may be some the doctors will want you to stop taking before any procedure.\u00a0\u00a0I with you all the best with your future treatment.",

    "question": "I have a nerve fiber layer hemorrhage in my right eye my retinal specialist wants me to be evaluated for cataract removal surgery for both eyes (I have 3 different cataracts in my left eye and 2 different cataracts in my right eye), I'm only 31 years old and I do not have glaucoma, hypertension or diabetes. What exactly is nerve fiber layer hemorrhage and what are the risks involved with cataract removal surgery? I also have retinal holes and retinal schisis in both eyes and I'm a high myope. One of the reasons I'm asking is because 6 months ago my retina specialist was very against cataract removal surgery but since they have found this hemorrhage there seems to be a sense of urgency to evaluate if they can be removed. It's very alarming and unsettling to me. Any advice or help would be very much appreciated, thank you.",
