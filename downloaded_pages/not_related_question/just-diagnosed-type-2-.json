            "answer": "Hi,I do agree that you should be retested a a few weeks after you are off the steroids as they can\u00a0\u00a0certainly push you over the edge into diabetes territory.In the meantime you are doing good things by revamping your diet which will be good for you anyway in the long run. I do suggest getting your own meter(those simple drug store brands are just fine and a lot cheaper) and trying to check at least twice a day for three days a week so that you have an idea of the patterns involved. Before breakfast and dinner are good places to start. In the meantime until you are able to get back into your doc's office, call them and request a referral to a diabetes education class. This will help give some good general information and ideally also connect you with a nutritionist. There are tons of websites that are also good including the ADA site(www.diabetes.org). Hope this helps, Take care.",

            "answer": "Hey. I don't know that much about D2 except my middle daughter has it - also recently diagnosed. Why is it that you have no guidance? If you are feeling like you got told you have it, and then....nothing...there is something wrong there. Was it a blood test that came back abnormal? I feel bad no one responded to you. I am new to this forum as well, and I find it an absolutely amazing second home! There are no judgements here - we can pour out all our woes and get everything from hugs to great advice and suggestions.A follow up appointment would be a first step, I'd think - just my opinion, but that should have been the first words out of you doctors mouth, like...\"when can you come in and go over this?\" or something. Is there meds involved. I know D2's have to monitor and watch what they eat and all, but someone should be in there telling you all that. If nothing else go to WebMd or google it or something so you aren't out in the lurch with this. Also, on here is a \"Health Topics\" section. Check that out. I don't know what else to tell you, but please don't think no one cares.",

            "answer": "Thanks for responding to my post. Yes my fasting blood test was 134. I recieved a phone call from the office, telling me the docter thinks I'm diabetic , but that she needs to do another test. I'm assuming it is the AC1. I explained to the girl I had just been on steriods for another condition that raises blood sugar and that I would perfer to have the testing done after the steriods are out of my body, for a more accurrent reading. Everything was just left like that. No advice, no future appointments etc... Your right, I need to make an appointment and talk to the doctor, because apparently the medical assistant was just informing me and didn't have any interest in my course of action.In the mean time, I am taking it very seriously and have cut out all fun sugar, such as candy and sweets and have lowered my carb intake. I'm also going to the bookstore and reading everything I can get my hands on.I just tried to get an appointment, but can't get in, and am feeling anxious as to wheather or not I should get a meter to make sure I'm not walking around with high blood sugar, that can be causing accumulative damage.Is your daughter just diet controlled at this time? Does she use a blood glucose monitor?Thanks,Jasmine",
