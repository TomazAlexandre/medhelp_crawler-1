I know with my first baby I had gestational diabetes and felt horrible until I found out I actually had GD and had to change my diet. I didnt feel sick anymore and had more energy. Remember to look for the silver lining. Because of the complications I had with my 1st son, this time around I feel like I can take on anything. You can do this!",
