            "answer": "HI,It sounds like your wife will definitely need an additional medication--if not restarting the Pioglitazone, then an alternative. There are lots of different diabetes medications available that will help. Those glucose levels are indeed too high and should be addressed soon. Please ask your wife to contact her doctor as soon as possible(I suggest within the next 2 days a most) and discuss being started on another medication to bring her levels down.In the meantime she should continue being careful about what she eats, exercise when she can and drink water to stay hydrated.",

Since 2005, she has been taking Duotrol 1/2-0-1/2,& Pioglit15 1-0-0 . But the doctor, seeing her wieght (68kgs) asked her to discontinue Pioglit. Now, since last Sunday(21st of September), we have noticed that the Blood glucose levels have gone past 200.(250,231,222 are the last 3 readings for\u00a0\u00a0 her Fasting levels,281,274 and 250 the reading for\u00a0\u00a0Postprandial) .
