            "answer": "I also wanted to add under my urine dip results my glucose level in my urine is 250 when it should be negative. I am not pregnant and i do not have diabetes... None of these things have EVER been mentioned to me! In the note the er dr wrote to the nurse practioner he wrote \" Urine,pH was 6.0, specific gravity 1.025,250 of glucose, which makes no sense with normal serum glucose and negative for ketones, blood, nitrite and leukocyte esterase. Urine hCG was negative as well\" I just dont understand. Its looking like i have more than one thing working against me.",
