            "answer": "Hello,Herniated discs are one of the causes of polyuria because of pressure and damage to the nerves causing improper bladder control. Also other possibilities need to be ruled out. The primary cause which needs to be excluded is diabetes. I would advise you to get a fasting blood sugar and Hb A1 C test done.If diabetes is ruled out then other possibilities which need to be ruled out are prostatitis(inflammation of the prostate gland),interstitial cystitis,overactive bladder syndrome,stroke and other neurological diseases,urinary incontinence, bladder cancer(rare) and bladder dysfunction .I sincerely hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "Thank you both for your info and advice. I do feel my problem is somehow connected to my herniated disc as it started around the same time. However, I will go to my doctors\u00a0\u00a0and have the diabetes test.You have had the problem for three years Jason? I do hope you eventually\u00a0\u00a0get some relief. Disc pain alone is so exhausting.",

            "answer": "Hi, I have also been suffering from Herinated Disc (L4,5 and S1) along with Pain Urinating (and very slow flow) leading to Frequent Urination for the past 2 years at least. All the doctors that I have seen (urologists, neurologists and general physicians) all seem clueless since I have also had Chronic pain in the Ischial Tuberosis (literally, pain in the butt) accompanied off and on, with pain in my Heels. Doctors think I am a hypochondriac with all these symptoms but I know that aches the started literally a couple of weeks after I first came down with an Acute urinary tract infection and have continued ever since along with my Urinary symptoms. Btw, I am a 40 year old male. Would much appreciate if the original posters or anyone else could suggest any solutions.",

    "question": "Last year I suffered a herniated, compacted disc and a couple of weeks ago the disc slipped again. I now have the urge to urinate every two hours or so even though I haven't had much fluid intake. Could this be a result of the disc maybe putting pressure on my bladder or could it be\u00a0\u00a0from the strain on my body when I move around? I'm also taking\u00a0\u00a0Omeprazole and I have heard frequent urinating could be a rare side effect of that tablet. Can anyone help pease?",
