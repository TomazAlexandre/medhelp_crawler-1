            "answer": "Tearing and trauma can and do cause discoloration.\u00a0\u00a0This has nothing to do with nerve damage or diabetes.I am not sure why your skin is tearing.\u00a0\u00a0Obviously, lubrication is best, but that doesn't seem to be helping.\u00a0\u00a0I think you ought to consult either a dermatologist or urologist (or both) about this.\u00a0\u00a0But again, I see no relationship of what you have with diabetes and no particular significance to the grayish discoloration.Best.Dr. Rockoff",

            "answer": "hey i have diabetes II and i notice that when my sugar has been out of control for a couple of weeks that i get tears in the skin of my penis also. however they normally are vertical with the shaft and not horizontal and go all the way around my penis just below the head then i also get horizotal tears right at the head during sex. once my sugar is back under control for a week or two they go away. so dont let any doctor tell you they are not related to diabetes. i have talked to many men with diabetes and alot of them have this problem even though our doctors tell us it's not the diabetes.",

    "question": "I am a fifty year old male in pretty good health except that I have type two diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with the condition about three years ago.About five years ago I noticed one lobe of the underside of my penis head was greyish in color but there was no loss of sensitivity or discomfort, last year the other lobe of the underside of my penis began losing normal pink tone and is now the same greyish color.\u00a0\u00a0Also about that time I experienced a tearing of foreskin (I am circumsized) where it attaches at the base of my penis head on the underside, during some sexual intercourse sessions.\u00a0\u00a0Now the tearing seems to occur nearly every time my wife and I have sex.\u00a0\u00a0I use K Y jelly which helps but vigorous or prolonged thrusting seems to cause the tear to occur.\u00a0\u00a0It heals in a few days but seems to remain sensitive, possibly since I continue to re-injure it. Also the lobes of my penis head seem more sensitive but that could be from the foreskin injury. One concern I have is that there might be some connection between the type two diabetes and my penis issues.\u00a0\u00a0I have no problems with erectile dysfunction at this point and have no nerve damage to any other parts of my body.\u00a0\u00a0Do you think the two issues of tearing and discoloration are connected in any way?\u00a0\u00a0What could be the cause of the discoloration?\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned that it might be lack of blood flow, although I have no other circulatory issues.\u00a0\u00a0Why is my foreskin tearing?\u00a0\u00a0I am at a loss and afraid of the worst. HELP!!!",
