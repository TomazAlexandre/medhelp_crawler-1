            "answer": "Hi,For many people with Type 2 diabetes this high morning sugar is the first issue with glucose to develop. Normal glucose management involves not only keeping it normal while not eating(the overnight fast) but also after eating(values during the rest of the day).Sometimes one area starts going awry while the other is still okay for the time being. What your pattern suggests is that your body can still keep your post-meal glucose controlled but not the overnight one(when your liver makes glucose for you). With good changes in your diet and exercise patterns and some weight loss, you should be able to get this morning value under control too. Best of luck and take care.",
