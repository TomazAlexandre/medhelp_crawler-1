            "answer": "There are other medications that are quite useful for GAD, so not being able to take benzo class of drugs will not be a problem. But since you are so sensitive to medications, I suggest you meet with a psychiatrist who can go over your medications from the past and find the right one for you now....",

            "answer": "Your diabetologist is an idiot.You have just described the symptoms of autonomic neuropathy to a T.Autonomic neuropathy is very common in diabetes. The symptoms include dizziness, weakness, lightheadedness, hedaches, trouble concentrating, the constatnt feeling that you are going to pass out. Oh, and yes, these symptoms are inconsistant severity. Inconsistant severity is a red flag for an autonomic disorder.I don't know if you have an autonomic disorder, but you need clearly need to be evaluated for one. Please do some research on this disorder and get a second opinion.",

    "question": "Very interesting discussion. I am no stranger to anxiety but am experiencing similar feelings of limb weakness and feelings of being off balance along with neck tension (possible cause of lightheadedness) and the awful feeling like I am going to pass out along with poor concentration and irritability. Recently I have been blaming high blood glucose levels from poorly controlled type2 diabetes but after describing these recent symptoms to my diabetologist she flatly denied that these could be symptoms of diabetes alone and that although some feelings of dizziness could be a symptom she feels that the severity isn't consistant and so is sending me to a sleep lab ...oh well.Here's the question. Are you familiar with the clinical expression \"benzodiazpeine deficiency syndrome\"?I ask because I had been taking .5 Clonazepam for 10 years and it took me 3 years of crippling withdrawal to get back to 75% functionality. So, benzos are not an option and I am sensitive to most drugs now because of the receptor damage (neuroadaption) from withdrawing the drugs too quickly.\u00a0\u00a0If now I have developed GAD then what other options can you suggest to help me get walking again without symptoms?Thanks",
