            "answer": "Hi and thanks for using the forum.You could have the lingering cough for a while.\u00a0\u00a0Since the chest x-ray is normal, then you probably don't have pneumonia.\u00a0\u00a0It is more than likely viral in nature (especially since you have done both courses of antibiotics).\u00a0\u00a0My only other suggestion would be to ask your doctor about a course of steroids.\u00a0\u00a0They could help open up your airway a bit and calm down your cough if indicated.\u00a0\u00a0Also, a nebulizer treatment could help.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and hope you feel better soon.Bridget",

            "answer": "HI,Advair is used for patients with asthma or COPD which it does not sound like you have.\u00a0\u00a0You also need a prescription for it, so I don't think it is a good idea to take it.\u00a0\u00a0Nasonex is prescribed for nasal symptoms related to seasonal allergies.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think that this will help you either.\u00a0\u00a0I think you should ask your doctor about the persistent cough (perhaps it is allergy related) and see what he/she suggests.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.Bridget",

            "answer": "Here is a simple way to find out if your coughing is due to an allergy. Get some liquid\u00a0\u00a0Benadryl. When you start to cough take a sip of it. Wait and take another sip. If the cough stops you have an allergy of some sort. If if eat a food that I am allergic to, I cough. The Benadryl stops it cold. But because I have ingested the allergen I then take a full dose of anti-histamine.",

I have white/clear mucous and have used augmentin and azithromax one course after another (augmentin first and then azithromax) given by my doctor but the cough is not gone.
