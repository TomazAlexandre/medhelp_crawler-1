    "question": "My 'symptoms':- Sleep 7-9 hours every night- Virtually never have trouble falling asleep (usually do within 2-3 mins of turning out the light)- Very deep sleeper (even my phone ringing on my bedside table, or bright sunlight outside, almost never wakes me up)- Virtually never remember dreams- Every day, wake up feeling very groggy. It takes multiple hours for me to feel like I've \"woken up\" and am functioning at full cognitive capacity - even after showering, eating and having coffee. Some days I never really get there, and the groggy / foggy feeling persists all day.- Much more alert and energetic at 10pm than at 10am- Work from 9am~8pm every weekdayI'm 28 years old, and have been this way for many years.\u00a0\u00a0I chalked it up to adolescence, but it's persisted, or if anything gotten worse over the years.\u00a0\u00a0Is this a 'condition'?\u00a0\u00a0Is it just 'not being a morning person'?",
