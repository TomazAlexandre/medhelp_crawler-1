            "answer": "I also was diagnosed with a nodule on my thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0It was found on an mri I had done on my cervical spine that found several herniated discs.\u00a0\u00a0 This was in January 09.\u00a0\u00a0 I then went to an endocrinologist who sent me for an ultra sound.\u00a0\u00a0I told him at the time that I had this feeling of a lump in my throat.\u00a0\u00a0He said I wouldn't be able to feel it and it was probably nerves.\u00a0\u00a0The ultra sound showed a 1.5 cm nodule on the right side and another 4.4 mm one there as well.\u00a0\u00a0There are cysts on the left side.\u00a0\u00a0 I had the fine needle biopsy done and they did not have enough cells to give a definitive diagnosis of benign.\u00a0\u00a0I will be having another ultra sound and biopsy done in early June.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, this feeling of a lump in my throat is driving me nuts.\u00a0\u00a0 Some days it is worse than other days.\u00a0\u00a0I often choke on food and find I have to eat very slowly.\u00a0\u00a0The pain seems to radiate to my right ear as well.\u00a0\u00a0All my thyroid bloodwork has come out normal.\u00a0\u00a0I do have mild diabetes Type 2 that I am controlling with diet an exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Am I nuts, or do I really feel this nodule in my throat on the right side?",

    "question": "Lastfall a ct of my neck showed a growth on my thyroid so a ultrasound was done that show lots of growths 3 of which were big enough to do a needle biospy. The needle biospy did not have enough cells to give an answer I was told to come back in 6 months for repeat ultrasound. My question is does thyroid growths cause pain and swallowing problems? Water is getting struck in my throat alot of times and my throat is hurting like someone is squeezing it. I have about 3\u00a0\u00a0more months to go before repeat ultrasound but should go in sooner? Thanks for any help that you can give me.",
