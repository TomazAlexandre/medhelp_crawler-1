            "answer": "Although you are of young age, I would suggest being evaluated further by a physician (or cardiologist). Chest discomfort that is accompanied with shortness of breath, dizziness is always worrisome (regardless of age). If not done already, basic tests should be performed to rule out causes -- which could represent a condition of the heart, lungs, GI tract, or overlying skin/muscles. CXR, ECG, blood work and a good history and physical would be in order to help differentiate what needs to be done. If there are serious co-morbidities (smoking history, high BP, dyslipidemia, history of diabetes, or family history), further non-invasive studies might be indicated such as a stress test.",
