            "answer": "We live in Connecticut. The doctor that we were referred to suggested that we wait a month & re test her & do a 3 hour glucose test, we are really worried that we should not wait that long.We check her urine at home & even though we know that is not as accurate as checking her blood, it continues to be high.We are willing to travel to get a second opinion to get some answers, because if it diabetes then we need to know what to do & if it is something else we need to know that too.Our daughter also has a big fear of needles & is scared that she does not understand what is going on with her. I don't know that she could handle a 3 hour glucose test.The last time they drew her blood & did a fingerstick it took 5 people to hold her down & they actually had to give her something to sedate her.If you know any pediatric endocrinolgy groups near CT, please let us know, as stated before we are willing to travel a little bit to get some anwsers.Thanks",

            "answer": "one of the best diabetes centers in the country is at Yale New Haven, Dr.William Tamborlane heads it up and is a colleague of mine, would trust him with my own child's life, diagnosis of diabetes in a child especially type 1 diabetes is NOT with an oral glucose tolerance test, insist on seeing a pediatric endocrinologist and only if this advice was from a subspecialist would I wait- her antibodies are measureable but would have to see the normals, the 280 sugar is not normal, the hba1c is elevated, I would still see an endocrinologist, get set up with a team and be followed, lets hope this is nothing.",

    "question": "My 5 year old daughter went to the doctor for a routine checkup for kindergarten. They tested her urine & she had sugar in it. They pricked her finger & it was 280. The next day after fasting it was normal. They ran a hemoglobin A1C test, which came back at 6.7.They think she has the early stages of diabetes, but we are wondering if there are any other tests that can tell if it is definately diabetes?She continues to have sugar in her urine, could there be something else wrong that she is having sugar in her urine other than diabetes?",
