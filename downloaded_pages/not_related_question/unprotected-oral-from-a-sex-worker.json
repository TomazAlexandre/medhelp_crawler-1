            "answer": "Welcome to the forum.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Hook and I take questions interchangeably, irrespective of requests for one of us or the other.\u00a0\u00a0We have been close colleagues for 25 years and our opinions and advice are never significantly different.You are overreacting to a very low risk sexual exposure, and I agree that your symptoms are due primarily to anxiety; and suspect your penile \"bumps\" have nothing to do with the sexual exposure.\u00a0\u00a0(One STD expert calls it the \"guilty penis syndrome\".)\u00a0\u00a0When a person suspects his or her own symptoms have a psychological origin, usually s/he is correct.\u00a0\u00a0In any case, your symptoms don't sound at all like herpes or any other STD.\u00a0\u00a0Herpes doesn't cause tingling, leg aches, etc without also causing overt penile blisters or open sores.Further, oral sex is pretty much safe sex.\u00a0\u00a0The odds of herpes from a single exposure like you describe probably are under one chance in several thousand.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, you might be immune.\u00a0\u00a0Half of all adults have had HSV-1 (the only herpes type that is likely to cause oral infection); if you have had it, you are immune to catching it again, anywhere on your body.\u00a0\u00a0To the specific questions at the end of your post:1) You should not be at all worried about these symptoms.2) Tingling can precede outbreaks of recurrent herpes, but not the initial infection; and when such tingling occurs, it is pretty much in the place where blisters/sores are about to appear -- not scrotum, legs, etc.3) The likely emotional origin of your symptoms is discussed above.4) If the bumps you describe were herpes, they would be red/inflamed and would turn into blisters or open sores within 1-2 days.\u00a0\u00a0Probably you are noticing minor variations in your penile skin that probably have always been there.As for the information in your follow-up comment (below), it doesn't change my opinion or advice.\u00a0\u00a0Having diabetes has no effect on how quickly herpes symptoms or lesions would appear.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms of new herpes or other STDs do not come and go.\u00a0\u00a0Psychological symptoms do.Truly, you should not be worried about this event.\u00a0\u00a0If you remain concerned, see a doctor or clinic in person.\u00a0\u00a0But if I were in your situation, knowing what I know, I would not get tested for any STD and would continue unprotected sex with my wife with no fear for her health.Regards--\u00a0\u00a0HHH, MD",

            "answer": "Dr. HHH, thanks for the quick response.One of the two current bumps is slightly red but is still very small and has been there a day or so now without much change, no pain either.I took an std test with the blood herpes test (can't remember the official name) that said I was negative for both 1 and 2\u00a0\u00a0but they said that there was a 6 month window. This is why I was worried about the possibility. I was negative for all other STD's tested.I had unprotected sex with my long- term girlfriend 2 days after the possible exposure before I realized there was any risk at all. I fear giving it to her most of all and we had protected sex last night.I have read a large amount about the risks and symptoms of herpes so it very well may have lead to me being paranoid to go along with my shame.The diabetic mention was only for the matter of it probably not being a long incubation period due to my weakened immune system.Thanks again,",

Is that an adequet time period?It has now been over 2 days since the 2 other bumps described above and neither appear to be an obvious blister. One is still slightly red and crater like with no pain and slightly bigger. The other is roughly the same size, not red and no pain.\u00a0\u00a0Anything to be concerned about?Thanks again.",

            "answer": "I have felt much better over the past few days after your responses, thank you.It has now been about 13 days since possible exposure and today I noticed some sensitive skin on the bottom portion of the shaft.The area is only slightly red and slightly burns but with no obvious bump. It's possible that this is due to chaffing from playing basketball last night but this pain didn't really occur until this afternoon. I did have some slight irritation below the tip last night after but it seems to have subsided. Is it possibly to notice chaffing a half a day later?I also had a headache today but don't think it is a fever.Is it typical for a redness, irritation area to occur without a bump? Would a bump come later?How long is it typical to have initial symptoms? I have read 3-20 days but have also seen 14?If it is chaffing, how long would it usually take to subside?Thanks again, I was feeling so much better but this episode has me worried again and I think the anxiety/ constant checking only makes things worse.",

            "answer": "I have a question about NGU since it wasn't covered in your original reply or subsequent ones. I do read you original reply regularly and it brings me comfort.It's now been 25 days and I have come to accept that HSV is highly unlikely given my lack of symtoms but now wonder about NGU.I tested negative for the other bacterial STD's about 82 hours after possible exposure but wasn't sure if they test specifically for NGU or if it would show up that early.I'm not experiencing any burning during urination or abnormal discharge (that I know of).I do feel a slight pain at random times (usually a little while after urination) that seems to be\u00a0\u00a0from the urinary tract more towards the tip. Plus, the tip of my penis is still red (small bump) and a little sensitive. The entire tip also seems a little dry as well (but I may be overreacting there).Is NGU a possiblity here with these symptoms?",

    "question": "A little over 8 days ago I made the worst decision of my life while drunk and received unprotected oral sex from a female sex worker. It didn't last long but did go to completion.I didn't see any signs of a cold sore or anything like on her that but I have been freaked out and scoured the internet but it hasn\u2019t helped.The incident occurred late Friday night. I got a full std test on the next Tuesday afternoon that came back completely clean. I know herpes result wouldn't be accurate so soonI haven't been able to sleep thru the night or eat much since. I have a girl friend of many years and the guilt is killing me. I think I have had some of all the symptoms but it may be stress/anxiety as well.I have a small bump on the very tip of my penis but have been to the dermatologist twice and he has assured me that isn't anything to worry about. It still doesn't hurt and hasn't developed into a blister. I also have no pain when urinating and the bump does get wet.I have noticed two other tiny bumps on the shaft (yesterday) but they don't hurt and aren't close together but I'm still freaked out.I also developed a rash on my scrotum that the dermatologist said the bumps were at the base of the hair follicles so it doesn't seem to be a big deal. I received some general antibiotic cream samples for the rash and to put on the initial bump.Once or twice daily, I feel hot (but no actual fever). This usually last for about 20 mins then goes away.Over the past couple of days I have felt my thighs and calves have ached a little, this also usually passes but has been a little more frequent.I also have had some tingling in my scrotum but not really any on the shaft but it quickly comes and goesBasically, in your opinion how worried should I be based on these symptoms?Is the tingling usually where the infection would be?Is there anything else that could cause the muscle aches in my calf/thighs?How long should it take a bump to become a blister?",
