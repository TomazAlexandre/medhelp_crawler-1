            "answer": "It really sounds like you are having a difficult time. There is obviously something happening to cause these problems, but it is difficult to know what that is without an exam and more information. Although allergy has been ruled out by one doctor, it may be worth talking with an allergist and getting a second opinion. Swollen eyes, weight gain and hands that feel numb and like there are pins and needles could be due to fluid accumulation, and that has many causes from high blood pressure to kidney disease to metabolism problems and hormonal problems such as Cushing's syndrome. While mild hot flashes can be due to menopause, these other problems are likely not normally due to menopause. Given the situation, I can only suggest you seek another opinion and see an allergist or a very good internist. They should be able to come up with an answer. You should worry about this enough to find the answer.Machelle M. Seibel, MD",

    "question": "I am writing this in desperation. Over the past two to three months I have suffered the following symptoms;Very swolen eyes in the morning (allergy has been ruled out by doctor)Extremely painful wrist and hands together with pins and needles and numbness. Worse at night during sleeping hours.I have put on 10 kilograms although my diet has not changed. I have always stuck to a healthy balanced diet.I am post menopause and suffer mild occasional hot flushes.I have had blood tests done for thyroid, kidneys, diabetes and rhumatism. They were all normal.I feel totally exasperated because I am sure my husband thinks I am exagerating because all the tests came back normal and the doctor says I should not worry about the swolen eyes. I am on medication for high blood pressure.Please could someone tell me who I can turn to for help. Are these symptoms normal in post menopause women and should I just accept and suffer in silence,",
