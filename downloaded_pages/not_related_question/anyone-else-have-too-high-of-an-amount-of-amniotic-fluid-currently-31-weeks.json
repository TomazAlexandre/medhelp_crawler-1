But they said it could mean gestational diabetes so I got tested and it wasn't that. He was small 6lb 3 oz when he was born but I'm only 5ft. I was induced early as the cord blood was starting to slow. Hope this helps",

I developed bell palsy with her and had contractions every 2 mins for that month. This time I am having a boy. Just worried because they said it could be a swallowing issue and I am having further Sonos done to see. He's passed for kidneys, heart, and I passed for not having gestational diabetes so we're not sure the cause. After googling it all just freaked me out. Although I am 31 weeks I am measuring at 37 weeks",
