            "answer": "Most people can't tolerate CPAP due to poor preparation and counseling. Try it again with gradual desensitization. A good DME company should work with you to achieve success. A dental device that pulls your jaw forward is another option, but it depends on your anatomy and your sleep numbers. Surgery is always an option, but you have to be evaluated by a qualified ENT surgeon. Talk to your sleep doctor about all these options.Breathing exercises with yoga do help, and I always encourage it, but by itself, it won't cure your problem. Treating the sleep apnea alone won't cure your problems either. You have to approach this holistically, by addressing your entire lifestyle, diet, exercise regimen, mindset, and stress reduction.",
