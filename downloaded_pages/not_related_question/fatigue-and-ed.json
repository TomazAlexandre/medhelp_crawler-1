            "answer": "Hello~some of this can be due to anxiety, also, you may have some pinched nerves, I would see a chiropractor, he/she will take some x-rays and will be able to determine what areas are affected. I would also change physicians since the one you are seeing does not take your symptoms seriously.",

    "question": "Please help if you can,About 3 years ago I had a few fainting episodes. Had a scan, tilt test, everything was fine. Doctors said they can't explain it.Fast forward 3 years I noticed I stopped getting morning erections. Within 2 months found it hard to get erections at all ( even alone) . My parenter broke up with me. No morning erections at all now and really struggle with erections. They are no full and as soon as I finish it goes down within seconds. Doctors don't take me seriously at all cause of my age. Gave me viagra over the phone (didn't even see me face to face) and told me it's mental. Saw urologist for 2 seconds and he said the same thing. No tests done.I've been generally really sleepy lately and keep getting random muscle pains. Numb hands and feet. My penis seems darker shade.I'm worried it could be heart related and the doctors aren't taking me seriously. I was tested for diabetes but they said it's not that ( despite my dad being 1 of 7 kids and all have. Both his parents died young of it).I'm 25. From U.K. Healthy. Excercise.\u00a0\u00a0Not over weight. don't smoke or drink. I eat so healthy too. Couldn't eat much better. As you could imagine it was embarrassing even mentioning to the doctors in the first place. Now it's been a year with no tests apart from one blood test for diabetes. Should I just carry on being extremely tired and taking viagra every time I want to have sexs? Seems a bit bad to me. Don't feel like I've been taking seriously at all. Last time I called she said I might be depressed and again without seeing said I should take anti depressants with the viagra over the phone. That's what happened in 1 year",
