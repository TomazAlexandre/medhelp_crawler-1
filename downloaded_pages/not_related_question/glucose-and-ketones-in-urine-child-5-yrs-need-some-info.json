            "answer": "Hi,if your son had glucose and ketones in his urine, then there is a very real possibility that he has type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0This is different from what your Aunt had, which is Type 2.\u00a0\u00a0Type 1 needs to be managed with injected insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Type 1 can develop after an illness, where the illness triggers the autoimmune attack that results in diabetes.It is possible for your son to have a normal and healthy life.\u00a0\u00a0But this will take a lot of knowledge from you, which you will gain over time.On u-tube there is a series of lectures by Dr. Richard Bernstein on Blood sugar control and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Bernstein Diabetes University.\u00a0\u00a0There is also a an-online support group called Type 1 Grit.\u00a0\u00a0 This group of people use modern treatment combined with low carb diet to get normal blood sugars.Please do not restrict your son's fluid intake at this time.\u00a0\u00a0Do take him straight back to the ER if you have any concerns any changes in his behavior, and in particularly if he has any vomiting or diarrhoea.\u00a0\u00a0Children with Type 1 can rapidly develop diabetic ketoacidosis if they are not treated.Let us know what happens with his results.",

            "answer": "Many thanks for you comment. We were back at the hospital the next day for more tests. They are still saying that they can't be 100% certain as his blood sugars are all normal at the moment but they have said we could of caught it really early so he may still have insulin in his system. We have been sent home with a blood sugar monitor and we need to take four readings a day for the coming weeks. So far yesterday his readings were fine, up until tea time today he was fine also then at the last reading it was 6.9 before tea. So going by the readings they gave us as a guideline this is just in the normal range, but only just. Have to email the diabetes team tomorrow morning with all the readings so far to get the next plan. They are keeping a very close eye on him which is great but the not knowing one way or the other 100% is awful!",

            "answer": "Hi,Stressful when your child has possible problems.When are you testing?\u00a0\u00a0Only before eating?\u00a0\u00a0 Would recommend you test his fasting levels (ideally for a child these are in the 70 - 90 range, preferably lower end).\u00a0\u00a0Also test about 1.5 - 2 hours after he has eaten.\u00a0\u00a0If his levels are normal then he would be < 120 peak, and possibly even below 100.If you have caught this early it is great news... because you can manage it well.\u00a0\u00a0Lower carb is healthy for a child.\u00a0\u00a0Look up the facebook group type1grit.\u00a0\u00a0They have excellent info about maintaining normal blood sugars in children (this is what is important for their normal growth and development).",

            "answer": "My thanks for you comment. Since yesterday the situation is that he has been diagnosed as type 1 diabetes but caught very early so he is still producing some insulin which is either not enough or it isn't not working correctly.So to get us to this point his blood sugar last night before bed rose to 13.8. Phoned A&E who advices me on what we should do. This morning his readings we fully reviewed and we were asked to go the hospital. Once called v",

            "answer": "I apologise for pressing the wrong button and posting half a post. He has been diagnosed with type 1. We were asked to report reading before meals and before bedtime up until this morning but since being in he has had the two hours after meals as well. So this morning he was back down to 4.1 by 11am he was 6.8. Two hours after lunch he was 13.1 but to confuse matters more just before tea he went down to 2.1 without any reason. It was decided to still go ahead with the plan of starting him off on a very small dose of insulin at teatime which they still did do, but this scared the life out of me. So one hour checks until 1am then two hourly for the rest of the night. So one hour after tea they were 16.3, then 15.1 the last report I got was he was done to 14.1 and that he had slept through the last two readings!",

    "question": "HiOver the past week but especially the last two days myself & my husband have been concerned over our sons drinking, as nothing seems to satisfy him. He is also getting up many times a night & having accidents if we don't restrict the amount he has. He shows no other symptoms although he may of lost a little weight but this could also be due to starting school & running around like 5 year olds do. Today (8/12) we took him to the nurse who did a urine test, it came back with glucose & ketones in. We were told to go straight to A & E, which we did. Once there he had finger blood sugars done which were around 4.1, don't know if it matters but he hadn't had tea by this time so hadn't eaten since lunch, around 5 hours ago. All ob's were fine & he had a blood test. As it was getting late & the results\u00a0\u00a0would not be back for a few hours we were told to go home. We have to go back in the morning without him having breakfast for more tests & an appointment with a consultant.A bit of recent health matters is that about 2 months ago he had hand foot & mouth & he has mild asthma.At the moment they are saying that diabetes is just a possibility, obviously nothing can be said for certain until test results come back. We just wondered if anyone had any information they felt able to share with us, anything at all as we are worried sick. My husbands mother has diabetes, she was told it was mainly due to lifestyle & we know that we will deal with this but it is very daunting at this early stage. We know a little about diabetes but only bits & pieces. Myself I'm very much a person in which knowledge helps. We have been looking on the internet but sometimes it's not the best place to look as it will tell you the worst as well as the minimal, personal experiences would be of greater benefit.May we thank anyone in advance for any comments that they may share. We are very grateful that you feel able to share them with us, thank you again.",
