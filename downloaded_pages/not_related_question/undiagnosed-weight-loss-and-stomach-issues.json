            "answer": "There has been a comprehensive evaluation, and I agree with the testing that has been done.\u00a0\u00a0Many of the major GI diseases would have been excluded already, including the various forms of dyspepsia, inflammatory bowel disease, or cancer.I would consider more specialized test, including a blood test to evaluate for celiac disease and breath tests to exclude bacterial overgrowth.If the test remain negative, irritable bowel disease can be considered and treated appropriately with tricyclic antidepressants or the antibiotic Rifaximin.These options can be discussed with your personal physician.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

            "answer": "Hi Robert, our symptoms sound very familiar.\u00a0\u00a0I have had all of the tests that you spoken of plus a few more.\u00a0\u00a0One of the main tests that helped w/ my diagnoses was a gastric stomach emptying study.\u00a0\u00a0Easy easy test, you eat something with something in it that the xray machine can read, lay under this machine for a couple of hours and it can then tell them how fast your food is digesting and how fast or slow that your stomach is emptying.\u00a0\u00a0I have just gone totally blank on everything that I know about this tes!.\u00a0\u00a0I am\u00a0\u00a0having a blonde moment......lol....., no really!!!!!!I was diagnosed w/ Idiopathic Gastroparesis proven by the stomach emptying test.\u00a0\u00a0My stomach just doesn't do the job anymore and it takes many hours, up to 18, to digest anything.\u00a0\u00a0This disease is very common in people w/ diabetes, which I don't have.\u00a0\u00a0I am also ony 43, 39 when this mess started.You might want to talk to your dr. about this test.\u00a0\u00a0My Gastroenterologist was the one who performed this.\u00a0\u00a0Not sure what kind of dr. you re going to.\u00a0\u00a0 Just my opinion/suggestion which is the reason that I am always on this site looking for more information myself.\u00a0\u00a0 Take care and you are in my thoughts.Kimberly, Oklahoma",

    "question": "Hi,My health situation is that I have been unintentionally losing weight and having stomach discomfort (gassy stomach and bloating), loose stool and diarrhea for over a year. I have discussed with my doctors about bacteria infections and a malabsorption syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0They have ordered a colonoscopy, endoscopy with biopsy, parasite test, and blood work, but all test results have come back looking normal.I was wondering what your opinion is for repeating these tests, and if you have any suggestions for further testing. Thank you,Evan",
