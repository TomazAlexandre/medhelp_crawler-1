    "question": "I have been in the pre diabetic range for over 10 years with my A1c hovering between 5.8 and 6.2. Have never been on any medication related to pre diabetes.For the last two weeks I have fnoticed by BG readings have changed noticeably.To give you an example I eat the same breakfast every day for years and one hour later my meter has normally read about 120. Now my meter is reading85\u00a0\u00a0before bkfast 88 an hour after and 72 two hours after.My pre dinner and after dinner measurement have shown similar significantly lower readings. As an experiment last night I had an intentionally starchy pasta meal with bread and ice cream for dessert My pre dinner number was 75. An hr later my bg was 129 (normally it would be 160+ after such a meal)Three hours later it was 92.Am planning a doctors appt to discuss this but am interested in any info on what may be causing this lowering of my BG levels.Thanks for any insight as to what may be causing this",
