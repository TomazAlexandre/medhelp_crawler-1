            "answer": "Hello,Good question.\u00a0\u00a0It is not uncommon for pregnancy dating by ultrasound (U/S) to differ from dating determined by the last menstrual period (LMP).\u00a0\u00a0The earlier the u/s the more accurate it is in determining the age of the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0U/S is often used to confirm a woman's dating and if there is a discrepancy, the u/s dating is used.\u00a0\u00a0General guidelines are that if a 1st trimester u/s differs 7 days or more, or a 2nd trimester u/s differs 14 days or more from the due date based on the LMP, the u/s dating is used.\u00a0\u00a0If the due date is within the 7 or 14 day window the LMP is usedAlso, if a woman is not certain about her LMP it is usually best to use u/s dating.\u00a0\u00a0Given your LMP is uncertain, you should base your dating on the 7 week ultrasound.Best regards,Dr. Downing",

            "answer": "The ultrasound has become so helpful now refer to the time before it was used routinely as \"the olden days.\" We use it to diagnose twins early on; we use it to document appropriate growth as the pregnancy progresses; we use it to determine fetal health; Of all of these uses, dating the pregnancy is the most common reason to use ultrasound, particularly when the expectant mother cannot remember the date of her last period (as in breast-feeding or irregular cycles). Even when the last period is known, ultrasound is reassuring to demonstrate adequate growth, especially when there's a risk of delayed growth, as in hypertension or smoking, or if there's the risk of exaggerated growth, as in gestational diabetes. It is not uncommon for babies that are labeled \"Large for Gestational Age (LGA)\" and \"IntraUterine Growth Restriction (IUGR)\" to have monthly or even weekly ultrasounds during the pregnancy.",
