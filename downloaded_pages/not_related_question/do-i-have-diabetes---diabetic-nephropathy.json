            "answer": "Hi,Your glucose numbers suggest you have some impaired glucose tolerance and that is considered pre-diabetes. Some of your symptoms, for example the frequent urination and orthostatic hypotension, are not commonly associated with pre-diabetes so they should be further evaluated as well. Given some of your symptoms, I think you should have a full endocrine evaluation for pituitary function as well as adrenal function, and possible malabsorptive diseases(like Celiac disease). I strongly suggest you have a consultation with an Endocrinologist to have this evaluation done.There is not currently fully accepted supplement thought to reduce diabetes complications. Cinnamon supplementation has shown some promise but is still being further investigated, and there are various herbs that have some effect but are not proven in large studies.I cannot comment on the gallbladder issue, this is best discussed with a gastroenterologist.You can drink juice even if you are a diabetic but they should be dilute and true fruit juice without added sugar. Ideally, stay with water, it is best.Frequent urination itself is not thought to cause renal damage unless the CAUSE of the urination has caused kidney damage for example a bad kidney infection.Life expectancy for people with diabetes(true diabetes, not prediabetes) is reduced mainly because of possible complications . But these can largely be prevented with good care. I do not know if all of your concerning symptoms stem from your pre-diabetic stage.Take care and certainly seek out the opinion and guidance of a specialist. If you do not have one in your area and live in CA,FL or SC, you can visit our practice website at www.endocrinehelp.com for a consultation.",
