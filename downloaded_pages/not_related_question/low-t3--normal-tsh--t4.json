Which is why I went back to doctor, as I did not want to gain back any of it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Its holding steady now that I am on the medication, but I am concerned about the shakeiness I feel, and not being able to speak right.\u00a0\u00a0 As that is my job.\u00a0\u00a0 I am on the phone all day long.\u00a0\u00a0It appears the treatment caused me to have hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0 Which could have been my problem before this treatment, as I also did treatment in 93, and ballooned after that, and developed diabetes.. etc etc, but that has all cleared as well, now that I lost the weight.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Its just the thyroid issue.\u00a0\u00a0 Do I have to take that for the rest of my life ?",
