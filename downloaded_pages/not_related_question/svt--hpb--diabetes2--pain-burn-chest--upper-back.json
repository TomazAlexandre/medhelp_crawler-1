            "answer": "HiI am a male 40 years old, 6'0 275lbs being treated for high blood pressure and high cholesterol. I do not smoke and I exercises moderately 4 times a week. Besides the exercise, I have a desk job 5 days a week getting little other exercise. Someone suggested that I consider a inner imaging screening (EBT Hart scan). I am on Lipitor and Vytorin. Recent blood work revealed cholesterol at 118 but CPK at 205 also I have been experiencing lower back pain. Do you think I should consider this image screening?",
