            "answer": "Hello~From the description of your symptoms, I would highly recommend seeing a chiropractor; your neck and upper back could have misplaced vertebrae, this in turn will certainly cause the dizzy/lightheaded feeling you are having.You mentioned that you had blood tests done, including one for diabetes, did they draw one for an A1c? this will show what your sugar levels have been doing for the last three months. I say this because some of your symptoms do sound blood-sugar related.Also, how about food allergies, they, too, can cause these symptoms.I would ask for a food allergy panel, a chemical allergy panel, and A1C, and then also see a chiropractor. If you can not get a doctor to do the tests, then seeing a Naturopath would be a very wise decision as your next course of action.",

            "answer": "I have hypothyroidism myself (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) and my symptoms always rule over a lab test. Something I know very well from experience!\u00a0\u00a0There are many many comments online of hypothyroid symptoms with \"normal\" lab ranges. As a general guide however, the Free T3 and Free T4 should be above the median (middle) but below the upper end of the laboratory normal reference range.Excerpt from Nature Endocrine Solution article - \"Is There A Connection Between Hypoglycemia and Thyroid Conditions?\"...\"Another potential reason why hypoglycemia is more common in people with hypothyroidism and Hashimoto\u2019s Thyroiditis is because thyroid hormone impacts the liver, and a compromised liver can lead to the development of hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0Excess glucose is stored in the liver, and so if the liver isn\u2019t functioning properly then the storage of glucose might be affected.\"",

    "question": "For around 8 months I have experienced extreme fatigue along with bouts of vertigo like dizzyness, I have been on thyroxine for hypothyroid for over a year and I have had a blood test which shows everyone normal and nothing abnormal and my thyroid stable, however I have been to do the doctor due to the vertigo which feels like I'm on a boat, headaches and recurring bouts off feeling like I'm going to pass out even after eating. I am 22 year old male and only weigh 9.9. I have had blood tests done including diabetes but everything has come back normal I also check my blood sugar which seems to be fine however I'm constantly feeling even after eating shaky weak and hot like I'm going to pass out. My doctor says that the vertigo could be associated with sinus infection or/migraine as I do experience regular headache and have had aura with migraine. I am completely stumped why I am experiencing these symptoms when I'm very healthy, don't smoke, drink alcohol or sugary drinks and eat slow realease foods, I act like a diabetic would regarding diet. If anyone has any clue as to why I'm experiencing these symptom please message. Also the dizzyness is very strange at times such as this morning after normal bfast of oats and fruit I felt exhausted no energy and I feel like I'm having some sort of migraine along with vertigo, swaying etc also maybe i need to see a neaurologist?",
