            "answer": "I think secondary just means it was caused by another medical problem which is obviously the Mitral Valve Regurgitation, for both of us. Like you, I do not understand how this will impact my lifespan, as my research into PH does not make one optimistic. I wish you the best of luck with your journey. I suggest you check out the PH Association's web sight because they will send you a free and wonderful book on PH. I have just begun to read it myself and hope to have some answers soon.",

    "question": "I have had an echo done where I was told that I have mild to moderate mitral valve regurgitation. The pressure was 47mmhg. I saw a pulmonologist\u00a0\u00a0who said he believes I have secondary pulmonary hypertension. Waiting to here from my cardiologist. Kinda freaking out. Should I be worried?",
