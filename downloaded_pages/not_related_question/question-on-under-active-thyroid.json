            "answer": "A slightly low TSH means minimally overactive thyroid - but this may be part of a larger thyroid problem and the current test misleading or your symptoms may have nothing to do with thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Since you are close by, we would be happy to see you for consultation.\u00a0\u00a0But would at least do a full thyroid panel including antibodies and test for other causes of weight gain such as cushings (tumor over producing cortisol) and insulin resistance (pre-diabetes).\u00a0\u00a0In the insulin resistance case (a very common, often overlooked cause of weight gain, etc) - we make the diagnosis then refer back to the primary or GYN as well as nutrition/exercise specialist for treatment.",

            "answer": "I had the same symptoms for many months before I found out my thyroid had tumors on it. I am not saying you have the same things as me, but I suspect your thyroid might be the problem. I would search for a doc who would not dismiss your complaint as trivial, or having to do with old age, menopause and a psychiatric problem. These seem to be the favorite excuses alot of the MD's I visited, used to ignore my condition. Just keep trying and don't take no for an answer.Good luck!",

    "question": "Dear Dr. LupoI am hoping you can help me. I am a 37 year old female and I live in Bradenton, Florida. For the last 18 months I have become progressively more and more fatigued to the point where I am always exhausted. I have gained 20 pounds during this time period. I eat a very healthy diet and I exercise regularly. I can't lose a single pound, if I cut down on calories. My skin has become really dry and my hair coarse. I have terrible PMS and recently had an edometrial ablation becasue my periods were so heavy. I am also having trouble remembering things. All in\u00a0\u00a0all I am miserable. My OB/GYN ordered a TSH test which came back slightly low and referred me to my family physician.\u00a0\u00a0Well my family physician blew me off and said it was nothing. He did not ask if I had any symptoms, I kind of had to take the bull by the horns and say 'Look I am miserable, this is how I feel, can you help\". I know that my labs don't make sense, but I really feel like my metabolism has shut down.\u00a0\u00a0Reluctantly he ordered some more blood work and a thyroid ultrasound.My family doctor made me feel like a complete hypochondriac. I am so frustrated I just want to feel well. Do have any suggestions or advice?Thanks so muchKelly",
