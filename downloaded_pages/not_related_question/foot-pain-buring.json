            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Numbness on the side of your foot would be unusual to be a side effect of oxcarbazepine. How long have you had trigeminal neuralgia? Have you ever had an MRI of your brain? Another cause of facial pain include giant cell arteritis or temporal arteritis. This condition is due to an inflammation in the temporal artery and other arteries in the body. Symptoms include one sided headache pain in the temple and jaw that may be triggered by chewing. This condition can be diagnosed by a blood test called an ESR and a biopsy of the artery. It is very important to rule this diagnosis out since it is highly treatable and if left untreated it can lead to vision loss. It is exceedingly rare in people younger than 55, and is more common in even older age groups.Regarding your foot, it is possible that you may have a local nerve injury, neuroma, or perhaps a neuropathy (the most common etiology being diabetes).I would suggest you follow up with your neurologist to discuss before making any adjustments to your medication.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
