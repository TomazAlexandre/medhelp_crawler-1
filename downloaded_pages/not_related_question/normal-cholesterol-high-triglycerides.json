            "answer": "Dear Brockwiser,I am very glad to hear you have lost 15 pounds and run 2 miles per day. Unfortunately, your triglycerides are elevated, <150mg/dL is considered normal. Certain conditions are associated with\u00a0\u00a0elevated triglyceride levels\u00a0\u00a0including obesity, diabetes, hypothyroidism and alcohol abuse.\u00a0\u00a0Also, certain medications and concentrated sugars may raise triglyceride levels. Beta blockers, diretics and glucocorticoids may have an adverse effect on triglyceride levels. Excerise and dietary modification is a great initial first step. If lifestyle modification is not sufficient to lower your triglycerides, it may be a good idea to add a fibrate to your current medical regimen.Thanks for your question,CCF-MD-KE",

            "answer": "The physician mentioned your cutting down on sugars. I recommend this highly. My triglycerides were a whopping 396, so I went on a low-carb diet (I chose Atkins, but there are several out there). In only two months, my triglycerides dropped to 81! My cholesesterol profile improved as well. Cutting out simple sugars, sodas, pastas, potatoes, white breads, pastas, etc., seems to really work. Much of this evidence has recently been backed up by studies at Duke and Harvard.",

            "answer": "My Triglycerides Post Quad Bipass were in the mid 600s. I heard about Atkins and decided to try it. After 9 days my Cholesterol went from 240 to 178. My triglycerides went down to 190. two months later my triglycerides were under 170, fantastic for me! I think Atkins, if you can stick to it is a fantastic lifestyle change that will lower cholesterol, triglycerides and stabilize blood sugar. Buy the book, read it and monitor your bloodwork. Don't let the quacks deter you from trying to take your life back!!Mike",

    "question": "I am a 32 year old male. I got my lipid panel done. I have questions on the results:Total Cholesterol: 166HDL: 45LDL: 63Tri: 290What would cause Total Cholesterol to be normal, but have such a high level of triglycerides? I have lost 15 pounds and run two miles a day. What can I do other than medication? Was diagnosed with HBP, but that seems to be under control.They are doubling my Lipitor dosage to 40 mg.",
