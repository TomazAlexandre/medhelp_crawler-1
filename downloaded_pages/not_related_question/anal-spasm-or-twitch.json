            "answer": "I had a similar problem. Grumpy56 s suggestion: tightening the sphincter muscles a few seconds for a few times a day helps. I find that problem is caused in my case by sitting too long on the toilet. I dislike public toilets and spend enough time in loo at home in the mornings till I feel my bowels are empty. But the age (I mean getting older) and type of food consumed effect bowel function. Apparently the healthy style of pooping is 'dump and go'. Less time in loo and tightening exercise couple of times helped me to overcome the condition.",
