            "answer": "I was diagnosed at 7 and I'm 16 now and have always never wanted to go to any camps because I thought that probably only small kids or weirdos go to them but I have always wondered about camps and if they actually help, I have really been struggling with my diabetes for the past couple years and I was wondering if anyone knows of any good camps that would be suitable for a 16 year old girl? It can be either gender mixed or exclusively female i honestly don't care as long as it's not crazy expensive.",

            "answer": "Cato1023 - Like I said the first time I went to a diabetic camp I was 16. It was the best decision I've ever made. Most of the programs are a week long. But I know depending on where you go, there are three day programs. So if you end up not liking it, it's not like you've wasted your whole summer.The only one I've been to is Camp Needlepoint in Hudson Wisconsin. I absolutely love it! 10/10 recommend!I know there is also one in North Dakota, I think it's called Camp Souix. I'm thinking of applying to work there next summer.Otherwise, you can go to the American Diabetes Association website and they have a whole list of every diabetic camp in the US. So there might be one close to where ever you live!And unfortunately they are kinda expensive because you're also paying for the insulin they provide and other medical stuff. When I was a camper the program I did was roughly $500. But the local Lions Club paid for me to go.",

            "answer": "Camp Seale Harris in Alabama (if you are located down south) is a great option. I'm 27, was diagnosed when I was 7 and my mom coaxed me into going. Thought it would be weird because the last thing I wanted was to be different, stand out, or have my medical issues in display.\u00a0\u00a0Instead, it was a great learning experience where I made some awesome friends who were also diabetic and could relate to my issues. Highly recommend you going there or somewhere else if given the opportunity. Will be very helpful for you at any age (camper or counselor).Their website is http://www.campsealeharris.org if you wanna look them up",

    "question": "I was just wondering if any of you guys have ever been a camper or a camp Counselor at a camp for diabetics? I was a camper at camp needlepoint in Wisconsin when I was 16. I'm 23 now and I've been a camp Counselor twice. I might be working a there again this summer, still waiting to hear back. I highly recommend diabetes camp for kids and teenagers. It truly helped me understand and take better control of my diabetes. And I still have friends that I talk to that I met that first year I was there.",
