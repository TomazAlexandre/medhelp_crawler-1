            "answer": "ScottFirst let me say thanks your your service. Without knowing any of the specifics of your age and risk factors for PAD including cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension and smoking it is hard to make the diagnosis in this format. I can however share with you some facts and you can tell me if they apply.When I evaluate a patient for PAD, my first questions inquire about your walking distance. Early, mild PAD is frequently associated with symptoms of claudication which is cramps in the calves or thighs with exertion usually around 2,3 or 4 blocks. The symptoms are usually worse with brisk walking. The cramping should resolve promptly with rest. The fact that your feet bother you all of the time is inconsistent with early PAD and is more frequently associated with neuropathy or dammage to the nerves of the feet.The best test to assess the presence of PAD initially is called and ABI or ankle brachial index which is a measure of blood pressure at the ankle compared to blood pressure at the elbow. the normal value in a non affected person is greater than .9. This test should easily determine if you have PAD, how severe it is and if you need further testing or treatment.The best management of mild PAD is to control your risk factors mentioned above with medications and to quit smoking if you smoke. Also an exercise program is helpful. I generally dont use pletal because its quite expensive and in the best case scenario, studies show that it only improves walking distance by 20% ie 2 blocks to 2.5 blocks. Not very much for over $2.00 day in costGet to a vascular specialist and put any questions to rest about the severity of your problem. Also realize that the presence of blockages in your legs increases the likelihood that you have them in your heart.Best of health",

            "answer": "I suspect that you are on coumadin for your dvt because it was felt to be acute. acute dvt has a risk of embolizing (breaking off) and floating to your heart. . That risk diminishes after the dvt becomes chronic, usually 3 months or so. I agree that you need to see a vascular specialist to assess your legs for chronic venous insufficiency and PAD. Coumadin is not a treatment for PAD. PAD forms because of cholesterol from you diet, diabetes and smoking. Coumadin will do nothing to prevent these things",
