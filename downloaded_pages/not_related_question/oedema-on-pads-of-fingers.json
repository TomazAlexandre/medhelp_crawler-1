            "answer": "HI,I am somewhat limited because I cannot examine your fingers to see what this looks like. In general, edema on the hands/fingers can be from medication side effects, general heart failure symptoms, and also thyroid problems, just to name a few sources.After your doctor checks out those possibilties, try a dermatologist to see if they have any suggestions as well.Best of luck to you.",

    "question": "I have developed diabetes type 2 one year ago (aged 54) Hb1ac <6 on metformin 500mg/day, losartan 50mg, & simvastatin 20 mg/day. Have oedema on pads of fingers (developed over last 6 months) which is worse on thumbs which causes the skin to be fragile. Have tried steroid ointment but does not seem to help so just use E45 ointment which keeps the skin from becomming too dry. GP seems to think it is ematitis but have not been able to find specifc agent causing problesm - any ideas?",
