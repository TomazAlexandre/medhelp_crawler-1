    "question": "Healthy 150 lb age 61, shaken when I had 1st recorded AFib Nov \u201907 (after\u00a0\u00a0dental surgery) causing me to go on 25 mg. Atenolol (taken late evening) & aspirin ( already on Lisinopril\u00a0\u00a0keeping BP under 140/80). Appears Atenolol not good . All Dec light headed & had occasional Afib. Jan fainted one morning after awakin w/ low BP 90/58 after a\u00a0\u00a0night of AFib episode ( I was urinating\u00a0\u00a0frequently). Hindsight: totally stressed out.\u00a0\u00a0After the fainting, cardio ruled out plumbing/ valve.While off atenolol at hospital (stress test had to be done while not on\u00a0\u00a0blocker), I threw 2 pretty good 10 min AFib episodes heart pounded. Again I was sleep deprived & anxious.Jan 16\u00a0\u00a0two lead pacemaker implanted (set to spark\u00a0\u00a0below 50 &\u00a0\u00a0record\u00a0\u00a0beat over 170). In addition to adding Coumidin, they were\u00a0\u00a0going to put me back on 25 mg of Atenolol & increase its dosage or switch me to stronger drugs as needed. And w/ pacemaker they have a record of my heart.. I asked that they try lopressor (Metoprolol) instead ( Bp drug on\u00a0\u00a0before\u00a0\u00a0I was switched off to Lisinopril).Since going\u00a0\u00a0to Metoprolol & taking in AM & sleeping 8 hours & trying to avoid stress, very little afib (my 45 day pacemaker recording (reviewed for the first time yesterday) shows one 2 minute mild Afib episode. The pacemaker has not had to spark or record high reading.. I not waking all night urinating. I am not waking up AM with low bp. I still from time get a weird feeling in my head (like interference) and worry Memory is not as fast at retrieving\u2026..maybe my magination. Very gratefull so far AFib seems to be in check\u2026.fingers crossed.My /optimistic ? If someone has a 6 - 12 month\u00a0\u00a0run of only 5-10 short mild Afib episodes, is getting off coumidin a possibility.Aside from bleeding I assume\u00a0\u00a0drug has side effects???aside from issue of\u00a0\u00a0metal in your chest, once implanted successfully does pacem presence effect morbidity for an otherwise healthy person?",
