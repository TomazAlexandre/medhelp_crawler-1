            "answer": "Emphysema does not cause night sweats.\u00a0\u00a0Recurrent night sweats would actually suggest that you have another health problem, unrelated to emphysema, but possibly an infectious pulmonary disease, such as tuberculosis (TB).\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes can also cause night sweats as can a number of other diseases.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, it is not uncommon for a person to have night sweats, for no apparent cause, but that should not be your assumption.I suggest that you see your doctor, for evaluation of the night sweats.Good luck.",

            "answer": "So many things can cause night sweats...If you are experiencing any symptoms that are a concern to you check with your doctor...Fibromyalgia, lupus, certain cancers, menopause...the list is long....if this is the only symptom you still may want to check with your Doctor...It never hurts to get their opinion and even though this site is awesome to talk with other people, its not a diagnosis so it may calm you as well just to talk to your Doctor...You may want to check your blood pressure as well..if its too high this could be a possibility...Good Luck!!",
