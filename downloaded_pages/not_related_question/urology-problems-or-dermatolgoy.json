            "answer": "During the time I started having these symtoms I had 2 things going on, my medicine for Diabetes was increased and I had a prostate exam. Could I be having and allegic reaction from the medicine(dose was increased from 2.5 to 5 mg of Glipazide) or could I have had some type of irritation from the digital and ulttra sound of my prostate. Prostate was in good shape. Also caould I be having a Herpes outbreak for 5 months straight with just itching. One more question could I just have anxiety that's driving me crazy. Other Doctor suggest testing past 4 months is pretty goood. I know testing aren't 100%.",

            "answer": "I am having similar symptoms as Gerard, but I am female.\u00a0\u00a0I've had mind-boggling rectal/vaginal itching since I was diagnosed with a UTI the end of October.\u00a0\u00a0I've taken amoxicillin & a sulfate antibiotic - received the prescription that changes the color of urine (no relief), nystatin cream, dulfocan pill, etc. etc.\u00a0\u00a0I've gone to three different docs (one was a gyno).\u00a0\u00a0He prognosed it as \"fungus\".\u00a0\u00a0The cream he prescribed, nystatin with triamcinolone, has alieviated alot of the itching, but it is still there.\u00a0\u00a0It is almost like I have \"spells\".\u00a0\u00a0The past 6 months, all of my urine tests show blood in the urine.\u00a0\u00a0My reg doc had me get an ultrasound of kidneys/bladder, which comes out ok.\u00a0\u00a0All blood work comes out ok.\u00a0\u00a0I now feel pain again in my lower left back.\u00a0\u00a0I am at my wit's end trying to figure out what to do.\u00a0\u00a0I am obese and it doesn't help the fact that I am limited to exercise because I don't want to sweat & cause the fungus to reoccur (not just itching-very severe red scalding on inner thighs). The gyno said the fungus occurred because of my weight, & foods that feed it(sugar,breads,etc.). My bloodwork for diabetes & menopause always comes out ok.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm not a hypocondriac, but feel like there is something terribly wrong that these three docs apparently missed.\u00a0\u00a0Any advice?",

            "answer": "I ffeel your frustation. My Doc tells me that its fungus/yeast also but the itching is still there. I am\u00a0\u00a0Diabetic though but because of my symtoms this Doctor suggest that my urine and blood test maybe false. Have you had test for all of the STD's. I have also gone on a website about yeast and fungual infextion and they're people who have had this problem for a year or longer. Now that I have been on this medication for a lil while longer the symtoms see to have less'n. I just hope and pray it's not Herpes cause I seen someblog of people going years without knowing. The other Doctors in the STD forum suggest it's not because Herpes come and go. They say you don't have symptoms for 5 months and not have a breakout.",

    "question": "This all started back in at the end of Aug. It started with a pain in the left testicle. Then is started having a burning sensation when I voided. It went away about a week later then I started having pain at the top of my penis after I urinated. this went on for about a week or two. After that I started having itching(Sept) on my scrotum and on my penis. This has been going on for 4 months now. I have had test done for all STD's, Herpes 1&2 IgG typep specifc, HIV all were negative. The Doctor said it is probably a fungus or yeast. I was given some cream and Duflican. The Itching has subdude but has not gone. It now tend to happen after I void or before I have to. I have been on the Medication for two weeks now.",
