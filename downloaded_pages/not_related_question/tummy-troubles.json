            "answer": "I agree with the workup thus far.The elevated amylase can be consistent with pancreatitis, which is most commonly caused by alcohol use or a gallstone.I agree with the CT scan.\u00a0\u00a0If pancreatic cancer is of concern, an MRI or endoscopic ultrasound should be considered.Another test to consider would be an upper endoscopy - which can evaluate the stomach and upper GI tract.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patients education only.
