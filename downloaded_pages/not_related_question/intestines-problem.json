            "answer": "Hi!Yes, one can feel very apprehensive when no answers are available and nothing seems to be helping with the symptoms. Usually, the symptoms of \u201csevere bloating, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pains\u201d are due to IBS or irritable bowel syndrome. This is diagnosed by exclusion of other irritable bowel diseases such as Crohn\u2019s disease, celiac and ulcerative colitis. IBS also causes slowing of the gut. Other than this, since there is vomiting, you could also be having a bad gastric reflux.Other causes of slowing of gut are diabetes and hypothyroidism. To some extent electrolyte imbalance is also a possibility. Hence, please discuss with your doctor and ask regarding tests (blood tests, endoscopy, colonoscopy etc as required) to rule out these causes. The fatigue and headaches could be due to persisting vomiting and diarrhea.Also, log in what you eat and see if there is a correlation between a certain food type and the symptoms. Drink 7-8 glasses of a combination of the following: water/fresh fruit juice/clear soups. Eat fresh fruits, salads, whole grains, cereals etc for roughage.Chew your food well and eat frequent small meals during the day. Avoid bulk eating, fried and spicy food. Avoid junk food, alcohol and caffeine. Take probiotics.Hopefully all these life style changes will help you. Logging in your food will help detect foods that cause more problems. You could avoid these.I sincerely hope you will find this information useful in your journey towards better health. Please discuss these possibilities with your doctor. Try and adapt the mentioned lifestyle changes.Hope you get well soon! Good Luck and take care!",
