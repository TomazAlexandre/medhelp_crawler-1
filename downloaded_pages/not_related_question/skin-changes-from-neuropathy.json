            "answer": "your symptoms are not characterisitc of primary nerve disease but may be a reflection of teh underlying disorder causing the neuropathy for instance - autoimmune disease like lupus , which can cause Raynauds phenomenom (red/white/blue). Other causes also can cause 'atrophic change in teh skin' like diabetes and peripheral vascular disease - these should be checked for.Small fiber neuropathy is generally very slowly progressive but prognosis for reversal depends on the underlying cause. Good foot care and podiatry is important to prevent ulcers, infections etc of the feet. Menopuase in itself is not a cause of neuropathy.",
