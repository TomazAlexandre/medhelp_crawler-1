            "answer": "I to believe it would be unethical to make a profit on insurance paid supplies, however that is not the case here. I have to pay out of pocket for every diabetic supply I need. You see I am one of those lucky diabetics with NO INSURANCE! So in the future, please get all the facts before you put other people down ie: \"scummy\" ? Give me a break. This world needs kindness, not meanness!",

            "answer": "Where did your attitude come from?\"Scummy\" would be, say, a person who sold their insurance paid supplies for a profit. Or \"scummy\" would be someone claiming to be needy only to turn around and sell those same donated supplies for a profit. Ya see?You're not scummy so don't worry. You just don't read posts that well before responding. This world needs people who can read.",

    "question": "I, too, have some pump supplies I'd rather see go to a needy, fellow diabetic rather than...where ever it is you're supposed to dump them (OR some \"supplies flipper\" trying to make a profit).I'm concerned that since my insurance technically purchased them, are there negative legal implications for giving them away (or sold as some people I see here are doing)? Not to mention they're a prescibed item and legally require an Rx to obtain.'Just curious.For the record I, personally, would only ever expect shipping/handling charges as I feel selling for a profit on insurance payed supplies is unethical, most likely illegal, and scummy. Life if madness enough for diabetics. Let's help each other out, right?",
