            "answer": "HiI am, no expert on menopause so I can only give you my best guess since I have the two conditions your talking about that you have that have recked havoc on your life.I just got a bottle of progesta care from a friend kind of a humerous Birthday gift.\u00a0\u00a0She was here from NY and I can't get it here in California cause they like to force us Californian's to Help support Big Pharma and the incentives they hand out for the RX being written. IF you know what I mean. They have been doing it with Synthroid for years now. The just recently found a way to get rid of the tried and true drugs that have been around for many many years that they call Grandfathered. So that they could force us to spend more money and make us use more profitable brands. So for me my best Thyroid med is now not made anymore and I can't get the cream for Perimenopause here. \\Anyway sorry got on my soap box for a minute there. LOLMy friends who are also Hashi's paitents they are having a lot of success with the cream. I think it depends on how much you use and how many days you take it.But I had heard that once you haven't had a period for 1 year...you are done with it and you are now in menopause. So if your taking the cream to get a period again.\u00a0\u00a0From my count...you are in menopause now.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe I am, not understanding Phantom periods? Maybe that's what I am, having. I just posted myself.Anyway here is a suggestion of a place you can go get tons of help from women who are on it. It's a yahoo board and it's called\u00a0\u00a0http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/healthylivingwithhypothyroidism/ look for\u00a0\u00a0 dnadragonfly\u00a0\u00a0she is great! HTH!",

I'm also having the hot flashes and abdominal bloating & cramping (phantom periods). My last period was 3/1/07. I wouldn't be complaining if it weren't for the discomfort that i'm in. I just wish i knew if the progesterone cream was working.Anyone else?",
