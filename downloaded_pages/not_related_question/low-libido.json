            "answer": "Well, the good news is that you care. That's the first step.There are several approaches to low libido and the order in which you address them depends on what you think might really be going on.The first might be to go to a doctor who specializes in hormones. An Endocrinologist can take a blood sample and find out\u00a0\u00a0 if you have a hormone problem that might be affecting your sexual interest.If nothing physical can be found, it is still possible that a doctor might reccommend some medication that might affect your sexual interest- such as Largenine- an herb that some people feels has an impact- he or she could also check your other medications since some medications like anti-depressants and diabetes medicines can affect libido.If your doctor feels there is no medical cause of low libido, then I would suggest going to see a psychologist who feels that they are competent to handle sexual issues, as well as general ones. The doctor could see if you are depressed - or if there are issues in your background that make sex unpleasant or scary.At the same time you might start a campaign to get in touch with your body. Join a gym, get physical in some way. Sometimes our bodies make us feel bad about ourselves or disconnected from feeling sensual or strong. An overall physical health program can really make a difference!Don't give up-,.almost all people have some sexual drive- you probably do too-- and you are right- you need to find a way to be sexual with your partner. He deserves it-- and you do too!",

            "answer": "hey i've been in the same situation, excluding the fact that i've only been married for 1yr, but me and my husband recently had a baby and my sex drive went down even more than before. one thing that helps me out a lot is that he tries new things, for example experimenting with foods on my body, watching xx-rated movies together, or just lighting some candles and giving eachother a nice warm bath... and oh, oral might help too....",
