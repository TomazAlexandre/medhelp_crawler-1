            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.I cannot comment if the electrical shocks are related to the spondylolisthesis since I am not sure where the sensations are located or where the slipped disc is located. Tingling sensations can have multiple of causes including diabetes, autoimmune, vitamin deficiency, toxins and certain nesoplasms. Additional workup may include EMG/NCS (if indicated) or QSART and possible skin biopsy. Treatment usually includes neurontin or lyrica. If the sensations follow a particular nerve pattern and localizes to where the spondylolisthesis is, the two may be related. An MRI of the spine would be helpful in this diagnosis.The term dizziness has many uses. It can be a sense of imbalance, room-spinning, or lightheadedness. If it is room-spinning, it may be unrelated to the shock-like sensations. It could be condition called benign positional vertigo (BPPV). This is a common condition that worsens with turning of head. It is easily treatable.\u00a0\u00a0Dizziness can also be of a central cause such as a schwanoma (aka acoustic neuroma) which can be diagnosed by MRI. Also, thyroid dysfunction and certain types of migraines can cause dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0If the electrical shocks are on one side of body and unrelated to your back condition, you should be examined for multiple sclerosis or a stroke. This would be done with an MRI. These last two are less likely given the chronicity of your symptoms.If by dizziness you mean lightheadedness, you should have your blood pressure and hemoglobin checked. Hypotension and anemia can cause lightheadedness.Lastly, I should mention that anxiety and depression can cause dizziness and tingling sensations. Once the condition is treated the symptoms usually resolve.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
