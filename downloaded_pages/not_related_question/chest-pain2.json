            "answer": "helloGiven your age and minimal medical history, it is unlikely that it is the type of heart problem associated with poor blood flow, ie heart attack. I would suggest that you see your pcp to be evaluated and to have an ekg. The most likely cause of the discomfort is costochondritis (inflammation of your ribs and cartilage)I would use this small scare as motivation to overhall your exercise and get your thorough physical exam and checkup. visit www.personalwellnesswheel.com for more information on a preventative health strategy.Good luck",

            "answer": "Hi Dr,I'm 28, 5'8\", around 135 pounds (not skinny). I did a blood test about 6 months ago and I had slightly high cholesterol (I dont have the test right now, but the result was about 50 points greater than the upper limit). No diabetes or stroke but do have subclinical hypothyroidism. I work out every 5 days (since year 2000), but still activity level is extremely low, spend most all time at home office (telecommute job), no chores. I had an ekg done about 4 months ago in Mexico and apparently fine (they just asked me to lay down for the test, but not to do any physical activity),regarding family history, mother has high cholesterol , my younger brother has diabetes, grandfather has \"palpitations\", grandmother a handful of issues including cholesterol and diabetes, family has a history of thyroid disorders.not sure what to answer regarding exercise tolerance and stress test..Regarding the chest pain, I assumed it is related to the heart, pain was at the left side of the chest, I would say where the heart is located. Yesterday I did not feel any chest pain, but I have had this pain earlier this month as well, one time I could not even sleep lying down because my chest hurt each time my heart palpitated. On my previous post I mentioned that the pain was literally as if a needle was progressively going through the heart as I inhaled, and pain relieved progressively as I exhaled. I do not have any injuries in my chest. I can provide more detailed descriptions or any other information you need :)do you believe i should talk to a physician for an ekg or some other test?",

    "question": "Hi Dr,Last night a left side chest pain woke me up. The deeper the breath I took the harder my chest hurt. I've been having this problem frequently over the last month. The pain happens only while inhaling, it feels as if a needle is going through the heart, and the needle goes off while exhaling. I remember having this same problem since I was a kid (around 10 yr old) and back then I could not even yawn because of the pain, and sometimes the pain (i.e. needle through the heart each time taking a breath) lasted about two days. I do not recall my left arm being asleepI have never been to a doctor to address this issue. I was wondering what you think of this, if you recommend running some tests.Also, please let me know if you would like me to provide other detailsThanks,",
