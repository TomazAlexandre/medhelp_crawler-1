    "question": "Male - age 42.Let me start by saying that I have been plagued by a fear of disease and dying for years and I know that has caused me to stress about many things over the years that have turned out to be nothing.\u00a0\u00a0But who knows, there might be something really wrong with me some day and I will need to get it taken care of.\u00a0\u00a0My latest battle has been with bowel movements.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with diverticulosis about 3 years ago and maybe that contributes to some of this - maybe?\u00a0\u00a0I have had a couple pencil thin stools but most are not that thin.\u00a0\u00a0If something was seriously wrong, wouldn't they ALL be pencil thin?\u00a0\u00a0I also notice little reddish spots in my stool but am thinking they are food particles.\u00a0\u00a0Wouldn't actual blood be obvious?\u00a0\u00a0Or wouldn't obvious blood be runny and color the water?\u00a0\u00a0I have had a lot of loose stools but they seemed to have firmed up some since I started exercising regularly over the last few weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I do get some slight crampy feelings on occasion but rarely severe.\u00a0\u00a0I also have a slight feeling that I'm not done going even after I've finished and that lasts a few hours.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with type II daibetes about a month ago but have been successful, thus far, at controlling blood sugar with diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Would diabetes contribute to any of this?\u00a0\u00a0I know I've thrown a lot out there but if anyone has any insight on any of this stuff, I'd appreciate reading your comments.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
