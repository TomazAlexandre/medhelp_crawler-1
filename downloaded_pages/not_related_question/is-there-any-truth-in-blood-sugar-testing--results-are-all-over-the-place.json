            "answer": "Our liver also release stored glucose when it thinks the body is starving/needs energy. Have you looked into Low Carb High Fat? I lost 50 pounds that way and brought my A1C down from a 6.7 to a 5.4. I'm also never hungry because I load up on meat, cheese, butter, bacon, avocado, olive oil, nut butters and so much more. I eat less than 30 carbs a day and probably between 100-120 grams of fat.Also blood sugar rises for so many other reasons such as stress, hormones, sickness, weather etc...Meters also have a 10 to 20 percent inaccuracy so your number can be higher or lower than what it shows. It's best to look for a pattern. Try eating more so you're not as hungry, fill up on healthy fats.",

If they are trending DOWN, I would say that is encouraging and working for you. If the numbers are trending UP the u need to review your diet and exercise.",
