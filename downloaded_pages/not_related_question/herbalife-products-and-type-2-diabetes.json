            "answer": "Herbalife makes a number of shakes, none which you identified as your meal. Read the nutrition label. Some have minute amounts of sugar and carbs others not. For example Herbalife - Shake-Formula 1 Fr Vanilla has 13 grams of carbs but 9 grams of sugar, a little over a heaping tablespoon of sugar....not healthy.",

            "answer": "\"how do you know what is safe to take for meal replacement.\"Since this thread is on Herbalife shakes I'm assuming you're asking the same. As commented earlier read carefully the nutrition label. Avoid those with high sugar and high carb contents. If sugar is listed under carbs, I like it it be 1 gram or less. I don't believe in eating fake foods so I cannot comment on what else they put into these shakes. Try eating foods made with whole grains, nuts and more vegies, fish, poultry and lean meats.",

            "answer": "I believe the best way to go about this is talk with a Herbalife Sales person and let them provide for you a testimonial of someone who has used their product to have a positive result on diabetes. You should talk to that person and let him or her show you what, how and when they did it. Anyone who has a positive result about something should be proud to tell the whole world. I know not everyone will get the same result, however, what works for one person should equally work for someone else.I know that Herbalife does work but you have to follow their recommendations strictly. You can really make a major progress in your diabetes control if you change your eating habits. More vegetables, less carbs, less sugar, more exercise, sleep better, have a social life, laugh more and eat less.Drink tea or coffee with no sugar, Drink more Alkaline water. Eat less salt. The above may looks difficult, it's really not because you only need to stick with it for two to three weeks and you will be hooked. Do not think about what your friend will think about you. If you die or get sick tomorrow, who bears the pain, You. You come first.God speed.",
