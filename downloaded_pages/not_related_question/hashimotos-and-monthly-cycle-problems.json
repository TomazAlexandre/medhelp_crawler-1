            "answer": "It would be helpful if you had some idea of what triggered your Hashimoto\u2019s in the first place.\u00a0\u00a0Often it is triggered by an infection, so that is a good place to start.Chronic, systemic infections could also cause the other signs/symptoms that you mention.\u00a0\u00a0Some infections that we have found in situations like yours are:\u00a0\u00a0Mycoplasma species, Chlamydia pn., Ehrlichia species, etc.These infections are growth susceptible to menstrual cycle, due to hormone changes, and they are often suppressed during pregnancy.They are also quite commonly found in thyroid tissue where they cause disregulation of thyroid hormones.\u00a0\u00a0Some patients are hypo and some are hyper in their production of thyroid hormones.",

            "answer": "Your response to TamraW's question was the first time I have ever heard anyone say that an infection could trigger Hashimotos.I was diagnosed with a pituitary tumor 2 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I have been seeing an endocrinologist since then and have developed diabetes and Hashimotos as well.\u00a0\u00a0I take 88 mcg of Synthroid currently, it has been increased from 50 and 75 over the course of the 2 years even though at first those doses worked well.\u00a0\u00a0I worry about it continuing to be increased.I recently had my yearly pap smear and LGSIL and high risk HPV were detected.\u00a0\u00a0I am 31 years old and married.\u00a0\u00a0I know it's possible for HPV to lay dorment for many years (I don't know exactly what \"many\" could mean) but is it possible that HPV could have brought on my Hashimotos... where as this whole time I assumed it was the pituitary tumor.I am also very concerned with my blood count.\u00a0\u00a0My WBC have been high (and climbing higher) for two years.\u00a0\u00a0Specifically my Neutrophils.\u00a0\u00a0My lymphocytes have been low (and getting lower).",

            "answer": "In addition to thyroid infections (thyroiditis), chronic bacterial infections can cause pancreatitis or infection of the pancreas.\u00a0\u00a0Such infections can result in a diabetes-like disease, but one in which there are considerable swings in insulin production.\u00a0\u00a0(My wife has this condition). Thus this condition can be easily confused with type 2 or even type 1 diabetes, but it does not fit the entire clinical profile of either of these diseases.",

    "question": "Hi, Dr. Nicholson! Thanks so much for answering our questions.I was diagnosed Hashimoto's in August, and since then have begun treatment. I am now on Synthroid 75 mcg and Cytomel 5 mcg. My nodules have shrunk to pencil points. My labs and symptoms show I'm still hypo. However, I have hyper symptoms (shaky hands, rapid heart beat, ear ringing) along with hypo (constipation, fatigue) during my monthly cycle. My monthly cycle is also painful and heavy.I have a specialty appointment tomorrow for an abnormal pap. I had endometriosis three years ago, cured with birth control pills, but I'm no longer on the pill.Any thoughts on why I have hyper symptoms during periods, or if any or all of these issues are related?Thanks!:) Tamra",
