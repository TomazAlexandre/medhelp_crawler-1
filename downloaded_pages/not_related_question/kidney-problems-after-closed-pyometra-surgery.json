            "answer": "She may still recover.\u00a0\u00a0It does take a long time for recovery from a catastrophe illness.\u00a0\u00a0It also sounds as if your vet knows what she is doing.\u00a0\u00a0BUN should never be evaluated alone.\u00a0\u00a0It should always be evaluated along with the Creatinine levels.\u00a0\u00a0She may require months of sub Q fluid therapy, which will act as doggie dialysis.\u00a0\u00a0The most important thing is to keep her eating!\u00a0\u00a0Eating and the desire to eat is an important prognosticator of whether or not she is capable of recovery.\u00a0\u00a0If she does not eat there are appetite stimulants that you can still try for her, such as a very low dose of Mirtazipine, available by prescription from your vet.Holistic veterinary medicine may help to give your dog a better quality of life and may help to stabilize her blood abnormalities a bit faster.\u00a0\u00a0 I have personally seen very positive results with adjunctive holistic veterinary medicine for kidney disease.\u00a0\u00a0Please research holistic veterinary medicine websites, such as the American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association website, Chi Institute and others.",
