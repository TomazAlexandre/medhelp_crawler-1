            "answer": "I believe that jobs such as firefighter or police woman are jobs that you probably cannot hold, for they require physicals and excellent health. Also, any kind of military job is out of the question as far as active duty military, for the same reason, but you CAN work for the military as a civilian employee, oddly enough. Most other jobs have no restrictions on whether a person is diabetic or not. I personally have never had any trouble getting a job because of diabetes. It just isn't a factor most of the time.",

            "answer": "Diabetes stands in front of my life everyday. I was a truck driver for 22 years and now have been fired because my body gave me a nice gift of the diabetes. I'm not overweight, I'm not in poor health, and I also excersize and control my diabetes. I was making great money and loved my job. All my education was committed to driving. It's all I know how to do. Now I'm on welfare, food stamps, and make no money at all. I'm taking money away from you because I can't do what I'm good at and only know how to do. This country is terrible and hate its discrimination towards diabetics. \"The land of opportunity\" what a crock.",
