            "answer": "Difficult to say without evaluation.A referral to a neurologist can be considered.\u00a0\u00a0Systemic diseases like B12 deficiency, thyroid dysfunction or diabetes can be excluded, and may cause some of the symptoms you describe.If there was burning in the middle of the chest, an upper endoscopy can be done to comprehensively evaluate the upper digestive tract.\u00a0\u00a0GERD, an ulcer, or inflammation of the esophagus and stomach can be excluded.Some rheumatological diseases like fibromyalgia may atypically result in some of the symptoms.A referral to a neurologist or rheumatologist can be considered to discuss these options.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patients education only.
