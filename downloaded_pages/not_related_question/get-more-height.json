            "answer": "5 foot 5 inches and 110 pounds (in American units)\u00a0\u00a0is \"on the leaner side\" and perhaps smaller side compared to most Americans. However, Sri Lanka natives often have genes that predispose you to not being tall, and a diet (vegetarian based) that also limits your height. The good news is your height/weight (and genes/diet) limit your chances of getting Diabetes or Cancer. The bad news is you aren't as tall and filled with muscles as a Viking. You didn't tell me your job, but if it is \"athletics\" there is a World Anti-Doping Agency list of banned substances, so you wouldn't be able to use any of those. And at 19, you might have a few more inches to grow, but that is it, so even Human Growth Hormone (or its analogs/precursors) would be unlike to help you grow taller. As for muscle, you could eat more protein 25-40 grams per meal, 4 to 5 per day, and do weight lifting exercises, either at the gym or on the farm. I hope this helped!",
