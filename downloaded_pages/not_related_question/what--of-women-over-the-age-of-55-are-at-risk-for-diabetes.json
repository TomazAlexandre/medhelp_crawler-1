Maintaining normal weight2. Exercising regularly3. Eating lower carb diet, and most particularly avoiding foods with added sugars and high fructose corn syrup (Ie. sticking to a diet made of whole and unprocessed foods).Routine screening of both hba1c and fasting blood glucose (ideally on an annual basis) would also allow you to check your sugar levels.Hope this helps.",
