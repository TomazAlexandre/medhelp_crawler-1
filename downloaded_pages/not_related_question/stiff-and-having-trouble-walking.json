            "answer": "It sounds as if your dog may have a partial or complete herniated disk in his spine.Disc protrusions are very difficult to see on regular X-Rays and often times an MRI must be performed.\u00a0\u00a0It is best to see a neurologist at this point because the neurologist is better equipped to diagnose and treat (possibly surgically) spinal problems.Prednisone is a good first choice for neurological problems since it acts an anti-inlammatory and may decrease the size of the lesion, but it takes several days to begin to have an effect.Other common diagnostic possibilities include: a lesion in the brain, Lyme or Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, and hypothyroid disease.\u00a0\u00a0The tick diseases and thyroid disease can be ruled out with blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0There are of course other less common causes also.If it does turn out to be a caused by a disc problem surgery may be one option but acupuncture is also helpful.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your response. We have him on prednisone and an antibiotic for bacteria menigitis (Dr. just wanted to try). I also started him on canned Nutro-Ultra dog food instead of dry. He started improving a little everyday to where is was walking and had little to no problems with his left front paw flipping. Then one day I didn't give him the canned, but dry food and later that evening he was all stiff and having trouble walking again. I gave him some canned food and later that evening he seemed to start to improve. By the next morning he was walking good again (not back to normal) but better since he has been sick. I tried not giving him the canned food again a few days later with the same response. Is it possible he could be diabetic or hypoglycemic and have these kinds of symptoms? We were looking into having a MRI at Texas A&M, but he improved so much. Any suggestions on test by VET should try....any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",

            "answer": "This is very interesting.\u00a0\u00a0Canned dog food has more moisture (obviously), and may have less carbohydrates.\u00a0\u00a0You will have to compare the canned nutrition label to the dry nutrition label to see what the difference is.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have access to their labels at this time.\u00a0\u00a0There is a condition called diabetic neuropathy which could possibly account for your dogs stiffness, and just maybe the canned food has a low enough glycemic index to not set off your dog's diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If this is the case, a grain-free, low carbohydrate canned food such as Evo/Inovo, or Wellness grain-free or even a Nutro grain free, low carbohydrate may be worth a try.\u00a0\u00a0Keep us updated!",

    "question": "Our 6 year old Jack Russell occasionally would become stiff and moved slowly starting in 2003, but within a day he would be back to himself of running and jumping. It has starting happening more often and last longer. On 12/28 I came home and he was all stiff and the left leg paw would flip back as if he didn't know he had a leg. As he would try to walk he would fall over. I rushed him to the vet and they did x-rays, blood work, etc. His glucose level on 12/28 as 266 and on 12/29 it was 66. They thought it might be diabetic, but they now think it might be neurological. We bought him home and giving him predizone, but he still has problems walking. Any suggestions on what could be the cause or what we should do?\u00a0\u00a0This is not a good quality of life for our little guy. Is there some tests to have the vet do or any medications? We are praying...",
