            "answer": "My husband was diagnosed with HIV three years ago. He's on a medication called stribild and he has had VERY FEW issues. It is detrimental that you get on medication quickly! There are so many opportunities you're going to miss in life. Other than having to take his medicine every day and having to eat a little healthier and not drink as much, he lives a very normal life style and his viral counts are undetectable. We can have children as long as he's taking his medicine like normal, of course then I have to go through a couple of tests for the baby but nothing major. He gets help through the state for his medication and pays $5, we live in Texas so that might vary around the states.",
