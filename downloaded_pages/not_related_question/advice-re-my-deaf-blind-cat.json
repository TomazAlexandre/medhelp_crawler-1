    "question": "Hi, my old tom cat who is 20 and arthritic and fairly deaf has recently gone suddenly blind.\u00a0\u00a0We have taken him to the vet who said he has hypertension (he was already on treatment for kidney disease) and he is now on amolodipine.\u00a0\u00a0The vet said he has responded well to the kidney treatment and seems otherwise healthy and should adapt to his blindness in 3-4 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0My problem is he has given up trying to find his litter tray/food/water and howls (he did this as he went deaf but it is now more frequent).\u00a0\u00a0He will stand up and urinate on anything he is sleeping on and I am constantly taking him to his litter tray/ food/ water (He is eating and drinking well once placed there but howls until I check his needs rather than trying to find anything himself). He is generally mopey. In the morning I have to bathe him as he has sat in his own urine.\u00a0\u00a0I guess my worry is that I should not be putting him through all this and he will be on his own most of the day as I work full time normally.\u00a0\u00a0I would really appreciate advice / guidance / opinion from anybody who has experienced similar.\u00a0\u00a0How long should it take for any signs of improvement?\u00a0\u00a0I dont want him to be put to sleep unless this is the kindest option for him as he is much loved, but equally I dont want him to suffer. Thanks.",
