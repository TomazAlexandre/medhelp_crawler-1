            "answer": "Hi Chanda Vukonich,Intermittent numbness and tingling sensation in your arms/hands that later spread to your legs, neck and face can be due to several things:1)\u00a0\u00a0Peripheral neuropathy2)\u00a0\u00a0Myelopathy3)\u00a0\u00a0Demyelinating diseasesThe history and physical examination are key to determining the cause of sensory loss.\u00a0\u00a0There are different patterns of sensory deficits can be help the physician to diagnose the etiology of your sensory changes.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, it is crucial to have a good neurological evaluation by a neurologist.For examples:1)\u00a0\u00a0Sensory loss that is confined to a part of a limb suggests injury to a peripheral nerve, nerve plexus, or spinal root (eg, mononeuropathy or radiculopathy)2)\u00a0\u00a0Involvement of both sides of the body is consistent with a polyneuropathy or spinal cord disease, while involvement of one side is consistent with contralateral disease of the brain (especially the brainstem, thalamus, or cerebral cortex).3)\u00a0\u00a0A sensory level is consistent with spinal cord disease or, more rarely, lateral medullary infarction.\u00a0\u00a0An example of a sensory level at thoracic level 4 is sensory deficits at the level of the nipples and everything below it (front and back).4)\u00a0\u00a0Sensory loss of the face suggests disease above the spinal cord (eg, brainstem, thalamus, or cerebral hemispheres).5)\u00a0\u00a0\"Stocking-glove\" sensory loss is most commonly seen with length dependent axonal neuropathies.\u00a0\u00a0Length dependent axonal neuropathies are seen with:Diabetes mellitusAlcoholVitamin B12 deficiencySyphilisHuman immunodeficiency virusLyme diseaseUremiaChemotherapyVasculitisParaneoplastic neuropathyAmyloidosis6)\u00a0\u00a0Disproportionate loss of vibration sense and proprioception (joint position sense), compared with pain and temperature sensation, tends to occur with diseases of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord (eg, tabes dorsalis, vitamin B12 deficiency, multiple sclerosis) and demyelinating polyneuropathy.You asked about MRI spine with contrast:\u00a0\u00a0An experienced radiologist should be able to see nerve impingment or cord compression with MRI spine without contrast.\u00a0\u00a0Contrast materials are good in diseases such as infection, inflammation (e.g. multiple sclerosis), tumor.For your symptoms, I would consult a neurologist for thorough neurological examination.\u00a0\u00a0I would also recommend to check B12, TSH, RF, ANA, CRP, WSR. HbA1c.Good luck.THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL MEDICAL EDUCATION PURPOSE ONLY.\u00a0\u00a0PLEASE CONTACT YOUR PHYSICIAN FOR DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT OPTIONS OF YOUR SPECIFIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS.",

            "answer": "I had a severe break of my ankle in 2003 after 2 surgeries, I ended up with burning, pins and needles, numbness in my foot and calves. It turned out that I had somehow gotten a disease called complex regional pain syndrome. You should read up on it because it sounds like what I have. Good luck",

            "answer": "Boy do I feel your frustration. Your story sounds as if it could have been written by me. I am a 44, healthy and active woman. I too have as yet unexplained burning, numbness and almost constant tingling in all 4 extremities and around my eyes. My syptoms began 10 months ago. There was no trauma and they were intermitant at first. I think my first symptom was really a year ago when I had such severe itching sensations around my lips I actually went to my doctor. It took until it had spread to my left arm and both feet before I found a doctor who believed there was something wrong. I have been through numerous tests and all come back in the normal range. They have found a torn rotar cuff and deltoid on my left side, but that can't explain my face and feet. I wish you the best, and hope you find real help.",

            "answer": "I feel all of your pain, literally.\u00a0\u00a014 months of burning feet,calves hands and no diagnosis other than - you guessed it - fibromyalgia.\u00a0\u00a0It's not fibro, it's idiopathic peripheral neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0It freaking hurts, but sometimes it goes away for a bit, but then comes back.\u00a0\u00a0I have had ALL tests possible and no answers - even at Duke.\u00a0\u00a0So, the only glimpse of any reason for all of this - I tested positive for active infections of HSV-1, which is Herpres Simplex-1 the cold sore virus - but I have never had a cold sore.\u00a0\u00a0My neuro has a theory (purely speculative) that the HSV-1 has attacked my peripheral nerves instead of manifesting in a cold sore.\u00a0\u00a0I take Famvir, Neurontin and Pamelor and Cymbalta - they seem to make it bearable.\u00a0\u00a0I also tested positive for CMV and HHV-6 - another speculation that my immune system is dealing with these viruses in a strange way.\u00a0\u00a0However, anywhere from 25-60% of peripheral neuropathies are idiopathic (no known cause), so they don't know what causes them!\u00a0\u00a0Thus, if my neuro wants to speculate, I'll listen.\u00a0\u00a0Try some vitamin B12 and Alpha Lipoic Acid too, for non-prescription help.\u00a0\u00a0You can overdose and cause neuropathy with B-6 - so be real careful not to ever take too much of that.\u00a0\u00a0Pre-diabetes and diabetes can cause peripheral neuropathy too - so get checked for that.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and take care!\u00a0\u00a0Try de-stressing too!",

            "answer": "I have had numerous tests. All vitamin and mineral (b12, copper, folic acid, etc, etc.) levels tested normal. No diabetes or pre-diabetes. I had a higher than average ANA (anti-nucleoid antibody) test, but further testing found nothing out of the normal range. That one scared me as it would have put me into an autoimmune disorder. I've had MRI of brain and cervical spine. I also have a prior fusion of C4-C5-C6 (which we thought was going to be the problem at first). It wasn't. The only test that comes back out of normal is sedmimentation of 40 indicates some inflamation somewhere. A year ago it was 8 as it just happened to be have been run during a normal exam. I have been having rather alarming new symptoms this week. I have started feeling like I'm going to pass out. If I stay in one positon too long, it's like I'm drunk when I start to move. Have also started noticing that my feet and hands go numb (like your foot falling asleep) everytime I lay down. That's a different feeling from the tingly burning stuff.Anyway, even though I have no cardio warning factors, my doc has scheduled me for stress test and a tilt table exam. She hopes one or the other will recreate the numbness while lying down at least to see if it could be something cardiac. Personally, I've been wondering if I picked up a virus that has got into my heart or maybe the nerves themselves. I have to wait until the end of the month until I have the tests so just hanging on for now. I'll post more after I get results.",

            "answer": "for those of you who don't have a b12 deficiency please have your iron checked for anemia. I have all the same symptoms and yes it is very irritating especially when your eyes become involved.

Your stories make me want to cry and I will pray for you all.\u00a0\u00a0I have had several mri<s and am going to have an emg test soon, but I do believe that the anemia was my biggest problem.\u00a0\u00a0God Bless",

            "answer": "I was told I had neuropathy or maybe this or maybe that too, a friend told me to go to a chiropractor. I asked my neurologist if he thought it was a good idea and he said he wouldn't go to a chiropractor but it was up to me. My friend talked me into going, what the heck I was told by the neurologist that I WOULD HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE so I figured it couldn't hurt. Well I went and it turns out I had a couple of pinched nerves ( he called them subluxations) and after 2 weeks of treatments\u00a0\u00a0I am almost pain and numbness free. To think I almost went broke going to the other doctors and got no help with my problem and they didn't want me to go to someone that might help me. Then went to the chiropractor and the cost was pocket change compared to the other doctors. I got in the same day I called too..I didn't have to wait weeks or months like I did with the other doc's. I wonder why the neurologist was so biased against the chiropractor....they don't like them so much that they would let me live with my pain just so I don't go to one. I mean isn't the whole idea to help me get better. I don't know...all I know is I'm almost pain free now Hurray!!",
