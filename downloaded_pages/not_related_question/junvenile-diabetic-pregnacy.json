            "answer": "I think her being so young, being young and pregnant is usually considered higher risk and being diabetic are two things that make her a very good candidate for a specialist.\u00a0\u00a0I would ask her endocrinologist for a few names of good OB-GYN's that specialize in high risk pregnancies.I am a Type 1 diabetic, and have had two healthy children.\u00a0\u00a0It is harder when you are diabetic because you must carefully monitor your blood glucose levels too keep them in a good range for the baby and the mother.\u00a0\u00a0If blood sugars are not under control the baby can have a higher birthweight and other complications as well.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetics often have trouble with blood pressure during pregnancies as well.\u00a0\u00a0I am not telling you this to scare you, but I think the more informed you are the better.\u00a0\u00a0I also think making sure you have experienced and knowledgeable physicians will make your daughter's pregnancy a healthy one.",

At first i was petrified, but I overcame my fear and learned it. Last weekend, we were on vacation, and she passed out from her sugar being so hi. Luckily since i was aware of how to give the shots, I was able to stabilize her and get her to help quickly. So learning to do the shots will be a great help.",

            "answer": "I agree that if your daughter is producing insulin (as a type 2) of her own, she may continue to do fine on her Metformin, but the dosage may change. She absolutely should see a diabetes specialist during her pregnancy, for as CB said, there are risks to both mother and baby that can be avoided with good medical care. I, too, am mother to 2 healthy children, and wish her a safe pregnancy. The key is good medical care from someone who knows the special issues that both baby and mom will deal with because of her diabetes.",
