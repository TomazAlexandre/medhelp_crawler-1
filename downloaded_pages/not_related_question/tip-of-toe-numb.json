            "answer": "Welcome to the neurology forum of medhelp. Thanks for writing in. The numbness could be due to tight fitting shoes causing foot compression, foot trauma injury, tarsal tunnel syndrome caused by nerve compression in the tarsal canal in diseases like diabetes, hypothyroidism, arthritis, peroneal nerve irritation or\u00a0\u00a0rarely a neuroma. It might be part of multisystem diseases like leprosy, multiple sclerosis, sciatica, peripheral vascular disease or raynaud\u2019s disease. It could be sciatica or degenerative disc disease. You should check with a neurologist for the evaluation of these causes and treatment of the underlying cause after a local injury is ruled out. I hope this helps.",

    "question": "The upper right tip of my big left toe is numb. Not completely numb, just mostly. It gets a strange, uncomfortable sensation when I touch it. This happened during a day of heavy lifting and lots of walking (10 hours). It has been like this for a month. I started noticing it on that day, but thought the toe just felt strange because of the sock. Now it has been a month and it is still that way. While the work was hard, I don't remember ever hurting my back except for the usual muscular aches later on.",
