            "answer": "HI!Your success with IVF (or anything else for that matter ) will be improved by weight loss. At many IVF clinics, they will give you a better deal (financially speaking) if you are a good candidate for success--meaning if you are young, healthy, and thin.\u00a0\u00a0It may very well be that the hormones are keeping you from losing any more weight.EVERYTHING about your health AND your baby's health will be improved if you can get down to that BMI of 39 that you are hoping for!Obese patients have a higher risk of stillbirth, miscarriage, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, c-section. . .you get my point!Can they tighten the band?Good luck!Dr B",

            "answer": "Hi Elaine,Thanks for answering my question.I think my worded my question wrong. I am 38 years of age, and really thinking about weather I 'put on hold' the baby making for another year, until I am 39 years of age, and go all out and lose as much weight as possible.This is my struggle - do I give away another year and start trying to have a baby when I am 39 or do I try the full on IVF when I am 38 years of age and obese?The band has room for one more fill.Thanks again,CatharinePS I do get your point(s). I know it in my head, my heart is catching up!",

    "question": "Should I just start\u00a0\u00a0IVF? We were referred to a fertility clinic about 9 months ago and I take follicle stimulating drugs and then a trigger to assist ovulation.I've been given some conflicting medical advice re weight loss (ie. yes you should or IVF is a waste of money, and no, you should start IVF now)I had a lap band about 2 years ago and lost 35 kilograms. Since we started seeing the baby-making guru I haven't lost any weight. Not sure why, probably the stress of it all! I do feel if I gave myself 6 to 12 months I could love another 35 kilograms which wold put me in a healthier BMI range. But my then I would be approaching 39.Thanks in advance, I'm feeling a little alone and lonely.PS We don't have any children (yet :-) )",
