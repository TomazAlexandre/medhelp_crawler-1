            "answer": "The CDC purposely needs to state a maximum of 6 months for a reason. (If in doubt you may contact them @ 1-800-342-AIDS).The reason that they need to state 6 months is because they need to cover EVERYONE in the United States (and affiliated provinces/territories/etc.)Remember, they need to cover EVERYONE, this means that most minute person in the country...even the one person out of millions that seroconverts @ 6 months or possibly later (mostly due to some other condition that caused their delay in seroconversion: e.g.: another immune disorder such as lupus or JRA, cancer, bone marrow transplant, etc.)\u00a0\u00a0These persons are EXTREMELY RARE!!!!Since the onset of HIV/AIDS in the early 80's...HIV testing has come a LONG way.Back then it was 6 months...now...99% of infected individuals can be accurately diagnosed with HIV by 6- 8 weeks. The latest being 3 months...unless your physical health was already jeopardized (as I stated above) by a pre-existing medical condition that affects your immune system.The chance you fit this scenario is as much as me waking up as a woman tomorrow and driving to work in a Mercedes.\u00a0\u00a0(just an added joke\u00a0\u00a0 :)\u00a0\u00a0)Your fine.

            "answer": "Scared,I am sorry you are worried still about HIV. A needle stick! That must have been horrible. I've done a fair amount of reading on the subject, here and elsewhere, and everything I've read indicates you are good to go! That's the good news.It seems to me your task right now is not to determine how and when to get tested again. You're real task is accepting the fact that you are not infected with HIV. Your tests appear to be conclusive. Now, you just need to accept that fact. Concentrate on that, not testing.Believe me, I know how hard that can be. You've lived with the fear for 3 long months (I think, based on what you've written). As much as you believe that you just want this all to be over, it can be hard to let go of something you've held on to for that long, no matter how unpleasant. Ever heard the old saying that if you do something for 21 days it becomes ingrained habit? I believe that. And I also believe that anxiety and fear, especially those who are predisposed to them naturally, can become a habit that is as hard to break as any other bad habit. And that, in your case, is what it is: a bad habit.You are quite lucky, you know. There are plenty of people who post and lurk on this forum who are sweating out the months, weeks or days until they can take a 12 week HIV test to end (hopefully) their worries. You have all the assurance you need in the form of your conclusive negative HIV test. Now, take it and try to get on with your life. Easier said than done, I know. If you can't seem to do it on your own, consider speaking to a therapist. Therapy can help you distinguish between valid and irrational fears. And the idea that you still may have HIV is not a valid fear.I'll end this by saying congratulations! You're in the clear!",

            "answer": "A risk is a risk...as far as I am concerned. Whether it be sexual or needle stick injury.I think it comes from the liability of the medical field/medical facility to have the person who was exposed to a needle stick injury to test @ 6 months...since they more than likely stick to the \"old standard\" for legal reasons.Testing @ 13 weeks would be conclusive considered you do not have: Junior Rheumatoid Arthritis, onset of diabetes, Lupus, blood transfusion, or any other medical condition that has impacted your immune system recently.A test for a \"normal\" (and I use that term loosely) individual would have known their positive result @ 6- 8 weeks.I believe health care workers still \"stick\" to the old CDC standard since 1985, which is 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0Any \"normal\" human being would know by 6 weeks as far as I am concerned.I remember several years ago being tested (and this was in 1998), the woman who had tested me said: \"Put it this way, if you were infected with the flu (a virus) , would it really take 3 months to create antibodies to it?\"\u00a0\u00a0Answer: No.I thought this was a great analogy....or isn't it?Brian",

This is the first time I hear about it - my doctor said my glucose level problem i irrelevant for HIV testing. up to 2% of population is affected by diabetes and probably the second half does not know about - is it possible that this can invalidate the modern HIV tests? hard to believe.Dr HHH, I beg you, could you please comment on this issue.

            "answer": "It's too bad there are so many conflicting indicators out there about the testing window!Just to add my two cents, since I did very extensive research on this last summer and the year following.--Dr Handfield's view of the testing window is one of the shortest, citing 6 weeks as a reliable window barring any aggravated risks. That view is shared by massachusetts, I believe. But it is not a common view; very few experts will endorse it.--The 12 week/13 week difference is confusing but mostly deals with finding a number of days that people can easily count. Most calendar months are not 28 days, so 3 months in the calendar sense is 13 weeks, but 3 months in the sense of one month equaling four weeks, makes for 12 weeks.--The vast majority of medical opinions seem to agree on the 12-13 week range, including the states with the heaviest HIV case loads like New York and California.--Nonetheless, the 6-month testing window is not such an outlandish professional opinion as it may appear in some of the discussion above. Lots of leading research centers, like Harvard University's health website, still say 6 months is the window. My PCP in New York has years of experience with HIV and still uses the 6 month window, largely because he _has_ seen people, even with the most recent tests, who tested positive in the 4-5 month range, even without health aberrations. The cases are extremely rare -- for instance, in a clinic that probably administers thousands of HIV tests every year, my doctor has seen a handful of cases over a period of 17 years.--The difficulty with the testing window seems to be anecdotal versus documented evidence. There are many HIV cases with transmission circumstances that can't be confirmed or are kept confidential, thereby never making it into the CDC's registry and never becoming part of the official statistics. Sometimes when people claim to have been infected with HIV from one harmless incident of oral sex, for example, the doctors doubt the truthfulness of the person, so his data is excluded from the data set. Similarly with the testing window, people who claim they haven't had any sex in the last 6 months and suddenly test positive sometimes have stories that don't add up. The result is that you have mixed signals from the CDC and other researchers -- based on what they've seen, they wish they could give a more hopeful picture, but based on what they know might have been excluded from the data, they show restraint and play it conservative.--Having gone through a big HIV scare in 2005, and having gotten tested 16 times in my life so far, I know how stressful these things can be. But I think it's important to differentiate getting an HIV test from thinking that you have have HIV. It's important to have the peace of mind to know your chances are extremely slim that you have HIV if you test negative at 6 weeks, BUT still go and get tested at 3 months and 6 months. If for no other reason, going to get tested at 3 months and 6 months helps the HIV medical field track information better and it will help confirm with greater certainty what the testing window actually is.J",

            "answer": "In general I agree with JohnnyV's comments.\u00a0\u00a0But to clarify (again) my stance on timing of HIV testing, suffers from too much nuance; it breaks a cardinal rule of health education, the KISS principle:\u00a0\u00a0\"Keep it simple, stupid\".\u00a0\u00a0So although I sigh with frustration at having to repeat my views so often, I understand the reasons for misunderstanding.I AGREE WITH 3 MONTHS AS THE TIME FOR DEFINITIVE RESULTS OF THE STANDARD EIA (ELISA) ANTIBODY TESTS AND I ALWAYS HAVE.\u00a0\u00a0However, the reliability of a given test result depends on the prior probability of infection, not only the time interval.\u00a0\u00a0Almost all questions on this topic describe very low risk exposures (say 1 chance in a million, often even lower).\u00a0\u00a0With a negative test that has 90% reliability, those odds drop to 1 in 10 million.\u00a0\u00a0Any common sense analysis says that is low enough to be considered 100% reassurance against infection.\u00a0\u00a0Testing at 6 weeks (and maybe 4 weeks, especially with Duo EIA/P24 testing)meets that 90% standard.I always tell questioners that if this level of reassurance isn't enough, i.e. they remain nervous despite such low odds, they should also get tested at 3 months.To whoever asked about diabetes, it does not affect the reliability of HIV testing.\u00a0\u00a0And although the conditions cited by brian123 (JRA and others) might affect the test results, it's only theory, not proved fact; if they have that effect, it is rare.\u00a0\u00a0And of course the conditions themselves are rare as well.HHH, MD",
