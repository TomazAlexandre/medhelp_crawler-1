            "answer": "Dear Hope,There are several different conditions that could cause urine to leak from your vagina.\u00a0\u00a0One condition is vaginal pooling of urine.\u00a0\u00a0This typically occurs in heavier women with a recessed urethra.\u00a0\u00a0Urine is expelled from the urethra and then pools in the vagina until the woman stands up.\u00a0\u00a0Leakage then occurs.\u00a0\u00a0Another condition is vesicovaginal fistula.\u00a0\u00a0This is an abnormal communication between the bladder and the vagina.\u00a0\u00a0Leakage of urine is directly related to the size and position of the fistula.\u00a0\u00a0The amount of urine leaked can vary between a slight position-dependent drainage and total incontinence.Predisposing risk factors for a vesicovaginal fistula include radiation, C-section, endometriosis, prior pelvic surgery, diabetes, or pelvic inflammatory disease.\u00a0\u00a0The fact that you have had both endometriosis and previous pelvic surgery would definitely put you at an increased risk for a fistula.\u00a0\u00a0The complete work-up for a vesicovaginal fistula should include a urinalysis, urine culture, and an intravenous pyelogram (IVP).\u00a0\u00a0Other tests such as cystoscopy and vaginoscopy may also be needed.\u00a0\u00a0If you do indeed have a fistula, surgical repair may be recommended.\u00a0\u00a0You would benefit greatly from being seen by a Urologist and explaining your problem to him and undergoing a complete history and physical exam.This information is provided for general medical educational purposes only.\u00a0\u00a0Please consult your physician for diagnostic and treatment options pertaining to your specific medical condition.\u00a0\u00a0More individualized care is available at the Henry Ford Hospital and its satellites (1 800 653-6568).Sincerely,HFHS M.D.-BL",

    "question": "I urinate from my vagina. I was urinating regularly up until about a year ago. About 2 years ago I suffered from cronic reoccuring bladder infections (about one every 2 months). I took lots of antibiotics, penicilin, etc. to cure the problem. I have seen my Gynocologist\\OBGYN about this problem and he's one of those doctors that has about 2 minutes to talk and then leaves the room. He did a examined my bladder through a scope and injected water to see where it flowed from. He stood back and scratched his head, said indeed you do have a medical condition, showed his student, then left the room telling his student that there was no cancer but that I had an exceptionally small bladder(??). I rescheduled another appointment and got in about 1.5 months later and he did a quick exam (forgetting about the earlier exam) and said \"you just have a bent urethra tube\". I know this isn't the case because I have examined myself and I know that I am urinating from my vagina because I can expell a tampon by urinating. I have infertility problems (he has operated on my endemetriosis and removed scar tissue that was blocking my falopian tubes).Looking to do my own diagnosing; have you ever heard of such a thing? Is the urinary muscle and the uterus close enough together to become combined? Could this be the cause of my infertility?",
