            "answer": "Hi Joe,A heart rate related (exercise related) left bundle branch block is nothing you need to lose sleep over.\u00a0\u00a0It is true that people with left bundle branch blocks have a higher incidence of cardiac events, but so do people with high blood pressure, family history of coronary disease, diabetes, obesity, smokers, high cholesterol, etc.\u00a0\u00a0This is only a small piece to the pie of your overall cardiac risk. Even people with no risk factors have risk of cardiac events so you the risk is never zero.\u00a0\u00a0If you have a normal echocardiogram and a normal stress test, the only thing you can do is focus on manageable cardiac risk factors like: weight, diet, high blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol, etc.Rest easy of the Christmas holidays.\u00a0\u00a0From what you told me above, I do not think there is any bad news in your near future.\u00a0\u00a0Focus on things you can change. An exercise induced left bundle is not one of them.Thanks for posting and happy holidays.",

    "question": "I had a routine stress test done about a week ago. During the treadmill test my heart went into palpitations after the first 2-2 1/2 minutes. During this time I had shortness of breath but no chest pains. The palpitations subsided as I cooled down from test. Today the doctor went over the results and informed me that, even though my stress test came out normal( no signs of blockage or ischemia) I may have what they call LBBB-Left Bundle Branch Blockage. He stated that in his years of practice he has only seen right bundle branch blockage. He is referring me to another cardiaologist, one who specializes in the electrical workings of the heart. He then tells me that he read up on studies on LBBB and the increased mortality rates. He gave me an echoardiagram after we discussed my stress test results to see if there is anything there. The person administering the echo stated that everything looked good, even though I will have to wait for a week for the cardiaologist to give me the results.From what I can gather is that I have an excersize induced LBBB. I did some research into excersize LBBB and read everything from the condition being serious to condition being manageable. I am 52 yr old male, slightly overweight, dont smoke, rarely drink, borderline high cholesteral, no family history of cardiac disease. Can anyone give me some insights into this?? I am kinda freaked about about what I have read and I will probably have to wait till after the holidays to see the cardiologist who specializes in LBBB. While I have to wait to get the complete examination by the other cardiologist, I am just want some answers on this. Aside from shortness of breath from the stress test I do feel fine. Do you have any insights into this that can ease my fears and worries? Thank you for your help.Joe Sczepanik",
