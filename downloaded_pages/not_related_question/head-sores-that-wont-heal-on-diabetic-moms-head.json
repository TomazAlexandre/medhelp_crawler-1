My blood sugar is in pretty good control, and I have tried everything, and nothing has made the sores go away. They are itchy so I do pick them every once in a while which does not make they heal. Did you ever find out how to get rid of them?",

    "question": "My mother is a diabetic and she recently had a brain stem stroke. Anyway, she was living in the 400's for problem 2 years due to negligence on her diet.\u00a0\u00a0My sister and I noticed that during the past 2 years, she gets these small bumps on her head and she constantly picks at them and they won't heel.\u00a0\u00a0My brother, who is a nurse and also a diabetic, said they were Keloids and diabetics get them.\u00a0\u00a0I think he was sugar coating it b/c I can find no connection between the two anywhere, plus they don't look like a keloid.\u00a0\u00a0They are not from scar tissue, they just look like scabs.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know if these are common in diabetics?\u00a0\u00a0I have heard that sores do not heel good on on diabetics, but I would like to know a cause.\u00a0\u00a0Any connection?",
