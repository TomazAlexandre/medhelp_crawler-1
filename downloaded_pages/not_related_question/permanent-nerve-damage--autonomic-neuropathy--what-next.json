            "answer": "I cannot give you a clinical diagnosis over the internet unfortunately, as this website is purely educationalAutonomic neuropathies are more likely to present with changes in sweating, heart rate, gut motility etcNeuropathies assocaited with burning pain, numbness can be termed small fiber neurpathies and outside of test for conditions like amyloidosis (tesed also by rectal biopsy) and diabetes, most remain undiagnosed. More recently, skin biopsy looking at epidermal nerve fibers has been able to make the diagnosis in some patients. This can be done at Neuromuscular centers such as the Clevland Clinic. Also even when regular diabetes tests are negative, impaired glucose tolerance (early diabetes) may be rpesnet and cause neuropathy.Increased sensitivity to pain is called allodynia and can be also presentin complex regional pain syndrome aka reflex sympathetic dystrophy. This can result from even trivial truama to a limb followed by pain, wasting an autonomic changes in the limb. Ask your doctor about these potential diagnosis and tests for themGood luck",

            "answer": "Have you, in the past year, been treated with a fluoroquinolone-based antibiotic (levaquin, tequin, cipro, floxin, etc)? If so, you may be suffering from an adverse reaction to that drug. These reactions can come on long after you are treated, and cause symptoms like you are experiencing. The use of steroids often exacerbates the effects greatly.Very often those hurt think they have MS, or ALS, or fibromyalgia, or a host of other maladies.If you are suffering these weird symptoms, I suggest you check out the following sites:www.medicationsense.comwww.fqvictims.orghttp://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/quinolones",
