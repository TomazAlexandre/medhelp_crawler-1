            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0High blood sugars cause people to be more irritable and short tempered.\u00a0\u00a0I can tell within a few minutes whether or not my daughter is high after school just by observing her behavior.\u00a0\u00a0It's a typical and common reaction to a medical condition.My suggestion for you would be to test your blood sugar more often, which would allow you to prevent those highs and lows through corrections, and therefore reducing the anger and aggression as well as the seizures.\u00a0\u00a0You could also look at getting a continuous glucose monitor, which is a device that is inserted under your skin and tests your blood sugar automatically every 5 minutes throughout the day, allowing you even better control over your diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0That's more expensive, but it is paying huge dividends for everyone I know using one.\u00a0\u00a0There are currently two models on the market that I know of, one by MiniMed and one by DexCom.\u00a0\u00a0Contact your endocrinologist to find out more information.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

            "answer": "I'm the mom of a 24 year old type 1, and while he is not a thrower, he certainly is more irritable than the average bear when his blood sugar is high.\u00a0\u00a0You are not alone!\u00a0\u00a0the extra testing is a good suggestion\u00a0\u00a0in the above comment, but also check with your endocrinologist about things like high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0My son is also on a low dose of effexor which is usually used to treat depression, but I think it helps protect him emotionally from the ravages of highs and lows.\u00a0\u00a0This is a disease that affects every cell in your body even when it is in good control.\u00a0\u00a0A great magazine is the Diabetes Forecast.\u00a0\u00a0It addresses type 2 issues too, but many of the letters to the editors are from type 1s.\u00a0\u00a0One comment from a type 1 was that when her blood sugar was too high or too low she couldn't make any decisions--which as a\u00a0\u00a0mom I try to avoid any big discussions if I know my son's glucose is out of whack.Keep trying to figure it out.\u00a0\u00a0You are your best advocate, keep asking those questions.",
