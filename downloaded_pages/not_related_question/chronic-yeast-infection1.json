The best way that I know to kill off the excess yeast systemically is to stop eating all refined sugars, decrease fruit intake (limited to low sugar fruit like berries), decrease dairy intake, take hi doses of \"probiotics\" that you can get at any health food store (search out \"Lactobacillus Sporogines\"... this particular strand is especially lethal to yeast) for 1 month, while also taking \"oil of oregano\" daily (this is a powerful yeast killer as well. I have seen this do wonders for women in my practice with similar problems. Good luck!",
