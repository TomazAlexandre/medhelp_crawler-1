    "question": "I am a 43 year old male in good health, non-smoker, do not use drugs, not on any medication, light drinker (glass or two of wine per day). Cholesterol normal, no diabetes or high blood sugar. When I applied for life insurance 4 months ago, tests showed elevated GGT (149). All other liver function tests were (apparently) normal. Fructosamine 1.9, creatinine 0.7, Alkaline phosphatase 54, Bilirubin 0.7, AST 14, ALT 19.Follow up with my doctor repeated these results. I then abstained completely from alcohol for six weeks, and repeated the tests. GGT is now 250. I have no symptoms. I am scheduled for a liver ultrasound in a few weeks, but I am really worried in the meantime. Any ideas about what could be causing this?Many thanks",
