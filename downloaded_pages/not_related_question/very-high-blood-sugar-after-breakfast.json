            "answer": "Hi your rite 216 is very high, then you eat breakfast and it went higher, 108 points higher.216 is high\u00a0\u00a0it could be that your pancreas cant make enough insulin to keep your fasting numbers down.your med forces your pancreas to make more insulin.\u00a0\u00a0If the pancreas is burned out it cant make more insulin.To start do you know how many carbohydrates (carbs) in grams, you ate?whether or not the med is still working can be tested by not taking the med and seeing if your 2 hour BG number has more than a 108pt rise.orhaving your insulin production tested.However since we do know that our body's turn ALL carbs to BG maybe you could eat less carbs for breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0have some eggs instead of toast.But remember\u00a0\u00a0If the pancreas makes extra insulin from taking the pills and you dont eat carbs you could go low.its a balancing actcarbohydrates raise BG insulin lowers it.",

            "answer": "HiI have been looking at your posts the last few days and seems you are always having very high sugars, that are not going down.\u00a0\u00a0You also mentioned that your sugars are usually above 220.Your current medicine is not working sufficiently to control your blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Target blood sugar fasting is < 95.\u00a0\u00a0Ideally in the 80s.\u00a0\u00a0Target post eating is < 140.You blood sugar is more than double normal and this is doing damage to your body.I strongly recommend that you go to your dr and show him your blood sugar data.\u00a0\u00a0He should be prescribing you a different medication, or proably even better at this point, starting you on insulin.\u00a0\u00a0If your Dr doesn't help you address this and take this seriously then you need to find a new doctor.In the meantime you need to cut carbs significantly.\u00a0\u00a0No bread, rice, pasta, fruit, potato, corn, foods with added sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Even things like milk do have sugar.\u00a0\u00a0A better alternative would be plain water, and cream for coffee (no sugar) if you are a coffee drinker.Instead eat non-starchy veges (these are green and salad veges), meat, eggs, cheese, nuts (in small amounts).\u00a0\u00a0 This would follow the paleo eating approach.\u00a0\u00a0Or maybe revised atkins (induction stage).Do go see your dr sooner than later.\u00a0\u00a0If you see sugars consistently in the 300+ range I recommend you go to the emergency room for proper treatment.",
