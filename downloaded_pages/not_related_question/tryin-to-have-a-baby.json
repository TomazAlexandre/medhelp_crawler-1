            "answer": "Hi!One thing to consider is that you may be trying too hard!\u00a0\u00a0TOO much sex can deplete a man's sperm count.\u00a0\u00a0I hate to ruin your fun, but you might want to back off to one time per day.There are lots of other things to check out too.\u00a0\u00a0When someone new comes to me with your question, I generally check to be sure she's ovulating.\u00a0\u00a0I like to use ovulation predictors--those are like home pregnancy tests, and you can get them in the same isle in the grocery store.\u00a0\u00a0I also like to check her tubes with a study called an HSG.\u00a0\u00a0They squirt dye through the tubes and take an x ray.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, I like to check the sperm count of the other half of the equation, to be sure there is not a problem there.Women with diabetes often have thyroid troubles too.\u00a0\u00a0So often they don't ovulate regularly.\u00a0\u00a0One way to know--do you have your cycle every month?\u00a0\u00a0If not, you probably don't ovulate all the time.\u00a0\u00a0Men with diabetes often have trouble with their sperm count.\u00a0\u00a0So you should probably start out with a visit to a gynecologist or infertility doctor.Good luck!Dr B",

            "answer": "Generally, the best time to try to conceive is during the 11th to 17th days of a woman's menstrual cycle, based on a 28-day cycle. Since a man's sperm can live for 48 to 72 hours in a woman's reproductive tract, intercourse every other day during this period is recommended. A study found no difference in pregnancy rates between couples who had sex daily and those who had sex every other day. Hope this helps.",
