            "answer": "Super_Sally888 left some great tips and lots of info. You might consider speaking with your doctor or finding a diabetes educator to work with. A CDE (certified diabetes educator) can work with you to create a meal plan and give you information about to keep your sugars under control with food and lifestyle. There's an organization for CDE's and on their website I think you can search for one iny our area. Asking your doctor or the local American Diabetes chapter is another resource.Diagnosis can be scary. It's a lot of info to learn and adjustments. It sounds like you're doing your best to ask questions, learn and stay proactive. Stay strong!",
