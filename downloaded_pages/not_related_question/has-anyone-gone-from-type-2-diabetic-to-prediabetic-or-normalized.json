            "answer": "I was diagnosed in January with Type 2 diabetes. My A1c was a 6.7. I immediately began to experiment with different diets until I found Low Carb High Fat. I eat less than 30 carbs a day and fill up on meat, fish, chicken, olive oil, butter, cheese, bacon, avocado and nut butters amongst other things. In March my A1C had gone down to a 5.4 and I have lost fifty pounds. My weight is normal now and so is my body mass. I wasn't placed on meds and hopefully can continue to control it with diet and exercise. Even though you're on medication you can make changes and eventually be taken off of them. It's definitely possible! Just takes discipline and a lot of trial and error. My blood glucose meter is my best friend it tells me what I can and can't handle. I test fasting, before meals and one/two hours after every meal.",

            "answer": "You can manage your sugars well enough to no longer need medical intervention (called diet managed), but the underlying condition will always be there. It is dangerous to think it can be cured because then you get lax on management and end up falling off plan. Good luck. I was just diagnosed Tuesday with an A1c of 8.6. Gonna need all my knowledge as an RN to do this.",

            "answer": "Type 2 diabetes may be able to be put into remission with appropriate lifestyle choices, particularly low carb / keto, and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Metformin is a very useful drug.Please know that totally normal blood sugars are typically in the 70 - 90 range.\u00a0\u00a0This should be your ultimate goal (or as close as you can get).Please keep taking the metformin along with the lifestyle changes.I believe that reversing insulin resistance (diet, exercise, metformin) is critical for preventing diabetes progression and complications.\u00a0\u00a0 However, if you do all these things and blood sugars are still higher than normal (and I am a purist, believing that normal blood sugars are our targets), then medications do have a role to play.It is known that diabetes complications proceed progressively as A1c rises above 5.0.Therefore, my personal goal is a1c of 5.0 or less.\u00a0\u00a0My latest a1c is 4.6, which I am very happy with.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have low blood sugars, even though I use insulin.\u00a0\u00a0I\u00a0\u00a0do pay close attention to diet and monitor blood sugars as well.",

They both were very sick. One was almost to the point of losing a toe. Both of them have normal A1C scores after just several months and have lost weight, and no longer on meds. I have lost 90+ lbs on the past year and a half and am no longer pre-diabetic. A1C dropped from 5.7 to 4.9. Blood pressure went from 135/85 to 112/65 within 3 months. Just listen and read and then decide for yourself.",

            "answer": "Diet & exercise is vital to managing diabetes. Lax on exercise & your numbers will show it. But if you aren't regularly exercise causing you must watch your portion & carbs. 1 oz meat breakfast, 2oz lunch, 3 oz dinner & don't eat late. Get enough sleep & water. I use Canadian bacon to stay with my range of meat portions. Eat egg whites for breakfast every day & low carb wraps (Tomaro low carb wraps, or Siete coconut flour or almond flor wraps). I just bought a tortilla press & am going to try to make my own with almond flour & just found a low carb pancake recipe on facebook that I'm going to try- made with almond or coconut flour.I also bought veal scallopini which is thin & light. Next grocery trip will look for chicken cutlets or pre-cut my chicken breasts before freezing so I wcan take out the right portion for meals.",

    "question": "I went in for a physical 3 weeks and found out that my A1C was 10.7! They immediately put me on metformin and I have changed my diet. I use to be a heavy drinker (like 5-10 a day) and ate very horribly. It has been about 3 weeks and I have cutout all alcohol, sugar, and white bread. I started exercising everyday and have felt so much better. I recently just tested my blood glucose levels and I'm averaging 120-130. When I first measured my blood glucose it was near 300. Has anyone been able to get of medication and how long did it take? Thanks for any advice anyone has to offer. I cannot get in to see a specialist for another month.",
