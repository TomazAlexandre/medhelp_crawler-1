    "question": "Hi Doc,Maybe you can give me a clue as to why I'm having these. Last night I opened my eyes at 4 am and saw something similar to a Jackson Pollack's painting. Little squiggles and lines, all moving and changing shape. When I closed my eyes I still saw these but in shades of gray! They lasted for several minutes and dissappeared. I've had night time hallucinations for over 10 years now, sometimes I see complex patterns, like mosaics or tiles changing colors or shapes. A few times I saw hazy snow like a bad tv reception.\u00a0\u00a0 Are these migraine auras or what? I am a 53 yo female, on meds for hypertension and diabetes. Hx of migraine. Any ideas appreciated.",
