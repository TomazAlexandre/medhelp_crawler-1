            "answer": "Hi AJ... It has been a while; I'm sorry to hear you're not doing well.If your current FT3 is 2.97, as in your original post, that doesn't seem so much higher than the 2.7 you say seems to be optimal, but I guess it could be high enough to tip the scale for you.Are you still being treated by the VA?\u00a0\u00a0I thought, at one time, you'd been able to get an outside doctor?\u00a0\u00a0If that's the case, can you get a different one that will pay more attention to your symptoms than to TSH?Another thing is that many people don't do well on Synthroid...I'm not sure if it has to do with the acacia in the tablets or another filler/binder.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't do well on Synthroid, either... If they want you on a brand name, ask if you can try Levoxyl.\u00a0\u00a0Most people do well on Levoxyl.Even though your A1c is in the \"normal\" range, is it high normal?\u00a0\u00a0Do you monitor daily blood glucose levels and keep them well stabilized?\u00a0\u00a0Have you maintained your normal diet?\u00a0\u00a0I'm just asking so we can rule your diabetes out as a cause for the weight loss.",

    "question": "Hi, I was doing really well after TT a few years ago, but the past 6 months, I've been feeling horrid !!!!!\u00a0\u00a03 blood labs my TSH stays at 18 (.34-5.6) has not come down at all for 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0Meds were increased from 162 to 175 to 200 to 225.\u00a0\u00a0TSH still 18 so doc increased to 275, last week.\u00a0\u00a0My TSH is not coming down.\u00a0\u00a0My FT3 and FT4 always in normal range.\u00a0\u00a0FT3 2.97 (2.54-3.9) and FT4 .82 (.57-1.64), for past few years my TSH/FT3/FT4 stays the same.\u00a0\u00a0It all began in Mar 2017, my TSH increased.\u00a0\u00a0I'm having bad symptoms, chest pains, high blood pressure, nervous condition, shaking, headaches, insomnia, etc......\u00a0\u00a0Visit ER 4 times, was admitted overnight for chest pains, heart monitor/stress test normal.\u00a0\u00a0I've also lost 20 lbs.I noticed if I don't take any Synthroid for 3-4 day's my symptoms start to calm down.\u00a0\u00a0I think my body is having a reaction to Synthroid or med is not working.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors will not listen.And my body does not like FT3 above 2.7, reason I know is I kept track over the years, using tracker.Heading to urgent care now, soon as I finish this question.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone has any ideas, truly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
