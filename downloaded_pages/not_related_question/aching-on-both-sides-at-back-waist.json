    "question": "I am 70 yrs. , have type 2 diabetes,HBP ( on meds ), Fybromyalgia\u00a0\u00a0plus Hydrochlorthiazide for fluid. At night , a bit after lying down, will need to urinate with accompanying aching at both sides in back. Afterward, there will be a sort of burning/aching in those areas but eventually it subsides. Also a mild burning in the Urethrea. I usually empty my bladder befor going to bed but will be up at least 2 more times during the night. This usually doesn't bother me during the day.\u00a0\u00a0Have been treated for Urinary infections off and on for 40 years but this does not seem to be showing an infection, at least not to be seen. I don't have that \" urgency \" or feeling of not being able to pass urine as with other infections.Would this indicate any Kidney involvement ?PJ",
