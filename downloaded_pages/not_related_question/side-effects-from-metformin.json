Starting late yesterday afternoon I got extremely tired and my back started to get sore, by night time my lower back was painful and my muscles were crampy and sore. Today I have not been able to do much I am so sleepy. I have also not been hungry or feel like eating. Did anyone else feel any of these things when starting metformin?",
