            "answer": "Hello,Prednisone can indeed cause some short-term rise in blood sugars, as well as the infection itself causing hyperglycemia.YOu can speak with your doctor abut temporarily increasing the dose of some of your diabetes medications to keep it under control. Dietary changes can help as well, including increasing your water intake and further restricting sweets and simple carbs. I suggest contacting your doctor if you notice sustained glucose numbers over 200 during the following days. A short-term rise in blood sugars is not generally harmful unless it becomes very high and is accompanied by dehydration,ketones, confusion, vomiting, abdominal pain, or is unresponsive to your medications.Stay in close contact with your doctor during this time, and do not hesitate to ask questions.Take care.",
