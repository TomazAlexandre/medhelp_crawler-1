(I am slightly heavier than I should be also, but not much)\u00a0\u00a0Sound familiar?I went to the doctor last week and she seemed concerned with all this so she took bloods and checked for diabetes, tsh levels, rheumatoid issues, and vitamin levels.\u00a0\u00a0Everything came back perfectly normal except that my vitamin B12 levels were on the low side (I came in at 275, which is in the normal \"range\" but still on the low side... normal range is from 245 to above 2,000).\u00a0\u00a0B12 deficiencies can cause numbness in your finger tips and toes along with some other issues and are common in people with hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0I went out and got B12 supplements today that you dissolve under your tongue and I have an appointment to get a B12 shot on Monday.\u00a0\u00a0She seems fairly certain this will correct the problem.\u00a0\u00a0If by chance it doesn't, the next step will be to see a neurologist.Based on the similarities here, I would definitely tell your doctor and ask to be checked... it is a simple blood test.\u00a0\u00a0If there is a B12 deficiency and it is not taken care of, it could realistically cause long term problems that could easily be avoided.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this information helps.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for taking the time to relay this information to me!\u00a0\u00a0You know, in my quest for answers I have seen the B12 issue come before and I have dismissed it for some silly reason.\u00a0\u00a0I will definitely look into it.\u00a0\u00a0I think it is so crazy how similar our symptoms are - and the fact that we are both hypo and want to lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0Not to mention that we have the same name!\u00a0\u00a0Would you be interested in chatting in the future?\u00a0\u00a0If so, I can send you my e-mail address.Thanks again!Katie",

    "question": "I have been having numbness in my big toe and sometimes on the tips of my fingers.\u00a0\u00a0I am not a diabetic, but I am overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I bought one of the blood sugar monitors and my fasting levels are at about 89-95.\u00a0\u00a0My 2-hour post-meal glucose levels are between 110-125.\u00a0\u00a0However, I must admit that I have been eating very well over since getting the blood glucose monitor.\u00a0\u00a0Is there a chance that the numbness could be pre-diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0I also have hypothyroidism, which is under control.\u00a0\u00a0Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.Regards,Katie",
