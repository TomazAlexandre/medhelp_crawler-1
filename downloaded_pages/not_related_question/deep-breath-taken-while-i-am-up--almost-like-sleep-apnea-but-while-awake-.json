    "question": "I am a 39 year old Hispanic/Native American woman, mother of 6 at 5'4 and am overweight. For over a year and half I have had trouble with my breathing, I noticed it while i was awake and talking to my daughter that I gasped for breath, it wasnt painful but scared me very much. I thought what was that, and since then it has been happening. It can be when I am sitting, relaxing, walking, talking, sleeping, at anytime it does it unconsciously. It happens while I am sleeping as well, I am really worried about this. I have a lot of cancer in my family as well as diabetes. My mom is a cervical and breast cancer survivor and my dad passed on from colon cancer at age 58.I have lost 2 brothers to colon and stomach cancer, my two nieces ages 24 and 28 to leukemia and melanoma cancer, my nephew who had cancer in his bone, thankfully they caught it due to a infection in his leg, and his leg was amputated. My niece who is 28 just found out she has melanoma cancer that has already spread. I myself suspect I might be diabetic now, as\u00a0\u00a0my mom and dad and sibling were or are. I am really worried if this has anything to do with my lungs or is it something else. Please anyone who might have an answer, I am desperate",
