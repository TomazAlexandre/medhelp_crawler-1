            "answer": "HelloHow are you? I want to answer your question correctly so I need to clarify that youre asking me why does no one recognize diabetes as a risk factor for heart disease? Is that what youre asking? If that is what youve been denied compensation for, that is an error. Diabetes is clearly a risk factor for heart disease and diabetic eye retinopathy as well as stroke and limb loss. Please clarify if that is your question and if it is you should appeal the decisionThere is some controversy regarding the relation of agent orange and cardiomyopathyAgain. please clarify to make certain that I have addressed your concern. Thanks and good luck",

            "answer": "I think that you have a valid arguement that diabetes contributed to development of ischemic cardiomyopathy, irregardless of the fact that you did have Coronary artery disease and triple bypass.\u00a0\u00a0At the time that you had your bypass, depending on the condition of your heart and its function, you may not have had cardio myopathy. I would appeal. I think you have a strong case. God Bless, good luck and thank you for your service to our country",
