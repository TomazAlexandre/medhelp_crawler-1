            "answer": "You have certainly been through a lot over the past years and pain is a very difficult thing to live with. There is no simple answer but here are some suggestions you might consider.Go back to the people who inserted the pain pump and explain your continued pain and see what they have to say. If they don't have an answer, ask for a second opinion.Join a mind body program or good yoga class where you can learn relaxation techniques. These won't make the pain go away but can give you some excellent tools for dealing with pain and possibly reducing it.See a mental health professional. It is very normal to feel down, defeated or depressed with such a challenging problem. The therapist should be able to work with you to deal with these feelings. They might also be able to help you with sleep. Chances are if you are in pain that you are not sleeping well and poor sleep leads to increased blood pressure, pain, diabetes and depression.Machelle M. Seibel, MD",

            "answer": "I just wanted to say that I had my hysterectomy 16 yrs ago and my pain pump was 2 months ago, they put morphine in it (before that I was on methadone) now they are switching to diluadid. I cannot even hold my bladder since they did that pain pump and I got Cdif after the surgery. yes I have been thru alot and thanks for your advise, do you think Morphine could cause this depression/crazy mood as well? Do you hear better things about Diluadid? I just dont know where to turn anymore, too many Drs and not enough of one thing I guess , thanks again, have a good Holiday if I dont hear back.",

    "question": "I had no idea that anyone else got sick after a TOTAL Hysterectomy. I had mine when I was 32 yrs old and within 2 yrs I got sicker and have gone down hill since. I do have a type of MDystrophy called Myotonia Congenita and have had my neck at level C56-C67 fused. I also recently from pain (extreme leg pain, they thought was from my MDys) had an intrathecal pain pump surgically implanted in me. I dont understand why it isnt controlling my pain. I still hurt daily and I and crying all the time, moody, want life to be over,etc. How do I know if I could be in menopause this many years after the hysterectomy? Why dont my Drs tell me that magnesium could help with leg pain......all the rest of the other helpful ideas as well.\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone tell me anything or anyone to see for help. I am so spinning in what to try.....my moods I guess are what are hurting me the most....",
