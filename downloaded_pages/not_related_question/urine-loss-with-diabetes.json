            "answer": "Your vet is right, this urinating excessively (polyuria) is caused by the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It does take quite a while in some cases to stabilize a cat with the right type and dose of insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Could be months.\u00a0\u00a0Once on the right dose and blood sugar normal you should see the polyuria subside.The other cat showing aggression is a common behavior toward a sick animal.\u00a0\u00a0I would try to keep the two apart if you can as your sick one does not need the extra stress of dealing with that, nor a fight.clean up your house with a good enzyme odor and stain remover like Simple Solution.\u00a0\u00a0this will help keep your other cat from marking over these spots.You do need to work very closely with your veterinarian to find the right dose for the insulin.\u00a0\u00a0keep regular on the diet and very regular on the injections.The liver should be monitored because of that spike, but may very well have been an transient toxicity.\u00a0\u00a0Glad it is down now.",

    "question": "My cat was diagnosed with diabetes about a month ago.\u00a0\u00a0He was up to 9 units of Vetsulin and his blood sugar was still over 500.\u00a0\u00a0The vet switched him to PZI at 4 units twice a day.\u00a0\u00a0For the last month he has been losing urine.\u00a0\u00a0If he lays in a spot, when he gets up his fur on the back of his legs is wet.\u00a0\u00a0His bladder gets huge and when I find the wet spots I take him to the litter box and he goes and goes and goes.\u00a0\u00a0One day he walked on the counter and was dripping urine the whole time.\u00a0\u00a0The vet has told me that this is a sign of diabetes and should clear when his blood sugar goes normal,\u00a0\u00a0How long will this take.\u00a0\u00a0Our other cat is having a fit and acting aggressively at times toward the one with the issues.\u00a0\u00a0I am so sad about this.\u00a0\u00a0Can you tell me your opinion.\u00a0\u00a0He had a liver count of 5700 2 months ago but with treatrment we got that down to 77.\u00a0\u00a0The vet believes since it came back down so quick, and has stayed down, that he may have found one of our pills on the floor and ate it.\u00a0\u00a0I lost a cat in April, and I dont want to lose another.",
