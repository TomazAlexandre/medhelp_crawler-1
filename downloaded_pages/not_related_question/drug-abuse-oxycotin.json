    "question": "I have been addicted to painkillers for over 9 years. My choice of painkiller was Oxycotin 20 & 40 mg is what I had access to, but any opiod would due, I took over 600 mg of oxycodone per day, (all I could get I would do). I have been off the pain pills for 2 yours as of 8/8/2007. But my health is failing; eye sight bad, hearing bad, short term memory gone, joints hurt (all), teeth are rotting out of my mouth, skin rashes/sores, bowels are blocked, & so on. Here is the question: Is my health issues all caused by the pain pill abuse and what else will fail? Please tell me what more to expect?J_cee",
