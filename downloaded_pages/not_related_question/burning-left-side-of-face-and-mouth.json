            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine you and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of your symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.If there is sensory loss on the face with objective evidence of dysfunction of the nerve that supplies innervation to some areas of the face, the 5th cranial nerve or trigeminal nerve, imaging to exclude a problem is indicated (such as a small tumor or some other lesion affecting this nerve). This imaging is ideally done with contrast (dye). More commonly, symptoms in the mouth predominantly could be due to burning mouth syndrome. Burning mouth syndrome is a disorder that is characterized by burning within the mouth (tongue, inner cheeks, but sometimes also lips and extending into the face). Some causes include diabetes and vitamin deficiencies, which it sounds like you have been tested for. In some cases, a cause can not be found, but treatment does include lyrica, amitryptiline, and other medications for neuropathic pain.Continued followup with your neurologist is recommended.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
