            "answer": "Thanks for the question. It sounds as if your father had a positive stress test followed by a cardiac catheterization which showed severe disease or blockages in his coronary arteries. From what you describe, his doctors suggest coronary artery bypass grafting surgery rather than angioplasty or stents. Studies have shown that this bypass grafting is a better option for overall survival than stents when multiple coronary arteries are involved. Without known the full details of your father's coronary artery disease, it is difficult to say if there is a role for another non- surgical option such as management with medication or stenting. Your father does have at least one major risk factor for coronary artery disease, since he has diabetes. It is very possible that can have severe blockages and not ever had symptoms or a heart attack. In fact, diabetic patients often have no symptoms of angina, or unusual angina symptoms.",

            "answer": "thank you so much..this was very helpful..we just got his angiography done..and doctors say his left proximal coronary artery severe\u00a0\u00a0blockage at 2 locations and\u00a0\u00a0right one has some narrowing.his echo test of the heart showed some very slight kinetic movement..so i guess yes he needs\u00a0\u00a0a bypass surgery....so how long much time do you think we have to get his bypass done?and what care should we take to keep his condition under control until he gets his bypass done,,since we need time to consult several doctors to select the best one for surgery.....thank you very much",
