    "question": "Since the beginning of April I have been on Steroids three times orally and once was given intravenus steroids in the hospital when ITP required that I have a platelet transfusion.\u00a0\u00a0I have been off the last dose for about two months.\u00a0\u00a0Here's the problem, I have gained a total of 25 pounds with the last 10 in the past two months.\u00a0\u00a0My Hematologist tested and says that my thyroid is within normal limits as of a few months ago.\u00a0\u00a0I have been dieting (eating 5 times a day, about 1500 cals) and working out 5 days a week.\u00a0\u00a0I have not lost one single pound and I'm on my fourth week.\u00a0\u00a0This is the first time in my life I have not had control of how my body is responding to diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any suggestions such as seeing an Endocrinelogists?\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible that my body is battling within itself with the ITP and hanging on to everything it can...including weight?\u00a0\u00a0I know this sounds ridiculous but I'm at a loss what else it can be or what I can do!",
