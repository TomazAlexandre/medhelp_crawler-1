            "answer": "The most common diagnosis would be polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) that would cause most of these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Would also test thyroid function.\u00a0\u00a0May be best to have an endocrine evaluation unless your primary doctor is comfortable testing for PCOS and testing for things that mimick PCOS (cushings, prolactin overproduction, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, acromegaly, etc)....Would also ask why low B12 -- if it was very low, then pernicious anemia should be considered.",

            "answer": "you should get a copy of your \"normal \" thyroid bloodwork, make sure that a FREE t3 and FREEt4 were done , your doctor could just be doing a tsh test , which sometimes is still in normal ranges, when your actual thyroid levels are low. also he could be going by the normal range for the tsh test that was changed. some lab slips still list it up as high a 5 to be normal , it was lowered to 3 in 2003, then again later to \" suspect hypo if tsh is over 2.5.",

            "answer": "hi,sounds like it could be PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0This is contributed to by insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0Treatment is metformin (which helps the insulin resistance), diet low in refined carbs, and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes birth control pills are also used as part of the management, but shouldn't be used instead of the first three, which are first line treatment.As mentioned by Dr. lupo, You need to see an endocrinologist and get a full endocrine work up to identify what is going on and also so that you get appropriate treatment as although you may have PCOS they need to check for other things as well, including pituitary.Best regards",
