            "answer": "Several things come to mind which may lead you in the right direction. Getting an MRI is a good idea as worsening headache over 40 along with your other symptoms and family history (sometimes AVMs run in the family) - its encouraging that it is negative. The one white spot is probably incidental, although I have not seen the MRI and cannot confirm this.One is are you getting enough sleep - sleep deprivation could easily cause the above symptoms, do you have symptoms of sleep apnea - snoring, biref periods of cessation of breathing at night leading to tiredness during the day. Crystal in the ears refers to otolith disease - an inner problem that produces positional vertigo and nausea, diagnosable by neurological inner ear testing. Migraine (previous headaches may have been milder migraines unrecognised?) can cause nausea, headache, and can be triggered by certain stimuli ?odors in the car, foods, weather. Blurry vision while driving at night can mean a loss of peripheral vision - have your eyes checked out by an eye doctor and be evaluated for benign intracranial hypertension. Avoid caffeine and alcohol.A neurologist can check for all of the above possiblities and would be a useful consultation",

            "answer": "Normally I wouldn't post a comment before the doctor offers his/her thoughts, but I wanted to mention that my mother has had the same symptoms, except that it's happened not only while driving.\u00a0\u00a0Her dizzy spells were caused by a diabetes medication (prescribed to protect her liver) that caused her blood pressure to drop too low.\u00a0\u00a0After the doctor reduced that dosage, the dizzy spells stopped.\u00a0\u00a0I bring up diabetes because you mentioned a history of stroke in your family, and diabetes can be a big factor.\u00a0\u00a0My mom had also had carotid artery surgery to remove a partial blockage.\u00a0\u00a0They insist the blockage wasn't related to the dizzy spells but I mention it anyway because the surgery was done around this same time.\u00a0\u00a0Could be coincidental but the doctors do believe it was because of low blood pressure.My uncle (not her blood brother) has also had 2 similar spells.\u00a0\u00a0He actually fell out of his chair but he gets to the point where he's barely responsive (we called 911 the first time because we thought he was having a stroke).\u00a0\u00a0He's also diabetic and takes the same liver protection, and coincidentally, has also had carotid surgery.\u00a0\u00a0It's too soon to know if the same medication was the reason (they JUST reduced it).",

    "question": "I am a 43 year old Female. 5 weeks ago while driving at night something happened, I got very dizzy, blurry vision, nausea, and headache. This came on very sudden. Since then I have continued to have the same symptoms, they come and go. I went to my Dr. he did blood tests, which came back normal. I have a history of Stroke in my family, my Dad died of a Massive Stroke my Mother had a Stroke (AVM) that ruptured, she requires a lot of care. My sister, 3 years older had a MRI a couple of years ago, her Dr. told her she had a Sroke at some point. When this happened to me I thought maybe it was a Mini Stroke. I also went to a ENT to rule out Ears causing symptoms. The PA I saw said from my symptoms I had Crystals in my Ears and I would need to be repositioned, which I had never heard of. I had Hearing and Balance Tests, tested Pressure in Ears, he said everything was normal, I did not have Crystals. My MRI said- Imprssion, Essentially negative MRI brain with incidental subcortical T2 signal abnormality in the posterior left frontal lobe. Such changes are often demonstrated in patients who report a history of chronic recurrent migraine. Negative MRA brain.\u00a0\u00a0Please tell me what those results mean, I have had headaches, but I have never had a Migraine. I want to know if I should see a Neurologist, or what suggestion you have. I continue to have trouble driving especially at night,while driving, I feel off balance, dizzy, and I seem to zone out a little bit. It seems to be affected by speed, not as bad at 35 mph, but gets worse at 65 mph. I would appreciate your suggestions, Thanks.",
