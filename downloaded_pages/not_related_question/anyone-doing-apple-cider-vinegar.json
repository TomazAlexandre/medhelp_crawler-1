            "answer": "I am new to this, only learned of my A1C being high (7.1) about a month in a half ago. So I bought a meter and started tracking my glucose. I found in the morning that I was over 200 but the rest of the day I was closer to 120-130. With diet changes I could get my morning reading to the 160 level. I read about apple cider Vinegar helping so I decided to try it. I take two table spoons of distilled apple cider Vinegar in a small\u00a0\u00a0glass of water before bed and my readings seemed to drop about 20 points for me the next morning. So now I am averaging around 135-145. I still have more work to do but it really seems to help.",

    "question": "So I have a co-worker who does shots of apple cider vinegar every day and talks about all the health benefits.\u00a0\u00a0I decided to research into it and am starting to give it a try.\u00a0\u00a0It's supposed to be helpful in lowering blood sugars.I've seen articles and videos online about adding it to your drinking water and to sweeten with lemon juice and or honey and or stevia if you can't stomach the taste.\u00a0\u00a0Well, honey would be out, and I did try with lemon juice and stevia but it's just still too strong for me.\u00a0\u00a0So, like my co-worker, I do a shot.\u00a0\u00a0In my case though I don't do a full on shot, I fill my shot glass with 1/2 acv and 1/2 water, and chase it with a big glass of water!Anyway I have to admit I haven't been controlling my diabetes as well as I should be and don't test as often as I should but I'm changing all that now.\u00a0\u00a0So until I know my patterns I don't really know how well or if the acv is helping, yet.Does anyone else here do acv in any format? Shots, in your drink, as a pill?",
