            "answer": "If you haven't seen a doctor already you should go for a check-up. Elevated liver enzymes are due to liver cell injury and/or bile duct injury or blockage (the channels inside/outside your liver that carry bile). Bilirubinuria is due to slowing down or blockage of bile inside these ducts. These could both be associated with your tylenol usage..or they could be associated with hereditary diseases like Gilbert's or Crigler Najjar, which involve failure of an enzyme that \"adds\" bilirubin into bile inside the liver so your body can get rid of it in the feces. You should also be tested for hepatitis. I don't know about the muscle crampings, aches, and fatigue, but muscle cramps and \"skipped heartbeats\" are affects of imbalances (too much or too little) electrolytes (chemicals like sodium, potassium, and calcium.) Watch the intake of your water, salt, etc.",
