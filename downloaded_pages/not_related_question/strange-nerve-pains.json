            "answer": "Hello.It will be premature to consider these symptoms to be due to MS.Twitching and nerve pains throughout the body suggest neuropathy. There are various possibilities.Some patients are diabetic, some have electrolyte disturbances, and some have vitamin deficiencies.You have mentioned that you have hypothyroidism. What is the cause of your hypothyroidism ? Some hypothyroid states are associated with peripheral neuropathy.How did you first notice that you might be having a nerve pain ?Have you ruled out diabetes ?Regards",

            "answer": "Hello,Thanks very much for your response.\u00a0\u00a0I am 26 and have had no health issues until now.I have not ruled out Diabetes. Would this have shown up in my bloods?I did ask the doctor if my vitamin B12 level looked normal as pernicious anaemia runs in my family. She said it was.I do not know the cause of the hypothyroidism. Can this be determined from the bloods?The pains first started in October. They initially felt like twinges in my arms, legs, feet and hands. They then started to feel like electric shocks running through my arms, legs, feet and hands. It was a couple of weeks later the face and head pain started. The are of the same nature. The pain in any one place only seems to last seconds and then goes away. I get the pains daily. Its seems worse at night though. I also get a dull ache in my lower back on the odd time but not prior to the pains starting,My doctor is sending me to an endocrinologist now to see if hypothyroidism could cause the pain. Could this be the case, I thought this only caused neuropathy in the arms ( carpal tunnel)?Thanks so much for your response.",

    "question": "I have been getting shooting nerve pain daily for the last 3 months in my arms, legs , face and head.I also experience twitches, about 3-4 a day.These pains are not debilitating but have woken me up sometimes at night.Could this be MS or is there any other thing that could be causing this? I am very worried.I have blood tests\u00a0\u00a0done. These show I have hypothroidism. Only just below normal though. I am not on medication for this.",
