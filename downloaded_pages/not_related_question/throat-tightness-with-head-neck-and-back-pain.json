            "answer": "Your symptoms are obviously severely affecting your lifestyleAlthough I cannot offer a complete evaluation, I will make some comments based on the information hereHave you had an evaluation for obstructive sleep apnea? - this can cause mouth breathing (dry mouth in the morning), feeling of being unrefreshed in the am, with daytime sleepiness, frequent nighttime awakenings. This can be evalauted with a polysomnogram (sleep study) , which involves staying overnight at a sleep facility and having your breathing, movements, sleep and brainwave activity measured.Diabetes can cause a range of peripheral nerve problems, which can even occur in the face of 'normal' glucose levelsit can be difficult to diagnose, but a center that does skin biopsy looking at epidermal nerve fibers can do this.Of course, structural disase ie a mass or growth causing the pain and discomfort should be evaluated with radiological imaging.The Cleveland Clinic is among center that can do both the sleep study and the 'neuro'-skin biopsy on a routine basis.It is unlikely that the vagus nerve is involved as long as a strucutural lesion is ruled outGood luck",

Most of my pain was in the back of my head and between my shoulder blades.\u00a0\u00a0The one question I was asked several times when all this was happening was whether I had any problems swallowing.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to get a cervical MRI.\u00a0\u00a0There is a lot of similarities between your symptoms and mine. Depending on what disc and how bad, you can definately have swallowing issues along with your other pain symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest this.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

    "question": "I have had this on-going problem for about 4 years; I have throat tightness and dryness which inhibits deep breathing which is accompanied by pain in base of head, neck and upper middle back.\u00a0\u00a0I have been through a myriad of tests including pulmonary, ENT, neurological examination with EMG all with out a diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0I am also a diabetic with well controlled glucose levels.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that this may be caused by autotonic neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0I am despaeratley seking answers as this has altered my life considerably.\u00a0\u00a0I used to be able to run 7 miles a day and I thoroughly enjoyed being active and physical activity.\u00a0\u00a0Now I continue to do physical activity but without the pleasure or the endurance I once had. When a wake up in the morning my whole body aches and I rarely sleep through the night without waking one or two times. I rarely feel refreshed and I just cannot get the \"second wind\" type refreshing deep breath. I notice I feel worse after I eat certain items but any type of food usually starts the feelings.\u00a0\u00a0I had Laparoscopic Nissen Fundoplication in August 2003 after being told it \"could\"e cause by reflux aspirating into my lungs.\u00a0\u00a0This has not changed the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Could the vagus nerve be involved?\u00a0\u00a0Would ask for a recommedation of facilty which may be able to assist in a diagnosis.",
