            "answer": "The teeth are generally loose because the tissue is inflamed and there's plaque/tartar underneath that needs to be removed.\u00a0\u00a0As those things are removed, there's spaces now and when they are sutured over, the tissue needs time to reduce its swelling and re-attach back onto the clean root surface.\u00a0\u00a0Once it re-attaches back on, the teeth tend to tighten up more.",
