            "answer": "In order to answer this question, it is important to understand why you might be taking the metformin. If you do not ovulate regularly, and after you start to take metformin it helps you to ovulate, the it will help you to get pregnant since it's main reproductive benefit is to aid women who do not ovulate regularly to ovulate. If you are already ovulating regularly and are having regular periods, then metformin will not help you to get pregnant. Of course, if you need metformin for other reasons, such as diabetes, then you should take it regardless.",
