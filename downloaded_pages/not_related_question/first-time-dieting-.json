            "answer": "Its good to know that you like eating fruits. If you have cereal for breakfast, include one apple or a banana along with it. You can also eat any other local fruit. For lunch or dinner, you can have fish, turkey or chicken breast. These are lean proteins and will provide nutrition to your body. For dinner, you can bank on a bowl of fruit salad and milk or boiled lentils (don't throw the water away). You can use vegetable stalk to boil the lentils. Its a myth that if you completely avoid carbs you are going to lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0Our body is made up of proteins, carbs and fats (and other chemicals too). Therefore a little carb or fat is essential for our body to function properly. You can have potatoes or brown rice. However, deep fried potatoes are not healthy as deep frying kills all the nutrition and the oil (reused) tend to make your cholesterol levels on the higher side. You can also drink fresh fruit juices and eat whole fruits. Packaged fruit juices have added sugar which will not help you to lose weight.",

            "answer": "Be mindful of what you eat.\u00a0\u00a0The first week there is no dieting - use this app to track every single thing you eat each day. Pay attention to your\u00a0\u00a0portion sizes along with the calories and nutritional content of each item you've eaten. The second week keep eating the foods you do like that are also nutritionally dense. Reduce/ eliminate the\u00a0\u00a0food items that are of little or no nutritional value or find healthier versions of them e.g. - if you're eating yogurt with fruit already added to it probably has unwanted fat and sugar which means empty calories. You can switch to a low fat plain yogurt and add your own fresh fruit to it. Potatoes are healthy it's what we put on them (butter, sour cream, cheese, bacon) that make them \"unhealthy\".\u00a0\u00a0Choose lean meats.",
