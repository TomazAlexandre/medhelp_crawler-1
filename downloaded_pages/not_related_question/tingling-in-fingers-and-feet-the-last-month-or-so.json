            "answer": "Hello~I know you really don't want to see a doctor, but, since this issue could be due to diabetes, nerve impingement, mineral or vitamin deficiency, I think a visit is in order.\u00a0\u00a0If all tests prove there is nothing wrong, then, I highly suggest seeing a chiropractor. Lots of time tingling and burning can be compressed nerves and a few simple adjustments can clear the matter up in a few short months.Hope you feel better soon.God bless you",

    "question": "I had a quick question, so if anybody has experienced similar symptoms, please do chime in. For the last month or so I have been experiencing a tingling sensation in my fingers and feet and shin area. In no way is it painful, but it is quite a nuisance and I am trying to figure out what it may be. I understand that a doctor visit would likely help rule out possibilities, but given that something like this has been occurring almost daily, I figured I'd ask the forums at my most likely scenario and cause. I am a 30 year old male, in relatively good shape, whom walks or jogs daily. I have just a little weight to shed as I have a small belly and am 6 foot 3 and around 215-220lbs. I have read online that it can be poor blood flow, diabetes, MS, vitamin deficiency or nerve problems. I am just wondering what my most likely cause be given that it has been consistent the last month + but doesn't hurt/burn like other sensations in the body may. Thoughts, ideas?Thank you!",
