            "answer": "Hello doctor, I am 53, 5' 9\", 215 lbs. I was diagnosed with diabetes and HCV type 1a in 2001. Platelet count was 150,000 at that time. My liver biopsy in April 2002 showed stage 2, grade 2. I had an svr in 2006 and thought this was behind me now. CT scan and ultrasound in Oct of 2007 revealed mildly enlarged spleen(14cm) and no other abnormalities.\u00a0\u00a0Well, the abdominal pain never really went away and I returned to see the hepatologist in Jan of 2009. Platelet count was 186,000 and my second liver biopsy came back at stage 1, grade 1, in Feb of 2009. Lab tests in Nov 2009 indicated platelets at 134,000. Now in last week labs were: Platelets 124,000, HCV RNA-Neg, ALT-28, AST-18, Albumin-4.3, T bili-.5, D bili < 0.1,\u00a0\u00a0RBC 4.56, WBC 6.73, HGB 13.5(low),HCT 40.0, MCV 87.7, MCH 29.6, MCHC 33.8, RDW 13.2,\u00a0\u00a0Bun 8 (low), Creatinine 0.8, NA 141, K 4.1, Protein 6.4,\u00a0\u00a0Alk Phos 39, Anion Gap 12, Lymphs 41.9, Monos 8.3 (high), EO% 1.5, BA% 0.6, Neut % 47.7 (low), HGBA1C 6.8 (high), Chol 157, Triglycerides 297 (high), HDL 24 (low), LDL-DIR 95. Any suggestions on what may be going on and what my next step may be? With the abdominal pain/discomfort and the trend in platelete reduction, if there is anything on my side to do, I am going to do it. Thanks so much for your time doctor. mrcash",
