    "question": "Due to excessive alcohol consumption,\u00a0\u00a0I have been hospitalized with pancreatitis 3 times. They were all very severe attacks. I've been sober since the last hospitalization, over a year ago.\u00a0\u00a0I have constant pain in my back and under my rib cage, where my pancreas is located. My doctor says it should eventually stop hurting but it doesn't seem to be improving.\u00a0\u00a0My gallbladder has been removed, my blood work is normal and scans of my pancreas show nothing. Does anyone know what it could be?.",
