            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Often these symptoms may reflect emotional/psychiatric problems related to stress (what is called somatization disorder). The latter is a true medical condition whereby instead of a patient experiencing depression or anxiety, they experience physical symptoms, and once the stress is addressed, the symptoms resolve. Fibromyalagia is another medical condition that leads to whole body pains, and is best treated with medications such as lyrica and neurontin, exercise, and physical therapy.You have many different symptoms. It is difficult to say there is one cause without further evaluations at this time. You should continue working with your physician. Have you had a complete workup including labs (e.g., a 2hour oral glucose tolerance test, TSH, vitamin B12, ANA, ESR and CRP, lipid panel, and routine CBC and CMP?)Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "I am 33.\u00a0\u00a0I've been tested for diabetes repeatedly, no diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Random things happen.\u00a0\u00a0They sometimes last for days and sometimes just minutes.\u00a0\u00a0I can't find the cause of it - other than perhaps heat or sunlight.\u00a0\u00a0Sunlight hurts my eyes.\u00a0\u00a0It gives me a headache within 20 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0When it's hot my whole body, but particularly my legs get VERY heavy.\u00a0\u00a0As if I'm walking through water.\u00a0\u00a0It gets better as I cool off, sometimes it takes a couple of hours to feel 'normal' again.\u00a0\u00a0I've had an MRI with and without contrast (brain).\u00a0\u00a0There was one spot, but was determined inconsequential.\u00a0\u00a0I had another test for my muscles.\u00a0\u00a0They stuck a needle into my skin and had me tense my muscles.\u00a0\u00a0No problems there.\u00a0\u00a0I will list some of the symptoms I get, but I want to be clear - these are not present all the time.\u00a0\u00a0They just seem to pop up randomly and go away randomly.My fingers and toes (usually just one at a time and only the tips) get tingly/numbMy arms and legs from the elbow and knee down get really weak and achyMy joints and muscles feel like someone is poking them with a knitting needle from the insideI get little 'tickly' patches here and there.\u00a0\u00a0Like a bug is crawling on me, but there is no bug.I pee when I cough.\u00a0\u00a0(How embarrassing!)I get a metallic taste in my mouthWhen I eat it seems to go straight through me.\u00a0\u00a0(within 30 minutes)Lymph node has been swollen for 8 years, behind left ear.\u00a0\u00a0(Dr. said if it hasn't grown not to worry)My heels hurt when I walkIt hurts when I sit down.\u00a0\u00a0It feels like I am sitting upon a poleMy arms get so weak I can barely even pump gas (it takes two hands)My vision goes out.\u00a0\u00a0All I see is black and white 'static'\u00a0\u00a0(this happens much less frequently)\u00a0\u00a0Usually lasts 30 minutes - 2 hours and it's fine again.\u00a0\u00a0No headache associated with it.There is more, but I can't keep it within the character limit.\u00a0\u00a0Is there a specific test I should ask for or something I should mention to him as another avenue to pursue?Thank you",
