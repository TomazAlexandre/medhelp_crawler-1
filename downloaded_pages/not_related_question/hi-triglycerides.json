            "answer": "Hi,I am afraid I do not have an actual number to give you regarding your chances of devloping pancreatitis before your triglycerides come down to normal. That TG level is very, very high and you are definitely at an increased risk. In addition to taking the prescribed medication, you should be on a low fat diet and meet with a nutritionist. I also strongly recommend you meet with an Endocrinologist for management and for evaluation/testing as this high level is often associated with\u00a0\u00a0a genetic cause.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to alert your doctors at the first sign of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite because pancreatitis can be very dangerous and early management is important.take care.",

            "answer": "Thank you for replying. I really wasn't looking for a number but more of a general idea. All I can find is the fact that very high Triglyceride levels CAN cause Pancreatitis but never in combination with words like rarely, often, very often, etc..I'm fairly sure that my condition is genetic as my father once had a Triglyceride reading of over 7,000. I'm now taking Gemfibrozil and Lipitor. Are there other treatments for genetic causes?",

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and my blood work showed a very high Triglycerides level of over 5,000. I was told that this could lead to Pancreatitis. I am on two medications and a diet to lower the Triglycerides. My question is, what are the chances that I will develop Pancreatitis before I can get the Triglycerides under control?",
