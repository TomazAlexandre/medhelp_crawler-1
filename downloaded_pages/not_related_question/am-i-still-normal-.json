            "answer": "HI,Your A1C is within the normal range, but the fact that your glucose was over 200 during your IGT means to me that you have some abnormalities in our glucose handling.\u00a0\u00a0I was confused by the way your IGT results were written(because you have 3 values for 30 minutes).I think that given your test results and the fact that you are\u00a0\u00a0overweight, you should start on some lifestyle modifications now instead of continually retesting. Speak with your doctor about starting an exercise program as well as one for weight loss. Then after a good effort perhaps you can be rechecked in about 6 months.Good luck and take care.",

            "answer": "My understanding is that HgA1C tells you what your glu has been for the last few months, so you need not check it very often. The 2 hr glu tolerance test (GTT) will be abnormal up to 2 years before an abnormal HgA1C, so the HgA1C is NOT a good screening test for diabetes. Please ask the lab how to prepare for these tests. Sounds like you may not be doing them right.Treating your anxiety will definately help your ability to do the lifestyle modifications that Dr. Ramsetty recommended. The usual anti depressant medications (SSRI & SNRI) are the treatments of choice for anxiety. They also seem to help glu regulation. In anxiety, you must start at low doses & go up relatively slowly. Certainly your quality of life should improve & your physical health should improve as well with proper medication. God bless & work hard @ what Dr. Ramsetty says!",
