            "answer": "Hello,Without examination,confirming a diagnosis is tough but various possibilities are there for your symptoms. Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol?Such senastions are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Common disorders causing such sensations are compression of nerves,motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",
