            "answer": "Hi,The only way to know if you have diabetes is to test for it.Symptoms tend to develop very slowly in Type 2.At your age, with normal weight, type 2 is very unlikely.Floaters are normal.\u00a0\u00a0They are not a sign of diabetic retinopathy.\u00a0\u00a0Retinopathy typically would occur after many years with uncontrolled diabetes.Type 1 typically develops quickly.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms would be severe.Most likely your test results will be totally normal.Please come back and let us know.",

            "answer": "Hi,your weight is normal for your height.Macula Edema is also not common.The most likely cause of blurred vision is needing glasses, which is not uncommon at your age, and which you have already got.Try not to worry about these rare conditions.\u00a0\u00a0They typically do not occur so readily.Focus instead on eating a healthy diet (plenty of fresh and unprocessed foods), getting regular exercise, and study / work, and social life.\u00a0\u00a0If you are having ongoing problems with anxiety, it may be recommended to talk to someone you trust about this so you can be reassured, or guided in the right direction.Hope this helps.",

    "question": "Facts abt me:- currently 21yo- had been operated in 2014 for a tumor in my left ear.. Since then my left eye has been sensitive to smoke and wind but didnt remember it getting blurryHi all, last May i had a recurring infection on my outer lips... Very small itchy blisters keep coming back, so i got tested and was told it was fungal. It still came back after the medicine doc gave me for it. Then around the same time my eyes started getting really itchy and red, then i realised i have blurred vision, more like nearsighted, but didnt worry about it much since my work involves using computer all day and i thought it was normal.. But a week ago as i was looking at the sky i noticed a floater in my left eye.. Thats when i suspected i have diabetes. Went to an eye specialist and told her my concerns but she just prescribed glasses for me though didnt test me or anything.. Also experience thirst and freq. urination but from what i remember i have always been that way. I am getting tested tomorrow but i am really worried and want opinion of people with diabetes.1. Do i have diabetes? And if so, can i develop diabetes symptoms just a few months after having it in my body? I have been living unhealthily these past months and under extreme stress due to work2. Does it mean i have diabetic retinopathy? Does it happen abruptly? And if so, is there a way to slow progression or cure it or am i on my way to blindness?Thank you to those who will answe this.. I havent slept well and cried everynight bcoz of this ..",
