            "answer": "I'm not confident that treating you with medication will be the right solution for you.\u00a0\u00a0Most medications used for treating obesity are only recommended for a year or so, and most tend to lose their effect once discontinued (i.e. you gain the weight back).The connection between your hunger and your shortness of breath may be the root of the problem - I think that this is possibly a good place to start with your doctor and try to understand it better.\u00a0\u00a0It may be that even performing diagnostic testing during these episodes (pulmonary function testing for example) could be helpful.\u00a0\u00a0Take care.",

            "answer": "I was told that a preventer inhaler can take up to several weeks before it becomes effective.To me, a lay person, it sounds as though emotional stress may be triggering the shortness of breath.Another possibility is undiagnosed heart burn or reflux.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know the exact mechanism behind it but it too can cause shortness of breath.Weight gain and stress can both make reflux worse and affect ones breathing.A better solution would be to get to the bottom of the problem and then solve (treat or manage that).JFood can neutralize stomach acid so perhaps that is why your breathing is worse when you don't eat.",

Due to my lack of exercise I'm getting fatlike a pig with whole symptoms of insulin resistance among others, not to mention the deterioationof lung function. I now am categorised as obese and I'm dead if I don't start dropping at once.One more thing, I'm extremely hungry and whenever I don't eat for a while it triggers my shortnessof breath even though I have no hypoglycemia. Now I need medicines to stop hunger. What doyou recommend?",
