            "answer": "It is hard to say for sure what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0It is good to know that you do not have blockages.I assume they looked into the abnormal heart rhythm you had after the stress test and determined that it was not dangerous.If you have structurally normal heart on echocardiogram (ultrasound), that would be encouraging.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes we never know why people develop a left bundle branch block.\u00a0\u00a0Typically if I see a left bundle and the heart is structurally normal,\u00a0\u00a0I would continue to follow over time to make sure the heart function stays normal.\u00a0\u00a0It is tough to trouble shoot the shortness of breath without seeing the studies.\u00a0\u00a0Checking a blood BNP level ( brain natrietic peptide) helps determine if the cause of shortness of breath is cardiac related.I hope this helps, thanks for posting.http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/483543#Post Comment",

            "answer": "HI:Id like to share my experience with LBBB. I have had heart skips every once and a while. Then last Nov.i decided to have a basic stress test. There was no symtoms other than heart skips and I have no factors for heart disease. During the stress test My EKG went crazy and I experienced shortness of breath but no pain. Another stress test and echo was done all came back normal other than the EKG going crazy. I was told that I had LBBB. I was sent to an electrocardiologist and was told that it is correctable in most cases. I had a cardiac ablation done and it was found that I had a dual AV node. The second AV node was was zapped and was told that I am 100%. I was told the lay off caffiene and take magnesium supplements. I had heart skips up to about\u00a0\u00a02 months. Then skips went away and I dont get short of breath when I am working hard.Hope this helps some.Joe",

    "question": "In Oct of 2004 I went into the hospital emergency because I was having palpatations every third beat. They were seen on the monitor and on the EKG. They told me they were no big deal, sent me home adn told me to contact my doctor the next day. I had a horrible night and the palpatations didn't stop. I went in to see my regular doctor and he put me on Atenolol. That seemed to work and I have been on it ever since. This was at a particularly stressful time as my husband had cancer and passed away a month later.In 2005 I went to see a different doctor for something else totally unrelated and she asked me if anyone had ever said anything about me having a heart murmur. I had never heard that before, but she said she could hear it.In 2006 I was told I have high blood pressure and was put on lisinopril/hctz.In 2007 I was having a lot shortness of breath. I had a stress test and my heart went into an abnormal rythym and I passed out. I was told I had LBBB and I had an angiogram. The angiogram turned out clear.I still get the shortness of breath and I am tired a LOT. Everyone seems to discount this and says I'm fine.I am 52 yr old female, I have diabetes and GERD. I am 20 lbs overweight but I do 30 minutes of cardio every day. During my workout I get palpatations and sometimes pain and then slow down and it goes away.Is this something I should get looked at further?? What do you think is going on??Thank you so much,Julie",
