            "answer": "There are different types of nerve fibers that deal with pain and sensation to the limbs.\u00a0\u00a0To simplify it, think of it as large and small fibers.\u00a0\u00a0EMG can only check the large fibers whereas more specialized testing is needed to check the integrity of the small fibers. Autonomic testing which is done in special labs typically at academic centers (ours is run by Dr. Robert Shields, a neuromuscular specialist here at the clinic) evaluates the small fibers by looking at things like your ability to sweat.\u00a0\u00a0If the tests come back positive, then this confirms the presence of a small fiber peripheral neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't tell you the cause, which unfortunately is unknown in about half the cases that we see despite extensive laboratory testing. SYmptomatic treatment is the same for small and large fiber neuropathies including neurontin, elavil, and other pain meds (assuming that the underlying cause is never found).As for lab testing for peripheral neuropathy, I'm sure your doc has checked for B12, diabetes, thyroid, electrolyte abnormalities.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, serum and urine protein electrophoresis is routinely checked to look for immune mediated causes.\u00a0\u00a0ALso, autoimmune/inflammatory markers such as ANA and sed rate are other things we check.You what feel what you feel and even though neurologic testing has not shown anything, it doesn't mean you're not experiencing the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0It just means that the testing that is currently available can't pick it up or it's non-neurological in nature. Good luck.",

            "answer": "Where do people go for help when their condition cannot be diagnosed and there are no explanations for their pain, numbness, stiffness and other debilitating symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the medical tests do not show any abnormalities for several years and the medical community dismisses them for being \"nutcases\" or imagining their problems.If most people had a choice of being well again or to accept a life racked with pain, mobility problems, stiffness, numbness, etc.\u00a0\u00a0then how many would chose to be in that category.\u00a0\u00a0Prescribing antidepressants or labelling these patients as being psychotic, only increases their stress and adds to the burden they are afflicted with.\u00a0\u00a0Only when you lose your quality of life, do people actually realize what a disabled person goes through.How do you measure or identify pain, who can tell where the numbness and stiffness begins or ends?\u00a0\u00a0Just because the tests show normal, it seems that most doctors tend to dismiss their symptoms and tack it up to anxiety or stress. When the patient can't receive a diagnosis, they are in \"limbo\" as far as eligible for insurance benefits and also lose out on treatments that may benefit their conditions.The ordinary person does not have the financial means available to run from doctor to doctor or invest in alternative therapies. They usually end up feeling very helpless and watch their bodies get weaker and end up losing control over their lives. Friends usually drift away, marriages break up and people stay away.If people have a diagnosis like cancer or a recognized illness, person tend to relate to them more.\u00a0\u00a0If you fall and break your leg or in an accident you may suffer lots of pain, but eventually you will heal.\u00a0\u00a0For those who are trapped in bodies with ongoing chronic pain and don't have an explanation for it, it is much worse.\u00a0\u00a0They lose faith that there will be a healing and that their condition will improve.Some people are in their prime of life when they are struck down with these disorders.\u00a0\u00a0It is a long time to suffer in silence realizing that most people think you are crazy and there are no support groups available to help out. I guess people really don't understand unless they walk in the other person's shoes.\u00a0\u00a0My heart goes out to all those afflicted with pain, numbness etc. and I hope that there will be progress made in understanding what these people go through.The Canadian",

If that's the case, I recommend either Dr. Bernard Wilcosky, a pain doctor at Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City, or Dr. N. John Anegawa, a neurologist in Palo Alto.Both will take you seriously (Wilcosky has personal experience with chronic pain). Anegawa is more aggressive with drugs, while Wilcosky is slow and systematic. Both are happy to answer questions.I agree with the frustration of hearing that a test was negative and therefore we are \"fine.\" What a screwed-up system if we find ourselves actually hoping for positive results!",

            "answer": "This is for the many posters on this board who report variations of peripheral neuropathy and MS-like symptoms, especially the many who are frustrated that conventional medical testing and workups have left you without solutions, or even diagnoses.In people who report sensory and/or motor disturbances, tingling, numbness, and other unusual sensations in BOTH upper and lower extremities, and/or the face, the cause is most likely not a localized lesion, nerve root entrapment, or other focal problem. These types of complaints smack of a systemic problem, one attacking the body's entire nervous system and possibly the cardiovascular system as well. Environmental exposures, namely chemicals should be suspected, especially when there is a history of such exposures.For at least some of you folks with these types of symptoms, I would strongly suggest you ask yourself whether you consume aspartame in your food. I would bet that many of you use diet products, especially \"sugar-free\" lines of products containing the now ubiquitous aspartame artificial sweetener (sold as \"Equal\" and \"Nutrasweet\"). The two amino acids making up 90 percent of aspartame are neurotoxins/excitotoxins in large enough doses, which themselves can cause problems with the nervous system. But the most harmful constituent of aspartame may be the 10 percent of the product that binds the two amino acids together -- methanol (wood alcohol). That substance breaks down in the body into first formaldehyde (used in embalming) and then formic acid (the poison in ant stings).Methanol is a powerful neurotoxin, one that may slowly be pickling your nervous system. The damage may be permanent, but you can at least halt the progression of methanol poisoning by halting your intake of the poison. There are, on the other hand, many instances of people having improvement in their symptoms upon eliminating aspartame from their diets.I certainly understand anyone being skeptical that aspartame is the cause of their problems, but there is an easy way to prove this suggestion wrong. Simply eliminate ALL aspartame from your diet for 60 days, and see if your symptoms improve. If you need artificial sweeteners in your life, there are at least four or five others that are available.Many of you have expressed great frustration at the inability of the medical profession to even identify the cause of your problems, let alone treat your illnesses. What do you have to lose by trying my suggestion?",

            "answer": "I would like to suggest that a \"slight\" bulge between (L4/L5) verterbrae can definitely cause sciatica, and if it is severe enough, peripheral neuropathy can develop.I was diagnosed with Diabetic Polyneuropathy in 2001. Problem is the initial disc herniation was in 1983, with several repeated injuries leading to a sciatic nerve spasm in 1989 that last 8 days. My doctors at the time and my chiro agreed that something serious had happened but didn't really know what it was. I went through a series of tests between 1995-98 but the results were generally inconclusive. Luckily, my doctor believed me. But that 8-day spasm created the pain associated with PN and in those days I went through sensations of intense cold (entire leg) and then packed my leg in ice because of intense heat. Eventually, most of the leg healed, leaving a badly nerve-damaged foot and ankle. By 1997, I found a name for my disorder shortly after my left leg began to pain me as the right had 8 years earlier.In 1994 I was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome, which I thought was a bit off as I'd only had my PC two years. My research indicated that the baby finger is not nourished by the carpal nerve and it tingled along with the rest of them. In 2001 the specialists confirmed that I had peripheral neuropathies (stocking - both hands) over carpal tunnel syndrome.Somehow, when I finally had a full battery of tests at the (newly opened) Diabetic Neuropathy Research Centre in Toronto (2001), the doctors informed me that there was no doubt. I had Diabetic Polyneuropathy! I challenged their findings but was assured it was confirmed by the experts. What was I to do? At least I could get treatment and after 2 years I've managed to reduce the pain levels to an acceptable level. I was told that people can be glucose resistant for 10 years before they are diagnosed. I accept that but my spasm occured 12 years earlier and I have had many blood tests in the intervening years as I gained weight and edema resulted. Glucose levels was standard in most of those tests. My blood glucose measured 14 when I diagnosed and I keep it simmering between 5.5 and 6.9 (sorry I don't know the US equivants) most days now.I am looking into other causes for the ongoing PN discomfort and associated problems, but I know exactly when (Mar 19, 1989)and why I got neuropathy pain(By which time I had very little disc left and had a pinched sciatic nerve diagnosed 2001.)There are many causes of PN. I agree with others who have posted that you are your own best medical researcher. There are a lot of terms to learn and contradicting opinions.I wish you all the best,Lynne",
