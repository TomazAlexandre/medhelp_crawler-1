            "answer": "Hello,Thanks for posting your query.High specific gravity and ketones are present in dehydration (drinking less amount of fluid, diarrhea, vomiting, excessive sweating) and starvation. Drink plenty of water (at least 8 glasses) and eat healthy food. But you also need to get your blood sugar levels checked as high specific gravity and ketones can be found in glycosuria.Glycosuria is the excretion of glucose into the urine. It is caused by elevated blood glucose levels, most commonly due to untreated diabetes mellitus.In nondiabetic persons, ketonuria may occur during acute illness or severe stress. If you have been in the convalescent phase of any acute illness then it can also cause raised ketones and high specific gravity.Hope that this information helps and hope that you will get better soon.Wishing you good health.",
