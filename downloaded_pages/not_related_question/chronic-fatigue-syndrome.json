            "answer": "There appears to be a genetic susceptibility component to CFS (and many other chronic diseases) that may or may not be related to immune system genetics.\u00a0\u00a0So, yes, it is possible that susceptibility to CFS may be an inherited trait.\u00a0\u00a0That does not necessarity mean that offspring will necessarily develop CFS.In addition, there are some indications from the literature that CFS and similar illnesses can be transmitted from parent to child.\u00a0\u00a0We found this in military patients that transmitted their illness to their spouses and children.\u00a0\u00a0In that case we were able to identify a very specific airborne bacterial pathogen that was being passed to offspring and other immediate family members.The most obvious symptom of CFS is chronic fatigue (not corrected by sleep or rest), but this usually goes along with additional symptoms, such as joint and/or muscle pain and soreness, central nervous system problems (memory loss, brain fog, cognative problems, headaches, etc.), bowel problems (irritable bowel, diarrhea, etc.), sleep difficulties, vision and hearing problems, etc.",

            "answer": "That could depend on what type of diabetes you have.\u00a0\u00a0If you have an immune-type diabetes (type 1 diabetes), then this can be certainly linked to other autoimmune diseases.\u00a0\u00a0If you have type 2 diabetes, the relationship is less established.Often diabetes patients have many other problems, so it is not out of the question to ask about a potential link.\u00a0\u00a0However, I am not sure about the linkage of type 2 diabetes to autoimmune diseases.\u00a0\u00a0I will have to check on this myself.Prof. Nicolson",

    "question": "Hello, my Mother was diagnosed when she was in her late 20's with CFS. I was just wondering if this syndrome is one that can be inherited from generation to generation (her-me-my child ect)? And if so, what is the major or top 3 symptoms I should be aware of? I have been extremely exhausted for the last year and getting worse. Not sure if this is from my anxiety/sleep disorder or possible CFS? Thanks",
