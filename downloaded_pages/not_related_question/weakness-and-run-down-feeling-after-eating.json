            "answer": "To determine if the symptoms are blood sugar related, you can test your sugar before and after meals.\u00a0\u00a0There should be no random blood sugar above 200 - or else diabetes would be a concern.\u00a0\u00a0With your sugar reading of 85, this would be a less likely possibility.Other considerations would be GERD, ulcers, gastroparesis, pancreatic or gall bladder disease.\u00a0\u00a0Test to evaluate these disorders would be an upper GI series/upper endoscopy, abdominal ultrasound or tests for the pancreas, including pancreatic enzymes.Gastroparesis can be evaluated with a gastric emtpying scan. A 24-hr pH study can also be considered if the diagnosis of GERD is in question.\u00a0\u00a0These tests can be discussed with your personal physician.Depending on what and how many vitamins you are taking, it is possible that they may be causing your symptoms.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

            "answer": "I will mention everything to my doctor when I see him. I also worry about hypoglycemia because I seem to fit the symptoms of someone who is reactive hypoglycemic since I get the weakness an hour or so after eating and feel anxious and shaky most of the time. When I was a child, I remember fainting in the yard and I was suspected for being hypoglycemic back then. Perhaps my recent low carb/lower calorie diet has aggravated the condition.Any advice or suggestions will be appreciated. Thanks.",

    "question": "I have an weird problem that I hope you can help me with. About 30 minutes to 1 hour after eating, I sometimes get this really weak feeling in the middle of my chest which is followed or accompanied by a run down feeling which I call the blahs. It's very similar to the feeling one gets after sitting too long in a hot bath but it seems to be centered in the middle of my chest. I feel weak, tired, and groggy in my head and sometimes even short of breath when it happens. The only thing I can do then is lay down and wait until the sensation passes or exercise since exercising seems to drive the feeling away most of the time. Do you have any idea what is going on here? Could this be blood sugar related? I have seen a cardiologist and pulmonologist and everything was fine with both heart and lungs. I have taken GERD meds but the sensation remained so I don't think it has anything to do with reflux. I'm really baffled.I might point out that I do take supplements with every meal and I've been wondering if taking too many vitamins can cause this feeling? If so, why does exercise make it go away.One last point, I am eating healthy and watching my sugar and carb intake to avoid blood sugar spikes. I'm dieting to lose weight but the sensations were there before I started dieting. Thank you for your help.",
