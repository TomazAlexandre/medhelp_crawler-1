            "answer": "Hi,The first thing you should probably do if the odor issue continues is have your daughter examined by her pediatrician(to make sure there is no infection etc) and tested formally.\u00a0\u00a0This is the only way to know with certainty if she is having problems with sugar metabolism. In the meantime it is a good idea to cut back on the sugary drinks anyway.Take care",

            "answer": "Hello,Her doctor would have done blood tests for high blood sugar problems. There are some specific tests that can be done for particular sugar metabolism issues but you will need to discuss this with her pediatrician as it isn't quite my specialty(I am more an adult Endocrinologist and may tests are quite different for kids).Take care.",

            "answer": "Respected Doc,I would like to ask you about my father. He is 66 years old, he has Diabetes mellitus tip 2 almost 23 years and he is taking insulin since then. This September he had Infarctus myocardii parietis diaphragmalis NSTEMI (hart attach), and 2 CVI. Multiischaemio celebri.(strokes) and he suffer from Hypertensio arterialis. This is written in the relief document from the hospital.He takes medicine regularly and insulin twice a day 14 IJ (morning)- 12 IJ (evening) and test regularly the level of blood sugar, but two days ago he told me that his blood sugar was 17,4.??? On 11/13 he has appointment to do the Computer Tomography and after that he has appointment with Pulmologist - breast Doc and Cardiologist.My question will be: Do I have to take him to the hospital to visit Endocrinologist or Neurologist or first to finish with Cardiologist? and your opinion about do this results have anything to do with his hart or brain? I'm scared about his health and I would not like to see him with another stroke or hart attach never again.I hope you will understand my English and if you have any other question about his diagnoses please let me know.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much! LinaG",

            "answer": "Hello,Thank you for writing on behalf of your father.Diabetes definitely has efects on the heart as well as being linked to strokes, so in your Dad's case this is likely all related. In addition to close follow up with his cardiologist in future, you should be in close contact with his endocrinologist especially if glucose values are running high. So I do urge you to contact his Endo as soon as possible to get his sugars optimized and hopefully decrease future chances of other serious heart and stroke related events.Take care",

    "question": "I have a\u00a0\u00a02 1/2 year old that has been having a very smelly vagina. I tried everything from diet, meat, soap, milk, and anything others had suggested. I was wondering is it possible that sugar could (drinks, cereal, candy) be causing her to have a odor down there. I took her off of kool aid and hic and just put her on cran-grape and milk to drink and it seems to have taken away the odor. She does not say her \"thingy\" hurts anymore. Can someone shed some light on how sugar breaks down and could she possibly be having problems breaking down the sugar in her body?",
