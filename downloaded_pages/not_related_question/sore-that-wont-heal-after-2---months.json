            "answer": "Thnks for asking this question. I am 62 and have same problem. I think mine started out as some sort of bites. Have on shoulder upper chest and a blistering one on upper thigh.\u00a0\u00a0Upper thigh one went away. But other ones almost heal and then blow up again. Oh also had one in my ear. I had been on trip to las vegas when they started to appear. Think it might be bugs in hotel bedding. Still waiting for some to heal. Has been over a year.",

    "question": "My baby is almost 18 months old.\u00a0\u00a0Over the summer she seemed to get a few (what I initially thought to be) bug bites on her head (her temples mostly).\u00a0\u00a0These \"bites\" looked a bit like nasty mosquito bites but they took an awful long time to heal.\u00a0\u00a0One would finally heal and another would pop up.\u00a0\u00a0After about six or seven \"bites\" I started to worry that they were not bites at all.\u00a0\u00a0They would get red and swollen and eventually a bit scabby but never really seemed to bother her.\u00a0\u00a0Now in late June of this summer I noticed a small bump on her right shin.\u00a0\u00a0This small bump then turned into what looked like a larger blister.\u00a0\u00a0The blister seemed to erupt and it has since gotten quite red and inflamed and it now has a scab on it and it just is not getting any better.\u00a0\u00a0Now I'm thinking of things like diabetes, flesh-eating disease or some sort of immune deficiency or something worse like cancer (I don't know if this would have any bearing on the subject but both my parents died from the disease, although neither had skin cancer).\u00a0\u00a0The one thing that also comes to mind is the fact that I have genital herpes.\u00a0\u00a0From 36 weeks in my pregnancy onwards (she was born at almost 42 weeks) I took Avirax to help ensure I would not have an outbreak prior to delivery.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think that I had any lesions when I delivered her but I am of the understanding that a person can be asymtomatic and still be able to pass along the virus.\u00a0\u00a0Right now her sore is red and swollen (slightly small than a dime I would say) and there is a scab in the centre.\u00a0\u00a0It is just not healing and I'm very concerned.\u00a0\u00a0I do have an appointment for her to see a skin specialist but that is some time from now and I am hopeful that you could shed some light on this in the interim.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you in advance for your input.",
