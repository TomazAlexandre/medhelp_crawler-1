            "answer": "Well, I'm 63 and\u00a0\u00a0thought how can this be happening to me? Thought it was only old people who had cataracts. HaHa. Any way, left eye was fixed a week ago with a Tecnis acrylic aspheric. Couldn't tell its not my normal eye of 40 years ago, except that now the focus is fixed at about 13-14 inches. No problema, cause I've worn specs for 43 years and the multifocals work just fine. Actually I still find it hard to believe how easy, painless, and effective the surgery and lens implant has been. Good luck.",

    "question": "Are cataracts normal in all individuals? I'm 43 yrs old I woke up one morning and had cloudy, foggy vision in my left eye. My optometrist has of 12 years has never informed me I had cataracts. He says cataracts are as normal as wrinkles. I guess for someone older. My opthomalogist says it's rare to have this kind of cataract at my age. 2 % of the population. I've worn glasses for nearsightedness for 20 years. 2 yrs ago I had timponaplasty and extosis surgery. I have had tinnitus for years. I'm wondering what other things could cause this overnite. I had no eye trauma or exposure to toxic substances. I'm not diabetic.",
