            "answer": "Hi,Assuming that you have diabetes, I am afraid this is a common problem with individuals having this disease--especially if glucoses are not well controlled. Injuries to the skin do take longer to heal and are more likely to become infected. If you also have sweling in your legs this in addition causes some weakness in the intergrity of the skin.Diuretics should help the swelling. If your current one is not working, speak to your doctor about alternatives. Also, discuss if you need to be on a low salt and/or fluid restricted diet.Having your legs up when possible is also of great help in keeping the swelling down.Hope this helps.Take care.",

    "question": "I don't heal well at all, some mosquito bites I got took 10 months to quit itching and heal up. I always have bruises that I can't identify the cause of. Now my legs are bruising from my socks. I try to find loose topped socks, but any constriction at all causes my ankles to swell, and causes pain and bruising. I take a diauretic. What else can I do to help this problem? Thank you for any help you can give me.",
