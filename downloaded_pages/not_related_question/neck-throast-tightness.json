A major symptom of stress is a tightness in the throat/difficulty swallowing or a feeling of a lump in the throat. Also maybe you should have your thyroid checked?Wish you the best of luck!",

    "question": "I am a 52 year old female, not overweight, do not smoke. Father died of diabetes/heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0Since before Christmas I have been experiencing\u00a0\u00a0a very uncomfortable tightness on the left side of my neck, deep within, that sometimes migrates to the center of my throat, also deep within.\u00a0\u00a0The last 3 days I have developed \"heartburn\" and indigestion, something I've never had except during pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0These 2 symtoms are of concern to me.\u00a0\u00a0I currently have Parvovirus, which was found in bloodwork. My primary care wants me to go for allergy tests because I haven't been feeling well, and had a hard time fighting bronchitis during the fall (alsom uncharacteristic.).\u00a0\u00a0Should I pursue\u00a0\u00a0a cardiologist visit?\u00a0\u00a0I have this concern of \"jumping the gun\" and self-diagnosing, but on the other hand, if these are heart symptoms.... Thank you.",
