            "answer": "You don't mention exercise, an important ingredient in BS control.Who designed your diet?\u00a0\u00a0You should be enrolled in a diabetes class to learn about recommended diet for diabetics as well as portion control.\u00a0\u00a0I've found that eating small portions every couple of hours or so allows the body's insulin to be released in small amounts.\u00a0\u00a0Huge meals tend to release too much insulin that is not efficiently used by the body.\u00a0\u00a0(This is a layman's explanation and may not be scientifically accurate but is a clumsy attempt to simplify what may be happening.)Lastly, are you on any other meds, say for high blood pressure and/or cholesterol?\u00a0\u00a0They have a tendency to raise BS - although not as high as 500+!!Good luck!",

            "answer": "Hi,with blood sugar of 558, you could possibly be type 1 rather than type 2.You need to go back to your doctor and ask for thorough testing to determine your type of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0This will include testing of insulin levels, c-peptide and also antibodies.It is possible to be type 1 even if you are an adult and even if you are not slim.Do you have family history of type 1 or type 2?With blood sugar as high as you describe you may need to be given insulin, even if you are indeed type 2.Please monitor closely.\u00a0\u00a0Please also eat low carb.\u00a0\u00a0This will mean a better breakfast will be eggs and some veges, rather than eggs and wheat bread. Daily exercise will also help lower blood sugar.If your sugars are not coming down you need to go back to your dr.\u00a0\u00a0Please do be aggressive in getting proper treatment as this is critical for your long term health and survival.",

            "answer": "Hello,with blood sugar that high you could be type 1, instead of type 2.Given what you say you are eating (mostly very low carb - except for the wheat toast), I think you should go back to your Dr and ask for testing for type 1.This testing will include C-peptide, insulin levels, as well as antibodies.The proper treatment for type 1 is insulin.\u00a0\u00a0The proper treatment for type 2, if you can't get your sugars down to normal levels with oral meds is insulin.It is very important that you get tested because type 1 can occur in adults (regardless of age), and even if you are not slim.Low carb diet and exercise will help. But if your pancreas is not working it will not be enough.Do you have any family history of type 1 or type 2?\u00a0\u00a0Have you had any previous testing of blood sugar in the past?\u00a0\u00a0If so, when and what was the result.Looking forward to your response.\u00a0\u00a0Please be aggressive in treating this well as your long term health and well being is depending on this.",

            "answer": "Carbs turn into sugar after digested...aka bread...i agree you need to take a course or google a diet on controlling your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0What about beverages?\u00a0\u00a0Fruit is usually considered healthy but is just a natural form of sugar...so is juice.\u00a0\u00a0Ive read recently about the herb fenugreek stabilizing blood sugar...but be careful because may cause unsafe drops...talk to your doctor..alot of people use it as a spice...but according to Dr. Oz you need a TBS. a day...and theories are out as to whether it causes weight gain or loss.\u00a0\u00a0Also, you simply may not be on enough insulin or the right medicine.. Your doctor does not want to over prescribe initially and place you in a comma...go back...keep a log of your diet, times eating and times sugar level taken....it will help your doctor see you are seriously sticking to your plan and help him/her decide the best form/brand of insulin for yo.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes.",

I'm taking 1000 mg of Metformin every twelve hours but I can't get my sugar below\u00a0\u00a0250 mg/dl. I've been eating two boil eggs and one slice of wheat bread with butter for breakfast and chicken salads with no dressing for lunch and dinner yet I can't get my bs below 250 mg/dl.
