            "answer": "Sandy,Third Molars:\u00a0\u00a0Evidence Based Rationale for TreatmentThe American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons and the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Foundation are completing the seventh year of the landmark \"Third Molar Clinical Trials\".The researchers have discovered that for patients ages 20 to 35 enrolled in a longitudinal clinical trial, retained third molars, even those that are asymptomatic and show no signs of disease, may pose serious health risks that include chronic oral inflammation from periodontal disease which also increases the risk for elevated inflammation throughout the body.The data from these studies are unique in that periodontal disease effects \"young adults\" ages 20 to 35.\u00a0\u00a0If untreated, the periodontal bacteria will encompass second molars and other teeth.In 20 to 35 year old pregnant women, third molar periodontal disease increased the risk of delivering a low birth-weight infant and pre term birth. 6\u00a0\u00a0For these patients, the periodontal inflammation in the third molar area poses a danger akin to smoking during pregnancy.A growing body of evidence suggests that untreated periodontal disease provides a portal into the bloodstream for pathogenic bacteria.\u00a0\u00a0Oral bacteria has been linked to more serious health problems, including coronary artery disease, stroke, renal vascular disease, diabetes and obstetric complications. Young adults also appear to be at risk, particularly from periodontal pathology affective third molars.The AAOMS Third Molar Clinical Trail suggests that most thirds molars, even those that are asymptomatic and show no current signs of disease, are at risk for chronic oral infectious disease, periodontal pathology and tooth decay, and should be considered for removal in young adulthood.Studies looking at third molar surgery show that increasing age is a risk factor for complications.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, removal of third molars should be considered before the patients' 25th birthday.Periodontal pathology in the third molar region is difficult to treat successfully.\u00a0\u00a0Even with repetitive treatments, eliminating the pathogenic bacteria may not be possible.Retained third molars pose other health risks for affected patients, and may lead to the loss of adjacent teeth, or the development of cysts or tumors in the jaws.\u00a0\u00a0After their removal, reconstructive surgery of the area may be required to repair, reconstruct and restore jaw function and facial form.\u00a0\u00a0As an Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon, I have seen many cases in which the patients condition could have been prevented if the third molars were addressed earlier in life.ConclusionsScience has finally caught up with the long held belief that young patients should be critically evaluated for the removal of their third molars.\u00a0\u00a0This includes a good quality extraoral radiograph (Panorex), intraoral examination, complete medical history and a thorough discussion of the risks, benefits and alternatives to removal vs. maintenance of the teeth.It is my sincere hope in communicating this information, that you will seek the advice of an Oral and Maxillofacial.\u00a0\u00a0Not every patient referred to me for wisdom tooth evaluation requires surgery; however, every patient should be aware of their condition.Information contained within this reply is intended solely for general educational purposes and is not intended nor implied to be a medical diagnosis or treatment recommendation.\u00a0\u00a0This is not a substitute for professional medical advice relative to your specific medical condition or question.
