    "question": "I feel nauseated and feel like i need to vomit almost all day. My stomach tends to ache. I have PCOS and i am currently going to the Fertility Clinic. My doctor put me on Metaformin, but i dont have any type of Diabetes. He told me it was to lower my insulen. I have looked it up and seen the Side effects it can give, but i have been on this medication now for about three months, taking up to three pills a day. It hasnt done anything but give me diarhea all day. I also havent gotten my period for three years. The doctor gave me pills to make my body give me a period, and it did work. I guess my main question is, because of that one period, could i be pregnant?",
