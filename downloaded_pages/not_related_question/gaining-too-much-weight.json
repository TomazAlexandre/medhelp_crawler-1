I've read you're not supposed to gain in the first trimester, but honestly, don't stress yourself out. Try to get a little movement in and eat well balanced meals- this was hard for me since carbs were pretty much the only thing that settled my stomach in the first trimester. You will be ok :-)",

I think most women are aware in this age group what we eat will ultimately help our future child so you seem very ignorant in assuming we don't.\u00a0\u00a0Also some people may have issues they need to address without judgement, some have thyroid and weight issues as well, so stop and think before you talk about many factors you know nothing about. You may have an issue one day with yourself or baby and I hope someone is helping not judging you like you do to others!",

You can give yourself diabetes.With my first I gained about 60lbs. And it was awfulI was the same as you. Couldn't stop eating. I put so much risk on me and my baby.This pregnancy I started it about 15lbs overweight, and am currently 15wks. Instead of gaining I've been losing like crazy due to morning sickness. But I have also been portioning out my food. Staying away from pastas, breads etc.Think of your baby! You don't have to exercise, you don't have to eat salad all day, just PORTION PORTION PORTION!!!",

            "answer": "10 pounds in 13 weeks doesn't seem high to me. Basically, if you stay at this rate, you'll gain 30 pounds during your pregnancy. That seems healthy. I am 16 weeks and have gained 9 pounds. I bring fresh fruit with my everywhere. Grapes, cherries-- things I can just keep popping into my mouth.",

            "answer": "I asked my sister about it too and she said it all evens out because I had been thinking about your comment and my own weight gain. She lost 10lbs in her first trimester but still gained 30lbs with her last baby... She said her doc said the same thing, it all evens out. I gained 6 pounds pretty quickly but have stayed there at my last couple appointments without too drastically changing my diet... Although I was eating bagels loaded with cream cheese pretty much every morning because it was the only thing that helped my stomach and I cut that out. I started eating more fruits and veg but kept everything else he same. I think it will work out and your doctor will let you know if there is a concern. Thanks for asking this question, I think many women experience the same or worry about this too!",

            "answer": "Don't worry, it will sort itself with you probably not gaining next trimester. Try snack on fruit,salads and yoghurt maybe?I was lucky in my last pregnancy to only gain 10lb but the next year lol I gained what I didn't in pregnancy. Now I started this one 20lb past my happy stage so I'm following as much as possible a healthy diet so I don't gain much. The hospital will do the diabetes test at around 16to 22 weeks, I can't remember and if you gain drastic up till then you will be at risk but in matter of fact we are all at risk anyway so it's really just another worry throughout pregnancy we all deal with. Don't look negative at food because baby needs it so just make wise choices. Last pregnancy I wanted to crunch on food so I lived on melon for the first half.....second half I loved meat so I just cooked it healthy. Last few weeks I ate crap and I had a 7.6 baby boy. It's pregnancy, we get to be piggish and enjoy it lol so just try it in moderation. Don't let weight worry ruin your pregnancy, enjoy every minute of it hunnie x",

Dr told me to take anti nauseous medication but I don't want to take anything I can't tough out. I've read and also had friends tell me the nausea will go away after 1st trimester so I'm hoping for that and I can slow down on the eating. Let's just enjoy this pregnancy and we can always lose it later! ;).",
