In his words, he can't tell me what it is, but he can tell me what it isn't. Since the swelling and bleeding has gotten worse in the last 3 weeks, he is sending me to a retinal specialist. The area he seems to be heading is perhaps this is a result of my blood pressure dropping and then spiking. He also couldn't tell me what was causing the floaters, or if they were connected to the other issue. He is the best optho in this area,\u00a0\u00a0but I'm beginning to worry that they will never find out what the deal is and that i may begin to loose my sight.",

Although I now know what is wrong, it seems that despite some of the best docs in NC, we still can't find a cause. The doc is requesting all my med records and MRI's but so far doesn't want to say it may be caused from my other illnesses.What causes this usually, and am I at risk for loosing my sight in the future?\u00a0\u00a0What are the chances this will happen again?
