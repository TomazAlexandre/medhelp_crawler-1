            "answer": "Dear erikanikole85,It is hard to give you an accurate diagnosis over the Internet without meeting you in person but\u00a0\u00a0I can give you some helpful pointers.You are extremely young for developing a serious heart condition. In addition, you do not describe any significant risk factors that is history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, family history of premature heart disease.With an absence of\u00a0\u00a0any risk factors and your age, it is very unlikely that you suffer from a heart condition.chest pain or chest discomfort can arise due to multiple conditions like lung related problems or food pipe related problems or musculoskeletal issues.Reading the description of your symptoms, I suspect that the latter two are the\u00a0\u00a0likely culprits in your case.Regardless, if you continue to feel unwell, I suggest that you seek medical attention from your primary care doctor.hope that helpsCCFHeartMD19",
