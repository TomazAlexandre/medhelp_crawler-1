            "answer": "Hi,When was your\u00a0\u00a0friend diagnosed with brain cancer?Is she a close friend?When you say you had lots of panic attacks before, what were the circumstances that\u00a0\u00a0surround your panic attacks?Are you anxious over lots of things lately?Any problems in school or family?Anxiety or constant worrying may lead to hyperventilation ( deep rapid breathing ) that may lead to dizziness.Depression may also lead to insomia and irritability .I suggest you see your school's psychologist or guidance counsellor to discuss your friend's death and other situations that may cause you unnecessary anxiety.Manage to focus on your studies, go out with friends and enjoy time with your family.All the best to you and keep us posted for anything!",

            "answer": "Hi,I understand this may be frustrating in your part.Before a diagnosis of brain cancer is to be considered, more common causes like ear infections, cardiac disease, anemia, low blood pressure and peripheral nerve involvement be considered.An assessment by a neurologist may help rule out any of these possible causes and may also help allay your fears.I wish you are feeling better now.Have you discussed with anyone issues that seem to depress you? I recommend that you do. I also suggest you try deep breathing exercises, aromatherapy and soothing music to keep you more relaxed. Yoga and tai chi may also be fun to do with family and friends.Keep us posted for anything.All the best.",

    "question": "Ok I am 15 years old turning 16 this month , for about 6 years now I have been having alot of panic attacks but for the past 2 months I have felt something different. I feel tired and lightheaded most of the day and just feel sick to the stomach.\u00a0\u00a0I've been looking alot into brain cancer because of the symptoms one of my friends had that recently died was the same as mine. One factor it could be is that I'm not eating well because I only have 1 meal a day . Another is that I'm not really active I weigh 180 pounds and I'm 5'8 .\u00a0\u00a0Another could be stress or not wearing glasses ,but I'm not sure. Im have bad anxiety so I have not went to the doctors because of that I just wanna see what it could possibly be . If anyone knows what this could be than please tell me.Symptoms:DizzyLight HeadedBlurry VisionFatigueCan't SleepSick to the stomachIrritableTrouble catching breathThere is no cancer in my family but there is diabetes.Please contact me at ***@****",
