            "answer": "Thank you for the reply. I checked all the symptoms for an STD the conditions I have doesn't resemble any of it. I am going to get an appointment with the Dr. soon.I don't see anything abnormal(in my penis) today\u00a0\u00a0except the small cuts (which seems to be healing) I just looks normal like any other time. I still have the cuts in my lip corner which is getting better but I am applying some vaseline on it.I have a family history of diabetes ,do you think that has something to with this.I\u00a0\u00a0learned that yeast/fungal infection can occur when blood sugar not normal?",

    "question": "Hi,About 5 months ago. I had a white rash on my penis foreskin(uncircumcised) and I get small cuts which doesn't hurt until i touch them or when i sweat.All this time i have had that dry scally skin shows up some days and it goes away when i clean it with water(even when I wasnt sexually active).I had then non stop for months but just dry skin. But last time had sex with a girl was like about 3 weeks ago.Last week I got the white flaky skin.But now the dry skins is all gone but i have 2 cuts. At the same time I got this cut an dry skin in my lips corner(only right side). The skin had dried out but still I can see the cut in the edge.When i got the rash first time I looked it up i learned that It could be yeast infection so I took the home remedies . But now this thing scares me since I have it in my lips corner and in my penis skin(particularly where the skin is wrinkled).Does herpes/any other STD? I didn't have blisters or fluid filled sores.It was the skin cut and blood clogged out of it.Thank you,",
