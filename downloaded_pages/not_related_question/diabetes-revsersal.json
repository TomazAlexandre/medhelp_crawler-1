            "answer": "Hi,I think some of the problem is in terminology and not necessarily the mechanics of the diagnosis. For example, heart disease: once you have that diagnosis, you always have it even after a stent, or even bypass.\u00a0\u00a0Some people think of diabetes this way. I am of the other camp: I do not always label people with diabetes if they now have normal blood sugars when off all medications. That does not fit the diagnostic guideline. What I do say is that there is a HISTORY of diabetes, and this is important to include because even if blood sugars become normal again, you will be at higher risk than normal for going back towards high glucoses in the future.Hope this answers your question.take care.",

    "question": "Hello Dr Ramsetty,On the User Diabetes Forum there seems to be a debate whether diabetes Type II can or cannot be reversed. I was led to believe that it could be by proper diet and moderate exercise, especially if one is a borderline diabetic. The other camp says no way, once diagnosed as a diabetic always a diabetic. Is this also being debated within the medical community as yes and no camps?Your opinion please.Thank you.",
