            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to obtain a history and examine you, I can not tell you what your diagnosis is, or what is causing your symptoms.Hand numbness could be a manifestation of different conditions, one of them being a neuropathy (problem in the peripheral nerves).\u00a0\u00a0A neuropathy usually causes sensory problems (such as numbness or pain), in the distribution of a specific nerve, or symmetrically affecting both sides, (commonly have been described as a \u201cglove\u201d distribution if affects the hands, or \u201cstocking\u201d distribution if affect the feet).Neuropathy could also produce weakness, and the distribution is as mentioned above, and the symptoms could be a combination of sensory problems, motor problems, or both.There are different types of neuropathy, and common conditions include diabetes, nutritional or vitamin deficiencies, inflammatory conditions, metabolic conditions and infectious problems. Initial work up include a detailed history and examination, to consider if it meets the distribution and characteristics of a neuropathy. If in fact this is one of the considerations, work up includes blood tests to rule out diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, inflammatory and systemic conditions, infectious process, and other rarer conditions.It seems that you have had some work up for some of the conditions that could be involved, and they have been ruled out.Electromyography and nerve conduction studies are also performed, and this gives an idea if the problem is affecting the nerve itself, the sheaths or both, also can give some information about the cause and prognosis.Regarding \u201ctwitching\u201d, it is difficult to correlate it to a specific condition, and this depends on what the movement is that the patient calls \u201ctwitching\u201d, as there are movement abnormalities that have larger or smaller amplitude, and higher or slower frequency, as well as distribution. Most commonly what people call \u201ctwitching\u201d could be attributed to medications or drugs, caffeine or other components ingested. It could be present in anxiety as well. Other conditions could be associated with \u201ctwitching\u201d such as movement disorders like tics, or dyskinesias. Nerve problems could cause abnormal movement in the muscles themselves, and people could refer to them as \u201ctwitches\u201d, and the work up is as discussed above. However the movements would be only restricted to the area affected by the nerve, and not widespread.More widespread \u201ctwitching\u201d in the muscles could be fasciculations, and in the right setting with an association with other neurologic manifestations, could be attributed to illness such as motor neuron disorders or muscle disorders. And this should be evaluated by a neurologist.I think it is important for you to be evaluated by a neurologist, to find the cause of your problems, and determine if your symptoms are caused by a neurologic problem or not. Other work up like and EMG and NCV should be considered if there is a possibility of a neuropathy.Unfortunately with the information you provide, and without being able to take a detailed history and examine you, I cannot give you a diagnosis.I hope the information provided helps.",

            "answer": "I wake up unable to feel or move the last 2 fingers on my right hand. It is the knid of numbness you get with a \"dead leg\" when you've sat funny. I hold my hand in front of my face and will my fingers to move. Eventually, the feeling returns and I can move my fingers. I used to wake up with both my hands \"crooked\", like you'd seein an old lady with artheritis. Any suggestions about what it is? Any similar experiences?",
