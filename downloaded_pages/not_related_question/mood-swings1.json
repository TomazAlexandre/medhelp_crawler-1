            "answer": "HI,Mood swings can be from many reasons, most not at all related to insulin or its use. If you are suspicious it is related to the lantus, the only reasons that come to mind would be from either having glucose levels that are too high or too low, and the unlikely(but still possible chance that you are allergic to Lantus. If your blood sugars are relatively stable I would suggest looking into other causes for the mood swings.",
