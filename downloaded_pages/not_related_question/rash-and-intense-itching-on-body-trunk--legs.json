            "answer": "now im not a un-knowledgeable person, but i do not know much about being diagnosed w/ diabetes.kinda scary the more i think of it with all my other health probs...it all started when i woke early one morning feeling very sick to my tummy.. oh,and my mouth was veryyyy dry. (which isnt that abnormal when u first wake in the morning) so i thought nothing of it till it kept getting dryer and dryer while i sat in the bathroom rocking back and forth trying not to puke!lawd i hate puking lol... . 20 mins praying to god i WOULD NOT PUKE LOL... finally i started feeling a little better(or so i thought). all of a sudden my mouth went from dryer then a desert, to for some my mouth was filling up FASTTTTTTT w/ this nasty metallic metal tasting saliva. i had to literally spit about 10 times or my mouth wuld have over flown with this spit... i dont know how to explain how my mouth filled up.. it was like filling a glass of water with the faucet on full force!!!!!! and man, the taste was so nasty... well,to say the least even after spitting all this out,it didnt matter how many times i spit it out it kept filling right back up and FAST! because of the taste etc the feeling better went away and i was on the floor throwing up so hard and pretty violent.. after about 10 mins of being sick my tummy felt better,i wasnt AS dizzy,and my mouth stopped filling up for that moment being.yes,diabetes does run in the family quite a bit..and yes i eat too much sugar at times...but i seem to get sick alot now lately and im not use to that being alottttt... (besides other health issues i have) ive tried looking this up and alls ive read was pregnancy (WHICH IM NOT LOL) , gastro and the main one was diabetes...can someone give me some input about this??havent gone to dr yet but i dont like going there much...thanks lots...",

    "question": "I have a very bad rash that started with pin point blistering. Very itchy now spread all over body.\u00a0\u00a0I have recently been changed over from Dilantin to Tegretol for seizures and ever since I have had this rash.\u00a0\u00a0Going on 2 months. I have been very irritable and short of breath having to use my nebulizer to compensate. Doctor has been moving and I have not been able to see her. I researched on internet and found that I have some of the symptoms but not all of the symptoms for this drug change.\u00a0\u00a0At the same time I was researching I found that Tegretol and Diltiazem are not really compatible.\u00a0\u00a0So I don't know what is really going on.\u00a0\u00a0Saw my family doctor yesterday and she prescribed Prednisone 40 mg.\u00a0\u00a0I still feel that I should have appt. with Neurologist who put me on Tegretol and saw me in the beginning. I feel I have been brushed off. Prednisone is a real battle when dealing with sugar levels.",
