            "answer": "Dear mark670,Your eosinophil level is near normal, hence there is nothing much to be concerned about. The levels can rise a bit because of any recent infection such as sinus infection or cold or an allergy.Constant tiredness and fatigue could be due to several causes such as anemia, hypothyroidism, chronic fatigue syndrome, disorders of the hypothalamus, psychiatric disorders such as depression and sleep-related breathing disorders. At your age, your blood sugar levels also need to be evaluated as diabetes can often present with tiredness as initial symptom.I would suggest that you get your hemoglobin levels checked. A low hemoglobin can make you feel very easily tired.In case your Hemoglobin is low, you can have iron rich foods like liver, lean red meats, beans like kidney, lima, navy, black, pinto, soy beans, and lentils, iron fortified whole grains, green vegetables like spinach, tofu, broccoli, swiss chard, asparagus, parsley, chicken, nuts, egg yolk and dry fruits. You can also have iron supplements along with these foods after consulting your physician.Hope that this information helps and hope that you will get better soon.Thank you for using MedHelp's \"Ask an Expert\" Service, where we feature some of world's renowned medical experts in their fields.
