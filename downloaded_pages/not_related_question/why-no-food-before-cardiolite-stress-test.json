    "question": "I have been instructed not to consume caffeine 24 hours prior to my cardiolite stress test, and to fast the morning of the test.I understand that caffeine affects the heart, and so will avoid caffeine even though it means a headache.It is very difficult for me to fast. Although I am healthy, I am used to eating something every 2-3 hours. When I do not, I feel lightheaded and weak and miserable, and cannot imagine getting on a treadmill. Breakfast would not interfere with hard exercise (I always eat breakfast before my morning workout). Is there a medical reason to avoid food, or is it just for comfort while exercising?",
