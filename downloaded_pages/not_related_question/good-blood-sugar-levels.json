            "answer": "Hi Pael.Your average number of 115 is reasonable, though it is slightly higher than would be considered non-diabetic. If you can keep your numbers around this level or slightly better is great.\u00a0\u00a0Keep working with your dr as well.For reference non-diabetic numbers are in the following ranges:-1. Fasting and before eating:\u00a0\u00a070 - 95 (in the 80s is considered perfect).2. Post eating (2 hours or when blood sugar peaks): 90 - 140, but ideally < 120).To reduce blood sugars you can do the following:-1. Eat lower carb foods (this will mean avoiding sugar and sweetened foods, less grains, sweets, fruits, and eating more veges).\u00a0\u00a0IF you eat less carbs then you will need to eat a bit more protein and healthy fats.\u00a0\u00a0 If you want to look up diet approaches; then this would be paleo or Mediterranean (with less carbs though) approach.2. Daily exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Brisk walking is ideal.3. Lose weight if overweight4. Ask your Dr about metformin / glucophage.\u00a0\u00a0This drug is an insulin sensitizer.\u00a0\u00a0It is very helpful for many with type 2 diabetes.",

            "answer": "To be in the safe you need to be <=100 fasting, 80-120 normal waking, <140 after meals. Every time you go over 140 you are doing damage. Your doctor might say 160 or something is OK, but I've read health websites abroad and elsewhere most would say keep 140 or lower. 115 average is high since that number includes your fasts/wakeup and meals. You actually need to track the fasting and meal averages separate (get a phone diabetes app that will do this). That average is great if it's 2 hrs after meals, terrible if that is your wakeup. That's why the meter averages are terribly unhelpful. You should go to the doctor and get a a1c and a fully battery of tests so they can test your body functions to make sure you aren't receiving any organ damage from having a constantly high sugar like that.",

            "answer": "Here is some more information on blood glucose ranges and blood sugar testing for you from MedHelp.org and the Sugar Sense app.http://www.medhelp.org/diabetes/articles/Be-Blood-Sugar-Savvy/1777If you enter enough data over enough days, our app gives you an average A1C -- this is your 3 month average amount of glucose in your blood. It's likely a better measure than the daily averages from your meter, as Mindmaster points out. Here's a little more about the A1C:http://www.medhelp.org/diabetes/articles/All-About-the-A1C/1766Here is a link to download the app, you'll have to copy and paste it into your browser: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.medhelp.sugarsense&hl=en",
