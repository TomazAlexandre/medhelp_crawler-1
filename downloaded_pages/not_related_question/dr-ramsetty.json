            "answer": "Hi,From what I recall and have read, Lyrica is often prescribed twice or even three times daily for diabetic neuropathy. The max dose in people with normal kidney function is 600mg/day. I think you can take the 150mg at one time if your doctor suggested this, you have normal kidney function, and it is squared with your pharmacist just to be sure. And you can also speak to your doc about higher doses to help your neuropathy. I also suggest requesting a referral to a diabetes educator/nutritionist as they are the very best regarding dietary information(and are truly invaluable).Hope this helps,take care.",

            "answer": "I just fornd this forum Judy.\u00a0\u00a0I wrote with you on the fibro forum.\u00a0\u00a0I did not know our numbers before from your blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0You are in the lower diabetic range.\u00a0\u00a0My glucose count was 397 and my A1c ( which by the way is the average of your blood glucose over the past 3 months) was 11.9.\u00a0\u00a012 is the top of the range.\u00a0\u00a0I was in pretty bad shape.\u00a0\u00a0Your numbers are good compared to where I was.\u00a0\u00a0I was givien different meds.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor agrees with me on your next course of self help.\u00a0\u00a0Call your insurance and see if they cover diabetic nurtition instruction.\u00a0\u00a0Mine did and I just paid the copay for 6 classes.\u00a0\u00a0It was one of the best investments in my life.\u00a0\u00a0If they don't pay make it a present to yourself.\u00a0\u00a0It is well worth the money spent.\u00a0\u00a0You will learn what to eat to conteol your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0You are low enough that you may be able to contol it by diet and no diabetes meds.\u00a0\u00a0As I said in the other forum I take lyrica for fibromyalgia.\u00a0\u00a0It has given me such relief.\u00a0\u00a0I started on 125mg one in am and one in PM.\u00a0\u00a0This was to strong and ifelt stoned all the time. Endocrinologist game me samples of 75mg one am and one pm and they are workning much better in the stoned department.\u00a0\u00a0I still have great relief from the pain and I will tkae them for the month to see where I stand.\u00a0\u00a0My nurapathy which was intermittent seems to be gone.\u00a0\u00a0Since it would come and go I can't say for sure it is gone.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to call your doctor if you are not having any luck with the Lyrica to see if an adjusment needs to be made.\u00a0\u00a0Since you are diabetic you usually get a closer monitoring of your condition adn quick responsed to questions since our condition is progressive.\u00a0\u00a0I found a good Endocrinologist to monitor my diabetes since that is their speciality.\u00a0\u00a0I just didn't think my GP was educated in the diabetes feild enough to carefully monitor my condition.\u00a0\u00a0Even if you can't walk for exercise you can do leg lifts from a chair and arm exercises too.\u00a0\u00a0Or do them on the bed.\u00a0\u00a0The more you do them the stronger you will get and maybe work up to walking again.\u00a0\u00a0If you feel you can walk just go a short distance and back.\u00a0\u00a0If you do OK with that go a little farther the next day.\u00a0\u00a0Even two feet farther is good.\u00a0\u00a0Baby steps lead up to giant steps.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and trust in youself.Joyce",
