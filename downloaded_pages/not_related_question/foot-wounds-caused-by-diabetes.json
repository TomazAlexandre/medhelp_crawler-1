            "answer": "Hi,I am afraid I am not familiar with Manuka Honey, so I cannot comment on it, or the ability to help heal diabetic wounds.I am sorry about this development\u00a0\u00a0for your\u00a0\u00a0grandmother, this is indeed a serious development. While you are seeking alternative treatments, also keep in mind that diabetic wounds do often require\u00a0\u00a0fairly aggressive treatments to avoid spread of the infection(which can then become much more serious). I suggest perhaps seeking out a second opinion from another vascular surgeon regarding the need for amputation, but consider it seriously because too much delay may make your gandmother's condition worsen. I am sorry I could not be of more help regarding alternative medication treatments for this situation.Best of luck and take care.",
