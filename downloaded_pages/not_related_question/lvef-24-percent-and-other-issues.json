            "answer": "I don't know your situation, and this may not be relevant, but *everyone* should know that hospice services are available for heart patients. I had always thought of them in the context of cancer and did not use them when I was taking care of my father until 8 days before he died of heart disease. Things would have been much easier if I had brought them in as soon as he was eligible.",

            "answer": "Adding to what Charlotte 116 said, Hospice was the best thing that ever happened in the case of my dying mother. They can be engaged six months (or more) before a person might die. And the care and availability 24 hours a day was phenomenal. Every nurse or staff member who came out was like a loving angel from God--anxious to help and give support in every way--medical, emotional, spiritual, etc. I encourage you or anybody to seek the help of Hospice as early as possible, when it is needed. God bless you.",
