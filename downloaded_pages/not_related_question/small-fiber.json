            "answer": "Dear Larry:You ask a very good question, but perhaps too broad to answer on this forum.\u00a0\u00a0I will try and condense this.\u00a0\u00a0Various nerves are found in different diameters.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know why nature did it this way, but it just is.\u00a0\u00a0The smaller ones are involved in pain and temperature sensation where as motor function, position sense, vibration sensen are larger nerves.\u00a0\u00a0Touch is mediated by both kinds.\u00a0\u00a0EMG studies do not measure small diameter nerves only those of medium and large diameter.\u00a0\u00a0There arev very select etiologies of small fiber neuropathies, amyloid, diabetes, hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies, Fabry's disease, and Tangiers disease.\u00a0\u00a0There is in addition, an idiopathetic type which we do not know the etiology of.\u00a0\u00a0Except for the latter, the only way to treat is to treat the underlying illness.\u00a0\u00a0Left untreated, the small fibers or nerves will die.\u00a0\u00a0This causes complete numbness or lack of function depending on the neuron.\u00a0\u00a0I hope I have helped you alittle.CCF Neuro MD",

            "answer": "I have been told that a skin biopsy is the only test that will\u00a0\u00a0tell you if you have this disease. I have been diagnosed with this disease and I want to have this test but \"Johs Hopkins\" is the only place that I have been told that does this test that is close to were I live. This is a skin biospy not a nerve biopsy some people get them confused. This was told to me by my neuro Dr. I hope this answere one of your question and will be checking back with hopes of more info.",

If I have a skins biopsy will it tell me more of what is going on with this disease? Why is my neurogist thinking mine is hereditary because I had hammer toes and had them operated on as a teenager? Is he thinking it is CMT because every time I call hereditary up on the computer I see this disease.",
