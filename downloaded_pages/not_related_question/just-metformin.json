            "answer": "HiYes some people manage with just metformin and diet. However, and you say you're average blood sugar is about 170. This is double the normal non diabetic level. You may need to greet low carb diet and exercise as well as metformin. If this doesn't work them it may be worth considering other meds.",

            "answer": "I have def reduced the amount of carbs intake and I just don't eat alot of garbage I was eating pre-diagnosis like blowing pizza and junk food to me. I take metformin 500mg twice a day.\u00a0\u00a0I got a little off track during the holidays and really had to focus on getting back on track.\u00a0\u00a0I've noticed a moderate level of cardio helps me keepMy sugar levels down for example this last weekend I went out and got really wasted, a friend was in town and I over did it. Normally I don't drink at all anymore as we all no alcohol is full of sugar and extremely bad for you. So I had been averaging in the 116 area for the last month with 1 high of 132. I was proud of that but anyway after getting drunk I knew I was gonna be REALLY HIGH. I didn't even bother taking a reading Sunday while I was nursing a hangover so today I took my first reading as expected extremely high of 199. I walked/jogged enough to build up a sweat and got it down to 109 on my next reading approx 4 hours later.\u00a0\u00a0So yah 100 point drop basically for 20 minutes of moderate cardio and my normal medication routine. But everyone's different so take it how you will",

            "answer": "Remember, T2 diabetes is a progressive disease. If you continue to need Metformin, eventually you will need to add another med. I took metformin 500mg twice a day, then 1000mg twice a day, then added glipizide 5mg twice a day, then glipizide 10mg twice a day, now have added Levemir injectable at night. This all occurred since 2003.",

            "answer": "Had to start taking glimiperide. Was really scared of bs dropping low and having seizures. Dr. assured me that wouldn't happen as long as o had a routine schedule. Now avg is 75-109 fasting. Tried to do it without extra meds but had to give in. When I wasn't trying, a1c was beyond 12. When trying with just met and right foods, I got a1c down to 9 but that wasn't low enough for doc. I feel better tho after taking glimiperide. Thanks for ur comments",
