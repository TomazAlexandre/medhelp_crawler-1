            "answer": "To answer your questions:1) There are no studies suggesting clear causes for a low gallbladder function .\u00a0\u00a0In many cases, no definitive etiology is found.2) It is unlikely a lower gallbladder ejection fraction would lead to diabetes.3) Changes in stool shape or caliber should be further evaluated by a colonoscopy.4) I continue to suggest a colonoscopy to exclude colon cancer.5) Excluding diabetes itself should be a priority.\u00a0\u00a0Obtaining a fasting blood sugar would help exclude this.6) There are small studies suggesting some benefit to removing the gallbladder in patients with a low ejection fraction.\u00a0\u00a0However, there is no guarantee that the symptoms would resolve.7) Imaging the spine can be done to exclude a herniated disk or mass effect.\u00a0\u00a0An MRI would be a reasonable start.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patients education only.

    "question": "Hi, I am a 35yr old male, non-smoker and non-drinker for the most of my life.For the last 5 years, every 6~9 month I would experience pre-diabetic symptoms, such as frequent thirst, wake-up at night and urinate often.\u00a0\u00a0I also breakout a sweat during a fatty greasy meal, but no abdominal pain.The last attack from this March is especially worse.\u00a0\u00a0I have lost 10 lbs since. (I am 5'9 and now weight 167).10 years ago, when I had an occasional drinking binge,\u00a0\u00a0I left the alcohol in my stomach overnight.\u00a0\u00a0Previously it takes a lot of drinking to even get me buzzed, but since then a beer or two is enough for me.I also had possible gallbladder attacks 10 years ago! Blame Vegas buffet for that!I was found to have H. Pylori bacteria and went though the triple-antibiotics treatment 2 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I also hadI also recently had ultrasound done, and detected no gallstones.Sorry about the rambling, I am trying to put in as much info in as little space as possible.My recent HIDA scan, however, discovered my gb ejection rate at only 7%.My questions are:1. what could have been the causes for my gallbladder not function, since I don't have gallstone under ultrasound?2. are the diabetic symptoms caused by the gallbladder, or some other more serious disease?3. recently my stool has been very small and narrow, is this a cause of concern?4. I am losing weight at a rate of 1lbs every 2~3 days recently, what should I do?5. what can I do to ease the diabetic symptoms? I am unable to rest well at night and feel cranky & fatigued.6. should I have my gallbladder removed asap, or diagnose for other diseases first before surgery?7. I don't experience abdominal pain, but I feel my spine hurting from time to time.\u00a0\u00a0What could this be and is this a cause of concern?Thank you so much for your time and I appreciate your answers greatly!-Alan",
