    "question": "In early December 2005, I was potentially exposed to HIV.\u00a0\u00a0I had receptive unprotected vaginal sex 3-4 times and briefly was penetrated anally, once and only for a few minutes.\u00a0\u00a0NONE of these instances included ejaculation, and just a few days short of the 10 week mark, I was tested with a rapid HIV test.\u00a0\u00a0I was negative for HIV and syphilis.\u00a0\u00a0About a week and half prior to the test, I came down with a fever, mild body ache and a runny nose.\u00a0\u00a0It only lasted 4-5 days and many other people I knew had similar symptoms (peak of cold/flu season), so it caused me little worry.\u00a0\u00a0However, the person whom I engaged in these acts with told me that just under 4 years ago, he slept with a girl who was known to be HIV infected.\u00a0\u00a0He confirmed this because, according to him, she called him up over two years later and asked for a ride, which turned out to be to pick up meds for her HIV.\u00a0\u00a0Soon after this, he was put in jail for some parole violation and was offered a HIV screening.\u00a0\u00a0He told me that the doctor told him that he'd only hear back from the med staff if something turned up on the test, but if he wanted to test again, to do it once more in six months.\u00a0\u00a0This sounded odd to me, but he said no one contacted him, so he once again took another test in six months. No word back.\u00a0\u00a0When I was tested, I asked the lady giving me the test if that was common procedure in a jail and she said it was very common for it to be administered that way due to the large amount of tests being given.\u00a0\u00a0The man I was with was confident that he was free of STDs and seemed confused with my upset nature after learning all of this AFTER all had been done.I do apologize for rambling on so long, but there is one more odd detail to my story.\u00a0\u00a0My mother, who has had failing health due to uncontrolled diabetes, many surgeries for tumors, hernias and years of morbid obesity... was recently diagnosed with Hepatitis C.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors think she probably got it a long while ago and it was just dormant.\u00a0\u00a0When I was born, she had a C-section.\u00a0\u00a0I've been told and read that this can greatly reduce the risk of Hep C being given to a baby, while the chance itself remains low at 1-10% (the risk being further reduced if mother is HIV-).\u00a0\u00a0When I was little, I remember getting poked by a diabetes lancet of my mother's, though I don't ever remember a used one drawing blood from me.\u00a0\u00a0If anything, it just barely poked my skin.\u00a0\u00a0This also is supposedly somewhat difficult to contract hep C from (0-7% chance in healthcare workers, or so I've read) if it's a one time occurence.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, (so sorry for the length) I wanted to know what you think the chances are of my HIV test results being somehow delayed or incorrect due to a possible hep c infection.\u00a0\u00a0If I did in fact have hep c, is there a strong chance that it could delay the seroconversion of HIV?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much.",
