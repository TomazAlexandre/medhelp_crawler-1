            "answer": "Without looking at the scans I can not deny or confirm what your neurologist told you. A few \"white spots\" in the brain can be seen in patients with high blood pressure, diabetes, and migraines. Non-specific white spots can also be seen in MS and other inflammatory disorders, but typically have a different appearance. Depending on how the scan looks, following it up in a 6-12 months may be reasonable. Also, checking for markers of inflammation, and conditions that predispose to clotting, such as anti-cardiolipin antibody syndrome, may also be usefull. However, without looking at the scans I can not recommend a course of action. If you are concerned you could discuss this with your neurologist. Good luck",

    "question": "A neurologist told me i have brain lesions from having so many migraines (10-12 per month)after doing an MRI of my brain.(She did the MRI because I have numbness and tingling in my hands, feet and face)--I also have Fibromyalgia. she said not to worry about them unless i smoke. but i am concerned. I already take 100 mg. Topamax to try to prevent the migraines, along with 500 mg magnesium, malic acid and a low dose B complex vitamin. Do I need to be concerned about the lesions, and what about second hand smoke?I have read that they can be early signs of MS and also lead to stroke in young women (I am 47). Her diagnosis of the numbness was that it must be from my fibro---the carpal test and nerve conduction test came back negative.",
