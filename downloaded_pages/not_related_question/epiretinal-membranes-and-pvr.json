            "answer": "PVR = proliferative vitreo-retinopathy. Usually caused by retina not getting enough blood and abnormal blood vessels develop that cause scarring and bleeing into the eye. Most common cause is diabetes. ERM is membrane developing on the surface of the retina, generally not a problem unless its over the macula.\u00a0\u00a0they are different problems PVR can lead to blindness but ERM can't.JCH MD",
