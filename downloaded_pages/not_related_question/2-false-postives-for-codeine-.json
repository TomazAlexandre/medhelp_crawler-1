            "answer": "I ate bagels and drank coffee with evaporated milk as a creamer and the same thing happened to me. You have to ask for a &quot;GC-MS test&quot;. That way, they will know if it is real opiates or a false positive. They should do this on all positives, just to make sure, but they don&#x27;t. Poppy seeds and lactate dehydrogenase(evaporated milk) can cause false positives for morphine and codeine. As little as 2 bagels once or 1 bagel every day can cause a false positive for codeine or morphine. Evaporated milk makes things worse by interfering with the metabolites and makes it look like there is more opiate PPM than there really are. Like I said, ask for a Gas Chromatography(GC-used to separate different molecules in a sample) followed by a Mass Apectroscopy (MS-wherein spectrographic patterns are compared to a standard to identify the separated molecule) test, and that will vindicate you if you are telling the truth. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3505132/",
