            "answer": "You're right. The doctors at the hospital didn't seem too concerned with finding out which type I was since my treatment is the same either way for the time being. I, on the other hand, am dying to know which way this domino is going to fall since it will influence the rest of my life. I hope at my follow-up appointment on Thursday, my PCP will do the antibody test or I can get into an endocrinologist asap to have it done.",

            "answer": "Hi, three month ago I almost had these symptoms and was diagnosed with type 2 . Meds made it worse for me so I looked into diets to help\u00a0\u00a0and stumbled upon the ketogenic diet it help me a lot to manage the sugar levels , but sense you do a lot more meds than I did I recommend that your doctor readjust your meds if you are going to do this diet because it really lowers the auger a lot that the meds would be too much , I hope this helps you too .",

            "answer": "Hi, based on presentation with very high blood sugars, but relatively low Hba1c, this would indicate a rapid onset of high blood sugars, suggestive of type 1.Type 1 diabetes is certainly known to be triggered by viral illness.Testing for type of diabetes becomes relevant when it comes to insurance coverage (type 1 tend to get broader coverage than type 2 - unfair as this may seem).When you see an endocrinologist you should be tested for type 1.\u00a0\u00a0This will include antibody panel, testing for c-peptide etc.You may find eating low carb diet will be beneficial to assisting managment.\u00a0\u00a0You will have a steep learning curve ahead, but you can do this.Really good resource books, both avaialble from Amazon, or maybe your local library, are:-Think Like a PancreasDiabetes Solutions",

I just wanted to let you know we have a Type 1 forum here as well, if you end up being diagnosed with Type 1 as some are predicting.

            "answer": "I finally got a blood draw for the antibody test! I should know the results early next week...I am so anxious. I'm in this state of limbo at the moment because the doctors and I just aren't sure what exactly were dealing with. Yeah, we know it's discrete but other than that lol. I'm having to adjust my long-acting insulin (Lantus) almost every night because my fasting morning sugars are still higher than the ideal. I started at 10 units a night when diagnosed and now I'm up to 22 units. Is that a high dosage? It's all so new to me so I don't know if that's a sign of type 1 or 2? I was never put on a short-acting insulin so I just rely on Metformin and Lantus at the moment.It's just so strange, to me, to go from nothing wrong (other than a 'typical' sickness) to being diabetic. My estimated A1C now (based off my blood sugar numbers from this app for the last 2 weeks) is 10.4%. That's quite high, right?Finally, I will see an endocrinologist next week too! More answers hopefully will be coming!",

            "answer": "Hey everyone! It's me again...lol. I actually talked to my endocrinologist nurse practitioner today and she is going with a type 1 diagnosis. My GAD antibody is negative but she thinks it may be too soon for my body to produce antibodies or too soon for them to show up. It's only been about a month since this whole thing started so she believes I haven't started to make antibodies yet. In her lab results, my fasting blood sugar was high but my c-peptide and insulin were normal, which she found alarming since c-peptide and insulin should have been high along with my blood sugar. Based on all my symptoms and labs, she and the doctor above her believe it's type 1. Yesterday, I was a type 2...24 hours later, I'm a type 1 lolI still feel like things are a bit uncertain but I know my doctors and I are going to do what's right for ME, regardless of type. First goal is to get morning sugars normal and go from there!\u00a0\u00a0It's been a long road for my diagnosis and I know the diabetic road is longer still. I got this though! Thanks for all your input and support!!",

    "question": "Hello. First time posting as I've been diagnosed diabetic only 2 weeks ago. I'm a 30 year old woman, in good health with no other known medical issues, until now. I recently found out that I am diabetic but the doctors can't detemine which type. (I know they can do an antibody test but for some reason it was cancelled.)Here were/are my symptoms so I want to get opinions on type 1 or 2...extreme thirst, fever, sluggish and tired, loss of appetite,\u00a0\u00a0keytones in urine, KDA, A1C was 7.9%, low potassium, resting heart rate above 110, extreme vision change and vitamin d deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0Blood sugars were anywhere from 300's to 506 at highest point.I had flu-like sickness with a sinus infection and bronchitis earlier in December. Can a sickness cause diabetes to appear out of nowhere?\u00a0\u00a0This was just something that hit me out of nowhere...other than my parents being\u00a0\u00a0diasgnosed diabetic in their 50's and 60's.I'm on insulin for now and metformin trying to get my sugars under control. I spent a night in hospital trying to get this sorted out. I just want opinions while I wait to get into a specialist. Thanks! :-)",
