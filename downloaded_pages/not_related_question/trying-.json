            "answer": "Hi!Many PCOS patients don't have the usual constellation of symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0A very good friend of mine ( and mother of 3 ) had PCOS and is quite thin and fit--she has a lovely complexion too.If you were my patient, the first thing I would do is to (after checking the pregnancy test which I ALWAYS do ) treat you with 5 days of Prometrium.\u00a0\u00a0This medication should start your period and \"clean out\" your uterus.\u00a0\u00a0Then, I would start you on Metformin and Femara.\u00a0\u00a0For some reason that we don't entirely understand, Metformin reduces the insulin insensitivity that is a part of the PCOS. The Femara would help you to ovulate regularly and speed up the time to conception.I prefer Femara over Clomid because it has fewer side effects and (in my experience) works better.I would also recommend that you continue with your healthy lifestyle!I hope that this is helpful to you!Dr B",

    "question": "Hello! My husband and I are now trying to get pregnant and I have been diagnosed with PCOS. Since I was 13 I have been on BC and I have always had very irregular periods. After my diagnosis my OB put me back on low dose BC but I wasn't having a period so with the consent of my OB I went off BC in April. It has now been 8 months with no period, spotting, cramps, etc. I do have lower abdominal pain like an aching sensation during intercourse and not. I am taking prenatal vitamins now by nature made. I don't have the typical symptoms like diabetes, overweight, hairiness. I don't smoke, I work out regularly, and I eat a balanced organic diet. Please help I feel like I will never get pregnant!",
