            "answer": "Gastroparesis can be difficult to treat.\u00a0\u00a0The initial medications would be something like Reglan or erythromycin.\u00a0\u00a0Also treating any underlying disease leading to the gastroparesis (i.e. diabetes) can help.If these initial steps aren't working, then more invasive options such as surgery, or gastric pacing, can be considered.Experimental therapies can involve botulinum toxin injection into the pylorus.I would consider another GI opinion - preferably at a major academic medical center.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

I am in my third year of college and I miss tons of classes because either I am in too much pain or am vomiting. Sometimes, the vomiting and nausea get so bad that I have to go to an ER near campus and receive phenergran by IV.\u00a0\u00a0That is the only medicine for nausea that I tolerate. I just want to live a somewhat normal life.\u00a0\u00a0I want my doctor to test me for diabetes, thyroid disease, and scleroderma because there is a family history of all three. For my insurance to pay, either the gastroenterologist or my GP would have to order the test. Neither will do so. This is so frustrating and I am tired of being so sick.",
