            "answer": "I think the most important question to ask here is - do you really need to lose weight?\u00a0\u00a0If you eat 800 calories a day (which I don't recommend) to lose weight, it starts to beg the question of whether it is medically appropriate for you to be trying to lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0It would almost suggest that your body is trying to tell you something...what do you think?",

It is very hard to live this way!\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much for helping me with my problem.",

            "answer": "I would say yes, that does indicate there is something wrong with the individual.I was just wondering how many calories a person in a coma would require.\u00a0\u00a0That too would probably require more calories as the body would be using energy to repair itself.My thoughts are that since you're restricting the number of calories you're consuming you're in 'starvation mode' and any extra turns to fat.\u00a0\u00a0Your body's way of protecting itself.You could almost be describing me in some respects.\u00a0\u00a0At the beginning of last year I was eating a very low calorie diet (again) and running (40 -120 minutes) most days.I became physically and mentally burnt out and eventually started to over-eat to compensate for the famine period.\u00a0\u00a0I did gain weight.I think this could be more of a psychological issue than a physical one.Your body is probably shutting down though due to the approach to diet and exercise you've taken.I may be entirely wrong.\u00a0\u00a0Feel free to write back with any comments.J",

            "answer": "That's true for me also regarding having more energy on a low calorie diet (when compared to eating in excess).Are you able to eat a balanced diet with your 800 calories?I almost feel you're leaving out an important piece of information (that would make your situation understandable).\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what that could be or even if you're aware of it.I do understand you're feeling desperate.\u00a0\u00a0I almost feel that in order for you to make some tangible changes you need to relax a little (i.e., give up the calorie counting, etc).\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like you're trying to keep things together by controlling.You may like to try the emotional eating forum (expert forum).\u00a0\u00a0You may get some different advice there altogether.J",
