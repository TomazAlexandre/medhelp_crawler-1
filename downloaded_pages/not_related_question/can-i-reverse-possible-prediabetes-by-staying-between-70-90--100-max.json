    "question": "I am not sure whether or not I have pre diabetes or diabetes already. I cannot afford to see a doctor.I am under the impression that if I stay between70-90, 100 MAX fasting& 80-100 postThat I can solve/reverse this issue.I've been showing signs of having hypoglycemia for the past 2-3 months after I got the DEPO shot.From shakiness & anxietyTo night terrors & sweating in my sleep. I brushed it off because I didn't know any better.It wasn't until Friday the 25th that I had my first hypo 'attack' & found out my sugar drops. It was at 47. I got a meter & for the next week I treated the lows by eating 5-6 small meals (I'm used to 1-2 x's a day). On Friday the 2nd i actually over ate. I had a burger, small fries & oj & woke up in a panic at around 3 am I thought my sugar dropped despite eating what I did. Instead it spiked to 198. I've never been that high. Always between 80-90 100maxAfter that my sugar will not go down. I've been fighting with the high sugar for 3 days now & FINALLY managed to ok it last night & this morning. Last night after 2-3 hour walk, my sugar was at 85 I ate high protein & no carb. I did about an hour of bedtime yoga & 2 hours later I was at 108. I did another 15-20 minutes of yoga & went to bed & this morning I'm at 100. I slept well, no huge spikes. I still don't want to reach 100 because that still makes me feel really sick. My goal is to stay between 70-90 again.I haven't been battling any lows since the 12/2/16 after it spiked to 198.I've stayed in the 104's-171's-my highest since 198.I am trying to adapt the Keto diet because I think it will help.I have a lot of things working against my sugar levelsAnxiety disorderDepressionMedicationsChronic stressInsomnia\u00a0\u00a0etc.I've had all these things since I was a child so nothing new.I just need help understanding what to do about this whole mess.",
