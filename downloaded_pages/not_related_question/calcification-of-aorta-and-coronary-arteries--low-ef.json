            "answer": "If his coronary arteries are all patent, or do not benefit from revascularization, then he will benefit only from medical therapy. Besides the medication syou mentioned, statins such as lipitor are very effective in decreasing the secondary risk of coronary atherosclerosis progression. If he has NYHA class III symptoms such as inability to walk up one flight of stairs before developing shortness of breath then he may also benefit from aldactone or eplerenone. Depending on his EKG he may also benefit from a special 3 lead pacemaker besides the ICD as well.",
