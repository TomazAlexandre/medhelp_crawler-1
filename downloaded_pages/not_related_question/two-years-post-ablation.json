    "question": "Hi Dr Lupo,I had my thyroid ablated a little over two years ago due to hashitoxicosis. I have lost about 4 pounds through this time and my hair is not falling out anymore. The pain and muscle weakness has been pretty constant for three years steady. I am on 200 synthroid since February, I was increased slowly, my last labs were\u00a0\u00a0TSH 2.75 so no dose change. My Endo agrees I will have good and bad days...but is the pain something that is normal with this type of autoimmune? I have hust been checked for systemic collagen vascular disorders the bloodwork came back ok. Also bone scan for oste was ok. I am 45 and peri-menopausal. I have pre-diabetes with type1 antibodies, and tested positive for anti-parietal antibodies, negative for celiac sprue. Could the combination of all the antibodies be causing the pain, or would you think just the thyroid being ablated?",
