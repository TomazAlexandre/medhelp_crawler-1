            "answer": "I also have gestional diabetes. I am fortunate that I do not have any other complications. Make sure you get in with a dietician and monitor your blood sugars. I plan on delivering vaginally, I am 37 1/2 weeks and I will be induced at about 39 weeks. Thankfully they keep measuring my baby to be on the smaller side, so I have that as an option. If your placenta is really low, where it is presenting first, they will not let you deliver vaginally and you will have to have a c-section. You will start having regular ultrasounds with the gestational diabetes anyway so they will continue to monitor the placement of your placenta to determine the best method of delivery.",
