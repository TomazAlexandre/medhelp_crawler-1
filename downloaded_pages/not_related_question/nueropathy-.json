            "answer": "Your case does not sound typical for HIV neuropathy which usually becomes symptomatic later on in the course of the disease. This means that people usually have other manifestations of HIV like infections before they experience neuropathy like symptoms. And the symptoms of neuropathy, (like numbness and tingling) are usually in the lower parts of your legs and arms rather than the upper parts. It sounds like you may have a peripheral neuropathy which can be caused by numerous things such as diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, electrolyte abnormalties etc.., but HIV is certainly NOT at the top or even near the top of the list unless you have risk factors such as multiple sexual partners and needle sharing in IV drug use.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Hi Rusty, sorry to hear about the pretty awful symptoms you are having to put up with.I also have very similar symptoms,along with others such as fatigue, visual disturbances, foggy head and others.What has your doctor given as a possible explanation for your symptoms. Has he done any blood tests, in particular has he checked your vitamin b12 level. I don't know what is causing your symptoms but there is no doubt that a b12 deficiency can cause great damage to the central nervious system if it goes undetected.Ask if he has checked your b12, and don't accept that it is normal without knowing what the actual result is. I know many doctors do not accept that you can have a problem if it is above the lower normal level (about 200pg/ml in the US).If it is anywhere in the 200's ask to have your methylmelonic acid and homocystein levels checked, they often can detect a b12 malabsorbtion problem when the serum b12 level still shows within \"normal levels\" if there is such a thing with b12.It may be nothing to do with your problem but it is definately worth checking out.Best of luckGraham",

My pcp and nuero both believe my symptoms are not the result of any serious illness.My neuro says it is not at all unusual to expierence symptoms of numbness and tingling and be healthy.He also stated that neuropathy can occur without cause in up to 30% of cases.I'm having trouble accepting that i can be healthy and have all these symptoms.",

            "answer": "Rusty, you said your blood tests including b12 were normal, sorry to labour the point but did your doctor tell you what your b12 level was. I know from communicating with several people, who suffered a long time with this problem before being diagnosed, that they were told their levels were normal when in fact they were in that \"grey area\" that some doctors are either sceptical of or unaware of.If your b12 level was way above the 200's (pg/ml) then fair enough but if not don't overlook this, many doctors do. All you have to do is ask.Best of luckGrahamKris, I read your post also, I don't want to sound as if I have a bee in my bonnet (no pun intended) about this subject but again many people with b12 problems , were on acid blockers, like myself, for stomach problems and this can effect the way that b12 is absorbed into the system. If anyone is told they don't have a neurological disease and yet they have neurological symptoms this is an area which is greatly misunderstood, accept by the\u00a0\u00a0good doctors who are aware the studies that have been ongoing over the past years.Again, it may not be your problem but have you had your vitamin levels checked, if not it has to be worth a try.I know your symptoms must be very worrying for you but hang in there, there are a lot of us in the same boat.Graham",

            "answer": "Hi, I'm 27 years old and last year in October 2001 I started having a stomach pain/disturbance that ended up in acid reflux (U know the gnawing pain in your throath that feels as if a semi-tire spinning slowly) . I took Prevacid and it got fixed. 2 months later my symptoms:1. Pain in the abdomen area (left and right) and a feeling of nausea. I feel as if I've been poisioned 1.5 months of constant sickness. Went to doctors (same routine depressed,\u00a0\u00a0it's in your head etc.) I also started to have hypertension and panic and depressive attacks.Not because I was unhappy but due to the sickness.I also had a 38 hours insomnia that accompanied all of this. I knew then that I'm about to step into something very unormal with my body. I work out and I'm in good shape so this is not an issue.2. Not much later my nausea started to expand and I started to have some unexplained pains inside my head just as electrical pulses and sickening pressure at the base of my skull that felt as if I'm about to faint. The headache seems to be worsened after meals. I also had upper/lower jaw pain that was running through my teeth (randomly) as if I had taken severe bites out of ICE/LEMON. This is very weird since I was never sick in my life. I've been on blood pressure medication and serotonium resoration (paxil) I still believe that all this malfunctions are comming from the\u00a0\u00a0middle of my body (abdomen area) I don't know if I have IBS or what in the world I have. It seems that if I allow air into my stomach and expunge it out I get a little relief (that one needs practice :-)) I've been in this condition for about 8 months already and still don't know what's going on. #2 also looks loose and not like it used to be before. I'm also affraid to drink water (paranoia of lead poisoning etc) Diet coke seems ok.3. February 2002, I started to have muscle spasms and involuntary twiches (small scale). When the nausea was severe; which it was for me for about 1.5 month, all I did is sit around and do absolutely nothing. I looked ok from the outside but something very weird was going on inside.\u00a0\u00a0I'm in good shape and nothing is visible from the outside. I did notice when I had severe pains inside my brain that my pupils were contracting and expanding visibly like my heart beat. Very odd.4. Latest news, March 2002 now I have something new. Pain in my head is 80% less and the new adition is I get dizzy as if someone unplugs me for just a second. I get a sensation of motion sickness that lasts for just a fraction of a second and comes at random times.My teeth only hurt when I go to sleep (upper rabbit teeth) they feel as if someone is applying current to them and mostly when I lay on my back. What in the world is wrong with me.5. I started trying pot as some friend suggested. Yes it does help the nausea (more like it blocks it) but I get the \"current\" like pain inside my skull and the jaw/teeth pain instantly after smoking. This seems to be triggered by the weed. It does help me go through the night but with these side effects.I don't want to smoke weed, I'm not a drinker nor a smoker. Nausea seems to come and go and sometimes i feel sharp stabs around the liver area and sometimes in the opposed side in the pancreas area. Most of the time when I'm nausiated it comes from those two places.I did notice that if I interact and do things the pain goes in the background but I think that's about it. I just forget about it. I'm already sick entire of this weird illness. If anyone has any idea what's going on plz e-mail me.QUICK DESCRIPTION OF MY SYMPTOMS.A. Pain in the spleen area.B. Pain in the pancreas area.C. Pain in the middle upper abdomen.D. Pain in the liver area.E. Heat flashes.F. Weird discomfort.G. Bowels don't look normal, very loose and lots of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0mucus. Long time since hard healty feces. only 10% of time they look ok.H. Trembling (I solder electronics every once in a while)and just found out that I can no longer hold the soldering iron steady (I'm 27)I. Vision blurring... not all the time.J. Stabbing pain in the eyes.K. Mild background pain at the base inside the skull daily.L. Stomach acid. (does not come up my esophagus)M. Motion sickness without being on anything.N. Sex drive down to 0.O. Even when I'm ok I still feel the nausea in the background just waiting to get me.P. That lead heavy pressure in the back of my skull radiating through my gums and snapping & popping.The only thing I can confess is that I do go to sleep very late at nights (computer geek) and being doing it for about 8 years. Still I've never had anything like this.The worst is that doctors don't know what this is.Speculation... IT's being\u00a0\u00a0happening to many people lately starting in year 1999' and up.Anyone that experiences these symptoms please feel free to e-mail me to discuss them further or possibly to develop a pattern of everyone that has this, we might find out what's triggering these. Dust, detergents, animals, water, athmosphere changes, going outside, smoking marijuana, we need to know.Unless the government is restoring the country with our medicine money.****************UPDATE 05/01/02*****************Latest Update, my nausea/ibs symptoms subsided I now experience the back/base of the skull pain/pressure and random pulling on my teeth upper and lower. I also wake up with numb hands. I still have pains left & right of my upper abdomen. I also experince extreme teeth sensitivity only in my upper \"rabbit\" teeth but only when laying on my back.I can wake up with no pain then after any meal or a glass of water I instantly feel the pulling/lead sensation in the back/base of my skull. Also when this occurs I feel sounds as if wafers (popping & snapping sounds) slowly squashed in the back of my head at the base. When this inflating feeling occurs it stops just seconds from being intolerable I also feel as if air is being released through my nose. Activity seems to make these symptoms less painfull and sometimes if I get caught up in a discussion I even forget about them.It's still verry annoying since I had no health problems prior to October 2001.I still don't know what's wrong nor my doc.HELP!!l8r and good luck to everyone and I'll pray for all of us this condition is not something to be unserious about.I'd rather have stiches that this ****.***@****",

I refused to take the medications I was prescribed, i.e. Prevacid, Prilosec because they made the pain worse. Over the past year, I have been experiencing a tingling sensation (no pain, just annoying) on the left side of my back that is transient and feels as if it is going down and it moves over to the right side at times. I frequently get headaches (but that has been the case since I was born), but recently I have gone to a rheumatologist for what he diagnosed as costalchondritis (pain in the left side of my chest and it was hard for me to breathe. (I had just recently moved and I also work out using weights) He prescribed Celebrex. I took it a few times, but the pain subsided by itself. (Can you see that I am not in favor of modern medicine?) Anyway, I've been feeling pains, tingling, itching sensations in my feet (sharp pain under my big toe). I'm used to wearing heels, but in the past have been wearing flat shoes (could this be a source of my pain that my feet are too low the ground affecting my natural arch?) Anyway, I'm scheduled for a neurology appointment today and just found out that my primary physician wants to rule out neuropathy. What is that? Can someone shed some light on this issue?
