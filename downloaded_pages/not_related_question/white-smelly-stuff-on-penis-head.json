            "answer": "Hello,This white smelly stuff can be due to smegma or balanitis skin. You should use any cosmetics on the penis, instead use some topical antimicrobials like Bacitracin or Lotrimin. Also corticosteroids and topical immunosuppressants can be used but they are available under prescription. Also retract the foreskin daily and soak in warm water to clean penis and foreskin.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing",

            "answer": "Hello,I am a 20-year-old single male. About a few days ago I started to get a very itchy penis underneath my foreskin. I haven't had sexual intercourse in a couple months so I know it's not from having sex, but the heat ran out at my house last week, so I heard not washing it could cause this sort of irritation? I have had yeast infection so I know this isn't that, but there is a thin white liquid surrounding the head of my penis under the foreskin, and it's a little swollen. Do I have anything to be seriously worried about?",

            "answer": "Hello Dr. Kaur,I am married and have a routine intercourse with my wife of 20 years. Over the past several months, I keep getting white stuffs around my penis after an intercourse. About two months ago, I was given an antibiotic (one tablet) for yeast infection, which appeared to have cured it. But it is back again this week, after I had an intercourse with my wife 2 days ago. My penis is not as itchy as before, but it is sensitive and lightly itchy. I am no circumcised. Also, the tip of my penis head seems very slightly red and swollen a few hours after an intercourse. I am not sure if my wife has an yeast infection (which she denies) or if the problem is mine? Is it even an yeast infection? How can we cure this for both of us? Thank you.",

            "answer": "Diabetes will increase the chances of having Balanitis, it does not cause smegma. Smegma (the white protein substance) is naturally occurring and can cause balanitis if the area is not kept clean. Men who still have their foreskin are more likely to have this problem as well.",

            "answer": "I have taken comfort and displeasure in the diagnosis that my sugar level is responsible for this condition. I thought my Doctor was nuts. My sugar shot up from 6.5 for years to 9.0 last month when I thought I had an STD. Test confirmed I do not have an STD yet still have yeast infection or Balanitis as listed here. I am 64 and on my second week of Metformin for Diabetes. I suggest you check your sugar levels. Good luck",

Now i am overcoming from this problem by all these methods but not fully because of my uncontrolled sugar levels..",
