            "answer": "I have not seen an HDL that high - and I assume it is not the LDL that is 149.\u00a0\u00a0If it is HDL, then you could ask for an advanced lipid panel (VAP or Berkeley Heart Lab) to see what type of HDL it is -- much of this is probably speculative, but would be worth checking into.More concerning is the BP - would look at the arteries leading to the kidneys to see if there is any narrowing (renal artery stenosis) and look at aldosterone/renin levels to look for hyperaldosteronism (cannot be tested if you are on spironolactone or inspra for BP control) and check for lupus damage to the kidneys to see if this is increasing BP.",

            "answer": "Thanks so much. Yes, it IS HDL, incredible as it seems, and it's not a fluke since it was 112 in '04, 118 in '05 and 144 in '07. I plan to follow up on all your suggestions--it really helps to have some idea of what I should be concerned about and what I can do to get some answers (or at least to know what questions still need answering)! Thanks again.",

    "question": "I have Hashimoto's Disease and have been on Levoxyl for over 15 years. More recently, after going through several horrible years, I finally have a diagnosis of SLE--funny how finding out you have a potentially serious disease can actually be a relief...My question here is about possible heart disease complications. I just got back my most recent Lipid Panel and don't know if I should be worried. I am a 53 year old white female, non-smoker, no diabetes and with a BMI of 21.5 and, of course, Hashimoto's and now\u00a0\u00a0lupus. I am on 3 blood pressure medications now to control what was urgent hypertension (186/116) last summer. BP is now edging up again even with meds. My last lipid panel (fasting) came back with these results (which are consistent with the upward trend of these numbers over the past 7-8 years):Cholesterol Total\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 278TG\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 151HDL\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 149My doc seems to think that since the ratio is good I shouldn't worry about the High Total and what seems to be an unheard of high level HDL. I've read some materials about pro-inflammatory HDL which can actually increase coronary heart disease risk but he dismisses this as \"speculative\" and tells me not to worry about it. He says I\u00a0\u00a0should be happy that I am some sort of HDL Champion. Is he right?? Any ideas? References??",
