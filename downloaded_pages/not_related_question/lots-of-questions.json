            "answer": "Hello,Diabetes could certainly\u00a0\u00a0be the cause behind many of your symptoms including the abdominal pain and the elevated liver enzymes. While you wait for\u00a0\u00a0your next appointment here are some suggestions:--STop drinking sodas entirely. They are pure sugar. Stick to plain water instead.Plus, good hydration is VERY important in diabetes.--decrease or stop sweets entirely, especially while you are not on any medications.--start including high fiber foods(vegetables, fruits, high fiber cereals and breads) into your diet.Be sure not to wait too long for an appointment. The endocrinologist will test you for type 1 diabetes by using specific blood tests including antibodies and a c-peptide level.Get rest, drink lots of water and stay away for sweets in the meantime. Take care.",

            "answer": "Thank you so very much for your immediate reply. I will take your suggestions very seriously. I thought of just one more question. I have had a \"nodule\" (Dr.'s term) growing on the inside base of my index finger. It is very painful if it is touched or bumped. (which I do many times a day) It seems to be growing fairly rapidly. Last week my husband could barley feel it, and this week it is slightly visible.\u00a0\u00a0Could this also be from diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0I have an appointment with a hand doctor at the end of the month. ( they cant get me in sooner, I call every day to see if there are any cancellations.Thanks again,\u00a0\u00a0Kjsmoma",

            "answer": "Hello,I am not sure if the nodule is related to your diabetes or not, it will depend on the cause itself. If it continues to grow quickly and/or becomes painful or red please have your appointment moved up as soon as possible.Take care.",

    "question": "I have had a rough few years. I could sleep every day all day and night long.( i am not depressed, and have tried antidepressants they seemed to help a little, but have really helped my IC) I have had very foggy thinking. I have a few sores that just wont heal. When I looked up diabetes it just screamed, this is it. I have had many different tests, and all have had negative, or false positive readings. Lately my liver enzymes have been elevated. Today my doctor called and let me know that my fasting glucose test was 160. After eating (especially after sweets) I break out in a sweat. I was shocked by the diagnosis and didnt think of questions until much later. She is referring me to a specialist in this area, to help with care, and diet. My initial question is how do I know if I have type 1 or 2 diabetes? How long can I safely wait to be seen by the specialist? Are there any warning signs I should be aware of? I do drink regular soda. (I have interstitial cystitis so I cant have any artificial sweeteners) How concerned should I be? I have felt like I have had the flu for weeks, and months. I have had severe abdominal pain for years. They have taken out my gallbladder, appendix, and have had a total hysterectomy. Could abdominal pain be caused from diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate any insights. Thanks, Kjsmoma",
