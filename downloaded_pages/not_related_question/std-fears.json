            "answer": "Welcome to our Forum.\u00a0\u00a0I can imagine how frustrating it must be for you to be going to different doctors, each of whom is saying, \"not my problem\".\u00a0\u00a0I hope I can help.\u00a0\u00a0Let's work through your situation and see where it takes us.STD Risk.\u00a0\u00a0Your given and received unprotected oral sex over the past year but your genital exposures have been protected.\u00a0\u00a0 This makes the likelihood that your genital symptoms are STDs low, as does the fact that you have tested negative for STDs.\u00a0\u00a0Further, to be honest, your symptoms are not highly suggestive of typical STDs.\u00a0\u00a0As long as you continue to engage in sexual encounters with multiple partners, I would suggest annual \"screening\" (i.e. testing in the absence of symptoms) for STDs, just as a matter of good health practice, just like getting your blood pressure checked or, in your case, following your blood sugars.Could this be related to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Possibly.\u00a0\u00a0Certainly changes in blood sugar can affect the genital tract in a number of ways including through increased urine production, tendency towards dribbling and sensory changes which can occur both chronically and acutely and both of which improve with improved control of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, as your doctor has said, diabetics and particularly those who have less than optimal blood sugar control, can have a tendency to yeast infections which can show up as local irritation and/or a red rash.\u00a0\u00a0These should respond to antifungal therapy however and if your symptoms have not yet, I doubt that this is currently a major contributor to your problem.Other causes such as prostate problems and urinary tract infections occur from time to time but are not overly common.My guess, having just worked through this mentally as well as in writing is that the difficulties you have mentioned are unlikely to be due to STD and more likely to be related to less than optimal blood sugar control.\u00a0\u00a0I doubt that fungal infections are currently a major contributor.Hope these comments are helpful to you.\u00a0\u00a0EWH",

            "answer": "Thank you for your swift reply. I was most concerned about the urine leakage and testicle pain. My doctor has explained that discharge is typically more 'puss-like'. For me, the liquid is identical to urine. It will dribble out on its own, often after physical activity, or if I squeeze the shaft of my penis. I'm now awaiting my meeting with a urologist.My testicle pain seems confined to the left testicle but will sometimes radiate to the right and has now become the 'primary symptom'. It feels as though one testicle is particularly heavy, though there is no swelling, redness or temperature.I've found that my symptoms will come and go (for instance, my irritation at the tip of the penis seems to have disappeared). Is this typical of STDs?",

            "answer": "As I sai before, this really does not suggest STD.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor is correct.\u00a0\u00a0This is more likey a diabetes-related problem than STD.\u00a0\u00a0STD symptoms rarely come and go and the liquid you notice oes not sound infected but sounds like urine.\u00a0\u00a0EWH",

    "question": "I'm a 24 year old male with Type One diabetes. A year ago I began experiencing irritation at the tip of my penis, a burning sensation, and a fullness in my bladder. My doc suggested that diabetics are prone to various infections in the genital area and provided me with an oral Thrush tablet as well as cream. When this proved ineffective, I visited again and was supplied with other fungal creams.When these failed to have any effect, I visited an STD clinic for a series of tests. I tested negative for Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, HIV, and Syphilis (more tests were conducted, but I don't have a definitive list to hand). I was neg. for bladder infections. The STD clinic doctor suggested that my symptoms were likely a result of poorly controlled blood sugar.A few months passed (my symptoms seemed to come and go, which supported the blood sugar theory). However, I've experienced a recurrence with additional symptoms. I've noticed that I appear to be dribbling small amounts of urine at random intervals, and there has been a gradual increase in testicular pain (particularly in the left testicle, but this radiates to the right, also). The liquid is always clear (it is liquidy with no discolouration, no stickyness, etc) and appears to dribble more frequently if physically active. My doc. suggested that the liquid wasn't discharge, but that it didn't fit with typical Thrush symptoms and has since referred me to a urologist.The urine leaking resulted in a rash which appeared and vanished within a 24 hour period (it was similar to diaper rash). However, I've also noticed the area around my thighs are irritable. I have since tried to keep my diabetes under control and the dribble has lessened (the irritation at the tip of my penis and burning has also disappeared).Regarding sexual activity, I've partaken in unprotected oral sex (both giving and receiving) as well as protected sex within the past year. Does this sound like an STD related issue?",
