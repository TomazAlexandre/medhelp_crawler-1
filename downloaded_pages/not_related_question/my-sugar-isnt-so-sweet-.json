            "answer": "Hi,a1c of 11 is really high, and gives you an average blood sugar of over 300.\u00a0\u00a0This is dangerously high.\u00a0\u00a0Consider that normal is typically < 5.0, and even with diabetes people are recommended to be < 7.0.You may need to talk to your doctor about changing medications or even taking insulin.Reducing carbs is great and should help a lot, however, given how high your sugar levels are you probably would need insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have a home meter?\u00a0\u00a0Are you able to check your blood sugar levels at home regularly?\u00a0\u00a0Do you check after eating and see how your sugar levels respond to your reduced carb meals.Actually, I would recommend you ask your Dr to check if you could possibly be type 1 diabetes. This can happen even in adults.Bottom line though, you need to get aggressive treatment (this is both low carb diet and appropriate meds) to get your sugars to a level closer to normal.",

            "answer": "I agree with a previous poster.\u00a0\u00a0Your A1c is a reading of your blood glucose levels for the past 3 months or so.\u00a0\u00a0Trying to change something now in hopes of changing your A1c won't do much.As for your diet, I think you need to watch your carb intake a little better.\u00a0\u00a0If you're going to eat fruit, eat it with protein so it doesn't spike your blood glucose levels.My A1c is best when I eat as few carbs as possible and exercise often.\u00a0\u00a0I drink more water than anything else and snack on things that are high in fiber.Maybe those things will help out.\u00a0\u00a0Hope so.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

            "answer": "Thank you all so much. I honestly have no idea what I'm doing. When I was first diagnosed, I was in such bad shape, I was asleep at the doctors office and they woke me up told me I was diabetic and should check my sugar and that was it! My current doctor has me on medication and checks me every three months, but no one has ever told me what to do, eat, or anything, so I'm winging this the best I know how",

            "answer": "Hi, if your doctor is not providing you with proper information on how to manage diabetes then you really need a new doctor.\u00a0\u00a0 Diabetes needs to be managed aggressively using all of the tools available (medication and lifestyle) to avoid complications.\u00a0\u00a0It is a long term condition, so you have to take responsibility, become an expert, and advocate for what you need for your health.You can learn a lot about management diabetes online.\u00a0\u00a0Here are some starting points:-1. Get a Blood sugar meter.\u00a0\u00a0Without a meter you are driving blind!\u00a0\u00a0The blood sugar meter will be used to test your fasting blood sugar and your post eating blood sugar (about 2 hours after eating).\u00a0\u00a0Using the information\u00a0\u00a0you get from this meter you can work out what foods do and don't raise your blood sugar.2. Diabetes is a problem with carbohydrate metabolism.\u00a0\u00a0ie. your body can't handle sugar normally any more.\u00a0\u00a0The best and most logical approach therefore is to limit your carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Fats tend to have no impact on blood sugar, and protein must less than carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Your carbs will mostly come from non-starchy vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0Grains and starchy vegetables will tend to raise your sugars very quickly. Same goes for sweet fruits.3. If your Dr is not helping you and your medications are not working, then you need a second option.\u00a0\u00a0First line medication for type 2 is Metformin / Glucophage.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you are on this already.\u00a0\u00a0Next best choice is probably insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin always works.4. Have you had proper testing for type of diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0If your blood sugars are not controlled with metformin / diet then maybe need to test in case you have type 1.5. Exercise daily.\u00a0\u00a0At least 30 - 60 minutes a day.6. Lose weight if you are overweight.\u00a0\u00a0It may be hard, but worth it to help management.Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Get the book the obesity code by dr Jason Fung. A year ago my blood sugar was 450 when I was first diagnosed. Last night before bed my sugar was 86 and my fasting sugar this morning was 104 and I haven't been on any medications for 4 months. I've listened to hundreds of podcasts concerning low carb high fat ketogenic diets and completely changed my life and diet accordingly. I've essentially gone to med school and now know more about diabetes than the doctor that diagnosed me. You don't need 30-60 minutes a day of exercise but rather intense exercise of muscles to failure such as push-ups or one leg squats. Interval training is good. It increases sensitivity of muscles to insulin. Search the internet fir dr Ted Naiman in Seattle. Your goal should be to be off your meds and reverse your diabetes like most in the low carb high fat community have done. Intermittent fasting is key as well. It will take education far beyond what your doctor is telling you but YOU have to take control of your health. Otherwise the outcome of insulin resistance is always bad. What you hear about staying healthy simply by managing blood sugar is not true. Unfortunately living with diabetes has a horrible outcome which is why I was determined not to. Incidentally when I went to my doctor and was first diagnosed I was told I was most certainly going to have to go on insulin. These drugs only make your insulin resistance worse. Diet is key.",

            "answer": "Those drugs are simply treating your blood sugar and not your insulin resistance. There are no drugs that treat that. You can reverse the diabetes and get off meds with a low carb high fat diet and intermittent fasting. Again read my post and get the obesity code by Jason Fung. High blood sugars will come down. Incidentally not being overweight and having diabetes carries more risk ironically than an overweight person that develops diabetes.",

Since last month, I've changed my diet the best way I know how. I only have 1 starch a day, and that's a whole wheat starch, 1 serving of fruit, and the rest is veggies, nuts, and seeds. BUT, my readings are still high at times. What else can I do? I go back in another week for another A1C and I really want it to be better.",
