            "answer": "Has your dog been tested for the tick borne diseases (Lyme, Ehrlichia, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Anaplasmosis and others)?\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps testing for endocrine disorders, especially Hypoadrenocorticism, Hyperadrenocortism,\u00a0\u00a0and Diabetes Insipidus would help.Whatever the cause it is essential that your dog drink and eat.\u00a0\u00a0Unlike cats, dogs can fast temporarily without problems, but they must drink.\u00a0\u00a0She should be hospitalized and given IV fluid therapy if she is not drinking.\u00a0\u00a0If she continues not to eat she should be given an appetite stimulant, such as Mirtazipine.\u00a0\u00a0Please coax her with any kind of food, even people foods.If this is an infectious process at fault, than antibiotics should be given even if she is not eating.\u00a0\u00a0Antibiotics can be delivered by injection.\u00a0\u00a0Your vet can give you prefilled syringes of antibiotics and can instruct you in giving the antibiotic.\u00a0\u00a0Giving needles is not difficult.\u00a0\u00a0Owners of pets with diabetes must give insulin to their pets, sometimes for the life of their pets.",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for your response.\u00a0\u00a0It was helpful to guide me toward keeping my dog hydrated while I waited for her symptoms to become clear.\u00a0\u00a0Yesterday, we went to a specialist and she was diagnosed with Addison's Disease--a treatable disease, which is characterized by Hypoadrenocorticism.\u00a0\u00a0The key signs of Addison's were that her adrenal glands looked smaller on second ultrasound and her blood had begun to show changes in her elecrolytes--in sodium and potassium levels and in cortisol.\u00a0\u00a0An ACTH test confirmed the diagnosis. She had to be hospitalized while treatment is begun, but her prognosis is good.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this is helpful to other dog owners out there.",
