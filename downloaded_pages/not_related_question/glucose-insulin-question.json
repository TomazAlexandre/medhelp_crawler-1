            "answer": "Hi,Your doctor has the benefit of all your history and lab values to review, but based on what you have said I think you more likely have insulin resistance--this is a condition where you are making lots of insulin, but it does not work very well and so your blood sugars can become high(into diabetic range). Insulinomas cause low blood sugars, so this is not likely what you have. Speak with your doctor again and ask about insulin resistance, as well as asking why he/she thinks this is likely an insulinoma(they are VERY different diagnoses).There may be additional information leading him/her to that diagnosis.Take care.",

    "question": "Hi! Newbie here! This may sound a little strange but I am currently suffering with Hyperglycemia (Glucose ranges between 140-250) AND High Insulin (Insulin at around 220). I do not take insulin and have never had diabetes. Has anyone ever heard of someone suffering from both at the same time? It is not even in my family and neither is obesity. But I am very overweight myself (228lbs) and stand only 5'6. My endocrinologist thinks I have an Insulinoma but I have no problems with Hypoglycemia.Just curious!Lizzie",
