            "answer": "It is unlikely you have a left sided cardiomyopathy with an EF of 70%. You may have inappropriate sinus tachycardia ( IST) which can be caused by physical decompensation or by intrinsic problems with the sinus node. If your right heart function is normal then I would advise you to undergo an EP study to modify your sinus node so it won't be as responsive to catecholamines as it presently is. If you have right heart dysfunction, this is\u00a0\u00a0more difficult to achieve and may not even be possible, because the right heart trying to augment cardiac output which it can only by increasing the heart rate ( because of its intrinsic dysfunction).",

            "answer": "Wow, I can't believe I was able to post a question! Thanks for time.I'm under the care of Carl Pepine, MD for microvascular ischemia. I don't have diabetes, am not overweight, but began having heart-related symptoms during my recent third pregnancy. The palps I describe have worsened over the past few years. I thought they were related to prednisone (a med I've taken over the years for colitis and asthma) but I haven't been on the Rx for months.I've been told by one cardio that the right side of my heart is mildly dysfunctional; another doc said the cause is ischemic cardiomyopathy from the small vessel disease.Dr. Pepine believes the symptoms are related to the small vessel disease but hasn't changed any of my meds yet (lisinopril, inspra, ranexa, zocor). He also hasn't formally diagnosed me with IDC because my EF is 70%.Blessings,C",

    "question": "Hi,I have small vessel disease with enlargement of the right atrium. All chambers are upper limits.Every time I eat a meal, I experience a forceful tachycardia of approximately 100 that makes me feel tired. I lay down if I can. It takes about an hour for the symptoms to go away.I've worn a Holter which has recorded the palps at the rate above. The rhythm is normal but fast.What could be causing this? Could the atrium and esophagus be involved somehow?Thanks in advance for your time.Carolina",
