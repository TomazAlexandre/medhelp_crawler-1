You may also have inflammation of the sternum or ribs (costochondritis).",

I had the attack weighing 205 and since have stayed at 192 for the last 2 yrs.\u00a0\u00a0 i have given up on any real big weight loss, it's a battle to stay where i am.I realize i should be grateful for the strides i have made since that day, but....i have some questions that seem to get brushed off by all doctors.i have what feels like a spasm of pain in my upper quadrant, rib part over my right breast that comes and goeswhen it does show up, its very painful, but doesnt last more than 10 seconds, then that spot is sore to touch.i still have sternum pain in the left side, that also is sore.\u00a0\u00a0i get days, where i feel like i can't breath deep enough.if you can give me your opinion, i would appreciate it.Lyn",
