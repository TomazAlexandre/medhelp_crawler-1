            "answer": "Hi betes!\u00a0\u00a0I am the mom of an 18 year old who was diagnosed at the age of 21 months.\u00a0\u00a0I am not a medical professional, so any information I pass on to you should be verified with your healthcare team.After doing some research on the medhelp website, and based on personal experience, let me share some of my thoughts with you on this most embarassing problem.\u00a0\u00a0When you try to eat a healthy, well balanced diet, keep your weight within a healthy range and manage good blood glucose levels, you need to eat the foods that are the primary culprits of gas (fruits & veggies, whole grains, dairy products, packaged foods w/lactose such as bread, cereal & salad dressings and dietic foods such as sugar free gum and candies).\u00a0\u00a0Go figure.\u00a0\u00a0If you have maintained good bg control over the past 5 years, hopefully your diabetes is not the cause of this problem.\u00a0\u00a0You should seek the opinion of a gastroenterologist to confirm that your symptoms are nothing more than the result of eating plenty of whole grains, fruits & veggies and dairy products.\u00a0\u00a0Any of these foods can create gas that can become problematic to some.\u00a0\u00a0Swallowed air can create excessive gas also.\u00a0\u00a0Are you a big gum chewer?\u00a0\u00a0Did you know that the average person passes gas 14-23 times per day?\u00a0\u00a0You may want to keep a diary of the foods you're eating (yes, even the gum), and how many times you've passed gas on a daily basis before visiting the doctor as this would be a great tool to help eliminate other more serious causes or help pinpoint your problem.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the digestion of a person with diabetes can be slowed down and the proper enzymes to digest food can be affected, so you really should be seen by a specialist to determine the root of your problem.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck to you!",
