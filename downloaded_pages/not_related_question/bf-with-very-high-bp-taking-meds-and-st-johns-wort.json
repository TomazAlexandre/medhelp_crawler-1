            "answer": "Hi there. Firstly I am not a doctor, you need medical advice, however I will try help a little. its possible that you have your first comment in reverse. I think the high Bp causes the LVH. Well the start is to look at the current meds, A water tablet and Ace inhibitor combination twice a day. Also a beta blocker too. Sometimes it takes a fair amount of trial and error in the BP meds to find the correct dose and combination. But this is vitally important, so he has to go back to the doctor and work at it till the BP is under control. How can he have Diabetes undiagnosed? ....a bit confusing. Was he tested when he had his coronary assessment? Well I wonder exactly what Heart tests he has had? Ecg & Echo I guess? What blood work was done? (Diabetic test is one usually part of routine work) Has he insisted that any possible secondary causes are outruled? Did he have an Angiogram test or a 24 hour AMBP test. Don't think im rude but he is your BF. He owes it to you to sort out his health for your future? Time to make a list of his problems with him and go back to the doctor, work together and get that BP down under 130. Act now,",

            "answer": "Lydia believe it or not he has a point... I'm not saying don't go back to the doctor but it can be confusing. I had to go back over and over because they keep giving me meds that caused an allergic reaction . Guess what it makes your blood pressure go up higher! It just going to keep going back to you get something that works. I am on A clonidine patch and take a hundre and take a hundred milligrams of metatoprol\u00a0\u00a0Anna point one clonidine to go with my patch. Its working for now but I sometimes get spikes. He might want to look into clonidine patch you just stick it on your arm and it works for 7 days with other medication of course but I would back off some of the other meds after the patch to see if they were really needed or if they were causing the problem. Good luck",

    "question": "Hi my boyfriend is 53 and has a thickened left ventricle which causes very high BP. He is taking metaprolol 50mg twice a day now and lisinopril / hydrochlorothiazide 20mg/25mg twice daily also. In addition he has been very depressed and has started taking SIX 300mg pills of St. John's wort daily. He just measured his BP because he didn't feel good and it was 170/95 and it's been higher than that. He will not listen to me or go back to his doctor, I feel like the St. John's wort is making it worse. I don't know what to do! Please someone help me?",
