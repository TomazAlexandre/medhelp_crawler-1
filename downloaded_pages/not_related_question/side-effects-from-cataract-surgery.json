            "answer": "This is called corneal edema and is due to shock waves coming off the phaco handpiece hitting the corneal endothelium.\u00a0\u00a0It can also be caused by chunks of the cataract bumping into the cornea.\u00a0\u00a0It is more common with dense, hard cataracts requiring a lot of phaco energy or more phaco power.\u00a0\u00a0It is also more common in people with unhealthy corneas which is sometimes the case in much older eyes with dense cataracts.\u00a0\u00a0Bottom line is that the edema will resolve in about 99% of the time - so the odds are on her side.\u00a0\u00a0I've done over 8000 cases and never had a case where the edema didn't resolve - although statistically I know that it will remain in some patients.\u00a0\u00a0It should be much better in a week and hopefully very clear in a few weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Follow the doctor's instructions - this is a very routine situation.\u00a0\u00a0Rarely the edema or cloudines does not go away - if not better in a few weeks you may want to post again.MJK MD",
