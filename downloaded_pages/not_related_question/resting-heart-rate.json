    "question": "I am a 30 year old male and was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. I also had several episodes of panic attacks. After 4 months of treatment with carbimazole & propranolol, I am now clinically euthyroid and there's no more panic attacks & tachycardia.I have been doing brisk walking for last one month. I started slowly, but now I walk briskly on plain surface, slopes and stairs. I walk approx 2 miles everyday for 45 minutes.I have been still advised to be on Carbimazole 20 mg. I take 1/4th of a 10mg Propranolol in the morning and 1/4th is the night. So, it's 5 mg in a day.Recently I observed that when I wake up in the morning, my heart rate is around 62 - 68. Full day it hangs around 68 - 76. It only crosses 100 and touches 160 when I am doing my evening walks.One night when I was about to sleep, I checked my heart rate and it was 62. I heard normal heart rate should be between 60 - 100. Mine seems to be slipping down. This gave me a small panic attack and my anxiety is back. I heard that slow heart rates can cause sudden death. I am afraid for my health.I cannot stop on Carbimazole and the little Propranolol that I take. Should I approach a specialist or do you thing that this condition is benign? Also, can I stop Propranolol and start with Clonazepam on as-need-basis?P.S.: Also, I have no cholesterol, no diabetes, do not smoke (quit 4 months back) and drink very rarely. All other tests results are normal. Only my thyroid levels fluctuate. T3 is normal, T4 is little bit high in decimals. And TSH is 0.01. I am overweight, but am trying to lose weight. My mother too has hyperthyroidism. She is euthyroid now. My BP was high during panic attacks and anxiety episodes, but normally it is 120/80. I was advised to take anti-depressant, but decided against it. The walks that I do has partially helped me overcome my fears. But I read too many internet articles and a recent one about slow heart rate has given me health anxiety.",
