            "answer": "Hi ThereYou have a cyst on your left ovary. I usually recommend having cysts that are bigger than 5 cm removed because they can cause pain. They are sometimes associated with malignancies but most are benign.Having had a breast cancer can increase the risk of malignancy and sometimes if you are going to have surgery, you could consider the prophylactic removal of the other ovary at the same time.best wishes",

    "question": "Please help what does this report indicate. I've had cyst before...but never this big or descibed as such. I want to know what to expect in the way of test, surguries, and the likley outcome.I am 45 years old, pre-menopausal. An additional symptom I have been suffering with is dizzy spells which I figured are related to low blood sugar. Though I have never been dignosed with diabetes and do have anual physical. I have to wait till Dec. 17 to get into to talk to my family doctor about the ultrasound report as well as this additional symptom. See report.My report say...The right ovary appears normal, diameters 19 by 12 by 11mm. The Left ovary is 68 by 62 by 60 mm, it acontains a septated sonolucency, overall diameters 68 by 62 by 60 mm so ;th entire left adnexal structure that looks like the ovary is actually a multi loculated or septated cystic structure.Th cul de sac is clear. The bladder is normal.Conclusion: The left ovary is enlarged by a sonolucency (what does this word mean?) that I think represents either a loculated cyst or a multi septated cyst. The wasll does not appear to be thickened.Thanks for any and all answers.Miss DorathyPs BTW I am also a young 41 breast cancer surviver",
