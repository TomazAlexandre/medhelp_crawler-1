    "question": "I've been diagnosed with depression & take medications for that. I have allergies & take medication for that. I've just gotten diagnosed with Type II diabetes & hypertension & am taking medications for that. I tried to lump all of the meds w/ the warnings \"may cause drowsiness\" for my nighttime doses (unless otherwise directed) which I take 1-2 hours before bedtime, & go to bed no later than 11:30. No matter what I do, I cannot make myself get out of bed before 8:30. I really want to exercise or do other activities in the morning before work, but I never wake up in enough time & when I do get up, I feel like a zombie. And the feeling lasts all day long. Last week I fell asleep on the toilet @ work. My doctor referred me to the psych nurse that prescribes my depression meds, but the last time I talked to her & my therapist about my fatigue, they didn't take it very seriously. One doctor told me to \"go to bed earlier\" & suggestions to exercise feel like a catch-22. Any suggestions that I can take to the \"meds nurse\" &/or my doctor to resolve this?",
