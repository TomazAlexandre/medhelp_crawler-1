            "answer": "HI,It is possible for you to improve all of those numbers with a good diet and exercise program. However at this time I think you need to be started on medication as well because those numbers are quite high. When Triglycerides are above 500 you run the risk of an inflamed pancreas which can be quite dangerous and life threatening. You most definitely have insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. From those numbers you already have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The medication does not need to be permanent necessarily--if you lose weight etc and the numbers come down to normal you may need minimal medication. However at this time you should be on some medication for your safety. Please speak to your doctor as soon as possible regarding this.Take care.",

            "answer": "Hi,Good work starting on exercise routine and changing your diet--that is a necessity.The starting dose of Zocor is usually lower than the maximum dose, especially when combined with another agent. Your doctor may have felt that your lipids were so high more aggressive action needed to be taken. The risks of side effects are higher with the maximum doses of these medications, especially when used together, so speak to your doctor about perhaps starting at a mid-level dose instead.It is not always necessary to check the CPK after starting these medications. Often doctors check it only if you have symptoms such as muscle pains or cramps.Your serum creatinine is not necessary for these medications but it always helpful to know.You should also speak to your doctor again about diabetes. Fasting value of 150mg/dl is consistent with diabetes.Take care.",

            "answer": "HI,Given how high your cholesterol was in the past,I doubt that you can do without medications altogether. I think it is reasonable to discuss a lower dose with your doctor and between you both decide the course to take.\u00a0\u00a0Your lipid panel right now is excellent, and this is while on medication as well as after dietary changes, so I am sure the medication did play a role in its return to normal.Your blood sugars are still not normal and now on the borderline: you have impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance based on those numbers you\u00a0\u00a0communicated. There is no definite recommendation at this time regarding medication treatment for these levels of abnormal glucose handling, but in many cases where other issues are present(such as high cholesterol, being overweight, family history of diabetes and high blood pressure) some doctors will start a low dose of Metformin. That is something you may consider discussing with your doctor as well.Take care and keep up the excellent work.",
