            "answer": "The most efficacious treatment for cats with eosinophilic disease complex, of which eosinophilic plaque is one component,\u00a0\u00a0is Depo-medrol injections every 2 to 4 weeks, with antibiotics for secondary skin infection.\u00a0\u00a0 Depo-medrol or other steroid injections can cause diabetes in susceptible individuals (especially obese cats), but, it is a necessary part of the treatment.\u00a0\u00a0It might be a good idea to place your cat on a hypoallergenic canned diet such as prescription lamb and pea, or equivalent.\u00a0\u00a0The hypoallergenic diet must be foods that your cat has never been exposed to before.\u00a0\u00a0Also, trying to identify any other allergens would be important.\u00a0\u00a0Flea or mosquito allergy is still a possibility since one bite on your pet could cause the disease and you need never see the mosquito or flea.\u00a0\u00a0A topical flea, tick and mosquito repellent is necessary even for the indoor only patient.",

            "answer": "There are dozens of topical flea and tick treatments available.Revolution is good for fleas,and can help for mosquito's, but is ineffective for most ticks.Frontline is good for fleas and ticks, but not mosquitoes.Advantage is only for fleas.There are a variety of over the counter products, but in my practice (and many other practices) we have found that we see the most hypersensitivity reactions and adverse complications from over-the-counter products not listed above.I would not use an over-the-counter product that promises to repel fleas, ticks, mosquitoes and flies.\u00a0\u00a0These products contain too many insecticides which may impact on your pets heath in the future.",
