    "question": "I wrote on 4/6\u00a0\u00a0re my wife was diagnosed w/ spasming arteries after a recent cath that showed patent new stents (5 wks) and patent LIMA & SVG grafts post CABG (1 yr 4 mos). You wrote to take my wife to the E.R. after I explained she had a terrible bout with angina a day earlier.\u00a0\u00a0 She wasn\u2019t feeling worse and spoke with the Dr (who ignored her symptoms the week before) and as it turns out you were correct!\u00a0\u00a02 days later, she couldn\u2019t even walk down the steps and we went to the ER and her troponin level was high and the CBK #s elevated but coming down.\u00a0\u00a0She had a heart attack without changing the EKG.\u00a0\u00a0It was a clot in the stent.\u00a0\u00a0 Our interventional cardiologist was away and his partners wouldn\u2019t touch it and made her wait for 3 days in the E.R. for his return.\u00a0\u00a0She had i.v. nitro and heperin.\u00a0\u00a0Was that safe?\u00a0\u00a0She is now taking lovenox injections to see if this prevents further clots because 1 platelet count came back slightly elebvated and it should have been zero (it was 288)..\u00a0\u00a01) Have you ever heard of lovenox injections to prevent further clots in stents and 2) what are the risks from lovenox to her relatively healthy kidneys (after 30+ yrs of diabetes)?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your good advice.\u00a0\u00a0You were the only Dr. who said E.R.",
