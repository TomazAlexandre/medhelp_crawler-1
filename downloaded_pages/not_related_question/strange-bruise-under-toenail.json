    "question": "Hi there -I noticed a small bruise under the toenail of my big toe maybe 3 or 4 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0I had no idea how it happened, when it appeared, etc.\u00a0\u00a0My best idea is I injured it in Aug, when I fell down some stairs and sprained the other ankle.\u00a0\u00a0I don't remember it bruising then, though.In any case, the bruise spot (and I'm not sure its a bruise, just using that for lack of a better word) has remained, and is slowly getting bigger, to where its now covering the entire left side of the nail.\u00a0\u00a0The top of the nail is white, which it didn't used to be.It doesn't hurt, ache, etc.\u00a0\u00a0A friend of mine saw it and was far more concerned than I have been, so here I am asking.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas?\u00a0\u00a0Need for concern?\u00a0\u00a0I figure I'll lose the nail, probably just in time for sandal season lol, but any need for concern beyond that?Thanks,Jess",
