            "answer": "Hector, do you know that excercise stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin?\u00a0\u00a0I am a type 2 diabetic, for the past 3 years now.\u00a0\u00a0At first, I thought life ended as I knew it! I was scared and confused and had NO idea about my disease.\u00a0\u00a0I learned what I had to do by reading and reading and asking questions. :)\u00a0\u00a0Diet (meaning good nutrition) and excercise can keep your glucose levels pretty level. :)\u00a0\u00a0I now try to walk whenever possible, and TRY to lose weight, which is hard, but slowly i'm managing to do so.Try getting out and walking or riding or whatever you're comfortable with.\u00a0\u00a0Keep up on your heath check ups, and glucose tests if you've been instructed to take them, and I bet your sugar levels will stay pretty level. :) Good luck and keep your chin up!As CoWriter said, use this as a sort of warning, or heads up and learn from it.",

            "answer": "I know this is an older post, but caught me eye. This is my first posting here in forums, I'm somewhat in the same boat. My first Aic blood test was Jan 12, 2017. Was a 5.7. Reason of testing was recommended by my pain management Dr. I had spinal fusion in January 2011, degenerative disc disease. L4, L5 and S1. Doc said should be fully healed from surgery within 4 months. It never healed. 2012, Surgeon did a rescan and seen all the screws and hardware was loose. So Sep. 11 2012 he reopened the scar and removed all hardware, did bone grafts and replaced with bigger hardware and screws. Worst shape now then I've ever been. Since the 2 fusions, went from 145 pounds before fusion and now weigh 220. Can't exactly do a sit up. Nerve damage in hips and legs. I can't walk on my own and constant 24/7 pain from mid back down to feet. Legs and feet feel like needles and burning. Surgeon said nothing more he could do, and left me in Pain Management care since 2012. 9 to 11 pills a day. The disc disease is now up into the T levels, mid and upper back, disc are 50% to 100% gone. P.M. Dr suggested seeing the surgeon again for more fusions. I told him that would be suicide, cause it's gotten to were even the smallest cuts don't heal, so that put me in big fear of another fusion. It was like a light bulb went off in his head and asked if I've ever been tested for diabetes. I said no, but it does run throughout everyone on my moms side. Even my 2 sisters have it. So I've been pricking my finger 2 to 3 times per day since January this year. As I said, A1c blood test in January was 5.7. I go back for another test May 11th. My daily meter and this app shows avg. 6.3 A1c. The only time I'm ever under 100 is when I first wake up. Rest of the day runs from 126 to 200. Highest I've been is 214. And lowest ever was 55, and that was at 5pm, the very first day of finger pricks. I don't know much about diabetes but I am trying to educate myself as much as I can. My ex wife is a RN, she said very possible I'm type 2 or at the least, Pre-Diabetic...Thoughts??Thank You and sorry for the novel.Gene",
