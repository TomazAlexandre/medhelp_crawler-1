    "question": "I'm not trying to be insensitive, i just don't want an employee to use diabetes as an excuse to get the schedule they want. This person has been given the same early shift every time scheduled. I am now asking that they do one 10am to 630pm shift with lunch a week as opposed to all 7am- 330shift. they say they can't do it because of their insulin. if they are being truthful, i have no problem keeping the schedule the same. Otherwise, I need my 2nd in charge to have at least one later shift. they have done it before..Is it necessary for them to be on a strict work schedule where they can't do that one day a week where they go in 3 hours later and out 3 hours later? can't they plan accordingly and bring what they need?",
