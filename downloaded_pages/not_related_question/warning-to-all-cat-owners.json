            "answer": "thank you, I feel sooo sorry for my Angel Grantas that I got this knowledge so late. I always fed him the best and expensive grade canned, pouched, dry food from the vets or pet shops and was very proud of myself that I care so much about him. But now I know that every day I gradually had been poisoning him. I feel like I have to pass this information to as many cat owners as I can. Just cannot find the way yet",

    "question": "hi, everybody I just lost my cat with lots of health issues, such as bad teeth, arthritis, liver dysfunction, kidney and the heart. I made a huge research on internet before and after his death and shortly I would say never feed your cat commercial or even worse dry food. I cannot understand how the factories and veterinary claim that it's a balanced diet for your kitty if there you can find very little amount of meat and it's absolutely processed food and plenty of grains, rice, sugar, vegetables,salt ( dry food even have different type of fungus and no moisture). Its all poison to your love one. Cats are absolute carnivores in their nature, they don't have enzymes to digest all this. If you feed them daily they get constant inflammation in there little bodies, that could cause gum inflammation, diabetes, kidney diseases, liver, thyroid and finally heart problems\u00a0\u00a0and then you treating them in veterinary for crazy amounts of euros because you love them soooo much and the worse that the most medication more killing them then healing. Im not saying that there is no other reasons for that, but the huge difference in your pet health is right FOOD.They need just fresh meats and poultry, taurine, omega 3 and some other nutrients in their diet. You can easily make it yourself just google raw food for cats, or buy a bit more expensive ready made frozen raw food. Please please please stop poisoning your BEST FRIENDS!",
