            "answer": "I suggest going to see a specialist called a Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility specialist because you need a more complete work up for your condition.You must rule out diabetes and cushing syndrome, because of your symptoms of swollen abdomen, frequent urination.I also suggest that you increase you medication Synthroid until the TSH approaches 2.0.This must be done by a specialist like a Reproductive Endocrinologist.",
