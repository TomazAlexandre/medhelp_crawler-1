            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine your uncle and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.I am not sure I completely understand the symptoms or the EMG findings you describe above, nor what K/C/O means, but if there is weakness of the thumb, combined with evidence of a focal neuropathy evidenced on the EMG, one possibility is carpal tunnel syndrome, which is not uncommon in diabetics. The carpal tunnel is the area in the wrist that the median nerve passes through. If the median nerve is compressed in the carpal tunnel, it can cause symptoms in the first three digits of the hand most often, but in some patients shooting pains can occur all the way up to the elbow. The symptoms are often worst at night. Weakness occurs in more severe cases. Carpal tunnel syndrome can be caused by repetitive movements at the wrist like typing. Treatment includes wearing a wrist brace and only in severe cases surgery. Other possible causes include a more generalized neuropathy as occurs in diabetes, or depending on the exact signs and symptoms and examination, a radiculopathy (or pinched nerve).These disorders described above are in general not serious or critical conditions; they may progress if the underlying disorder is not addressed, but in most cases, further nerve damage can be prevented with interventions, and improvement can occur with physical therapy. Continued followup with the neurologist is recommended.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

            "answer": "Thanks a lot, Dr. Yes, it certainly helped me understand the nature of his problem. Sorry for being vague abt K/C/O- over here, it means a Known Case Of.I had examined my uncle according to the rules of neurological examination. He has a difficulty in pronouncing the words which containg the letter \"R\"- those words are more like mumbling. He has mild thenar and hypothenar wasting on both palms. There is no other significant finding, Doctor. Conscious, oriented and afebrile, good understanding, intellect and memory. A Recent MRI scan revealed a normal imaging study with mild arteriolarsclerosis. He does not complain of vertigo, tinnitus.I would like to know the prognosis. I do understand that its very tough to handle and pass a comment on a neurological case without first hand examination of the patient. Thank You Doctor.",
