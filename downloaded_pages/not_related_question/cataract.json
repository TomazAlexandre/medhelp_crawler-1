    "question": "In Nov 06 I had a minor car accident. Airbags deployed but no eye trauma or injury. I went to get glasses after the accident and there were no problems. By Oct 07, I had a full blown cataract in the left eye and one starting in the right eye. I had surgery done in Nov 07 and everything is fine. Now my right eye is getting cloudy so I think its time to go back and get the right eye done. I am 37 years old.My question is how can a cataract develop so fast? I went to my primary doctor and he found nothing. All my doctors are kind of taking this lightly saying I just have bad genetics. I fear that I may have a disease or something causing this. What should I have my primary doctor look for? Anything disease that may be rare or out of the ordinary I should test for. Thanks!",
