            "answer": "I would call your OB-GYN and get checked.\u00a0\u00a0Vaginal itching can be a sign of diabetes, among other things.This was the first sign my daughter had and she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.If the GYN does not do a glucose (sugar) test, a GP or an Internal Medicine doc can do this as it is a simple test.In fact now, my doctor does thyroid testing (especially on women)and glucose tests on all his patients every year.Good Luck",

    "question": "I have had a recent major change in the \"chemistry\" of my vaginal area.\u00a0\u00a0I have gone from having what I've always considered a pretty strong odor (although my doctor has told me it is normal) to no odor at all and tremendous itching.\u00a0\u00a0The itching is maddening and occurs off and on for no apparent reason.\u00a0\u00a0Benadryl seems to help.\u00a0\u00a0On close inspection, there is no dry skin, no \"crabs\", nothing to indicate why it would be doing this.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be hormonal?\u00a0\u00a0I am a 38-year-old female, who has had three children, started my period at age nine, and have had no organs removed.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a chronic autoimmune disorder, polymyositis, for the last 12 years.\u00a0\u00a0I am currently taking no medication.\u00a0\u00a0No change in diet, no new soaps, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Any advice would be appreciated!\u00a0\u00a0I do plan on going to the doctor at some point, but I'm not sure whether to see a gynecologist, endocrinologist, dermatologist, or other, so I would like to start here.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again!",
