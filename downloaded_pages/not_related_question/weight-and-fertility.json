            "answer": "I suggest that you go to a doctor who can assess all your hormonal functions. You may have problems with your thyroid which can be checked by a blood test called TSH. If you are not having regular periods and gaining weight you may also have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and should have your hormones checked for this as well and have a 2 hour glucose tolerance test with a 75 gram glucose challenge to rule out diabetes or pre-diabetes. Please go to a doctor who is willing to do this kind of assessment and testing.",

            "answer": "Dear Sweety372,I'm no nutrition expert, but I used to run track for the University of Florida where I witnessed girl's doing drastic things to lose weight and many suffered from anorexia & bulimia (sp?). When I saw that in your question it threw up a flag for me. I keep in touch with many of my team mates and noticed that 4 out of 5 of them are now suffering from major thyroid and adrenal disfunction. If your thyroid or adrenals are off in any way it can cause massive weight gain (especially in the lower extremities), mood swings, all kinds of things including problems with cycles & fertility. Unfortunately all four of the girl's (all were bulimic) are now having major problems with conception.I would go to your doctor, and demand they test your thyroid. If it's off there are fantastic natural remedies that are so much better than the drugs they offer today.Peace and happiness....",

            "answer": "i have currently seen three doctors about this in the last 4 months. All of them pre judge me as i walk through the door as over eating which is angering me because if that was the case i wouldnt be wondering why i was getting bigger. I wrote a 6 week diary based on what i eat (not a diet) most days i have one meal somedays just a few pieces of toast but while i recognise its not healthy i shouldnt be 15st i dont think\u00a0\u00a0I have to wait 6 wks for my medical papers to be sent to a new surgery and in the mean time the doctors at the hospital (who do believe me) are passing me round each other. I have an appointment for an ultrasound pcos in 2 wks via these doctors. I had thyroid tests but they come up with nothing.Someone asked me to look into cushings?? syndrome. Just before the weight gain i was getting huge bouts of rage for stupid things never actually hitting out but wanting to shaking incredibly, i have a lot of weight at the top of my back like a hump and you cannot really tell my face from my neck anymore.???? I dont know i feel like im having to do this myself because when i walk through a door people have an automatic assumption without checking me over and when im asking to be checked they sigh and tell me to stop eating. Someone said cos my calories were so low my body maybe storing fat but at this weight there is NO way im going to increase it because im terrified ill balloon!!",

            "answer": "I just wanted to tell you I know what your talking about if you go in to the doctor's office and tell them you think something's wrong because you're gaining weight with no reasonable explanation they automatically assume that it's because you're overeating and not exercising. It's happen to me too. I'm not a doctor by no means but it sounds like you have something not right. If you're eating 1000 calories or less and still gaining something is wrong. I used to eat very little and I didn't gain unless I did eat more like a normal person. You should be staying at about the same weight or even losing. Good luck.",
