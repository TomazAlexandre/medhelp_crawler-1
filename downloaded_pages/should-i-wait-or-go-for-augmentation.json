    "question": "I lost 24 pounds due to Type 1 Diabetes. I went down to 94 pounds. When this happened I went from a C cup to about an A cup. I have been able to gain some of the weight back but not in my breasts. I would like to be back to my original size but from what I am being told from my endo I might only get my weight back to around 110 or so. I would like some input on should I go for the augmentation or should I wait and see about the weight gain? I just want to be back to normal, and have my top fit etc.ThanksMel",
