            "answer": "I recommend that you go to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) website at www.jdrf.org and click on the link to the Online Diabetes Support Team (ODST), then fill out the request form that pops up. Ask this question, and you will be put in touch with the staff person who handles requests for supplies. I also suggest that you ask to be contacted by the nearest local chapter of JDRF, for there may be an individual in your area who has spare supplies, and it is extremely helpful for type 1 diabetics in an area to network.",
