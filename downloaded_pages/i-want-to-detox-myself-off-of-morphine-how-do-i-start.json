    "question": "I have taken morphine for 5 years. I am currently taking more than is prescribed. I am prescribed up to 270 mg per day but I can easily take twice that on most days. I do know that this dose would easily kill anyone starting out on morphine. I have many health issues including diabetes which I am insulin dependent. I never realized how serious a diabetes diagnosis really is. It is like getting diagnosed with Heart disease, kidney disease, and blindness at the same time. I have no feeling in my feet and increasingly bad eye sight. I have to change eye glass RX twice per year. I am taking 3 kinds of insulin. This disease is insane!!!! I have gone to treatment many times in my life and many times I have found myself at the bottom of the barrel! Once again at the age of 57 I am at the bottom of the barrel and this time I am the one who is giving up on life but I have many people who care for me and have sacrificed their life for mine. I owe them big time!!! How can I detox myself. I am insane trying to do this with little help. I have a primary health care doc and a psychiatrist who are helping me. Please give some answers and advice. Thank You.",
