She suggested steroid shots though just in case it wouldn't stop.As for now, I've been 3 days straight on bed rest and I'm actually not having any contractions! Bed rest is so not a party! :( my back aches and my legs are stiff. But any time I get up (to bathroom or eat..) I get too much pressure down thereI'm thinking positive and hope my baby will stay inside for another week! I'm hitting 36 weeks tomorrow, 8 more days to 37, yay!",

I don't know how they determine who is a candidate. I will say though if you have any options other than magnesium do it. Magnesium is horrible it makes you feel like your burning up from the inside out and want to crawl out of your own skin.I delivered my daughter at 33 weeks. She was completely healthy because we did the steroid shots to develop her lungs. At 35 weeks your little one should be completely healthy with a dose of steroids. Just a little small.",

    "question": "Everybody seems to be looking for advice on how to bring in labor and ironically enough I'm seeking advice to stop it.I'm 35w 5d, with strong contractions, cervix 60% effaced and 2cm dilated. I need to stop these contractions any possible way. I want my baby to be inside for at least 9 more days (week 37)!I have gestational diabetes and I have been on a very strict diet to keep glucose under control.. I read that I should be eating 2400 - 2500 calories and I'm barely eating 1500.I have been in bed rest for 2 days straight and the contractions have decreased. However if I stand for too long I still get them.Please any advice?? Any input is so much appreciated!!",
