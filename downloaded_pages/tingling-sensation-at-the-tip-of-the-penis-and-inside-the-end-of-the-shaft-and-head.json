            "answer": "Hello,Prostatae infections is one of the causes of penile tingling but it has been ruled out in your case. Some other causes which can present with penile tingling esp. at the tip of penis are gonorrhea, Chlamydia( less likely in your case if you are not sexually active), dermatitis, bacterial urethritis and diabetes. Since you have had an attck of UTI, so definitely urtehritis needs to be evaluated by taking a clean catch sample or mid stream sample. Other causes are peripheral neuropathy, peripheral nerve trauma, nerve entrapment or neurological causes.You need to consult a urologist and get your blood sugar levels done. All these possibilities also need to be ruled out one by one. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your response. I really appreciate that. I just found out today that my Urologist is sick and his office is unsure of his date of return. I'll have to visit my Family doctor next week.Sir, is it possible that there could be Prostatitis? I read that Urine stream could be clear of infection unless Prostatitis spreads to bladder. Is this correct? Will a Digital Rectum Exam reveal presence/absence of Prostatitis? I have no pain during urination or ejaculation. I could see no traces of blood in my urine. This is something which I want to discuss with my doctor. But I'll suggest to get my blood sugar level checked and also discuss possible nerve issues.",

    "question": "I am a 27 year old male with an uncircumcised penis. I started noticing the following symptoms after being treated for UTI (bladder infection) some time around 01/23/20101. A slight tingling feeling just at the tip of urethra...it is on the inside and not on the surface.The feeling is like there is some urine stuck at the end...so it is a feeling like I have not emptied it completely2. It's like after I urinate it disappears and then returns after around 15-20 minutes, even though my bladder is empty at this point.3. I've noticed that tingling sensation is more obvious when I am in seated posture.4. Not sexually active5. Sort of comes ON & OFF. Usually is triggered (either ways) by masturbation.6. Consulted my family doctor. She noticed some irritation at the tip of urethra. She thinks its dermatitis inflammation of urethra. I am applying a cream twice in the affected area since past two days. Doctor also ran a test of my urine and could not find any traces of infection. My prostate was also checked and she said it felt normal.7. Its usually better in the morning and worsens as the day progress.8. Sensation is more obvious when I am in seated posture (doesn't mean its completely absent when I am standing)Right now I am peeing like once in 1.5 hours. My family does not have history of diabetes and I haven't noticed any other symptoms that are usually associated with diabetes (weight loss, extreme thirst and/or hunger). I'll be discussing this with my doctor when I have a follow up but I am feeling if it a nerve issue? Would appreciate a second opinion on this.Thanks in advance",
