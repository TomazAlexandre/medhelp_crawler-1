            "answer": "Gastroparesis would be unlikely with a negative gastric emptying scan.At this time, an upper endoscopy would further evaluate the upper digestive tract.The CT scan would make liver or gallbladder disease less likely.\u00a0\u00a0If the upper endoscopy is negative, you can consider more specialized tests like a 24-hr pH study ( to exclude GERD) or an esophageal motility study.These options can be discussed with your personal gastroenterologist, preferably at an academic medical center.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

It should great improvement, but it is not always sucessful for everybody and only last for about 6months before wearing off. My moms only lasted for about 3months. My mom lives off off hot tea's, toast, very little cereal. Before the injections my mom vomitted daily for hours at time.\u00a0\u00a0She cannot even tolerate the smell of food without being sick. Its very hard on her and the family not to be able to have holiday dinners or to go out to lunch. My mother also has Type 1 Diabetes, unfortunately this can be common for those who have diabetes. There is a world superior doctor at Temple University in Philly who specializes in mobility problems of the stomach. Maybe you could try there.",

    "question": "My husband is Type 1 Diabetes and is 58 years old. Had surgery for a fractured hip at the end of June. Used Vicodin following the surgery for two weeks. He completed using the pain meds in mid July; it is now about the beginning of October. Although his hip is healing and he is able to walk, he is unable to sleep since mid July. He complains about such great discomfort in his upper abdomen under his chest when he lies down, that he ends up walking our hall at night and only snatching a few minutes of sleep each night sitting straight up in a chair. He had a CT scan with barium and they found no obstructions or holes in his intestines. Recently he had a gastric emptying test in the morning, but the results are normal. Except in the mornings food is easier for him to deal with. The discomfort starts towards the end of the day. We have been trying smaller amounts of food and low fat diet.He also makes sure his bowel movements are regular by using Miralax. Reglan, Famotodine (pepcid), prilosec and antiacid pills do not work. He is steadily losing weight - although he was not overweight to begin with. He is no longer able to work as he can not focus on the issues at work. He is seeing a Gastroenterologist, but it is 4 weeks between appts. He is so frustrated and now depressed. Should we be seeing a different type of doctor? Is it possible that since he is able to digest OK in the morning, but not well in the afternoons - that the Gastric Emptying Test was incorrect? What other tests are there to assist us to find out what the cause is?",
