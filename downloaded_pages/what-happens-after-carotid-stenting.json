            "answer": "Persistent hypotension is common after carotid stenting, occurring in approximately 20% of patients. It is due to compression of the carotid bulb by the stent. While some studies have found that it is associated with more procedural adverse events and stroke, the long-term implications of it are less clear. The effect does tend to persist and stopping antihypertensive medications is appropriate.",

    "question": "My father, 77 (diabetes mellitus, auricular fibrillation, peripheric arteriopathy), had his left carotid stented nine days ago. His right carotid was 100% occluded (some TIA episodes a year ago), left was nearly 90%.I had heard that carotid stenting was a relatively rapid intervention, with a quick recovery. But it is not being the case. He feels weak and dizzy... I am specially worried about his blood pressure. Before the stenting, he was hypertense, but, after the sten,t blood pressure is low,with figures of 120/50, 110/50, 100/60. The doctors (vascular neurologists) seemed not to be very concerned about that: they put his antihypertensive drugs off. They also put diltiazem (prescribed by his cardiologist) off. But I wonder if this lower pressure is a transient effect, or if we can expect that this is going to continue... And, of course, I am worried about the risks of these changes in blood pressure.I thank youf very, very much in advance for your help.",
