    "question": "Almost 32 weeks on pregnancy #3. I think I'm in labor. Pregnancy #1 i delivered @ 37 weeks (full term) and #2 @ 39 weeks (also full term)I'm having intense contractions and i know that braxton hicks aren't supposed to hurt that bad. These are making me cry. Right now they're about 10 min apart. I can actually see the contractions in my abdomen when they happen. Also another thing is that sometimes it feels as if maybe the baby's limbs protrude through my cervix during contractions. It's very painful.I'm really scared that this is it and I'm only 32 weeks. I also have gestational diabetes. Any advice? Would anyone who has had premature birth share please? I'm losing my mind and I'm worried.\u00a0\u00a0I've decided to wait to go to the hospital until they're 4-5 min apart my water breaks or bleeding occurs. What can i do if anything?",
