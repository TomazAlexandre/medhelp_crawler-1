            "answer": "I'm no doctor, just a man who has read way too many articles on fitness and tested a few out. What I've found the best way to lose weight is to find your maintenance level (you can find a rough calculator online) that will tell you about how many calories you burn in an avg day. Subtract around 250 calories and you've found your ideal calorie amount! Keep in mind you should take exercise into account as well. You should be shooting around -2 lbs a week. Keep in mind at first (when you have excess weight) you'll lose weight very quickly, and as you get skinnier it gets a little harder. If you ever find yourself at a plateau, where you're not losing anymore weight just drop your calorie intake a little more. Its as simple as that! I strongly strongly STRONGLY advise you do some workouts (arms legs chest etc) while you're doing this. Cardio is completely optional, although since you have diabetes, running isn't a bad idea, just don't kill yourself with intensity. The important part is eat a little less than you burn everyday! But make sure you aren't starving yourself! That's just as bad! Stay in a good range!And water is godly. Water = less hungry + higher metabolism.",

            "answer": "Oh I almost forgot. It doesn't matter what you eat at all. If you really wanted to, you could be on an all ice cream diet and lose weight as long as you're eating less than you burn everyday. Of course i dont recomend that. Eating meats and vegies fill you up quickly and are full of vitamins. As long as you aren't eating a bunch of crap, you're all set! Yogurts, sandwhiches, lean meat, vegetables. All of it is good, and don't be afraid to eat carbs, just make sure you know how MUCH you're eating. Use this app to your advantage!",

            "answer": "The above comment, eat less than you burn, is about right.\u00a0\u00a0But calories isn't the way to get there.\u00a0\u00a0The amount of calories has little to do with weight -- how well and quickly you metabolize and digest foods is the more important factor.\u00a0\u00a0That's why, especially for a type 2 diabetic, avoiding simple carbs is the place to start.\u00a0\u00a0That means sugar, too much fruit, white flour and the like.\u00a0\u00a0These foods metabolize quickly to sugar and stored as fat if not immediately burned.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, fatty fish is high in calories but nobody gains weight on them because the fats are good for us and the body uses them well.\u00a0\u00a0Then are foods we just don't digest well -- dairy and wheat are two of the most common of these -- although yoghurt might be an exception here.\u00a0\u00a0We all have foods that just don't go through very well, so they stick around and don't get burned off.\u00a0\u00a0So starting with the basic principle to burn more than you consume, add in some knowledge about how foods are metabolized.\u00a0\u00a0If you need help with this holistic nutritionists can often be of help, and there are millions of books out there, though I'd advise you to take any prescribed diet and divide by two as far as truth is concerned.\u00a0\u00a0Also, the only good way to lose weight is slowly by changing to a diet you are going to follow for the rest of your life.\u00a0\u00a0Fad diets don't work in the long-term and can be unhealthy in the long-term as they can lack important nutrients.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
