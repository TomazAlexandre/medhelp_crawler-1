            "answer": "Hello,Number of conditions can lead to pain in the shin and edema in snkles and lower limbs. Diabetes is one of the most important cause.Pls get your blood sugar levels evaluated to rule out diabetes.It can be due to peripheral artery disease (PAD). In PAD, fatty deposits build up in the inner linings of the artery walls. These blockages restrict blood circulation, mainly in arteries leading to the kidneys, stomach, arms, legs and feet.This can cause pain and swelling in shin and ankles. Diagnosed by X-ray angiography and magnetic resonance imaging angiography (MRA).Another important condition causing this type of sensation is nerve compression. You may need tests like Nerve Conduction Velocity to find it out. Other possibilities are overweight,venous insufficiency (when the veins in your legs are unable to adequately pump blood back to the heart) ,heart failure, kidney failure, or liver failure and arthritis like gout or rheumatoid arthritis.I feel that a clinical evaluation and investigations are needed in confirming a diagnosis.Pls consult a physician/neurologist for the same.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Sounds neurological...The partial palsy in your face would be \"Bell's Palsy\", I think, and the causes of this are unknown, though several diseases are known to have Bell's Palsy as a symptom, such as Lyme Disease.I would definitely visit a neurologist to have the \"pins and needles\" feeling in your feet diagnosed, along with the pain in your legs. Visit a GP and have then do a CT scan on your legs from your adrenals to your feet, or something similar. Did you ever have any imaging done in this region after noticing the bump there, and then noticing it disappear? I'd guess that it ruptured, but you said it disappeared a few weeks before you experienced the acute onset of symptoms that sent you to the ER...which makes me wonder if that was just a sebaceous cyst. When it ruptured, it could've caused some nerve damage or other damage, though, so in any event, that area should be looked at.Edema in the lower extremities, including the ankles, is generally a result of poor blood flow (venous pooling, as kindd mentioned), and also, swollen lymph nodes in your groin area and other parts of your leg not allowing for the proper flow of blood. Imaging will show lymphadenopathy if it's happening, though, so definitely see a GP and a neurologist as soon as possible! Please monitor yourself carefully until you are able to see the doctor next and make sure your fever doesn't return...103 is fairly high and cause for concern, should it happen again.Good luck, and I hope you get well soon!",

    "question": "My pain started in April when I first noticed a small cyst like bump on my shine bone close to my ankle. It hurt when I walked. Two weeks later it went away. Then in June, I had this severe pain from my buttocks down the backs of my thigh, along with chills and 103 fever and was rushed to the ER. They thought that I had a blood clot, but the MRI showed nothing. And so I was discharged with having nothing but questions in my head. Since then, I have sever pain in my shin area and thigh area when I walk. My ankles will swell, and the bottoms of my feet hurt sometimes-like Im walking on needles. Last month, my whole left side of my face went numb for 2 days. What is going on with me!? Im terrified of not knowing and doctors arent telling me anything!",
