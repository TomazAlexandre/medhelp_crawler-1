            "answer": "Hi there!Well, the dietary intake should depend on the basic metabolic profile (height, weight, gender, BMR etc) and the physical activity. And it is difficult to comment specifically without knowing the relevant clinical details. While the calorie intake is important, it is also important how it is distributed in different food portions (carbohydrates, proteins, fat etc). I would suggest consulting a dietician/ nutritionist for charting an appropriate diet plan.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
