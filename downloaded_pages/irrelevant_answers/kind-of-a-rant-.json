    "question": "Okay...so I need encouraging words or advice or something...I am 37 weeks friday and I am so ready for my daughter to be here because I am beyond over being pregnant. It has been a very long and complicated pregnancy due to my Type 1 diabetes so I was high risk from day 1, we are both healthy I am happy to report, I have worked my *** off to make sure my baby girl is healthy and I am too but now all this stress is piling on at the end, I am HUGE!! I cannot sleep at night because I am either so ungodly uncomfortable or my thoughts are going crazy :( my fiance and I are not living together yet because of a bunch of crap that has happened (long story) we are trying to get a place together but nothing will be ready by the time the baby will be here..oh forgot to mention my doctor will induce me at 39 weeks if the baby doesnt come on her own, so roughly have two weeks left but I have been in a lot of pain lately with my back and cramps and sciatic nerve. SO I am ready to have my daughter but at the same time wish it wasnt happening yet because we arent prepared :(",
