            "answer": "I can understand a sticky clear discharge prior to urination and\u00a0\u00a0following sexual excitement that does not result in orgasm as the periurethral glands do secrete fluid that appears prior to orgasm. After urinating, I am at a loss to explain this as I would expect the urine to have dissolved this fluid. If you are a diabetic with poor sugar control, maybe you have a lot of glucose in your urine and that last drop is really urine not secretion.S.A.Liroff, M.D.",
