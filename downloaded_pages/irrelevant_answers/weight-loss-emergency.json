            "answer": "Wow, your family is cruel. I wish they knew how much they're aggravating the situation.This sudden weight gain sounds like it may be indicative of a disease or illness. Have you been to a doctor? Sometimes weight gain is a sign of something else that may be wrong.Assuming you're healthy, this may be due to getting to that age where you don't burn through calories as easily.There is only one way to lose and that's to cut down on what you eat. But this doesn't have to be a drastic thing. Not eating or starving yourself won't help things.Anyway, here are some tips:First, if you drink pop, try to cut down. There's a lot of empty calories in soda pop. You don't have to go cold turkey, but start by cutting out one can a day, then two, then three, until you're to the point of drinking only a couple cans a week. You can try switching to diet, but it's better to avoid it altogether if possible.Also, try cutting down on sweets. If you can, try to avoid all desert during weekdays. You may need to start by avoiding desert every other day, then increase it as you go. But give yourself some days off from this. I want you to lose weight but not torture yourself.Thirdly, make sure you're eating breakfast. Don't skip it!\u00a0\u00a0Most people who skip breakfast struggle with their weight. Eating breakfast, no matter what it is, is an easy way to help with weight loss.Make sure you're eating 3 square meals a day, with 2 snacks.Fourth, cut down on late night snacking. Again, don't go nuts here, just cut down.Try eating whole grains in place of white bread, pasta, bagels, etc. Start reading labels and aim for foods that are high in fiber and protein, but low in sodium, sugar, and fat. Aim for 10 grams of fiber for every meal.Don't cut out the fat completely. It's essential for brain development, and it also helps regulate the metabolism.Get plenty of calcium. Replace yellow cheeses (cheddar, colby) with white cheeses (mozzarella, swiss). Eat yogurt and lowfat cottage cheese and get your vegetables if you can stand eating them. (I have a tough time with vegetables. :))If this doesn't work, you may need to start counting calories. But try a more moderate approach first. You don't need to starve yourself or take drastic steps to lose. A few tweaks in your diet, maybe some light exercises like walking, and the weight may come off on its own.",

            "answer": "OytheGreat gave you some excellent advice; in addition, I'd strongly suggest that instead of taking food from your hand and not letting you eat, your mother should be taking you to the doctor to get tested for a couple of issues that can cause weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0The first one is thyroid function; you need to have TSH, Free T3, Free T4 and thyroid antibodies tested.\u00a0\u00a0 The second is insulin resistance, which is actually pre-diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0With insulin resistance, you make enough insulin, but your body doesn't utilize it. You need to have blood sugar and insulin levels tested.",
