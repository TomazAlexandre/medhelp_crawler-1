            "answer": "I have heard that cancer can run in a family like diabetes or anything else. But you neednt get it only because your mother or gran had it.And my friend went for pap smear and a few other tests before she planned for her baby because her mother is a cervical cancer survivor and her grandfather had some other cancer. I think such people should get regular medical check ups done.You have not mentioned it in your post as to why you need a pap smear. I think it is good if they find out detect early so that you get medical help asap. My 80 year old aunt (uncle's wife) is totally cured of ovarian cancer with 6 chimos and without surgery. Her symptoms were mistaken for a seasonal fever and thyoid in the beginning before they detected this.",

            "answer": "A lot of times when you get an abnormal pap they are misreads.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes people have precancerous cells (actually quite common apparently as 3 of my friends have had this) and they undergo a laser therapy to get rid of them.\u00a0\u00a0There are many other reasons that people have abnormal paps besides full cervical cancer.\u00a0\u00a0If your gyn knows about your family history, perhaps she might be willing to do a transvag ultrasound to rule out ovarian cancer?\u00a0\u00a0Might help for piece of mind.",
