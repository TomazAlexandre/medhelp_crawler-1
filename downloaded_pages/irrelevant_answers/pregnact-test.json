            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The best time is after missed period. So if you have missed your periods and have all these symptoms, take a pregnancy test, preferably from a morning sample, though any sample will do. If you have not missed your periods, then you can take a highly sensitive urine test or a blood pregnancy test about 3-4 days before the due date.If the test is negative and you continues to be so one week after missed period or if you do not miss periods then other causes will need to be looked at. If you are also over weight, check out for diabetes and hypothyroidism. Severe anemia and polycystic disease of the ovary too should be ruled out. Do consult a gynecologist. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
