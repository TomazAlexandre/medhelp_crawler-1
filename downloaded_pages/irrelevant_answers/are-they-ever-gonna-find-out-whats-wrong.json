            "answer": "did you have any other tests besides your TSH?\u00a0\u00a0If ANY thyroid levels come back abnormal there is something wrong! You said you had some MRI's done....Were you by any chance having dizzy spells? Aches, pains, loss of sensation in limbs or tingling sensations? These are all directly related to thyroid problems.\u00a0\u00a0It's good to know ahead of time if the endo you will be seeing specializes in thyroid dysfuntion...many specialize in diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Your endo may reccomend a biopsy for the growth, or he/she may start with just doing more thorough blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0TSH by itself doesn't tell you a whole lot, you need a FT3 and FT4 done with it to see the big picture, and even sometime TSI and antibodies tests.My advice to you is listen to your body and be your own advocate for your health!Good Luck!",
