            "answer": "First breathe... I am sure this is all very scary.\u00a0\u00a0I remember when the dr. told me I had GD.\u00a0\u00a0I was scared too.They are right 120 is where you want to stay below after meals.\u00a0\u00a0This number is much lower for you than it is for other diabetics because you are pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0The reason they recommend this number is for several reasons.You can develop complications like high blood pressure and high birth weight baby.\u00a0\u00a0You don't want to cause you or your baby stress, so stick to about 30 grams of carbohydrates or less per meal.\u00a0\u00a0(2 slices of bread).\u00a0\u00a0And stay away from candy and other sweats.The second problem is for your baby only.\u00a0\u00a0If your baby becomes accustomed to having a lot of sugars cross his/her system, thent he baby will have to make up for your body by producing extra insulin.\u00a0\u00a0The babies system will get used to making extra insulin and when he/she is born the babies blood sugar will bottom out.\u00a0\u00a0That's scary for you, baby and nurses.Bottom line, eat healthy, get light to moderate exercise and keep testing your glucose levels!Also, postpartum... have your dr. order another glucose test about 12 weeks after you deliver.\u00a0\u00a0They often fail to diagnose type II diabetes until several years later.\u00a0\u00a0GD can definately lead to it.\u00a0\u00a0Took me 6.5\u00a0\u00a0years after my son was born to realize I had type II now.\u00a0\u00a0It couldve been caught and under control a lot earlier.\u00a0\u00a0So stay on a good routine and stay on your dr!.",
