ALL of them warned about dizziness, light headedness, shakiness of the legs while standing, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I weigh 138.You can easily have your blood pressure checked, tho if you have it checked while anxious, it'll go sky high.

That will cause high blood pressure and diabetes.No worries about brain tumors, tho.\u00a0\u00a0 I've known a number of cancer patients who developed brain tumors and most were found by accident with no symptoms like you've described.Anxiety is a horrible thing.\u00a0\u00a0If you're like me, you wish you could just choose NOT to have it!Best of luck and work on that weight.

            "answer": "So sorry you feel so sick.Have you tried taking a magnesium supplement?\u00a0\u00a0Gelsemium deficiency and magnesium deficiency have very similar symptoms which include anxiety attacks, OCD, vertigo, spasms, cramps, a feeling like something caught in the throat, etc.You might try magnesium to start and if that doesn't help, try the gelsemium.\u00a0\u00a0Both at health food stores.\u00a0\u00a0Magnesium oxide is what is in the stores, but mag. glycinate or gluconate are much stronger and better.\u00a0\u00a0 Gelsemium is found in health food stores and also helps with stage fright.\u00a0\u00a0(side effect- flu preventative).\u00a0\u00a0:)",

            "answer": "Hi,I too suffer from OCD, anxiety, and other mental disorder's. Sometimes it takes years to find the right meds that will work well with you. I understand about obsessing over what could be wrong. But to me it doesnt sound like anything too serious. I would speak with whomever you get your meds from and find out if they need some fine-tuning or changed altogether.Hope this helps.",

    "question": "Some information about myself: I am a 21 year old male. I am obese. I have extreme OCD (diagnosed) and take 5 different medications.For about a week now I've felt kind of dizzy/lightheaded, it's not severe but just kind of annoying. Sometimes I'll feel a bit nauseous but only for a short amount of time. Sometimes I'll get a bit shaky. But as I said, none of it is severe, and them are really my only symptoms.Being diagnosed with OCD and Anxiety, obviously I'm very worried something is extremely wrong with me. (brain tumor? Low oxygen to the head? Diabetes? Bad blood pressure? Heart attack?). I'm scared I'm gonna go into a coma or something.If something was seriously wrong, or something seriously wrong was gonna happen, would I have severe symptoms + more symptoms which show something is wrong?Do these symptoms sound like something is seriously wrong, and do you think they will eventually go away on their own?",
