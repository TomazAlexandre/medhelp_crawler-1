            "answer": "If you have been on any antibiotics over the last few years at all - you could have triggered a candida infection. That is when normally in control yeast in your body goes out of control. It feeds on sugars you eat as well...On the other side, most people are also comsuming more and more Splenda which can cause a reaction you are describing...the candida and Splenda reactions won't always cause a visible rash but, cause itch. Lastly, I would talk to an allergist and see if they can test some common foods and environmental triggers on you...the candida is a simple stool test - the allergy testing is more costly and involved.\u00a0\u00a0Keep us posted!",
