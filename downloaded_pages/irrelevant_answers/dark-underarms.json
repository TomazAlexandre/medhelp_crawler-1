    "question": "I am a 16 yr old teen girl with dark underarms. Its darker than the rest of my body. I read it somewhere on the internet that chemical peels can lighten it to some extent..is it true? Is it safe for me to use it? I have tried lemon juice and all other home remedies but none have worked for me till now.. :( and as I am growing up I am starting to resent the fact that I cannot wear sleeveless like my other girlfriends.. please help!Oh and I did not use to have dark underarms. It started to develop when I was about 14. That was when I used to do shaving and use haircreams but I stopped immediately and haven't ever used since then. I don't use any kind of deodrants and perspirants. I wax my underarms now. I tried bleaching too but didn't work.",
