            "answer": "Were you fasting 12 hours before or not, that is the difference.A fasting blood sugar between 100 and 125 is considered the 'gray ' area of pre-diabetes. So not diabetes yet. Keep in mind this can change daily.There is a sugar load test usually performed in situations like yours. Lab in doc office (endo clinic) takes fasting blood sugar blood draw, then you drink a sugar loaded drink provided, wait two hours, then they take blood again to compare if your cells absorb sugar or if it floats around in the blood in high levels.If you dont put sweets in your house, then you cant really eat them. Time to cut back while your still young.I dont think anyone can say its because of your thyroid, but there are many cases where people have thyroid issues and diabetes, they are both autoimmune disorders.",
