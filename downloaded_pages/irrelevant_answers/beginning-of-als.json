            "answer": "Hello.These symptoms are not suggestive of ALS. In ALS, you get muscle weakness and twitches.Most probably, you have peripheral neuropathy. Generally diabetes, anemia, vitamin deficiency are the common causes. We need to rule them out. Have you consulted a neurologist?Regards",

Would the fasciculations show up before weakness or atrophy?\u00a0\u00a0And would they be spread throughout the body while seeming to be more consistent in the one particualr limb?",

            "answer": "Hello.While the presence of muscle fasciculation is necessary for a consideration of ALS, it is not sufficient for diagnosis. By the time a person has fasciculation, some weakness does become apparent on clinical examination, may not be observed otherwise. Fasciculation can be more in one part than the others.Once again, ALS is a motor neuron disease. Sensory symptoms are rare to occur. You may ask your doctors to assess you for ALS and rule it out. Please keep in mind the \"benign fasciculation syndrome\". While I don't say you do not have ALS, I feel your symptoms are not suggestive lf ALS.Regards",

    "question": "I've been experiencing some strange sensations lately that have me concerned.\u00a0\u00a0Sensations are sporadic, not constant and mostly in my lower left leg, but occasionally in my other leg and both forearms.\u00a0\u00a0I get a tingle that lasts for a couple of seconds maybe every now and then throughout the day.\u00a0\u00a0Again, it has been mostly in the lower portion of one leg, but once in a while elsewhere.\u00a0\u00a0I've even felt it in my cheek muscle in my face once or twice.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't noticed any weakness or any daily activities hindered aside from worrying about it constantly and my calf muscles being tender to the touch from time to time.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I've noticed an occasional warm, but not burning, sensation going from the top of the outside of my thigh going down the leg from time to time.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be the beginning of ALS or is this some sort of neuropathy? Or could it be something else? Any information would be greatly appreciated.",
