            "answer": "If you were infected by someone who has genotype 1, then yes you would also have the same genotype (and some people have more than one genotype, by the way). As far as whether you actually have HCV, if you've only been tested for HCV antibodies then you may not have it. Some people who get infected with HCV naturally clear the virus on their own (about 20% manage to pull this off). But they will still test positive for HCV antibodies, usually for a very long time after clearing the virus (for life usually). The only way to truly know if you are actively infected is to get an HCV RNA viral load test (known as a \"PCR\" test). You need to get that test completed, and if you are positive they will also determine your genotype.As far as the liver enzymes and other labwork, you can worry about that later. But first thing is to get the PCR and then go from there. And if you think you have HCV, STOP drinking alcohol (if you do drink).",

            "answer": "Hi WD.\u00a0\u00a0If you think you have Chronic Hep C, or if you know someone who does have it\u00a0\u00a0(and has geno 1) and you were exposed to their blood at some point in your life, and if you have been feeling like dog doo and now have elevated enzymes, you tell them to test you specifically to see if you have CHRONIC Hep C.\u00a0\u00a0I had a history of IV drug abuse (very well-documented) and acute hep in the 70s.\u00a0\u00a0 25 years later (and no drug abuse / alcohol since) and with a host of weird symptoms, thinking I had MS or diabetes or Lupus or a brain tumor, docs kept telling me my symptoms MUST be in my head because nothing was wrong with me.\u00a0\u00a0THen one day my enzymes went up to about 70 ish,and then it was\u00a0\u00a0\"uhhh...have you ever been tested for chronic hep C?\".\u00a0\u00a0If your docs won't do the test to see if you have chronic Hep C, is there a town / city anywhere closeby with a doc who will test you?\u00a0\u00a0You have the antibodies, your enzymes are now up some, and so - someone should test you.And yes, quit drinking indeed if you think you have it\u00a0\u00a0because they say drinking and Hep C makes it a lot worse.\u00a0\u00a0Also, if you smoke cigs - quit those too because they are bad for the liver with Hep C.\u00a0\u00a0I stopped drinking and drugging over 25 years ago\u00a0\u00a0(totally) but continued to smoke cigs heavily, and so it wasn't booze and Hep C that messed my liver up.\u00a0\u00a0I think it was decades of heavy cig smoking (my hepatologist agrees).\u00a0\u00a0I'm not THAT bad off\u00a0\u00a0(after 33 years of the virus I had Grade 3 Stage 2 in 2003).\u00a0\u00a0Not too good to have been booze free for 25 years, though, ya know?\u00a0\u00a0 Got any nicoderm patches I can borrow?\u00a0\u00a0 :)Best of luck to you.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you'll test negative.",

    "question": "If you get Hepatitis C from someone with geno 1 does that mean that you have geno 1? Does having just the antibodies give you symptoms, or if you have symptoms does that mean that you have a viral load? I have tested positive for Hep C and have many symptoms that some folks talk about on this forum. A year ago my AST was 67 and my ALT 94. On monday I got another blood test and should have it back this week, I live a long way from major townsand they will not test for viral load or ammonia levels or geo types up here, Ive had symptoms for years, thought it was diabetes and those tests kept coming back negative...any help?thanksBilly",
