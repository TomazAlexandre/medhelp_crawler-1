    "question": "I recently had some routine blood tests done. The Dr. did not seem concerned, but I noticed some abnormal results. I also have been having symptoms of: Bleeding gums, blurred vision, Dizziness, Fatigue, HeadacheSchizophrenia symptoms, Nosebleeds, Numbness in feet, Weightloss (50+ lbs in 7 mos), Joint, bone and back pain, Muscle pain, Weakness, Type 2 diabetes mostly controlled, Anemia, and Leg and foot cramps. I do have a referral to a rheumatologist the first week of November for the joint and muscle pain. What should I ask about at the rheum. - I'm beginning to think these may not be signs of just arthritis. Several years ago I was dx with Psoriatic Arthritis and took Sulfadine (something like that) Made me sick, and I never went back. Symptoms are getting worse. I'm 38 and female.Tests were as follows:Elevated AST/SGOT 38Low Albumin: 3Elevated Protein: 8.7Low Creatinine: 0.19Low BUN: 6High Neut: 68.1High MPV:\u00a0\u00a013.4Low MCH:\u00a0\u00a026.9elevated ESR: 55No Rheum.
