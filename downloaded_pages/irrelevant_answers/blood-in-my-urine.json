            "answer": "Hi. I'm a male who had blood in his urine a couple of years ago. The way doctors work is to check for and eliminate the possible causes of your symptom. If you still have blood in your urine, they'll test for urinary tract\u00a0\u00a0infections, kidney stones, std, etc. until they can narrow down the specific cause. Since there are so may possible causes, it won't do you any good to worry till they do more tests and know something for sure.\u00a0\u00a0And sometimes, if you read through theses posts, it gets frustrating when they say: we don't know.",

            "answer": "Hi, thanks for your response, i did end up going to the dr's yesterday, I had severe back pain, they tested my urine, it still had blood and keroteins in it, or maybe ketoteins? Anyhow, they are suspecting kidney stones, I have a CT scan today, and they will get to the bottom of this. I have no UTI, or other infections. So we'll see.",

    "question": "I am not sure what this means. My old doctor's ended up calling me last week, the lady was kind of rude and asked why I hadn't been in to retest my urine. I was confused and asked her to explain. When I went in last month to a diabetes test, I don't have it by the way, they found blood in my urine. She said didn't anyone tell you, I was like No. I went through a whole month without knowing that, hince why I switched doctors.So what does it mean to have blood in the urine? I am also having low back problems, it's hurting when I pee now, I have some groin pain, and I just feel blah. My husband thinks it could be my kidneys, but I've had these issues before, and my old doctors refused to test me for kidney infections because I was too young. I am 30 years old. I go to the doctors tomorrow to get my urine retested, and have been worried about it since my old doctor's office called me. Any help or ideas would be fine, has this happened to anyone else before???",
