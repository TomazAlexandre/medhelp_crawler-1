            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Extreme fatigue could be due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems. Another possibility is sleep disturbances (like sleep apnea, imbalance of rapid eye and non rapid eye movement sleep etc.). You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, low Vit b12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium. Hyperthyroidism too causes increased sweating and tiredness.\u00a0\u00a0 A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper investigations and referral. Take care!",

    "question": "For a week have been really tired, am followed by a Internal Med MD, felt really tired yesterday so went home from work at 3pm, went straight to bed but was restless, kept dozing on and off thinking I was dying. Post getting up, didn't feel as bad, but was standing at the sink, I felt a strange spasm, tingling, and burning type sensation starting below the umbilicus radiating upward extending thru the chest area and both arms, but stopping at the neck. Woke up again today very tired, I am having no GI symptoms, chest discomfort, BP and Blood Sugar is good. I am an RN. Just have never felt or heard of this strange sensation.",
