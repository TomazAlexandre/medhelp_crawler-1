    "question": "Hey Everybody!I am 36.2 wks pregnant and last week my doctor tols me I had to go for a sono because the baby might be getting too big. I went for the sono this morning and the baby is 7.14lbs and 20\" long. The doctor is sending me for the 3 hr glucose tolerance test because even though my glucose test at 26 wks was normal he is concerned I might have diabetes now. I am really worried because he said the baby might have high levels of sugar if I am diabetic now. Has anyone had a big baby and normal glucose levels???",
