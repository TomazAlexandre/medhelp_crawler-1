            "answer": "Certain disorders such as diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus,and Addison's disease can increase the excretion of urine and thereby lead to dehydration.Because people with Type 2 Diabetes produce some Insulin, ketoacidosis does not usually develop. However, the blood sugar levels can become extremely high (often exceeding 1,000 mg/dL). Such high levels often happen as the result of some superimposed stress, such as an infection or drug use. When the blood sugar levels get very high, the person may develop severe dehydration, which may lead to mental confusion, drowsiness, and seizures, a condition called nonketotic hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar coma.Carol",

    "question": "my dad was first diagnosed with diabetes (non-insulin kind) then he got congestive heart failure (where they put him on lasix) then just last month on the 23rd, he went to insulin. at first all went smoothly. but all of a sudden he began to experince lower abdominal pain/cramping, diahrea and vomitting. we took him back into the v.a. because even if it was just the flu, he couldnt be givin his insulin because he couldnt keep his food down, nor his many other meds. they sent him home that night, saying there was blood in his urine (a 10, what does that mean?) and that he was dehydrated. he takes orlistat to help him lose weight, but on this particular day he couldnt go at all. and he wasnt urinating more than was normal. mom has been making him drink tons of water. he has chills and feels cold, but no fever and no sweating. 4 days later he is back in v.a. with severe dehydration, but he hasnt thrown up since that night, still no sweating, drinking tons, no diahrea....what other things could be causing the dehydration?...oh yeah, his heart and liver seem fine, his dr is considering his kidneys, but the v.a. emergency team didnt seem interested in the kidneys at all...and would dehydration cause speech difficulties?",
