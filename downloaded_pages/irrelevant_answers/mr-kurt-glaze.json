            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Extreme fatigue could be due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems.If you are also over weight, check out for diabetes and hypothyroidism. In women polycystic disease of the ovary too should be ruled out as it causes insulin resistance and fatigue. Low estrogen and menopause can also be a cause in women.Another possibility is sleep disturbances. You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out.Subclinical urinary tract infection should be ruled out. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, poor sleep patterns, inadequate sleep, low Vit b12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium. Hyperthyroidism too causes increased sweating and tiredness.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
