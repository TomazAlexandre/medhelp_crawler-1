            "answer": "Look into candida yeast overgrowth symptoms. This could likely be your problem. Candida overgrowth will make you feel hungry for no apparent reason. Especially for carbohydrates. The toxins that candida releases will make you feel fatigued, lightheaded, hungry and more. The worse the overgrowth the worse your symptoms will become. If you have ever taken antibiotics or have a weakened immune system from some type of illness then candida is a likely possibility. You can find information about this condition if you look up candida forums on the internet.",
