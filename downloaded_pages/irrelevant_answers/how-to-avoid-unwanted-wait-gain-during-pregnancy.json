            "answer": "Hi there!Found some informtion onlime for youer question. Hope it helps.This may sound very contoversial but gaining weight during pregnancy is actually recommended for both you and your baby...the healthy weight gain is between one and a half and two punds.Much more than this and you are gaining extra fat, which is not necessary and will prove difficult to lose afterwards. A simple way to check whether your weight gain in pregnancy is fat or baby is to measure the tops of your thighs throughout the pregnancy. If the tape measure reading is constant, then it is baby who is growing, not you.Top tips from an online source -* Avoid excessive sugary or fatty foods as these contain empty calories and, although tasty, don't help keep your weight stable.* Eat lots of fruit and vegetables with lean meat or fish.* Remember that potatoes and bread are not fattening until you put butter on them.* Brown or wholemeal bread is more filling than the white variety, as is brown rice compared to white.* Alcoholic drinks are best avoided as they are not recommended for either mother-to-be or baby - fruit juice with sparkling mineral water as a good alternative.* If you feel an attack of the nibbles coming on, opt for dried fruit and a glass of water, this will help fill you up and avoid constipation, which is a common side effect of pregnancy.The odd 'sin' will do you and your baby no harm whatsoever, but try and keep a balance in your eating. Don't forget the benefits of regular exercise for a healthy pregnancy and your previous unwanted weight gain should not reoccur.Please let us know how you get on or if you need any help with any otther questions you may have...we are always happy to help you!",

    "question": "if a woman 5'3, weighs around 190+ pounds and she gets pregnant, how can she avoid gaining extra weight other than what is expected. i'm kinda in this situation but i'm still not sure if i am pregnant or not. i would still like to know either way it goes for futur reference. also, diabetes runs in my family on both my mom and dad side so i know i'm going to have to watch what i eat and keep a diet healthy enough for a growing baby. i really don't want to gain more weight than i have to b/c it's goin to be really hard for me to lose and it's not good for me b/c of my family health history. any suggestions (on diet & exercise) from women with similar body types that got pregnant would be great. thanks! :o)",
