    "question": "I had about 8 shots of espresso for cramming for exams. I experienced the normal caffeine crash and then later the next day, I decided to get a pizza. About an hour after eating the pizza, I checked my sugar to see if it was low (i got a meter to check for suspected hypoglycemia). The reading was 297. This was back in october. I checked frequently to make sure everything was ok. It peaked at 150 a few times but nothing more. Then a week ago, I had a peak reading of 207. Then it went back to normal. Could the high reading be caused by caffeine or the aftereffects of it?",
