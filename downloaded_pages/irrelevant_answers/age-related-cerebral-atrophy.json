            "answer": "Age-related cerebral atrophy may be seen on CT scan or MRI study of the brain as a variant of normal aging. Thus, it is not necessarily a disease, but a condition. It may or may not represent the prodrome for a disease. Minimizing risk factors for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and stroke may be helpful.
