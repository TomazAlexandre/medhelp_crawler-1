            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I am sorry to hear about this sudden development and yes, this can be scary. The cause could be anything from stroke to spinal cord injury to viral infection to hemorrhage. What is required is a MRI of the brain and upper spinal cord and a spinal tap to reach a diagnosis. A complete work up to exclude high BP, diabetes etc should be done. Please discuss with your neurologist.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

During my stay I returned from unconciouness realizing I couldn't move from the neck down, released to see my primary dr., sent to a neurologist and still at a loss for answers. It is day 5 and I have gained movement in my fingers/hands and limited movement in arms. I can barely move my toes. My calves remain swolen.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone interested to help with answers or even common experience?",
