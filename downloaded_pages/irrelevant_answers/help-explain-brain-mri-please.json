Thought I had a lot of symptoms like MS, but not sure the mri would suggest that? sleep apnea. \"Multiple foci of bright signal are seen on FLAIR & T2 in the cerebral white matter. These are more prominent in the deep white matter including the corona radiata & centrum semiovale bilaterally with foci measuring up to 8mm. A prominent focus seen in the white matter of the right inferior frontal gyrus. Somewhat confluent foci are seen in the left corona radiata anteriorly. Other scattered foci are seen in the subcortical white matter in the frontal & parietal lobes. No cortical infarction is identified.There is patchy increased signal on FLAIR and T2 in the mid pons bilaterally, a bit more on the left.There is no abnormal increased susceptibility in the brain parenchyma in the gradient echo sequence.The visualized intracranial flow voids are within normal limits in appearance. Theres no hydrocephalus.There is minor mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cellsImpression:Multiple foci of bright signal on FLAIR & T2 in the cerebral white matter as described. Similar patchy foci are seen in the pons bilaterally. This is nonspecific & somewhat prominent for this patients age. The appearance may be related to chronic small vessel ischemic change. Is there a history of hypertension or diabetes? The possibility of demyelination cannot be excluded. Lyme disease could be considered.Clinical correlation recommended. Followup MRI may be helpful.
