Diabetes mellitus, vitamin B12 ,vitamin B 6 defficiency,chronic kidney disease,hypothyroidism,Lyme\u2019s disease,fibromyalgia,vasculitis,sarcoidosis are few\u00a0\u00a0common possibilities. Diabetes is the commonest cause. Get your blood sugar done. If it is normal then you may need additional tests like electromyography, nerve conduction tests, tests of blood, urine, and/or spinal fluid etc. Vitamin levels can be checked with a simple blood test. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information you have provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
