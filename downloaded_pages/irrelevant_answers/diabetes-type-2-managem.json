            "answer": "There is no doctor on this board, only other people with diabetes. To give some input to your question though:I'm assuming your mother is recently diagnosed. She should have a glucose meter and begin taking her blood sugar on a regular basis. She should take her fasting blood sugar that should ideally be under 100. She should also try testing two hours after various meals. She wants that blood sugar to be under 140. If it is higher then that suggests she can't eat that particular food or can't eat that amount. What is important in diet is to cut as much as possible the amount of carbs she eats. Carbs include such things as sweets of course, but also bread, rice, cereal, pasta and potatoes. Every diabetic is different. Some diabetics find whole grains are better for their blood sugar than white. For some of us it makes no difference. The only way to know is to test.Comfortable shoes are important especially if she walks a lot, because exercise is very good for type 2 diabetes, as is weight loss if she is overweight.As for tests or exams. All diabetics should get a dilated eye exam, once a year, as high blood sugars can lead to eye damage. Also her doctor should look at her feet because if she develops neuropathy she might lose feeling in her feet and not know if she has a sore which could be dangerous. Type 2 diabetics should take good care of their teeth as they may develop gum infections.Hope this helps.",
