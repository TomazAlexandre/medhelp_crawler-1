            "answer": "Hello,your insulin dose needs to be adjusted to lower your blood sugars.Your doctor should have explained to you how to do this.What dose are you taking.\u00a0\u00a0Are you taking a mixed insulin or basal (long acting - as background) / bolus (short acting - to be taken before meals)Typically insulin dose will be increased by 2 - 5 units (5 units if you are very far from target, and 2 units, if you are close), with blood sugar being observed.\u00a0\u00a0Ideally this is done under supervision from your health care provided or a certified diabetes educator.Would recommend the book \"Think Like a Pancreas\", \"Using Insulin\" by John Walsh, or Diabetes Solutions by Dr. Richard Bernstein.\u00a0\u00a0All describe how to safely adjust insulin doses.Please also combine your metformin and insulin with a lower carb, moderate protein, and high healthy fats diet.\u00a0\u00a0Regular exercise will also help.",
