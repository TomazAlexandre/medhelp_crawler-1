            "answer": "Hello again,Good question....Visit the link below and you can search for more information using the term Edmonton protocol.http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=6354This procedure has not been perfected and from what I understand, patients who have undergone this procedure have to take a lot of immunosupressive drugs that could have possible side effects.I really do not have a lot of insight and knowledge as far as the scientific / medical side of all of the research being done and your question is a very good one.\u00a0\u00a0One would think that beta cells could be taken from a non-diabetic's pancreas, but ultimately, the CURE has to be better than the disease itself.Please do search \"Edmonton protocol\"",

            "answer": "Acba,I'm another volunteer and a long-time diabetic.One reason that \"just putting in good cells\" doesn't work for us is that the destruction of beta cells is the SYMPTOM of our underlying auto-immune dysfunction.\u00a0\u00a0Our systems would simply destroy the new beta cells they find.The reseasrch into curing diabetes is so complex, in part, becuase there're a lotta things going on in our bodies, beyond our need to supplement with insulin.\u00a0\u00a0I'm convinced that the path to a cure will result from an integration of many research paths ... and that I'll get to hear that a cure has been found in my lifetime (I'm 50 now).JDRF is aimed at Accelerating the Cure ... Just yesterday I was told that the goal is to condense 25 years of research into the next 5 years.\u00a0\u00a0If everyone with diabetes gave just $10 when the Walk for a Cure is in their area, we'd raise $160,000,000 this year... probably 5 years could be shrunk to 4 years.\u00a0\u00a0If we all got our pals to donate $10, too ...",
