    "question": "My sister has had type 1 diabetes for 15 years. She is 25 years old, and her blood sugar levels have been very high in the last year. The average is often in the high 200's -mid 300's. She does have some stress currently, in vet tech school, but it seems her insulin is not working. She calculates it according to what she's eaten, and how she was taught, but some times it goes down fast. Other times, she can eat practically nothing, and it is high. When it is cold, it goes down very quick, but she catches it before it goes too low. How can you stabilize it without the sugar levels being a yo- yo, really high, or really low? Is insulin resistance a factor in this?",
