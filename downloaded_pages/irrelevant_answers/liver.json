            "answer": "I forgot to ask two more questions in my above post. Is swimming in a chlorine pool ok with high liver enzymes as stated above, or will the chlorine elevate them more? my husband & I just purchased a pool and PCP said it's ok to swim in Chlorine. However, I'm skeptical in doing so. Also, my other question is, If it's the lipitor (generic) or metformin that's causing my high liver enzymes and I've been off of them, shouldn't my levels be returning to normal instead of climbing each time I am tested?I\u00a0\u00a0would like to thank you for all you do. This is a great forum to get experts advice and help ease one's mind when scared and confused.",

            "answer": "I'm so so sorry for all these questions. I'm trying to get them all in, so that I can get all my answers at once and not have to keep bothering you. I was just reading about Autoimmune Hepatitis and the\u00a0\u00a0the major auto-antibodies are called anti-liver-kidney microsomal-1 antibodies. Which then reminded me, that I was also diagnosed with Hypothyroid/Hashimoto's thyroiditis due to having a low tsh level in March 2012 along with anti-microsomal level of 599 and it should'nt be higher than 34. Please do tell me, this isn't the same thing as the anti-liver-kidney microsomal-1 antibodies? I would also like to mention after reading your forum, that I do not drink alcohol at all. However, I do drink alot of coffee. One more question, if a fatty liver from 2008 is the cause of my high liver enzymes and I'm not scheduled to see a gastro. until Oct. will more damage occur? I received a letter from my PCP in regards to my ultrasound I just had done last week, stating it was normal. I will be picking up the radiologist report to review on Thursday. I'm surprised if the one in 2008 showed a fatty liver, now this one is normal. Not that I'm not ecstatic.I have lost 10 lbs. in a wk. in a half due to stress over this issue and changing eating habits to try and cleanse my liver, not being able to take my diabetes med.'s and cholesterol medicine. I monitor my sugar and it's been excellent. However, not sure as to what my cholesterol, trig. are at this time. Praying they're always in range. Keep up the good work. I say prayers every night and thank GOD for giving all Dr.'s healing hands and the knowledge in helping the sick. Keep up the good work. GOD BLESS YOU!!",

            "answer": "Thank you for the quick response. I greatly appreciate it. I'm ecstatic to beable to go into our new pool, also for exercise seeing that I pulled a muscle in my groin walking the treadmill.\u00a0\u00a0My fear of waiting till Oct. to see a gastro is that severe damage will happen to my liver in the meantime, until I get treatment. I picked up my ultrasound report and if you could please explain what all this means?Abdominal Ultrasound-Limited:Comparsion is made to the previous study of 8/28/081.\u00a0\u00a0Diffuse fatty infiltration of the hepatic parenchyma.2.\u00a0\u00a0The gallbladder, pancreas, intra and extra hepatic biliary ducts, right kidney, aorta, inferior vena cava and common iliac arteries are normal.IMPRESSION:Fatty liver. The gallbladder is normal.I'm now waiting for more bloodtest results from yesterday.Would you recommend a gastro. or a\u00a0\u00a0Hepatologist?I have a procedure next Tuesday to remove a sebaceous cyst, I've read that a antibiotic is usually prescribed after to prevent infection. I've also read that antibiotic's aren't good to take with high liver enzymes. Would you recommend I reschedule the procedure for now? or would it be ok to take the antibiotic?Not sure when I can resume taking Ibuprofen again for headaches, pulled groin muscle, ect. Please advise?My PCP, he took me off the metformin and lipitor at this time thinking it's the med's that are causing the high liver enzymes. However, if they are the underlying cause, wouldn't the level's of went back down as time went on and not up?I know this sounds like a weird question, but was wondering what your advice would be in coloring my hair? because of the toxins in hair dyeAlso, would you recommend taking vitamin E and if so, what dosage?Would it be ok to finish painting in my house?Could untreated Hashimoto's and my high antibodies may have anything to do with my high liver enzymes?",

    "question": "Dr. Schiano,Well, I'll start with telling you a little about my health. I've type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high trig. (hereditary on mother's side). I was just diagnosed with Hashimoto Thyroiditis. Due to the diabetes and high cholesterol I was taking metformin 500 mg.'s once a day and lipitor 10 mg.'s once a day for about 6 yrs. now. I've now been taken off the medicine's now due to high liver enzymes. I was diagnosed with a fatty liver in 2008. I feel like I'm falling apart, the unknown is the worse. Anyhow, I just had a ultrasound done on my liver, pancreas, aorta and right kidney due to high liver enzymes. I had a attack about 4 yrs. ago with pain under my left breast that radiated around my left side in my back and shoulder area. Never did find out why. However, since that attack, I've to take beano before eating veggies and gas-x at times, or I've a discomfort. Unfortunately, I never did receive a diagnose as to what happened. Ok, so now, I will list my high liver enzymes:3/24/12- Alanine Aminotransferase 59 U/L High 0-557/5/12-AspartateAminotransferase57 U/L High 5-347/5/12-Alanine Aminotransferase 100 Repeated/Ver\u00a0\u00a0U/LHigh 0-557/11/12-Aspartate 60 U/L High 5-34AminotransferaseAlanine Aminotransferase 114 Repeated/Ver\u00a0\u00a0U/LHigh 0-557/19/2012-AspartateAminotransferase56 U/L High 5-34Alanine Aminotransferase 118 Repeated/Ver\u00a0\u00a0U/LHigh 0-55Ok, so I'm told it's probably from the generic of lipitor, per the pharmacist the generic has the same ingredients as lipitor. She doesn't agree. Anyhow, I'm thinking the same because I've been off the lipitor since 7/6/12, and my enzymes are still climbing expect -AspartateAminotransferase did drop a little still not in normal range. Could the cause of my liver enzymes be because of the Hashi's? if so, is it dangerous to have high liver enzymes for a long period of time? I'm scheduled to see a gastro & Endocrinologist in Oct. but am afraid if something serious, it could be to late.",
