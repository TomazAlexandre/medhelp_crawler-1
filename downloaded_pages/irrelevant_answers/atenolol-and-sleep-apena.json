            "answer": "unksoldr,Thanks for the post.Beta blockers block a receptor in the bosy that has effects in numerous organ systems. One common complaint is that people often feel tired on these drugs, but some have the opposite effects. Beta blockers can also effect glucose metabolism in the body and increase sugar levels.These side effects are counterbalanced by a definite benefit in mortality seen with beta blockers (and ACE inhibitors) in patients after MI, this effect is probably independant of the blood pressure effects of these drugs.As physicians it is important to balance the benefits of risks of different medications in each patient. You should discuss your regimen with your physican and your concerns over these side effects.good luck",

    "question": "I'm a VA patient and if lucky I see my doctor every 6 months. I had a mild MI 3 years ago, which I believe was more related to the fact I had the flu and was doing a rather frustrating job outside in the snow in zero degree weather.(I was living in Fairbanks Alaska) Testing over the years since have shown no damage to my heart, no blockages and a 75% EF. I have had 3 cardiolite stress tests and reached 101% on the last one. (I'm a cyclist since the 70's) I have been on atenolol every since even though I didn't have high BP before the MI, after my last visit to the VA doc I stopped the atenolol(25mg). My BP at home was averaging 110/70 so I wanted to see if my BP would remain in the normal range without it. While in the hospital I was diagnosed with sleep apena, at first the BPAP helped but over the 3 years I had slipped back to sleeping 10-12 hours without feeling rested and during the day I had no energy at all. 2 days after and since quitting the atenolol I started sleeping 8-9 hours and waking up feeling great. However, my BP started to creep up so I started taking 5mg of lisionpril which I had also stopped taking several months earlier due to BP's of 90/60 which had me feeling very light-headed. The lisionpril has brought my BP back down to 120/80. After several months on atenolol my fasting blood sugar got up to 128 so I was put on metformin and Avandia. My last HcA1 was 6.0 and I have also lost about 35 lbs since the MI.1. Is disordered sleep a side effect of Atenolol?2. Does atenolol raise blood sugar levels?",
