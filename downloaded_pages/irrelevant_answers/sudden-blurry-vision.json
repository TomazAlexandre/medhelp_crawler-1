    "question": "I have had blurry vision for over two years now and not one doctor can figure me out! On October 1, 2007 I was moving and all of sudden my vision went blurry. I would like to note that since that day my vision has been blurry 24/7. I can never see clear nor does anything help to improve it. On that day I did have over 600 mg of caffeine and did not eat very much. 8 months prior I did have walking pneumonia as well. I have never had spouts of blurry vision other than the occasional dizziness from going on a long runs or working long hours. The only health problem I have had is Crohn's Disease. My family history is Mother: Ulcer Colitis and Dad: has a Pace Maker. With that said my other symptoms that I am having are fatigue, trouble concentrating, trouble speaking, trouble standing for any period of time, sweat at night, rapid heart beat at night, burning in my eyes and sensitivity to light. These are the following tests I have had done...MRI - Only thing found was white spotsVisual Evoked Potential Test - Was negativeChest Xray - Nothing was foundTilt Table - WAS POSITIVEThese were the things that were tested through my bloodTSH, T4,T3, Basic Thyroid function, Diabetes test and common blood tests that are routine to see if basic levels are off. - All of these were fine.I also have low blood pressure 90/60I have quit my job and am unable to do alot. This is so frustrating I have seen an Endocrinologist, Rheumatologist, Ophamologist and a Neurologist. Along with seeing my Internal Med doctor for navigation.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I need another opinion or even a point in the right direction. I find it hard to believe that I am unsolved I am seeing some of the best doctors and no one has an answer.... HELP!",
