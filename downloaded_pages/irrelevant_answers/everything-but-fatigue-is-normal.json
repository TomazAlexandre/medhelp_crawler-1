            "answer": "Hi, I'd say I think the same as you. Are there any other risk factors, such as family history, that make the PCP concerned? Is the node still growing?Did your scans show a \"fatty hilum\"? How is your LDH?I recall one study that went something like this: of 100 patients with nodes that would not go down, 4 or 5 were sent for biopsy and 2 had cancer. So the odds are in your favor, with whatever is causing the node swelling also causing the fatigue.A PET might be better to do than a biopsy, to check the intestines etc. But a biopsy would set your mind completely at ease, if it's negative.",

            "answer": "Hi Ken,My PCP wanted a PET but insurance said \"no\". Big shock there right???I am having the biopsy done on the 19th. THe medical field is enough to make you crazy for sure ....Oh, my cholesterol is awful. I had pancreatic surgery and the surgery caused the diabetes and I am having trouble getting under control. What would LDL have to do with it? THere was no mention of \" fatty hilum\".",

            "answer": "I'd guess that your situation with reduced insulin production is therefore somewhat similar to type 1 (inherited) diabetes. Since high LDL with diabetes is a bad combination, I'd look into all the work being done with using very restrictive diets to control both. Offhand, I don't know of how diabetes would cause higher LDL - but if it were me I'd want to know if I had the more dangerous \"small dense\" LDL.Good luck tomorrow with the biopsy.",

    "question": "Hello everyone,I am new here and I have a few questions please. Everyone sounds like they have a lot of experience and knowledge to share.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a swollen lymph node on the right side of my neck for 4 months it has grown from 1.2 cm to 2.4. I am feeling no pain, i have not been sick with any flu, cold or virus for at least 6 years.I had mono when i was in 8th grade ( now 57). I have fatigue ( a lot ) and nauseated at times. I have not lost any weight and have no other symptoms . I have had a CT and ultrsound done and both came back neg just showing the lymph nodes which i have a many of on both sides on neck but only 1 enlarged one.My PCP wants a biopsy done. Oh, and my blood work is fine. With the tests fine and the increased fatigue, could this be lymphoma? I guess I am looking for more symptoms. Any thoughts on this ??? Thanks in advance.",
