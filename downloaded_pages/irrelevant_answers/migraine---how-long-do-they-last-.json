            "answer": "You could definitely be experiencing menstrual migraines. However, if they're lasting as long as 5 days, it might be time to consult a doc about the headache.Another thing to keep in mind, which you might want to mention to your doc when you see them, is that, if the pain is worse in the morning, there's a possibility that you have sleep apnea (sp?) and that it's the oxygen deprivation to your brain during your sleeping hours that its causing SOME of the pain. Maybe a sleep study would be in order to check and see.Good luck and keep us posted,~Dame",

            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Are you still experiencing your headache? It can indeed be hormonal in nature but it can also be in combination with other headache types. In particular, cluster headaches develop during sleep and may last for several hours. Attacks occur every day for weeks and even months, then disappear for a certain time. If your tablets does not help that much, prescription medications such as\u00a0\u00a0vasoconstrictors and anti-inflammatory drugs before and during menstrual period may help. Check with your doctor about this. Take care and do keep us posted.",

You may be experiencing perimenopause wherein you feel the symptoms of menopause early on and the hormones go haywire. Do keep us posted with your blood test results. Wishing you the best!

I wondering now if it's cluster headaches ?not sure what causes these ? I thought it was a hormonal thing but i'm not so sure now.Been to my gp yesterday, they have prescribed me 80mg Propranolol Hydrochloride.Not 100% sure what these are but i have been told they will help. Been referred to a Neourologist so hopefully will get to the bottom on this. I've decided to keep a heahache diary so i can take it a long with me when i get my appointment. My pain is still in the left side of my head, my necks stiff but bearable. forehead tender. and pain in the back of my head. i would describe it as a dull ache with presure around the head. Starting to feel it'll never end feel very down at the moment, I'm desperate to get back to work as i want to get back to a normal routine. i go away on the 23rd May i'm praying i'll be ok for then. I really don't want to be ill on my holidays. Can you give me anymore advice ? any would be deeply appreciated. thanks Rowena, knowing i can get intouch with you for support as really helped ! thanks so much xxxx",

            "answer": "Hi Carol,I hope you are feeling better now. Are you stressed all the time? Dull pain and pressure around the head more aptly describes tension headaches, another type of primary headache. This also presents with tightness of scalp or neck and the degree of severity remains constant. Emotional stress and sometimes hidden depression are contributory. I mentioned previously that these primary types of headache may sometimes overlap. But it is difficult to comment beyond this point and it would really help that you check with your neurologist for direct evaluation. With regards to the stomach upsets, can you describe the pain? Gastric ulcers in particular are usually exacerbated with food intake. A history of heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), skipping of meals, stress and use of medications like NSAIDs (non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs) are usually the cause.\u00a0\u00a0 Diabetes symptoms, on the other hand,\u00a0\u00a0usually include polyphagia, polydipsia and polyuria (increased water intake, increased food intake and urinary frequency).\u00a0\u00a0And it may not be directly associated with your symptoms. Hang on and try to relax. We will soon get to the bottom of this. Take care.",

            "answer": "Hi,It is good to know that the optician cleared you with any eye problem. Although if the pupil problem recurs, an eye doctor will help rule out and manage any eye conditions. Being weak can be due to many possible causes including your inability to eat well due to your\u00a0\u00a0stomach upsets. Try to eat small meals several times a day and drink plenty of fluids to prevent this. Over- the-counter antacids may also help prevent acid build up. Glad to be of help in any way I can.
