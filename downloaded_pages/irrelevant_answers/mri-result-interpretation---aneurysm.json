            "answer": "Hi!In general it is a normal MRI. The tiny saccular aneurysm would be a chance finding, and unlikely to be the cause of any symptoms for which you are being investigated for. The same holds true for white signal intensity on T2 and flair. A single intensity may not indicate anything. Multiple such intensities are found in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or Wilson's Disease, migraine headaches, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. However, please discuss this report with your neurologist. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I experience frequent migraine attacks lately. One time when the migraine attacked, I tried to sleep to somehow ease the pain. However, When I woke up at dawn I was surprised that my left eye could not see. What I just saw with my left eye was complete darkness. It lasted for 2 to 3 minutes. Thus, I decided to undergo MRI of my brain with MRA with contrast and below is the findings:\\\\Negative for restricted diffusion. Small focus of t2 weighted and flair bright signal is noted in the right frontal lobe, gray-white matter differentiation is preserved. No abnormal parenchymal nor meningeal enhancement. No discrete mass noted. There is no evidence of discrete vascular malformation or aneurysm. Midline structures are in place. The ventricles are normal in size and configuration. The sulci and cisterns are not affected. The stellar/juxtasellar, pineal region, cerebellum-pontine angle, craniovertebral junction are unremarkable. The cerebellum and brainstem are intact. Intracranial angiography shows adequate visualization of the anterior , posterior cerebral, anterior communicating, posterior communicating, and middle cerebral arteries. There is tiny suspicious saccular outpouching in the a1 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery. No discrete aneurysm or tangle of vessels in the rest of the vessels. The rural sinuses are patent. The para nasal sinuses included nasopharyngeal and orbits and tympanum astounds are intact. \\Impression: \\1. Nonspecific focus of solitary white matter bright signal right frontal lobe\\2. Consider tiny aneurysm in the a1 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery\\3. No acute hemorrhage, infarct or mass lesion.\\\\May I know the meaning of the above mentioned findings?\\Thank you and hope to hear from you soon.}",
