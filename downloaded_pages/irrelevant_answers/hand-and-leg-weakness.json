            "answer": "Thank you very much for your question; although it is quite hard for me to give you a precise opinion here without being able to examine you, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern. From your description of symptoms, it appears that you have the feeling of physical tiredness (fatigue) that is related to a cause such as excessive effort in the sports activity. It could be possible that you had similar physical strength earlier, but presently it is essential to evaluate the possibilities of underlying diseases such as anemia, diabetes, nutritional deficiency, infections since they can decline the normal physical efforts. In addition it is also essential to evaluate that if you are suffering from any other symptoms such as night sweats, weight change, breathing difficulties and excessive thirst. Essentially, you need to insure that you lead a healthy life. This means a good diet, exercise (limited not excessive) and plenty of sleep. If you suffer continuous weakness and notice reduced strength of muscle bulk in hands and legs, please arrange an appointment with a doctor right away. Hope this helps. Take Care & Stay Healthy!!!",

            "answer": "Thanks for your reply. Well after googling about symptoms of anemia and diabetes i am sure of not having those. About nutritional deficiency and infection i don't know how 2 know about that. And i don't feel reduced muscle strength on both legs and hands.. Its just that i start too feel weaker after climbing few steps. Since i am overweight i would come to know if my legs are not supporting and same goes to hands. Also i don't have night sweats, no weight change, no breathing difficulties and no excessive thirst. Hope i am not suffering from anything serious. Also i would like to know.. If i am tired i.e physically tired.. Then how much time does it require to recover. Also the climate over here is cool.",

            "answer": "It sounds that you have temporary fatigue due to your excessive physical efforts in sports activity. It will\u00a0\u00a0be best that you don't over-exert for the period of time since body has own limitations in strength. Additionally, keep your nutrition high by taking minerals & protein rich diet and take sufficient sleep. If this doesn't resolve your health concern then consult a doctor for further assessment and advice. Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your replay again. I have one last question, I mentioned before about the weakness in my fingers. I wanted to know its reason. I dont have numbness, pain on my fingers. I am not able to straighten my small finger without providing it a extra bit of muscle strength. All my fingers are straight when they are away from each other but when i bring them close my smaller finger bends to some angle. It happens on both the hand. Though the degree of bending on left hand is more than right hand. Also i feel weak when pulling stuffs near me through finger and picking up items. This problem started with the pain and weakness on legs. Though my condition on legs has improved a lot.. the weakness on fingers has improved very very less. Can this be also caused due to fatigue? Well its been a weak now.. So should i wait more or do i need to go to a doctor? And if i wait do you think it will get better? Thanks in advance.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Yes, if the fatigue is severe and if there is any electrolytic (minerals) imbalance, you may experience generalized body weakness. In addition, as your sport activity is badminton that requires a quite tight grip of hands for long hours so that may be the leading cause of your pain in fingers/hand. As your leg symptoms are improving, I recommend you to please avoid over-exertion in your game for a period of time till your other fatigue symptoms subsides. Take Care & Regards.",

    "question": "Hi.Its been a week before it started. I was playing badminton for 2hrs after which i felt weakness in my legs. I continued playing for more 2hrs the next day and The next day i could feel my fingers in both of the hands weak.. Its like i cannot use the normal power to do certain activities. I had a lot of pain in my calf which has reduced now. I still have a bit of difficulty in walking(feeling of weakness). I can't climb a lot of stairs. Though i sometimes feel my condition has improved.. i am sure it hasn't worsen. I am not sure\u00a0\u00a0what is causing it.. Can it be due to excessive play.. or any other problem. I don't drink a lot of water can it be a problem??",
