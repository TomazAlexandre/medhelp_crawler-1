            "answer": "Hi I have the same fear!! Its a test to see how your body breaks down sugars, as in pregnancy your blood cells dont absorb insulin properly so your body isnt breaking down the sugars properly! When I was in last week for my check up they tested my urine and it had sugar traces but the nurse told me it might just have been what I had had for breakfast (an orange, a banana, 2slices of toast and tea with a tsp sugar) as its high in carbs! So I also have to have the test done! But I am worried I have it although I wasnt ever over weight and I have no family history of it! So fingers crossed!",

            "answer": "For me, they took a blood sample when I first got there, then had to drink what tasted as warm gas-less orange soda in 5 minutes and then wait 1 hour to get more blood taken out and then another hour and got last blood sample. The drink is hard to swallow quickly because it is too sweet and you drink it on an empty stomach. And then they scare you by telling you if you throw up you'll have to come back and take test again. But thank God I didnt.I took my glucose test the morning after Christmas so I had a lot of sugar the night before (Starbucks hot chocolate, honey baked ham, apple cider, pie, etc) so my lab result said I was 1 number higher than whats normal. So I had to go again but this time they just took some blood once and that was it. The nurse had told me not to drink sodas, juices or other sugary drinks and foods the day before test so that my blood test would come out ok, and it did.",

            "answer": "The glucose test is a standard test for every pregnancy. When you're scheduled for it be sure to check how long they want you to fast before it.\u00a0\u00a0Some labs will allow you to have breakfast (nothing sugary of course) but some labs don't want you eating anything after midnight before the test. :-)",
