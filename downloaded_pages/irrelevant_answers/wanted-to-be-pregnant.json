            "answer": "I can completly relate! I am 25 and have been married to my husband for 5 yrs. We have been trying for 3 years now for a baby! Before I even knew about the diabetes thing my ob said she considered putting me on metformin. She said it helps your body use it's hormones but in the end she decided against it. Said I should loose some weight first. about 3 weeks ago I found out that I have type 2 daibetes. and the doctor put me on metformin. I have lost 10 lbs. With enough luck I will hopefully get pg soon. My family and I think that maybe a reason for not being able to concieve was because of my high blood sugar. So that could also be the reason for your problems. I definatly need to add you as a friend. It will be nice to know someone who is going through the same thing as me. And I mean that in a good way, sometimes i can be bad at wording things. Like I can be there to help you through this and we could work on this thing together.\u00a0\u00a0Wow I will stop rambling now, sorry. So ya it will happen... the metformin will help and loosing weight and getting yoru sugars to normal will help too. :D So cheer up!",
