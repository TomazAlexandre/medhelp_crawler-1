            "answer": "Hi,There are several possibilities, but overall I think you should have your thyroid rechecked soon(thyroid dysfunction can contribute to glucose abnormalities), and speak with your doctor about starting on another diabetes medication. Your numbers are not critical but you should reach the 200mg/dL level and not plan on going back on medications. You may have a transient GI illness causing some of this(you mentioned some frequent trips to the bathroom) but I think you should jump on it quickly before it gets out of hand.You did\u00a0\u00a0a fantastic job getting control through weight loss etc, but you may need a little extra help right now.Take care",

            "answer": "Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0After my initial panic my numbers have fallen back into range with a range of 75 to 114 and even a 35 after not taking the Fortament for over a day.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure what you mean by \"Your numbers are not critical but you should reach the 200mg/dL level\" and I presuming that the word \"not\" was left out (\"you should not reach\").\u00a0\u00a0We were actually trying to figure out if I had a GI illness that was causing the problem or if the Fortament was causing the GI problems as I think it did when I first started it.I appreciate your help.",

    "question": "Diagnosed as a Type II about 2 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0Placed on Fortamet, which was halved in dosage and then cut out as due to low glucose readings being common.\u00a0\u00a0Adjusted my diet and lost 20 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0H1bc last year was under 6 with no meds.\u00a0\u00a0This year doctor forgot to order and I am due to go back in about a month.\u00a0\u00a0Found in the past thatI seem to have rebound.\u00a0\u00a0Wake halfway through the night and test generally 100 +/- 10.\u00a0\u00a0Eat a snack at that point, generally raisins, remains so when I wake up later: if I do not it rises considerably.\u00a0\u00a0Same problem between lunch and dinner.\u00a0\u00a0We tend to live out of sync.\u00a0\u00a0We go to bed around 4 am and get up at 11 am.\u00a0\u00a0We do not eat breakfast as it it is already time for lunch, which is eaten at around 1 pm.\u00a0\u00a0(Husband takes meds that require a wait before eating.)\u00a0\u00a0Dinner is at 8, with a substantial snack to replace the 3rd meal (about 60 carbs) about 2 hours before bed.The past 3 days everything is wacky.\u00a0\u00a0If I eat the normal way I do my glucose goes up.\u00a0\u00a0If I don't eat my glucose goes up.\u00a0\u00a0I have had 3 readings over 200, which I have never approached before.\u00a0\u00a0I would have considered 160 high before.\u00a0\u00a0I still have the last bottle of my medication in the house and started taking it again, but it does not seem to help much.\u00a0\u00a0This morning at 8 am I was 112, two hours later without eating I was up to 147, two hours after lunch and med it was 165.\u00a0\u00a0I have also found that I am experiencing stomach discomfort with resulting trips to the bathroom.At the visit 2 months ago blood showed that I had slightly lowered thyroid which will be retested at upcoming test.\u00a0\u00a0In an effort to control this without meds I have eliminated soy, corn, broccoli, and spinach from my diet.\u00a0\u00a0I ran out of tea, normally drunk daily, 3 days ago just before this started, but cannot believe that is the cause of all this.I hope you can help me.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.Mff",
