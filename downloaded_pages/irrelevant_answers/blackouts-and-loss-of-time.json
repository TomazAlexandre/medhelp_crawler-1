Her mother has chromes disease so she spends a lot of time at home with my daughter.. I was just informed by her mother that my daughter has been BLACKING OUT, not passing out, and when she comes to shes lost time and can't remember what has happened, it happened on her way to school the other day and she walked into traffic, thank god nothing happened and she is safe, but it's getting worse and im worried that she is going to hurt herself one of these times it happens.. My family history is complicated my brother has neurofromatosis and a shunt in his head and my mother has diabetes, I am healthy as can be.. I know her mother has chromes disease but besides that im not sure about her history much.. She has been to see a few drs but they can't seem to figure out whats wrong with her.
