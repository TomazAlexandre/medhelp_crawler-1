            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You should consult an eye specialist for this. Warm compress, topical antibiotics and good person hygiene usually does the trick. Soak cotton balls in warm water to give warm compress. Avoid touching eyes and apply a local antibiotic.Stye or hordeolum as it is medically called could be recurrent due to diabetes, recurrent touching of eye, poor hygiene, immunoglobulin M (IgM) deficiency, dry eyes, and chronic infection of eyelids.
