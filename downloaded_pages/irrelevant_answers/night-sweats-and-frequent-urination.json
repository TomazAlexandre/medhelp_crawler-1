            "answer": "Hello bookgard,Night sweating could be related to infections, anxiety, and diabetes. The only way is to get tested. If you are sexually active and have been in a non-monogamous relationship. I would start getting tested for all STDs. Secondly diabetes may causes frequent urination and night sweats. Third an unbalanced hormones can be some of your symptons.Take care!",

            "answer": "Kehdi22 gave some good advice. One other thing that can cause this that I know of is a bladder infection.Tests as Kehdi22 said are needed. This could be a problem that could get worse if not treated, it's probably time to see your doctor. It is possible that you can be treated and not need sleep medication to get that rest you need. Also, unless there is a health issue you do not know of, or we don't know of, drinking more water in the day could help.I hope you and kimmitiger get better.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Please consult a doctor to rule out diabetes, thyroid problem, adrenal gland problems, hypertrophy of prostrate gland (if you are male 65 years old). But since you are on estrogen replacement, I think you are probably female 65 years. In which case also get FSH, LH, estrogen and progesterone levels checked.It can also be UTI, but less likely if you do not get any symptoms during the day. Other causes include AIDS, cancer, infections in the body and side effect of certain drugs. It can also be due to severe acidity with H pylori infection and gastric reflux, hypoglycemia, carcinoid syndromes, and sleep disorders. At times cause cannot be found out.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",
