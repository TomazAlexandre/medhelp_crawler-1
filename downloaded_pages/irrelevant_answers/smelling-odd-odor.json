            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Generally bad odor is due to infection. Strong fruity odor is due to uncontrolled diabetes. It can also be a trapped smell in nose if you have nasal polyps or tumors trapping the air there. Thyroid related disorders too cause smell disorders. An abnormal perception of smell could also be the cause.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "for months now I have been smelling this odd odor that can be described as: combination of: sweet, clove like, smoke, musty odor. I smell it on my skin, through my nostrils, on my clothes. However, no one else smells it. This odor will itensify when I work out or just when it's hot. At time it even feels as a burning senation in my nostrills.This is driving me carzy! Now I did hear that some medication will cause these symptoms and in fact, about a year ago my doctor changed my cholesterol medication from Lipitor to Crestor. I discussed this with my doctor, he has no answers for me but suggested that I get off the Cresotr for 2 months and see if my symptoms will go away. If not, we'll have investigate this further.Does any one out there have the same symptomes? and if so, do you know what is causing this.Thanks,",
