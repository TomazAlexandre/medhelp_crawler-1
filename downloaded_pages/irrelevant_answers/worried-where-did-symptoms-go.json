I remember you also from when I was on the forum in 2008, I'm so happy you got your BFP!Yeah the only thing I had going for me was the sore bbs, and now that is practically gone. I hope it is just something that comes in waves and nothing to worry about. It took so long to get pregnant, so I am so worried every step of the way. I wish I could just relax, but there are so many unknowns.Wow, so we will be due around the same time together! I'm due July 4-5th.Thanks for the reply!",
