            "answer": "Hello,The natural course of diabetes is to progress over time, s many people start out with one medication but then need more eventually as their own insulin production slows in Type 2 diabetes. Many folks are not able to stay on only one medication for a long time, so although you have done your very best in controlling diet etc, your situation is not very uncommon. It is good your doctor checked antibodies. Did you also check a C-peptide level? This will tell you how much insulin your body is producing on its own, and give some gauge of how well you can respond to oral medications(which all need some degree of your own insulin present/capacity to work).Hope this helps explain things. Keep up your own good work and do not be discouraged.Take care",

    "question": "I was diagnosed as T2 about 2 years ago and began controlling by diet. Every 2-4 months, the disease has worsened and each time we change or increase the meds. I am 55. At the next increase, I am nearing the limit of metformin dosage and the last dosage implementation lasted only 70 days.I am not and never have been obese, have 100/60 blood pressure, exercise 5 days a week (for the last 10 years) and have healthy cholesterol levels. I have a number of food allergies and control my diet very stringently. No history of T1 or T2 in my family.\u00a0\u00a0I had my Dr. test for antibodies about a year ago and all were negative.So, why is my diabetes worsening against this evidence?! I expect to start insulin in less than 12 months at this rate. Any thoughts, explainations, similar experiences or wise medical observations would be greatly valued.",
