            "answer": "Replace magnesium supplements with K2 MK-7 (far more important co-factor for Vitamin D3).Magnesium will rise on its own as your Vitamin D levels rise (and I suspect other vitamins will too).As for Iron... to my knowledge, Iron helps carry oxygen in the blood which in turn oxygenates the cells and body in general.This is a good thing since it heavily impacts the immune system in a positive way (numerous bacteria - such as gram negative ones - cannot survive in oxygenated environment at all... so I would surmise this could be of great benefit keeping the body disease free, plus Iron deficiency is a recognized problem in the world - which of course doesn't mean you should overdo with it - I suggest that 18mg once per day, or every other day for a month [if you are deficient] would be enough to bring levels back up in the healthy range).I suggest you check this study:http://www.coaching-for-health.net/eisenzentrum/AM3_e.pdfAlso...\u00a0\u00a0ferrous fumarate seems to be one of the best forms of Iron in terms of absorption and being gentle on the stomach (its recommended to apparently take it 1 hour prior to meals).But if you are taking an antibiotic, then suggested waiting time for ingesting supplements would be about 2 or 3 hours BEFORE OR AFTER you have taken the antibiotic.",
