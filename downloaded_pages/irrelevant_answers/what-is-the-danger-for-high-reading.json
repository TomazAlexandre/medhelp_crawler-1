            "answer": "Did you test 2 hrs after you ate?\u00a0\u00a0Do they have you on a diet counting your carbs protein and fat?\u00a0\u00a0Depending on how high your sugar hoes it could just cause your baby to be larger and this can cause problems at birth including low blood sugar. If it goes too high it can cause problems for both you and your baby. If it is over the range your dr gave you I suggest you contact them.My meter reads in mg/dl. I'm assuming yours is using different units.One thing to be prepared for is they will test your baby's blood sugar frequently while you are in the hospital to make sure it's blood sugar is not going low.I have been through this process once with my daughter and am now going through it again with my little boy who will arrive in April. The diet gets difficult through the holidays but I promise you it is well worth it. My husband tells me how I am doing so great on this diet and he doesn't realize. I dont really have a choice because I want my baby to be healthy. Wish I could think that way when I'm not pregnant.Good luck to you and your little one.",

    "question": "I have been briefed about the danger of high blood sugar but want to know what others have been told or experienced here. So what is the danger to babies and my health if blood sugars are elevated...I have been doing pretty well overall wit the gestational diabetes and insulin etc but after breakfast my blood was 11.2. it was perfect first thing in morning and sky rocketed after breakie and all I ate was raisin bran,an apple and tbs of peanut butter. Could it be due to stress and anxiety, which i am sure make hormones a bit messed.....Any thoughts about this...Thnaks",
