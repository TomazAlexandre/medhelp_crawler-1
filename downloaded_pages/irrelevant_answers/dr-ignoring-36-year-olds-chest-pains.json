            "answer": "You have the right to all of his records. Go to all of the Cardiologists hospital etc and sign releases and get the records. Then take them to a Electrophysiologist maybe again at Duke if you are in NC. Then ask them to do a consult to look at the records and come up with a diagnosis and treatment. Many times when we talk to doctors they do not get the full story and they surely as Dr. McWilliams has said are not good communicators. You do need a further opinion. Sometimes it takes just getting everything in one place so that you can have it evaluated.\u00a0\u00a0Some of the info you have expressed seem contradictaory when you express it so having hard copies on paper the medical data will get someones attention.

    "question": "5 years ago by chance they found out my husbands pulmonary artery was enlarged.\u00a0\u00a0They done test after test and could not find a cause.\u00a0\u00a0So they referred him to Duke.\u00a0\u00a0We went there and had a heart cath put in and it came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0The cardiologist thought that maybe My husband had cushions syndrome and referred him to a endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0That test came back negative and he was released from that doctor as well.\u00a0\u00a0Still no answers.A couple years later he went to work and started feeling \"funny\"\u00a0\u00a0His coworkers found him laying on the pavement in the parking lot.\u00a0\u00a0 He had tried to stand up and collapsed and was shaking.\u00a0\u00a0I called 911 and they came and took him to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0They found nothing!They sent him home with a monitor for a month and twice a nurse called concerned about what the monitor was saying, but the doctor told us the results were fine.By this point we are getting irritated!\u00a0\u00a0Another 6 months goes by and he goes to the ER for his arm and once again they admit him for his heart.\u00a0\u00a03 days still no answers.6 months ago he started having chest pains.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor stated all the moniters and equipment are telling them he is in heart failure and they want to observe him overnight.... we stay and the next day they let him discharge him once again.\u00a0\u00a0We asked the doctor what is going on and all he states is nothing to worry about right now.... when do we worry about it?\u00a0\u00a0How do I get answers with out bankrupting us? What do I need to be looking for?\u00a0\u00a0should my husband even be working?\u00a0\u00a0What do I need to say to his Doctors?some of the alarms he sets off are pvc acv apnea and defib what do these mean?",
