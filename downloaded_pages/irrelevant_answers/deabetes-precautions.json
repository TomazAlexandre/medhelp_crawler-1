            "answer": "He has to check with his doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes you can control diabetes without medicines.\u00a0\u00a0I am on metformin even though I can control my blood sugar with diet because metformin helps with weight loss, and I need to lose a lot of weight.\u00a0\u00a0If it wasn't for the weight issue, my doctor would probably not have me on any medications since I am strict on my carb intake and diet.\u00a0\u00a0I absolutely have no sweets and switched to sprouted grain bread (no flour and has a low GI) and high fiber carbs which are better for your blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0I gave up sweets, junk food, crackers/cookies/chips, ice cream for the most part with an occasional indulgance of 1/2 cup serving, and gave up rice and have only whole grain pasta.\u00a0\u00a0So, if he's serious like that, maybe he can avoid the medication entirely.\u00a0\u00a0But, you have to run everything by the doctors.\u00a0\u00a0Only they can figure out with you what to do.",
