            "answer": "You saw a Diabetes Specialist.He just doesn't want to admit his lack of experience, or turn down the fee for your office call.Move on. There are thyroid specialists out there.Half of them can't tie their own shoes.The other half are worth having a medical conversation with.Place your bet, and roll the dice.But look at your tests yourself.",

            "answer": "I had awful symptoms with a TSH of 4.6 which is lower than yours. The first endo I saw told me I was imaging half my symptoms and if I'd listened to him I'd have collapsed by now as so much else happened afterwards. I now have a really nice endo who is really trying to help. So if you feel better on the treatment, go for it. Good luck.",

            "answer": "Love your song Peg -I have sung a few harsher ones.\u00a0\u00a0LOLI think your doctor may be brained fogged a little - Adrenals??? Does he know their purpose??\u00a0\u00a0Goof!!Keep in mind - with all the ups and downs I read and know about myself - TSH levels ( THAT MAINTAIN THERE FOR SOME TIME) are good usually around .5 and 1.5I took that down a bit from the 1.0 - 1.5. for personal reasonsI believe I function much better on the low end - I am at a 0.04 - This is where I was at in 2003 when Dx's with Graves.I am no where near symptomatically what I was then- I feel really good now - I believe I was in adrenal fatigue along with the Grave's and that is why I felt so aweful then.Now that I have supported them and repair is happening - my TSH belongs on the low end for me to feel well.",

    "question": "I called that endo specialist to find out what my TSH is. Remember he is the one that says adrenaline is not produce in the adrenal glands? yeah, that one.I had become hyper due to increase in armour. TSH is now 0.2, He says I do not even need thyroid treatment, as my levels were not that bad to start with.My TSH was 5.82, not as high as some others I have seen, but still above the limits and totally syptomatic. Needless to say, that has not helped with my stess and anxiety levels this afternoon. I think I will go back to my GP. At least she is willing to prescribe my armour for me.This is one of those things that I will be spending my evening relinquising to the Lord, as it is something I cannot control.Thanks for listening and allowing me to get this irritation off my chest.Peggy",
