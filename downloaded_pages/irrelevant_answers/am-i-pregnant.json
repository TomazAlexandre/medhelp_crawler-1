            "answer": "Hi, there are a few reasons you may be missing your period.\u00a0\u00a0When I was in my early 20's I started a very overzealous exercise and diet regime and lost weight quickly then kept it off, i did not have a period for nearly 2 years! Have you recently lost a lot of weight? Other things that apparently can cause it (besides pregnancy) are extreme stress or anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0Some other more unlikely causes I found when I was trying to figure out what was going on with me were uterine or cervical infections or certain chronic diseases and conditions such as lupus, and diabetes. Rarely, tumors of the pituitary gland or problems with the adrenal gland cause amenorrhea (loss of period).\u00a0\u00a0If you were pregnant you would be around 10 weeks, you would expect a home pregnancy test to pick up the level of\u00a0\u00a0HCG you had in your system by then, but as the above post expresses stranger things have happened!\u00a0\u00a0I hope you get the outcome you are wanting.",
