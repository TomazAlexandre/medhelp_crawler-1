            "answer": "Hello,Petechiae are pinpoint-sized red dots under the surface of the skin. They are common after skin trauma and viral infections. They should go away in a few days. But if they persist then please consult a physician and get other causes ruled out which include allergic reaction, autoimmune diseases, thrombocytopenia, ITP or leukemias. Also get your kidneys and heart status evaluated by means of kidney function tests and EKG, ECHO.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Hello,The normal range for WBC count is 4,300 to 10,800 cells per cubic millimeter (cmm) or 4.3 to 10.8 x 109 cells per liter. Leukocytosis or high WBC count may be caused by several conditions including bacterial infection, inflammation, leukemia, trauma, or stress. So we need to rule out all these conditions.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "Recently I have noticed some dark black marks on the soles of my feet. My Dr. has diagnosed petechiae but has no idea what has caused it. I have type II diabetes and a very sore ileostomy. I understand petechiae on the soles of your feet is rare. Can you tell me what has caused this? and what do I need to do about it? My feet have been swollen and are painful to walk on.",
