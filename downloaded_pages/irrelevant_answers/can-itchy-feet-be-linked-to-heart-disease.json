            "answer": "i was better for a while but now my itch has come back with a vengeance since the weather got hotter. I now stay awake almost all night and keep immersing my feet every hour to control the itch. Have seen two dermatologists; one suggested dermatitis without paying much attention to my symptoms, which are feet getting itchy all over as they become hot. The second one said it's a rare disease called erythromelalgia and that i just have to live with it and keep immersing my feet in water to cool them down. I finally called a dr. friend who's a neuro physician. He is ordering some blood work which will include sugar, thyroid, vitamin b12 and some other tests. He thinks its some sort of nerve dysfunction. My itchy feet are just driving me nuts!!!!",
