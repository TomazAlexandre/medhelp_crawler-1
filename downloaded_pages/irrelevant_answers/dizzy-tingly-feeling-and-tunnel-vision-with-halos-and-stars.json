            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, it can be focal seizures or retinal migraines. What is very apparent is that you must get a complete eye checkup by an eye specialist and not just by an optometrist. This loss of vision in the peripheral visual field can be due to optic nerve damage caused by glaucoma, high internal eye pressure, retinal detachment, occlusion of blood supply as in eye stroke, optic neuritis, and optic nerve edema. Tunnel vision is also possible after a history of head injury, concussion, brain damage and stroke, though all these causes may not be applicable in your case.Well smoking, high far sightedness, retinitis pigmentosa, air pollution, heavy alcohol consumption and glaucoma should also be looked into apart from diabetes as a cause for halo vision.All symptoms put together point towards hypoglycemia, transient ischemic attacks, migraines, or focal seizures.Please consult a neurologist and an eye specialist. It could be that your other symptoms are due to anxiety but eye symptoms need to be checked. Take care!",
