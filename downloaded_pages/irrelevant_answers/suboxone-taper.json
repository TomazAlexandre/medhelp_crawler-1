I've never heard anyone else express a fear of having to take this medication for the rest of my life. I've tried to taper down once & it was BAD! It seems the longer you are on it, the harder it is to get off it. Is that correct?I'm sorry to hear you are having similar issues. I feel your pain & wouldn't wish it on anyone. I hope you are doing a bit better since your original post. Hang in there, you are not alone. (Hope that helps!)",

What are your WD symptoms? When I tried to taper off the 1st time I didn't sleep for a month. On top of the pain and no energy, I had restless leg syndrome from he11.I hope to hear you have gotten better! Good job getting off of sub!!!! That's not an easy thing to do!!!",

If I could talk to someone's who's successfully rid themselves of\u00a0\u00a0this drug after taking it for @ least 5 years, i would actually go through with the pain and mental abuse knowing this night mare can end.

I have had 7 close friends overdose and die from heroin and about 10 more people that I know pretty well that have also overdosed and died. I have cone to terms that I have a disease called \"addiction.\"\u00a0\u00a0I read a great article that totally made sense to me about a year ago. It was about other diseases that you have to take medication for. Take diabetes for example. If you have diabetes you are not going to stop taking your medicine for it because it will make you much worse and most likely even kill you. This is no different than having a bad addiction to opioids. I have taken suboxone for 11 1/2 years and for the first year and s half I tried to get off of it and relapsed several times. Once I decided to try to stay on some suboxone and not taper off I have not even had a thought of using for just over 10 years now. So you can look at this is a couple ways. You can be a person which is not me and go off of something and never go back, or you can take medication for your diseases and have a fighting chance to stay alive. I just now want to go fisht either the government or the maker of this medication to make it affordable to people so they can have an experience like mine. I have been fortunate enough to stay clean, get good health insurance that would pay a good amount so I could afford my suboxone because if I didn't there would be no way I could afford $800 per month to stay on this medication. If anyone happens to know anyone I could talk to about my personal story and life on suboxone and possibly find the right people to talk\u00a0\u00a0to to make it affordable so we don't have so many deaths and people who want to get on this that cannot afford it.
