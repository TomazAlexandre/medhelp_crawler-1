    "question": "Im not sure if i need a orthopeadic or just a general doctor consultation. About 3 weeks ago I began having exteme pain and uncomfortableness in my leg, and the knee area feels swollen and heavy but not noticible by looking at it just alittle. sometimes its a shooting pain that will go all the way down to my foot and othertimes its a constant ache. normally when i wake up in the morning it all feels alot better but by the early evening it gradually gets worse. any exercise will start up the pain as well as certain movements like when my dog pulls on her leash. I woke up this morning and my ankle was a lil swollen and very stiff (i have had a fracture on this ankle that i never let heal correctly)\u00a0\u00a0I dont know if this is a muscle or vein or something else but its only getting worse.Im hoping someone will recognize these symptoms and be able to head me in the correct direction. Im currently unemployed no insurance, barely getting by on un employment so money is a BIG problem. Any advice as to where to start or a reasonable price doctor would be VERY GREATLY appreciated. thanks",
