            "answer": "My labs show basal insulin 39 mU/L (6 - 22) and 2 hours after drinking glucose (glucose tolerance test) insulin was 184 mU/L (15 - 65). My cause was eating too much refined sugar but worsened by prolonged hyperthyroidism.Excerpt from Women To Women: What Is Insulin Resistance?...\"Why all the concern about insulin resistance?Over 80 million Americans suffer from insulin resistance, and it appears to sit at the center of a web of related health problems. Women who are insulin resistant are at much greater risk of obesity, diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), heart disease, high cholesterol, breast cancer and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). There is some evidence that insulin resistance may contribute to endometrial cancer. It has also been implicated in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.Insulin resistance often accompanies the most common complaints we hear at Women to Women \u2014fatigue and weight gain. As women approach menopause, they become increasingly intolerant of carbohydrates and find it easier to gain weight, especially around their waists. Afternoon blahs, sugar crashes and carbohydrate cravings may all be early insulin resistance symptoms.\"",

            "answer": "Well, the funny thing is about that exerpt, is that the right diet for this is a whole plant base diet that is high in carbohydrates and plenty of plants and fruits. But it is no meat or oils. Which does make you lose weight. You can reverse type II diabetes According to Dr. McDougall, without exception. Maybe you should read his info on www.drmcdougall.com and see what you think and/or read the Starch Solution especially the section about type II diabetes. Also, the DVD Forks Over Knives is Fantastic. It can be purchased or is it on streaming if you have Netflix. It has lots of scientific evidence to back it up.I hope this helps.mkh9",

            "answer": "Dr Attia talks about carb intolerance...\"Remember, I was one of those doctors in the mainstream once upon a time.\u00a0\u00a0While I always tried (and hopefully succeeded most of the time) to treat overweight patients with respect, I silently judged them.\u00a0\u00a0Why can\u2019t you just eat less and exercise more?\u00a0\u00a0Only when I realized, despite my diet which rigorously adhered to formal recommendations and my 3 to 4 hours of exercise per day, that even I was getting too fat for comfort, did I begin to question the Conventional Wisdom of why we get fat.Of course, not everyone (fortunately) was born with my level of genetic susceptibility to insulin resistance (stated another way, not everyone is born with my level of carbohydrate sensitivity).\u00a0\u00a0In my experience, about 10-20% of the population (my lucky wife included) seem resistant to carbohydrates and maintain exquisite insulin sensitivity, almost independent of diet.Roughly 30-40% of the population are, conversely, very sensitive to carbohydrates and appear to be quite insulin resistant until nearly the last gram of sugar and most carbohydrates are removed from their diets.\u00a0\u00a0Then there is the rest of population, which includes me.\u00a0\u00a0To varying degrees, we\u2019re somewhere between these two groups.\"",

So do you have to stay from all carbs or just refined carbs and only take in limited whole grains? Sounds like you have a very strict diet.
