            "answer": "I am terrified. Please help!My doctor just confirmed my diagnosis as Thrush.I have been tested as HIV negative (well beyond the testing window) and Diabetes negative. I have not had any sexual intercourse since being tested.I asked my doctor what was causing the sores on my tongue over a month ago. He told me it was due to my geographic tongue. I tried to explain that I had never had geographic symptoms on the SIDES of my tongue - he didn't listen.I recent went through a course of anti-biotics which made the \"sores\" worse.Now my doctor finally diagnosed me with Thrush. He wants me to wait until I'm done with my current course of medication before starting the thrush medications.Once again, this has been going on for at least 2 months, but my doctor didn't take note of it until the antibiotics made it flare up more.My question is this. I have conclusive HIV negative and Diabetes negative test results... WHAT ELSE COULD CAUSE THIS!?!?!?!?!I am terrified, please help!!!!",

            "answer": "Hello,The commonest cause for causing such white patches is oral candidiasis or thrush. The other causes are leukopakia or oral lichen planus. Candida may involve the oral cavity (thrush), the pharynx or esophagus, the gastrointestinal tract, the urinary bladder, or the genitalia. The best tests involved in the diagnosis of candida are scrapping or swab examination of the scrapings after KOH mounting. The other test that can be done is fungal culture of the scrapings from the tongue of the vaginal swabs.I suggest you to get it evaluated from an ENT specialist. Hope it helps. Take care and do keep me posted on how you are doing. Warm regards.",
