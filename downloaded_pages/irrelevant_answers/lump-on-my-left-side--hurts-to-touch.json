            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!In all probability there is a boil or abscess. You can treat this by applying a warm cloth to the area. This encourages the pus to come to the surface, make a mouth and drain. Once the boil has drained, the area should be washed with antibacterial soap and an antibacterial cream applied and kept dry, bandaged and sterile.\u00a0\u00a0However, if you have any medical problems like diabetes, please consult a doctor, and do not wait for it to heal. Also if the boil appears to spread, the area around it becomes progressively red, the also consult a doctor. This may need incision and drainage.In your case I would recommend you consult a doctor immediately. It will probably need to be drained unless it is very small. Take care!",
