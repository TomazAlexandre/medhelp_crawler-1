            "answer": "It means there is a CHANCE you have diabetes while being pregnant but it will most likely go away once u give birth. The risks are mainly that you will have a big baby and there are a few other risks. Most outcomes are good so dont stress. Also, most people that fail the 1 hr test, end up passing the 3 hr. I always fail the 1 hr but pass my 3 hr test with all my kids. Eat how u normally do EXCEPT, the morning of the test, do not eat a high calorie/sugary breakfast. If ur doc said u can eat than eat like an egg no salt with a dry piece of toast. Take care",

            "answer": "Don't sweat it to much. Some people pass the 3 hour. And if you do have gestational\u00a0\u00a0diabetes\u00a0\u00a0it just means your body is kicking into overdrive to produce for your babe. And your babe doesn't need all the sugars so it's kicked back to you. After birth you usally regulate yourself. But it means you have a higher chance of diabetes in your future.The baby side effects are being larger. Heart development\u00a0\u00a0(which is like 5% chance of issues). Which they will check with a echo and monitor\u00a0\u00a0you closely so s/he don't get to big.I had\u00a0\u00a0g.d with first son (at 30 weeks ) and this one I was tested at 14 weeks and I have g.d and been managing\u00a0\u00a0it since then (now 27 weeks)\u00a0\u00a0my resting sugars stink so I have to take insulin at night. I'll probably\u00a0\u00a0have to increase my dose soon.My first son was fine, he just had low blood sugar at birth, which after his first bottle he was fine!This one is developing\u00a0\u00a0perfectly, on track and we're keeping it that way!!Don't worry!! (Easier\u00a0\u00a0said then done I know)\u00a0\u00a0 eat high protein foods, try to cut the sugars as much as you can. Your body still needs carbs to help the baby grow. Just pair it with a protein. You'll both be fine :)",

            "answer": "I had to take the three hour one to begin with in Australia ( might just be my state not sure) they only do the three hour one because Doing one hour tests is a waste of time and resources when most people fail the one hour one. Before they changed it I knew plenty of women that failed the one hour but passed the three hour. No point in cutting out sugar a week prior it won't change anything just fast prior to your test you will be fine. Of you have to eat sonthing don't eat anything to heavy or sugary",

            "answer": "I failed the 1hr by 1 point & ended up failing the 3hr by a couple points. I met with GD counselors today & it doesn't seem as scary as I thought! My doctor told me to do a carb load a couple days before the 3hr to keep your body from crashing & your not supposed to eat before the test bc they need your fasting blood sugar levels when you start. Good luck!",

Gestational diabetes usually goes away after birth but can happen in every one of your pregnancies. More than likely your doctor would want to see you every 2 weeks instead of 4.

Regardless the outcome, you'll be fine and even with gestational diabetes, it will be managed and monitored well.Your body will benefit from cutting out (or significantly down) refined carbs such as white bread, white pasta, white rice etc. Obviously steering clear of refined sugars too. Add cinnamon to your breakfast cereal as its good for stabling blood sugar levels.",

    "question": "So I had my glucose test last Monday and I got a call today saying that I failed and I will have to do the 3 hour test. So I'm kinda freaking out. Does this mean my baby could have diabetes? I take the 3 hour test on Friday, should I completely lay off sugar until then? I'm not that shocked because diabetes runs in my family but it's so scary cause of course I was hoping it would come back negative. I just want some more info mommies.",
