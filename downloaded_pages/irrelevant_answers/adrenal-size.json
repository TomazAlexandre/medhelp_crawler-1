            "answer": "With high blood pressure - were other tests done like renin, aldosterone, metaphrines, cortisol, ACTH?An enlarged adrenal can be an issue - that one is pretty big. It would not, to my mine, impact urination since the role of an adrenal is totally separate from the kidney. Have you seen an endo?Fatty liver shows up in people with elevated cortisol sometimes - and that raises BP - there are a lot of symptoms. Frequent peeing can also be a pituitary issue - diabetes insipidus.I would find a good endo - get testing.",
