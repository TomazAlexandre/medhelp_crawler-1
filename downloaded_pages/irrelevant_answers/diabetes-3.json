            "answer": "In the UK, diabetes test measurements are presented as mmol/l [millimoles/liter]. Normal fasting mmo/l glucose [blood sugar] ranges are 3.88 to 5.5 mmol/l. If your \"gone up to 18points\" is a fasting 18 mmol/l you are in the danger zone of having serious life threatening health issues. Please educate yourself on the hows/what-to-do's on diabetes control and management before its too late. Lifestyle changes must be made; if overweight lose the excess poundage/kilos, learn to eat a proper diabetic diet, and exercise at least 30-60 minutes daily. Have you discussed and/or started diabetes oral medication and/or use of insulin with your doctor?An above normal ALT indicates your liver is inflamed/swollen. If your liver panel also shows an above normal AST [Aspartate Aminotransferase] these are potential signs of liver disease. Have you been tested for Hep A, B, and C? Decreasing ALT levels requires further testing to determine the cause of your livers inflammation. You may wish to discuss with your current doctor a referral to an Hepatologist [liver disease specialist] for further evaluation and testing. Good luck",
