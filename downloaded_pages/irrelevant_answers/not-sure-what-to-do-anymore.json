            "answer": "Sounds like you've got a lot to deal with, and it's likely with the myriad of symptoms that they come from multiple causes, so may not make sense as a whole. If some likely related symptoms were compartmentalized, maybe you could address them bit by bit.Have you been thoroughly evaluated by a neurologist? Seems a large number of your symptoms could fit into that category.Activity and weight - water exercise is an amazing way for those overweight or with joint problems to improve mobility and health. The YMCA usually prorates their cost for water classes based on income. With your family history, I hope your thyroid levels get checked annually.Sleep - lack of good sleep can be a contributor to weight gain. Affects the appetite hormones. Poor sleep stresses the body in so many ways, and can increase sensitivity to pain.\u00a0\u00a0If one happens to have sleep apnea, the stress hormones come more into play also. Sleep apnea is thought to increase risk of high blood pressure and diabetes. It can cause morning headaches and and sense of shortness of breath upon awakening. With your sinus problems and carrying extra weight, being evaluated for sleep apnea seems a reasonable approach. Fixing your sleep could have a snowball effect and help other issues along the way. Trouble concentrating and depression are often seen with sleep isues.Sorry I wasn't of more help. But hopefully addressing your neuro, sleep and ENT symtoms will help start your turnaround. I know you don't feel like doing anything, but I've been there and believe me, you never will if you don't start doing something to help yourself in spite of how you feel. Best wishes.",

            "answer": "No no, this helps.\u00a0\u00a0It helps just to know that someone is out there listening and has some suggestions.I've not been to a neurologist because I don't have any health insurance.\u00a0\u00a0The only way I'm able to see a doctor now is because it's covered through the helping aide at the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0I lost my job when I shattered my ankle and I've not been able to find anything since.\u00a0\u00a0Everything's hurting right now money wise and I've tried to research my options... which is how I came upon the program through the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0When I got really sick back in Oct. and ended up in the emergency room, they did blood work, ekg, etc.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor I have now, took those results and my symptoms, but hasn't run any more.\u00a0\u00a0He's convinced it's migraines.I've thought about taking something to help me sleep, but my system is very sensitive and with anything too strong I end up feeling like roadkill the next morning.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestion?And as far as excersise and diet, you're right.\u00a0\u00a0I need to get myself in shape.\u00a0\u00a0I put on a lot of weight really quick.\u00a0\u00a0I know I'd feel better, a lot better probably.",

            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!I am sorry to hear you are going through so much. Also I apologize for the delay in replying. There are a few things that come to my mind that could be the reason for your problems. Diabetes and hypothyroidism should definitely be ruled out. In case you have either, a proper treatment will also help you reduce weight. Also Vitamin B12 and Vitamin D deficiency should be investigated. Due to weight, you could be having cervical spondylitis causing headache and pain radiation to your chest and arm.Swimming and cycling you can try. Also try to eat healthy options like fruits and vegetables more. I understand all this is difficult for you to organize right now. I also know you must be looking for options. The first thing is to believe that a solution is available and then to look for that solution.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Sorry to hear about all the problems you're dealing with. Unfortunately for me, and maybe fortunately for you, I can't work either, and have researched sleep remedies that can be bought very inexpensively or with food stamps. (I have 2 teenagers, and ever since I had my second double pneumonia in 3 months and almost died,my sister is supporting all of us, and food stamps is all I can do...)Anyway, I'm on Prednisone which is notorious for stopping sleep, and I have cervical spine stenosis, so the pain wakes me up, and I have found some things that work.1. Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime Tea with milk and honey. It has a mild, soothing flavor. Have a cup about 30 minutes before you lay down and close your eyes. If one teabag doesn't work, get a bigger cup and two bags.\u00a0\u00a0(Ihave to.) Also, make a second cup and put on your bedside table if you wake up during the night. Make sure there's just enough light to see it when you wake up, and drink it down. It puts me back out in about another 30 minutes.2. Try Melatonin or Valerian from the vitamin aisle--one at a time, and follow directions. Make sure neither will cause a problem with your medicines.3. There's always turkey. It puts me out like a light.4. Just plain warm milk, if you can handle it.5.Try checking out a tape of soothing sounds from the library--or something really boring.One last thing..I'm obviously not a doctor, and none of this is medical advice, but if you are on muscle relaxers for your neck, taking one at bedtime helps me prevent headaches the next day. I call mine cervical headaches because I can feel a knotted muscle right under the edge of my skull, and every time I go to sleep without a muscle relaxer, I wish I could just saw my head off. The headache pain sounds just like yours.Good luck! Contact me if you need to know aplace to check the drug interactions.Lisa(herdingcats)",

    "question": "Okay, this is going to be long and I could only pick one topic so I picked the symptom that's at the head of the line.\u00a0\u00a0I've been either in pain or sick since Oct. 22 of 08.\u00a0\u00a0Nearly every day since then, I've either had pain or constant horrible pressure in my head and neck.\u00a0\u00a0The pain normally starts at one point, either on the left or right side, and then eventually spreads to sit behind my eyes, temples, and at the base of my skull.\u00a0\u00a0The pain spreads down my neck to my right shoulder and arm, which just makes it all worse.\u00a0\u00a0I also get either light-headed or dizzy.\u00a0\u00a0Now, a few years ago I \"supposedly\" injured my shoulder/arm.\u00a0\u00a0I was having horrible chest pains that would radiate down my right arm, into the right side of my ribcage, through my shoulder to my back, and up my neck.\u00a0\u00a0The ER doctor told me I'd stretched all of those muscles and that's where the pain was coming from.\u00a0\u00a0He sent me to a specialist, whom did not question the diagnoses; simply look at the X-Rays taken of my shoulder/chest and sent me to Physical Therapy.\u00a0\u00a0Now, years later I still suffer with the same pain, though it has not been this debilitating since then.\u00a0\u00a0Apart from that pain, I've had nausea, my eyes are sensitive to light and motion, most of the time I can push through the noise until it's just all too much and I'm near tears.\u00a0\u00a0I've also had what feels like swelling in my throat and at the top of my mouth at the back that makes it hard for me to swallow.\u00a0\u00a0My MB have been irregular... sometimes solid, sometimes watery, sometimes constipated.\u00a0\u00a0Hot and cold flashes, but no fever.\u00a0\u00a0Burning sensations of the eyes, nose, lips, and throat plus an almost regular cough - though I don't mean that I'm coughing constantly all day.\u00a0\u00a0I'm restless and haven't slept well in months.\u00a0\u00a0My attention span and concentration has gone from fairly normal to almost none at all and at this point, I think I may even be starting to get a little depressed because it's been so long.\u00a0\u00a0I also suffer from the occasional flutter in my chest\u2026 like my heart stops for a second, then starts again or I get a flutter that rolls right up into the base of my throat.\u00a0\u00a0I've gone to a doctor and I've told him all of these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0He diagnosed me with migraines and placed me on Propranolol and Midrin.\u00a0\u00a0The two together had a bad effect on me, so now I'm simply taking the Midrin... but I was having to take like two or three a day and the headaches still weren't going away.\u00a0\u00a0The Midrin only sort of blanketed the pain for a while until it wore off and the headaches came right back.\u00a0\u00a0I noted that some of my pain and pressure might be sinus congestion and the Doctor then put me on MucinexD along with the Midrin.\u00a0\u00a0The MucinexD helped a lot and I haven't had to take the Midrin at all, only a few Tylenol.\u00a0\u00a0The worst of the pain and pressure in my head is gone, but I can still feel it there... like a dull hum.\u00a0\u00a0And of course now I have all this goo draining down my throat.\u00a0\u00a0The rest of my symptoms are still here though and I'm ready to pull my hair out.\u00a0\u00a0This morning I woke up nauseous and was having trouble breathing.\u00a0\u00a0I'm achy everywhere and just down right annoyed.\u00a0\u00a0I'm ready to scream, but I just don't have the energy for it.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone have any ideas for me at all??\u00a0\u00a0Because my doctor still thinks it's sinus/migraine headaches.\u00a0\u00a0A little about me and some history... I'm about a hundred pounds over weight, I get next to no exercise because I shattered my ankle a year ago, now have five screws and a pin, plus I have a bad knee and I'm just generally in a lot of pain if I do too much.\u00a0\u00a0I probably don't eat right because money is just non-existent right now and I'm lucky to eat at all.\u00a0\u00a0My family has a history of diabetes and my mother not only had Mitral Valve Prolaps, but Thyroid problems and IBS (Irritable Bowel)\u00a0\u00a0We both had yucky stomachs and I've had my gallbladder taken out as did she.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 29, 30 in February and I'm just... I need some doors here because I feel like all of mine have been shut.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions or help would be muchly appreciated.",
