            "answer": "Eating a balanced diet low in carbohydrates and maintaining a healthy weight can help lessen the symptoms of PCOS. They also help to lower blood sugar levels. Regular exercise helps weight loss and also aids the body in reducing blood glucose levels. This helps the body use insulin more efficiently.\"As a prediabetic, and possibly insulin resistant, should I be testing my glucose levels regularly?\"Yes. Test times and necessary lifestyle changes one needs to make are mentioned often in other threads on this forum. If you care not to read them post back.\"Should I go see an endocrinologist?\"Not really necessary in a prediabetes stage. As long as you understand how to control and manage your lifestyle to prevent the prediabetes from escalating into full blown diabetes you will be OK. Work on getting your PCOS under control. This will help get your prediabetes under control, and possibly return your blood sugar levels back to normal. Other posters more familiar with PCOS may come along with additional comments. Good luck -",
