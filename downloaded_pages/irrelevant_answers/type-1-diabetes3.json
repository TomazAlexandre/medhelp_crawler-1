            "answer": "There is actually a Type 1 Forum, but it is erroneously called \"Juvenile Diabetes\". Many adults have Type 1 as well, either diagnosed when they were children or late onset.Sally is absolutely right, a Type 1, unlike a Type 2, no longer produces their own insulin, or produces a very small amount. We need insulin to live; a short time without insulin would drive numbers high enough to develop DKA which is a life threatening emergency. Insulin provision and monitoring has advanced greatly in the last years, including pumps and CGMs. Perhaps a child diagnosed with Type 1 today will live to see an actual cure.",
