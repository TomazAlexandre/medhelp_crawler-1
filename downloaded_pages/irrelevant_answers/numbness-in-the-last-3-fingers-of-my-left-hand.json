            "answer": "Hi, one possibility is cervical compression of nerve, may be spondylosis or disc protrusion (neuropathy). As your work involves typing, long hours of flexed neck leads to this condition. For diagnosis, X ray cervical spine followed by MRI is done. Try sleeping on slim pillow along with physiotherapy.Other possibilty is ulnar nerve lesion or damage, usually happens at elbow.\"Bending of the elbow causes the nerve to stretch several millimetres. Frequent bending of the elbow in activities such as pulling levers, reaching or lifting causes the nerve to become irritated and inflamed.When the nerve is stretched over the elbow the nerve can sometimes move or actually snap over the medial epicondyle causing irritation.Leaning on the elbow, resting it on an elbow\u00a0\u00a0rest during a long distance drive\u00a0\u00a0or running machinery may cause repetitive pressure and irritation on the nerve\".This information is taken from http://www.*****************/neurology/diseases/ulnar_palsy.htmTreatment involves anti inflammatory drugs, precautions like avoiding resting body on elbows, vitamin B preparations etc.",
