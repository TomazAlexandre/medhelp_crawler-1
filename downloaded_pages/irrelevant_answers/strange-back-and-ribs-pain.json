    "question": "Hi. I am a 25 year old girl in good health. Been having strange pain on my left side chest for 3 weeks now. Pain goes from my ribs under my boob up to my shoulder, where my collar bone is and down my back around the shoulder blade and side of my ribs. I sometimes feel electric shock sensations right near the middle of my back where my bra line hits. But I will also feel what feels like fluid or something moving around back there some times when I move and then I get more pain. Not sure who I should go see?",
