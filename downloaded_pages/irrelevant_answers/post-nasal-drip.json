            "answer": "Sounds like youve been having it bad,Do you get palpitations by any chance?Do you sweat, and become heat intolerant?Graves disease also can affect the eyes causing a condition called TED.Also diabetes can cause eye problems, too, so keep a check on the eyes, my dad as just had to have laser treatment for diabetes bleeds in the eyes, he his insulin dependant.Thyroid disease can run in families too,Do your anxiety symptoms and panic attacks come on when your sugar levels are high or low. it would probably be best to check the levels next time this happens to you.Then if your sugar levels are normal, maybe you should be looking at another cause to your symptoms.Maybeseeing an ENT specialist, as you might have nasal polyps, or you could have a nodule on the thyroid, or it could be allergies.Good luck in here if you require anymore infoGod bless you too.Nicola",
