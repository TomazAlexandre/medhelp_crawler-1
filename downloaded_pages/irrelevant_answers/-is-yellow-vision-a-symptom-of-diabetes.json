            "answer": "I do not frankly remember whether I ever had this kind of vision episode due to high glucose levels, but if my blood sugar drops extremely low, weird vision things can happen, like the 'yellow' vision -- everything can look like a negative or even colors can look somewhat psychedelic or bright but grayed out (sort of like what she is explaining) when blood sugar levels are too low. There are other symptoms of low glucose, and I experience the same symptoms if glucose levels are too high. I break out in a sweat if glucose levels go above about 140 or below 70, and have other symptoms in both instances of glucose being out of whack either direction. Why? Because in both cases, the brain (which uses glucose as its primary fuel) is starving for glucose: if too high, because there is not enough insulin to convert the carbs eaten into usable fuel; and if too low, because there aren't enough carbs to BE converted into usable fuel. Both cause fatigue symptoms also.Her 'yellow' vision is also something I have experienced when blood pressure drops too low and I get up too quickly. I happen to have fairly low blood pressure, and so having her blood pressure checked might help. If low, she just may not be able to get up too quickly. My twin has an adrenal gland deficiency that causes her to have dangerously low blood pressure at times, and she can pass out from low adrenal hormones. This is just mentioned because her 'yellow vision' when getting up could be a blood pressure symptom. Again, most doctors think that as long as the person with low blood pressure isn't dangerously low, this is actually a health BENEFIT and not a problem. But it should be tested so you are aware if her blood pressure is a bit low.All of that being said, yes, I think your daughter needs to be tested. Being thin and having a big appetite are symptoms of diabetes. Many children experience some hypoglycemic episodes before becoming diabetic, so she could be experiencing both highs and lows. I think you should have her tested without delay. A fasting glucose test will show if she is diabetic, and a glucose tolerance test may show if she is getting hypo at points during the day. Better to test than to just wonder, for both are treatable and she will feel better once a diagnosis of some sort is found. Let's hope it is something very minor, but if diabetes, do come back and converse with the folks on this site...lotsa good advice from all of these readers.",

    "question": "My 8 year old daughter has been recently complaining of\u00a0\u00a0episodes of feeling 'dizzy' to the point she needs to sit down, and seing 'yellow'. She\u00a0\u00a0also goes to the bathroom regularly during the night. I have not noticed any weight loss but she is very thin anyway.Recently shehas been looking very pale. She has a good appetite and is very active. However, she complains of being tired often. I have been searching for an explanation to why she is seeing yellow but cannot find anything. Could her symptoms indicate diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0I am becoming very concerned so any help from anyone would be much appreciated, before I book an appointment with our family GP.Karina",
