            "answer": "I have been being treated. For type 2 diabetes. I tell you, sorry to the MD doctors. They scared the heck out of me. I attend diabetes classes on eating which I recommend. They simplify what to eat. How to eat. Andvwhat the numbers mean. I take my readings all the time . I want to know what happened to me one hour two three hour after I eat different things. I also compair myself to other diabetic people. Hear is my conclusion. Never go over 300 with any food if you can avoid it. It is does bounce over. Remember what you ate. Avoid it next time. Going over 200 slightly is okay as long it is coming down two to three hours later. When I get to the under a 100 reading. Yahoo. In the morning 104 to 158 can come from many fac factors. Number one, how much water do you drink. Many avoid drinking water before going to bed so not to pee at night. Well everytime I do that, my number will be 100 never over 170. I drink water right after my reading.. one hour later my numbers are at 94 or lower. You want to avoid spiking. That allows a hormone to make you fat without eating. Eat fresh fruits and vegetables. Fiber foods. Clean protein but not too much also. Take soda off your list. Also fruit juices.once in a while. Moderation. Let yourself have a coke or root beer soda that you like. As a treat yourself. Red cabernet sauvignon wines in moderation only 4 oz per day. Coffee tea water all ok. Avoid sugar under 100 mg per day. 4 mg is a tea spoon size. Exercise in moderation. Walk in moderation. Let the stress go! Get good sleep. Money is no go if you are dead. Watch your salt intake. Take good vitamin supplements. Google what supplements help with diabetes. Communication with your doctor is very important. If you take any medication. Check if it can raise your blood sugar levels. Some high blood pressure medicine can raise the sugar levels. Know your body. It is the inly one you will have.",

    "question": "Anyways, i was diagnosed as pre-diabetic, i have an appointment in 2 weeks with an endocrinologist, in the meantime, im measuring my blood sugar with a home test before and after every meal.Im hitting 160-170 2 hours after every meal, however i had an ocurrence that worried me, i tested 186 after eating a piece of bread, i retested seconds\u00a0\u00a0later and it was 220, then 234 30 seconds after that, then 169 30 seconds to one minute after that, several retestings showed to be in that range.the blood meter seems calibrated since it shows people without my issue on the 80-110 range, i also have a cold and was dehydrated at the time, not sure if relevant, i did wash and dry my hands.anyways, could this have been a false high, i havent hit the 200's so far and is worrying me, my next meal i ate well and didnt surpass 160, so im curious if this could have been a false reading or if glucose can vary so much in seconds,.thanks",
