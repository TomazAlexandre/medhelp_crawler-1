            "answer": "high levels of male hormones, also called androgensan irregular or no menstrual cyclemay or may not have many small cysts in their ovaries. Cysts are fluid-filled sacs.PCOS is the most common hormonal reproductive problem in women of childbearing age.An estimated five to 10 percent of women of childbearing age have PCOS.CausesNo one knows the exact cause of PCOS. Women with PCOS frequently have a mother or sister with PCOS. But there is not yet enough evidence to say there is a genetic link to this disorder. Many women with PCOS have a weight problem. So researchers are looking at the relationship between PCOS and the body\u2019s ability to make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that regulates the change of sugar, starches, and other food into energy for the body\u2019s use or for storage. Since some women with PCOS make too much insulin, it\u2019s possible that the ovaries react by making too many male hormones, called androgens. This can lead to acne, excessive hair growth, weight gain, and ovulation problems.SymptomsThe ovaries are two small organs, one on each side of a woman's uterus. A woman's ovaries have follicles, which are tiny sacs filled with liquid that hold the eggs. These sacs are also called cysts. Each month about 20 eggs start to mature, but usually only one becomes dominant. As the one egg grows, the follicle accumulates fluid in it. When that egg matures, the follicle breaks open to release the egg so it can travel through the fallopian tube for fertilization. When the single egg leaves the follicle, ovulation takes place.In women with PCOS, the ovary doesn't make all of the hormones it needs for any of the eggs to fully mature. They may start to grow and accumulate fluid. But no one egg becomes large enough. Instead, some may remain as cysts. Since no egg matures or is released, ovulation does not occur and the hormone progesterone is not made. Without progesterone, a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle is irregular or absent. Also, the cysts produce male hormones, which continue to prevent ovulation.infrequent menstrual periods, no menstrual periods, and/or irregular bleedinginfertility or inability to get pregnant because of not ovulatingincreased growth of hair on the face, chest, stomach, back, thumbs, or toesacne, oily skin, or dandruffpelvic painweight gain or obesity, usually carrying extra weight around the waisttype 2 diabeteshigh cholesterolhigh blood pressuremale-pattern baldness or thinning hairpatches of thickened and dark brown or black skin on the neck, arms, breasts, or thighsskin tags, or tiny excess flaps of skin in the armpits or neck areasleep apnea?excessive snoring and breathing stops at times while asleepWhat tests are used to diagnose Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)?There is no single test to diagnose PCOS. Your doctor will take a medical history, perform a physical exam\u2014possibly including an ultrasound, check your hormone levels, and measure glucose, or sugar levels, in the blood. If you are producing too many male hormones, the doctor will make sure it\u2019s from PCOS. At the physical exam the doctor will want to evaluate the areas of increased hair growth, so try to allow the natural hair growth for a few days before the visit. During a pelvic exam, the ovaries may be enlarged or swollen by the increased number of small cysts. This can be seen more easily by vaginal ultrasound, or screening, to examine the ovaries for cysts and the endometrium. The endometrium is the lining of the uterus. The uterine lining may become thicker if there has not been a regular period.TreatmentBecause there is no cure for PCOS, it needs to be managed to prevent problems. Treatments are based on the symptoms each patient is having and whether she wants to conceive or needs contraception. Below are descriptions of treatments used for PCOS.Diabetes Medications. The medicine, Metformin, also called Glucophage, which is used to treat type 2 diabetes, also helps with PCOS symptoms. Metformin affects the way insulin regulates glucose and decreases the testosterone production. Abnormal hair growth will slow down and ovulation may return after a few months of use. These medications will not cause a person to become diabetic.Fertility Medications. The main fertility problem for women with PCOS is the lack of ovulation. Even so, her husband\u2019s sperm count should be checked and her tubes checked to make sure they are open before fertility medications are used. Clomiphene (pills) and Gonadotropins (shots) can be used to stimulate the ovary to ovulate. PCOS patients are at increased risk for multiple births when using these medications. In vitro Fertilization (IVF) is sometimes recommended to control the chance of having triplets or more. Metformin can be taken with fertility medications and helps to make PCOS women ovulate on lower doses of medication.",
