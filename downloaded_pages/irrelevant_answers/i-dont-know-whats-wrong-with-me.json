    "question": "Ok. I'm 12w 4d and for the past week, I have been feeling VERY thirsty. I feel like I am dehydrated but I know I'm not because I drink about 30-40 ounces of water every hour. But no matter how much I drink I feel thirsty. I ended up fainting at work and being rushed to the ER and all the did was pump me with saline. They said it looked like I was dehydrated but I wasn't so they didn't know what was wrong with me. This just doesn't make any sense to me!!! Please somebody, anybody. I hate this feeling!",
