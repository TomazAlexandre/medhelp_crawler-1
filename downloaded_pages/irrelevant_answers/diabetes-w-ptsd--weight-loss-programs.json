            "answer": "I understand the no hunger feeling from meds as I have had those in the past. I eat 5-6 meals a day, munching on vegies, half-sandwiches, granola, leftovers, etc. I love to cook so I challenge myself to whip up something small and deelish not so much for hungers sake, but knowing that I need to fuel my body for energy. Once you push past the mental block you will regain your appetite - well, I did after a couple of months. I suggest you talk with a diabetic nutritionist to work on meal plans that best suit your lifestyle. Your doctor may have a referral or contact your local hospital as most have one on staff. Good luck",
