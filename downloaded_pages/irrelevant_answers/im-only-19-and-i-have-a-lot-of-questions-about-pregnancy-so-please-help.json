            "answer": "Your HCG should be doubling every 48-72 hours.You should be eating a regular diet: whole grains, lean proteins, lots of fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy. Get rid of pop, coffee, candy/junk. You should be eating your regular caloric intake (usually about 1200-1500 for women) with an added 500 calories per day. So an extra 500 calories might be a sandwich, for example. You don't have to count calories. I just want you to know you're not supposed to eat DOUBLE what you normally would eat.It helps to eat small, frequent meals as opposed to 3 solid meals. In early pregnancy you may begin to feel sick, so keeping something in your stomach throughout the day should help with that. Most women get really, really sick when they're hungry.Also, drink about 10 glasses of water a day.Gestational Diabetes is not caused by your eating habits. Some women are just pre-dispositioned to develop it. If others have had it in your family, it does not mean you will get it. But definitely watch what you eat anyway.",

I didn't have Internet either, so I soaked up pregnancy books (library if you can't buy any) and subscribed to all the parenting magazines.I also ate way more than I should have and gained 50 lbs! I thought being pregnant meant I was literally eating for two and could eat whatever I wanted.Anyway, congrats!",
