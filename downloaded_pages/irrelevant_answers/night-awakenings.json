He would scream and cry and would scare us to death and then he would wake up and be fine and go right back to sleep.",

            "answer": "The only thing I would suggest in order to help you feel calmer about it is that you perhaps test his blood sugar when he wakes up screaming just to make sure he is neither terribly high or terribly low. If not, then diabetes probably has nothing to do with it. If he drops too low, he probably will wake up, and screaming is sometimes how a child who is low lets you know. I personally (I am the diabetic in my family) know that if my glucose levels rise too high, I\u00a0\u00a0will wake up, also. So you may want to test him just to be sure that glucose levels have nothing to do with the situation.",
