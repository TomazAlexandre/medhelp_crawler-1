    "question": "Hi All,Some of you may recognize the name, but to be brief, I miscarried last week at 7 weeks.I have a question, I am ANA positive which is a strong sign of Lupus, however, I technically do not have Lupus because I don't have ALL the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0My ANA Positive result was low, but nonetheless still positive.\u00a0\u00a0My regular OB totally dismissed it, but I've done some reading and it looks like regardless is you have a low positive or not, your pregnancy becomes High Risk immediately.\u00a0\u00a0My question is, does anyone have anymore information on ANA Positive and Pregnancies?",
