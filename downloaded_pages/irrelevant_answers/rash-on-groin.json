            "answer": "For over a year I have had an itchy red rash on my scrotum and legs.\u00a0\u00a0My penis is itchy as well.My doctor first prescribed my problem as jock itch, but after several weeks the symptoms only got worse.\u00a0\u00a0He referred me to a dermatologist, who determined it was Excema.\u00a0\u00a0For a year now, I daily apply excema cream so I can live with the itch and sleep at night.But it's not going away, only getting worse.\u00a0\u00a0I'm starting to think I have scabies.\u00a0\u00a0I sleep with my two dogs and probably don't wash my sheets as often as I should.I need to go back to the dermatologist but I find the experience to be very embarrasing and uncomfortable.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't help that the doctor's office is cold and makes my Little Man shrivel up and look small in front of all those nurses.",

    "question": "A while back I had a rash on my groin area. It was only located in the folds of my skin where where my upper thigh and groin meet. It was a solid red rash that ran the hole length of the fold.\u00a0\u00a0It\u00a0\u00a0itched and burned at times, was red and appeared to be raw looking(especially after I showered),\u00a0\u00a0had a slight odor, and a well defined border. It seemed to match the symptoms and look of jock itch, but I tried over the counter medications such as lamisil and lotramin and they did not seem to cure it (although tinactin helped with the itching). I had looked online and came across a page on erythrasma. I am not reallly overweight (5'11 185lbs) and I do not believe I have diabetes but I noticed that I had one symptom they had mentioned which was a slight wrinkeling of the skin in the area surrounding the rash. So I\u00a0\u00a0took erythromycin and the rash eventually went away, but I am not sure if it was\u00a0\u00a0the medicine that healed it or if it just healed on its own over time.\u00a0\u00a0When it did healed\u00a0\u00a0the rash went away but the skin was white and flakey. I tried to keep the area dry with gold bond medicated powder, but the symptoms of the rash have come back.Questions:1. do you have any idea what it could be.2. Do you think i should get another prescription of enthromycin or fusidic acid cream.3. Do you have any reccomendations for treatment. ie diet change,certian vitamins, or medication4. Do you think it is better to use gold bond medicated powder or baby powder to keep the area dry?Thanks.",
