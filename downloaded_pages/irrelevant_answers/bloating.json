            "answer": "Hi!Generalized body edema (or swelling due to water retention) can be very serious. It can be due to severe anemia, a failing heart, serious kidney disease, liver failure or disorder, electrolyte imbalance, polycystic ovary, low protein in the blood, and disorders of adrenal gland. This is something for which you must consult a doctor ASAP, preferably an internal medicine specialist. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include renal issues, systemic inflammation, autoimmune conditions, cardiovascular issues, hormonal/ endocrine issues, medication side effect etc. I would suggest getting this evaluated by a primary care physician initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "I have started to have issues with retaining water really bad, especially in the winter time. I drink about 5 bottles of water that are 750ml a day and the bloating will go down. I watch my sodium intake and keep it minimal, however, i defiantly notice i will retain more when i eat more salt. Every morning i wake up with bloating, which is typically in my fingers, feet and face to the point that my rings are so tight on my fingers. As i drink more water through out the day and \"pee out\" the toxins, the bloating goes away. Could it be more than just retaining water due to sodium intake???\u00a0\u00a0I had half my pancreas removed in 2004, but i check my blood sugar pretty often and its never high, and i have not been officially dx with diabetes... could it be a liver or kidney issues? should i talk to my PCP?",
