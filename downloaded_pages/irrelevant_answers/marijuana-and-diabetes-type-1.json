            "answer": "I am not sure, the effect marijuana has on my blood sugars, but I have been smoking on and off (mostly on lol) for about a year and while many people say it is bad especially with diabetes, I would say both from scientific evidence and personal experience that if you want to get intoxicated, marijuana is a much smarter choice for diabetics(and honestly anyone for that matter). As long as you have the discipline to not eat while high (or just bolus for it and test blood sugar, I can still manage that even stoned), it isn't really dangerous in my opinion. So my advice to anyone else would basically be, think about what your doing and probably test first, but if you must, smoking pot is a much safer choice for diabetics than drinking (and honestly more fun in my opinion).",

            "answer": "Hey guys, maybe I'm a little late on the post but I wanna try weed at least once in my life but im diabetic... what EXACTLY does it do? Does it increase your sugar thing like you were at 5.8 before and after smoking or after the effect when your back to normal its a 20 or does it go down like to 2.Cuz I know for a fact you should always watch your glycemy if u wanna drink because u might go in hypo or under 4... w.e way you say it",

    "question": "Hi,My name is jean. i just joined this website for one purpose. to talk and informate about marijuana and diabetes. well the knowledge that i know of. Im 16 years old and have been diabetec for 3 years now. you ask anyone about diabetes and they say they hate it just like me. we hate the daily injections we have to give ourselves, we hate checking our sugar, we hate not eating and enjoying what our other friends do... because of diabetes. i had to stop playing the sport i love football, because of diabetes. just because u have it doesnt mean you have to stop playing, but my parents didnt like the idea of me playing because they're terrified of seeing me laying down on the field going into some type of coma or whatever. but thats not the point. ive been smoking weed since the age of 12. i enjoy it. it doesnt hurt people around me. definantly doesnt hurt me. when i found out i had diabetes i lost over 20 pounds of muscle and fat, i was more fatigued, and drinking water like it was going to be the last water i ever tasted. when checked at my doc, the glucose meter couldnt even read my sugar. it was to high. my A1C was 15.7%. im not lying i have the medical papers to prove it. while all this i thought to myself i HAVE to quit smoking if not it might do worse. so i didnt care. i went and did my little experiment smoking weed and managing my diabetes. it HAD TO BE the best decision i have ever made so far. i smoke before i eat my sugar around the 80's-90's. after i finish eating a couple hours later smoke again same sugars. i personally think the THC makes a great contribution to your pancreas and the insulin. now my A1C is 5.8% on paper thats im not diabetec. but i still have to inject and all that but i think the weed helps.Now i have seen some polls posted saying marijuana gives you \"munchies\" yes of course thats true. and its dangerous when you eat excessive carbs. but YOU\u00a0\u00a0have the power to control it.Always remember, marijuana takes over you when you ALLOW it to take over you. its not the marijuanas fault.\u00a0\u00a0ive been so high that ive felt clouds. but i am still in control. ive never done something i regret when im high. im fully aware of what im doing. i MIGHT do it retardingly but i noe what im doing.Now\u00a0\u00a0mind you marijuana helps your condition (mypersonal opnion not scientifically proven..... yet)but im not saying to go and be a \"burnout\" and smoke weed every time your high dies. it all depends on the person. how strong your mind is.thats just my opinions. people might dissagree. people might not approve. people might say its immoral.but thats why its called OPINION. i could care less of what people might think or might not think. its my body its working for me and i WILL continue what im doing. people might do what im doing. try it out. it wont kill you, it wont land you in a hospital, and its DAMN SURE BETTER THAN HAVING LOW SUGARS.questions or comments???i would love to hear them.again i hope eveyone out there experiencing from diabetes gets better.. not better. i hope for a cure such as like billions and billions people do.GOD BLESS ! !",
