            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Fatigue could be due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism or due to liver problems. Hypothyroidism and liver problems can also cause rash. Another possibility is sleep disturbances. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, low Vit b12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium.\u00a0\u00a0Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",
