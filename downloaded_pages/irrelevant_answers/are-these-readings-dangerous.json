            "answer": "Hi. I'm no doctor. But I think one of the important considerations should be your high pulse pressure. That's the difference between the numbers. Try laying down for five minutes completely relaxed. Then take it. Looking at you heart rate. That's important. Then take it when you stand up. See whether it increases or decreased as soon as you stand up. If it goes back to same figures when you lay down, that's good. If your bp drops more or goes up more than s-20 or d10 and your heart rate on standing goes up more than 15 beats, you may have \"orthostatic hypertension\", or hypotension. A very difficult thing to work out. Took years to work out my issue, which was underlying back issues activating nerves in the sympathetic nervous system.",

    "question": "My concern is I checked my Bp today and it seems to be running high, numbers I got was 150/63 148/70 132/72 142/89 128/70....seems my systolic is always pretty high through the day....this was on my home digital monitor. Are these numbers \"emergency\" or \"contact my cardiologist\" type numbers? I'm 22 years old, I go to the gym mon-fri for at least an hour so I get plenty of exercise. I'm male a little bigger than average 6'3 230 I'm slim for my weight, and last visit to my doctor a couple months back it was 120/72. I've been on losartan 100mg/hctz for 5 months for high blood pressure. Please help me with some insight or what I should do?",
