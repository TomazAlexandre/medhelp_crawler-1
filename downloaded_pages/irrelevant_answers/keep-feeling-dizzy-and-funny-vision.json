            "answer": "It could be hypoglycemia. I was getting spells that's sound like yours almost every day after working or exercising. I would get very faint, hands would shake, really hot and sweaty, my vision got blurry and I felt really really hungry. After eating something I would feel better about 20 minutes later. It got really bad tho where I literally had to stuff my face with whatever I could find to eat because waiting 20 minutes wasn't an option for me cuz it felt so scary and bad. The dr said it was low blood sugar, hypoglycemia, an that I should have a high protein breakfast and limit the carbs and sugar in the morning. It did help but what really helped me was keeping some jelly beans or candy with me at all times and when that feeling would hit I would eat a handful and feel better within 5 minutes.",
