            "answer": "I took the one hour test, drank the orange drink (which is actually NOT as bad as everyone says!) And had my blood drawn. My results took a week and were normal. From what ive heard, the 3 hour test consists of taking your blood every three hours after drinking the drink. If you fail again, you have gestational diabetes and this is when measures are taken to control your blood sugar levels. Changing your diet has a lot to do with it, as well as taking medication.",
