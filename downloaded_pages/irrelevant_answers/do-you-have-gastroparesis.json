            "answer": "I was just at my Dr.'s yesterday asking him various questions about gastroparesis and my Type 1 Diabetes. I recently had a low in the middle of the night which scared me\u00a0\u00a0a lot because I couldn't get my blood sugar up quickly due to the gastroparesis. I then overate and later went the opposite direction - very high sugars. Was trying to get assistance with how to determine the amount of carbs to have to get my sugars to go up without going to high.",

            "answer": "hello, I read through your comment. I'm doing some research about Type 1 diabetes and gastroparesis, but I'm not able to give specific medical advice about gastroparesis.I do know there is a page on the American diabetes association website that discusses gastroparesis and it might be a good reference for you. Here it is:http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/complications/gastroparesis.html. Thanks!",

            "answer": "It's when your stomach has trouble emptying the food you've eaten.\u00a0\u00a0You can feel nauseous, overly full, vomit.\u00a0\u00a0It usually happens after you've had diabetes for a while, the nerve that helps the stomach contract and digest food is damaged and doesn't work as well.\u00a0\u00a0It can also make it difficult to manage your blood sugar because the food is digested at an erratic rate.\u00a0\u00a0Hope that helps.\u00a0\u00a0You can see the link I posted above for more info...http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/complications/gastroparesis.html",

            "answer": "I have had Gastroparesis for 2 yrs and was on Reglan. NOW the FDA has a lawsuit because it causes severe twitching and even death so I quit taking it. It was from having my blood sugars running high in the 300's for months then I could barely eat then get sick and have Diarrhea and sometimes vomit. The Reglan helped but now I don't take it for fear I will end up with worse health issues. This is why it is very important to keep your blood sugars in a normal range. If they find a cure I'd love to no. I hate running to the bathroom and now I have learned to take Insulin after I eat because if I take it before I eat and don't finish my meal then I took too much Insulin then I drop to low. This rollercoaster is what makes you feel like crap all the time!! Let me no Terry if they have a new drug that is NOT harmful to the body!!",

            "answer": "Yes ,gastroparesis can cause your stomach to bloat.A gastroenterologist would be your best bet to start.What your Dr can do is order what's called a gatric emptying study.What you will do is fast(no food or drink) over night then upon arriving at facility offering the test(hospital radiology dept. should be able to help) you will be given oatmeal with radioactive isotope then sit under a cat scan machine that follows the isotope through your digestive track.It is usually a three hour test.It's painless and can give your doc a good idea if your gastric emptying is being delayed.Bloating is usually caused in cases of gatropaesis by gases produced by food that has been sitting in your stoamch for too long because of possible damage to the vagus nerve which is what stimulates the movement of food out of the stomach.Nerve damage is a complications of diabetes.I have had issues with it myself and have found eating smaller meals,chewing each bite at least 20 times,less raw green leafy veggies and nuts and not drinking until after meal is finished is a good way to start.Somtimes liquid diets like Ensure can help get things moving again and most importantly good BS control.I don't have issues with gastroparesis i find,unless my sugars run consistently high for a few days .It can be very uncomfortable and embaressing especially if your belches have an odd sulfur smell;(But it is manageable hang in there and find a Doc that knows about this stuff!!",

            "answer": "I have it and that's why I told you it is VERY IMPORTANT to keep your blood sugars down. For 2 yrs working and stress mine were running 300, 400 so got Gastroparesis last yr, and it's all caused bye your sugars running high. Then they go all over the board up and down and hard to control. SO that's why I told you now I'm on the Insulin pump and my sugars are much better but I STILL have to watch what I eat Like Pizza, 2 pieces put me over 400 if I don't take enough Insulin..PLZ KEEP A EYE on your sugars sweets, I no how you can be and YOU R NOT FAT..SO Take your Insulin or you will end up with major health problems letting it run over 500 like you said, THAT is NOT GOOD AT ALL!!",
