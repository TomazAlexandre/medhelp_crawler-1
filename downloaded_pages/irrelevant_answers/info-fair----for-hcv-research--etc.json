            "answer": "Yeah - the funding for Hep C stinks.\u00a0\u00a0I know this topic on FAIR can rattle some people's nerves, but the funding for Hep C in relation to other diseases just stinks - flat out stinks.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Richard Darling (the founder of FAIR) is a very nice man.\u00a0\u00a0They don't make 'em any better as far as I'm concerned as far as advocating for Hep C and as far as just being a good guy and wanting fair distribution of research funding for ALL diseases.\u00a0\u00a0If you get the chance, go look at some of his media on that main site (Hep C rallies he's been to).\u00a0\u00a0He sent me the book he wrote, Coma Life, (about his experience with liver transplants and being in a coma).\u00a0\u00a0If you ever get a chance, read it - it's great.\u00a0\u00a0He's just the nicest man you'll ever hope to meet no matter what your disease is, but - if you have Hep C, yep.\u00a0\u00a0He's got us in his heart (not just in his pocket).\u00a0\u00a0I've been in some heated discussions about my support of FAIR.\u00a0\u00a0Never knew I would hit such a nerve if I put a link for FAIR up (but boy did I get an ear full)\u00a0\u00a0Oh well - too bad is all I can say about it.\u00a0\u00a0I have my disease to worry about too, ya know, and \"fair is fair\".\u00a0\u00a0Glad you posted this.And btw, glad you're UND, TOO!! :)",

            "answer": "I think for things to really change we need to change our thinking. So instead of having an anti-war march how about a peace march. Or instead of a War on disease how about a dept. for health? Its the focus. In Bhutan they don't count GNP (Gross National Product) they count Gross National Happiness. That is a country with great priorities!I've been in a unique postition to view U.S. politics having been out of the country for most of the time since Fall 2001. I've flown back to see the economy collapse and people becoming either very frightened and/or very angry. And the news we recieve here is not what people in the rest of the world are hearing. I abhor the manipulation. We are forbidden to see caskets never mind dead or maimed soldiers. Did you see anything about the peace marches around the nation on Jan.27th? I had to really search alternative news on the internet to find out anything.And my inner pollyanna says, \" Gee why can't we just all love one another?\"",

    "question": "This didn't copy and paste as well as I'd like. Please scroll down and look at the comparison chart of $ spent on HCV compared to AIDs, and others.More info : www dot fairfoundation dot orgRecently we sent an Op-Ed for all members to email to the Opinion Editor of their local newspaper (and any others they so desire to approach nationally), blog, talk forum, etc. and the response has been excellent. In the hopes that you would like to participate, I will forward the template to you in a separate email for completion and forwarding. Also, we would be very grateful if you would mail a template letter in support of fair funding to President Bush and your Congresspersons.
