The folks who were recruited responded to ads .. it say's 3000 people in Aust. Tx per year .. 27 responded ...This data is not controlled .... If Every Tx patient recorded their feelings after every Tx and those effects were recorded .. that would be a much different story .. this is not the case here ....Anyone considering these or any other serious treatments should accept responsibility for their decision. As responsible patients we need to make the risk assessment after weighing all the factors .. imo ... this means do not rely on just your doctor to disclose the risks ..\"Participants were recruited in New SouthWales and Victoria via advertisementsplaced in The Hep C Review andGood Liver\"\"Often people who have had more extremeexperiences self-select to be part ofqualitative research\" ...I think the above says it all .. folks who had more after Tx issues are the large % of folks who joined these studies ..As time moves on, and fortunately R&D is moving at a much more accelerated speed than a few years ago ..

            "answer": "27 anecdotal stories from self-selecting patients is not a scientific medical \"study\" by any means. This paper is written by a social psychologist, interested in peoples physiological experiences with hep C and its treatment, not a medical study of hepatitis C, its treatment or its complications/symptoms. It is no surprise then there is no actual medical data in this paper besides genotype and most SVR statuses.\"For those that scoff at the idea of therapy after effects, or think its only a small, insignificant group.\"Nobody has ever said that there are not some people who have health issues after treatment with interferon. But to exaggerate its prevalence in my opinion is to raise unfounded fears about the true risk vs. benefit of treatment in people who are chronically infected with hepatitis C....READ THIS STUDY. \"I did. As \"Recovery from hepatitis C treatments\" states...\"Key recommendations...Further recommendations... People considering or commencing treatment need to be alerted to the possibility of ongoing treatment-related impacts for lengthy periods after treatment finishes, EVEN IF THIS SURVEY FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE RISK IS SMALL.\"It appears that Mr. Hopwood never read the beginning of the label on peg-interferon, but then again why would he, he is a social psychologist, not an MD.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PEGASYS(peginterferon alfa-2a)Alpha interferons, including PEGASYS, may cause or aggravate fatal orlife-threatening neuropsychiatric, autoimmune, ischemic, and infectiousdisorders. Patients should be monitored closely with periodic clinical andlaboratory evaluations. Patients with persistently severe or worseningsigns or symptoms of these conditions should be withdrawn from therapy.In many, but not all cases, these disorders resolve after stoppingPEGASYS therapy (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).If this warning doesn't attract attention then maybe we need a skull and crossbones too?Hector",

But presenting your conjecture as fact with no basis is not productive.GPs have no extensive knowledge about hepatitis C, liver disease or drugs. So while they may be likeable people doesn't make then an expert by any stretch of the imagination. Because some people are not warned of the possible complications of interferon can't be generalized to every doctor. For example I was specifically warned that treatment could cause my liver to fail. In order to prepare for such a situation a was first put on a transplant list in case the small case of liver failure happened.

Just because you are not aware of the warnings that come with the drug doesn't mean everyone is an unaware as yourself.I don't know how clearer the warnings can be.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PEGASYS(peginterferon alfa-2a)....WARNINGS128 General129 Patients should be monitored for the following serious conditions, some of130 which may become life threatening. Patients with persistently severe or131 worsening signs or symptoms should have their therapy withdrawn (see132 BOXED WARNING).133 Neuropsychiatric134 Life-threatening neuropsychiatric reactions may manifest in patients receiving135 therapy with PEGASYS. Depression, suicidal ideation, and suicidal attempt136 may occur in patients with and without previous psychiatric illness.137 PEGASYS should be used with extreme caution in patients who report a138 history of depression. Neuropsychiatric adverse events observed with alpha139 interferon treatment include relapse of drug addiction, drug overdose,140 aggressive behavior, psychoses, hallucinations, bipolar disorders and mania.5141 Physicians should monitor all patients for evidence of depression and other142 psychiatric symptoms. Patients should be advised to report any sign or143 symptom of depression or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physicians. In144 severe cases, therapy should be stopped immediately and psychiatric145 intervention instituted (see ADVERSE REACTIONS and DOSAGE AND146 ADMINISTRATION).147 Bone Marrow Toxicity148 PEGASYS suppresses bone marrow function and may result in severe149 cytopenias. Very rarely alpha interferons may be associated with aplastic150 anemia. It is advised that complete blood counts (CBC) be obtained pre151treatment and monitored routinely during therapy (see PRECAUTIONS:152 Laboratory Tests).153 PEGASYS should be used with caution in patients with baseline neutrophil154 counts <1500 cells/mm3, with baseline platelet counts <90,000 cells/mm3 or155 baseline hemoglobin <10 g/dL. PEGASYS therapy should be discontinued, at156 least temporarily, in patients who develop severe decreases in neutrophil157 and/or platelet counts (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Dose158 Modifications ).159 Cardiovascular Disorders160 Hypertension, supraventricular arrhythmias, chest pain, and myocardial161 infarction have been observed in patients treated with PEGASYS.162 PEGASYS should be administered with caution to patients with preexisting163 cardiac disease.164 Hypersensitivity165 Severe acute hypersensitivity reactions (eg, urticaria, angioedema,166 bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been rarely observed during alpha167 interferon therapy. If such reaction occurs, therapy with PEGASYS should be168 discontinued and appropriate medical therapy immediately instituted.169 Endocrine Disorders170 PEGASYS causes or aggravates hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.171 Hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and diabetes mellitus have been observed to172 develop in patients treated with PEGASYS. Patients with these conditions at173 baseline who cannot be effectively treated by medication should not begin174 PEGASYS therapy. Patients who develop these conditions during treatment175 and cannot be controlled with medication may require discontinuation of176 PEGASYS therapy.177 Autoimmune Disorders178 Development or exacerbation of autoimmune disorders including myositis,179 hepatitis ITP, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, interstitial nephritis, thyroiditis,6180 and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported in patients receiving181 alpha interferon. PEGASYS should be used with caution in patients with182 autoimmune disorders.183 Pulmonary Disorders184 Dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonia, bronchiolitis obliterans,185 interstitial pneumonitis and sarcoidosis, some resulting in respiratory failure186 and/or patient deaths, may be induced or aggravated by PEGASYS or alpha187 interferon therapy. Patients who develop persistent or unexplained pulmonary188 infiltrates or pulmonary function impairment should discontinue treatment189 with PEGASYS.190 Colitis191 Hemorrhagic/ischemic colitis, sometimes fatal, has been observed within 12192 weeks of starting alpha interferon treatment. Abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea,193 and fever are the typical manifestations of colitis. PEGASYS should be194 discontinued immediately if these symptoms develop. The colitis usually195 resolves within 1 to 3 weeks of discontinuation of alpha interferon.Ulcerative196 colitis has also been observed in patients treated with alpha interferon.197 Pancreatitis198 Pancreatitis, sometimes fatal, has occurred during alpha interferon treatment.199 PEGASYS should be suspended if symptoms or signs suggestive of200 pancreatitis are observed. PEGASYS should be discontinued in patients201 diagnosed with pancreatitis.202 Ophthalmologic Disorders203 Decrease or loss of vision, retinopathy including macular edema, retinal artery204 or vein thrombosis, retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots, optic neuritis,205 and papilledema are induced or aggravated by treatment with PEGASYS or206 other alpha interferons. All patients should receive an eye examination at207 baseline. Patients with preexisting ophthalmologic disorders (eg, diabetic or208 hypertensive retinopathy) should receive periodic ophthalmologic exams209 during interferon alpha treatment. Any patient who develops ocular symptoms210 should receive a prompt and complete eye examination. PEGASYS treatment211 should be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening212 ophthalmologic disorders.213 PRECAUTIONS214 General215 \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0The safety and efficacy of PEGASYS have not been established in216 patients who have failed other alpha interferon treatments.217 \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0The safety and efficacy of PEGASYS for the treatment of hepatitis C in218 liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been established.7219 \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0The safety and efficacy of PEGASYS for the treatment of patients with220 HCV co- infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis221 B virus (HBV) have not been established.222 Renal Impairment223 A 25% to 45% higher exposure to PEGASYS is seen in subjects undergoing224 hemodialysis. In patients with impaired renal function, signs and symptoms of225 interferon toxicity should be closely monitored. Doses of PEGASYS should226 be adjusted accordingly. PEGASYS should be used with caution in patients227 with creatinine clearance <50 mL/min (see DOSAGE AND228 ADMINISTRATION: Dose Modifications ).229 Information for Patients230 Patients receiving PEGASYS should be directed in its appropriate use,231 informed of the benefits and risks associated with treatment, and referred to232 the PEGASYS Medication Guide...............................................................................................................................................................................................Hector",

    "question": "Sandalwood posted this study in the thread below on long term side effects after tx.\u00a0\u00a0I found this to be a real eye opener, in that it really validates the randon percentages of treaters that are reporting the exact same problems we have been discussing here on the forum.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for posting this study, because it is very personal, comprehensive, and jarring!\u00a0\u00a0Look at the percentages of the 27 test subjects who report all sorts of issues.\u00a0\u00a0Consider how this random group could be extrapolated out into the entire treating community.\u00a0\u00a0I find the comments and conclusions in this piece to be the FIRST and ONLY that have honestly and thoroughly looked at this issue.\u00a0\u00a0The actual experiences of people after finishing therapy.\u00a0\u00a0For those that scoff at the idea of therapy after effects, or think its only a small, insignificant group....READ THIS STUDY.Thanks for finding this study Sandalwood.!!!\u00a0\u00a0Its unique.\u00a0\u00a0Here is the link.\u00a0\u00a0Note especially pages 16-20...and conclusions...http://www.sprc.unsw.edu.au/media/File/Recovery_from_hepatitis_C_treatments.pdfI think we have only scratched the surface of the iceberg here on the forum.\u00a0\u00a0Who knows what the real long term issues might really involve, and how many are really affected.\u00a0\u00a0Like people say in the study...Where ARE the studies?\u00a0\u00a0Who did warn any of us of these long term problems?\u00a0\u00a0What are the doctors and drug companies doing to find out what is really the status?\u00a0\u00a0 Read and enjoy....or cry...whatever the case.DoubleDose",
