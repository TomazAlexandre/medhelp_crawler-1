            "answer": "I have actually walked in your shoes many a time and still occasionally do. I am 23 years old and thought I have had every form of disease possible. Trust me, the best thing you can do for yourself once the blood test results come in and are negative. 1) recognize and accept that you are probably OCD, mixed with anxiety, mixed with depression- which JCF25 suggested can cause and usually does cause your body to simulate similar symptoms of a a disease because your brain is THAT powerful 2) You probably got dizzy and collapsed because you were probably hyperventilating due to anxiety 3) Try to talk to your doctor about medication for depression. It works wonders! You can go to a psychologists, but I would actually recommend a support group with others who have been through the same situation.And if you are like me, practice staying away from google medical aka typing in anything and everything about a disease so your mind can automatically start producing symptoms. That is not a fun path to go down.",

            "answer": "I have also been in your shoes.I have self diagnosed many a terrible thing, and everytime I was wrong. I have convinced myself that my moles had turned cancerous, that I had cancer, HIV, diabetes... the list, similar to yours goes on and on. Google, while it is informative is also the devil. For people like us it is really not the path to take. Anything you look up, symptoms wise, can somehow be linked to a deadly terrifying disease in no time at all. And we can convince ourselves that we have these symptoms, we can make ourselves \"sick\" so between that and the Dr's visit's and the anxiety and the stress we are not really living a happy life are we?I know it is not easy but try to relax. IF there is something wrong with you, you will get through it. I personally think the thing that is wrong with you is your OCD and anxiety... go see the Dr for that. Once you have that under control you will be surprised at how relieved you will be.",
