            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!By dark lines I take it they are blackish lines. These could be due to several causes.One possibility is black toe nail fungus. This can affect those who wear shoes for long periods, have diabetes, are involved in a lot of physical activity and sweat a lot.Corn on the knuckles of the toes can cause dark brown discoloration.Posriasis, dermatitis and wrong footwear are the other reasons for dark colored toes. Prolonged pressure on the toes as in wrong foot wear or compression of the lumbar nerves supplying the area can cause a discoloration. Diabetes can cause ulceration and give a bruised look.Poor blood supply as in Raynaud\u2019s disease can be a cause, but if it has been persisting for long chances are less.If you are a smoker there is a chance that you have Buerger\u2019s disease. This can cause soreness and discoloration of toes.Malignant melanoma, benign melanocytic nevi, melanonychia striata (seen in HIV infection, hyperthyroidism, or Cushing's syndrome) are the other rare possibilities causing black color and a bruised look.Certain drugs too can cause this but it would not be so localized.Consult a skin specialist if you have dark lines on toes.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
