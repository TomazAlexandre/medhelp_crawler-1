            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Agree with you, if the sharp pain was angina, it is not relieved by gum drops. Check to see if you are having episodes of hypoglycemia, this can cause restless sleep and a sense of weakness. The fact that you eat granola bar and sleep well, goes more in favor of this. If you are a diabetic, then aim for euglycemic state and check with your doctor to rule out hypoglycemia.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
