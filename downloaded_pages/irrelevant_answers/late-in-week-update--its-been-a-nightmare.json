    "question": "Hi all,Been missing for a week again...\u00a0\u00a0had a nightmare thrust upon me with my almost 75 year old mother...\u00a0\u00a0She has apparently turned into the crazy old cat lady.\u00a0\u00a0She moved to WV away from family years ago because of my jerk stepfather.\u00a0\u00a0 She has been miserable, and we've been begging her for three years to come back near family.She started with having a couple cats, then two kittens (oops, boy and girl, and I sent her money to have the girl spayed, but guessing that never happened, cause last fall a littler of kittens)....\u00a0\u00a0so 3 or 4 turned into 10, then I found out she took in other strays and the end count when it all hit the fan was apparently 16 cats.\u00a0\u00a0When authorities got involved, she agreed to surender all but the original 3 and one kitten she was very attached to, which was agreeable to the shelter.\u00a0\u00a0Last saturday was the surrender day, all was setup, 11 cats in carriers, one cat hiding and other 4 safely in the bedroom room....\u00a0\u00a0 suddenly my mother and the crated cats go missing, she returns, picks up the calico kitten they were keeping the drives off into the sunshine.\u00a0\u00a0She ends up in Baltimore acting beyond irrational.\u00a0\u00a0None of us will let her bring 11 cats with no medical histories and we're all presuming fleas into our homes.\u00a0\u00a0No talking sensse into her, so she decides they can live in her mini van...\u00a0\u00a0she diappears again, drives to my sister in law work where two cats apparently jump out the window, so we are down to 9 cats in the cat van parade....\u00a0\u00a0 She ends up back at my aunts and spends the night there, cats int he van and I am able to arrange with animal control to investigate.\u00a0\u00a0But, they get there and can't seize the cats cause its on private property.\u00a0\u00a0Thankfully my brother shows up, and without my mom know what is going on, he removes the cats one by one and walks them onto the public street where the animal control van is parked and hands them over safely.\u00a0\u00a0 Mother believes she left her van open and the cats got out...\u00a0\u00a0the doctors tell us to let her continue believing that since she was not reasonable that her behavior was not rational.So, I drive down last Tuesday to get my\u00a0\u00a0mother into the ER and in for an emergency geriatric pysch eval as directed by social services...\u00a0\u00a0but oops, after waiting for 10 hours, they can't do that eval there and since its so late now, the social workers who could help have left for the day, even tho I've been asking since the morning for a social worker to see her....\u00a0\u00a0 yeah, stress is not my friend....By Thursday, i was barely functioninog, but had to keep pushing thru...\u00a0\u00a0got her to her regular doctor appointment where we have our suspicions confirmed, she has lost 40 pounds and yet not one weenie doctor is adjusting her meds for diabetes, high blood pressure or congestive heart failure...\u00a0\u00a0lets run some tests, get her taking her meds and see where we are next week...\u00a0\u00a0 By Sunday night, she crashes with a sugar of 21 and is rushed to the hospital where it bounces back up to 198; then by morning crashes down to 7 (yep that is a single digit)....\u00a0\u00a0 And yesterday, while her sugar was slightly more stable, she thinks its 1975, my father is still alive and my dead brother was just in visiting...\u00a0\u00a0and the hospital is the city block where she grew up and kids are in the backyard trying to break the sliding door...\u00a0\u00a0I am next door and need to let my large wet dog in because its raining and my brother is out on the front porch cause the kids are fighting in the street....\u00a0\u00a0 anyone else want to scream along with me....They have no clue if we are looking at truly alzheimer's, diabetes related dementia or just a bad acid trip of all the meds clearing out of her system.Its stressed and affected me to the point that I finally agreed to my first round of infusion IV steroids...\u00a0\u00a0they only did 2 days, but the hope is that it helps to for lack of a better term, carry me thru this nightmare without rendering me a total puddle of mud....If only I could drink.....So that is my rant and whining....\u00a0\u00a0thank you for listening...\u00a0\u00a0always feels good to come here and rant away and have people understand its not about giving answers, just the ability to rant and you know what this kind of thing does to the MS symptoms.And its driving me nuts my brother feels he can't tell me anything that is happening cause apparently I'll just fall apart...\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate his concern, but hey, I've got thru all this so far, we can deal...Hope everyone is having a better week...\u00a0\u00a0 looks like the heat is returning, so stay cool!!!Hugs,jen",
