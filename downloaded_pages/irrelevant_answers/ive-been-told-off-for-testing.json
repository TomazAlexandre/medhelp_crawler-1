            "answer": "Solid advice from mammo. Run as fast as you can from this looney nurse. Anyone who says not to test is ignorant about diabetes control and management. Her title says it all \"Practice\". Find a diabetes nurse or better yet an Endocrinologist, a doctor who specializes in diabetes care. He/she can refer a diabetes nurse to you. Keep trying until you find one that listens to you and cares about your well being.Your 6.7 mmol/l is considered prediabetes; 7.0 enters diabetes land; 10.6 is high and 14.0 is dangerous. Try to avoid bad carbohydrates as they turn into sugar after digestion. Avoid things made with white flour -bread, muffins, etc - potatoes, white rice. Maintain proper body weight and do some sort of exercise daily. These all help to lower blood glucose levels.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes in January this year.I was put on Metformin once a day and had a 6 month check up in August.My question is about testing !I told my Practice Nurse I was testing 2 weeks ago when I had to ring about some Blood test results and I was literaly told off for testing.She told me my Blood result was 6.7 and was almost Border Line anyway.But I did 2 weeks testing on waking\u00a0\u00a0and before and after meals (2 hours).The lowest\u00a0\u00a0number igot was 7.8 and average was 10.6 - 14.00.I've been feeling really ill ,my BP is 160/80 and am having a lot of dizziness and nausea.All the nurse said was to stop testing and to see her in February for my 6 month Diabetes check up.My Pharmacy and other friends with Diabetes say how do I know what my BG is if not testing.I already realised wheat sent my\u00a0\u00a0numbers up so I'm avoiding that.I realy am at a loss at what to do.I feel I have enough with the Autonomic and Peripheral Neuropathy,Fibromyalgia etc and am due to see the Cardiologist in 2 weeks.I'm getting really down and that in itself is worrying to me and my lovely Husband because it's so unlike me but I jyst feel I've had enough and am getting no support from the very people who are there to help.Sorry to rant but feel helpless at the moment.",
