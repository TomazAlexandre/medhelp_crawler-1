            "answer": "Hi ... I don't have any clinical answers for your ? but agree with GL above to try and wait it out until another blood test is done and take it from there ..... One thing that does come to mind, but pls. keep in mind it is only a thought and I'm not a med. professional .. just a mom like you, is to do a google onSENSORY INTEGRATION and see if you use those words and thyroid or \"hyperthyroid\" if anything comes up ..... overeaction to sounds can be part of sensory integration and oftentimes outgrown, can be a part of something else, or is absolutely nothing at all but at age 11 I *think* I'd mention it at your next dr or well-care checkup for some professional input ?Cheryl",

            "answer": "Thanks to both of you for your encouragement!As far as the sensory integration idea goes, I am a bit familiar with that (I'm a preschool teacher) and don't think it's that b/c her intense sensitivity to sounds is relatively new in the last few months. She has also been cold a lot, which is new to her. I am going to google sensory integration as you suggested though to see if there is a relationship between the two. Who knows, maybe the thyroid does trigger sensory overload?I will also go to the pediatric endo forum as soon as I can. I usually don't have much time on the computer before I get interrupted, so I am extra thankful that you two have suggested ways for me to zero in on some good information. I'm hoping that the more I know and can connect the dots, the faster and better her treatment will be.This is my very first time on this forum - I just stumbled across it this afternoon and thought I'd give it a whirl. Glad I did! Thanks again!",

However, I got over it.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if its is thyroid related,\u00a0\u00a0I don't blame thyroid for all my ails so I just never but the two together.Good luck with your search and sorry we were not much help.",

    "question": "My 11-year-old daughter is overweight and has been since she turned 3. I just changed her to a new pediatrician b/c the old one kept saying my daughter would just grow into her weight and never ruled out any physical reasons for her continued weight gain. The new doctor tested my daughter's thyroid and the results were that she has normal T4 results but \"undetectable low numbers\" on her TSH. The doctor has ordered a repeat blood test and had me schedule an appt. with an endocrinologist (who can't see her until Feb.)As a sidenote, there is a family history of thyroid issues in my family, and I have hypothyroidism myself. Also, type 1 diabetes is on my husband's and my side of the family, and I have one daughter with type 1 diabetes.My question is this: do I need to be in a panic about this? And could her unbearable sensitivity to sounds be related to this? I am not too familiar with hyperthyroid issues, but could it be related to her tendency to be overweight?\u00a0\u00a0thank you.",
