    "question": "This problem has been on and off for probably longer than 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0But over the past month it has remained to varying degrees.\u00a0\u00a0The fluid is predominantly in my left leg with just a little in the right.\u00a0\u00a0You can press dents in my ankles and chins.\u00a0\u00a0My calves are tight quite often to the point they ache when I walk.\u00a0\u00a0Some days are worse than others.\u00a0\u00a0I finally decided to visit a doctor yesterday and all she did was some blood work to determine if it was due to a thyroid problem or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The lab work came back perfectly normal.\u00a0\u00a0I was reading online about heart and kidney problems, neither of which she tested or even mentioned.\u00a0\u00a0They called, told me the results of the lab work, and just said come back if it continues.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a bit concerned as I read the side-effects of using diuretics.\u00a0\u00a0What should I do?\u00a0\u00a0Could just being on your feet a lot cause the edema?\u00a0\u00a0I work at a job where I'm standing 6-8 hours per day.",
