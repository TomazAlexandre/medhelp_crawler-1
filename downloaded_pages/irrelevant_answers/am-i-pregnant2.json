            "answer": "well thats awesome that you are taking the folic acid (reduces certain birth defects) are you taking any other vitamins? you can take prenatal vitamins right now that includes what your body needs and it has the folic acid in it already plus other important vitamins for baby...so because you dont have a reliable cycle to go off of it is hard to say if you are prego or not, a blood test would let you know for sure if you feel the urine tests are giving you a false negative...I am concerned that you are very young tho, are you sure you guys are ready for children yet? what is your hurry?",

            "answer": "Call your doctor right away if the bleeding is excessive. Ar e you passing any clots at all? Is the blood bright red or dark brown? Did the doctor or clinic provide you with a guide for how much bleeding is acceptable, for example, so many sanitary napkins a day soaked is OK but more than that is not ok? Listen to your instincts. If you think you are bleeding too much and you don't have a doc to call and ask, go to an ER.",
