            "answer": "Anxiety definitely will tax you out more. But the profuse sweating is interesting I must say. Maybe your doc could run some other endocrine tests. If you have a nice doctor, discuss all your feelings out and see if they can help you. Hope you feel better soon.",

    "question": "Hi people.I've recently had a bad spate of illness, Had a virus and an outbreak of excema and then a cold which put me in hospital (Im asthmatic it was the the asthma attack, not the actual cold), got oral candida, lost weight, cold sore, diarrhea, trembles and shakes, mailaise, felt depressed. I was worried about my health and started to feel really anxious about every thing, to the point where i started to sweat profusely as i read symptoms of this and that.I went to my GP and she did a whole lot of tests - diabetes, kidney and liver function FBC/CBC all normal and clear. ( its also funny how much better i feel now that I know I dont have diabetes)I still feel abit under the weather - i dont know if its because I've convinced myself that I have a Terminal or Chronic disease.What other tests should I ask my doctor to run?",
