            "answer": "If I were in your shoes I would get a second opinion from ANOTHER doctor - run don't walk. I saw several PCP's before I found one that I liked, one that listens to me, guides me in the right direction, and, best of all, takes care of me the way I feel a doctor should.I would get another fasting glucose test and don't cheat. Do NOT eat or consume anything but water for a minimum of 8 hours prior to the test. And, I would also get a Hemoglobin A1c (HgBA1c) test. This\u00a0\u00a0will determine whether you are a diabetic candidate or a diabetic.",

I don't what or where you read your information but what you stuffed into your mouth and swallowed during those three months played a huge role in pushing your glucose level upwards. A 110 fasting, by most doctors, is considered pre-diabetic in the USA. Anything over 120, unless you're on immunosuppressant medication, is considered diabetic in the USA.Good luck.This is the Web site to read, follow, and learn how to control diabetes http://www.ndep.nih.gov/diabetes/control/principles.htmKeep in mind, \"Diet and daily physical activity help to control type 2 diabetes.\"",

    "question": "Any advice appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0For a number of months I have had frequent thirst, at times quite pronounced, and a very high urine output first thing in the AM (occasionally during the night too) as well as a couple of hours after waking.However, when my fasting blood sugar was checked in May of this year, when I first had these symptoms, it was \"only\" 110.\u00a0\u00a0My PCP said to lose some weight but it could not possibly be diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Last month, when they got even worse, I did buy a meter and\u00a0\u00a0got readings ranging from 111-118 within the space of five minutes.\u00a0\u00a0I decided that\u00a0\u00a0the thing was useless and chucked it.Based on my reading I assume I could not have progressed THAT quickly into diabetes (110 seems a long way from 126), and also based on my reading it sounds like you don't really get the thirst/urination thing until well after the initial threshold anyhow.\u00a0\u00a0My PCP has assured me I couldn't possibly have diabetes and won't even re-test me, she says I am being hypochondriacal.I have been on a strict diet for at least a month, but the problem really hasn't changed, which I guess also points against having type II?\u00a0\u00a0Or is that too soon to make a difference?BUT, the bottom line is I can't seem to find any other explanation and I can't even talk to my doctor about it as she is completely dismissive.Sorry to ramble, any thoughts or advice appreciated.",
