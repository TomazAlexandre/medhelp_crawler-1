            "answer": "Coming from a second time mom, from what little you've said, it's totally normal. You will probably put on a bit more weight the further you get. From the media, we get this ides that we're supposed to gain 50 or so pounds from the pregnancy, when that's not really good either. What's important is the QUALITY of the food you're eating (fruits,vegetables, whole grains, lean protein), and that you aren't losing weight. That could mean something is wrong. Don't worry, you're doing great! And if you are still worried, call your ob doctor, that's what they're there for!",

            "answer": "Wish I could say the same. At my 21+5 appointment I had gained a total of 15 pounds. 10 of the pounds were gained in the last month. I am trying to watch what I eat so I do not gain a lot, but it is hatd. Hopefully I only gain another 14 pounds during this pregnancy since my doctor only wants me to gain another 10.",

            "answer": "I'm 5'8 125 pounds. Sometimes when I lay down I can barely tell that my baby's still there, the only things that's too reassuring is the fact that he's very active, my health insurance somehow got messed up and I have not been to the opgyn in over a month. My main concern is that he is too small & will have to b kept in the hospital till he reaches a weight that they feel is appropriate.",
