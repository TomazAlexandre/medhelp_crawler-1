    "question": "From time to time I have had a blue spot that wil flash in my left eye. It has been doing this from time to time ever since last summer. Diabetes and glacoma run in my family. I have not been to the eye Dr. in a while because I have no insurance; I have a lg. family and can only afford if necassary. I do have an astigmtism ( I hope that's spelled right) and at one point in time, my pressure was borderline, but they then done a field vision at said it was Ok. Also, My dad died from heart, stroke complications from his carotid being clogged, and my brother died from heart problems. Is this anything that I should be majorally concerned about, or should I just relax and see Dr. when I can?",
