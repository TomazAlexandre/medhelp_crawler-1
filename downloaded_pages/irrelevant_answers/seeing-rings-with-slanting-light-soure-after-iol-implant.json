            "answer": "Many thanks Dr. Hagan:Yes it is coming from the operated eye. How long do we need to wait to get better?\u00a0\u00a0My quick reading in the internet indicates its better to manage the problem and get used to it. Am I correct?My only worry is that my Dad at some point in time do need the other eye operated and we are worried if it will make his overall vision worse.

            "answer": "from my reading about the Technis lens it comes in both acrylic and silicone, and it is possible the silicone causes more reflection. I have a Crystalens which is also silicone and I have some reflections of the kind you describe, it doesn't bother me very much though. check with your Dad's doctor about this.",

            "answer": "My father has acrylic IOL as this was indicated as a better choice for diabetic patient. I do not have additional technical specification other than this lens type has better contrast.My father is NOT diabetic, but my Grandmother developed diabetes in her eighties and my Dad thought this will be a better choice should anything in the future.Based on your hint, I read an article \"Demystifying Dysphotopsia\" by Dr. R.J.Olson (http://www.revophth.com/index.asp?page=1_643.htm). This article reports more incidents of negative dysphotopsia with acrylic lenses(square edged).This article also mentions that the lens can be exchanged should the problem persist.\u00a0\u00a0Is this as safe as doing cataract?I have briefed my Dad on these and now that he can reconcile his symptoms, he sounds relieved and willing to wait for 6 more months and not to concentrate on the problem.Regards,-bala",

    "question": "My Dad (age 72) recently had one of his eyes operated for cataract and had a mono focal TECNIS lens implant. All went fine with surgery.But from then on he says he can sees rings especially if the light source is coming at an angle, at the opposite side, inside of the lens. The rings are either half or three fourth of a circle and it irritates him quite a bit. He resorts to wearing a cap in the house, but continues have issues if the light source is from the side. Initially he was told that to allow few weeks to let the effects of dilation, and its now more than 8 weeks and he still faces the problem.He says he does not have this problem for up to 5 minutes in the morning after waking up.Is this a known issue? Are there any remedies? Please help.",
