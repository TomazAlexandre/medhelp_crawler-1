            "answer": "Have you had a thyroidectomy? I take synthroid for cancer suppression, so sometimes get heart palps. Recently, my heart rate was 113 so I called my neighbor doctor.\u00a0\u00a0She said it wasn't overly high for my synthroid dose, but said to eliminate caffine for a couple of days.\u00a0\u00a0It was explained to me by another forum member that the tiredness comes from the heart palps, as it is like rigerous exercise.Trish",

With the thyroid meds my bp has been staying in the 100-115/70 range.\u00a0\u00a0I just wondered about the low bp and high resting heart rate.My insurance is caastrophic (still over 300/month) so medical tests are a real stretch, 140. every time i see my gp.\u00a0\u00a0One more year!",

My whole cancer journey did not cost me anything except meals etc. when going to the hospital 2 hours away. No charge for visits to GP or specialists.\u00a0\u00a0Does your insurance cover visits to your GP?Trish",

(I was born in 1944 and Canada changed the requirement in 1947).My insurance cover's no physicals, glasses, hearing or drugs--ever.\u00a0\u00a0After the 1750.00 deductable each year, they pay 80%.\u00a0\u00a0I got a pap smear and it cost 350.00!\u00a0\u00a0My husband is now on Medicare (over 65) but when he retired, to replace our decent health insurance (20.00 co-pay for office calls in network) was gong to cost us 1600.00/monthMy daughter passed a kidney stone and had no insurance (a temporary gap as most employers make you wait 3-12 months).\u00a0\u00a0Her MRI at the hospital cost 6000.00, + 800.00 ER fee, + 800.00 ER doctor's fee.\u00a0\u00a0When she couldn't pay it all at once they ruined her credit.\u00a0\u00a0Half of all bankruptcies in the US are medical related.One in six in the US have no insurance but they don't say how many, like me, are under insured.\u00a0\u00a0If people have good insurance, and that is over half of the population (either through their work or because they are on the dole) they don't want the taxes to pay for everyone.Enjoy your good fortune!",
