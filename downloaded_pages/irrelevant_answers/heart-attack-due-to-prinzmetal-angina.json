            "answer": "Hi, prinzmetal's angina, often referred to as \"variant\" angina, is a temporary increase in coronary vascular tone (vasospasm) causing a marked, but transient slowing of blood flow. Along with this if changes occur in the blood vessel wall due to causes like arteriosclerosis, myocardial infarction can occur. Certain conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking and sedentary lifestyle promote this. Other causes for narrowing are stenosis and vasculitis. When a blood clot tries to pass through a narrowed lumen it causes an obstruction to flow. Sometimes the damaged vessel may develop a clot at the site of injury causing diminished blood flow.\u00a0\u00a0Regards.",
