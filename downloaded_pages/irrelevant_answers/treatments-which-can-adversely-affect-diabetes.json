            "answer": "This is a complicated issue, regarding decisions best left to your physician. Use of many medications involves risk-benefit. A typical dose of prednisone will not result in a blood sugar of 577. It appears that your diabetes is out-of-control, for reasons that cannot be determined from your post. As far as \"setting off an alarm bell\", I am sure your provide knew that prednisone has a slight effect on glucose levels and didn't need to have an \"alarm bell\". Your exceedingly high glucose levels were likely as not unconnected with your prednisone. I suggest you attend a diebetic clinic to get a better ideas as to how to control your illness.",

            "answer": "Hi,from my research (and personal experience), it is known that steroids (particularly systemic ones) can have a major impact on blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Steroids can even precipitate diabetes in person who are predisposed.Some people are more sensitive to steroids than others as well.Steroids cause insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0When taking steroids it can be necessary to take insulin as well (even if one normally does well on oral meds).\u00a0\u00a0The effect of a single dose of steroids can last for several weeks for those who are susceptible.How is your normal control / meds regime?\u00a0\u00a0What is your normal Hba1c?\u00a0\u00a0 Ideally persons with diabetes have Hba1c of < 6.5 (and even better if it can be closer to 5).\u00a0\u00a0Blood sugar range is ideally 70 - 140 range (and 80 - 120 range even better)\u00a0\u00a0It would seem that your diabetes is fairly severe to have such a major effect from a single dose of prednisone (but what was the dose? A high dose could cause such dramatic increase in blood sugars).Anyway, I hope things are returning to normal for you now.\u00a0\u00a0Please come back and let us know how you are going.\u00a0\u00a0Ask any more question.",

            "answer": "Before I take any new drug I google it and read.\u00a0\u00a0it will say if the drug adversely effects BG.\u00a0\u00a0and PREDNISONE\u00a0\u00a0is well known to run havoc on BG.High BG is also known to slow down healing,as far as taking insulin to counter BG from Prednisone it dont work for me I am currently on Prednisone and my BG whent through the roof and no matter how much insulin I take it will not come down.\u00a0\u00a0I increased my insulin from 50 IU a day to 100 IU durring the 8 hours after I took the pills.\u00a0\u00a0without insulin my BG went to 245 with 100 IU of insulin my BG went to 236 (well within the error of my meter)It will be a cold day in H before I take Prednisone again.",
