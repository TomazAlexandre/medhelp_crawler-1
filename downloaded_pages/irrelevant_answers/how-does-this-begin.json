CAn they be on any of these places?\u00a0\u00a0Does MS have an aches and pains component? What about a twitching component? Do lesions develop early in the disease or can they develop later? I know symptoms wax and wane.\u00a0\u00a0What is the general time period for these to continue (months, days?)Thank you for your help.",
