            "answer": "If you want something quick, try a sandwich on whole wheat bread. I have gestational diabetes so I am doing the gestational diabetes diet now and testing my blood sugar 4 times a day.If you eat a carb or sugar, eat a protein (eggs, meat, peanut butter, etc.) with it. The protein helps your body slow down the digestion of the carb or sugar so that you don't process it to fast.I would suggest a sandwich on whole wheat bread, with meat. Like a ham and cheese sandwich or something.As for drinking, you can drink water if that is what you like but you could also have something else. I can have as much Crystal Light as I want because it has no (or very little) carbs in it. (I believe it is sweetened with an artificial sweetener).Are you doing the 1 hour glucose test or the 3 hour one??If you have any more questions, just ask. Post the results when you get them. :)GOOD LUCK!!",

            "answer": "I worked is a OB/GYN office and most of the women would schedule the test early to get it over with and then head for the door to eat eat eat!! LOLWere you given the Glucola to take home and drink before your visit? That was how we did it and the women were instructed to eat normally up until you started to drink the Glucola. Once you begin, you drink it (we told them to refrigerate it--NOT FREEZE it, brcause it is slightly better cold) as fast as you can, and once you finish it, you need to have your blood drawn exactly one hour after finishing it having had nothing to eat or drink (NOT EVEN WATER) in that hour.Eating normally before the test will not alter the results as there is such a high amount of Glucose in the drink that if you are Diabetic, it WILL show up, weather you choose a doughnut or a bowl of corn flakes for breakfast. If the test comes back positive, you will most likely be sent to a Lab for a 3 hour test. This will determine for sure if you have Gestational Diabetes. Try not to worry. Even if you do, it is manable and usually goes away after delivery. Not sure if you have been spilling sugar in your urine. if so, then there is a higher probability that you may have some issues. If not, then again, try not to worry. I know.. Easier said than done.let us know and the best of luck to you.--J",

You already know what your doing.LOL And chances are that since you haven't had it in previous pregnancies, you probably won't this time, but never say never. Things do change with each pregnancy. But don't beat yourself up, I think most of us find that the more we have, the harder it is to get back to the \"old\" us and then, before we can lose all that weight or get back into shape BAM, here we go again.Either way, you'll be fine.--J",

They are veggies like lettuce, tomato, carrot, green peas, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, celery, etc.I haven't made this public until now but I have a almost 4 year old. I had gestational diabetes with him. I was induced 2 days before my due date because of my sugars not being under control. I gained a total of 68lbs with him. I was in labor for 36 hours and then ended up with a c-section because he was 9lbs 10 oz and 21&3/4 inches long. (my c-section was due to failure to progress, but my OB said that I failed to progress because he was so big).We are hoping to not have that big of a baby this time around. I have another ultrasound at 36 weeks to check on babys growth and if he/she is over 4kgs (8.8 lbs) then I will have to have another c-section. I am hoping to have a VBAC instead of a repeat c-section.Ok this is long and enough about me, this isn't my post, :)When will you get the results back? Post with the results and don't worry about it. Having gestational diabetes is a PITA but not a big deal. You will deal with it, you have to for the sake of your baby. (I tell myself this everyday :)",

This time is was cold and MUCH BETTER!!!My EDD is Jan 4 but we are thinking (hoping) that baby will be born before Christmas. What a great Christmas gift!!I have been seeing my fmaily dr AND my OB. I am considered to be in a high(er) risk category due to having a c-section, gestational diabetes and I also have hypothyroidism. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism 6 months after my son was born and have been medicated ever since. I have been seeing my OB every 4 weeks and have now just started seeing him every 2 weeks or so. I have been seeing my family dr alot more. At the beginning it was every 4 weeks and then it changed to every 2 weeks at around 26 weeks, now he wants to see me every week.Are you seeing a fmaily dr, an OB or a midwife??",
