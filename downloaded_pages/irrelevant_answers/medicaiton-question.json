    "question": "I was given pep for 28 days isentress and truvada side effects were pin sensations all over my body and the muscles in my legs dissolved. almost a year later I have hypersensitive feet pins and needle feeling in my feet and lower legs and pain in my toes as well pain in my legs. I thought when you stop this medication these symptoms go away how long can they stay because I feel like they are getting worse and not better. doctors now want to give me gabbaton and have not even did any test to see what's really wrong with me.",
