            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.You should aim to lose your weight slowly and steadily. Firstly rule out conditions like hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus which can lead to excessive weight gain. A person wanting to lose weight should do so in a scientific way for long term benefits. A healthy diet and regular exercise or incorporating yoga into your daily regime can help to lose weight. I suggest you to eat frequent small meals and eat more of green leafy vegetables, fruits and protein and less of fats, butter and potato etc. Drink lots of water and consume fruits rich in vitamin C as it is a fat burner. Get a diet chart made from a nutritionist. Indulge in aerobic exercises, dancing, brisk walking or jogging. This will help in burning calories faster. A calculative and disciplined approach will be helpful. Hope this helps.Take care and regards!",
