            "answer": "Type 2 diabetes is often discovered before there are any symptoms, and that is a good thing, because you can begin to do what you need to in order to control it sooner. 7.2 is 129.6 in U.S. numbers. 126 and over for fasting blood sugar is considered diabetes. Your reading two hours after food, 10.8 is 192 which is very high. Normal people without diabetes rarely go above 120 after eating.There is no such thing as insulin tablets. You are probably referring to one of the oral medications for type 2 diabetes such as metformin. My suggestion would be to try and treat your diabetes with diet, exercise and weight loss for awhile and see if you can get your numbers under control that way first. Many people are able to control their diabetes that way for quite awhile before they eventually need medication. Please educate yourself about a diabetic diet. You should plan on eliminating sugar and seriously reducing carbohydrates such as bread, potatoes, rice and cereal. It sounds like you already have a glucometer and you can use this to determine which foods and what portions allow you to stay under 140 2 hours after eating; we are all a bit different. Good luck to you. Diabetes is a disease that can be managed, it takes some work and some changing your habits, but you can do it.",

            "answer": "You most likely DO have diabetes. But many Type 2's are able to control their numbers for quite awhile with just diet and exercise, and you seem to be having some success at doing this. If that's what you want to do, I would let the doctor know you'd like to try that for awhile before starting meds and if your numbers are too high then you will be open to meds. The doctor needs to be willing to work with you.",

            "answer": "Your reading before evening meal is not particularly meaningful. Our blood sugar peaks and starts to decline after 2 hours post prandial. The only value of before meal testing (unless you're on insulin) is to see a \"before and after\" to see how certain foods affect you.What is important are your fastings and your two hours after meals numbers.The OGTT will give you more information to go on. Meanwhile keep records of your numbers to show the doctor and see what your patterns are. All that will help with decisions.",
