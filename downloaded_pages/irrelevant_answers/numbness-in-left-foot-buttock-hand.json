            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for your question. From the symptoms you describe, it sounds that it could be a circulatory disturbance (due to compression of blood vessels) or a nerve pinched.\u00a0\u00a0This may most likely occurs due to any clots in blood vessels, excessive alcohol use or diabetes, due to injury to a nerve, pressure on spinal or peripheral nerves (neuropathy), vitamin deficiency etc. I would suggest evaluating all the possibilities with the help of a doctor first. Further referral to a neurologist will surely help you in getting a more precise opinion here. Hope this information proves help you.",

    "question": "I have numbness in the left foot and left buttock. Left hand and left arm are only 80% as sensitive (to touch or scratch) as right hand and right arm.Numbness of left foot centers around the toes.\u00a0\u00a0As for the left buttock, numbness is felt, when I sit (When I drive, I have to sit on the right buttock).When I scratch the left arm (fingertips to shoulder, that is) with right finger nails, I feel 80 % the sensation on the left arm (compared with 100% sensation on the right arm, if I scratch it with left finger nails).CT scan of the head: result normal.\u00a0\u00a0MRI of the head: result normal. No trace of\u00a0\u00a0stroke or TIA.\u00a0\u00a0EMG: result normal.\u00a0\u00a0MRI of spine: result normal.\u00a0\u00a0No pinched nerve either.My right foot, right buttock, right hand all feel all right.Other than high blood pressure, I'm basically healthy.What could have caused this condition?Is there any test that can tell what's causing this?Is there any medication or treatment that can relieve this condition?If anyone has had similar experience, I would like to hear from you.\u00a0\u00a0Or anyone who's knowledgeable about this, please drop me a word.This problem has dogged me for months.Thanks for hearing my beef.",
