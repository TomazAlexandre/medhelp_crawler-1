            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Your symptoms are quite possibly due to nerve compression since you have severe back issues which require fusion. Other possibilities are peripheral neuropathies which can occur due to diabetes or B12 deficiency.If it is possible to get an earlier appointment please do so since your symptoms require immediate medical help.In the meantime do not overexert yourself and take rest. You can also take OTC pain killers and B complex supplements. Hope this helps!",
