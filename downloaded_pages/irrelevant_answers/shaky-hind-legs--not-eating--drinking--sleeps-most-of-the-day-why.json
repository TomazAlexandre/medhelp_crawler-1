Urine showed high ketones - (probably why he is losing so much fat (3 lbs since October.) fat that he has lost maybe in the last month.The Vet thinks there might be an infection (one lab was very high - and it is only high when the sugars are high, but his sugar were good, so far she doesn't know what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0 I had to leave him overnight (he needed to be hydrated) and if he shows interest in food tomorrow and eats we might be okay.\u00a0\u00a0If not, he'll have to stay Saturday and Sunday night, he doesn't like to stay there, he has been there before when he had pancreatitis and the relapse, but he wasn't acting like when he had pancreatitis; I did ask her if perhaps his teeth might have something to do with it, she said possibly.\u00a0\u00a0So I came home without him.\u00a0\u00a0I will let you know how we come out.\u00a0\u00a0Again thank you.",
