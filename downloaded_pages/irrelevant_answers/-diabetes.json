            "answer": "What is your \"medication\" and how much are you taking? What are your preprandial levels? If preprandial is close to normal, then your diet is not controlled as indicated by your postprandial level. If your \"diet controlling\" includes no sugary foods or liquids, no white rice, no potatoes, no foods made with white flour, minimum carbohydrate intake, and you are at normal body weight have your doctor check your pancreas insulin production. This includes an islet cell C-Peptide test. Good luck -",
