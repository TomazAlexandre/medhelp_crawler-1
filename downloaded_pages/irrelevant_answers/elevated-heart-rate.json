            "answer": "It could be from worrying, but in all honesty excess weight and lack of exercise can cause it as well. There is a benign condition called IST that can cause this as well, but stick with the exercise, and diet, and if you notice some results you'll know what the cause is. Of course you could see a cardiologist, but you're not really experiencing any symptoms. My advise to you is stick with walking/speed walking everyday, and try to keep your heart around 130ish when doing so for about 1.5-2 months. After that if you feel well increase to 140-150 slowly.",

            "answer": "Good advice above.Your HR sounds too high especially if you are using beta blocker to lower your BP, as it also lowers HR (in most of us).If you took your BP at a publice BP station (e.g., at the pharmacy) remember you were just active, walking, and the HR will be a little higher because of the physical activity.\u00a0\u00a0When using one of these public machines and if there isn't a waiting line it could be best to sit for a few minutes before making the measurement.",
