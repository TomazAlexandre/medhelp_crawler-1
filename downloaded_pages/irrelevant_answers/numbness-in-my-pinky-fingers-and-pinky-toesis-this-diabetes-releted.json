            "answer": "You did not even say that you you ARE a diabetic. So we cannot assume that you are. Numbness is NOT a symptom of diabetes, but is more a symptom of long-time poor control of diabetes for many years, which can eventually cause nerve damage. So the real question to ask yourself is whether you have any other symptoms of diabetes, the more typical symptoms such as constant thirst, lethargy, frequent urination, hunger even though you are eating more than usual, etc.",
