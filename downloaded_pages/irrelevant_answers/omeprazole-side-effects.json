            "answer": "This is an excellent question... at least I think so, I faced the same problem.I took 20mg of Omekproazole (Prylosec) for a long time, maybe twenty years (how long has it been on the market?).\u00a0\u00a0I started getting sore gums, and my voice started becoming hoarse and other symptoms, and it was determined I had a bigtime GERD issue, much more pronounced than I earlier experienced.\u00a0\u00a0Tests confirmed my vocal cords were burned, my gums were affected like yours and I started losing enamel from my teeth.\u00a0\u00a0 I had a hiatel hernia, and also Barrett's Esphagus, and had a very successful surgery to correct the problem.\u00a0\u00a0In the short term I was told to take 40mg before breakfast and the same dose before evening dinner, my major meals of the day.\u00a0\u00a0It was important to take it 1/2 hour to one hour before the meal.\u00a0\u00a0I had no side effects.From your earlier posts, I strongly urge you to be proactive with your health care and make sure you don't have a diabetes issue, have tests to determine your acid level in your esophagus, test the motility of your esophagus (ability to swallow) and also of course have an endoscopy.Best wishes, and keep us informed.",

    "question": "I understand that we all can experience different side effects to certain meds but was hoping someone could tell me what, if any, side effects they experienced while taking Prilosec or Zegerid.\u00a0\u00a0Both meds are basically Omeprazole.\u00a0\u00a0I also noticed that, in my opinion, my doctor had me on WAY TOO MUCH.\u00a0\u00a0I was prescribed 40mg twice a day..EVERY DAY!\u00a0\u00a0I've seen that the most common script is written for 20mg a day for two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on this stuff for the past 6 months and the last 2 months has been a rollercoaster for me.I have experienced painful gas, constipation, loss of appetite and have lost 10lbs in the past month and have not changed my diet in any way.\u00a0\u00a0My gums have been extremely sore for the past month which makes it extremely difficult to eat anything solid.\u00a0\u00a0My sinuses are throbing and I am now getting headaches.What about you?",
