            "answer": "Hi,I am so sorry to hear about your condition and i can understand all that you are going through.I would suggest you to get your blood sugar test done to rule out diabetes and also get your blood pressure checked to rule out hypertension. Please relax and make sure you get a good nights sleep, you can use a mild antianxiety like alprazolam at night. Eat your meals on time to prevent hypoglycaemia and maintain hydration by drinking adequate amounts of water. Indomethacin has been found to be effective in preventing icepick headaches. Please consult your physician about alternate therapies for migraine. Take care!",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with complicated migraines about a month ago. I have been having intensely painful headaches with varying symptoms since September...that's almost four months. The symptoms change, and move around, the pain is not always in the same place. sometimes it is an ice pick like pain that last only a few minutes and then leaves the inside of my head feeling sore. Nearly every day, my face, head and sometimes parts of my body go numb, tingley, today for the first time I had trouble pronouncing my words when I was teaching, and instead of just being numb my face especially my lips and front teeth, hurt.. on a scale from one to ten, it wasn't horrible, I'm thinking a 4/5... tolerable, but really distracting. While driving home from work I got the kind of head pain that feels as if you have been kicked in the head by a mule. I am feeling a gee there isn't much you can do for this but live with it and hope it stops soon. It's wearing me out.\u00a0\u00a0They have done the MRI, and an EEG and food allergy testing, (it shows me with antibodies for 17 differnt foods, which I am not eatting and nothing has changed.) I\"m taking Varapa--some thing or other... Which has helped the the big mule headaches but nothing else. I'm reaching the I can't function like this stage. There has to be something to do for this, living with it is not going to be the answer, and not living is also not the answer. I've been to my GP, a nurologist, a chiropractor (who by the way said, no way would he work on me with numbness anywhere like that... ), a nutritionist (with out carbs of any kind you loose way too much weight way too fast) don't know what else to do... (do you hear the frustration...) I can't sleep... which I know doesn't help anything...",
