            "answer": "Hi,Short brief stabbing or sharp pains that are recurrent and lasts for a few seconds may suggest a cluster headache, SUNCT headaches,hemicrania continua and paroxysmal hemicrania.Cervicogenic headcahes secondary to a spine disorder or facial pains may also be considered.Any eye redness or eye tearing?Any nasal discharge?For how long do these attacks last? Would you say 4 hours or more?Where particularly in the head would you localize the pain? Is this in the forehead,in the temples?Is there any association between the headaches and intake of alcoholic beverages?I suggest you seek consult with a neurologist so that your headaches may be classified.Most of the differentials I mentioned are responsive to indomethacin.You may discuss this with your physician.",

            "answer": "In direct response to what you have asked:No redness or tearing of eyes.\u00a0\u00a0No nasal discharge, although when the pain first started I did experience once, a bursted vein in the nasal throat area, causing bleeding from the nose and mouth.\u00a0\u00a0I went to my doctor, and it was diagnosed as simply as described.The attacks are very brief, 5 to maybe 10 seconds.The area is in the left side of where I suppose one would cosider the lobe to be.I abstain from alcohol.That is about it.\u00a0\u00a0Now I abstain from habitual alcohol, but I cook with it, and on occasion, I do have a small amout of Anis (like anisette), but even that I have almost forgotten about.It is curious that the AMD was actively progressing to blindness in the left eye when I firt suffered these attacks, and now with the same actively advancing in my good eye, the right one, I have had recurrance (one) of this type of pain in the head.\u00a0\u00a0I did report the pain to the doctors in Spain where I was treated and in Chicago where I was also treated, and nothing was commented on it.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0Jack",

            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for the answers.You seem to have noted that the pain during its initial onset was associated with the vessel rupture and this pain has recurred since ( is this correct)?As I have posted in my previous post, sharp pains that occur in one of side of the head that lasts for a few seconds may be hemicrania continua, a paroxysmal hemicrania and cluster headaches. I suggest that you discuss this with your physicians so you may be assessed along this line. An MRI scan may also be able to help to exclude involvement of nearby soft tissues. An ear assessment may also help.Your AMD and the headaches may be separate complaints.At this point, I can not say if the headaches are due to the progressing AMD.It is best to discuss this with a neuro ophthalmologist.",

            "answer": "After rereading your input, thank you by the way, there are some other variable and applicable factors I had not mentioned.There is sibling adult diabetes in my family, and, you probably suspected, my maternal grandmother was diabetic.You did mention the spine, and I have fractured three dorsal and three thoracic vertabrae while in my teens.The AMD I have is the wet type, and there it is accompanied by a slightly detached retina which manifests itself from time to time as pin-point lights.\u00a0\u00a0I am accustomed to them, and I ignore them.Does any of that have anything to do with the head pain??\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0Jack",

            "answer": "Hi,We can not exactly tell.But in your case, I do suggest that you have a complete assessment done including a scan of the cervical spine and evaluation of the neck vessels ( carotid duplex) . If a strong history of diabetes runs in the family,I suggest you have your blood sugar levels determined also. Diabetes can hasten development of plaque build up in blood vessels and this may lead to vessel stenosis ( or narrowing) or vascular spasms that may present as pain or headaches.A diagnostic evaluation is necessary.So as we go along, cluster headaches,tension headaches, and cervicogenic headaches are your differentials.With regards to the AMD, a neuroophthalmologist will be the best person to help you.",

            "answer": "OK, first, thank you prfoundly for all your help and information.\u00a0\u00a0I am curious about one last thing I noticed the past two days.\u00a0\u00a0In my better eye there is what is called a sotoma.\u00a0\u00a0When I blink my eye looking at this 14\" screen, I can see the oultline and center of it briefly.\u00a0\u00a0It is about 1 1/2\" across and about 1\" up and down from about 14\" distance.\u00a0\u00a0When I do the same while looking at my TV screen, it is about 20\" wide.In certain conditions it is blue in color, but it can also appear as red.\u00a0\u00a0Does this tell you anything at all. I have looked up the key words scotoma red, scotoma blue and scotoma red and blue, but I do not get information that I can understand.I really am not a hypochondriac, but you have been so informative, and I have never had anyone to answer these questions.\u00a0\u00a0I believe this is the last of the stored questions I have.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very kindly for your patience.

            "answer": "Hi,You are welcome.Opthalmology is not my specialty but scotomas do affect color perception.Color is largely perceived through the neural receptors within the retina ( a deep layer of the eye) which is affected in patients with scotoma.This may partly explain it. Try to search scotoma and color or scotoma and retina and cones/rods.I hope this helps.Feel free to post for anything.",
