            "answer": "Basically you need to be fastening. Can't eat or drink nothing after 12:00am. When you go to your apt they'll give you a sugary drink to see if your diabetic. You have 5 mins to drink it and you cannot eat or drink nothing at all. It will be an hour wait at the waiting room till they call you to draw blood. I personally like the Orange drink and had it all 3 of my pregnancies. The fruit punch is to much that out of 2 I failed it.",
