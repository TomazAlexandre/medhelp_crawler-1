            "answer": "You will start feeling the wd symptoms when you cut down. When you are taking 0 for the first day you will not feel good...just not as bad as ct. It's good that you've had some tests done and you don't have to worry about your liver and diabetes. Your lightheadedness could be due to a sudden change in blood pressure. Does it happen when you first stand up? I had a strange kinda pressure feeling in my head. Drug withdrawl is a physical illness and you won't feel good for a few days even with a taper. The good news is you will start to feel better. Just hang in there and try to tough it out during the first few clean days. There will still be mental stuff after the physical so keep posting and lean on us for support. You know where to find me if you need me Irish. Corey",

It is better to space them throughout the day. You are getting close to being done. Maybe try 1/2s like 4 halves for several days ( spaced throughout the day) then 3 etc.",
