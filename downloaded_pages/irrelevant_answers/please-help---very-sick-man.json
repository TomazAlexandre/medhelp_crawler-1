            "answer": "I realize this is a community forum rather than a doctor-answered one. Two doctors who have their links listed at the right side of this forum's pages, do jump in and answer questions here and there (appreciated). The problem is that posted questions from as early as Feb. 2nd (this is nor March 15th) are not answered by anyone and my own plea for help for my friend who pastors a large church, that I posted Feb. 26 (starting post of this thread) has remained unaswered.Posts from early March and many from February, including other posts of very serious concern, are still unanswered (not blaming MedHelp or the doctors). MedHelp is on the spot because doctors volunteer their time and get links highlighting their practices in exchange. This would make it difficult for them inquire with doctors, as to why some posts are not answered.Many of us are already having problems with our physically attended doctors (including the man I asked the thread question for) and is why we sometimes seek online help. I really don't know the answer to this growing problem but in case it seems I'm exaggerating it, I would point out that there are many research articles published on PubMed (U.S. National Institutes of Health) that refer to the problem, as do sites like KevinMD (by an MD - board certified in internal medicine). The WebMd site offers a video to doctors facing burnout, in advizing them how to cope with it (search \"Helping Doctors Cope With Burnout - Watch WebMD Video\").A U.S.-NIH radio ad warns patients that unless they are proactive in getting answers from their doctors, they tend to \"clam up\" (exact words).I posted this and hoping MedHelp will allow it because it's not intended to blame doctors, in-fact my point is that they are overwhelmed and face impossible schedules, which leaves both doctors and patients suffering. A very real and very concerning problem and we can only hope that more young people will enter the medical field as their choice of career and calling, otherwise the problem will continue to worsen.",

            "answer": "I received an email from MedHelp asking me to select the best answer to my posted thread, so I'll just click on my own post above because the doctors decided this thread would be one to bypass, for whatever reasons.My friend has had a follow up to his doctor however and his CBCs had gone even lower. They asked if he had been giving blood, which would cause his blood counts to drop but of course this wasn't the case. They have since scheduled him for a colonoscopy although I felt they should have sent a kit home with him pr prescribed one, to test for blood in his stool. At the same time I'm glad they're doing something, after having overlooked his anemia on the test results originally.I may update on his findings for any patients who may be following this thread. This forum is about understanding possibilities, so could possibly be helpful.Thanks.",

            "answer": "Hello,Low WBC count shows some viral infections, immunodeficiency states, and bone marrow failure. Has your friend recovered from some recent viral infection? The hematocrit is low but it is mildly low. I suggest that a repeat count be done after a few days and if the WBC and blood count is again found to be low, then further investigations are to be done. Causes like blood loss, bone marrow failure, erythropoietin deficiency like in kidney disease, leukemia, multiple myeloma and autoimmune diseases need to be ruled out.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. Treatment can be started only when the diagnosis is confirmed. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi Dr. Sharma & members,I am posting this on behalf of a male family member who is age-49. He has battled severe fatigue and depression for months and upon getting blood tests this month, was found to have diabetes. The concern I had for him, was his also being found to have low CBCs, indicating anemia. The concern is that I know anemia is not a typical finding in males his age and his development of diabetes seemed to be a fast onset. I am wondering about possibilities of blood loss due to a disease or other possibilities.Any comment on his tests results ordered by his doctor would be very appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thank You!His five low blood count findings:WBC\u00a0\u00a0\u201c3.7\" (L)\u00a0\u00a0Range: 4.8 to 10.8HGB\u00a0\u00a0\u201c13.7\u201d (L)\u00a0\u00a0Range: 14.4 to 16.6HCT\u00a0\u00a0\u201c38.6\u201d (L)\u00a0\u00a0Range: 42.0 to 52.0MCV\u00a0\u00a0\u201c79.2\u201d (L)\u00a0\u00a0Range: 81.0 to 99.0RDW\u00a0\u00a0\u201c11.2\u201d (L)\u00a0\u00a0Range: 11.5 to 14.5His two Diabetes Findings:Glucose \u201c249\u201d (H)\u00a0\u00a0Range: 70 to 109Triglycerides \u201c247\u201d (H)\u00a0\u00a0Range: 0 to 149Also his HDL cholesterol was 6 points below normal and his VLDL Cholesterol was 9 points above normal which placed his risk ratio for heart disease at \u201c5.5\u201d (moderate) in a normal no-risk range of 0.0 to 4.7.",
