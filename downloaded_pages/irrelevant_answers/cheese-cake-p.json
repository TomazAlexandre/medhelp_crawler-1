            "answer": "When you crave chocolate or cheese cake try a glass of milk. It usually makes my cravings for chocolatey sweets go away. Try limiting yourself to 2 pieces a day. In the afternoon and evening. makes it a little easier. To many sweets can cause tooth pain. I've had a few awful tooth aches cuz I was going nuts with the sweets too. If you find milk doesn't help brush and rinse lots.",

            "answer": "Think about how big its going to make you if you keep eating that much cheesecake and twix bars (both have a tons of calories) not to mention you don't want gestational diabetes. Two things I think about when I'm about to indulge in something really bad for me.\u00a0\u00a0Also eating too many fruits can also have negative effects BC they are high in sugar so its something to look into. And you can do whatever you want.. the cheesecake isn't forcing you to eat it lol. Just gotta have a little self control",
