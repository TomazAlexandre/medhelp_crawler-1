            "answer": "I currently have GD as well but baby is measuring fine. I now have to go in every week from now on ...I'm 34wks 5 days. The plan so far is to induce a week before if his weight increases too much.My sister was induced a week early for the same reason. I guess the issue is they probably will not let u continue ur pregnancy naturally at risk that the baby will get too big in which case u will need a c section or other health risks to baby associated with the GD.",

    "question": "I went to my OB appointment today. They did some measurements and told me that my little one is overweight in comparison to what he should be at 32 weeks.Has any you ever naturally delivered early because of your little one being overweight? If so at how many weeks were you when you delivered and how much did your little one weigh. Thanks",
