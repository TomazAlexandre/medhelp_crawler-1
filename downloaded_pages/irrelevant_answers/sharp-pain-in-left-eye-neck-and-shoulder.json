            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The first thing that you need to do is consult an ophthalmologist. The problem could be a foreign body or glaucoma or any inflammation. It can also be an inflammation of nerve. It could also be poor eye sight as in near or far sightedness.Since you have a neck and shoulder pain too, possibility of pinched cervical nerve, trigeminal neuralgia, temporal arteritis, benign intracranial hypertension, hypothyroidism or diabetes causing neuropathy etc too should be looked at. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor and get a referral for an ophthalmologist and a neurologist. Hope this helps. Take care!",
