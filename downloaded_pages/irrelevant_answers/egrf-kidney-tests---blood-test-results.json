            "answer": "Hi,I understand your concern regarding your eGFR.This test used to check how well the kidneys are working and may vary from time to time. It is important that this is monitored from time to time especially for co- morbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases. Levels below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for 3 or more months are a sign of chronic kidney disease. It is best that you discuss this also with your attending physician for proper evaluation.Take care and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for the updates. I agree with your attending physician that the results of your eGFR are stable and kidneys are very healthy. It may be difficult to tell how long will it take for ESRF to occur since many factors such as presence of co-morbid conditions like hypertension or diabetes,your medical history and symptoms as well as your over-all health. Regular follow-up with your attending physician, regular\u00a0\u00a0blood work, healthy diet and\u00a0\u00a0positive healthy outlook are highly recommended. Take care and warm regards.",
