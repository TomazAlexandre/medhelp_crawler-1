    "question": "I am a lady of 69 years old and yes I am overweight but I feel healthy.A month ago I was given all sorts of tests (liver/kidneys /diabetis etc) for oncoming Arthritis, and all that came up was that my cholesterol was a tad high.The last fortnight I have experienced a strange odour and smell about my person. Everything I now eat/drink smells and tastes like Nut oil.Even my sweat smells like nut oil.My urine seems to smell the same, but I am not sure whether that is because I now feel I have lost my sense of smell. Everything now tastes like cardboard, and that is a shame as I like to\u00a0\u00a0cook and I rely on my sense (or lack of it now) for that.Has anyone else experienced this at all, and if so what was the reason for it.?",
