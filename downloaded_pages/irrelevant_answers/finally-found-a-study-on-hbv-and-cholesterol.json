            "answer": "of course you reduce it, i have previously posted other articles about cholesterol and viruses since most viruses use it, plus in end stage liver desease due to hbv, hcv and cancer cholesterol gets very low probably due to the virus or cancer using itcholesterol lowering drugs are already used on hcv from many years but there is almost no study on it too, drug makers don t like cheap generic drugs while entcavir costs 700-800usd....it makes also sense the fact that diabetes drugs work too on hbv and liver cancer since liver cells produce cholesterol from insulin and so on",

            "answer": "statins do have toxicity on muscles and liver. this is an interesting topic, because I am lean with low TG, but with a cholesterol level of 199! I think HBV virus is doing something to do it, maybe activating cholesterol synthesis pathway.",

            "answer": "Next door in HCV forum, the opinion is that HCV patients with high viral load in general have lowered cholesterol level, and those with high levels have better treatment response. I guess that makes sense. because if cholesterol level is inversely correlated with viral load, the higher the cholesterol level, thus the lower the viral load, the better the treatment efficacy.",

    "question": "as i thought and can be easily thought by anybody:if we lower cholesterol hbsag, which is the surface envelope of hbv needed for viral entry and infectivity is impared and reduced.this very simple study shows that lowering cholesterol hbv is no longer as infectuous as beforeso entecavir+simvastatin+ntz can be a very interesting combo:entecavir lowers hbvdna and replication, so number of circulating virions but cannot stop virions and replication complitelysimvastatin, makes weak virions so maybe replication can be lowered so much or stopped complitely and fasten cccdna and hbsag loweringnitazoxanide, acts lowering hbsagit is also good to note that etv and ntz has no sides, and also simvastatin has almost no sides (only less than 1% develops sides on liver) and studies on sim on cirrhosis have found lower liver cancer rates, lower portal pressure, lower althttp://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/full/82/21/10532#F3http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T2H-4YJ4N4W-3&_user=10&_coverDate=03%2F06%2F2010&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1313510508&_rerunOrigin=google&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=377ccc9e444d7053902156ff2a6a0b27",
