            "answer": "I am currently pregnant for the 10th time. I was with a practice that substituted OJ for the glucola. As a hyperemesis patient, I appreciated their willingness to substitute the thicker, disgusting glucola with something that at least was a normal beverage and had some nutrition. The glucola has NO nutrition whatsoever and one has to question the use of it over better alternatives.I am with a practice now that will not substitute the glucola. They act like it is unheard of and are pretty snooty about it. I monitor my blood sugar levels at home with a glucose monitor and know they are fine. I have refused their glucola testing and signed a statement saying I understand I am putting myself and my baby at risk..and added to their form that I monitor my own at home and will provide those results to the office.If you find you have a high sugar level in the normal range or low high blood sugar, check into chromium picolinate and/or cinnamon supplementation.Also be aware that new research says that mothers with high normal glucose readings have babies at higher risk for problems than mothers with diabetes who manage their blood sugar.Wendy AsbellContentment Acres",

    "question": "I did the one-hour glucose test earlier this week, am 28 weeks pregnant now, and I vomited all the stuff. I tried a different flavour and vomited that too. They went ahead and drew my blood anyway, but the result was 141. So they want me to try to drink it again tomorrow to see if I can get a more accurate reading.Has anyone tried an alternative? I've read some articles online about how if you are able to eat 18 jellybeans (a certain brand) in 2 minutes, it's an adequate substitute (though I'm not sure I wouldn't just vomit the jellybeans either). I know it needs to be 25g of glucose. However there are a lot of snacks that have that much sugar in them (skittles, for example) and I'm just not 100% sure how the liquid is so different from another form.I don't want to seem like I'm \"cheating\" the test as I am willing to try a third time to get an accurate result, but I was wondering if anyone had their OB use a different source of sugar besides the glucola or if you knew of any great medical journal sites that would document other usage.Here is a study I found from a medical journal:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10561636?dopt=Abstract",
