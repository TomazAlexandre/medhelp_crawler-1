            "answer": "Hello,\u00a0\u00a0blood sugar in the 60s is only marginally low.\u00a0\u00a0To manage this a lower carb diet may be beneficial (this is because carbs increase insulin levels and insulin levels may make blood sugar lower). Eat regular small sized meals / snacks (every 3 - 4 hours). Snacks/meals should always contain protein and healthy fats - carbs mostly from vegetables,\u00a0\u00a0nuts, unsweetened dairy.\u00a0\u00a0Thisdm should help keep your blood sugar stable.Are you on any medications? Have you had any testing by your Dr? Do you monitor blood sugar after eating? When are you seeing these lower numbers?",
