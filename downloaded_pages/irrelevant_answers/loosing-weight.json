            "answer": "I had good luck with the Carbohydrate addicts diet or CAD. I lost 50 lbs but as the time has gone by I have stayed at a higher weight than I like. Their web-site is\u00a0\u00a0 http://www.carbohydrateaddicts.com I have eaten this way for 12 years and it is easy to follow once you know the \"rules\"The diet also travels well and I can get the right foods anywhere on vacation.The thing I was not told was that having decades of hashimotos also causes other medical problems like diabetes and high blood pressure as people age.I also work out at Curves 3x a week and that helps. I will say that I have remained within 5 lbs of the same weight for the last 5 years.elbamom",
