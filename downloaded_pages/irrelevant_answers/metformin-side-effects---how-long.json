    "question": "Recently diagnosed with Type 2. Doctor started me on Metformin (Glumetza) about a one week ago. 500MG 2x day. I'm getting some nausea that seems to continue all day and just sort of a general light headed feeling. Not dizzy per se and haven't vomited yet but it's disconcerting and not good for someone who needs to spend time outside in the sun etc. I'm just not feeling right.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm taking it after I eat in the morning and evening and I'm really make an effort to stay hydrated.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor indicated this will go away after I get used to it and he said that Glumentza was actually better for his as it's extended release.But wondering if anyone else had the same problem and what your experience and suggestions are?\u00a0\u00a0Many Thanks.",
