            "answer": "This isn't my first rodeo lol. By 16 weeks with my son, I felt fine. I had hyperemesis till I was 14 weeks, and then got hit with gestational diabetes at 15 weeks. Once my sugar was under control, I felt great. He screened me early for diabetes again, and he said I did better on this test than I did on my glucose test after having my son. The last two weeks of this pregnancy has been difficult. I'm struggling to gain weight (I gained 6 pounds at the beginning from my constantly eating). I'm so tired of Zofran and Phernegan, and I can tell they aren't working as well. I'm ready to not feel sick all the time!",

            "answer": "Not yet. I go back in two weeks. They are worried about my blood sugar, and with good reason. I woke up from a 45 minute nap today, and I felt like I had the stomach bug. My doctor gave me Ambien cuz I'm only sleeping 2 hours at night. He told me to take Zantac because it sounded like acid making me so sick, but I haven't felt a huge difference. I feel worse than I did at 8 weeks. I'm waiting on my Phernegan to kick in so I can get situated in bed. It's pretty bad when the motion of laying down makes you sick.",
