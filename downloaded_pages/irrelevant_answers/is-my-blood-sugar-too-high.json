            "answer": "100 is a very good fasting blood sugar leval. It is (to my knowledge) considered normal. Maybe something you had eaten sweet before the firt blood draw bounced it up a lot.\u00a0\u00a0Have you been diagnosed with diabetes? When you see your surgeon again post surgery ask him if you need to see your regular GP and have it checked. Always better safe than sorry. Good luck, hope your surgery went well.",

    "question": "Ok, this last Wed. I had a pre-op for a surgery that I had yesterday. (had gallbladder taken out) During the pre-op they drew my blood and apparently checked my blood sugar levels. On Thursday, when I was getting prepped for surgery, the nurse saw on her notes that my blood sugar was a little high and the surgeon wanted them checked again before I went into surgery. So she checked them and it was at 100. I had been fasting for 9 hours. The first blood draw on Wed. I had just eaten about 20 min. before I had my blood drawn. I don't know what the numbers were on Wed. My question is, is this something that I should get checked out? Is 100 a good number for fasting?\u00a0\u00a0All the nurse said to me was it was a little high, but nothing about me mentioning it to my Dr.Thanks for any replys",
