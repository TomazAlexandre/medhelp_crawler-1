            "answer": "It sounds like the ER doc did nothing for you except send you home to your PCP who, from what you write, is just sending you home with pills and increasing the dose w/o getting to the root cause of your high glucose.\u2022 What kind/type of infection did the ER doctor conclude?\u2022 This increase in glucose levels is sudden isn't it\u2022 Were you diabetic prior to going to ER?\u2022 Do have a family history of diabetes?\u2022 Has any blood work been done?\u2022 Fasting glucose test?\u2022 Oral glucose test?\u2022 A1c test?And, yes, your glucose levels are very, very high and you should be concerned. When a patient gets little or no feedback from a doctor, its time to find another one that will. Your next one might be the same way. Don't give up until you do find one that listens to you.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed w/ diabetes on Monday during trip to ER. Doc said was \"triggered\" by an infection and I've only had diabetes for a \"few weeks\". So they send me home and instruct to see PCP - very little other info. My blood sugarin ER was 456; 350 at discharge.Have seen PCP and was Rx'd a glucophage, which was changed after a day as sugar was 520. With new med, which has been increased from 2 to 3 X daily, I am still in the mid-to-high 300's. I am being very careful of what I eat and drinking tons of water - no change. Is this normal? I am getting little feedback from doc and am unsure whether I should be concerned.Thanks,Penn",
