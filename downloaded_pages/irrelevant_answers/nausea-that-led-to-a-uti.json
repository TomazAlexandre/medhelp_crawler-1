            "answer": "Usually with a UTI, you will have nausea, so you could have had a UTI for some time but it was mild enough not to know it but had the symptoms of nausea, and also do you drink enough fluids as in water? There are many causes of a UTI, and it just happens that women get it more than men.The male urethra is long, so it is harder for bacteria to get to the bladder. Men are more likely to get a UTI once past the age of 50. People with kidney stones, urinary tract abnormalities, weakened immune systems, spinal cord injuries, and diabetes are more likely to get UTIs. Definitely go to the doc so he can check you out, I know a UTI is very uncomfortable, if you can get some activated charcoal tabs, or cranberry juice it can ease the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0But go see your doctor.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!First of all you can get a STD even years after unprotected intercourse. Hence if you have burning in urine, it can be a UTI (non STD) or a STD or even due to prostatitis. Hence get urine and semen examined. Nausea, especially in morning is usually due to acidity. Take a late night snack. Raise head end of bed. Take Omeprazole empty stomach in morning and an antacid gel at bedtime. Refrain from smoking, alcohol, fuzzy drinks and spicy food.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 21 year old male and for almost two months now I have been getting nauseous every day, usually after I eat and when I first wake up.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s been getting worse and has actually kept me home from work once.\u00a0\u00a0Any alcohol really makes it terrible.\u00a0\u00a0Now a little over a week ago I started to feel burning when I urinated and believe I have a UTI.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve never had one before and online it said the most common cause of a UTI in men is an STD (Gonorrhea or Chlamydia), but I haven\u2019t had sex in almost a year.\u00a0\u00a0 I was just wondering if these two problems could be related or if there was another explanation for either of them.",
