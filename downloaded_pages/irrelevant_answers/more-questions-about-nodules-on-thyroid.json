            "answer": "Peeing all the time can be a hypERthyroid symptom. Leaky nodules commonly cause the body to go hyper. Fatigue can be a hyper or hypO symptom. What causes both hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, nodules, etc?Hashimotos' auto-immune disease.With Hashi, we bounce around hyper to hypo, so sometimes we are hyper and we have to pee all the time, we can't sleep, weight loss, we have anxiety, diarrhea, etc... Then we go hypo - depression, dry skin, hair loss, weight gain, constipation, fatigue...Hashimoto's patients commonly\u00a0\u00a0have rashes, hives, pimples. The docs kept telling me I had Shingles. After the 10th 'shingles' outbreak I'd had enough of those doctors.Hashi patients commonly have low D, B12 and iron. Be advised and get these levels tested and treated.Many Hashi patients have opted out of gluten in their foods. You can read this book to understand why: www.thyroidbook.comThis is my favorite thyroid book. It explains the root of thyroid disease and why we feel so awful. It also goes into great detail about gut problems and auto-immune disease.Shame on the doctor for relying on TSH to determine thyroid disease. SHAME! TSH is a pituitary hormone, not a thyroid hormone.To diagnose Hashimoto's, get the TGab and TPOab antibody tests. Next, get the FT3 and FT4 test to determine the amount of thyroid hormone in your body. This may fluctuate and need a repeat if you are swinging hyper to hypo often.Small nodules are common in Hashi and not to worry. Thyroid hormone usually shrinks these. I had four, all pencil points now. Doctors don't worry about nodules unless they are over 2.0 cm, then some advise removal. Mine were around 1 cm and I did have them biopsied. All benign. Less painful than a dentist visit. I drove myself to the appointment.:) Tamra",

            "answer": "Hi,I just read your post, and sounds kind of like what I went through last fall.I have Hashimoto's disease (Hypothyroidism) and my thyroid is multi-nodular.\u00a0\u00a0I had went through many tests, like an ultrasound, and cat scan, numerous blood tests....you name it.\u00a0\u00a0I have seen 2 ENT's, an Endocrinologist, and finally came down that the thyroid is multi-nodular, but nothing to worry about.I was also tired all day long (part of hashi's), and Fibromyalgia.... I could not get through a night without doing the biffy breaks all the time.\u00a0\u00a0Some mornings I woke and the bed would be soaked with sweat.\u00a0\u00a0I was thirsty all day, and just couldn't quench my thirst.\u00a0\u00a0I was dead tired, and just had no get-up-and-go.\u00a0\u00a0Finally they tested me for diabetes, and there was the answer.So now I just make sure that I eat meat at least twice a day, and I drink an 'Ensure' or a \"Glucerna\"\u00a0\u00a0every day or two.\u00a0\u00a0I cant believe the impact that those drinks have had on my days.\u00a0\u00a0Glucerna really helps keep your blood sugars in a normal range (For that meal anyway).\u00a0\u00a0I now have energy, and I dont get up every time I roll over in bed for a biffy break.It also corrected my IBS.\u00a0\u00a0And another thing I love, it replaces a whole meal!!!If you want a quick answer,\u00a0\u00a0I would just go buy a pack of those drinks.\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, they are pricey, but to get some kind of normalcy back into life, the cost is actually quite low. Once I started with the drinks, they helped me pretty much by the next day.I would question your doctor about that low blood sugar result.\u00a0\u00a0Its usually a warning sign for type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor called it pre-diabetes.My doctor only told me to increase my protein, decrease the carbs. Okay.\u00a0\u00a0It took me 3 months of fighting the protein/carb balance, and tried the drinks.It wont hurt to try them, hopefully they will help you the way they helped meAnother thing I learned is that a lot of autoimmune diseases are inter-related.\u00a0\u00a0Easier to get another one, once you have a few....I hope this helps ya.\u00a0\u00a0And I am no doctor, just seen more than my share of them....Laurie",

            "answer": "I think the advise I would give is to get it out. Heterogeneous means that it is more likely (but not always) cancerous as the thyroid is showing that it has different types of cells now.So at the this time, the odds are now against you, and it is more like cancer and less benign.The next tests normally would be FNA (fine needle aspiration) biopsy, and more blood tests - and sonograms that you probably already had.But the fact is, this one test is pretty much an indication of cancer, so you can either test and wait, or just bite the bullet and go ahead.",

            "answer": "I should have had cancer by now then, because my ultrasound last May said I had a heteregenous thyroid with multi-nodules. All nodules biopsied. All benign. Had another ultrasound in December.Thyroid is a little lump of Swiss cheese. Is it messy? Yes. That's the nature of a Hashimoto's thyroid.
