            "answer": "Your ALT/AST levels are high, and are more indicative of acute hepatitis rather than chronic hepatitis. For example my ALTs have ranged from 100-220.To me it seems unlikely that your ALT levels are caused solely by HCV.Its more likely that something else is contributing to your high ALT level.Drugs such as Asprin and ibuprofen can cause levels to rise above 25 times ULN.Heres a link describing ibuprofen causing high ALTs.http://www.hepatitis-central.com/hcv/hepatitis/ibuprofen.htmlThere are several other drugs and substances that can elevate ALTs.I am not a Doctor but I would also check for HepA & HepB, as these can also cause ALT levels >25 times ULN during the acute phase.Hope this helpsCS",

            "answer": "A good pain substitute that won't affect you.Hmmm...Well - I am going to be super honest with you here.If you are taking Ibuprofen to the levels that it affects your bloodwork that significantly ---- BECAUSE ---- those ALTs are HIGH.Higher than I've ever seen - and I had some pretty darn high levels.Anyhooo ---- I think maybe you should stop taking pain meds.I don't know if you can tough it out - or if you can handle the mental/physical withdrawls from them...But you kind of make it sound like you're popping Advil every day.And that's not pain medication. That's a problem.\u00a0\u00a0(Sorry - I'm being very honest here.)If you have pain that causes you to take a lot every single day - then perhaps your doctor needs to take a look at what is causing it.I see that you've had HCV for awhile - that could be the problem... Or the combo diabetes, HCV.But ---- taking that much ibuprofen ---- or ANY drug every single day, is bad for your liver. The liver is like a strainer, it cleans out everything that goes into your body.It needs a break from unnatural substances.If you can tough it out, I would.But if it is that bad, that you cannot - try talking to your doctor about other alternatives, from physical therapy to chiropractors.Try eating a different diet - and maybe adding exercise also.I'm trying very hard to follow my own advice.Now --- knowing you were in a 12 step proggie - that also tells me you may (not saying you do --- but that realistically --- you may) have abuse problems.So you may want to stay away from narcotic substances as well.OK - I hope I didn't hurt your feelings or anything because that was not my intention. But I did want to tell you - pain meds are not necessarily a good thing for everyone.Hugs, and hoping for a better day with you ---- one that is a lot less pain filled.Meki",

            "answer": "Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) ie Tylenol would be the most liver friendly pain med. Only ever take it at the recommended dosage as high does of Paracetamol is also liver toxic. Doses only slighly above recommended can be an issue.At your ALT level i would be reluctant to to take Tylenol very often.But pain is pain.If the High ALTs are drug induced they do drop back down over a couple of months.All the best with the MRICS",
