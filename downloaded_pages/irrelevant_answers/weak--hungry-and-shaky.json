            "answer": "It sounds like you are getting too low before you are due to eat which could mean several things: You are not eating enough carbs for breakfast or you need to eat another meal sooner,perhaps you are exercising more than before or perhaps your Metformin is controlling your diabetes \"too well\" and your Doctor needs to lower the dose. I suggest you test your blood sugar when you feel this way; that will let you know if you are in fact, hypoglycemic and help you learn to recognize how this feels as well as give your doctor information to go by in making possible changes to your meds.",

            "answer": "Until a type 2 diabetic understands what the foods they consume do to their glucose levels they should test at home as follows:1. Before breakfast on an empty stomach. Only water is allowed.2. Two to three hours after breakfast.3. Repeat for lunch and dinner.Go see your doctor an get an A1c test.\u00a0\u00a0See if a reduction and/or discontinue of Metformin is worthwhile. If you continue to feel \"light, weak and hungry and a little shaky\" eat a small portion of something good. Do NOT eat fruit by themselves for the rapid absorption of fructose (fruit sugar) in your case, is not healthy. Rapid elevations of glucose is just as bad as rapid declines.",

            "answer": "I also have type two and am on metformin. The feelings your getting are hypoglycemic reactions because of your diet. You need to try to eat little snacks in between meals so your blood sugar does not dip too low. Your body is probably still trying to get used to the medicine. I went through the same issues. Try to eat at least three meals and small snacks in between like every 45 min. Its alot of work but it pays off and i feel great now that i have it under control. Mental health is key also, stress management and relaxation also have a huge impact on your health.",

    "question": "I have type 2 diabetes and take metformin twice a day. For the past two days I have ate breakfast, then about 5 or six hours later, I started feeling light, weak and hungry and a little shaky. I ate and it stopped. What could this be?",
