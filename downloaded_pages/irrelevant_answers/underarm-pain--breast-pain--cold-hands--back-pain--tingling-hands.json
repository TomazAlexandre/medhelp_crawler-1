            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!It could be a case of fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome. You must however look for causes of peripheral neuropathy like those associated with diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use. Nerve compression due to involvement of the cervical and thoracic vertebrae too should be looked at. The other possibility is Vitamin D and Vitamin B12 deficiency. If all possibilities enumerated are ruled out, consider thoracic outlet syndrome.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "About every four months my health goes south. It begins with headaches, which begin in the back of my neck and become worse. Then I start to get chest pains- first on the slight right side, but in the center. Then severe pain under my arms, in my breasts, between my shoulder blades. My chest hurts when I press on it. I feel swollen all over and cold. I get so tired I have to go to bed, and the pain moves- back and forth all over my chest, breasts, underarms, back. It roams without rhyme or reason back and forth, front back, side to side. This carries on for days and days, then suddenly disappears. I've been to a doctor- all the blood work looks good, I've tried every over the counter cure, but nothing diminishes the pain. I have no idea where to go to get help, which kind of doctor to see, my gp seems to not be worried, but I am.",
