            "answer": "I am not very good at interpreting lab values out of context but you might want to ask about your potassium. Certain meds as well as a host of other things can cause serum potassium to rise. It is one thing you might want to ask about. I thought I read somewhere once that mildly elevated Potassium (5.1 - 6) requires an EKG? I had a routine EKG when I had my last physical and they only take a few minutes. Have you had one?Not sure about Glucose either. Is that your fasting glucose?Other than that if you have been diagnosed with Hepatitis C you might want to ask the doctor what the next step is. I saw in another post you might not have the resources to treat right now so you might want to ask about that. It would help if you knew your genotype and the stage of fibrosis you are so you can make an informed decision about how and when to treat.Take care",
