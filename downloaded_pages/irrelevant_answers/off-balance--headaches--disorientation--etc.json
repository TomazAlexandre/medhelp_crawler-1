            "answer": "So familiar! The first thing to have done is get your blood pressure checked, your blood sugars (for diabetes) and your cholesterol levels.\u00a0\u00a0I've suffered from migraines for over 26 years and that part is hereditary but when I went for invitro fertilization, the hormone injections sent me into a tailspin. I'm now allergic to hundreds of things.\u00a0\u00a0Digressing.... aside from getting lots of blood work done, go to an allergy specialist and find out what foods may be setting you off. My biggest trigger is food colouring, tartric acid/tartrazine, and sulphates.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately for me, and perhaps you, these three items are in 19 of 20 products.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck and wishing you good health!",

            "answer": "I've been to my doctor many times lately and my blood pressure is always good, as is all of my routine blood work.\u00a0\u00a0I have hypothyroidism, but it is controlled with medication.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor did ask me if I have any allergies, but did not elaborate on it or order any allergy testing (I have a sister and a son with SEVERE food allergies).\u00a0\u00a0Honestly, my biggest concern is the changes in the brain MRI.\u00a0\u00a0I've dealt with headaches and fatigue for years, but there's just something different about how I feel now.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully, the neurologist will be able to give me some answers (other than the usual \"it's all in your head\" - though in this case, I guess it may be - ha, ha).",

    "question": "I don't really know where to post my question, or where to begin with my symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I have suffered from migraine headaches for several years, but lately have experienced a different type of headache.\u00a0\u00a0These are usually on the right side of my head, and when I have one it literally feels like my right eye is drawing down.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to the headaches, I have been having some problems with my balance -\u00a0\u00a0I seem to weave and wobble to the right - especially in dimly lit or darkened rooms, and I am always SO TIRED.\u00a0\u00a0I had an MRI of my brain which showed 3 areas of increased signal (1 at the right medial temporal lobe, and 2 at the right basal ganglia).\u00a0\u00a0An MRI in 2004 showed only 1 area of increased signal, and based on some of my medical records, I apparently had an MRI in 2003 which was slightly abnormal, though I don't remember that one.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, my family physician, who I believe thinks I'm a hypochondriac with a depressive disorder, doesn't feel there is any reason for me to be concerned about the change in the MRI from 3 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0To pacify me, though, she has referred me to a neurologist, who I can't get in to see until the end of September.\u00a0\u00a0Do any of these symptoms sound familiar?\u00a0\u00a0I've also been experiencing chest pain/tightness and shortness of breath for the past few months (another reason my MD thinks I'm simply suffering from anxiety).\u00a0\u00a0Could this be related to any type of neurological problems?",
