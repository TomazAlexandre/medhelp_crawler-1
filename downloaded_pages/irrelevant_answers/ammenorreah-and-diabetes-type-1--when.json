            "answer": "Cinnabon,Since our endocrine system is a bit outa whack because of diabetes, our hormonal balances are likely more fragile than folks without diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I can't answer your question directly with a general rule, but I'll share my own experience with you.I was dx'd in my teen years -- I don't remember exactly my age, but I think I was ~15.\u00a0\u00a0My periods were irregular when they first started and then I went many months without one.\u00a0\u00a0I was tested for all sortsa stuff and finally given a Rx to cause my periods to start.\u00a0\u00a0It worked and I was on that med for at least a year.\u00a0\u00a0Looking back on it now, I'm sure it was a birth control pill.\u00a0\u00a0Once I stopped taking it, it took over a year for my periods to start again.\u00a0\u00a0They never did become \"regular\" until I was near 40!!Do your best to get your BG under stable control.\u00a0\u00a0Every step is worthwhile and gradually your body systems will find their balance again.\u00a0\u00a0Try to think of this as a marathon -- slow, steady forward movement.",

            "answer": "Cinnabon,THinking more about your question, I remember reading that many (Type 2, particularly) diabetic women are also susceptible to having PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) which has, among other symptoms -- loss of, or irregular periods.Here's a website with info:http://www.pcosupport.org/medical/whatis.phpThe \"what is PCOS\" link there will help you figure out if your symptoms match well enough to raise this with your endo.\u00a0\u00a0Read to the end of that section & there's a \"quiz\" to help individuals assess their symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0They interpret the score along the lines of how likely it is that you're experiencing PCOS or something else.PCOS is not the only potential cause, and it is not uncommon among diabetic women.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck -- this does seem like a good \"talk to your doc\" opportunity.\u00a0\u00a0If you're not comfy talking to him/her about this type of thing and/or your DM control in general, perhaps you can find another doctor.\u00a0\u00a0It's so important we find one who's working WITH us thru these difficult challenges of managing diabetes.",

            "answer": "I didn't have regular periods for all my teen years, and into my twenties (I was diagnosed at 12). After reading this, I guess I now have a possible answer. Since being in better control, and having 2 children everything kicked into rhythm. I love the marathon analogy.",
