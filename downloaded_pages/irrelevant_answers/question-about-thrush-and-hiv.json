            "answer": "I detect a note of panic in your note.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that I can help out.Thrush is an overgrowth of yeast that are normally present in and on all of our bodies.\u00a0\u00a0The yeast typically are on mucosal surfaces such as the mouth and throat and, for women, the vagina.\u00a0\u00a0This occurs when something happens that allows the yeast that are normally present to overgrow and cause symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0The are many possible causes and actually overall very few of all people with thrush have HIV and, when they do, it is advanced HIV which they have had for years. Of the causes we recognize (there are many cases of thrush which occur for reasons that we just don't fully understand), the most common is when people are taking antibiotics which then affect the bacteria normally present on these surfaces, thereby allow the yeast to overgrow.\u00a0\u00a0Another common situation is in diabetes when the high amounts of sugar in people's blood set the stage for yeast to overgrow.\u00a0\u00a0In HIV, as the virus causes deterioration of immunity , after years of doing so, thrush also increases.As I have said before, the presence of thrush is not a reason for someone to worry about HIV, and certainly not about the ARS, unless there are other considerations.Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0EWH",

            "answer": "Thank you Doctor. Yes there was a note of panic. I am male and I performed oral on two men 3-4-5 weeks ago). Last week I\u00a0\u00a0noticed on the inside of my cheeks little white bumps...no pain. I took a home access test last thursday which was four weeks from my furtherest exposure. It was negative, but I am still nervous as a cat on a hot tin roof. The bumps contue to remain (no worse or better.)",

            "answer": "\"other considerations\" are your risk status and likelyhood of infection.\u00a0\u00a0As for that, the bumps you have noted are not due to HIV.\u00a0\u00a0I would bet a lot of money that you do not have HIV.\u00a0\u00a0 The risk of getting HIV from performance of oral sex is estimated to be less than 1 in 10,000 if your partner is infected and we believe that estimate is likely too high.\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, unless your partners were men who have sex with other men or IV drug users, the odds are very, very low that they had HIV.\u00a0\u00a0You cannot get HIV if your partners are not infected.My advice.\u00a0\u00a0Stop worrying.\u00a0\u00a0If you cannot, you need to see a health care provider ofr evaluation so that you can set your mind at rest.\u00a0\u00a0EWH",

    "question": "In your forum you state that thrush is not usually a symptom of early infection (ARS).My question is do we know why it does show as a symptom in some people? That is, is there a reason such as an already compromised immune system? One article I read stated the virile load plays as much a part in thrush as an early symptom as does cd count.Are there other accompanying symptoms with the thrush when it does occur during ars?",
