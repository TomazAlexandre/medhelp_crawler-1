    "question": "Today/yesterday was my due date (the 17th). My husband and I have been trying to induce labor naturally for a few days and I've been having contractions but they are always inconsistent and never progress. It's super frustrating it's like my body is teasing me. Maybe I just can't go into labor myself for some reason. Anyways my doctors appointment is Friday and they are going to set an induction date because they won't let me go past 41 weeks because of my gestational diabetes. I'm guessing it will be set for Monday. Till then I'm going to try and induce myself because I want to go natural no epidural and I know the pitocin makes labor way more painful. But im telling myself i can still do it. Every time I shift in bed I feel like my bones are breaking and I just want him here!I've hadLoose stoolContractions/some painfulNauseaI was able to sleep longer then I've slept in a while last nightA LOT of pressureIncrease in dischargeBaby has dropped some but not fully1cm 60% effaced -3 station as of last FridayPraying it happens soon!",
