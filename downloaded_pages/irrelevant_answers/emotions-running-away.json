Spend the evening face down in the pillow, if that is what you need..That is the thing about ttc.. the MANY ups and downs... when you are feeling better, try to focus on opportunity ahead of you.. There is a baby out there waiting for you.. and it WILL happen.. keep believing that..\u00a0\u00a0Not as fast as you would have liked and maybe not the way you had always planned it, but it WILLl happen.",
