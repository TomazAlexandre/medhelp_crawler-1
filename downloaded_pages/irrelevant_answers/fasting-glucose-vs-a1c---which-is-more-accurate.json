Home meters are plus/minus 20%. Could apply to doctor's equipment too.\"the doctor assumed we had eaten something before the fasting test\"Possible something you ate the night b4 - high starch, high carbs, dairy - affected your liver which in turn produced glucose. This applies to your mother's varied levels. Fasting means NO food NO colored liquids for 8-10 hours prior to testing. Plain water is OK, nothing else. A fasting or an OGTT [oral glucose test] are the first level of tests. When your numbers are high or low the doctor verifies with an A1c.\u00a0\u00a0Bottom line, don't worry unless the A1c is near or above 6%.",

With that in mind, I don't understand the urgency [3 months] for retesting when both A1c's are very normal. Normal means an annual A1c test [once a year] if not every two years [No fasting test needed or required during this time period]. I'd question the doc's reason/motive.",

            "answer": "The business about \"not renewing meds\" unless you see the doctor frequently is not because the doctor wants to milk you of money. It is standard practice, because diabetic medications can cause death of accidents if improperly used. Often, with some diabetic medications, such as Novalog, the physician will not renew the prescription unless you are a much tighter leash. I doubt the physician's lab results are incorrect. These tests are standardized, relatively straightforward, and usually fairly accurate wherever they are taken.",
