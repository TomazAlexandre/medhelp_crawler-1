            "answer": "I had to take the 3 hour after failing the one hour. Its really not as bad as it sounds. You have to fast for 12 hours before. They will take your blood when you arrive (fasting blood sample) once that comes back good they'll have you drink the glucola and then an hour after that draw again, and then again an hour after that and so on and so forth. 4 blood samples total. You'll do fine!",

            "answer": "Yeah everything came back fine! I was really nervous too but try not to be, don't want to stress your little one out over nothing! Its very common for people to fail the first and pass the three hour. I wouldn't worry about it. Just make sure you follow all the directions they give you! Good luck!",
