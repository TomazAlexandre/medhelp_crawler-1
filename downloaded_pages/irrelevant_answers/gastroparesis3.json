            "answer": "What's interesting about the acupuncture/gastroparesis 'connection' is the gastric pacemaker is partially based on the principle of the acupuncture points that are used to help treat symptoms of gastroparesis by acupuncturists. There are two specific acupuncture points that relay to specific areas in the stomach and the acupuncture points are known to help stimulate digestive motor movements. In many cases the use of acupuncture is known to help those with gastroparesis - in a manner similar to what might be done by the gastric pacemaker. The location of the motor stimulus of the gastric pacemaker is suggested to be placed at the input areas the acupuncture sites 'feed' to.",
