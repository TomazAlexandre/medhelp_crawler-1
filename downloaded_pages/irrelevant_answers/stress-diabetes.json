            "answer": "I copied this info for you from endocrinweb.comCauses of Type 1 DiabetesType 1 Diabetes usually develops due to an autoimmune disorder. This is when the body's immune system behaves inappropriately and starts seeing one of it's own tissues as foreign. In the case of Type 1 Diabetes, the islet cells of the pancreas that produce insulin are seen as the \"enemy\" by mistake. The body then creates antibodies to fight the \"foreign\" tissue and destroys the islet cells ability to produce insulin.\u00a0\u00a0 The lack of sufficient insulin thereby results in diabetes. It is unknown why this autoimmune diabetes develops. Most often it is a genetic tendency. Sometimes it follows a viral infection such as mumps, rubella, cytomegalovirus, measles, influenza, encephalitis, polio or Epstein-Barr virus. Certain people are more genetically prone to this happening although why this occurs is not know.\u00a0\u00a0Thus, two people may be infected with the same virus and only one of them who is genetically prone will go on to develop diabetes. Other less common ( very rare) causes of Type 1 Diabetes include injury to the pancreas from toxins, trauma, or after the surgical removal of the majority (or all) of the pancreas.Type 2 Diabetes is more common than Type 1 Diabetes.Whereas Type 1 Diabetes was characterized by the onset in young persons (average age at diagnosis = 14), Type 2 Diabetes usually develops in middle age or later.\u00a0\u00a0This tendency to develop later in life has given rise to the term \"adult onset diabetes\". The typical Type 2 Diabetes patient is overweight although there are exceptions. In contrast to Type 1 Diabetes, symptoms often have a more gradual onset. Type 2 Diabetes is associated with insulin resistance rather than the lack of insulin like seen in Type 1 Diabetes. This often is obtained as a hereditary tendency from one's parents. Insulin levels in these patients are usually normal or higher than average but the body's cells are rather sluggish to respond to it. This lack of insulin activity results in higher than normal blood glucose levels.",
