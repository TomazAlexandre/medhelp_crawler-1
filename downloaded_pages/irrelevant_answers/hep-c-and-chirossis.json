            "answer": "Yes the chronic infection of the hepatitis C virus causes inflammation of the liver which leads to healthy liver cells being replaced by fibrous tissue. This fibrosis, over a period of 20 + years, can lead to stage 4 liver disease. Commonly called cirrhosis of the liver. Cirrhosis of the liver leads to many other systematic body system problems and some can be life-threatening. If the cause of the damage to the liver can't be stopped (in this case hepatitis C cured) before the cirrhosis becomes irreversible the patient will experience liver failure or liver cancer. Both of these can be fatal if a liver transplant can't be performed in time.Hepatitis C is the leading cause for liver transplants in the US. Most transplant patients are in their 50s and 60s having been infected for many decades without be aware that they were infected. The reason many of us try to cure our hepatitis C is so we don't end up with decompensated cirrhosis, End-Stage Liver Disease, liver failure or liver cancer.hector",

            "answer": "Hep C can cause liver disease, it is not the only cause of cirrhosis.http://www.liverfoundation.org/abouttheliver/info/cirrhosis/What causes cirrhosis?Cirrhosis is caused by chronic (long-term) liver diseases that damage liver tissue. It can take many years for liver damage to lead to cirrhosis.Chronic AlcoholismChronic alcoholism is the leading cause of cirrhosis in the United States. Drinking too much alcohol can cause the liver to swell, which over time can lead to cirrhosis. The amount of alcohol that causes cirrhosis is different for each person.Chronic Viral HepatitisChronic hepatitis C is the second leading cause of cirrhosis in the United States. Hepatitis C causes the liver to swell, which over time can lead to cirrhosis. About one in four people with chronic hepatitis C develop cirrhosis. Chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis D also can cause cirrhosis.Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)Fat build up in the liver that is not caused by alcohol use, is nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH can cause the liver to swell and can lead to cirrhosis. People with NASH often have other health issues including diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol, coronary artery disease and poor eating habits.Bile Duct DiseaseBile duct disease limits or stops bile from flowing to the small intestine. The bile backs up in the liver causing the liver to swell and can lead to cirrhosis. Two common bile duct diseases are primary schlerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis.Genetic diseasesSome genetic diseases can lead to cirrhosis. These diseases include Wilson disease, hemochromatosis, glycogen storage diseases, Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and autoimmune hepatitis.",
