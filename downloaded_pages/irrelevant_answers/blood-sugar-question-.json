    "question": "Once i went to the emergency, they took my glucose and as the result was 120 ( and they told that i can be pre diabetes). My reason to going to emergency room was high blood pressure ( not high sugar in the blood).But i ate 1 banana before giving the blood test, i was waited in emergency for 5 hours and was extremely tired and hungry. ( but i`m not sure). ( Not Fasting)The next time when i was giving Blood Test i had blood sugar 95. ( not fasting)But i tested 1 time my blood sugar as fasting:The first time was 89Right know i tested my blood sugar 2-3 hours after light meal ( vegetables) my sugar was 80.The reason why i`m checking my blood sugar is that i had a stress\u00a0\u00a0some period of time and after i started to feel sweaty palms and legs symptoms.",
