            "answer": "Thank you and thanks for replying. I have decided to go with a different hospital but the one I went to first time around is the only one close round that has the early pregnancy clinic so had no choice but to go there.I just feel like they should be giving me an early scan and not waiting until I'm 12 weeks.You're right, I do need to stay positive. That's what I keep telling myself.",

            "answer": "In New Zealand when we find out we are pregnant we go for what they call a \"dating scan\" its where they tell you exactly how far along you are. I had one at 7 weeks and my sister is a week behind me so had hers at 6 weeks.... I dont believe there is a specific time to have one.. If you want one go get it girl",

    "question": "I sadly lost my baby boy, Leo at 35+5 weeks in December 2015. I was in hospital, just about to be induced when his heart rate went down and stopped. I had been in hospital for 2 days (baby was perfectly healthy when I went in) before we lost him. I was kept in due to having pre eclampsia, diabetes and an underactive thyroid.I found out on Friday that were expecting our second baby (roughly about 5/6 weeks). Although I'm exited, I'm also extremely nervous.I've heard other people saying they're having early pregnancy scans after a miscarriage or problems with previous pregnancies. I've called the hospital and they've said they probably won't give me one because all my problems last time happened in the later stages. As far as I'm aware now, my first scan will be my 12 week scan. Is that right?I still have diabetes (mine wasn't gestational) and an underactive thyroid.The hospital messed up last time and have admitted negligence, I don't know who to trust.Thanks",
