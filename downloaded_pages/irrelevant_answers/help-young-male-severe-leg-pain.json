            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Pain can be due to nerve compression, peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes, anemia, low Vit D, low calcium, deep vein thrombosis and due to fibromyalgia. Compartment syndrome is another possibility when the muscle becomes too big for the sheath that covers it. In all these cases proper blood does not reach the muscle, which tightens up to protect itself.The clue to right treatment is right diagnosis of the cause of pain.\u00a0\u00a0You can consult an orthopedic specialist or a sports medicine specialist.\u00a0\u00a0Take care!",

    "question": "I am a young athlete(I run track). Ever since I began running since the 7th grade I have been diagnosed with shin splints. In the 7th grade I had a bone scan and was actually diagnosed with stress fractures.I am now in the 11th grade(4 years later) and the track conditioning will begin next month. NOTE: I have not run since beginning of august, it is now october).So I go for a jog at the park. The very second step I took the muscle on the outer side of the shin tightened up instantly and it felt like a sore pain such as how you would feel if you just got done weight lifting the day before. I finished my 2 mile jog and the pain stayed with me the whole time. This was just last week. Just today I wanted to test my leg again.So I decided to go outside and do 1 legged hops in place in my driveway. As soon as I pushed off the ground I felt the pain, I continued to do this for a full minute to see if the pain went away but it didnt.So can any doctor out there diagnose me with this problem? My mom refuses to take me to the doctor anymore seeing as my pain doesn't go away. I must know the problem or have an idea before I can consult my physician again.Another note to be almost exactly the pain I feel is just above the ankle but below the calf. not in the back of the leg but in the front outer muscle along the shin. And I'm almost completely sure it's not shin splints or stress fractures. ( I havn't been running in 3 months and its pure muscle pain)",
