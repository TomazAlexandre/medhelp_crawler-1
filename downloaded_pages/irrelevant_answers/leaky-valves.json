            "answer": "I don't think that a Doctor would confuse a hole with a leaky valve because the sound of leaky valves is very distinct. I suppose it all depends on the experience of your Doctor and the hole would have to be significant to produce a sound. I am confused why they are not doing an ultrasound to obtain far more information. If the EKG shows abnormalities they will request this anyway, so why not go straight for the better option to save time.",

    "question": "Hi, I had surgery for Atrial Septal Defect in 1984 when I was 20, and was told at the time that I had 2 weak valves and would need to advise a dentist before doing dental work so I could have antibiotics. Since hole was small they repaired with stiches and was told possible would need it again in late 40s. I am now 47 and going for a ekg in 2 weeks because doctor heard leaky valves. Could the hole come open again causing this? and Could this cause recently higher bp (until this year not noted for high bp). sorry long question",
