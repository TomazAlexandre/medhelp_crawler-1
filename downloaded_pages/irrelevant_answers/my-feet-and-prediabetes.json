            "answer": "Hi Hoarse,have to agree with you about not many people asking - considering the magnitude of the problem.If the pain is an aching type pain, I would say it is probably unrelated to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0IF the pain is a burning type pain, well this can be due to the nerve damage that high blood sugars bring.\u00a0\u00a0But then your blood sugars are not so high and you are well under control.I think you should assess the shoes you are wearing and how much support they give your feet.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe also do some foot exercises to help strengthen them, including walking bare foot, if your floor is suitable.\u00a0\u00a0You can find info on foot exercises online.\u00a0\u00a0A good podiatrist / physiotherapist can assess your foot alignment and gait and may be able to give good inputs.A foot massager (it is electronic and has a roller) may help, or even a foot spa that bubbles a lot may be helpful.Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "I can tell you from my own experience that top quality shoes make all of the difference in the world!\u00a0\u00a0Ever since I had to start buying my own shoes, I have been looking for ways to save money.\u00a0\u00a0This included buying real cheap shoes (horrible idea) or by finding shoes at a discounted price.\u00a0\u00a0What ends up happening is, you end up going through numerous pairs of shoes, spending far more money than you would have if you bought GOOD shoes.I wear Red Wing work boots.\u00a0\u00a0Absolute heaven.\u00a0\u00a0I am up and down, all around on my feet all day.\u00a0\u00a0My feet never hurt when I wear good shoes.Seeing a doctor is always a preferred option.\u00a0\u00a0They can evaluate your stride, your step and discover that it may be something \"mechanical\" in the way you walk.... or, they may find that your shoes are not reasonable.I don't mean to pump any specific brand, but Red Wings are my savior.\u00a0\u00a0They cost around 200 dollars but I will be able to wear them for 2 years.\u00a0\u00a0In that time I would normally wear out 6-7 pair of $40 dollar shoes, and, good shoes are often rebuildable and that will offer savings on the other end of your purchase.\u00a0\u00a0Instead of having to go spend an additional $200, you can send them back and have them rebuilt for about $130 and they feel brand new!Good shoes... well worth the money!!!",

    "question": "So a lot of you guys have read my posts in the last few months on here.\u00a0\u00a0Sadly the prediabetes community is not a very active one.\u00a0\u00a0No pun intended.With 1/3 of America being prediabetic, I would expect more folks would be wanting answers on here.\u00a0\u00a0More support for me, I guess.Anyway, for the past few months my feet have hurt a lot.\u00a0\u00a0Always at the end of the day, and rarely but sometimes in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is present even when I don't do much in the day.I have been eating right for two months now, and exercising a lot more recently.\u00a0\u00a0Already lost 15-20lbs.\u00a0\u00a0But my feet still ache at the end of the day.My wife massages them, and as soon as she touches them it's like instant relief.\u00a0\u00a0I mean, it's amazing how little she has to rub before I feel fine again.\u00a0\u00a0But I can't have my wife do this every night.\u00a0\u00a0To make it fair for her we have invented the \"Feet 69.\"\u00a0\u00a0We rest in bed facing up, but our heads at opposite ends of the bed and we take one foot and begin to rub away.So, can this be prediabetes related?\u00a0\u00a0I also wear tight socks during the day but idk.",
