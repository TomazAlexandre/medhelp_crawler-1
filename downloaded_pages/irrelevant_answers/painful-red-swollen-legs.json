            "answer": "You have my sympathies.You have phlebitis.If you have congestive heart failure cutting down on salt is desirable.You might want to get a vascular consult. This specialist will probably order what is called a color dopplar of the leg.You have a very serious and complex condition, and must pay close attention to the treatment regimen your physician prescribes. Take all the medications in exactly the manner prescribed.I am a little concerned because you don't seem to be communicating with your physician. This is not always the patient's fault. It's easy to say, but give thought to either finding another physician or getting his nurse or PA to take the time to explain your condition, the outlook and the treatments.Drinking ice-water should cause no problem.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Usually conditions of heart, kidney, liver or low protein or severe anemia, which cause leg swelling cause both legs to swell. Hence you will need to get heart function assessed by ECHO and EKG (an assessment to see if you are not in failure now), get kidney and liver function tests done and get a complete blood picture for anemia. Low sodium in blood, hypothyroidism and malabsorption syndromes causing low protein in blood have to be looked into.Apart from this deep vein thrombosis and inflammation of veins or phlebitis should be looked into. It can also be infection of skin or cellulitis. Hence get the diabetes status checked.The best thing would be to consult a general practitioner or PCP and try and assess what is the cause of your problem. Then proper referral for concerned specialist can take things further and get you proper treatment. Take care!",
