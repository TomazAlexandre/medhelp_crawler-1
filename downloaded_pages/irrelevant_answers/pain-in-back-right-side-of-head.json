            "answer": "Hi Roxie,Welcome to MedHelp's Pain Management Community. I am glad that you found us and took the time to post.Have you consulted your PCP? Have you been offered any diagnosis or had any imaging, scans or tests performed? That information would be helpful to those of us that are responding to your question.If I had a sharp shooting pain in the back of my head I would be concerned. I suggest that you consult your PCP if you haven't already done so. We have lots of vessels in our brain and I would want to make sure that they are all healthy.You might also want to have your cervical area examined. A structural issue of your cervical spine could account for your pain. There is no good reason to suffer with undiagnosed pain and I sincerely hope that you will have this investigated. Please be safe.Please keep in touch and let us know how you are doing. I will look forward to hearing additional information...and to learn about your PCP opinion.Best of Luck to You,~Tuck",
