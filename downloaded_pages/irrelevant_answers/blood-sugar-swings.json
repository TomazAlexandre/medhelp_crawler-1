            "answer": "Tables?? Yes, I agree, that sounds indicative of diabetes. You need to see your doctor ASAP and get an A1C which tests an average blood sugar for a couple month. But be sure and tell your doctor about the lows because they could skew the average. When you are that low you need some fast acting carbs such as a glass of orange juice to bring your numbers up. But mostly you need to see the doctor and get a diagnosis and treatment. Diabetes is a manageable condition, but the longer it goes uncontrolled the more likely complications.",

            "answer": "Roller coaster blood sugar swings can and do make you feel weird. Ideally, you want your sugar to be on a more even keel. You did not mention if you are on medication for your diabetes, or insulin or just diet control. You really have to watch those carbs, they will raise your blood sugar pretty quickly. Speak with a nutritionist and/or diabetes consultant to get a good idea of a healthy diet to follow. Regardless of whether or not you are on medications, you will have to be in firm control of your diet for the rest of your life. Exercise is also a must. The more you exercise the healthier you will be. Burn off some calories and your blood sugar will drop a bit as well. Drink plenty of water. Give your body every chance you can to be a healthy body...it's the only one you have! Good luck!",
