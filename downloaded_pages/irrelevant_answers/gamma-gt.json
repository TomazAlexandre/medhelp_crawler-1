            "answer": "I would not immediately jump to the conclusion that your fatty liver is from alcohol use. It may be or alcohol may have contributed but fatty liver is also seen in non-obese patients who do not drink.I think it would be wise to stop drinking alcohol and try to construct a diet that your doctor thinks will be beneficial.There is also recent evidence that a drug used to treat diabetes may be very beneficial in the non-diabetic population. I don't have access to the study right now but if you message me and remind me I will get it to you.Don't panic by any means. A lot of people have mild fatty liver and live long an healthy lives so relax a little.Mike",
