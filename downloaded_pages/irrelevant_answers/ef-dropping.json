            "answer": "Hi, understand your anxiety. If medical therapy fails, cardiac transplantation is recommended for all eligible patients with an LVEF below 20%\u00a0\u00a0regardless of clinical symptoms.

Patients with heart failure have a 5-year mortality rate approaching 50 percent in some studies. Regards.",
