            "answer": "I found out last week I have gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I was freaked out. Dont be nervous. Its isnt as bad as the internet can make it sound. You will be put on a meal plan which will just mean you have to watch what you eat. And you will have to check your blood sugar. But dont freak out. It will be ok. There is a chance of you baby being bigger but if you eat healthy and exercise it helps control it. Good luck on your 3 hour test. Dont worry about it bc the stress and anxiety can also raise your blood sugar. Good luck.",
