            "answer": "Hi Stephanie,sorry to hear about your insurance problems. We all know how tough it is to take care of our diabetes without proper insurance or finances. Are you still able to see your doctor despite the insurance loss? Maybe others on this forum can give you more precise information or advice on how to go about obtaining free supplies. My suggestion at this point is to speak to your doctor or check with a diabetic clinic at your local hospital. Perhaps they could help point you in the right direction. Do you qualify for Medicaid or any other type of insurance you'd be able to afford? Sorry I couldn't be more of a help. I hope things will work out and you'll be able to continue taking care of your diabetes the best way possible.Take care.",

            "answer": "I would suggest you try to get insurance even if it is thru Medicaid.\u00a0\u00a0When you do get insurance you will most likely have a pre existing clause which means that they will not pay for at least 1 year even when you get insurance.",
