            "answer": "Hello,They seem like boils or furuncle. Boils are caused by infection of the hair follicle by staph aureus. . Hair follicles that are blocked by greasy creams, petroleum jelly, or similar products are more vulnerable to infection. Bacterial skin infections can be spread by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close human contact, or by contact with pus from a boil or carbuncle.Treatment includes antibiotics and pls do not touch or pick them up.Recurrent boils are found in diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune system disorders.So pls get your blood sugar evaluated.Other possibility is of swollen lymph nodes. . Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) is usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection . In some cases, over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers and warm compresses may be all you need. For more serious cases, treatment of swollen lymph nodes involves treating the underlying cause usually infections.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep us posted on how you are doing.",
