            "answer": "It could be the extra blood flow down there that causes it to feel a little more full than usual (sounds dodgy when I put it like that haha) but if you find it becoming really uncomfortable or painful see a doctor. His penis won't be able to touch baby who is nice and snug in your belly. X",

    "question": "I just started into my 15th week today. My fiance and I have been having sex quite often and I have noticed during the past couple of weeks that something is kind of uncomfortable that wasn't before. It's only when we do it missionary style, but it feels like he's hitting something up there, and it kinda hurts a little. I don't mind it, but I'm worried that it may be something that could hurt the baby or endanger it. I may just be paranoid, as I have never been pregnant and was told I couldn't even have kids due to my type one diabetes. If anyone knows what's going on, any info would be much appreciated!",
