            "answer": "Hi,I'm sorry to hear your not feeling well. Believe me, better days are ahead.You've several symptoms that could be symptomatic of MS, but they could also be caused by other things. It sounds like your doctor is taking a normal approach to things. Shes getting you in to see a neuro which often times takes forever. I would expect that between now and then if things get bad your PCP will get you in.The neuro will do a standard exam, and probably will order some blood work to rule out a few possible things. A lot will depend on your MRI results. If there are lesions, then your neuro will certainly order more testing given that you have had some odd neurological issues. Don't \"expect\" that your neuro is going to look at the MRI and tell you whats going on. Thats the exception. A huge exception. Most neuro's I have seen don't venture much information until they are ready to make some kinda of diagnosis.Could this just be Diabetes? Not sure. I have no idea how diabetes manifests itself. Until recently I had no idea how MS manifested itself, but you learn things pretty quickly when it sounds serious and they mention it as a probable cause of your not feeling well. I am not diagnosed with MS but have a lot of the symptoms. I am working towards finding the cause of my condition regardless of where it takes me. Like me, you know your not feeling right and you would like to know what's causing it. Diabetes or MS? Who knows. It could be a pinched nerve in your spin or any number of things.I don't want to discourage you, but you wanted to know if you can speed this up and you can't. Appointments take time, getting the right tests done take time, getting back in to see the neuro takes time, more tests. I would expect that you might, if you push, find out whats going on within a year. It can take 10-15 years sometimes.What you can and must do is to be your own advocate. If you have numbness or pain get in and make them find out whats going on. Sometimes PCP may not think there is anything much going on. I complained that my right leg hurt and arm had numbness for 3 years before getting in to see a neuro. I had to complain forcefully with my PCP that we were not trying to find the answers and I was sick of feeling this way. Stay on them to keep digging.Keep a time line. A note book with month/year, you don't need specific days, but note times when your note feeling well, how you felt and if it impacted your normal routine. Arm numb, can't vacuum today.Where are you from? Specifically, where did you live ages 1-12? MS is much more predominant in people that grew up in Northern climates. It still strikes all areas, but strangely those in the North are far more likely to develop it.I'm going to let others say hello. You keep us updated on how your feeling and whats going on. There are a lot of good people around here, helpful and supportive. There is a retired pediatrician. She has a wealth of knowledge and she will certainly say hello soon. Until then, keep smiling.Johnny",

    "question": "I was feeling numbness and tingling on the right side of my face R/ hand and R/foot, I went to the ER because I could not handle it anymore.\u00a0\u00a0The Attending Physican, requested an Chest X-ray Imperssion: Negative Examination. Ct Head or Brain w/o contrast Impression Essentially negative Noncontrast ct head. I had an abnormal ECG.\u00a0\u00a0She ordered an MRI of the brain.\u00a0\u00a0Impression 1. Sinusitis, 2. Puntctate areas of increased signal in the white matter. Multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating processes would be a consideration.Findings: were as follows:\u00a0\u00a0There is a mild mucoscla thickening throughtout the partially visualized paranasal sinuses consistant with an element of sinusitis. Ventricles are normal in size, shape and postition. No mass effect, midline shift of hyrocephalus. There are two punctate areas of increased signal in the white matter in the right hemisphere as seen on the FLAR images.\u00a0\u00a0One is just superior and lateral to the right lateral ventricle and the other is lateral to the mid portion of the right lateral ventricle. There are also evident on the T2-wieghed inages but are more conspicious on the FLAR images. Diffusion -weighted images reveal no evidence of the acute ischemic process. No specific abnormality on the T1 images. THe punctate areas of increased signal in the white matter are nonspecific. Multiple sclerosis, however remains a consideration.\u00a0\u00a0There are not uncommon in patients over 50 years of age. In patients under 50 years of age, in the absence of underlying hypertension, diabetes or other small vessel disease, multiple scleriosis would be the most likely etiology.My dr. stated that she was surpised that the ER dr had ordered the MRI, but in my case she was glad it was done.\u00a0\u00a0Should I be scared?I follow up with my Dr. she stated did anthor ECG which came out normal.\u00a0\u00a0She also order me to do a 2 hr gluclose test which I did this morning. She has also referred me to Neurologist for evaluation and treatment.I have been having a lot of diffuclties with my feet and legs and my right hand, Could this just be Diabetes?Also I scheduled an appointment with the Nueorologist however they can not get me in until Nov 20,2007.\u00a0\u00a0What happens until then I continue to have good days and bad days?From what I have provided you with, and your experience can you please advise your opionion, Am I dealing with MS. I am a 30 year hispanic female who is very active and always on the go, and have been really healthy until now I am unable to do much now I am always very tired, it is so hard for me to get out of bed?\u00a0\u00a0Is there anything I can do to get this process speeded up/or can you tell me what and where I go for here?Thank you so much for your time.",
