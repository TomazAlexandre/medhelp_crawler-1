            "answer": "My regular endo takes pediatric thyroid patients.\u00a0\u00a0Don't limit yourself to a pediatric endo - most of them are dealing with pediatric diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Call and find a good thyroid specialist endo then talk to the nurse (a secret to getting around the receptionist) about your daughter's condition - that may get you in faster.Starting her on Synthroid isn't a bad idea now but she needs long-term followup with an endo.\u00a0\u00a0While her primary care doctor is starting this, did they do an ultrasound of your daughter's thyroid or just determine the multinodular goiter through palpitation?\u00a0\u00a0If she hasn't had an ultrasound, she needs one.",

    "question": "Okay, I'm really concerened about my daughter.\u00a0\u00a0She is 10 Yrs. old and just got diagnosed with a multinodular goiter and presents with an enlargment of her thyroid gland, one side being larger than the other.\u00a0\u00a0Also bloodwork shows elevated tsh level at 6.4(normal range is up to 5.5) t4 and t3 and thyroid antibodies came back with in all normal ranges.\u00a0\u00a0How long do you think this may have been developing?\u00a0\u00a0I'm just afraid that this is serious.\u00a0\u00a0She cannot get in to see the ped. Endo for a while and she is the only one within my insurance plan-so her primary wants to start her on synthroid immediatley.\u00a0\u00a0Do you think this is a good idea?\u00a0\u00a0I think maybe I should just wait for her to see the pediatric Endo.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know your expert opinion.\u00a0\u00a0I greatly appreciate it!!!Thanks",
