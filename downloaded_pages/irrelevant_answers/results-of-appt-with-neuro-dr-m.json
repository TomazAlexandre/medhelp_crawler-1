    "question": "Hi All,Back from Florida, wonderful vacation. Loved seeing my daughters' new home. Weather great, only one day of rain showers. The day before I left I had my follow up with Dr. M. after my MRI's. The results are in.....no evidence of MS in spinal cord, so NO MS. That's the good news. Dr. M attributes my muscle weakness, increased intensity in arms, to the cervical disk impinging on the spiinal cord. Due also to the lots of disk degeneration. The lthoracic disk is also causing problems. Dr. M does not treat these problems, so I'm released from his care unless I develop more neurological symptoms. He recommended I see my neuro-surgeon to evaluate my neck, and determine the treatment for that. He also gave me another perscription for the Baclophen, and recommended I stay on Lyrica for the neuropothy in my feet and legs, and for the nerve pain caused by the disks, and the fibromyalgia.While I'm greatly relieved I don't have MS, I still have to deal with the DDD, degenerative osteo-arthritis, type 2 diabetes, fibromyalgia, etc. My legs and back are really hurting after 14hr trip yesterday. The flying isn't too bad, but the 3 hour lay-overs in Atlanta and Salt Lake City nearly killed me. The standing around waiting is the pitts. Now back to PCP and neuro-surgeon for treatment. I really don't want another fusion on my neck, but it looks like I'm headed that way.It won't take much more, and I won't be able to drive for a living. Oh well, at least I'm able to work now, thank the Lord.I'm hoping you all had a good week while I was gone, will be reading to check up on you all.\u00a0\u00a0(((((((hugs))))))))) and thank yous for all your help, and the wonderful caring people you all are. Hopiing I can stay around and share my experiences towards diagnosis with anyone I can help.Maggie",
