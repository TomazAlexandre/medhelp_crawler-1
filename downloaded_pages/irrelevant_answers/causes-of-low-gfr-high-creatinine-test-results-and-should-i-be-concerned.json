            "answer": "One of the areas of research I am working in right now is the relationship/frequency of patients with MS, Lyme's, and FM, that also have MTHFR mutations (DNA).\u00a0\u00a0If you have the one or more of the MTHFR mutations it can markedly increase your MS issues.\u00a0\u00a0After reading through your list I noticed a number of overlay presentations leading me to wonder if you have ever been tested for the mutation I mentioned.Now, back to the question of your test results...Yes, dehydration can cause your numbers to be affected.\u00a0\u00a0With that said, I also noticed that you take Aleve for your pain. While Alive is a great pain medication (I use it myself), it requires that you drink plenty of water with it as it can make your kidneys work a little harder than normal. Here is a statement directly from the Package insert for Aleve (Naproxen): \"Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including Naproxen\".\u00a0\u00a0In many cases this can be solely from lack of water/fluid intake during use.Let me know if you have any questions about this post.",

            "answer": "Sorry Deb,I copied the wrong statement for Aleve, here is the correct one.\"Naproxen may impair the ability of the kidney to cope with low renal blood flow states due to inhibition of prostaglandin-dependent afferent arteriolar vasodilation. It is advised that water ingestion should be increased during use of Naproxen. Individuals with renal problems should avoid taking Naproxen (also know as Naprosyn).I hope this helps!",

            "answer": "Thanks for getting back with me.\u00a0\u00a0I am relieved to hear that possibly dehydration can affect the numbers.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe I was dehydrated the day of my MRI.\u00a0\u00a0If things turn out to be normal, I will ask them before they give me the Gladiolium what the numbers are because this sure has me concerned.I have participated in a research study of my genes because my sister also has MS, but I think it was a blind study.\u00a0\u00a0That is very interesting about your research.\u00a0\u00a0My sister has many of the same MS symptoms that I have, including very low vitamin D.\u00a0\u00a0My neurologist told me my girls should be taking vitamin D to prevent MS.",

It is possible I was taking this medicine and maybe even cold medicine at the time of my MRI because I had a severe cold.\u00a0\u00a0Your response did help...Thanks again!Deb",

    "question": "Hello, this is the first time to post in this forum.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 53 yr. old female with multiple sclerosis and is overweight, but not obese, a history of high blood pressure, but is under good control.I went in for an MRI before Thamksgiving which included enhancement.\u00a0\u00a0They do a screening for kidney problems prior to the MRI.\u00a0\u00a0I never know the results.\u00a0\u00a0They went ahead and did the test.\u00a0\u00a0To my surprise, this time the results were posted online, and they were abnormal (which wasn't shared with my doctor).The GFR a was 47 and the creatinine was 1.20.\u00a0\u00a0I wrote the doctor's office (MS Specialist) the nurse responded.\u00a0\u00a0She said I shouldn't be concerned.\u00a0\u00a0She said when I go in to see my GP at my yearly exam that I could mention this, if I wanted and that it wasn't a cause for alarm.\u00a0\u00a0She said it was probably dehydration.What would cause these abnormal tests?\u00a0\u00a0Can mild dehydration cause it?\u00a0\u00a0Should I be concerned?Besides MS, these things may seem relevant:1) night sweats2)\u00a0\u00a0shortness of breath (just started 2 days ago)3)\u00a0\u00a0can't sleep4) on a seizure medicine- a generic of Klonopin5) taking Provigil for fatigue6) low vitamin D (for quite some- said not unusual for people with MS), but is normal now with 3000 units of vit D daily7) history of many UTI due to problems emptying bladder thought to be from MS8) urinary incontinence from MS9) urinary retention (thought to be from MS)10) hypothyroidism11) father died at 72 this year from stroke (related to diabetes).\u00a0\u00a0My diabetes tests have been normal12) violently sick Sunday through Tuesday- well after tests results) with food poisoning (husband got same thing).\u00a0\u00a0Right side of my back hurt very badly.\u00a0\u00a0Took Aleve.\u00a0\u00a0I have a hint of an ache there now, but this shortness of breath and dizziness has been a concern.Should I be worried?\u00a0\u00a0I retiring this month and my retirement plan doesn't include caring for my husband if something was to happen to me to get my entire annuity (he's older than me and insisted to do it that way).\u00a0\u00a0I am torn on whether to.change the plan to include him getting monthly annuity checks if I die before it's too late which will significantly lower my annuity.This sounds crazy, I know, but I have a lot on my plate!\u00a0\u00a0I have only days from retirement.Thanks and sorry so longDeb",
