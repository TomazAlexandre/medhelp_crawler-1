            "answer": "\"My Ac1 was originally 5.7 and the last time it was checked it was 6.2.\u00a0\u00a0When I do a 2hr after eating test I'm ok.\"This is a puzzling statement. An A1c of 6.2%\u00a0\u00a0is equivalent to 131 mg/dl daily glucose average. Sometime during the day your levels are not OK, or your meter is need of calibration and/or test strips are not within their expiration period.\"I snack late and may eat nuts, yougurt, or sugar free coffee.\"During sleeping hours your liver and body fat releases stored glucose in expectation for the energy you need upon wakening. Bad snacks add to the stored glucose which in turn gets dumped. Make sense?Here lays most of your problem, late night snacking and weight control. Snacking on nuts before bedtime is OK but read the nutrition label carefully. Like yogurt and other carb laden snacks mfg's add sugar for flavor. This can come in refined sugar, cane sugar, corn syrup, or carb sugar, etc. Carb sugar means every 7 grams equals one heaping Tablespoon of refined sugar [nasty]. In reality there really isn't a need for late night snacking as you're only satisfying a mental craving. If temptation is too strong at least try not to snack 2-3 hours before bedtime.You can also do yourself a favor by losing some excess poundage. At 5' 3\" and 160 lb your BMI is 28.3, overweight. Weight loss and daily physical exercise helps a lot with lowering glucose levels. Good luck",

            "answer": "\" I haven't wanted to take Metformin because I did some research and many people have had liver damage from taking it.\"I don't know where you read this information from but it is untrue. As a liver transplant survivor all medication/supplements must first be cleared by my doctors. Metformin was cleared by my three liver transplant surgeons, two are head of their respective liver & kidney transplant centers. Since taking Metformin seven years ago, I get yearly liver biopsies and undergo every two months complete liver panel tests. My results are always normal and my liver is very normal and healthy too. If Metformin caused liver damage wouldn't you think it would have affected my liver by now?As far as your recent glucose levels, I feel if you lost the excess poundage and got into daily physical exercise you can get your levels back to normal. If you slack off, however, your glucose may continue to rise calling for upon the need of medication. Good luck",
