            "answer": "Both my babies were both with that. I don't think that its genetic. Mine was cause by my gestational diabetes I had while pregnant. Is he diabetic? I know my babies turned purple easy. They were lucky as it improved after birth. I had to keep having them tested week after week and watched the numbers go down. I wish your dad the best.",

            "answer": "Your welcome! I only had to take insulin while pregnant but I was type 2 diabetic until I had gastric bypass in 2005. There must be a connection. I need to check that out as well. I was on Metformin before my surgery. I am insulin resistant. Everything improved with the weight loss and now I am not on anything and am just fine. Best of luck with your dad.",
