            "answer": "You could have still gotten your first period while pregnant. That could be one reason why you may be further than you think. I'm not sure if they would do it, but if you think it may be gestational diabetes, maybe see if they will do the glucose test sooner that way you can alter your diet.",

            "answer": "1. U/S are plus or minus 2 lbs, so their measurements are not exact. They are a reasonable aprozimation.2. As much as OBs\u00a0\u00a0and sonogram tech like to claim they have all the information, everyone grows at a different rate. There is no 'correct' size at xyz gustation. That like saying all new borns need to be 6 lbs. There is a randge of normal. It sounds like your practioners are using fear tactics. They should be saying things along the lines of, 'your babies weight is estimated at X, which is 75 percentile for its gustation.'My family has never had a baby under 9.5 lbs in 70 years. It isn't that we have diabetes, it's that our genetics are we make big babies. For about 10 weeks, I measured 3-4 weeks ahead, but dates and tests came back fine. Thankfully my midwife was fine as long everything progressed well. I had a natural no intervention birth at 42 weeks. Our bodies know what they are doing, trust your body.",

            "answer": "Did you have a dating scan? Some women ovulate early, so this could make your baby older... By 20 weeks scans are much less accurate and can be a week or even 2 weeks off - that's why they don't use morphology scans to change your estimated due date. Gestational diabetes wouldn't normally grow your baby that much, It's more that babies get fatter with wider shoulders... Which is not really what they're measuring in a 20 week scan. Can't hurt to test early if you're worried, I just did... I'd rather know now if I need to change my diet. So not sure what's happening in your situation but could just be a mix of dating error, scan error and a bit bigger baby :)",

            "answer": "Thank you ladies. I'll talk to my doc abt getting checked but doubt it's my diet since I eat very healthy n I'm still running 3 miles every other day plus weight lifting 3 to 4 times a week. Maybe it's just my husband's genes. I'm 5 ft 1 n he is over 6 ft. He was a big baby also at 10 lbs when he was born.. but just to have peace of mind I'll ask to get tested early.",

This is my second gd baby and that's what my doc told me. Your probably ether a bit wrong on the dates or just having a big baby good luck",

    "question": "I'm 20 weeks and during my sonogram my doctor said the baby was much bigger then what it should be. He/she is measuring as if I was 23 weeks. I'm as absolutely sure of the date of my LMP so I'm sure my calculations are not wrong. I'm getting a bit concern of what it can mean because according to the Internet it might mean that I developed diabetes during pregnancy or that I might have to deliver via cesarean early if the baby gets too large. I've gained 8 lbs n barely started showing this week so I'm not sure where this huge baby is at.. has anyone had this problem?",
