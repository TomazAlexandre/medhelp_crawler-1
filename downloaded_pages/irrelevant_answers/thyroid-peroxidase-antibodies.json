            "answer": "Normally with those problems, you would expect that the best doctor to see would be an Endo; however, my experience is that most of them specialize in diabetes, not thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Also, many of them have the \"Immaculate TSH Belief\" and only want to test and treat by the TSH test.\u00a0\u00a0That does not work.\u00a0\u00a0If the Endo goes beyond TSH, the test will be for Free T4 and then \"Reference Range endocrinology\" will be used to determine if there is a problem.\u00a0\u00a0That also doesn't work because the reference ranges are far too broad to be functional for many hypo patients.What you need most is a good thyroid doctor.\u00a0\u00a0By that I mean one that will treat a hypo patient clinically, by testing\u00a0\u00a0and adjusting Free T3 and Free T4 (not the same as Total T3 and T4), as necessary to relieve symptoms, without being constrained by test results and especially not by resultant TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0I think I have one I can recommend in your area, but let me find out how long to get an appointment.\u00a0\u00a0Will get back to you as soon as I know.",
