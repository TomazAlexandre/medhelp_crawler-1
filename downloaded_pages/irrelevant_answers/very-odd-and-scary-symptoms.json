            "answer": "You gave a lot of \u201cstuff\u201d but lacking some information to work with, so let\u2019s take one thing at a time for clarification. Some of these you can do yourself, like search the Internet for an understanding, others you need to ask your doctor. If you feel you should be tested do not hesitate to ask. If he/she says no, ask for an explanation.Glucose [blood sugar]Equipment:1.\tLast time you calibrated your home meter?2.\tDo the test strips have an expiration date?3.\tKeep in mind Consumer Reports tested home glucose meters earlier this year and found only one make & model having consistent accurate readings.Testing:1.\tFasting [prandial] before meals means no food or colored liquids 8-10 hours prior to testing. This is why testing b4 breakfast is ideal.2.\tTest 2-3 hours after a meal\u00a0\u00a0[postprandial]when food glucose are at their highest level in your blood stream. This is the ideal times to test to see how well your body manages glucose. I aim for 2.5-3 hours.3.\tTesting prior to 2-3 hours you may get a false/positive reading since glucose is still on the rise.4.\tTesting after 3 hours glucose is on the decline.\u00a0\u00a0Again another false/positive reading.Glucose Levels:1.\tFasting:A.\t70-99 mg/dl is normal. Some labs are now saying 60-99 mg/dl is normal. Check with you doctor.B.\t100-124 mg/dl is considered prediabetesC.\t126 mg/dl and above is considered diabetes type 2D.\tIf your fasting levels fall below the low mark you may have diabetes type 1.E.\tIf your fasting levels are high but drop after meals you may be considered LADA [Latent Autoimmune Disease in Adults], also known as diabetes type 1.5. Your doctor may or may not be aware of how to diagnose or treat this. If he/she doesn\u2019t, get them to learn about this. It\u2019s all over the Internet.After Meal [postprandial]1.\tOptimum level with some labs is <180 mg/dl, others <140 mg/dl. [< means less than]. Your doctor will have his/her own expectations.Foot Problems:1.\tIf infection has been ruled out, often times attributed to out of control glucose levels [to low or too high]. This is called Neurothapy.Dizziness and Vision:1.\tDizziness may be attributed broadly to a number of things.a.\tTo low or too high glucose levels [diabetes]b.\tLow blood pressurec.\tHigh blood pressured.\tHeart condition [arrhythmia]e.\tBrain tumorf.\tBlood disorders [low oxygen, etc]g.\tDehydrationh.\tAnemiai.\tEndocrine disorder; thyroid, pancreas, etc.Leg Stiffness & Pain:1.\tThe list is very long, into the hundredshttp://symptoms.wrongdiagnosis.com/cosymptoms/leg-pain/stiffness.htm\u201ci am also on a medication that might but not likely could be causing all this\u201dWell, you failed to tell us what this is. Often times people assume their drugs are OK to mix with others, or ignore the drug[s] side effects. Have you checked with your local Pharmacist on drug interactions? This also includes vitamins and supplements. Take a complete list of all medications, vitamins and supplements to your Pharmacist and ask for a consultation. Be sure to include the dosage. In my area, consultations are free at no charge.Good luck.",

    "question": "this is very upsetting and frustrating to me because these are not clasic symptoms but possibly some are classic.i've had gestational diabetes 3 times and the last time, i ended up having to give my self insulin shots.my last pregnancy was almost 2 years ago. i am also on a medication that might but not likely could be causing all this and we have already ruled out lymes disease.it started a few months back with a lot of foot problems. sores, itching, pain. i thought it was athletes foot so i treated it as such but it didn't help and i started thinking just slightly about diabetes.well than there was a lull for a bit, until i started waking up in the morning with very stiff painful feet every morning. it made it hard to get out of bed.than i started having vision problems too. i can't seem to focus on anything for longer than 5 min stretches. even writing this now, i'm having issues. i start losing focus, than i get dizzy, than it forces me to shut my eyes and it feels like i might be dozing off.when i open my eyes, they are always refocused till the next time. this freaks me out cause i can't drive even without this happening.i have extreme fatigue like i've never seen before. anyways back to the stiff feet.about 2 weeks into those symptoms, the stiffness and pain has traveled to above my knees.my legs are chronically stiff and painful and its much worse after i rest them. even a 10 min trip in the car and i can barely move. now the stiffness has traveled into my fingers. not my hand, just the fingers. i have an appointment to see the\u00a0\u00a0doc on wed. anyways, i was telling a friend and she asked if i have diabetes. i honestly don't think my symptoms match those of a diabetic and so i'm hoping u guys will either say yes you've heard of similar stories or absolutely not.i have been checking my sugars with my meter and they are def out of wack but i'm hoping its wrong. 5 hours after eating my sugars were at 198 and in the morning its too low. in fact this afternoon 2 hours after eating they were still low, but than other times its way too high. out of 8 times i've checked, only once was it in range.so what does everyone think. thanks in advance to anyone who replys. i really need some answers. i was a tad concerned about ms as well because of the stiffness.",
