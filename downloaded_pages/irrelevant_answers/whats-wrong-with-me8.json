            "answer": "I have a son who has had the RSV 2 times the first bout was when he was 5 weeks old and he was on a vent for 11 days, the second time he was 2 1/2 and in the hospital for 5 days. he also has a lengthy cardiac history includong open heart surgery when he was 3 months old, he is now 4 years old. I understand about you not eating a lot it has to due in my opinion with your heart. he use to get tired when feeding he would only eat like 1 ounce every 4 hours. now if he eats too much which is more then a hot dog without any bread, then his little tummy gets bug (distended) and he vomits. it was the wya his tummy was formed as a baby.as far as your chest pains, I would think it would be more towards the stress you are encountering. I am assuming that since you have a cardiac history you are being followed by a cardiologist? It wouldn't hurt for you to either go to your regular doctor and tell tehm what is gong on. chances are they might refer you back to your cardilogist to rule things out.Cree Cree (chris is his real name) does get chest pains, however he still has some cardiac issues going on with himI wish you the best of luck and I hope that it isn't anything too seroiusMichelle",

    "question": "I'm 18 years old and I have been having chest pains since I was a child. It is sharp pains and it hurts really bad. I usually can't move around when it happened and It makes it hard for me to breathe. It doesn't happen every day but it is often. It usually comes on when I am angry, stressed, upset, or sometimes I could just be doing nothing. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with it but I was born a month premature, had the RSV virus, have a history of febrile seizures(not since I was like 3) , have a history of heart disease and high blood pressure in my family, history of cancer and diabetes. I don't have the best eating habits now but thats not due to any sort of eating disorder(bulimia or anorexia) I never was able to eat a lot and if I did I would vomit it up. Now I just have a little appetite like I don't really get that hungry which might be the reason the chest pains are happening more often. can you help me?",
