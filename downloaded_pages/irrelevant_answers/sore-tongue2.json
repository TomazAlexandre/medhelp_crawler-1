            "answer": "As Teak so wisely pointed out (Teak is a great poster), you didn't have much of a risk in the first place. In fact, you probably didn't have any risk.In that, you are much like the other posters who wander into this forum. That's not a knock on them, or you. Not at all. It's just that many (and I was like this when I first came here) have an inaccurate view of the ease at which HIV is transmitted. It is not, simply, an easy thing to catch. Sure, people still do get it, but typically not in the way you described. So, try to relax on this, you are going to be just fine.As for people not coming back to post, I actually think that's a good thing. It means that once they have gotten a negative result, they move on with their lives, and have no need for a forum such as this any longer. It indicates a return to sanity!I will tell you the story of my own HIV \"scare\" and \"symtoms\", and perhaps that will reassure you.I came to Medhelp about 7 or 8 months ago. I picked up a woman in a bar, she took me home, and we had a long, long bout of oral sex, mostly me on her. I woke up the next day, blood everywhere. Turns out she was on her period, and I was so drunk I hadn't noticed it. Well, to put it mildly, I freaked! I thought for sure I had HIV, so spent hours everyday reading up on HIV symptoms. That was a huge mistake.I read about a symptom, and the next day, guess what, I had it. Sore throat? Yep. Ulcers in the mouth? You bet. Enlarged lymph nodes? Sure, I thought so. Fever? Again, I thought so. Night sweats? More than once. Weight loss? No lie, I lost 15 pounds in a month. I won't go on, you get the idea.Funny thing was, once I figured out I didn't have HIV, all of those \"symptoms\" just seemed to go away. I can look back on it now and sort of chuckle, but at the time, it was not a good experience. Having said that, I did learn something about the way that extreme stress, fear and anxiety effect the mind, which in turn effects the body. So, it wasn't a total loss.Anyway, as you can see, I have the tendency to be verbose. I wish you luck, but you don't sound like you need much luck at this point. Take care of yourself.",
