            "answer": "I left out the details to be concise. I'm really hoping someone will read this who has special knowledge and write to recommend a doctor with special expertise. Yes, I had lens replacement surgery in 2007 complicated by a radial capsule tear, subsequent PVD and a floater vitrectomy in 2008.\u00a0\u00a0The treatments I've had include continuous steroid drops(Pred Forte or Durazol), NSAID drops (Acular, Xibrom, Nevanac) Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitor drops (Asopt), two intravitreous triamcinolone injections, and 15 anti-VEGF injections (Avastin). The CME sometimes gets a little better, sometimes a little worse, but has not gone away in over two years. It is speculated that the epiretinal membrane may be contributing. I would like to get a second opinion about this.",

    "question": "I have chronic cystoid macular edema of more than two years duration (refractory to treatments) and also a slight epimacular proliferation. My vision is worsening slightly. Local doctors are very conservative and recommend no treatment other than the unsuccesful ones I've tried thus far. Can anyone recommend a doctor for me to see for second opinion. I will travel anywhere. I plan to be in southern California in the spring and would appreciate a recommendation for that area if anyone can help me with this.",
