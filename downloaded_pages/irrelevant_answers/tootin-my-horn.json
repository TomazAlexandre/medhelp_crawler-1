    "question": "2 years ago I weighed 210 lbs, couldn't walk up the hill on our street without huffing and puffing, or walk from my car through the parking lot to to the office without huffing and puffing and having to stop for a few minutes (I later found that was because my brain wasn't talking to my heart on when to beat, thus a pacemaker)...and was wearing size 38 jeansAt any rate, today I'm at 170, wearing size 32 that are just a little snug but I'm in 'em and feeling so much better.slim Jim",
