    "question": "My 77 yr old father (type II diabetic) just had single bypass surgery done 8 days ago (surgery was done \"off pump\"), and is still in the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0He has had to have two blood tranfusions since the surgery as his blood count is low (doctors cant explain the blood loss), and has severe edema in both his legs and his scrotum, which also the doctors cannot explain.\u00a0\u00a0He also had low kidney functions, and shortness of breath due to an injured bronchial tube from a difficult intubation (sp?).\u00a0\u00a0Could the diabetes been a factor in these complications (sans the injured bronchial tube)?",
