            "answer": "Hi,How are you? It is indeed unlikely that the pruritus is associated with the antibiotic if it has been present for a few weeks after you discontinued it. The itchiness could be due to irritation, skin conditions, and even underlying medical issues such as diabetes, anemia, kidney or liver conditions. If it persist, it is best that you have this checked by your doctor and have additional diagnostic tests done to rule out these differentials. Take care and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "A few weeks after I took Macrobid, I developed massive histamine accumulation in my arms and legs, blisters and extreme itching.\u00a0\u00a0It would go away, then other limbs would itch, swell up and blister.\u00a0\u00a0I also had swelling itching and blisters on my back, face, everywhere on my body.\u00a0\u00a0All this was accompanied by swelling in the lining in my lungs that made it very difficult to breathe.\u00a0\u00a0 It kept coming back for months. It just about killed me.",

    "question": "6 weeks ago, I took a course of Macrobid (generic) for a UTI. After completing the 7 day cycle, I developed excruciating heartburn, to the point of tears. The following day (2 days after Macrobid) I started itching (scalp, chest, neck, arms...) This has gone on for 6 weeks! I have been to the doctors, ER, allergist to no avail. ALL of these professionals claim that pruritis (chronic itching of the skin) could NOT be caused from an anitbiotic this long after completing it. I take 300 mg of Zantac and 180 mg f Allegra a day, which does seem to help. Has anyone had an experience where they finished an anitbiotic, and WEEKS later they are releasing histamine? Is it just coincidental that I finished the Macrobid and these symptoms appear?",
