            "answer": "Wish u the best of luck. My 3 hr test comes back tomorrow. I'm a ftm, was 68kg b4 and 165. At 28w I'm 88kgs and well over what the doc says I should be. The type two and gestational run in the family so I am 99% certain I've got it. Don't stress too much about the needles, its just another routine in ur day. Have u actually ever seen the finger prick machine to test urself? Its not fun but also nothing to worry about. How good are you with your diet and exercise? Be prepared to need to do some walking, swimming or anything else ur ob will approve that you like pretty much everyday. Diet will be the hardest thing if you've never been very strict with your foods. Check every thing in ur pantry fridge and when u go shopping for added sugar, glucose, anything that ends in syrup or says fruit juice. Also anything that ends in -ose. These are alll hidden sugars. Dont fret. U are allowed a little, but better to use that up on the stuff u are craving rather than ur breakfast cereal!!! The insulin is usually self injected. Ur ob and or midwife will show you how to do it. I think thigh ir tummy is still the preferred injection spots. Good luck again.",

    "question": "So my first glucose test was 170 (or 175, cant remember which he said). Saturday I go for my 3 hr glucose test to determine if i have gestational diabetes. My sister, a nurse, told me to relax and not get ahead of myself. Already being overweight and having a sweet tooth all my life, all i feel is guilt and disappointment. My obgyn told me numerous times that my baby girl looks perfect but its important to catch gestational diabetes early. Ill be 20 weeks Saturday. I'm not being negative thinking my blood sugqr will be high. I think I'm just being a realist.So my question: what was your experience with gestational diabetes? No information you share is too basic. I know almost nothing about it.",
