            "answer": "Hi,It could possibly be due to the presence of a stone in the urinary bladder or urethra which can cause such a radiating pain to the tip of the urethra and thus will suggest you to consult a urologist and seek an opinion as you might need further tests like an ultrasound or a CT-IVU for the confirmation of the diagnosis. The other possibility is balanitis which is the inflammation of the glans penis. You might need further tests like blood glucose to rule out diabetes or a wet mount to rule out fungal infection. Please do consult a urologist as it\u2019s very difficult to make a diagnosis without physical examination. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
