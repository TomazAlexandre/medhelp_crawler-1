            "answer": "I live in America too and I think the real delusion is that America was #1. We have been the laughing stock of the world for quite a long time now and didn't realize it. Why? Because we all walk around going \"we're number 1, we're number 1!\" But we close our eyes to what is going on in the rest of the planet.You're not bipolar because of the changing in the country. You're bipolar because you have a physical illness which causes your brain to produce the wrong chemicals. It's a physical illness. Something in your body doesn't work right, so your brain malfunctions and you have bipolar. Just like someone who has diabetes. They don't get diabetes from eating sugar. That's a myth. Type 1: auto-immune system attacks the pancreas which stops producing insulin (a chemical). Bipolar: something in the brain isn't functioning giving us the chemicals we need to function properly. See?It's hard to be diagnosed with something. It's hard to live with something that no one understands and most people just roll their eyes at you if they find out. But I do agree with you in the sense that society drags us down and makes us feel worthless on top of our illness, which is harder for us to combat since we do have our illness. You have to figure out what is important to you and live for that, don't worry about the government and the rock stars. They are just people who are just as smart/stupid as everyone else. They are not special. We make them special but they're really not.",
