            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Romberg\u2019s test comes positive in people who are intoxicated with alcohol, have vitamin B 12 deficiency, have peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme\u2019s lupus, have neurosyphilis or Friedreich's Ataxia.Failure to perform the tandem gait (walking in a straight line with the toes of the foot at the back touching the heel of the foot in front) is usually indicative of truncal ataxia. This is seen in cerebellar diseases.Hyper-responsive reflexes or hyperreflexia is usually due to injury or compression of the spinal cord and is seen below the level of injury or compression. It can also be the side effect of certain medications and can occur in conditions like electrolyte imbalance, hyperthyroidism, brain trauma and serotonin syndrome.Since you have tremors since childhood, you could also be suffering from inherited ataxia. Genetic studies may be required. All these factors such be considered and investigated for. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
