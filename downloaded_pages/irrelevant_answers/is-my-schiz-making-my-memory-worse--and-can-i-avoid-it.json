    "question": "I have had Schizophrenia for at least 4 years now. I know when I first noticed it, though I cannot remember when it started. In short, I have visual and auditory hallucinations constantly, and so far I only have 3 voices, two female and one male. I have had memory loss for as long as I can remember, which would be since 5th grade. I am 17 now.My memory loss has gotten significantly worse. I went from being able to remember an assignment was due on a certain day to not being able to remember a number less than 5 minutes later, or being unable to remember a statement a minute later. I hve no idea how to avoid this and I was wondering if anyone could give me tips because I am hoping to catch my memory loss before it is too late, and my career depends on my memory.I am not on any meds yet, if that helps.",
