            "answer": "I would ask the doctor to run the test for celiac. Many diabetic children do have celiac, and rather than just assuming that he is too young, if I were his mom, I would ask to have him tested. Also, you may want to look at food allergies. Allergies can cause a child's adrenalin/cortisol levels to rise (that's what the body does to fight off allergies), and the result of high levels of adrenalin (which is insulin-resistant) is high glucose levels. Your son may be allergic to dairy products or to wheat, which is a totally different problem from celiac, which is the inability to break down gluten. You may want to try removing some of the commonly allergic foods from his diet, one food at a time, to see if it helps.",
