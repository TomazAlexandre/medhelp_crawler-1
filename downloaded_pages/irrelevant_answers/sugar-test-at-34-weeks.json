    "question": "Is it still ok to have the sugar test done at 34 weeks? I had an appointment to get it done earlier but was not able to keep it. I called for another appointment the other day and it is set for friday but I didnt even think about the fact that I might be too far along. Is it safe? I am sure once I get to the doctor they will ask me how far along I am and tell me rather or not it is, but I thought maybe I could save time and find out sooner.ThanksJennifer",
