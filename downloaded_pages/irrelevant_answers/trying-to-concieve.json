            "answer": "Are you charting your cycles or checking your cervical mucus to see when you ovulate? Usually after you have been trying for a year with no luck, you can make an appointment with you gyn. and he can do some tests to see what the problem is. since your periods are irregular, you could probably make an appt. now. He will probably want your husband to make an appt. w/ an urologist to get him checked also. A lot of women here track their cycles at www.fertilityfriend.com. You should check out that website. The best thing that you can do for yourself right now is to get to know your body, how you feel when you ovulate, if there is a pattern with your periods.As for positions, mission is the best fpr conceiving, and oral sex is out because saliva kills sperm.",
