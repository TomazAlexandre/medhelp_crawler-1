            "answer": "Do not be afraid how you will appear to a doctor. The more info they have to go on the better. Your symptoms do sound like adrenal problems, and consulting with another endocrinologist may get you more answers. September is a long time to wait and feel miserable.Do keep in mind that sleep apnea can cause weight gain and stress the adrenals with the repeated output of adrenaline and throws many of the body's systems out of whack. It can also contribute to diabetes. If you have any other symptoms pointing that way, wouldn't hurt to check it out. Could be you've got more than one thing going on.",

    "question": "I am a 29 year old female who has over the last year gained an unexpected, unexplained 35 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0I have always been thin and now feeling very uncomfortable.About a year and half ago I went for a yearly pap smear and told my gyno that I had been experiencing a lot of ovulation pain, apparent cysts as well as an odd thing of still secreating milk even though I stopped breast feeding 4.5 years prior.\u00a0\u00a0They ordered a few tests ACTH, TCH and a few others I can't remember.\u00a0\u00a0They also started me on oral contraceptive.\u00a0\u00a0With in days of beginning the pill my milk production stopped and I never had the blood tests done.\u00a0\u00a0(Stupid, yes, I know)A year later I went back for the annual and told them about the weight gain and they ordered a few more tests.\u00a0\u00a0The only one that came back abnormal was my fasting insulin level was very high.\u00a0\u00a0I was referred to an endocrinolgoist.He ran a series of tests, including renal panal, Coritsol and 2 hour oral glucose.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with Diabetes a month ago.\u00a0\u00a0The corisol test required me to take a pill at 11 pm and then the blood work to be done precisely at 8 am the next day.\u00a0\u00a0If HIGH, it would indicate the precence of an adreal or pituitary gland tumor.\u00a0\u00a0The normal range was 4-22.\u00a0\u00a0Mine came back very low at 1.9.The last two times I have been in high sudden stress situations (a friend confronting me with something very rudely & being involved with police catching someone that stole from me and me seeing them arrest him) the normal stress indicators appear like red face, racing heart, jittery, etc.\u00a0\u00a0But, then I get UNBELIEVABLY bad pain in both of my kidneys.\u00a0\u00a0It is severe for a minute or so, then decreases to an ache for several days.Can anyone help me... and can anyone recommend how I should approach my Dr. with this without looking like a crazy person?\u00a0\u00a0I don't have another appointment with the endocrinologist until September.",
