            "answer": "First, they are no doctors on this forum although we do get pseudo medical students dropping in from time to time. We are patients who volunteer our time to assist other patients.\"Although she take it after meal\"Normally this means as soon as she is finished eating, not waiting a few hours then taking them. Right? When a patient experiences stomach disturbance the next step is to take medication/s with meals. If it continues, discontinue use and notify the doctor.There are six classifications of oral diabetes medications sold in the USA with several drugs listed under each. Amaryl and Diamicron MR are listed as Sulfonylureas yet appear to affect your grandmother differently. Everybody is different; one drug may cause discomfort in one patient yet it does not in another. Unless she is willing to experiment try to get her to understand which is easier for her at her age; injecting insulin or experimenting with drugs that may cause her an upset stomach or other worsening side effects.",
