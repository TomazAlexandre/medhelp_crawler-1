    "question": "Thank you for your previous response.\u00a0\u00a0You suggest that I have my doctor eliminate the possibility of pheochromocytoma (very rare).\u00a0\u00a0I have been reading about this and understand that blood pressure is often elevated.\u00a0\u00a0When I first started having my symptoms my bp ran 124/77 and have recently had readings of 136/92 and 150/80.\u00a0\u00a0Changes often. This is the range even taking beta-blockers.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't mention in previous post, but I did have a ct scan to see if maybe my stomach was causing my pain.\u00a0\u00a0Was told test was normal.\u00a0\u00a0This was done before realizing that my heart rate was so high during exercise up to 200bpm before the pain would develop.\u00a0\u00a0Also had blood tests. I have all results (\"normal\").\u00a0\u00a0Would there be anything on the blood test to indicate the possibility of pheochromocytoma?\u00a0\u00a0Also, the ct states \"small less than one cm low attenuation lesion noted within the inferior pole of the left kidney, too small for accurate characterization\". Could this suggest pheochromocytoma or would the tumor only exist on the adrenal glands?\u00a0\u00a0Not sure they would have even been looking for this.\u00a0\u00a0Should I have this checked again? Or should have a 24hr urine test?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you again.",
