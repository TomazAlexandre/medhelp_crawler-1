            "answer": "Ceev, first let me help with your primary concern, that you may have MS. Even with your family history, it is no where near likely. Even among identical twins, with the exact same genes and nearly the exact same environment, the likelihood that one will get MS if the other one has it is low, not the 100% you'd expect. The number of affected people in the family doesn't really matter. The fact that your sister developed it in her 20s and you are in your 40s even decreases your risk. What I'm saying is that risk is very complicated, but it's not likely MS is the cause of your symptoms, especially since it's bilateral and in hands and feet.So I would consider reviewing the causes of peripheral neuropathy. (Most experts consider MS a disease of the central nervous system\u2013the brain, spinal cord and cranial nerves\u2013 exclusively, ruling it out as a source of damage to the peripheral nerves\u2013all the rest of them, like the arms and legs. If I read your question correctly, your hands and feet only feel swollen, but aren't. You can do a search for the causes of peripheral neuropathy and see if anything jumps out at you; diabetic neuropathy may be most likely, since it sounds as if you could be eating much better that you have been. NOTE: Be sure to read several lists, from the best sources you can find. Many internet lists are not from great sources and often have some agenda or another.Whether you find anything that way or not, go to see your healthcare practitioner, sooner rather than later. Peripheral neuropathy is is not a disease or a diagnosis, it is only a symptom of a disease or condition. That disease could be serious, treatable, and one that is progressive and be doing irreversible damage each day it is not treated, which cannot happen until it is correctly diagnosed. That may unfortunately take some time. But it should take some investigation and time. Interestingly, I have MS, and am having the symptoms like yours in my feet. I've had two, yes, 2, internists whom I think of highly, misdiagnose me with offhanded comments. According to one, I have diabetic neuropathy. Oops! Excuse me! Good choice, except that I don't have diabetes! The other laid it to MS, which I've already discussed with you here. Sigh.Let us both resolve to act this weekend.You review the possible causes of your neuropathy, using that research to help you make a list to gather any pertinent information you will need to take with you to the appointment, the one you are going to call and schedule Monday. You should not rule MS out entirely; you could be experiencing MS-induced paresthesias, like your sister. I am praying that you do not have MS!As for me, I will consider which doctor I will pursue, after I gather and print a suitable number of medical research articles proving the point that, while MS does cause paresthesias in the feet, it doesn't cause what I'm experiencing, and the lab work (A1C) that I do not have diabetes.I am praying for you, Ceev!I will also follow up on something else I've begun to research.There is symptomatic relief for these symptoms, but I'm sure of only one right now. You should NOT pursue this yet, until you have a solid diagnosis, which advice I am following, too. It is a specialized laser called Calmare. When and if you need it, after an accurate diagnosis, find a doc certified to use it.",

            "answer": "Hi and welcome,I don't believe you should be concerned about MS or even peripheral neuropathy, at this stage it realistically could be many different things, it would be in your best interest to discuss this with your GP but i would highly recommend keeping open minded as to it's causation!Cheers........JJ",
