            "answer": "Some people seem to be more prone to complications than others, and there is no way to know which type a person is until some years have passed. But studies have proven that if a person keeps glucose levels as normal as possible, the risk of developing complications is much lower. So his risk largely depends on how well he keeps his glucose levels in the normal range. I personally have had the disease for 38 years with no complications. I hope to live another 50 years with the same good health.",
