            "answer": "I have not had a MRI or CT. When I asked my GP if what I was experiencing was because of the blow to the head, he told me he highly doubted it. It could be a slow intracranial bleed (sub acute subdural) but I got hit two months ago. A more probable cause could be Encephalitis, but I am not a doctor. I am going to see my GP tomorrow to tell him the pins and needles have gotten worse and to try and pressure the neurologist into seeing me earlier.",

            "answer": "So it seems that for public health care it takes 11 weeks to see a neurologist. I am going to see one privately tomorrow evening. Details to come about what he may think it is.",

            "answer": "So I talked to my neurologist on Monday. All my nervous systems tests came back fine. He thinks it is Post Traumatic Syndrome caused by the hit to the head. I had an MRI of my cervical spine and brain yesterday and get the results tomorrow. He thinks they will come back normal. I noticed a lump on the right side of my neck today. My guess is that the MRI is going to show I have a lump on my thyroid, and my symptoms have actually been thyroid related caused by this lump. Details to come tomorrow.",

    "question": "About 2 months ago I accidently got kicked in the side of the head after a night at the bar. My right ear and side of my head was swollen for about a week. Shortly after this I started getting a little dizzy off/on for a couple weeks. I figured it was a head cold. During this time I had a sore throat. A couple weeks ago my left arm went numb for a couple hours and I went to the emergency room. They told me it was a pinched nerve in my shoulder. A couple days after that I started getting pins and needles in my hands and feet. About a day after I got floaters in my right eye, and ringing in my right ear. The feeling has gone from my hands and feet to everywhere in my body off and on. I have experienced dizzyness, headaches, and a slight case of vertigo the last few weeks. I am a 24 year old male with no family history of MS. My blood tests have come back normal from my GP, no diabetes, and I have an appointment with a neurologist very soon. I was wondering what people here might think it is. It is sort of playing games with my mind because my older brother recently had a case of Bells Palsy. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.",
