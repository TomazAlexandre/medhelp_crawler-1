            "answer": "Drugs and insulin do not mix you can get abnormal blood glucose readings. I know after type 1 for 30 years. Seizures are actually a good response to low blood sugar in sleep state they can save your life. Another thing don't ever trust the emt blood sugar testing equipment it is the worst I've ever seen in most cases. Watch her close and check her blood glucose mid sleep around 1:30 2:00 this is when most problems occur. Just to get a grip on what is goin on. Then adjust insulin and back to normal. Prevention is the answer. I hope this helps.",

    "question": "My 10-year-old daughter was diagnosed with diabetes 1 last summer.\u00a0\u00a0Last week, we got her a flu shot because we were told that diabetics should have flu shots.\u00a0\u00a0The day after she got the shot, she had a seizure.\u00a0\u00a0We took her to the ER.\u00a0\u00a0She had numerous blood tests done and a CAT scan which all turned out to be completely normal.\u00a0\u00a0Her blood sugar, when the paramedics arrived, was 81.\u00a0\u00a0The ER doctor told us he thought the seizure was due to a drop in blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0She sees an endocrinologist for her diabetes, and that doctor said we should take her to a pediatrician to have her checked.\u00a0\u00a0The pediatrician said it could have been caused by the flu shot, but she did not think it was the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0She did some neurological tests on her that turned out to be normal.\u00a0\u00a0Another doctor we consulted said it was probably caused by the flu shot, but another doctor said it could be a seizure disorder when she has had only one.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas?\u00a0\u00a0It's confusing when we are getting so many conflicting opinions.",
