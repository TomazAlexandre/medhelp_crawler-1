A doctor might begin to warn you, but not necessarily treat or give the diagnosis of diabetes under those circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0 Whereas, if a younger, active, healthy person were to show those blood sugars, it would be cause for investigation and the possible diagnosis of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0As with most questions like yours, it is best to consult with your physician to be sure. If it is diabetes, the sooner you treat and control those blood sugars, the better your chances are for avoiding complications from diabetes.Es",

            "answer": "Thanks. I have Gestational Diabetes right now, and occasionally I will see it drift up in the 140's, but that is typically about an hour after eating (usually more carbs than I should). So I was wondering what is actually a normal peak level. Thanks again...I test 4 times a day, and when I test my levels are always within normal ranges....Thanks again",

            "answer": "There are some books out by doctors that give pretty precise information about blood sugar before and after eating and that suggest that even in normal people, it will go up after a meal high in carbs.\u00a0\u00a0\"Normal is around 70's to 80's but can go up to 140.\u00a0\u00a0They set 140 as an arbitrary line for the diagnosis of diabetes - anyone with higher than 140 BG is considered diabetic by most regular physicians - at least that is what various doctors told me.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps.",
