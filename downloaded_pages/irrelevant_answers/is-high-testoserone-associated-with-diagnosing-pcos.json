            "answer": "They did blood work and an u/sMy u/s came back fine.The blood work showed elevated Testosterone and high levels of insulin and high blood sugar levels.Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a complicated disorder with many possible symptoms. The increase in androgens contributes to many of the symptoms that women experience. Because androgens are hormones which cause the typical male characteristics, many of the symptoms cause a distressing change in appearance. Depression is common as a result.Hirsutism: Increased hair growth in strange places (chest, face, back, lower abdomen, fingers, toes).Hair loss: Hair loss similar to male pattern baldness.Infertility: Difficulty in conceiving or becoming pregnant. Usually a result of irregular periods, or not ovulating each month.Infrequent or absent periodsAnovulation or oligovulation: Not ovulating, or releasing a mature egg from the ovary each month. Without ovulation, periods may be irregular or absent.Ovarian cystsObesityAcneAcanthosis nigricans: Patches of dark, thickened, velvety skin behind the neck, on the thighs, or on the vulva. This is usually a sign of insulin resistance.Insulin resistance: The body does not respond as well to insulin, the primary hormone which helps the body use and deal with glucose or sugar. This causes elevated blood glucose levels and is a major risk factor for Type 2 Diabetes.Type 2 diabetes: Prolonged exposure to high levels of glucose and the reduced sensitivity of body cells to insulin eventually make the body unable to deal with sugar. When glucose levels are persistently high, complications develop. These include problems with eye sight, kidney disease, and neuropathy, which is a loss of feeling and circulation in the body limbs.High cholesterolSkin tags: Excess flaps of skin, usually found in the armpit or groin.High blood pressureSleep apnea or snoring",

            "answer": "Your information is so very helpful! I have had Graves Disease for almost a year now and my Endo just kind of blew off my problems arrising with my Testosterone levels as being related to eachother. I found out later that it was not and I am getting into the doctors next week! About a year ago I had some ovarian cysts that ruptured and it was very painful. I sometimes have the same stomach and worry again that's what it is. For the past few years I have been dealing with worsened acne and hair growth issues. I seem to have more hair on my cheeks, stomach, back, and even on my arms and legs it grows faster and thicker. It really has been bothering me and plucking would take me all day long and shaving is not an option for anything besides my legs. I hope I get it all taken care of soon! Thanks so much!",

    "question": "On 8/13/08 I had to get my Testosterone levels checked to start an acne medication and my Free Testosterone was elevated at 2.13 (normal range 0.10-1.50), but my Testosterone was fine at 54 (normal range 14-76). Due to some concern over these results my physician decided to recheck them on 9/25/08 and again my Free Testosterone was high at 3.14 and my Testosterone was also elevated at 79. During my research about high Testosterone in woman PCOS is something that came up more often than anything else. If you could please help me with any information available I would really appreciate it. Thank you very much!",
