            "answer": "Dizziness after eating is, most of the times, a symptom of some kind of disorder occurring in the digestive or nervous system/s. This too can happen with diabetics when they consume sugary or high carbohydrated foods. However, I ruled out diabetes when you stated \"I ate about 4 nuts and instantly got this dizzy sensation.\"It's good to see that you have an appointment with a doctor for a complete physical exam. If your PCP cannot get to the bottom of your dizziness ask for a referral to a Gastroenterologist and a Neurologist. Good luck.",

            "answer": "My mom and dad both have diabetes. Do you have type 1 or 2? This seems quite an odd reaction to me. Have you taken your blood sugar at these times? Although it is an odd symptom I could believe just about anything from diabetes. My mother once vomited every day all day long for a year, they changed her for metformin to glucaphage and it stopped. Coincidence or Not? Supposedly the same drug. It is good your going to the Dr. I hope you are seeing a specialist.K",

            "answer": "Hi, thanks for the replies. Kdaffyc, I do not have diabetes (and hopefully will never) and I thought these symptoms were hinting that I have diabetes. However, I do not have those other symptoms, such as hunger/thirst/urine a lot.These dizzy feelings can last for hours after I eat. I've done myself a blood pressure check and it seems fine (110/65 average).And yeah I hope I can fix this problem soon, I have exams in a few weeks and I can't study well with this problem.",

    "question": "I'm not sure if this concerns with diabetes, but it's somewhere to start because I have no idea what is wrong with me.I am unable to see a doctor until next week and I'd like opinions on what might be the problem.Anything I eat, I mean anything (fruits, rice, bread, candy, nuts, anything) it causes me to do into a slightly air-headed dizzy state. Sorta like when you're slightly drunk. I can still concentrate but not as well as I should. Now this happens seconds after I eat anything, and no matter how small I eat. For example the other day I ate about 4 nuts and instantly got this dizzy sensation.It's been going on for about a week now and I'm really worried about this. I am a 20 year old male, who is active in sport, eat normally and is in the right weight.",
