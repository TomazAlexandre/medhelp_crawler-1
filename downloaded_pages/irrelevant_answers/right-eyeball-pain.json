            "answer": "I have been having pain from the inside on my right eye since friday last week, when it hurts i could the pain runs from the righr eyeball to the eyebrow and on the left eyebrow. it seems like migraine but its been doing the same thing every single day especially nightime. After taking mefenamic acid it would eventually relieve the apin until the next night. I normally go to bed around 4am like recently and last night i tried not to go online and just go to bed early, thinking it could also because i lack sleep, but today as I woke up the pain is still there and now hurts like hell.Do i need a CT-scan or just go to my Eye doctor?Thanksdrix19",
