            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The symptoms could be due to menopause/hormonal imbalance of PCOD, anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems. Another possibility is sleep disturbances (like sleep apnea, imbalance of rapid eye and non rapid eye movement sleep etc.). You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, low Vit B12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium. Hyperthyroidism too causes increased sweating and tiredness.\u00a0\u00a0 Postviral fatigue syndrome is another possibility. Persisting EBV infection or mono can also be the cause. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

    "question": "For a week and a half I've been kind of \"out-there\" if you will. I haven't been able to think properly, and I've been struggling with staying awake and going to sleep. My body feels numb half of the time and my eyes have been feeling really weird. I'm 16 years old and this is the first time I've ever experienced anything like this and to be honest, it's scaring me a little. What could this be? And should I be worried about these symptoms?",
