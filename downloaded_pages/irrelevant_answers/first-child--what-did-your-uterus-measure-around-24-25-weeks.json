            "answer": "I think torso length makes a difference, at my 26 week appt I was measuring fine, but my little girls was sitting up higher too. She seems to have moved down a bit in the last week or so, they measured yesterday and now think I'm measuring small (4th pregnancy, measured small with all of them) so now need an ultrasound monday to check her weight. My first two they swore were going to be under 6lbs but one was 6lbs 10oz and the second was 7lbs 10oz, my third was delivered early to keep him small due to a fibroid partially blocking my cervix (and they were afraid they would cut it if they did a c) so he was 5 lbs 6oz, but we're sure if he had stayed in the extra 3 weeks he would also have been over 6lbs. It's crazy but I think a lot has to do with how your body is built and how you carry.",

    "question": "I'm fairly petite person, if that has anything to do with what I measure, but I don't think.. I won't get glucose test till almost 29 weeks but at my appointment this week they were surprised at how high I measured or it grew in last month. Plus at ultrasound a month ago they thought baby was a little big too. She said depending on appointment next month they would maybe do another ultrasound. Definitely hope I don't have gestational diabetes :/ I wasn't extremely high just in the top high end she said. But I don't know what's the average measures at this amount of weeks. Any idea? Thanks! And my due date is definitely accurate.",
