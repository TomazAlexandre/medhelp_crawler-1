            "answer": "Thanks! :)\u00a0\u00a0All of this is very new to me and it's confusing trying to figure out all of the numbers and the diffrent types of diabetes etc.My Dr. told me he wants to see me in a month, but I didn't tell him about all of the other symptoms that I have been having. I didn't think they were related at the time. Would it be safe for me to wait the month before I go back or should I try and get in sooner? Also, should I be testing my blood sugar at home? My dad is hypoglicemic (sp?) and he bought a testing thing at the drug store and he checks his levels often. Is this something that I should look into buying or just wait till I see the Dr.?\u00a0\u00a0About an hour ago I had another \"attack\" like I did at the Dr. office. That kind of thing has been happening several times a day now. I have been drinking a lot of orange juice and that seems to take away the symptoms pretty quickly.If I should buy a testing thing, is there a certain one that I would need in my case?thanks for the reply! All of this is pretty scary. My mom's brother-in-law died of diabetes. So I want to make sure I am safe.Tomorrow I will try eating several small meals and see if that helps.Also, another symptom I have been having is that I'm hungry ALL the time. I can't seem to get full after eating. And if I do, I'm hungry again in 30 min or less. Is that common with my situation?",

            "answer": "You can wait a month to see your dr. if your symptons get worst call him sooner.......Make you feel comfortable get a home test you might feel better........ Ask a pharmcay what glucose test is the best one...........Yes when that is one of the symptons is hungry all the time.........I know it is scary but long if you take care of yourself you are going to be fine.People with diabties they have a long happy life........Write to me later and let me know how you feel.......It sounds like to me you might have hyperglymcia since it runs in your family.Get the test done and this test will tell you if you have diabeties or hyperglymcia...... Ya let me know later how you feel....You are going to be fine.",

            "answer": "Hi, I was just reading your post.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have diabetes but have hypoglycemia, low blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I experience some of your symptoms, though.\u00a0\u00a0Like bip said, watching what you eat is key.\u00a0\u00a0If you google 'glycemic index' you will find a list of foods and their sugar (glycemic) content rating.\u00a0\u00a0I try to always choose low glycemic foods.\u00a0\u00a0BTW, potatoes are high on the glycemic index but sweet potatoes are very low.\u00a0\u00a0Go figure.The great thing about type 2 diabetes is that you can make a huge impact on it by the choices you make for food and drink.\u00a0\u00a0You can also get a blood sugar tester at the drug store.\u00a0\u00a0That helps, but I usually know when I'm low.Just a thought...have your hormones been tested?\u00a0\u00a0The sweating issue made me think of that.Good luck!Lori",

    "question": "I posted the last part of this on the diabetes forum, but it doesn't look like it's very active so I hoped I would get some answers over here. (though this one is slowing down also)I will also list some symptoms that I have been having. I don't know if they are related to any of this or not.Been sweating a lot even if I'm not in a warm room. I will be sitting watching t.v or something and I will start to feel really warm and start sweating. And doing simple things that I have always done, like filling the dishwasher, I will have sweat running down my face.On and off my mouth has been extra dry. I'm not really thirsty, it's just dry. Sometimes drinking water does't fix the problem right away.My face and chest has been breaking out really bad. I have never in my life had more than 2 pimples at the same time. Not even as a teen. I have always had really good skin.\u00a0\u00a0Now they are all over. I wash my face every morning and sometimes at night if I remember. I'm not doing anything different than normal. But the breaking out could also be due to me sweating more or possibly getting older? (29 yrs).And through out the day I will get really shaky. It gets so bad that sometimes my teeth chatter like when you are cold, but I'm not cold.I'm not quite sure how to explain this, but sometimes I feel the shakiness inside of my body, it's not always on the outside where my hands will skake. (I hope that made sence) There isn't a pattern with the shakiness. I have it sometimes after I eat, sometimes when my stomach is empty, it's just random. And my urine is practicaly clear. I'm not drinking any more fluids than I usually do.\u00a0\u00a0And I have been extra tired, very low energy.Last week I had my blood drawn and my blood sugar was a little high (as I stated below) and my white blood count was on the high side, but they were not worried about that. (I just had my gallbladder taken out, so that might be why?)All my other blood work came out normal.Ok, below is the post I posted on the diabetes forum....Ok, I'm really confused about all of this. I went to the Dr. the other day and had this episode of dizziness, sweating and feeling sick to my stomach. It hit me out of the blue. Luckily my Dr. was right there and checked my blood sugar. I had eaten very little that day.\u00a0\u00a0It was at 65. He gave me some oj and then checked it again and it was at 74.\u00a0\u00a0He looked in my file and noticed that a week earlier I had my blood sugar checked twice. On a full stomach it was at 100, then fasting for 9 hours it was 125. What does this mean? He wants me to come back in in a month and drink this stuff and then test me again. He told me that now there is a really good chance of developing diabetes within the next 10 years. I don't really understand anything about diabetes. I thought that with diabetes you have either high or low blood sugar, not both. Can somebody please help me understand this?",
