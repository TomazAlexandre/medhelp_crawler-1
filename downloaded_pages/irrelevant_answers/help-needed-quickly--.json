            "answer": "Hello David,\u00a0\u00a0I was afraid it would be something like that. We have no good treatment for central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Even if it happened in the ophthalmologists office we are not able to give it \"first aid\".You eye will need to be watched carefully as there are a number of delayed complications that might develop in that eye including vitreous hemorrhage and especially a severe type of gluucoma called neovascular glaucoma. Sometimes a laser treatment is needed to prevent this from happening.Although recovery of vision is usally poor it can sometimes improve for several months although rarely does it recover fully.The condition could affect your other eye. There are many causes of CRVO and an adequate work-up will involve you seeing an internal disease specialist or a very good family doctor to rule out problems in your eye that can cause this. Any underlying problem must be vigorously treated. Patients with CRVO have shorter life expectancies that those not having due to the high prevalance of under lying disease.This is not an all inclusive list of possible causes of CRVO but it includes the most common: smoking and use of nicotine products, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, \"thick blood\" (blood dyscrasias), heart and lung disease, abnormalities of blood clotting, and inflammation of the blood vessels.In the eye undiagnosed for treated glaucoma can cause CRVO.While you are waiting to see the ophthalmologist line up an appointment with an internist or good family doctor.Go on line and use Google to search CRVO and print out the list of possible causes and take it into the Internist or GP.Also ask about low dose aspirin therapy as a preventatiave.JCH III MD\u00a0\u00a0Ophthalmologist",

    "question": "Within the last week or two I have suddenly developed a large dark spot within my vision ( not visibleexternally )stretching from the inner corner of my left eye to the center, it\u00a0\u00a0obscures my sight to quite a degree.
