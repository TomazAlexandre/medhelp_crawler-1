            "answer": "You're right!During the night, he goes many hours without eating. If he has dinner, let's say at 6pm and breakfast the next day at 8am....that's 14 hours without eating. So during the night, his blood sugar goes down and the liver notices and gives him a bunch of the sugar it had saved. ....and that causes the blood sugar in the morning to be high.So if the liver gives him sugar at night because he hasn't eaten in many hours, what does he have to do to stop the liver from giving him all that sugar?EAT!!!!It's as simple as that.By eating a snack that contains PROTEIN half an hour before going to bed, it will keep his blood sugar from going way down, so the liver won't have to give him a bunch of sugar during the night.So if bedtime is 10pm, the snack needs to be at 9:30pm. The snack MUST CONTAIN PROTEIN so that it will last all night long.\u00a0\u00a0Oatmeal is the same as Cereal....it's carbohydrate and will last only about 2-3 hours....and after the 3 hours, the liver would start giving him sugar. Protein lasts alot longer.Examples of bedtime snacks:Half meat (turkey, tuna, etc) or peanut butter sandwich (no jelly).Cheese (low fat, white has less cholesterol) and crackers.Tuna and crackers.Small quesadilla.Half grilled cheese sandwich.(He can also have a small glass of Non-Fat, 1% or 2% milk)Remember, it's supposed to be a snack, not a meal.",

    "question": "What can be done to help with over night spiking?\u00a0\u00a0It seems if he does not eat anything for long period, such as over night, his blood sugar spikes. I am thinking his liver is trying to help out where it is\u00a0\u00a0not actually, by puttinng glucose in system? I am guessing here. Any input welcome.\u00a0\u00a0I am now trying a small bowl of oatmeal before bedtime to see if that helps. TO early to tell yet.",
