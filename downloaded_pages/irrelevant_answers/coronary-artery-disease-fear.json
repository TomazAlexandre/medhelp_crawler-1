            "answer": "Hi, there are thousands of diseases or conditions and only a few unlucky or high risk population tend to get them. So, stop worrying. Blood vessels are narrowed most commonly due to atherosclerosis, a disease where the 'fatty' material in the blood gets deposited in the walls of the blood vessels. Certain conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking and sedentary life style promote this. Other causes for narrowing are stenosis and vasculitis. When a blood clot tries to pass through a narrowed lumen it causes an obstruction to flow. Sometimes the damaged vessel may develop a clot at the site of injury. Controlling diabetes and hypertension and following good lifestyle measures can help control calcification. Regular exercise and avoiding fatty foods can help to increase the flow through the narrowed arteries. So, work towards a healthy life style & good health. Regards.",

How is it possible the plaque which was 50% blocked can be automatically be blocked by 100%. I got very feared after reading this article. I think it can be due to rapture of plaque which can cause blockage. How can the plaque automatically becomes thick (double) all of sudden to increase it by 100%. Can somebody plz help remove my doubt. I will be grateful to you. If it is applicable to high risk patient like diabetic.

How within hour your plaque will be double from 50% to 100%. This has confused & created fear in my mind. Any normal person who has 50% blocked in his arteries, how it can become 100% without any risk factor. If someone is smoking or not exercising or eating unhealthy deep fried food, he can developed cad & that also after a long time. Can someone plz help me.",
