            "answer": "None of us here is a physician, so be sure to check things out with your diabetes doctor.What you describe sounds like it could be diabetic neuropathy -- a complication of diabetes of all forms.\u00a0\u00a0Neurpathy can begin with tingling and some numbness.\u00a0\u00a0It is potentially very serious because if we cannot feel the bottoms of our feet and if (when?) we step on something sharp or cut ourselves, we won't know.\u00a0\u00a0Infections can set in and since we might also have compromised blood circulation to our feet, the infection can become very serious very quickly.In the short run, do all that you can to achieve excellent blood sugar control and talk with your endo about tests and treatments for neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to visually check your feet daily and to avoid going barefoot -- even indoors.\u00a0\u00a0There are some pharmaceutical medications that can alleviate pain associated with neurpathy.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not certain about natural treatments.There is good information on the JDRF website.\u00a0\u00a0Most of the info pertains to all of us (type 1 or 2), so I encourage you to check out their research reports.\u00a0\u00a0Visit JDRF at www.jdrf.org and click on the link to RESEARCH (top left just under the logo).\u00a0\u00a0On the research page, you can search using the word neuropathy and there are a few good, recent articles.Tingling & numbness can also be caused by pinched nerves and/or carpal tunnel syndrome (in hands) or tarsal tunnel syndrome (in feet).\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and take good care of you & your feet.",

            "answer": "I am not a doctor, but am a long-time diabetic who works closely with the support team for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. The pins and needles sensation may be an early symptom of nerve damage. The natural way to help yourself is to acheive great glucose control, ideally keeping glucose between 70-126 before all meals and no higher than 180 after eating. If the nerve damage is just beginning, (and this could be the case since you are a newly diagnosed diabetic, for your glucose has probably been high for a longer period of time than you knew) then lowering the gluocse numbers will remove the CAUSE of damage and let your body heal itself. Neuropathy can get better if caught early and if damage is minimal, so lowering those glucose levels before serious damage has been done is the key.Many diabetics who suffer from neuropathy claim that the pain or other uncomfortable sensations do improve when gluocse levels are tightly controlled. There is no other treatment that will actually heal the body, and if sensations get severe, then patients must go to their doctors for medications that mask the pain.You need to not only get the glucose levels in good control, but also give your body enough time to improve after acheiving good glucose levels. Test often to see what is happening with your glucose levels and watch your diet carefully. It sounds as if your diet and exercise and weight are all in your favor.",
