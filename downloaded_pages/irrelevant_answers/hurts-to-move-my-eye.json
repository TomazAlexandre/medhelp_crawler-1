            "answer": "Generally such a problem is due to inflammation, or a palsy of the abducens, or sixth cranial nerve, a somatic efferent nerve. It could be from infection, meningitis, diabetic neuropathy, or a host of other causes.What you need to do is pack up your kit bag, saddle your horse, and head for an opthamologist for an in-person evaluation.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The first thing that you need to do is consult an ophthalmologist. The problem could be a foreign body or glaucoma or\u00a0\u00a0any inflammation. It can also be an inflammation of nerve. Since you have a headache too, possibility of pinched cervical nerve, trigeminal neuralgia, temporal arteritis, benign intracranial hypertension, hypothyroidism or diabetes causing neuropathy etc too should be looked at.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor and get a referral for an ophthalmologist and a neurologist. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Sooo I experience discomfort when I move my right eye in any way (right, left, up, down). In addition, I've been having pain on my right side that seemed to have moved up, and now it's completely gone, but my right eye is suffering. I'm not sure if the two are related but maybe? I've been having headaches as well. I'm 21 years old, I don't wear glasses (maybe I need them?), female, and confused lol. I read something about graves eye disease? could this be it? I think that I do have a thyroid issue (I'm overweight, which is a cause, right?) as indicated by doctors in the past, and I know that plays some role in graves. Just in need of some help, here. Thanks!",
