            "answer": "I don't remember exactly what I ate when I got that 135, but I do remember it was after dinner and I ate a plain chocolate bar for dessert thinking of stressing the BG. Also I took that particular measurement about 1hr 15mins afterwards, so the peak could've been above 135.I am surprized at how narrow the range of fasting and the in-between meals BG levels is (88-96).All the readings seem to be at the high end of normal.I am taking this seriously, going to cut out all sweets and alcohol from my diet and see if it starts making any difference to the readings.",

    "question": "Just did a fasting glucose test in a lab and it came back at 108, which is pre-diabetes according to the chart.But I am at a healthy weight and run 6 miles every morning. So whatever the recommended lifestyle changes are, I am already doing more.Also no family history of diabetes. Could there be something external factor that contributed to that high reading?Going to buy a home kit and retest myself in a couple of weeks, but just wanted to know",
