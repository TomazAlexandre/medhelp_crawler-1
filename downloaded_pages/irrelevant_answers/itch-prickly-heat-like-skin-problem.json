    "question": "I am a 79 year old and have been experiencing burning, prickly itchy skin since October 2013. I am itching from the top of my head to to the top of my feet. It feels like a light case of sunburn or like a razor burn after shaving.The sensation will be symmetrical, i.e. both arms, both sides of the head or face or ears. The prickly heat turns into an itching with sensations of pin pricking. Once the itching starts it is very hard to get it under control.\u00a0\u00a0I've used\u00a0\u00a0benedryl with no results of relieving the itch. When my skin itches there is\u00a0\u00a0no real visible rash. I had been using the popular anti bacterial soap for my daily showers for years with no sing of abatement. Then a lady told me to give Dove soap a try. I think she thought I had a dry skin problem. So since January of 2014 I've been using Dove with fairly good results for my daily showers. If, after I towel myself dry and there are parts of me that still itch I've come to know that I've missed soaping up and washing that area. So I'm learning to be sure to wash every part of me with Dive even the tops of my feet. Yes the itch comes back slightly during the day to a much lesser degree and at fewer spots. I also keep a dry sliver of Dove soap near by and rub it on the itchy spot. The spot in question usually quits itching in a matter of a few seconds. I'm fairly comfortable these days and have contained my itchy skin to a high degree. But I'd still like to know what's causing the original itchy prickly heat like skin problem I have. Please.",
