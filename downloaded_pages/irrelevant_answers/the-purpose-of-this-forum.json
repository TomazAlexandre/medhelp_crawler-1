            "answer": "I agree totally.\u00a0\u00a0I think what bothers me is that I know how it feels to be desperate about being overweight and wishing that I could lose the weight rapidly and even though we are all adults here and capable of making our own decisions, I think it is possible to feel so distraught and vulnerable that people can be easily enticed into trying methods that are less than ideal.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, to be honest, the people I have known that have used diet pills have not \"shouted it from the mountaintops\" but have been rather discrete so when I see posters hawking these products it makes me very uncomfortable, like they are making a sales pitch or something.\u00a0\u00a0Like you said, if people are interested in alternative methods to weight loss MedHelp offers a forum for that.",

    "question": "Its clear that there are a lot of proponents of chemically assisted weight loss here.\u00a0\u00a0This forum, however, is not for that purpose.\u00a0\u00a0There is another forum, called WEIGHT LOSS ALTERNATIVES, that is for discussion of supplements, surgery, and other assisted methods.Here is the purpose of this forum, as stated on the front page of the forum:\"This forum is an un-mediated, patient-to-patient forum for questions and support regarding dieting issues such as: Alcohol and Dieting, Balanced Menus, Diabetes and Diet, Dieting Success Stories, Exercise, Metabolism, Healthy Dieting, Healthy Snacks, Holiday Tips for Dieters, Nutrition as well as discussions around particular diet plans like South Beach Diet, Atkins Diet, Slim-Fast, Weight Watchers, MedHelp, Counting Calories, Fat Flush, Body for Life and others.\"Rather than clog up this forum with discussions of what pill will help you lose weight the fastest, it would be helpful to move pill discussions to the forum where others may be more supportive.",
