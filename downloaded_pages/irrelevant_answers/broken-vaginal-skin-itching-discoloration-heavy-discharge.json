    "question": "vaginal discoloration/itching/broken skin,Hi,I have several symptoms of irritation around my vaginal area.First off, I have intense discharge once a month, I know that is normal, but it's really intense discharge. It doesn't have a funny smell, but it does have cottage cheese like consistency. It goes away after about 3 days though.For the past month I've been experiencing severe itching around my rectum. More on the outside than the inside though. This lead to an itch of my vaginal area. Then I found a cut between the anus and the vagina, presumably from itching, but possibly not?Additionally (and most worrying of all) I noticed parts of my vulva, specifically the lips, have gone very white in a color.I'm terrified of doctors, please tell me what this may be",
