            "answer": "hiyeah i know what you mean, it is very depressing,pbc is primary bilary cirrosis, its a liver condition and is classed as an autoimmune liver disease, somthing can trigger it of like an infection,all you need is a ama (anti mitrochondiral antibody) blood test if its positivemost likely you have it, its not seen much in men quite rare. its a slow disease takes a while for it to cause alot of symptoms, no cure for it, i have heard there is medication to slow it down to some point.try milk thistle (its herbal), its good for your liver, it protects the liver, i heard people with cirrosis take it, thats if your not on medication, if you are it can interact so be careful with it.the dry mouth and dry eyes can come from another condition that can be due to having this condition and a few other conditions, what colour is your tongue? do you have alot of cracks, does your tongue, mouth burn? hard to swallow? feeling thirsty i heard can be a sign of diabetes too.",

    "question": "hii have messaged a few times on here, i dont believe many specialist,drs,people are familiar with PBCcondition, i am male in my early 30s form uk. My story is, in 2004 i believe i suffered from prostatitis which is still being checked (due to my lack of concern)i\u00a0\u00a0do remeber being in hospital and my liver enzymes were high only the ALT and AST alt in the 90s and ast in 50s, now this was not investigated, i wasnt checked properly and i have been suffering from chronic prostratitis and other symptoms even though i have been checked for stds and utis and was neg.i did have a ultrasound 3 years ago the liver was fine on ultrasound, i began to drink alcohol last year and i began to get symtoms of stomach pains, dry eyes (caused inflamation, floaters)dry mouth and very severe no known reason, also pains and dizzyness alot of panic attacks,my gp sent me for a ultrasound as he said my liver enzymes have been mildly high for a number of years i inly found out about this when the gp told me.on ultrasound it shows fatty liver was also told it was inflamed (can inflamation of the liver be seen on ultrasound?)i was refered to a hepatologist who didnt really look at my history and baled everything on fatty liver,m i told him no my liver only recently shows fatty, but he told me no and told me to lose weight and eat healthy.i was also tested for AMA and it was positive, titre 40, this was ignored by this liver dr too, maybe he did other tests to confirm it? i am goin to chase this up with him soon, i also have a gallbladder issue not stones ontop blood amaylaise is mildly raised too pointing to the pancreas also i am suffergin from gastritis and deodunum ulcers including a bacterial infection,i have dry eyes, dry mouth, joint pains, fatigue, even get itchy skin, suffering from depression, anxiety too, i did see a optician who also confirmed yellow tint on my eyes along with dry eyes, i was tested for bilirubin and the levels are in normal range.if i was to summarise everything,positive for ama antibodies on titre 40dry eyes (confirmed) and mouthjoint pains,weakness, letargic, confusion,brainfog (all this could be anxiety and depression)yellow tint in the eyes and itching ( bilirubin normal levels)recently have fatty liver i believe this is alcoholic related as it occured after i started drinking alcohol and stopped (only for 8 month period)from he results i could say i have pbc as there is not other cause for liver enzymes to be mildly high, i have added fatty liver\u00a0\u00a0on top of this last year due to the drink (causing the worsening of my symptoms).and the rest of the symptoms go along with another autoimmune disorder known as Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndromepbcfatty liverSj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndromei also have read there are triggers for pbc, could be chemical or a bacterial infection, could the prostratitis have triggered this off? i am going to a urologist at the end of next month to get a cure for that issue.its just ashame not many people know about pbc condition.",
