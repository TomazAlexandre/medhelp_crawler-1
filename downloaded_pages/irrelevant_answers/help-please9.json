            "answer": "Hi!First get your sister\u2019s blood pressure checked. This could be due to high blood pressure. The other possibility is clot in some blood vessel. This can also give out heat sensation without there being any temperature. Hyperthyroidism, diabetes, temporal arteritis are the other possibilities. It can also be an allergic reaction to some soap or oil etc. In females it could also be due to hormonal imbalance as in polycystic ovary.Please first consult your family doctor to run tests to rule out the above possibilities.
