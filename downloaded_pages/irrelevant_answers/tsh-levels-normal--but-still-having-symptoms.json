            "answer": "Up until 2003 the scale was .4 - 6.0 but in 2003 the American Assoc of Clinical Endocrinologists revised it to .3 -3.0 for a normal range.\u00a0\u00a0So many doctors and labs still after 5 years go by the old range, (including my old PCP and their lab).\u00a0\u00a0Its very frustrating.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ATA shows .4- 2.5 as a normal range, 2.5 - 4.0 as an at risk range, 4.0 - 10.0 subclinical hypothyroidism and > 10.0 hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0Once they start treating you, most endos will try and get you down in the normal range.Can you get a referral to an endo?",
