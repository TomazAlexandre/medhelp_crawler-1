    "question": "I was diagnosed a year ago.\u00a0\u00a0My gp put me on metformin. That had been an up and down hill ride sure to my ibs. My dosage was listed and Juniata added.\u00a0\u00a0I'm still having days where I don't have the energy to stay awake in the afternoons other days I struggle to keep my eyes open and have fallen asleep while driving. On these\u00a0\u00a0days it's like my eyes are rolling back in my head among I just can't fight the sleep. I've limit my carbs\u00a0\u00a0to no more than 40g a meal. What am I doing wrong? Any advise is appreciated.",
