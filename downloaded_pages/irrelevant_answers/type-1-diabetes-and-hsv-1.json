            "answer": "I have type 1 diabetes and have had genetal HSV-1.\u00a0\u00a0Swollen, red, ulcers does not sound like what I had.\u00a0\u00a0I had about 4 tiny little blisters, individual, spread out, not grouped and you could really tell they were blisters.\u00a0\u00a0The good news is that they never came back and it's been ten years...I'm interested in this \"fragile tissue\" that you mentioned though.\u00a0\u00a0I tear frequently and have made an appointment to see a gynecologist next month as it interferes with my sex life.\u00a0\u00a0What were you told to use to treat the tears?",

    "question": "I'm 31 and have had type 1 diabetes for 16 years - so far, no complications.\u00a0\u00a0I've struggled over the last year with Interstitial Cystitis symptoms (had pelvic floor therapy) and recurrent group B strep in urine cultures.It is common for me to experience a small tear in my perineum area and it usually takes a week to heal.\u00a0\u00a0I've been told this is because I have fragile tissue due to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It's been a week since I last \"tore\" and it hasn't healed.\u00a0\u00a0Yesterday I developed extremely painful, red, swollen genital ulcers.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the doctor today and she took cultures for HSV-1 and HSV-2, but I won't get the results for several days.I've had canker sores ever since I can remember and I had a small one a week ago which I treated with kenalog paste.\u00a0\u00a0It's probable that I have oral HSV-1 given the canker sores although I've never had a fever blister/cold sore. I'm an avid hand-washer, but somehow, is it possible that I gave MYSELF genital HSV-1?\u00a0\u00a0Or, can genital ulcers be a symptom of GBS gone wild?Thanks for your consideration - you can imagine I'm a bit anxious.",
