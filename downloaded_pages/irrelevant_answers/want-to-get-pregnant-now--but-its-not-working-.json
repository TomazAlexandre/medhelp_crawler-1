            "answer": "Metformin often takes a few months to regulate your hormones. So be patient. And as far as the side effects go, often the brand name has less than generic metformin so if you are on generic I would ask the doc to switch. I took clomid for 6 months, conceived 1x but had very early pregnancy loss. I don't contribute it to the clomid though. I would never even have known I had conceived if I hadn't been going to the RE where they take a blood test 12 days after ovulation- I miscarried on the day my period was due. BUT PLEASE PLEASE do not take clomid with a regular obgyn- go to an RE. Clomid can cause ovarian cysts and the regular docs do not perform regular u/s whereas the RE will do an u/s every few days. It can be dangerous if not closely monitored.",

            "answer": "Hmmmm. I don't think so, but that is a question for the doctor. They usually say that missing a period or having a really late period is a sign that ovulation did not happen. But the metformin may help with all of this. If not, you may need other drugs to cause ovulation and menstruation. If you really do not want to take clomid, you can see an RE and take injectables. I took those too for 3 months. The difference with them is that instead of using a drug that \"tricks your brain\" like clomid, they are actually just the hormones (in excess) that your body needs to produce to grow the follicles and ovulate. But they come with their own wonderful side effects plus the fact you inject them into your abdomen. I would recommend scheduling a consult with a specialist- that doesn't mean you go through with any treatments, but they may do more extensive testing.",

I am currently taking Metformin and i dont even want to be doing this but like i said i want to get preg now. I will talk to many many more doctors before. I just hope metformin will help! Also i just got blood tests done and the doc told me my hormone levels look great.\u00a0\u00a0I know this might be a reall y stupid question but\u00a0\u00a0 Can you ovulate without having a period??",

    "question": "Hello! I am 24 years old and am trying to get pregnant. I have PCOS, Underactive thyroid and diabetes. Which with all of these symtoms it seems impossible to ever get pregnant. My doctor told me to start on Metformin, but my goodness it is making me SO SO sick. I have not had my period for almost 3 years now. so taking this metformin and trying to determine basil body temps and all of the other things. My doctor sounds confident with this whole metformin thing 3x a day and have sex every other day but i have for a month now. And as far as i know i am not pregnant because i have had absolutly NO symptoms to even check. Clomid sounds too scary because of such a high increase in miscarriages. but i really want to get pregnant now.\u00a0\u00a0What should i do?? HELP ME??!!",
