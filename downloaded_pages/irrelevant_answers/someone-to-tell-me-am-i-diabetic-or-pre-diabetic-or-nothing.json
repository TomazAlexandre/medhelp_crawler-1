            "answer": "Hi,People can be more sensitive to carbs at different times of the day.\u00a0\u00a0Seems that you are less able to handle carbohydrates at breakfast, than at lunch time.Next time, try having breakfast without bread.\u00a0\u00a0Have your eggs, cheese, some saut\u00e9ed vegetables or some sausage / bacon etc.This approach is called eat to your meter.\u00a0\u00a0Basically you see how\u00a0\u00a0your blood sugar is after eating and then you modify your meal accordingly.High blood sugar is always addressed by reducing how much carbs you eat.\u00a0\u00a0In order to have enough calories you may replace the carbs with more protein and / or fats.Hope this helps.",
