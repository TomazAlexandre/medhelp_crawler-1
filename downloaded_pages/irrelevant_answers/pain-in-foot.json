    "question": "My 80 year old mother had TKR surgery last week.\u00a0\u00a0She says when she stands or sits for any length of time, her foot hurts and she must lay down to relieve the pain.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor said this is typical because of blood rushing to the foot and recommended putting the support sock on.Has anyone else experienced this? Everyone is impressed with her flexibility and she's doing her exercises regularly but this pain has really gotten her concerned and regrets getting the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0How long can she expect this pain to stay?Thank you.",
