Normal labs doesn't mean normal if you have pain or symptoms.....but I realize now I need to insist to my dr that I need to tweak my dosage just a little bit up at a time until symptoms vanish......and I am amazed at just a tiny tiny tiny bit more can make a world of difference symptoms wise......I learned totally by accident......",
