            "answer": "hello,mixed insulin is a mixture of long and short acting insulin.\u00a0\u00a0You must eat on a fixed schedule and fixed amount of carbs, protein and fat, with mixed insulins.\u00a0\u00a0If you do not eat on time you will go low. Basically you have to eat to match the insulin.A more modern approach is to take the short and long acting insulins separately.\u00a0\u00a0The long acting insulin is taken once or twice a day depending on the type of insulin.\u00a0\u00a0This is called basal insulin and keeps your blood sugar stable even when you don't eat.\u00a0\u00a0Then you dose bolus (fast acting) insulin just before you eat.\u00a0\u00a0With the amount of insulin dosed depending on h ow much carbs and protein you eat.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't eat you don't dose this insulin.\u00a0\u00a0You can also vary the dose depending on what you are eating.\u00a0\u00a0For basal bolus, you match the insulin to what you eat.I highly recommend you look at using a basal-bolus regime.\u00a0\u00a0It should give much better control.When I was first diagnosed with diabetes I was on basal-bolus.\u00a0\u00a0I had one very serious low. I hated it as there was no flexibility in eating. I then changed to basal-bolus and not only did I have much better control and excellent flexibility, I no longer have any serious lows.",
