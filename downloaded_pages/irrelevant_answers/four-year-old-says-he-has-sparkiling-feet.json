            "answer": "take him to a Podiatrist. My son complained as a 2 year old that his feet hurt. Of course we always thought he said it because he wanted to be carried. It wasn't until he was 7 that I decided to get them looked at. Turned out his body was growing too quickly for his achilles tendons to keep up. We opted to try stretching him out before surgery. By doing that we avoid surgery, and he doesn't complain anymore. Podiatrists are very good and will do anything to avoid surgery. Take him in you have nothing to loose except worry.",

            "answer": "Dear Lisa,I'm so glad you will have your son tested for diabetes! Some people think that very early drinking of COW'S MILK (among other things) can cause an auto-immune reaction, which destroys the insulin producing cells of the pancreas, causing juvenile diabetes.If your son does have diabetes, I urge you to read a very enlightening book called \"REVERSING DIABETES\", by Dr. Julian Whitaker, M.D. You may find this book extremely helpful, if your son does have diabetes!Follow Lor's suggestions too, but also keep in mind that diabetes can cause \"peripheral neuropathy\" (nerve damage, outside of the brain & spinal cord), which can cause the tingling sensations.It's good to follow up on SEVERAL possible underlying causes of your son's symptoms!Good luck to you and your son!Sincerely, Concerned ladyhttp://cantbreathesuspectvcd.com",

            "answer": "Hi Again!Something new just found today! My son said his neck hurt, so I offered to message it for him. I began in the back, and he said no mom right here, and pointed to the back behind his left ear. I found a lump or what seems to be a few lumps about two of my fingers big. Of course I am frightened. It hurts him, so I don't know if that means anything (such as just regular swollen glands) or worse. What do you think?Thanks...Lisa",

            "answer": "Dear Lisa,Others may have some ideas for you, too, about this.I think that when you bring your son to the doctor Tuesday, for diabetes testing, you need to show those painful LUMPS to the doctor at the same time!!!It may be nothing, and then your fears will be relieved, OR, it may be something that needs treating, so that you can catch whatever it is EARLY, AND FIX IT! :-)Not being a doc, I don't know what the lumps are, but it is very normal for you to be worried.\u00a0\u00a0There are treatment choices for whatever your son has, including gentle natural methods! :-)Meanwhile, if you are worried enough, and if you feel like it would be better (safer) not to wait, --just go to a good Emergency Room, and ask them what they think is going on, with the lumps behind your son's left ear. Let us know what happens with the possible diabetes, and the lumps behind his ear.Hang in there! You are a good mother. Your son is lucky that you are working on helping him! :-)Sincerely, Concerned ladyhttp://cantbreathesuspectvcd.com",

He asked if I was okay after. Isn't he a sweet precious doll? They took four viles of blood to check for anemia, iron levels, diabetes, and I don't know what else. The doctor didn't seem to think his symptoms were diabetes. He did slip his tounge a little. He said if it were diabetes, it is MUCH more serious in children. Then he said...oops, I should have said that. I think my look of horror must have tipped him off. Did I mention that I had problems when my daughter broke her finger, and when he snapped it back into position, I fainted...hehe...Ya think I love my kids at all...haha. I will keep you posted if the doctor calls me. He will only calls if something is wrong.Thanks for supporting me!!Sincerely, Lisa",

He said if I am worried, to take him to emerg. The doctor said today, that my son has a viral throat infection that will go away on its own.On the phone the doctor said the cell count could be from the infection. Being the paranoid mother I am, I looked up cell counts on the internet, and yes it can be infection, or leukemia. I need some more information...I can deal with it, but God, I need to know!All his symptoms say something is wrong, pale, sunkin eyes, thin, tired all the time. The boy sleeps over twelve hours, then has a three hour nap. He beggs for a nap. What child at age four does that??? My mother gut screams this is serious.Sincerely scared now...Lisa",

            "answer": "Dear Lisa,Some other SPECIALISTS you may want to see are:1) Pediatric GI (gastro-intestinal doc) because your son eats a lot, but is THIN (unless this is just his body type)2) Pediatric Neurologist--because of the neurological symptom of TINGLING FEET!3) Infectious specialist--to find out what type of infection he has, how he got it, and what to do about it.Hang in there!

            "answer": "Dear Lisa,What kind of doctor did you see today, with your son? Was he or she a GP (General Practitioner) or ?? When will you get the results of the diabetes test?I think your \"mother gut\" is right. You need to find out the results of EVERY test they did on your son's blood. Call the doctor Wednesday, and ask for ALL the results.I also think that your son sleeping that much, looking pale, thin, sunken eyes, tired all the time--is NOT NORMAL!!!How long has your son had these symptoms? Did they start suddenly, or come on gradually? What happened around the time that these symptoms started?Did your son have any kind of VACCINATION shortly before all these symptoms started?What was different, in his life, around the time that all these symptoms began?Here are some questions, to give you some food for thought:1) Do you live in a NEW home, or REMODELED home, or OLD home? Is your son ever in DAY CARE (NEW or REMODELED building)?2) Do you have NEW CARPETS, NEW TILE, NEW INSULATION, NEW PARTICLE-BOARD, NEW MATTRESS, NEW UPHOLSTRY, NEW PAINT, NEW \"STAIN\", NEW DRYWALL/PLASTER? All of these NEW things, usually give off toxic (poisonous) fumes, for YEARS!3) Are your windows always CLOSED? Can they open? Is your ventilation system bad? Has any air conditioning system been checked to see what might be \"growing\" in there?4) Might you have a toxic MOLD problem in your home? Has your home been tested for TOXIC MOLD? Leaks or floods can cause MOLD to grow, in the basement, crawl space, walls, under carpets, under floors, in attics, etc.5) Has your home (or lawn, or garden, or yard, etc.) been SPRAYED or TREATED by \"Pest Control\" chemicals? (for termites, other bugs or insects, rodents, etc.)6) Is your son being exposed to \"TOXIC SYNTHETIC FRAGRANCES\" & other toxins/poisons? Examples are:a) DRY CLEANING FUMESb) \"AIR FRESHENERS\" like Glade \"plug ins\" or SPRAYSc) SPRAYS of bacteria killing \"cleansers\", & SPRAYS in generald) MOTH BALLS (very poisonous)e) Scented products of all kinds7) Do you live near any industry or business that causes AIR or WATER POLLUTION? (like chemical factories, film manufactureres, etc., places that cause a lot of chemical dust, AGRICULTURAL PESTICIDES, like insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, etc.)8) Has your son ever been seen by a very good ALLERGIST? What area are you in (in case I know of any docs in your area)?9) What kinds of foods does your son eat? What does he drink? He may be allergic or intolerant to some of these foods & beverages. Does he get food from someplace besides your home? What kind of water is in your home? (city, well, filtered?)10) Does your son have digestive problems, like diarrhea? constipation? Has he been tested (blood test) for CELIAC DISEASE? (GLUTEN INTOLERANCE). Does he eat a lot of wheat products (bread, etc.)? There's a lot of gluten in wheat. Brown rice (organic) has no gluten. People with Celiac Disease have to avoid gluten in their diets.You may need to be a little like Sherlock Holmes, to help figure out what's going on, in addition to getting medical help.If you don't get enough help from the doctor you saw, you need to see SEVERAL SPECIALIST DOCTORS (like an Allergist, an Endocrinologist, about possible diabetes, etc., a specialist in ENVIRONMENTAL & OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, etc.)What did the doctor say was the reason your son had several LUMPS behind his ear???Lisa, you ARE going to get all this figured out! Have faith that you will be able to help your little boy to get well! :-)Sincerely, Concerned ladyhttp://cantbreathesuspectvcd.com",

            "answer": "The doctor was just a family doctor who wasn'r worried at all. Hesaid the lumps were from a virus (throat) infection. He used to have chronic ear infections and got tubes, and he never acted like this before. A silly throat infection would not make him sleep this much, and look that way. He's been having fevers on and off too. That's a new symptom.Our house is 20 years old. No new carpets. Sarnia, Ontario is basically a big factory of polluting plants. I live in Canada. I looked up what blood cell count is about and for an infection, I read low teen is okay. He is in the high teens with 19.5. Even though I have no idea what that means.I know it scares me.I painted his room about 6 months ago with paint especially for kids thinking I was a good parent. The ventalation system (don't know). His window can open, but being a paranoid mother< I made it only open so far so he can't fall out (there is cement and rose bushes below his window).My gut is screaming. I am calling my family doctor this morning at 9:00am when he opens. I am asking about what that number of cells means. I am also going to request a specialist. His grandma really freaked out when I called her. She demanded I take him to emerg. But I didn't knowing they will do nothing. Sarnia is a tiny town. To get serious help we should go to London, Ontario. That we may do!(Pardon my spelling) I'm freaking out, unable to think.What do you think my baby has? Diabetes scared me before, but Now I fear worse.",
