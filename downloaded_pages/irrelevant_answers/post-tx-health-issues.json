I personally didn\u2019t experience any notable long term issues as a result of IFN therapy, but there certainly are others that report problems very similar to the ones you\u2019re describing, and will hopefully weigh in later. Perhaps you can compare notes with them and see what steps they\u2019ve taken to help manage symptoms.I hope you\u2019re having a relatively pain-free and peaceful weekend so far\u2014--Bill",

            "answer": "I'm about a year post treatment and it took me about 6 months post treatment to pull off Neupogen completely, but I guess I was a more severe case since I also took thyroid meds that further suppressed the bone marrow.\u00a0\u00a0Pegasys/ Riba also gave me thyroid issues, mostly have resolved by now, but as I've been reading my TSH, it seems like it's increasing very slowly so hope the problems won't return for good *fingers crossed*.Before I started treatment however, docs did warn me that if there were any hereditary diseases that would appear later in life affecting the person treating, the meds could bring out the symptoms at an earlier stage.\u00a0\u00a0For example diabetes etc.\u00a0\u00a0Also, did you get your eyes screened before treatment?\u00a0\u00a0Some side effects include eye issues such as bleeding etc.I definitely felt like I experienced depression post treatment, but was never treated for it.\u00a0\u00a0It's just important to get oneself back to normal as soon as possible continue routines and take a vacation have some fun bc you truly deserve it.Good luck",

    "question": "Hi All,I am new to this. Just wondering if anyone out there post interferon / ribavirin therapy for Hep. C is or has been having continued health issues? I have never fully recovered, in that I still experience severe chronic joint & muscle pain, fatigue, headaches, nausea, decreased appetite, depression, numbness in my fingers, trouble sleeping...I could probably go on. Any help, support or suggestions would greatly be appreciated.",
