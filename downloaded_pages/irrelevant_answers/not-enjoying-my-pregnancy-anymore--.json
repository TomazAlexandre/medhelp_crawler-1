Can you not call your DR and get them to explain to you exactly what is happening? I did read your last comment and it seemed as though your DR was not concerned but I really think the only way to put your mind at ease is to speak to them again and ask any questions that you have. I know it's easier said than done but don't worry I'm sure everything is fine. No point worrying yourself sick, call your DR x",

            "answer": "I am so sorry to hear this. Hope you talk to your doctor soon about this but the safest way is to get an appointment from another doctor who can perform an anomaly/anatomy scan for the measurements. You will have to spent some money for the scanning but it's worth as you are depressed at this moment. Depression or worrying will not do any good to you and your baby. And what I think is your baby should be alright although her legs look shorter in the ultrasound as not all ultrasound measurements are accurate. And after reading your post I just googled to see if that's normal in other discussion threads and found out that A lot of mommas\u00a0\u00a0than you think have experienced the same situation of yours about their babies legs being smaller in the ultrasound and their babies born perfectly normal. So just pray from God and relax hun. Relaxing will make you feel better and won't elevate your blood pressure.",

They are simply petite little girl!!!I would try not to stress and worry, it isn't good for either you or your baby. Ultrasounds are not 100% accurate, if your ultrasound tech/ doctor did not voice any concerns then I am sure that your little one is perfectly fine :)It is a worry though, but children are and I think we will be worried about them even when they are grown with families of their own.All the best!",
