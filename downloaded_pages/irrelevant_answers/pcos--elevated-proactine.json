            "answer": "for prolactine i use , cabergoline . and do you know if you get checked for insulin levels , because there are few other things whihc may help with the fertility , like if you have hihg insulin and overweight even losing few kilos may boost your fertility ,\u00a0\u00a0if he thinks you can not get pregnant because of your high prolactine levels i dont think you need 6-8 months . it can be much sooner because i know when i use my medicines regularly my prolactine levels drop fast . you didnt list folic acid you should use is aswell if you arent already . not to boost fertility but its good to take if you are trying to get pregnant to prevent some birth defects . good luck !",
