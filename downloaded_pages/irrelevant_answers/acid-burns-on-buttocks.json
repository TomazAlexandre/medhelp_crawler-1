            "answer": "Difficult to say without evaluation.Seeing a dermatologist can be done to see if this is an abnormal skin lesion.It also seems that the healing process is slowed for some reason.\u00a0\u00a0Diseases like diabetes and vascular disease can also impede the healing process.If the affected skin is exposed to the diarrhea, this can worsen the condition.\u00a0\u00a0Discussing whether a dressing or barrier to the damage skin would help should be discussed.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

    "question": "About 15 mos ago a friend thought I did not eat enough vegetables and so she fixed\u00a0\u00a0me a lot of them for several days. After 3-4 days I got diarrhea. It\u00a0\u00a0seemed that after a day or two I was still \"burning\" back in the buttocks area.\u00a0\u00a0It turns out that now I have a grape-fruit sized area on both buttocks like scar tissue and no new skin will grow there, when new skin tries to grow it just dries up after a couple days and flakes off.\u00a0\u00a0This area is dark red in color.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I try and help the dead skin flake away by picking at it, of course,sometimes this causes a little bleeding. Will any scar tissue ever form over this area?\u00a0\u00a0Have you h eard of this problem before? I'm sure this was all caused by some very strong acid in the diarrehea.\u00a0\u00a0My question is what can I do now??",
