            "answer": "I don't think it's genital herpes either. It doesn't itch all the time like your issue, it will burn and hurt if anything. I don't know why your docs are insisting that it is, with this prolonged itchy rash. You need to start from scratch...sorry no pun intended :) and go see your doc or a new one and thoroughly explain what you did here. The famvir and valtrex aren't going to help if you don't have what they're treating you for.There is a woman here who knows her stuff inside and out. Her name is Grace. Hopefully she can help guide you from here on out.Best of luck!",

            "answer": "yeah just visual diagnosis of herpes, also when they looked at it they saw my wounds from me scratching all the time especially when i sleep, they probably mistook that for herpes lesions,I have never tried any kind of topical anti fungal creams or any other kind of cream, i just thought i have herpes, my balls don't look like any other herpes pics i saw before, but they look more similar to that jock itch thing,I'm guessing i should get a second opinion from another Doctorwell this gives me some hope that I don't, But i'm not gonna get my hopes to highThanks grace and fission\u00a0\u00a0 (>\")> ~~~~ yay ~~~~~ <(\"<)",

If you have the antobody IgG then you had herpes before, if IgM is high then you got a recent infection. Btw, diabetes from dirty balls? lol Who was that dumb doctor?",

    "question": "Hi, I was just wondering if i'm still supposed to be having a genital itch when taking the 500mg daily dose famvir for genital herpes? also I'm wondering If I actually do have genital herpes?It all started when I was 18, I was working out in the Bush, brush cutting for a few weeks, didn't have time to shower much, slept in my jeans a lot, had sweat between my thighs and such anyways, then after a few weeks i started getting this burning itch, between my thighs, then slowly moved to my balls, there was no redness, or lesions or bumps, after a day, I noticed these red line bumps on my inner thigh, pretty much close to the balls, itchy kinda sore, after that my balls were dam itchy and my inner thighs get itchy, i've seen my doctor about it he looked at it and thought it was diabetes for some odd reason, got bloodwork done, it was fine, anyways i kept myself clean after that, still was itchy pretty much everyday, more when i sweated, I would scratch myself till it bled, after a year of this I went to the hospital emergency because it was so itchy i had scratched till i had open sores and had got a skin infection i asked them what it was and was told i had genital herpes, they gave me valtrex which caused me to have hives, so i didn't take them after the first day of taking them, oh the doctors also gave me cephalex for my infection, i took all that, which made me feel better and less itchy in my genitals and thighs, after that i got itchy again kept scratching, but less than before to avoid a trip to the emerge.Now 4 years later still have itchy balls, thighs itch but only a little, my balls are kinda bumpy, the skin on my balls is kinda leathery thick, I'm on famvir now still have itchy balls even when i take it, also I scratch in my sleep sometimes, it wakes me up, because my balls are to itchy, I scratch so much sometimes it leaves open sores then it gets more itchy, I try to keep clean down there but i sit down a lot causing me to get sweat between my thighs and and balls,the itch seems to worsen when its sweaty, also has a funny odor to it, i got a skin infection recently again from scratching too much, especially when i'm sleeping, also sometime in between my thighs pretty much the groin area of the inner thighs has a crack which is itchy i put peroxide on it to help it heal, One thing thats odd is that even when i'm told i have Genital Herpes, your supposed to get lesion which appear right? mine are usually from scratching to much,well other than that thanks for reading.
