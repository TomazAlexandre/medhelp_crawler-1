            "answer": "Vitamin D needs to be at least 32ng/mL to absorb calcium and between 40 to 60 ng/mL for cancer prevention.\u00a0\u00a0Ferritin that low can cause hair loss as well.I felt SO bad when I was pre diabetic. I already had severe insulin resistance to start with due to a high % of sugar in my diet (not that I overate) but was pre diabetic due to hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone in the blood). As I found out the hard way, high insulin prevents weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0I also had plenty of symptoms from magnesium deficiency since excess insulin/blood glucose can cause excess magnesium to be excreted.Excerpt from Primary Care Physicans - Pre Diabetes...\"Many people with pre-diabetes suffer no identifiable symptoms of which they are aware. However, some do have episodes of hypoglycemia, which can cause periods of lightheadedness or dizziness, hot flashes or chills, tremors in the hands, anxiety or nervousness, headaches, sweats, palpitations (sensation of a rapid or irregular heart beat), and fatigue or exhaustion. Body aches may also occur, as do occasional painful muscle spasms (such as \"charlie horses\"), abdominal cramps, urgency to urinate or defecate, nausea, and sometimes other gastrointestinal symptoms. Mood swings are also frequent with rapid variations in blood sugar, and patients may experience emotional highs and lows all occurring within a 30 to 120 minute period. \"",
