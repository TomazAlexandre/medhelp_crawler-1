            "answer": "A Japanese study evaluated the effect of aloe vera gel on blood sugar. Researchers isolated a number of active phytosterol compounds from the gel that were found to reduce blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels. But what study? The study isn''t named. And what researchers? Uncle Bob and Auntie May next door? I dislike reports that do not provide specific names or proof of documentation to back up the test findings. I take these reports as Internet rumors. Who knows if the research was performed on lab rats or humans. If the latter, one needs to question why doctors aren\u2019t standing up and tooting their horns for aloe helping to lower glucose levels. Is yours? Mine isn\u2019t.Aloe vera has been used topically for thousands of years to treat wounds, skin infections, burns, and numerous other dermatologic conditions. Don\u2019t get me wrong for I use aloe to treat sunburns and it does work. But to lower glucose levels, I think the jury is still out. Furthermore, this is a quote from Yahoo Answers (hopefully I\u2019m not breaking any laws by copying from their web site). \u201cTaking Aloe vera in liquid form orally seems to reduce blood glucose levels, though marginally. Dose: about 15 ml (one table spoon) twice daily.\u201dNo harm in trying if you wish to pursue drinking aloe vera to lower your glucose levels then report back here in 6 months with your results. I would be interested, and I feel other readers too, in hearing from you.",
