The efficacy of combination therapy with ribavirin and interferon for chronic HCV infection in elderly patients has not been fully clarified. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy in such patients. Methods: Two hundred twenty consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis C were treated with combination therapy. These patients were divided into two groups according to age: patients = 60 years (n = 66) and patients < 60 years (n = 154). Clinical characteristics, the sustained virologic response (SVR) rate obtained by intention-to-treat analysis, and the rate of reduction or discontinuation of ribavirin were compared between the two groups. Results: The hemoglobin level was significantly lower in patients aged = 60 years than in patients aged < 60 years (p = 0.0056). Creatinine clearance in patients aged = 60 years was worse than that in patients aged < 60 years (P < 0.0001). However other clinical characteristics of patients were not significantly difference between two groups. The ribavirin discontinuation rate was significantly higher in the patients aged = 60 years than in the patients aged < 60 years. However, the SVR rates did not differ significantly between patients aged = 60 years and those aged < 60 years (31.8% vs 38.3% by intention-to-treat analysis). According to multivariate analysis, genotype and HCV viral load were significantly associated with SVR while patient age did not affect SVR. Conclusions: Treatment of chronic hepatitis C with combination therapy was comparably effective between patients aged = 60 years and those aged < 60 years in the same grade of hepatitis, although the ribavirin discontinuation rate was higher among the older patients than among the younger patients.",

Fung 1, C.L. Lai 1, J.C. Yuen 1, D.K. Wong 1, C.T. Cheng 1, D.Y. But 1, M.F. Yuen 11 Department Of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, University Of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong-S.A.R., ChinaBackground and Aim: The prevalence of fibrosis in a large population of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients is not known. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of significant fibrosis in a Chinese population with CHB by liver stiffness measurement (LSM), and its correlation with liver biochemistry and demographic factors.Methods: All CHB patients seen at Hepatitis Clinic, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong for CHB between January to July 2006 with LSM by transient elastography were included.Results: Of the 898 patients included with a median age of 44, 323 (36%) had significant fibrosis as defined by LSM of >8.1 kPa. Males had a higher median liver stiffness measurement (MLSM) than females (7.3 vs 5.9 kPa, p<0.001), and those positive for HBeAg had higher MLSM than HBeAg-negative patients (7.3 and 6.4 kPa respectively, p=0.017). In patients =25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-55, 56-65, and >65 years of age, the MLSM was 6.0, 6.0, 6.4, 7.6, 8.7and 11.6 kPa respectively (p<0.001), with 56% of those aged over 55 years having significant fibrosis. LSM scores correlated well with serum bilirubin, ALT, AFP, and albumin levels (all p<0.001). In patients with ALT<0.5 upper limit of normal (ULN), 0.5-1xULN, 1-2xULN, 2-5xULN and >5xULN, the MLSM was 5.7, 6.7, 8.4, 11.7 and 19.1 kPa respectively (p<0.001). After multivariate analysis, age, bilirubin, ALT, albumin and gender remained significant factors associated with significant fibrosis. Using a combination of serum ALT, bilirubin and albumin levels to predict the presence of significant fibrosis, the sensitivity and specificity were 19% and 98% respectively, with positive predictive value of 84% and negative predictive value of 96%.Conclusion: The prevalence of significant fibrosis in Chinese CHB patients was high, affecting more than half of the patients over the age of 55 years. LSM correlated well with known factors associated with more severe disease, including older age, male sex, higher bilirubin and ALT, and lower albumin. The combination of serum bilirubin, ALT and albumin levels may be used to predict significant underlying fibrosis.",

Michallon, Grenoble, FranceLiver stiffness measurement with the Fibroscan is a non invasive method that assesses the severity of chronic liver disease, in particular fibrosis, in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Whether or not the virologic response to antiviral therapy is associated with concomitant changes in liver stiffness remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess the dynamics of liver stiffness relative to the dynamics of the virologic response during the first 24 weeks of antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C. METHODS: 78 patients (57 men, 21 women, mean age: 52+12 years, HCV genotype 1: 47.5%) with significant fibrosis defined by a liver stiffness measurement > 7 kPa were included. 68 patients were treated with the combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin at the standard doses, whereas 10 untreated patients served as the control group. Liver stiffness and the HCV RNA level were determined at day 0 and at weeks 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 of therapy. The rapid virologic response (n=40) was defined by a viral load < 615 IU/mL at week 4. The slow virologic response (n=17) was defined by a viral load > 615 IU/mL at week 4 but < 615 IU/mL at week 24. The nonresponse (n=11) was defined by an HCV RNA > 615 IU/mL at week 24. RESULTS: Liver stiffness at baseline did not differ between the treated and non treated patients. Liver stiffness at baseline was higher in the nonresponders than in the slow and rapid responders, but the difference did not reach significance due to the small number of nonresponders. Liver stiffness did not change significantly in the control group, in the non responders and in the slow responders. In contrast, it decreased significantly in the rapid responders (13.9 to 12.3, p=0.028). CONCLUSION: the rapid virologic response to pegylated IFN and ribavirin therapy is associated with a rapid improvement in liver stiffness as measured by the Fibroscan in patients with chronic hepatitis C.",

We report the results of a planned interim safety and data analysis. A total of 250 subjects received study drug.Methods: Subjects were randomized into 4 groups; 3 groups were randomized to receive TVR 750 mg q8h, Peg-IFN-2a 180 ug/week, and RBV 1000-1200 mg/day for 12 weeks followed by 0, 12 or 36 weeks of Peg-IFN-2a and RBV (TVR/PR groups). The control group was randomized to receive up to 48 weeks of Peg-IFN-2a/RBV, with TVR-matched placebo for the first 12 weeks. This planned interim analysis was performed when the first 80 enrolled subjects had completed 12 weeks of dosing. All subjects in the TVR groups received the same treatment through Week 12; these groups were pooled for this analysis.Results: The total incidence of adverse events was similar in the control and TVR/PR groups (75% vs. 80%). Discontinuations due to adverse events were more frequent in the TVR/PR group (9% vs. 3%). Rashes were more common and some were more severe, and gastrointestinal (GI) events were more common, in the TVR/PR group. In subjects for whom results were available at Week 12, the proportion of subjects with undetectable HCV RNA at Week 12 was 88% in the TVR/PR group, and 52% in the control group (p=0.0001).
