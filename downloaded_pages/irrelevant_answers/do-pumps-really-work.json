I cant get a hard enough erection to penetrate.\u00a0\u00a0I've tried vaigra & cialis, but they didn't do a whole lot for me. I was just wondering if any thought a pump would help. My gf is great about every thing & I came make her orgasm without intercouse but its frustrating & she feels bad for me.Thanks",
