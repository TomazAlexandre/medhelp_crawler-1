            "answer": "Dear Linda,Hair loss, or alopecia, in your mother's case could either be due to aging-related changes, or possibly has occurred as a side effect of medications.\u00a0\u00a0I've done a search of the reported adverse events associated with the medications you've listed and have found the following information:\u00a0\u00a0less than one percent of patients treated with cozaar (losartan) experienced hair loss.\u00a0\u00a0It is difficult to be certain whether this hair loss would have occurred in the absence of the medication (naturally occuring), or whether it was truly associated with the medication.Two options she could consider would include seeing a dermatologist to examine the pattern of hair loss and determine what mechanism (age-related changes, or medications) is most likely.\u00a0\u00a0Secondly,\u00a0\u00a0she could discuss with her doctor stopping the cozaar (by substituting this with another class of blood pressure medications) and watching whether this change in the medicines is helpful.Information in the Heart Forum is for general purposes only.\u00a0\u00a0Specific diagnoses and therapies can only be provided by your physician.",
