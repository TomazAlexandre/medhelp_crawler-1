            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Apart from the ANA titer all other tests are normal. Generally a high ANA titre indicates an autoimmune disease (SLE, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, scleroderma, polymyositis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, dermatomyositis). Other conditions with high ANA titre include primary biliary cirrhosis, Addison disease, Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Mixed connective tissue disorders also cause a high ANA.What is important is the pattern of ANA staining: homogenous, speckled, or nucleolar. Rheumatoid arthritis is more or less ruled out. Depending on the pattern of ANA staining, other antibody tests will have to be done. The pattern of staining itself is quite diagnostic (for eg in SLE a homogenous pattern is seen, nucleolar pattern in scleroderma and speckled pattern in ITP and mixed connective tissue disorder and in lupus). Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!",
