            "answer": "Hi, you sound like a brave girl and I like your attitude. I have to tell you I was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes when I was 17 months old. Right know I just turned 46. Now days medicine has advanced and improved so much that if you are diabetic you can get a good control with a pump and live a normal life. It's not going to get in your way unless is out of control. All your symptoms our diabetic like. You really need to go to the doctor and get a real diagnosis asap. Just tell your mom what you are feeling and ask her to please take you to the doctor. Also, you could tell the school nurse to see what she recommends. Do not try to deal with this all by yourself. It's hard and you are not going to do well in school. You need some support so this doesn't affect your studies and skating etc. Good luck and God bless.",

            "answer": "Hello Kristina!Have a good talk to you mom, tell her everything that you just wrote and ask her to take you to see a doctor ASAP! If your family don't have a primary physician and if you have an insurance company that allows, tell your mom to set an appt with a Endocrinologist which is a doctor that is especialized in both types of Diabetes 1 and 2. An Endocrinologist knows EXACTLY what kind of especific antibodies tests that will allow her to make a decision. Based on your description it sounds that you have DM type 1 but there are certain antibodies that will be very active in your body that will give credibitily to her final diagnosis. For example, I am an unusual case of being completely normal person, with normal blood sugar my entire life. In a period of 6 weeks\u00a0\u00a0(and I am not kidding!) I went from having a normal blood sugar to a blood sugar over 800... I am VERY thing person. After leaving to the hospital, I was sent do see an Endocrinologist who ordered several types of blood work including very especific Antibodies and they all came back positive. The funny thing is I AM NOT A TEENAGER OR CHILD this happened a little over 1 years ago, when\u00a0\u00a0I was 39 years old (now I am 40).So, my advice for you, team up with your mom and get an appt with a doctor ASAP!!Please, tell your mom everything, including how disruptive this is to your life (school and figure skating). No one loves and cares about you more than your parents... she will understand...One more thing, my first primary doctor MISSED completely the signs of the Diabetes! So, don't think that you are going nuts or that this is only in your mind...Last thing: TELL YOUR MOM TO ASK COPIES OF ALL YOUR MEDICAL REPORTS, INCLUDING BLOOD WORK.... it is very important that we as caregiver of our children take charge of their health! :DGod bless you and let us know how was your visit with the doctor.Take care!",

            "answer": "There's a lot of symptoms, sometimes you feel few and next time you might feel others, is never the same. See, sometimes I feel the same symptoms for high and low like dizzy, blurry vision, extremely tired, sleepy, headache but only on the back of my head and neck. Now when is low I feel sweaty, and see purple spots everywhere kind of like when you see the flash on a camera, shaky. When is high I'm very thirsty and feel like I'm carrying something heavy. I hope this helps you!!!",

            "answer": "Hello there! i hope you will/have seen an endocrinologist (diabetes specialist) so you will be more likely to get a correct diagnosis. All of your symptoms are those of a Type 1 diabetic. Don't let this go on like this any longer so you will not experience complications with your eyes, kidneys or nervous system.I have been Type 1 for 64 years and I am very healthy. I was diagnosed in 1945 when I was 6. With good control we Type 1's can have long, healthy lives. Good luck to you!Richard",
