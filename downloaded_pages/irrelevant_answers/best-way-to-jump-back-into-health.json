    "question": "Hey, I used to dance a lot and used to be really fit. Then because I'm in school it got harder to go to classes because of the workload. Now I'm 16, working casually, still at school and doing tafe part-time. I just want to get my motivation and my fitness levels up, so I won't be exhausted all the time. I really need it because it is getting to the point where I will pass out because I don't have the energy or motivation. My p.e. teacher told me that by being active, I will have more energy but I've been inactive for so long, that I don't know how to get back. Any ideas would be much appreciated.",
