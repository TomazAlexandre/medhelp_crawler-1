            "answer": "It is great your blood-work was normal. For your height, your weight should be around 186lbs. From your description of your food intake, it seems you may have very limited intake of some nutrients. I suggest you take a daily multi-vitamin so you will get the needed vitamins and minerals. Best of luck.",

    "question": "Hey Dr. I was hoping you could help me out. I recently went and got a minor physical ( blood pressure, weight, height. etc) because I was having knee surgery. I just had the knee surgery 4 days ago, but the day of the minor physical I had a blood test done, they took 6 viles of blood, I had stds, thyroid,diabetes things like that checked. It's been 2 weeks since I had those tests done, I called for my results they said the results are in and if the doctor dosen't call your fine. now on to my question, I rarely eat any fruits or vegatables, I eat alot of potatoes, corn thats about it, the odd apple. I'm 22 year old male, 6 foor 4 , 180lbs. I always feel tired, cant pay attention, feel weak, bad memory,feel like i got something in my eye sometimes but theres nothing there. what do you think the problem is? any help would be great. THanks very much",
