Best of luck!",

            "answer": "They said that my esophagus has 3 places that have deteriated in it and I also have a Hiatus Hernia. I have been on nexium now for 6 months and they said that with the acid being as extreme as it is that everytime my body tried to create new cells the acid was destroying them. I am a little afraid to have the surgery, due the fact that in my mid 20's I went thru 3 years of surgerys to finally complete a hystorectomy and I have so much scare tissue that I'm not sure they will be able to complete the surgery with laparoscopy.",

            "answer": "I hear ya when you say you are scared to have more surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Can they possibly increase your Nexium to 2 a day (one in the morning and one at night).\u00a0\u00a0Maybe that will help to give you the relief you are looking for.\u00a0\u00a0I guess the only words of wisdom I might have is make sure your surgeon is well qualified in doing this surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I thought I was fortunate enough to have the surgeon who \"developed\" the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I was only the 75th one he did back in 1995.\u00a0\u00a0I feel certain about the practice makes perfect statement so I would ask the surgeon how many of these he has performed.\u00a0\u00a0I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck to you!",

What is the connection between my Barretts Esophagus and my liver? And a severe case what does that mean? I have already had a byospy on my esophagus and there was no cancer at the time.",
