Since lesions showed no enhancement, diffusion abnormality or susceptibility effect, they are unlikely to be tumors, cancer metastasis, aneurysms and other venous deformities.You do appear to have a small abnormality in the vein of one of the lobes, but it is present since birth and is not likely to be the cause of any problem you are being investigated for.You appear to be having inflammation of mastoid sinus (under your cheeks)\u2014probably due to sinusitis.Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.

Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
