    "question": "I am a 19\u00a0\u00a0year old man and have been having sex with my girlfriend for about a year now. Just the other day for the first time I could not get hard. I was pretty pissed off about this and got mad at myself and my girlfriend. We tried again two days later and the same result occurred. I was once again really upset with myself it made my self-esteem go down. I think it was because I kept thinking about the other day not being able to preform and get an erection. I am an active kid in college who does like to drink and smoke. I masturbate around 3 times a week. Should I take a cleanse and stop preforming all of these activities? Should I look into investing medical help? Or was it just a one time thing? Will this continue and be a problem for a while? Or is it just a mental thing that I shouldn't think or worry about?",
