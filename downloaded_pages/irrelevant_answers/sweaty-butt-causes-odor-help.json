    "question": "When I sit down in school (PLASTIC CHAIRS) my butt starts to sweat, than an odor appears.! everyone around me in class can smell it. Can the sweat be causing the odor? I shower twice every day, wash my clothes everyday so its not from left over fecal matter or dirty clothes. I also have butt hair can that be causing it? I am not over weight. this is very embarassing does anyone else have this problem? When I stand up in class everyone says it smells like a skunk. And when I feel my boxers they are wet/damp from sweat. THIS ONLY HAPPENS AT SCHOOL IN THE PLASTIC CHAIRS and the smell starts like after 5 minutes of sitting down please help.",
