In the meantime, what is your main concern; is a woman with HCV pregnant? Are you concerned that she might pass her disease on to her child?HCV is passed from mother to child roughly 5% of the time, if that helps you at all.Good luck\u2014Bill",

            "answer": "Hi\u00a0\u00a0Solosola,Welcome to the forum. I just noticed that you are a medical doctor. None of us here is a doctor, except for one member who treated for HCV but doesn't come around much and another who is a scientist (HR, who also doesn't come around much).As Bill said, there's about a five percent chance of vertical transmission but I don't know if the risk is greater through c-section or vaginal birth, although I would guess the former. I'm quite sure breastfeeding poses no problem, as HCV is strictly via blood-to-blood contact.Anyone with HCV should be immunized for HBV and HAV, if no antibodies for these are present.Studies are limited in pediatric hepatology. You can have a look at this thread, which concerns a new member discussing the tx of her eight-year old son:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Hepatitis-C/8-year-old-Partial-Responder/show/1308678I took a\u00a0\u00a0peek at your interests that you listed in your profile and was somewhat blown away.

            "answer": "Here is a brief summary of the progression of stages, I think I posted it in a thread say a few days ago.\u00a0\u00a0This is as far as I've gotten in my research.\u00a0\u00a0Thought I would copy/paste it in here real quick.\u00a0\u00a0It's better to be educated about this than not.\u00a0\u00a0I don't want too little too late to be the case here.From the time you are infected six months after that is called the acute phase. The immune system may clear the virus during this time, if that doesn't happen six months after the time you are infected is called the chronic phase or stage. Generally hepatitis c is classified as a liver disease, however the virus can affect other body systems and cause symptoms, illnesses, and other complications outside of the liver.Changes can occur with your liver if the virus is present. The progression is generally slow moving, but can intially start as inflammation due to virus hijacking, infecting, or killing off liver cells through gradual scarring (fibrosis) and then hardening of the liver tissue (cirrhosis). During progression the immune system plays a highly influential role both in stemming the disease, but in accelerating the scarring of the liver.Cirrhosis is associated with severe scarring that alters the main structure of the liver. Over-time this can seriously undermine the livers ability to function. In terms of classification cirrhosis is defined as compensated or de-compensated. If your liver is still functioing properly such as carrrying out essential functions then it is compensated cirrhosis. If the livers functions are affected it is called decompensated cirrhosis.The most series stage is portal hypertension: This is when blood cannot properly flow into the liver and causes bleeding from distended veins (varicies) in the oepsphagus and the build up of abdominal fluid (acites)Hepatic Encephalopathy: If blood is forced to bypass the liver it is not filtered for poisons and toxins and there is a risk of serious mental confusion leading to coma. Cirrhosis also significantly increases the risk of developing liver cancer. This can develop from either compensated or decompensated cirrhosis. The time it takes varies. For some it may be quicker, but for others it may take up to sixty years. Cory.",
