            "answer": "Hi!A weight loss surgery is recommended only if medical management of excess weight is not possible or the patient is not responding to it. Also, just weight is not a parameter\u2014person\u2019s height, waist, body surface area, BMI etc are all considered.First the doctor will assess him, take detailed medical history, rule out causes of weight gain with appropriate tests (diabetes, hypothyroidism, adrenal gland problem, anemia, liver and kidney problems), assess his diet, physical activity level etc. Then he will be recommended to follow a particular diet and exercise schedule. Also, if any medical condition causing weight gain is found, then this will be treated. He may be put on medications to kick start the weight loss. If he still does not respond, then yes, he will be taken up for surgery.The type of surgery will be decided after complete assessment of the case and in consultation with your uncle and the medical team. However, weight loss surgeries have their own complications like any other surgery. It is recommended if all other methods fail and patient\u2019s weight is likely to cause great harm. Please ask him to consult his doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "Yes. Your uncle seems to be an eligible candidate for a weight loss surgery. Basically, what this surgery does is reduce the stomach's capacity to eat more food which thus leads to weight loss. This could be done either by putting a lap band on the stomach which decreases the size of the stomach or by means of a balloon in the stomach which occupies the space in the stomach. I would suggest, go for it but yes make sure you pick a good hospital like Nova Specialty Hospitals. All the best !",

            "answer": "The Proffesor who will operate Bariatric Surgery procedures is TOP CLASS.Prof. Dr. Sad\u0131k Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m (Graduate of JOHN HOPKINS HOSPITAL\u00a0\u00a0, America)The body mass index (BMI), or Quetelet index, is a measure for human body shape based on an individual's mass and height..BMI\u00a0\u00a0(Body Mass Index) =\u00a0\u00a0>30 kg/m 2 is the most important Endication of this procedure.For Example : Patient weight is 90kg and height is 1.70m90/(1.70*1.70) = 90 / (2.89) = 31.14 kg/m 2 \uf0e0 Endication for OperationThere may be 3 different kind of procedures they are :1-Sleeve Gastrectomy :Sleeve gastrectomy is a surgical weight-loss procedure in which the stomach is reduced to about 25% of its original size, by surgical removal of a large portion of the stomach along the greater curvature. The result is a sleeve or tube like structure. The procedure permanently reduces the size of the stomach, although there could be some dilatation of the stomach later on in life. The procedure is generally performed laparoscopically and is irreversible.With the John Hopkins Hospital\u00a0\u00a0Surgical Methods , with Prof. Dr. Sad\u0131k Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, Procedure success is %95. Complication percent is only %1-2 with this method.The Procedure\u00a0\u00a0takes place in 1 to 2 hours.Procedure is included with :\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1)Before operation there will be a Meeting with Prof.Dr.Sad\u0131k Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and general physical examination of the patient will be done.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2)Before operation Blood Tests will be done and the test results will be Evaluated by the Proffesor.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3)Patient will be prepared for operation and operation will be performed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4)After operation patient will be looked after sincerely, specially in ICU (Intensive Care Unit) for 2 days.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5)After 2 days of sincere care in the ICU, patient will be transferred to Inpatient Service for 4 days. Within these days, there will be Dr. Visits everyday for control following-up the patient.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6)There will be Special Care for the Patient in the Hospital, all the time for the sake of John Hopkins Hospital Ethique.IMPORTANT NOTE : Those listed above are not subject to an extra charge. Theyare all included to Operation.(After operation Patient may be discharged from the hospital within 2 to 3 days but Dr. Advices the patient to stay at least 1 week for close control follow-up)2-Metabolic Operation is the 2nd type of Operation called Gastric By-pass :Gastric bypass procedures (GBP) are any of a group of similar operations that first divides the stomach into a small upper pouch and a much larger lower \"remaining\" pouch and then re-arranges the small intestine to connect to both. Surgeons have developed several different ways to reconnect the intestine, thus leading to several different GBP names. Any GBP leads to a marked reduction in the functional volume of the stomach, accompanied by an altered physiological and physical response to food.The operation is prescribed to treat\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1)Morbid obesity (defined as a body mass index BMI =\u00a0\u00a0>40kg/m 2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2)Type 2 diabetes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3)Hypertension\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4)Sleep Apnea\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5)other comorbid conditions.Bariatric surgery is the term encompassing all of the surgical treatments for morbid obesity, not just gastric bypasses, which make up only one class of such operations. The resulting weight loss, typically dramatic, markedly reduces comorbidities. The long-term mortality rate of gastric bypass patients has been shown to be reduced by up to 40%. As with all surgery, complications may occur with Dr.Sad\u0131k Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m\u2019s Technique , complication percentage is %1-2.Gastric By-pass is an operation with a success rate of %90 for the treatment of Diabetes and Hypertension with Dr.Sad\u0131k Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m technique this percentage goes upto %95 which is good news.Operation is icluded all the same things that mentioned above . The only change is\u00a0\u00a0after operation patient will be looked after sincerely for 2 days in ICU and for 5 days in the inpatient service.3-Sleeve Gastrectomy + Gastric By-pass : This is the 3rd kind of operation.Sleeve Gastrectomy + Gastric By-pass sugeries are done together in one session in this kind of operations. Success rates and Hospitalization times are as the same as the 2nd kind of operation.The most commonly preferred operation is Sleeve Gastrectomy. Lower likelihood of complications in this procedure.",

            "answer": "Hello,\u00a0\u00a0this procedure reduces the size of the stomach to create a pouch that accepts no more than an ounce or so of food at a time. Gastric bypass surgery literally bypasses the bulk of the stomach and encourages massive weight loss in obese individuals.Your uncle can have gastric bypass for sure, or any other weight loss surgery. Generally, any individual the age between 15 and 50 years is a good candidate for gastric bypass surgery if they are relatively healthy. The procedure is typically reserved for those who are more than 75 pounds overweight and have a body mass index of 40 to 50 or 35 to 39 with a life threatening co morbidity factor.I know someone who had gastric bypass abroad, as the insurance didn't cover the surgery, so she contacted a medical tourism company that helped her understand, compare and choose a good treatment for her needs. As I know, the surgery was a success and she's losing weight fast (she had the surgery 3 weeks ago).Now if you want I can give you her e-mail or anything you need in order to contact her for more details. Wish your uncle best luck! Anytime you want, you can contact me..",
