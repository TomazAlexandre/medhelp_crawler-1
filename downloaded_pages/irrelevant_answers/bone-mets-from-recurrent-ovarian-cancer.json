            "answer": "Hello...if the cancer has metastisizedd to the bone I cannot imagine it would be localized enough to be able to have it surgically removed.\u00a0\u00a0I know she must be really disappointed.....all she can do now is fight this monster again.....it is said by some here that this disease is chronic and will need to be dealt with sort of like diabetes.....not a pleasant thought but quite factual.\u00a0\u00a0Her depression is quite understandable.....maybe an anti-depressant should be considered.\u00a0\u00a0Every one of us is different when it comes to prognosis.....nobody knows how long anyone has...and, anyone who says they do know should be clobbered.\u00a0\u00a0Your friend will want to talk at some point in time and it is good you are there for her and are not a member of her family.\u00a0\u00a0She is lucky to have you to go through this with her.\u00a0\u00a0It was hard for me to unload on my family as it was so hard for them to stand back and watch what was happening to me.\u00a0\u00a0I wish only the best for you and her.....come back and talk anytime.....maybe your friend would like to visit with us as well.\u00a0\u00a0TAke care and give your friend our best.Peace.dian",
