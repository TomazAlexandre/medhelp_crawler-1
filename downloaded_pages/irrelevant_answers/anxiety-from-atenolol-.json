    "question": "I took 1 single 25mg tablet of Atenolol last Wednesday and didn't like the way I felt so I immediately stopped taking it. So I only took one pill. Two days after taking it I started having anxiety and my heart was racing. I do have a history of anxiety so I am not sure if this is just a coincidence. Though I have not had anxiety for like 10 years. My wife and son are in Florida for eight days and I'm really stressed about it so that could be causing it also. But I wonder if the one Atenolol could cause some anxiety in my body. did something inside my brain? Do you think it is causing this? A part of me deep down believes this is just my own stress and anxiety from my wife and son being so far away.",
