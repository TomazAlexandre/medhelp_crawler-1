            "answer": "The dangers of this kind of surgery are the same as for any surgery for a type 1 diabetic: infection is more of a risk for diabetics than for other people. If her glucose levels are under good control, she has a better chance of healing without any problems. But if glucose levels are kept high, infection is a danger.So we can't say if she will get sick. It really depends on how well her glucose levels are managed and how healthy she is at the time of surgery.",

            "answer": "Subjecting a child, or any person to such mutilation and abuse is inconcievable, diabetic or not. This child should be removed from your ignorant care and given to someone who respects human life and rights. If you are in the U.S., I hope you are arrested and jailed for even considering this. She will die, not due to infections, but due to your lack of any ability to care for or about another human being, culture be damned.",
