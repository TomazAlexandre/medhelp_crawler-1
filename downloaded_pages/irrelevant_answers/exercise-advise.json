    "question": "I am 95 pounds overweight (over the medically indicated ideal body weight).\u00a0\u00a0 I am 30 year/male.\u00a0\u00a0 I experience heart palpitations (extra beats) from time to time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have a normal echo and EKG with mild mitral regurgitation.Starting to exercise again...I can theoretically blast away on my exercise bike for an hour with a heart rate of 170+,\u00a0\u00a0I have the energy to do it,\u00a0\u00a0but I'm sure I may faint or have many palpitations afterward.\u00a0\u00a0 So, right now I'm doing it like this, about 4 days a week...Minutes 1-7 warmup,\u00a0\u00a0working my way up to a HR of 145Minutes 8-24,\u00a0\u00a0maintaining HR about 151-159Minutes 25-33, slow easy cool down, then to stop peddling only once my HR slows into the 115-120 range (have found that helps avoids post exercise palpitations).Am I \"in the zone\" long enough to be effective?\u00a0\u00a0 Should I go up to 45 mins a day total?\u00a0\u00a0I tried 45 mins before and it felt like I was too tired, over training maybe?\u00a0\u00a0 Is my heart rate good for my age and weight?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rest of the time, I am very inactive.\u00a0\u00a0Is that a problem?\u00a0\u00a0Should I exercise twice a day, or at least run up and down some stairs 10 times a day extra?\u00a0\u00a0Would that make a big difference?My goals are to recondition,\u00a0\u00a0get rid of the palpitations, lose fat, avoid diabetes, etc.Would the mild mitral regurgitation be the cause of my palpitations?\u00a0\u00a0Will it improve w/ exercise?Separate question...Also, I know it has been associated w/ anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0 Could this be the source of my panic attack symptoms, even if it's just mild?",
