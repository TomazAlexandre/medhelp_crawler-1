            "answer": "I wish I knew how they decide that. My Dad was diagnosed as being in end stage heart failure back in '06. They even put him on hospice care. The hospice nurse came once a week to monitor his medications, change them as needed. Funny thing? His heart stabilized and after 6 months they took him off of hospice care. He did finally pass away in Aug. '08 but it was from lung cancer that had spread throughout his body.It would be good to know how they decide end stage because my Dad fooled them all.",

            "answer": "Maybe this will help you understand. There is the New York Classification which runs from a Grade I to a Grade IV. A Grade I heart patient has no real symptoms of heart disease. A Grade II patient has some symptoms, Grade III has symptoms with activity and a Grade IV (end stage) has symptoms at rest",

            "answer": "Clinically end stage heart failure happens when the heart contractions are weak and blood from the lungs back up into the lungs and fluids leak in the lung tissues causing pulmonary edema. I had mild edema (congested heart failure) and my heart was strong enough, with treatment, to recover. End stage would be a heart so weak as to\u00a0\u00a0cause breathing problems with very little exertion and possibly no exertion, dry coughing, possible chest pains, easily fatigued, bedridden, and very susceptible to cardiac arrest and that would be the finality.An EF below 30% is considered heart failure range, but with treatment to reduce the heart's workload, etc., 30% or less may be sufficient to live with reduced activities, but untreated a decline can be rapid causing heart muscle damage and further reduction of the heart's contractility.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your reply.\u00a0\u00a0I don't see how they can call me end stage then since all the fluid that collected in my lungs and tissues has been extracted with diuretics etc.\u00a0\u00a0I do have minimal breathing problems but I was a smoker for over 30 years, quit a month ago and have COPD and asthma but my breathing problems have greatly decreased since I quit smoking and since the fluid is mostly all gone.\u00a0\u00a0I still have to take diuretics every day but I thought everyone that got the congested heart failure did.\u00a0\u00a0Do they ever take the \"pee pills\" away?\u00a0\u00a0Wow, sorry, couldn't resist that.\u00a0\u00a0I am still getting around pretty good, get tired easier but that happened last time I was in heart failure.\u00a0\u00a0I am hoping to pull myself back out of this with the supplements and those nasty beta blockers.\u00a0\u00a0Being on a sodium and fluid restricted diet is hardest of all for me since I love salt and drink a lot.\u00a0\u00a0It probably wouldn't be so hard except I already control my diabetes with a restricted diet and it is hard to find things I can eat that don't effect my heart or my diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Wow, it is a\u00a0\u00a0lot of work just keeping my diet straight.\u00a0\u00a0Again, thanks for your reply, it makes me feel more positive about my outcome.\u00a0\u00a0They were trying to push me to have a heart transplant, defibrillator and/or valve surgery but I am not having dangerous arrhythmias yet and I feel well enough that I don't want to rush anything with a transplant.\u00a0\u00a0I feel I am giving myself only another 10 years (at most) with that and I am only 44 years old.\u00a0\u00a0Any other information you might have would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Take care and I hope you get to feeling better also.",
