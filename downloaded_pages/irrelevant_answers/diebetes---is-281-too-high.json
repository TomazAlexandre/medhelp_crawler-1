A lot can be learned by reading other forum posts/comments. Also go here for a wealth of information on diabetes http://alturl.com/c2gky\"I had breakfast, Honey Oats, at 10:00am and tested my blood sugar at noon, with a result of 281, which I have not seen before.\"You ate a bowlful of sugar. Honey oats on average contains 6 grams of sugar per 3/4 cup. Add 12-14 grams of sugar with an 8oz glass of milk. What this equates to is 3 heaping Tablespoons of refined sugar.Care to share what levels you have seen before? Also, test postprandial 2 1/2 and 3 hours after a meal to see if your levels drop considerably from the 2 hr test period.",

            "answer": "Poster Satu234 consumed close to 21 grams of sugar, not 6. And, 37 grams of carbs is not high and not all carbs ride around on RB cells as excess glucose. The liver and muscle cells take carb sugar and converts it into glycogen. Glycogen is released for energy when needed.Furthermore, a danger of too low carb diet can cause the body to go into a dangerous metabolic state called ketosis since your body burns fat instead of glucose for energy. During ketosis, the body forms substances known as ketones, which can cause organs to fail and result in gout, kidney stones, or kidney failure.Yes, carb intake should be limited to a minimum but at the same time complex carbs should not be restricted from ones diet. Eat foods high in fiber, whole grains, low fructose fruits, fish and lean poultry and more vegetables.",

Ketoacidosis is an increase in fat metabolism because of a shortage of insulin, mostly associated with t1's. Ketosis is an elevated level of ketones. High levels of ketones, which left untreated, CAN lead to ketoacidosis.Do not misinterpret the dangers of a low carb diet. For t2's a low carb diet is highly recommended, but the danger lies with a too low carb diet, or a low carb and high protein diet, which can lead to ketosis. To say ketosis is not dangerous is dangerous to forum readers.",

            "answer": "You need to learn to read nutritional information that is provided on the labels of the foods you eat. What matters most is how many grams of carbohydrates are in a portion. And you need to learn what a portion is so that it correlates! Most people in this country consume way too much food and think a bowl full of cereal is normal. It is not! Read the label and most cereals will tell you that a serving consists of 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup. Now, you read the label and see how many carbs are contained in that portion. Plus, remember that you are adding a 1/2 c. or more of milk to that cereal and you need to add in the carb count for the milk. If you add fruit, once again you need to figure out the carbs and remember that a portion would be 1/2 of a banana or 1/4 c. of berries. The way most people eat their cereal, they are easily consuming over 100 gms. of carbs in one bowl!!!! The most you should have per meal is 45-60 gms. The low end is for women and the high end number is for men. My doctor insists that her patients eat no more than 30-45 gms. per meal; very tight control of carbs leads to success.",

            "answer": "I'd like to clarify here.Keytones occur in the body when fat is burned for energy. This is called ketosis.\u00a0\u00a0They happen overnight in most people (due to the extended fast) in small amounts.\u00a0\u00a0They also occur during weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0They also are seen in people eating a low carb diet where fat rather than carbohydrates are being used for energy.\u00a0\u00a0They are not dangerous in the presence of normal blood sugar levels.Ketoacidosis is a very dangerous condition that can happen in persons with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0This is the presence of high levels of keytones simultaneous with high blood sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0It reflects that the body is burning its own fat (regardless of how many carbs are eaten) because insulin is not able to work.\u00a0\u00a0This can be life threatening.A low carb diet can be very effective in controlling blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0The more extreme carb restriction is recommended by Dr. Richard Bernstein (Diabetes Solutions) of 35 g of carbs per day.\u00a0\u00a0He has proven that this can be safe long-term, and many persons with diabetes have also foundthis to be true.\u00a0\u00a0Such a low carb diet as this can cause ketosis (presence of keytones), which is the natural byproduct.Moral again is that it is very important to keep blood sugars well controlled. whether this be low or medium or high carb diet, and with exercise and meds and other lifestyle measures.",
