            "answer": "edemunster you are not alone. i am also 36 years old. and last week i was diagnosed with type 2. from the time i was 20 until i turned 27 i lifted weights all the time, played sports etc. a week after my 27th birthday, i began to ache all the time, and all over my body. after 6 months of different physicians, i found a doc who diagnosed me with \"fibromyalgia and /or chronic fatigue\". like yourself there are days when i am rock bottom in the energy department. i just want to sleep. and like you my job demands me to be active as i am the president of a large Landscape firm. before last week i just thought the tired ness was the same old chronic fatigue but i was peeing all day and staying thirsty and i had lost around 8 lbs. i wnet to my mother in law who is a diabetic just to check my blood sugar and it was high (really high) and a follow up with a doctor confirmed what i already knew.\u00a0\u00a0at first i was just way angry that on top of the fatigue, now i had to accept diabetes as well. and i was like \"whats the use\" because it seemed like the harder i was trying,the more **** was stacking against me. well i have changed my diet, began on taking as pill and just going to take it one day at a time. all i can offer is to keep your head up, try to eat right, exercise when you can, and take your medications. i hope you get to feeling better because i do know what it feels like. good luck",

            "answer": "Thanks for your input. Yeah my diagnosis is barely 2 months old and like you I was not pleased to say the least. I looked at it as a death setence, you know the stories, your feet fall off, you loose your kidneys and you die attached to a dialisis machine. Its been difficult at best. But I am just so tired, Im starting to wonder if its depression. Cause like I said I am in a very active job and its starting to affect that and my family life. Do you have issues with mood as well ? Cause I'm as off as a 8 month pregnant woman. Who knows.",

            "answer": "Both of u need to know Diabetes is not a death sentence. U make it what it is, get control and u will get it under tight control. Let it go and yes all the complication will be down the road waiting. But Simji u sound like a strong person and taking it by its horns will make a big difference. And ede, ede, sweetie get better. But go to your dr. and tell him or her u might be suffering from depression, Cymbalta can help that and aches and pains. I think u took this diagnoses to deep, and a little help is what you need. Both of need to know and remember, there are millions of us diabetics, and I have u both beat, I have had type 2 since I was 16 way back in 1972 and I was 89lbs, a virus killed some of my betta cells.....and diet is everything with changing you to a stable diabetic.

            "answer": "Have you had your thyroid checked for underactive or overactive thyroid?\u00a0\u00a0See an endocronologist and have your thyroid tested.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to the TSH test, a more complete thyroid panel should also include free T3, free T4, and possibly TPO antibodies, and reverse T3.\u00a0\u00a0This often goes undiagnosed in people.I'm newly diagnosed with Type II diabetes and have been experimenting with dealing with it WITHOUT DRUGS by diet, exercise, green tea, cinnamon and herbal supplements made from Amazon Rainforest botanicals.-particularly Metabazon. (bountifulhealing.amazonherb.net)\u00a0\u00a0It's working beautifully so far.Don't get angry or depressed about it, friend - TAKE CONTROL. I have been enjoying researching the web on Type II Diabetes, and exploring information about foods and herbs and alternative \"treatments\" that seek to help the body heal itself of this challenge rather than drugs which just treat the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I have a directory in my computer where I keep pertinent information I come across. I learn more every day and feel confident about making decisions and experimenting with alternative ways of helping the body heal itself of this imbalance. Of course, fatigue can really wear you down and out and make it difficult to do anything.Don't just assume that fatigue comes from the diabetes - particularly since you say your blood sugars have been standard and \"nothing out of the ordinary\".\u00a0\u00a0Be open to finding other causes.Also - the pharmaceutical companies with all their advertising (3 out of 4 commercials are for a drug to control symptoms of a \"sickness\") have us brainwashed.\u00a0\u00a0My diagnosis was made during a hospital stay and I left thinking all those \"serious consequences\" were imminent and inevitable\u00a0\u00a0and of course with a precription in hand for a drug WHICH I WAS DETERMINED NOT TO TAKE!.I'm enjoying the challenge of \"being good to my body\" and finding out how to help it meet this challenge, correct this imbalance, and heal itself.Shanti",

    "question": "Hello,I am a somewhat new T2, and Im on the normal starter med routine for this type of dibetes, metoformin(glucophage) glyboride, excuse the spellings Im by no means a pharmasist. But I feel like I am 90 years old. I am 36. I work in the Information Technology field, high energy, sharp mind type of job. But I can sleep 20 hours a day and it sin't enough. I ache, I feel like hell, I'm tired all the time, my appetite is nill. My blood sugars have been standard. Nothing out of the ordinary when I do eat and such. I do eat daily so my lack of energy isnt for lack of nutrition. I just feel like I got hit by a truck. And nothing helps. I have an appointment with mu internest, but I was wondering is this normal with T2 diabetes cause it's starting to affect my job and my family life. Even as i type this I want to go home and goto bed. I've read about something called cronfic fatigue syndrome, is this linked to dibetes ? I can't continue like this, I don't have good days.
