            "answer": "Sweaty smells often evolve from things you eat, drink ect. When your body sweats it rids itself of toxins, it is a way of cleaning out your system. See if you are eating anything that could be causing it. Even I, who usually doesn't have any strange bodily odors sometimes due if I am consuming certain foods and exercise I will smell completely different! I hate it. You may want to try a Detox Kit and it may help you get rid of some of the toxins in your body.",

            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!The bad odor is due to sweat coming in contact with the bacteria on the skin. Diabetes is also a reason for odor in sweat. Coffee, aerated drinks, spicy and oily food all make us sweat more. Try to reduce these in your diet. Drink plenty of water, fresh fruit juices, and eat plenty of fruits and vegetables in the diet. Reduce intake of proteins. After a bath dry yourself well and use antiperspirants. Wear loose clothes made of natural fibers, preferably cotton. Get your blood sugar tested both fasting and two hours after food.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
