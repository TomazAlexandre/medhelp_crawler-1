            "answer": "It will be okay.\u00a0\u00a0The test really ***** but at least after it's over you have your information.\u00a0\u00a0Many women fail the 1 hr test and are just fine.\u00a0\u00a0Don't worry too much yet.\u00a0\u00a0Just because you didn't get a great result on the first test doesn't mean you have a problem, it just means you should be tested further thus the 3 hr test.\u00a0\u00a0Even if you do end up having gestational diabetes, it is manageable and something that you can take care of.\u00a0\u00a0Keep your head up you and your little guy will be just fine :)",

            "answer": "I failed my 1 hour too... so I just did my 3 hour this past Tuesday.It SUCKED.I threw a FIT because I hadda stay in there!Ontop of it I had MADD heartburn and I was STARVING!!!!!!I was all like, \"WTF is the point of me being here for 3 hours! I'm sicka being stuck with needles all the f*ckin time I look like a f*ckin heroin addict!\"Then when they told me after the first hour that I couldn't leave the waiting room I told the b*tch to her face that I was going outside for a cigarette and then I was gunna sit in the other lobby upstairs because atleast those ones are comfortable and there's AC.lolAnd then she tried to say that she wouldn't finish the test if I left and I told her f*ck you, I'll be back 15 minutes before my next blood drawing, and that she hadda do it because it's her job and she's being paid for it.Then I told her to get over it and I'd be back in 45 minutes.lolNeedless to say she didn't give me anymore problems and I did as I pleased and it wasn't so bad.But THEN-Her n the other nurses kept having problems finding my vains.She'd stick the needle in, and no blood would come out, so she's stick it in and poke it in somewhere else.I was getting so P*ISSED!Then one of them turns around to talk to someone with the needle RIGHT ON my arm, and she scratches me with it like 3 er 4 times!!!I wanted to KILL HER!!!!I told her she better do the lab properly because I WASN'T coming back for another god d*mn screening.She's lucky I don't go n get her a$$ fired and/or sue her for scratchin me like that.GRRR.lol",
