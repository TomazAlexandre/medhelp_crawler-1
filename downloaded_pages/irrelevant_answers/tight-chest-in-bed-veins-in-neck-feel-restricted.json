            "answer": "Hi Keith,Sorry to hear you aren't feeling well.It is unlikely that the leg/foot pain is related to the lightheadedness when you stood up.\u00a0\u00a0Chest tightness at rest in bed is not a typical symptom of chest pain related to heart artery blockages, but probably merits a face to face evaluation by a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0If you haven't seen a doctor in recent years, it is probably time for a check up.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like your family has some relatively significant health problems and you would benefit from screening to evaluate for these conditions.That is about all I can offer, but again would encourage you to see your doctor.Hope you feel better soon.",
