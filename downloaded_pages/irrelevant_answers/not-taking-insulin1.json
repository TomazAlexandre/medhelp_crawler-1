            "answer": "DONT GIVE UP, your life is more important then your weight..I took shots for yrs then switched to the pump. If you continue to let your sugars stay high just to loose weight you will end up with worse problems such as blindness, kidney failure etc..YOU MUST take your Insulin..If you dont like your stomach do what I did and give the injection in your arm, thats what I did after my tummy got fat build up also..Not sure what 9dtone is but\u00a0\u00a0I am a size 6 and weigh 140 so try and stay healthy and not worry about wt, caz you will end up in the hospital if you keep your sugar daily over 200 then major health problems start.",

            "answer": "I also no how you feel like noone listens. I also drink Alcohol at first it raises my blood sugars then a few hrs later I crash. I was honest with my Endo and she said just make sure I eat food with the Alcohol so I have to go to bed with at least a 250 blood sugar caz then i wake up less then 100 or too low if I don't eat..I get tired every year STILL my parents say on Thanksgiving can you eat stuffing, potatoes, turkey? OMG I yell at them and say I can eat anything fricken thing I want just need to take more Insulin for the carbs in the stuffing etc.. I no it gets old.. People don't understand us at all. When I was working as a nurse my patients said How did you Get type 1 diabetes at the age of 38? You must of ate too much sugar? I would say please people, that is NOT what caused my Diabetes and besides before I got this disease I was not a huge sugar eater anyways, I always craved salt like chips, pizza, fries, etc.. I still eat that but in small amounts and not on a daily basis..I'm sorry your feeling sick and hope you feel better soon. Where do you live? What kind of Insulin are you on? I am on Novolog. If you are ever on Facebook look me up as a friend..bettyannmatthews..\u00a0\u00a0What is your name sweets??? I am out of work now 1 yr since my triple back surgery and brittle Diabetes so I am on line allot...It keeps me busy and I like to help others~~~I am here anytime you need a shoulder to lean on without any judgement from me..It will get better I promise, I was in denial for yrs and never took this disease serious till I was in the Hospital a few times and almost in a coma so now I want to live esp after seeing the Bret Michaels concert last month here in my town. He is a musician with type 1 Diabetes and suffered a brain hemoorrhage, stroke and now a hole in his heart. I got this pic taken with him and HE IS AWESOME AND DOWN TO EARTH, I figured if he can live through all this and enjoy life it's time I stop feeling sorry for myself and try to move forward with my life and enjoy the time we have for we may not see tomorrow!!",

That is your mom's way of controlling because she can NOT fix your Diabetes so they try and Control us, believe me my mom is STILL doing it and I am 46. Gotta eat will write in a few..HANG IN THERE..YOU ARE WORTH LIVING AND LIFE IS WORTH LIVING..You will end up in the hospital if you stop your Insulin and not loose that much weight , I have tried it also and got really really sick so It was not worth it..What counts is Who YOU R on the inside, not the outside..Write you more soon!HANG IN THERE..Yes I live in the United States..:)Bettyann",

            "answer": "Hello again!I hope you are feeling a bit better. I am very sorry you are feeling so sad and frustrated. Honey I have been there many times. Just a thought for you, DON\"T stop your Insulin or you will get really sick. If you are tired of taking shots then here is a idea. Insulin does sometimes cause weight gain so what I do is eat more protein only and vegtables like chicken breasts, pork chops, string cheese, green beans, brocelli, lettuce, tomatoes, etc..Protein and MOST vegs will NOT raise your blood sugar so then you will not need Insulin. But you do need Insulin if you eat allot of carbs. So if you go on a high protein low carb way of eating and still take some Insulin you will loose weight naturally and in a healthy way..You will also feel better when your blood sugars are not all over the board. When I eat pizza I feel fine then\u00a0\u00a0hrs later the fat from the pizza makes me go over 400 so I have learned what sets my sugars off really bad.I take 1 unit of Insulin for every 15grams of carbs..So I TRY and not eat too many carbs and only eat them when my sugar is low..BUT when I am PMS before my period I tend to pig out on everything and gain 10pds and then when my period hits I loose my appetite and loose weight.It's very important we try and stay healthy. You are so young and have such a long life ahead of you sweetie. 16 is a hard age, I remember it so well, my first breakup with BF and in bed for days. My mom calling me fat and yelling at me daily then I ran away to live with my girlfriend. It is a very emotional age so that's why it is very important for you to get your feelings out to someone who will listen like me because stress is the WORST for diabetes and makes your blood sugars rise..No one ever said life is a bed of roses but it IS worth living and it is what you make of it..Try doing things that you like to make you feel better.For instance when I am depressed I go to the pet store because I love animals..It always makes me feel better that they need my love, hugs, etc...That's why I bought me a Diabetic Therapy dog my male Shihtzu 'MOJO\" you can see him on my page..He brings me so much joy.. I also got rid of friends that were always yelling at me about my Diabetes that I shouldn't be drinking shouldn't be eating this or that. I hang around people that support me only, so not too many friends now...LOL.Like I said I am here ANYTIME you want to talk. It's good to get your feelings out so you don't feel so down in the dumps..Add me as a friend and we can chat from my page or add me on facebook, just search my name bettyann matthews then add me..What is your name so i can accept you??? Let me no when you find me and we can also chat on facebook. I am praying for you and am sending (( HUGS )) your way and good vibes and energy..PLEASE HANG IN THERE AND DON'T GIVE UP..Bettyann",

Nevertheless, I just wanted to tell you that, being an 18 year-old guy diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes, it can be hard sometimes. I smoke weed occasionally with my friends, but I rarely drink. I don't drink for the most part, because my doctor told me that, aside from the usual risks of underage drinking, it can be very straining on your blood sugar levels. If I were you, then I would try to stay away from drinking. The most important thing is that you take your insulin everyday and test yourself as frequently as you can. This will help you keep your blood sugar under control. Good Luck, Liam",
