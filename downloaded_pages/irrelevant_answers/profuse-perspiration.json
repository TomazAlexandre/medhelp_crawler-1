            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Endocrine gland related conditions like hyperthyroidism, acromegaly and glucose control disorders (diabetes and hypoglycemia both) all result in increased sweating. Pheochromocytoma, cancers, carcinoid syndromes, tuberculosis and other infections too can cause increased sweating. It can also be due to low blood pressure. Get your son's thyroid and adrenal gland function tested. Let him wear loose clothes, carry an astringent and a deodorant. Let him not be over anxious about this as this will increase sweating. Easier said than done, but he has to try meditation and yoga to calm himself. Avoid too much of tea, coffee, smoking and spicy food.\u00a0\u00a0Please discuss this with your doctor and get your son investigated accordingly.Take care!",
