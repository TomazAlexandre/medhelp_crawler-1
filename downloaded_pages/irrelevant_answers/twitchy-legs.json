            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Apart from RLS it can be peripheral neuropathies like diabetes or due to pinched lumbar nerve or foot arch strain. I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked for your husband if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Take care!",

    "question": "My husband's legs will twitch when he's in his recliner with legs up and when he's in bed. He continues to twitch while he's asleep. Sometimes, he twitches and jerks so much, I have to sleep on the couch. We have even discussed getting separate beds. He says he doesn't feel the need to walk or move, so I'm thinking RLS is not the culprit. He is 56 years old, rather sedentary and spends allot of time on his feet for his job. Any ideas on what it could be and what we can do about it?",
