I've had some lightheadedness, as well, but of a different sort than you describe.Have you had your iron and electrolyte values checked lately? I'm no doctor, but those seem like good tests to have run. Ask your G.P. Also, it is important to get adequate sleep and regular exercise.Hope you feel better soon.",

    "question": "Hi,I am a 25 year old female and 1 week ago i woke up and walked around noticing I was dizzy and off balance. I wasn't spinning more like I was on a boat. Progressively over the week my neck got stiffer and stiffer- now I'm just in pain. When I walk i feel a major pressure at the base of my skull where the pain is and it's almost impossible to leave the house. I have facial pressure as well just under my eyes. I thought it may be a sinus problem as my left nostril is stuffed but nothing is coming out. My hands and feet feel tight. I get worse by the day and nothing helps. Sinus irrigation, ear drops, hot showers, sugar -- nothing. I cant deal anymore does anyone have a clue??????",
