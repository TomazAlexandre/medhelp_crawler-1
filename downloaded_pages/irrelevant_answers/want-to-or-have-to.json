But after learning I have pcos, my doctor really encouraged me to start losing weight as it would help with my problems. I'm thrilled with how I look right now. I'm down from a size 26 to 18/20 now. So I'm doing this for myself and also for my health. I want to have babies someday and being as heavy as I was be too hard for me to try. I'm hoping to start TTC sometime next year when I get under 200lbs..",
