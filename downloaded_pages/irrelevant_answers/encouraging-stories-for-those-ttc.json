    "question": "I have so many very close friends who were ttc. One was very underweight and had pco's. She went through a procedure called ovarian diathermy, she was on clomid. A day before she was going to have artifical insemination, the nurse asked her to do a pregnancy test. She thought oh it is going to be neg cause the ovulation monitor showed that she did not ovulate that month. But guess what she was pregnant, she had been trying for over 2 years. She has 2 boys now ages 3 1/2 and 1 1/2.Another\u00a0\u00a0friend from school was diagnosed with PCO's and she was overweight, she had been trying to get preg for over a year. The doc asked to get on metformin and clomid\u00a0\u00a0and guess what, she got pregnant on her own, the preg test had a faint line, her hcg levels were low and she had to get injections. She went on to have a good pregnancy, she did have gestational diabetes during her preg. She has a 11 month old boy.It is unbelieveable how many people I have met with infertility issues. MY obgyn as well went through infertility treatment and has twins. My dermatologist as well went through treatment, she must have just delivered her baby.",
