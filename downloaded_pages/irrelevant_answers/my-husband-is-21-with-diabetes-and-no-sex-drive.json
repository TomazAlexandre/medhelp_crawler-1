            "answer": "Your husband should be seen by his doctor to rule out physiological reasons for his drop in sex drive.

    "question": "I just got married last november and i love my husband to death. We have been together for almost 3 years now, and about a year ago his sex drive dropped to almost nothing. His diabetes isn't that bad and he monitors it well, and its always where it should be. However, its not only sex that dosen't happen he really doesn't want to be intamet at all. He says he loves me and is attracted to me. Also I am 5 1/2 month pregnent so yes sex does happen once in a while but not very often and when it does i have to beg for it. He is only 21 what do i do? And why would it change just like that? He says he doesn't even know why... Please help",
