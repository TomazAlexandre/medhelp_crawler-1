            "answer": "Unfortunately there is no single test (or battery of tests) that can predict who will have a heart attack. Risk factors for having heart disease include the following: age (males >45, women > 55), history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history of heart disease (first degree relative < 55 (males) or < 65 (females). The recommendations for all individuals (especially in those with multiple risk factors) is to maintain good cardiovascular fitness with diet (low fat, low sodium) and exercise (4-5 times/week of 20-30 minutes of walking, jogging, swimming, running).",

            "answer": "I'm not a Doctor, but I have family history and had a triple bypass myself at 46. I did all the usual things, diet, blood pressure, cholesterol etc but nothing seemed to slow down the progression of my disease. I then realised I was the type of person easily stressed and it is now more than coincidence that I've had 2 heart attacks after times of high emotional stressful times. I think one of the best therapies you can give your buddy is keep him in good spirit. I used to have a stressful career and life in general but thought the buzz was great. Years later I am now paying the price.",
