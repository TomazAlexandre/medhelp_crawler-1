            "answer": "Lots of things can cause tremors and shaking, including stress and diabetes and many more. My tremors are from hypothyroid and I had a friend who's hands shook for several years, turned out she had an exhaust leak in her car and she was slowly being poisoned. I suggest seeing a doc, it could be something simple but at least you'd know. Since you're in college you might be able to get free med help through school clinic, etc. if $ is an issue. Also are you eating/drinking something new? Our eating habbits can affect us greatly, we can also develope allergies and sensitivities to certain foods.Let us know how you are.",
