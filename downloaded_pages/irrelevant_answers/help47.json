            "answer": "My cousin did not get any prenatal care when she was pregnant with her first and her son ended up having holes in his heart. Had emergency surgery when he was born and almost died. He spent four months in the nicu. I started seeing my dr at seven weeks. If you go regularly they can diagnose any potential healthy problems with baby or with you (such as high blood pressure or gestational diabetes-both can be fatal to you any baby is worst case situations)",

            "answer": "I never saw a doctor during my first pregnancy and delivery. I had routine prenatal care from midwives, not doctors, though of course if complications had arisen I would surely have been referred for specialty care. The majority of pregnancies can safely be handled by midwives and don't need to be under a doctor's care - but routine prenatal care itself is incredibly important. Blood typing, diabetes screening, weight gain, abdominal measurements, iron level checks, group B strep screen, even just listening for a heartbeat - knowing things are progressing normally is incredibly important for baby's safety and mom's peace of mind.",

            "answer": "I personally waited until 18 weeks to get prenatal care, but I was having issues getting insurance and couldn't afford it otherwise unless I went to a local health clinic. I have heard horrible stories about the quality of care at that place. One girl went for an ultrasound, and they told her she was 15-16weeks. She delivered her healthy FULL TERM baby boy a week and a half later. How can they be that off??",
