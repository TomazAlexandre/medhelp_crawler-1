            "answer": "My doctor was very surprised that I had the flu so early as well.\u00a0\u00a0I live in Pittsburgh, but believe that I picked up the virus while in Indianapolis on a business trip (in the latter part of September).\u00a0\u00a0Since I posted this, the diagnosis has changed to costochondritis, based on my doc's ability to palpate the pain.\u00a0\u00a0She's suggested trigger point injections of lidocaine, but I'd prefer to try accupuncture first to see if that provides any relief.\u00a0\u00a0I've cut out all caffeine in the hopes that may calm any inflammatory response I'm having internally.\u00a0\u00a0To me, it feels like the costochondritis is really a \"catch-all\" diagnosis and I feel uncertain that they truly know what's wrong with me.\u00a0\u00a0I reviewed the lab work that I had done at the ER (now going on 6 weeks ago, when the sharp pain originally began) and the only deviations were as follows:\u00a0\u00a0Neutrophils elevated (79.9); Lymphocytes low (13.7), Glucose elevated (107 - although I had eaten dinner just before blood was drawn; anion gap low (6); and blood in the urine of 4+ (I was not near menstruation at the time).\u00a0\u00a0If you have any further advice on costochondritis or whether or not I should be concerned about these lab results (the ER doc nor my PCP weren't too concerned), I'd appreciate your insight.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks so much for getting back to me.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you strength and fortitude to continue helping the victims of the California fires.",

    "question": "I've been having sharp pain in both of my upper breasts, radiating to my back and through the armpit, for the last 4 weeks.\u00a0\u00a02 weeks ago, I tested positve for the Influenza virus.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor believes my pain could be pleurisy, however, I question that since it's painful to the touch.\u00a0\u00a0I'm taking Ibuprofen (and occassional vicodin) for the pain, but it persists.\u00a0\u00a0The pain started right after I ended my first dose of Clomid, which led me to wonder if I was having a severe reaction.\u00a0\u00a0However, it's been over one month now (how long does Clomid stay in the system?).\u00a0\u00a0Chest x-ray, ekg and echo all are normal.\u00a0\u00a0 CBC with differential also shows normal levels (no elevation in WBC).\u00a0\u00a0SED rate was normal (however, could be masked by all of the Ibuprofen I'm taking).\u00a0\u00a0I'd like to get a second opinion, but I'm not even sure what type of physician to see (I saw an Internist for the original diagnosis).\u00a0\u00a0Pain is intense and keeps me up at night.\u00a0\u00a0Any insight is greatly appreciated as I really want this to go away.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
