            "answer": "Adjusting insulin should be done on a cautious basis, adjusting only by a small amount and then keeping it there 2-3 days to see the result. You sound like maybe you are adjusting too much at a time if you are going from frequent lows to frequent highs. Also, so you know if your basal dose is correct? If your basal is off, you would see it by lows or highs that took place at other times than 2 hours after meals such as fasting, before meals or bedtime. You need to get your basal right before you fiddle with your bolus. You don't want to eat less (to diet I assume) and raise insulin. The less you eat the less bolus insulin you need. I would suggest figuring out your insulin carb ratio so that you are bolusing the correct amount for what you eat. If you can't afford doctor visits, you need to learn about managing your own doses better. I would recommend the book Using Insulin by John Walsh. Also, if you want, send me a private message and I'll give you a website where you can get advice from a lot more people with diabetes.",
