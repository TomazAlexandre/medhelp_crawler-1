    "question": "Here's my story so far. Any insight is\u00a0\u00a0appreciated!\u00a0\u00a0I am exactly 5 weeks today and the whole time I have had spotting, not bleeding though.\u00a0\u00a0Which i believe is caused by my occupation. I am currently thinking of quitting. Cramping about twice but nothing unbearable.\u00a0\u00a0I have had many pregnancy symptoms,\u00a0\u00a0including sore breasts and nipples, cravings,\u00a0\u00a0nausea and vomiting,\u00a0\u00a0frequent urination etc. My hcg levels rose but didn't double but the doctor said there was nothing to worry about.\u00a0\u00a0Same with the spotting.\u00a0\u00a0I have already been diagnosed with gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like my anxiety is through the roof because I feel like it's been such a scary road already and I'm only 5 weeks! The doctors reassure me that everything is fine and we'll just keep a close eye on the baby. I have my almost 8 weeks ultrasound on the 10th which will hopefully calm me down. But can anyone offer and advice, similar experience or reassurance?\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts are appreciated!!!",
