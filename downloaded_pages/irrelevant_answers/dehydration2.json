            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.I would definitely recommend talking to your doctor about this episode. It is possible that your blood sugar was low. Make sure that you are eating and drinking throughout the day. Your doctor will be able to examine you and to check your blood pressure and if necessary check your blood levels to give you a better idea of what caused the episode. Then they can help you take steps to keep it from happening again.Cathy",
