            "answer": "\"Can frequency urination become an indicator of our actual glucose level?\"Yes, somewhat, but not all the time. Going by the numbers you posted, which are very good, diabetes doesn't appear to be the culprit of your frequent urination. Go see your doctor, and possibly an Urologist, to check for an enlarged prostrate. When you urinate and it doesn't feel like you're emptying your bladder, or you dribble, or no feeling of force [can't put out a lit match 3 feet away; ie you fail the fire dept test] check your prostrate. Also, check for urinary tract infection, or an overactive bladder.",

            "answer": "I agree as well. There could be some other underlying issue going on. Frequent urination also has dual symptoms with some other issues such as: Kidney stones, bladder conditions/infections, prostate issues, drinking too much coffee or other diuretic, and drinking too much alcohol. There are actually tons of other issues which can go on for quite a while that we normally wouldn't catch on to until they get bothersome.",

When you consume little carb, no water excess is needed and is therefore flushed out through urine.
