            "answer": "If you donated a kidney, no, he wouldn't need dialysis, if everything went right, and the donation wasn't rejected. You have to have a lot of tests before to make sure you are a good match, but it does work. One of my ministers at church was donated a kidney by his daughter. He also suffered kidney failure from complications of diabetes. Good luck, and what a wonderful gift to your father if it works out.",
