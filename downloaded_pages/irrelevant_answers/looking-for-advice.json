            "answer": "Has her doc talked to her about anything at all that could help her? I dont know if the diabetes and blood pressure can cause it, but anything could be possible. I wish I knew more about this and could be of more help, but I would suggest she try again. I heard a statistic one time a few years ago that 4 out o5 5 pregnancies are M/C. Also have her toc to an obgyn to see what they say. Or you may want to even call and ask one for her. Good luck to your friend....and God Bless!!!",

    "question": "My friend in the 8 yrs I have known her has had 4 miscarriages. The doctors have never given her a reason for them. She is a diabetic, with high blood pressure. She desperately wants a baby of their own. She always loses the baby early. I am looking for some kind of hope for her. I know she would be a great mother. And her DH is a great guy and is great with my kids. If anyone knows of some kind of meds she could ask her doctor about or something she can do herself, that would be awesome. I greatly appreciate the help and advice......",
