            "answer": "I am not expert but I can tell you that my temperature is often below normal - 98.6. Many timesI have had a temperature in the mid 97 range and I was told not to worryabout it. I doubt that everyone always tests at 98.6 and my guess is that their mainconcern after your surgery would be a fever. That might indicate an infection which is probably one of the major risks of any surgical procedure. I wouldn't worry but I would keep an eye of it and any significant departures from your 97.2.This is from the Mayo Clinic.http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/body-temperature/AN01513\"Question:For the last several days, my body temperature has been around 96.9 F \u0097 according to an oral thermometer. Should I be concerned about it being too low?- Betty / VirginiaMayo Clinic breast-health specialist Sandhya Pruthi, M.D., and colleagues answer select questions from readers.AnswerProbably not. Although normal human body temperature is usually stated as 98.6 F (37 C) orally, it actually ranges from 97.5 to 98.8 F (36.4 to 37.1 C). Some people have temperatures in the 96 F range and feel fine. Your body temperature is not considered dangerously low until it is below 95 F (35 C).Mild reductions in body temperature are often temporary and don't indicate a serious problem or condition. For example, your temperature normally is lower in the morning than in the evening. The most common cause of a lower-than-normal body temperature is exposure to cold. But occasionally, a low body temperature can indicate an underlying problem or condition, such as:* Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)* Diabetes* Adrenal gland insufficiency (Addison's disease)* Hypothalamus dysfunction* Liver failure* Kidney failure* Widespread infection (sepsis)* Excessive use of alcohol or illicit drugs* A side effect of certain medications, such as phenothiazines, barbiturates, opiates, clonidine, lithium and benzodiazepinesIf your low body temperature persists, consult your doctor\"Mike",

            "answer": "I am pretty sure they want you to monitor your temp for fever---a sign of infection. If it goes up to, say, 100, then yes, you should call the facility where you were treated. My own personal \"Normal\" body temp is 97.5....If I get to 99 I have a fever and feel sick. Everyone is different. Also, if you lost a lot of blood, anesthesia, shock, etc., all indicators of \"lower\" body temps. You are still in the \"totally fine\" zone.",
