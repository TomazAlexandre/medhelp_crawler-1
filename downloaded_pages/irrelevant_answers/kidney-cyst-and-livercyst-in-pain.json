            "answer": "Hi,At this point, it may be difficult to tell if these cysts may be explained by a single disease condition.But this is not far from being unlikely.I have some questions just to clarify some things:Was your friend born with only one kidney?Or has she underwent any kidney surgeries before?Any history of previous instrumentation to the area?If your friend was born with only a single kidney then it may be that the appearance of these other cysts in the body may have a familial or genetic association.I would suggest that at this point the cysts may need to be managed separately. The thyroid cysts and liver cysts need to be managed based on established protocols.As for the kidney cyst, I suppose an ultrasound was done to assess the cyst? How was it classified in the scan? Was it a simple cyst or where there any signficant characteristics noted in the image?",

            "answer": "Hi,How large is the kidney cyst?Would you know the range of your friend's blood pressure ( minimum BP and maximum BP)?Large simple renal cysts have been associated with cases of hypertension.This may be due to the size of the cyst enabling it to impede or add pressure on renal vessels and tissues. Destruction of these tissues and decrease in renal blood flow may cause the body to increase salt reabsorption (sodium) and lead to increase in blood pressure.You may discuss this with your friend' s physicians.Of course,other underlying conditions have to be ruled out such as PKD and renal artery stenosis or narrowing.Hypertension and diabetes which may affect the kidneys should also be ruled out.",

            "answer": "Hi,Was hypertension ruled out by her physician? In this case a secondary form of hypertension may be possible given the underlying kidney disease. Also, was an anemic state ruled out which may cause a drop in BP, faintness and dizziness. Was a complete cardiac assessment done to rule out underlying cardiac factors that may also present as hypertension and loss of consciousness?With regards to the diet, it is best to include fresh fruits and vegetables in the diet except pickled vegetables and dried or candied fruits. Also avoiding commercially prepared desserts and pastries ,whole wheat grains, cereal or cracker with high salt content may be necessary. It\u00a0\u00a0may be essential that a nutritionist\u00a0\u00a0help plan her diet.
