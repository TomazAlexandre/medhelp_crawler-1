            "answer": "Hi Michelle,I had severe nerve damage from a spinal cord injury.\u00a0\u00a0They had me on a medication called Neurontin and a huge dose of it at that.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that it helped tremendously.\u00a0\u00a0I had it a little worse, it felt like my arms had 3rd degree burns.\u00a0\u00a0However, even when I stopped the meds, my arms still hurt quite a bit.\u00a0\u00a0I am happy to report that it definitely gets better with time. My accident was 14 years ago and today I have almost no pain at all.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe once in a blue moon I'll feel a little burn but NOTHING like it used to be. Our bodies are beautiful things and if we give time to heal, it usually will.I hope you feel better very soon!",

    "question": "Hi two months ago I got a small cut on my hand immediately I had pins and needles numbness in my hand after a couple of days I was referred to the hospital to be told it could be nerve damage but the hospital wasn't sure and wanted to open my hand up to look even though they didn't know what was wrong so I decided not to have the operation for other reasons and I wanted to see if I could gain some feeling back. Two months later the feeling is back in two of the three damaged not 100per cent but it's back one finger isn't completed back but overall my hand is a lot better. I feel like I have cramp in my hand often get the feeling cold spots on my damaged fingers and pain in my finger tips. Does anyone have Any advice or know whether the nerve damage will repair it's self?",
