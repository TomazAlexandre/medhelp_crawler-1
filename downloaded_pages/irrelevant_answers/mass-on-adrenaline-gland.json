Im also a smoker and a coffee drinker and lots of stress but the doctor didnt mention any of those things he just said that it is because of blood counts being too low. Like I said he didnt say much.

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!As far as I can understand, you were being evaluated for pain (may be in the abdomen). During a scan an adrenal mass was found. Generally a mass more than 6 cm in greatest diameter on adrenal gland is considered for further evaluation. Smaller masses are left as such and are generally not the cause for any symptoms.A 24-hour urinary free cortisol measurement to evaluate for Cushing's syndrome is done for bigger masses along with other hormone essays for pheochromocytoma; and a serum potassium level for hyperaldosteronism.It is difficult to comment beyond this without further information.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "HiVery thirsty, drinking a lot of water and urinating a lot along with losing weight\u2014you must get evaluated both for diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Diabetes mellitus is a disease of pancreas with these symptoms. Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disease of adrenal gland\u00a0\u00a0and/or of pituitary in the brain. Both the problems can co-exist in a person. In DI the kidney is unable to concentrate urine. Potassium levels are low in the blood.It would be good if you could see an endocrine specialist. Maybe your PCP can help get a referral.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
