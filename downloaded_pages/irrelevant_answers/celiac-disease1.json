            "answer": "I have been a diabetic for about 16 years now and my mother just found out last year that she has Celiac disease.\u00a0\u00a0You do have to specifically ask to be tested for it because most doctors don't have a clue about it( we've found that out from experience).\u00a0\u00a0There are blood tests that can be done to detect some abnormality but the only way you would have a difintative answer is to have a biopsy done of your small intestine.\u00a0\u00a0Celiac destroys the lining there and the villa stop growing and you can't absorb nutrients.\u00a0\u00a0One of the most common syptoms are extreme weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0Celiac disease isn't just a allergy to wheat glueten but is also attributed to barley and wheat.\u00a0\u00a0I had some of the same symptoms that you mentioned before but I don't have celiac.\u00a0\u00a0I was told by doctors that the symptoms were stess related, probably from worrying that I might have the disease",

            "answer": "Hi. I have both celiac disease and juvenile diabetes.Celiac disease is when your body is intolerant to gluten(wheat, barley, rye oats). It is a very serious disease. If not treated, it could cause a lot of problems in the future. The only treatment is to be on a strict gluten-free diet.Its hard at first, but after a while it becomes natural.*If you would like any more advice I'd be more than happy to help!",

It blocks the nausea urge in the brain. I'm now able to eat some, still having difficulty urinating hardly at all, maybe 1/2 to 1 cup a day. Now I'm worried my kidneys are shutting down.",
