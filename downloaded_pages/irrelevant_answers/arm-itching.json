Have you been around any potentially harmful chemicals? Try a cortizone or benadryl cream to help with the itching. If a rash is present or if there is any puss or drainage, keep the area clean and watch for infection. Make sure you see a doctor if this keeps bothing you or gets out of control.",

It can be due to metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism.
