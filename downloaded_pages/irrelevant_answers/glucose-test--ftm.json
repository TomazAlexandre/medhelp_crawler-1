            "answer": "I know when I did mine they did it to early an I had to do a retake. They just want to make sure you don't develop gestational diabetes cause that can put you at a high risk pregnancy. My doctor had me do my second one at 28 weeks. But normally you just do it once unless it was done to early or you come out positive then you do another one but for 3 hours",

            "answer": "It's normally taken between 24 and 28 weeks. Doctors will ordered it sooner if there's history of GD or type I or II diabetes in your family. There's 3 different tests that can be ordered, 1, 2 and 3 hours long. I was administered the 2 hour test, but everyone on here seems to have been given the 1 hour test. If you fail, they'll have you take the 3 hour test. If you have gestational diabetes, it can cause complications during pregnancy.",
