Remember, anyone can put anything on a website. I have used the government website without any problem.clinicaltrials.gov/show/00001870www.doctoryourself.com/diabetes.htmlwww.healthwell.com/healthnotes.cfm?contentid=37310006&org=newhopePlease consult with your physician before changing your regimen.

            "answer": "galzee,I also read that somewhere. And the thinking goes something like this:Vitamin C and glucose are very similar molecules. And they both rely on the same transport mechanism for entering the cells. When there is a lot of glucose in the bloodstream, as in a hyperglycemic diabetic, Vitamin C is \"out competed\". Which is why people with diabetes don't absorb Vitamin C efficiently.Because Vitamin C performs some important functions, not absorbing it properly can have serious consequences. Vitamin C is used in creating collagen, which maintains the integrity of all the tissues in the body. And, as a powerful anti-oxidant, it repairs oxidation damage. It is thought that lack of Vitamin C in the cells could aggravate the development long term complications of diabetes.Cheers,Mark",

    "question": "Maybe someone with a technical interest can help me on this.While doing research on Vitamin C, I came across some interesting info on oxidation and diabetes. Research shows that free radicals and oxidative stress play a major role in both the initial cause of diabetes and development of long-term complications.In view of this, development of effective anti-oxidant therapy must be a major opportunity. But not much seems to be happening on this front. And my question is, why? Studies show that diabetics have low levels of Vitamin C. But no-one in my \"medical team\" has ever suggested that I take a supplement.Studies using small nutritional doses (<1000mg)of Vitamin C have produced disappointing results. But use of large amounts of Vitamin C has never been fully investigated.Is there any reason for this?",
