            "answer": "meke, several questions come to mind that may have a bearing on your situation. How long she has had diabetes, her age and if there were other issue's with her hospitalization.Dehydration can cause ketones to concentrate in the urine which can possibly cause a false positive. Normal glucose readings, with positive ketones, can also occur when a person is vomiting, etc.\u00a0\u00a0The body starts burning fat for energy.Liquids are important to help flush the keytones, however, since she was in the hospital three weeks ago, I would call her physician to see if anything else should be done.I wish you the best with your daughter.\u00a0\u00a0If there is anything more that we can help you with, please don't hesitate to contact us.",
