            "answer": "\"...metformin which made me physically very drained, not tired or weak, but very loose,...\"All medications come with side effects. Not everyone tolerates them equally. One side effect of Metformin is weakness. Also, taking Metformin in quarters is below the recommended dose and is so minimal, I highly doubt it has any affect on helping to lower your glucose [blood sugar] level. You should check with your doctor about other oral diabetes medications, that is, if you wish to continue treating your potential diabetes.\"...I do not have any symptoms at all.\"Not everyone has diabetes symptoms. Some people having high glucose levels for long periods of time feel normal because they have gotten use to the symptoms.\"I believe I have high blood sugar but unrelated to a diagnosis of diabetes\"High glucose levels can mean diabetes but also other diseases like Cushings Syndrome, a heart attack or stroke, hyperthyroidism, and pancreas issues to name a few. If don't feel you have diabetes ask your doctor for tests to rule out other diseases related to high glucose levels.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the answer WaveRider. I was also prescribed Enalapril Maleate at the same time so I do not know if that means the high sugar is indicating something else.\u00a0\u00a0asok475-Readings?\u00a0\u00a0About two weeks ago I had another blood sugar test and the test indicated my sugar went down with taking a quarter of the Metformin so I do not know if at times my blood sugar just spikes or if that small dose had any effect. The Enalapril is to regulate liver enzymes but I'm not sure.\u00a0\u00a0I wish I'd pay more attention to my health information.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway I really did not take the Enalapril because I wanted to see what the Metformin alone would do.\u00a0\u00a0Now however, after taking the follow up blood test I am taking the Enalapril.\u00a0\u00a0Again, however, I have not had any symptoms before taking the medication and I am not having any symptoms after starting the two medications.",

    "question": "I have always, as far as I can remember, had high sugar level results when having my blood tested for annual check-ups.\u00a0\u00a0However nothing was ever done about recommendations or advice from the various doctors over the years.\u00a0\u00a0Recently after a yearly physical a doctor started me on metformin which made me physically very drained, not tired or weak, but very loose, if that is the right word, and sort of wiped out in a physical sense.\u00a0\u00a0The prescription dose was 500 mg.\u00a0\u00a0I cut the pill up into quarters so I only take a quarter of it now which has decreased the \"wiped out\" feeling tremendously.\u00a0\u00a0My main point is, I really do not have any symptoms that I can tell, of either high blood sugar or diabetes as far as my daily trek through life goes.\u00a0\u00a0I did not, do not have any complaints where I would go to a doctor and say \"look I feel terrible in this way, or this is happening to me.\"\u00a0\u00a0And so the doctor would say \"oh, considering your blood results you have diabetes, take this metformin prescription.\"\u00a0\u00a0I am taking the metformin because the doctor is advising it.\u00a0\u00a0I do believe the doctor said it may just be precautionary because of my age-70.\u00a0\u00a0But the prescription has made no difference in my physical or healthful observations of myself from when I never took it.\u00a0\u00a0One person said to me I have diabetes because I am taking metformin.\u00a0\u00a0I said, no, I do not have diabetes, I do not have any symptoms at all.\u00a0\u00a0I believe I have high blood sugar but unrelated to a diagnosis of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Is there any definitive, all inclusive explanation for all of this?",
