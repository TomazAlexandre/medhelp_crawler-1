            "answer": "Forgot to add, I am almost 1 1/2 years post surgical menopause. Both ovaries are gone. I have not been treated for hormone imbalance, aka low estrogen. My skin has done weird things ever since the surgery. I wonder if the low estrogen is contributing to the slow healing?",

For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have very sensitive skin, I scratched my stomach about 6 days ago and developed a scratch. It was deep enough to produce a scab. I have slight redness around the scratch and slight, ever so slight tenderness when touching it. However, I went to a dermatologist today who said the scratch was\u00a0\u00a0not infected, it was only inflamed. She said there is a difference and mine is inflamed, told me to put vaseline or triple antibiotic on it.My question is why is it taking so long to heal? Parts of the scab will also break apart and then scab again. It is so weird. If it is not infected which she said it wasn't, it was just inflamed, then what caused the inflammation and what is taking so long to heal?I have recently been tested for diabetes and I do not have that, I even had general bloodwork done and everything was fine.",
