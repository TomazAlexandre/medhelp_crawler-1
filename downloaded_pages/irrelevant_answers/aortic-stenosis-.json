    "question": "Follow up to previous post about husband (am RN). Year ago (59 yrs) echo showed:\u00a0\u00a0ARoot 3.43 cm ACS 2.06 cm LA 5 cm LVPWs 5.6 ES 3.0; LVPWd 2.06; conclusions:cannot r/o BAV, flow across AV 282 max grad 32 AVA 1.4 cm2; concentric LVH; considerable aortic root/cusp calcification; somewhat limited systolic excursion; mod. AI; stress test \"normal\" reached 78% max HR, LVEF 48%; calculated EDV 139 ESV 72.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Echo now shows following progression:\u00a0\u00a0AV peak syst. flow 3.4 M/s, max grad. 47 mmHg/mean 28; AVA .9 cm; conc LVH, normal size; cons. AR/Acusp calc. limited sys. excursion consitent w/ calcific AS;moderate ASand AI; mild MV sclerosis mild regurg. norm EF PMhx:\u00a0\u00a0diabetes II 2nd gallstone pancreatits; long standing HBP well controlledQUESTIONS: 1.\u00a0\u00a0Internist thinks this is not BAV - what is your think on AS with this much calcification not being BAV - isn't this a young age to have this much progression for normal valve?\u00a0\u00a0My understanding is that often difficult to identify on echo.\u00a0\u00a0Concerned about children being evaluated if BAV 2.\u00a0\u00a0This seems like rapid progression to me - at this time there are no SX; what is your impression. How fast will this continue to progress? 3.\u00a0\u00a0Obviously headed for surgery sooner rather than later - what recommendations/interpretation do you have including what steps to take next.\u00a0\u00a04.\u00a0\u00a0When would you recommend next echo?\u00a0\u00a0Should a cath be done at some point.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Have been followed by internist but I now feel we need a cardiologist's involvement.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you so much for your time and providing this service.\u00a0\u00a0My hope would be to use Cl. Clinics but we live in E. PA, so we will have to see what husband agrees to.",
