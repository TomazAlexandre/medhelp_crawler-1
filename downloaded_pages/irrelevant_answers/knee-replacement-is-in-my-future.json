            "answer": "jeanpeewee,you do not have to exersice to loose weight, also there are many exersizes that you can do that involve upper body that will help to burn calories.There is a golden rule concerning weight...If you dont put it in your mouth it wont stay as fat on your body.Because you do not exersice your body does not need as many calories so you must eat far less than you do now. Cut out 90% of your Carborhydrate intake and concentrate on Protien and veg that grows above ground. Joints do not wear out under normal use, get rid of the fat and see the difference. It worked in my case.",
