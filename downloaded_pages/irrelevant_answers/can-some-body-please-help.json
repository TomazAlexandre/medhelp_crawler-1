            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.From your description of symptoms, it certainly sounds that you are suffering from post viral fatigue syndrome that may originate after a long lasting viral infection or if you had viral illness plus underlying disorder such as anemia, diabetes etc. One may experience muscle pain, headache, no refreshing sleep, malaise, pains in joints and sometimes nerve compression symptoms (tingling/weakness). To diagnose this it is quite essential that your doctor first evaluate common accompaniment of other disorders such as anemia, hypothyroidism, diabetes, kidney or liver dysfunction and may be persistent (or not properly cured) infection. Meanwhile, you should keep your immunity high by taking a balanced diet, avoid stress, take brisk morning walk and take sufficient sleep. This will surely help you in recovering from your symptoms much faster. Hope this information proves helpful.Take Care & Regards!!!",
