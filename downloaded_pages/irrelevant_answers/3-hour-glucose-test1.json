            "answer": "GD isn't the big bad thing everyone makes it out to be!! Yes it isn't great to have it, and yes it can carry certain risks! If you do what is recommended by your Dr and watch what you eat it's easily manageable. If you do need insulin, so be it, do it correctly ask questions and listen to what you advised to do. My mother had GD with all 5 of her children and we were all born healthy as. I was borderline with my first and I just watched what I ate, and my son was perfectly healthy! You will be fine either way. :) don't stress.",
