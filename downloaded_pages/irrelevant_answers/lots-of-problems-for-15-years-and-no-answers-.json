            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!I read through your post very carefully and based on that I feel that you could possibly be suffering from glove-and-stocking neuropathy or from Sjogren's Syndrome. http://www.medicinenet.com/sjogrens_syndrome/page2.htm. Please consult a neurologist at the earliest. There are many causes of this nerve disorder including diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Upset stomach could be due to involvement of liver so food is not digested properly. Chances of your symptoms being due to autoimmune disorders like Sjogren's Syndrome are more. You will need to run more tests for the same.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
