            "answer": "My gallbladder recovery was kind of hard. I was in pretty bad pain for days. I thought maybe it was due to the fact that I couldn't eat for more than 2 weeks before my surgery, I was so sick and weak. But now I wonder if it was because I have this other problem. My incisions were sore for a while. That did go away. I am just scared about having this possible gatroparesis. I keep reading about it and it sounds like people are just suffering from it, that the medications aren't even helping. It seems like a lifelong thing too. No cure.",

            "answer": "Well, you are correct...there is no cure. I was diagnosed with gastroparesis 2 years ago, and I vomit at least 6 times a week. I lost 90 pounds..not that I didn't need to...but on the same token, I would much rather be fat than feel like **** all the time..The nausia is so much worse than vomiting, and I shoud be used to the vomiting, but each time I throw up, I cry like a baby...It hurts, I am weak, and I am miserable. I have taken all the meds that were prescribed for me, but none of them helped. I was told it is just something I have to live with. I too have bowel problems, and it's either constipation, or sever diareahea. Sorry to hear that you feel so bad...Hopefully you will start feeling better soon. I have noticed that it comes and goes...I feel decent for a week, and then I feel horrible for about 2 weeks.",

My children are great, and my grandchildren are wonderful, but every time I throw up, I pray for death, because it hurts so terribly bad in my stomach. I hope that they have mis-diagnosed you.

    "question": "I am a 36 year old woman. I have been having upper stomach pain for over 4 months now. I was first diagnosed with needing my gallbladder out. Had that out Oct. 1, and still have pain. I have no appetite, feel full all the time, have constsnt pain in the stomach, and have almost like a burning feeling in the stomach. I have lost 33 pounds. I have had many blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0I have had an endoscopy, colonoscopy, lower bowel follow through and just recently had a stomach emptying study. My dr. said that was positive. That my stomach is not emptying. He did not say I have gastroparesis, but everything I am reading on this applies to me. He has me now taking Erythromycin (the antibiotic) 4 times a day, once before each meal and once at bedtime. Says it should help with stomach digestion. I have also been taking Nexium once a day and Alprazolam for anxiety as needed.\u00a0\u00a0I am also on a diet which consists of no whole grains, no crusts, no raw fruits and veggies, only skinned and cooked and no meats unless ground. I have been taking the medicine for almost a week now, and feel no better. Does anybody who has this condition have any advice for me or suggestions which could help me? My life has not been the same in these 4 months. I don't do a lot of things I used to because I am in constant pain. I had also tried Metaclopramide back in Oct. That did seem to help me feel a little better after being on it for about a week, but after taking it for 2 weeks, I started getting bad side effects. I had the shakes really bad, my whole body would just shake. And my throat felt swollen. Another problem I am having is contipation. Ever since my gallbladder surgery. I was able to control it with taking 1 Citrucel a day. Then I had to increase it and was up to 4 a day. My dr. now has me taking a stool softener twice a day, and to take Phillips Milk Of Magnesia as needed. I have been taking these for about 4 weeks now. I still have to strain to go to the bathroom using the stool softeners. I take the Milk Of Magnesia about every 5 nights. Can this constipation be realted to my stomach not emptying? I have read on all the medications I am taking an none have the side effect of constipation.",
