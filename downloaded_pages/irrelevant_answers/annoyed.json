            "answer": "I can't agree more with the posters above......Kudos to you for turning down all the tempting items (our cravings can be difficult to turn down) and holding your own.

Good luck!!!!",

I see how it can suck not being able to have it and she shouldn't be eating and drinking it right in front of you if your diabetic and pregnant she should respect your feelings more than that. just my opinion",
