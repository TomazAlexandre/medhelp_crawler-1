            "answer": "You should see improvements in some of those symptoms. However, it depends on how much damage was done and how long you were hyperthyroid as well.\u00a0\u00a0No amount of correcting my thyroid levels will fix up my cracked off tooth enamel or muscle atrophy.I also had a lot of deficiency states since my stomach acid depleted and I was in major oxidative stress (hello skyrocketing thyroid peroxidase antibodies!).\u00a0\u00a0My appearance improved drastically taking B/C and E vitamins just to add. I just found this yesterday: \"CoQ10 levels in hyperthyroid patients were found among the lowest detected in human diseases.\" Honestly, if it's not one deficiency it's another. lol.Excerpt from the article: What thyroid patients should know about Oxidative Stress...\"When Oxidation become \u201cOxidative Stress\u201dOn the negative side, sometimes your body can lose the ability to take care of all the free radicals caused by the constant oxidation. (Collectively, all these free radicals are called \u201creactive oxygen species\u201d (ROS).) The body then becomes overwhelmed by the excess of oxygenated free radicals, causing all sorts of damage. And this is all termed \u201coxidative stress\u201d.Alarmingly, oxidative stress can cause the loss of one of your key and internally-natural antioxidants: glutathione. Glutathione is a powerful antioxidant produced by your own cells, and it neutralizes those free radicals/reactive oxygen species. It also works expertly with antioxidants vitamin C and E. And as your glutathione levels fall, a cascade of toxic deterioration and damage can also begin, from cells to tissues to organs.Scientists theorize, and studies propose, that this is what leads to conditions like:chronic inflammationcognitive dysfunctionAlzheimerspremature agingParkinson\u2019sSickle Cell Anemiaautismheart diseaseatherosclerosisrenal diseaselung diseasecancerOxidative stress may also be negatively affecting your methylation process, such as the MTHFR enzyme.Some Causes of oxidative stressThere are quite a few situations mentioned in articles and studies which can cause your body to be overly stressed from the results of oxidation and all the reactive oxygen species. They include, but are not limited to:excess endurance exercisingexcess weight liftinglack of key antioxidant nutrients like Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Selenium, Magnesium and other mineralsexcess radiation or sunlightsmoking (huge cause of oxidative stress)excessive drinking or drug useover-exposure to toxins in our air, water and foods like pesticides, chemicals, heavy metals and moreprescription medicationsprocessed foods with all their artificial dyes, additives or flavoringsexcess physical traumaGraves disease aka hyperthyroidismexcess copper levels from the MTHFR defect\"",

            "answer": "Simply having a low TSH does not make one hyper.\u00a0\u00a0TSH is a pituitary hormone that signals the thyroid to produce thyroid hormones.\u00a0\u00a0It becomes pretty much useless in many of us, particularly, when taking a medication with a T3 component, such as Armour Thyroid.You're only hyper if your symptoms are caused from excessively high levels of Free T3 and Free T4, which are the actual thyroid hormones and I don't even see your levels.\u00a0\u00a0If you have them, please post them, along with reference ranges, which vary lab to lab and have to come from your own report.Some symptoms are shared with hypothyroidism, such as ear ringing and hair loss.\u00a0\u00a0My own TSH has been at < 0.01 (recently came up to 0.01) for the past 6 years and I've never once been hyper.\u00a0\u00a0My hair loss only stopped once my thyroid hormone levels were allowed to rise, in spite of low TSH.",

            "answer": "I was hyperthyroid for a year. I also worsened my insulin resistance and developed diabetes too. I believe my fluid retention with hyperthyroidism was due to insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0Who knows what other damage was done.Also, I didn't know how down I was until I started B vitamins. It's like a switch. Two days later I was happy. I thought about it for a moment then it clicked. B vitamins. I love B vitamins. :)I still have muscle atrophy. One area of atrophy is ahem...behind. lol.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sitting on bone basically which is uncomfortable! I don't have much of an appetite and I just read 0.7 grams of protein per pound of body weight is needed to gain muscle. For me that is 109 grams. A DAY. O_O This is not going to be easy.",

It's usually due to higher than normal blood glucose after eating carbs. In some cases it's due to blood sugar dropping too low after a meal. I think that is called reactive hypoglycemia. I'm no longer insulin resistant or pre diabetic. :)",
