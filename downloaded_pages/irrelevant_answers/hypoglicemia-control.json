            "answer": "Hey there!! You sound as frustrated as I am!! I tried just going on a water fast...lol, that didn't work either!I haven't been diagnosed w/ diabetes......yet! A month ago my AC1 was 6.5 and my fasting blood sugars are in the 115-124 range every morning. My Dr says I was put together backwards...lol. If I REALLY try to do good....limit bad carbs and refined sugar it seems that my sugar is higher than when I cheat...@ oreo cookies and milk, yummy!! I also get those spikes...I've gone from 83 to 176 in 7.30 minutes!! It doesn't feel good at all! The best thing I can tell you is to MAKE yourself eat a little something every 2 hrs or so....don't wait more than 3. Suggestions are 2 crackers w/peanut butter, handful of nuts, 1/2 an apple, strawberries, string cheese,1 pc toast w/peanut butter,sugar free protein drink or bar, anyway, you get the idea. I've been doing this for about 2 months and I don't have hardly any problems with the spiking anymore and I've also lost about 10 lbs. When my sugar would spike my face would get beet red and I'd break out in a sweat , mostly my face....I'm talking dripping off my chin sweat!! Lightheaded, trembling....etc,etc. I hope this helps, it won't hurt to try it.I'm not in the medical field in anyway but, over the last 2 yrs of fighting with this stuff I finally had to figure out what seemed to work best for me. Peace, Joyce",

    "question": "Tks for taking my questions. Male, 41, last A1C was 95 and fasting glucose down from 122 to 116 and lost 20 lbs and now in my target weight range. Should excercise more though. Mom is type 2 on insulin now 65 and dad on pills for a few yrs now. Risk factors are not in my favour.I have been diagnosed with glucose intolerance for now.Questions: I am getting hypo each day and readings are around 75 when I start feeling jittery. I go eat an apply then readings after 20 min or so spike to 140 range. Feel like ****. I notice that this is happening almost daily at the same time around 1:30 ish even if I eat lunch. I really don't know what to eat these days and how frequent to ward this off. I typically eat oatmean at 9 am and then a sanwhich around 12 but by 2 ish in the afternoon I feel like ****- don't know what to eat as it spikes my sugar. I am a little concerned now!Dr said not diabetic yet but could be there is a few yrs if I am not vigilant now.This morn I ate some choc chip pancakes and sweet croissant and then 1,5 hrs later bam- hypoglecimic!! What sould I avoid? And what about nights? Should I obstain from eating sweets before bed or high in sugars for fear of spikes etc ....Never had this until this last year its really gotten pronounced (symptoms). All A1C readings are good and fasting has come down. So its good that I am in control except for hypoglicemia?? Kindly advise. Thank you.",
