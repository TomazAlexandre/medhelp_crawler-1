            "answer": "Hi Misty, I'm not a pcos patient but an endo patient which is little related. Pcos and endometriosis are believe to have hormonal imbalance, either a high estrogen or a low progesterone. It can make a woman difficult to conceive. Both the diseases can be treated and doctors will definetely prescribe contraceptive pills to suppress or slow the growth. Vitamins and dietary supplements would really help you as my cousin also have the same problem like you and she conceive after 5 years of marriage. She took Ovacare and her dh took oligocare. Try to avoid food that has xenoestrogens coz they mimic estrogen and take more green leafy vegs coz they contain phytoestrogens.Hope metformin will help your diabetes.Wish u get well soon.",

I'm sorry that's so personal but I have notices a huge difference in my sex drive about 3 weeks after having it inserted. Did you use anything to help you get pregnant?",

            "answer": "Hi Misty are you only taking one tablet a day??I had erratic bleedings for months on end in 2009 and the longest i had my period was for 7months straight..I was concerned and scared that i was going to die of blood loss but then i made an appointment with my GP and found out that i might have polops. a week or so after that i got an ultrasound and scan done and i was diagnosed with PCOS. I was prescribed to take Metformin 500 mg tablets aswell. Within the first week i had to take one tablet a day and the next week i had to take 3 a day and carried on this way for 6 months taking 3 tabs a day. After 6 months i was fine and my periods went back to normal.so my advice to you is maybe you might need to start taking 3 tablets a day:-/well i wish you all the best in getting your periods back to normal.",

    "question": "Hi everyone!I'm still kind of new at this so bear with me.\u00a0\u00a0My name is Misty and I am 23 years old. About 4 months ago, I was diagnosed with PCOS. I was also told that I had type 2 diabetes that is uually associated with it. I am currently taking metformin for the diabetes and my doctor said in the long run it would help with fertility. I have CRAZY periods!! I'm on it now, and have been on it since May 20th. They never stop! I have to go in frequently to check my blood count to make sure I don't need blood. I have tried depot, pills, more pills, ring, and patch with no success of making my period normal. I have recently had an IUD put in because my doctor thinks that it may stop my period. Has anyone done this? And if so, did you still bleed for 2 months after having it put in?\u00a0\u00a0I'm still new at knowing about PCOS and to be honest it scares me a little. I have no children and would love to have some one day.Thank you so much!Misty",
