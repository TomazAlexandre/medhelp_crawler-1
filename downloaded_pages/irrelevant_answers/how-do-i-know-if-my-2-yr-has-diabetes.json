But you should get him in to his pediatrician soon to have a test, just to make sure. When in doubt, ask a doc!Good luck",

            "answer": "Hi Betty,I'm a volunteer on this forum and a diabetic myself for 11 years. I agree with the comment above that, although 142 seems a little over for a non-diabetic, usually the numbers for undiagnosed diabetics are much higher. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't have it checked out. Excessive thirst and urination could be signs of diabetes and I would advise you to have your child examined by a physician. Tell him of your concerns and have him do a blood test so you can be sure. Good luck and take care.",
