            "answer": "It's good to see that you are trying to manage your glucose levels b4 they get out of control.An OGTT requires you to be sedentary 2 hours post test. Being active 1 hour post defeated your \"homemade\" test. See this link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_testQ: \"What can be the normal glucose level after 3-4 hours lunch or dinner time\"A: Glucose peaks 2-3 hours after meals where the normal value is <180 mg/dl and the optimum is <140 mg/dl. Four hours you should be at or close to normal levels.Q: \"If i make daily activity is it normal to have lower values?If i make exercise , can this lower my glucose level.\"A: Appears these are the same question on activity worded differently. Yes, daily exercise helps to lower your glucose.Q: \"I learned that during exercise insulin is generated and that can lower my gluce level rapidly.\"A: See this link http://www.faqs.org/faqs/diabetes/faq/part1/section-15.htmlQ: \"Now i bougt a glucose meter, maybe it is better to make my own test at home while i am sitting.\"A: Read and understand the instructions that came with the meter. Or, Google the make and model number for a user guide. Its important that you understand how to use the meter correctly or you will get false positive readings.",

    "question": "Hi, i made up an OGTT test (75 gr) and my glucose level after 2 hours is 43 mg/dl which can be a hypoglycemia.I am not quite sure about the accuracy of this test becuse after 1 hour i was active and i think that this can lower my glucose level.My questions are : What can be the normal glucose level after 3-4 hours lunch or dinner time.(mine is lower after 4 hours)If i make daily activity is it normal to have lower values?If i make exercise , can this lower my glucose level.I learned that during exercise insulin is generated and that can lower my gluce level rapidly.Now i bougt a glucose meter, maybe it is better to make my own test at home while i am sitting.",
