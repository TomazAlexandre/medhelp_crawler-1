    "question": "I'm a type 1 diabetic on the Minimed insulin pump. Last year I took a group of young women camping in the mountains at altitude of 9,000 ft, about 6,000 ft higher than where we live. After the first day at camp my blood sugar was running 300+ and stayed high for the 3 days of the camp. Eating and activity levels were close to normal, and I could not explain the high blood sugar. Wondering if the altitude effects the performance of the pump, or effect of the insulin. Any suggestions would be appreciated since I'm preparing to make the camping trip again this summer.",
