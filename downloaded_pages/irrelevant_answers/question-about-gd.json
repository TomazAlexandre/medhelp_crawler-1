            "answer": "Beef jerky, string cheese, I would eat one serving of carbs with as much protein as I wanted every 2 to 3 hours. Definitely no sugar but it helps to walk for at least 15 min after each meal. Watch out with fruits Iuusually count them as my carb when I would snack. I had GD last pregnancy and it was a challenge but I stuck to my diabetic diet and was able to control it. The great thing about it is I only gained 26 lbs total, unlike this time around I'm 30 weeks and have already gained 27! Good luck and remember its only temporary you will get to eat your treats soon:)",
