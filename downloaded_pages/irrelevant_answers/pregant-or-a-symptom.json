    "question": "I am new to this site... Hello everyone! I had diabetes during my first pregancy about 1 year 1/2\u00a0\u00a0ago w/ my DD who has Down Syndrome. I got pregant while I was on the pill but recently I have switched to the patch. A week ago I started getting nausea and vomiting, I thought I was pregant. But it couldn't been possible only because I had a four day period when the nausea started! I took the test and it was neg. I had the patch on three other months and never felt these symtoms... Can I possibly be prg., and it not show on the test (CVS Brand) or can it just be that my boby is now reacting to this medication? Has anyone expericened this before or anyone you know?",
