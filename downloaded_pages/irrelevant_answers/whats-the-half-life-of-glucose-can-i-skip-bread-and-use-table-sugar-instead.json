            "answer": "Hi,sorry about your tummy problem.\u00a0\u00a0The wholee issue with eating something is that you want the energy spread out as evenly as possible over the day.\u00a0\u00a0If you just take sugar you will get an energy rush when your blood sugar is high, but then when the blood sugar drops (which it will do quickly) then you will need more food quickly.Better to eat small amounts of real food very frequently than just take sugar, I'd think.Have you discussed your eating probelm with your doctor?\u00a0\u00a0For people having trouble eating there are some liquid diets that may be used temporarily with products like Ensure, among others.",
