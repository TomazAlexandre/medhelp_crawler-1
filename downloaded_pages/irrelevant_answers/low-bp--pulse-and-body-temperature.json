            "answer": "Hello,Sorry, I have not been on the site lately. To answer your question... my other symptoms are blurry vision at times, sensitivity to bright lights, fatigue. I have hypothyroidism and have been treated for over 10 years and last year my rx was changed to generic by accident. I started having problems after that with my eyes. Perhaps just a coincidence but just thought you might want to know the other symptoms.I hope you find the answers you are looking for as I know how frustrating this all can be.Take care of yourself.",
