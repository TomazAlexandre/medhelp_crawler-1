            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Aorta is the biggest artery, starting straight from the heart. It has an ascending portion, an arch, a descending portion, a thoracic portion and an abdominal one. Atherosclerosis can affect any portion and can be a generalized one too. It is due to adherence of platelets and cholesterol to the wall of arteries making them less elastic and blocking the lumen to blood flow. All the general causes of atherosclerosis apply to the aorta too such as diabetes, high cholesterol and triglycerides, high blood pressure, obesity, family history, sedentary life style, smoking etc. Diagnosis is by angiography. Treatment is by medication and surgery. Stents are usually not placed. Please consult a cardiologist and a vascular specialist. Take care!",
