My number is also 135 and I read that the cut off is 140 as well, but my clinic called me to tell me that my numbers were elevated so that I needed to take the 3 hour test and I told the nurse that there is no possible way that I can handle it if I could barely even tolerate the 1 hour test so the nurse suggested for me to check my blood glucose at home for one week which I have been doing for three days now and so far my numbers are good. It's a pain in the butt, but I'd rather do that than take that horrible test.",

After two hours it shouldn't be higher than 120.No sodas, no white bread, no sugar, no fried foods. No fast food.Whole grain bread,pasta,rice. Drink tea and water.In the morning your level should be no higher than 90. Take the big test. It's not for you but for a healthy baby. Put your big girl pants on and get it done. Smh...",

Additionally you can't take the pills as they are not allowed if you're pregnant. You will have to do the shots.I don't know what's wrong with you people. We all want to have healthy babies. Why not do everything and anything for them? Eat healthy, quit sugar and smoking, switch on your brains. The world doesn't stop turning if you follow some simple rules for a few months.",

My doctor apparently sets the cutoff at 130... I had a VERY hard time with the 1-hour screening (sick, weak, dizzy) and am unwilling to do the 3-hour test. What do you guys think about the 135 level? How many women with 135 actually have gestational diabetes????",
