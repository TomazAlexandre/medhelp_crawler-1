            "answer": "No, this doesn't sound right.Normally a combination of synthyroid and cytomel would be given.\u00a0\u00a0If you are taking cytomel, it should also be spread out through the day (ie. multiple dosing) not all at once.I would be rechecking on this or getting a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Another option considering that your FT3 is low is to switch to 'natural thyroid' whcih contains T3, T4 and other trace hormones.\u00a0\u00a0Armor is one, dessicated thyroid (erfa brand from canada), or compounded from pharmacy.",

            "answer": "OMG, where did the doctor get the idea to take you off of T4 and give you just T3? And why is 1.0 a good level for FT4? Yikes!!! Most hypos feel better with FT4 in the upper ranges, so I don't understand why the doc wouldn't raise your T4 and add Cytomel.Get a new doc, pronto.I found my new endo off this website:http://www.thyroid-info.com/topdrs/Make sure the doc specializes in thyroid, not just diabetes.:) Tamra",

            "answer": "I agree with what everyone else has said.\u00a0\u00a0First off -- 50 mcg of cytomel is a very large dose.\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, although your FT4 may be in the \"normal\" range, it doesn't appear very high at all, but without the actual reference range that's hard to say.Yes, by all means --- get a new doctor asap.",
