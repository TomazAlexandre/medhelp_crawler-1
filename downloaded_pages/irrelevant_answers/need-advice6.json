The Miracle of life is such a beautiful thing and you should feel proud and beautiful!\u00a0\u00a0Some men just don't know how to handle the change of pregnancy and others are actually scared they'll hurt the baby! Talk to him openly about your concerns :) I am also overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 4 weeks 3 days and I think I ALREADY look pregnant to the outside world. And everyone thinks I'm further along haha moral of the story is to love yourself and roll with the punches as they come :) I don't have any advice on the clothing unfortunately.\u00a0\u00a0I wear alot of dresses anyway so I'm going to stick with regular clothing as long as possible :) best of luck mama!",

    "question": "So I'm a ftm and I'm high risk because of me being so overweight. I'm 20.6 wks. My whole life I never had insecurity problems but lately I feel like I'm not attractive to my bf. I practically I have to beg him for sex which is a surprise because all my other ex's couldn't keep there hands off of me. But anyways I feel really ugly and extra fat. Before pregnancy I was a size 26 in clothes and I haven't gained weight because of the diet I'm on because of the gestational diabetes but I can't find anything cute to wear. Any advice on that? And another thing I'm so sad that I'm not getting a baby bump!! My stomach just drops and but don't look round which makes me sad. Only my family and friends know I'm pregnant I just wish ppl on the outside can notice and not just think I'm fat person!! Is there any other moms dealing with this and how did you cope",
