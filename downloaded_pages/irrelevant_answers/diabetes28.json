            "answer": "Exercise can affect blood sugars in various ways, either raising it or lowering it. Your blood sugars are too high. I would suggest talking to your doctor about changing or increasing your meds so that you get those numbers down. Meanwhile I wouldn't exercise if that is the usual result. If you want, send me a PM and I'll give you a website with many more diabetics who can give you input on how to integrate exercise into your life. But for now, see your doctor.",

            "answer": "Hi,With fasting blood sugars that high your meds are definitely not working.\u00a0\u00a0You are also getting what is called 'runners high\" where your liver dumps sugar in response to exercise.You need to show your doctor these results and work with him to get your numbers normalised.\u00a0\u00a0This may need a change in meds, or even a shift to insulin.Exercise is very good for you regardless, so don't get out of the habit of doing it.",
