I have gestational diabetes so now im on a low carb diet and I lost 10 pounds (of course I was overweight to begin with)... but for me more protien and less carbs have done the trick and I feel satisfied and less hungry.",

            "answer": "i second that first comment. look at what your eating because if your not getting enough protein in you definitely\u00a0\u00a0burn use up carbs alot faster because\u00a0\u00a0their easier to digest for your body then working to break down protein. so whenever you snack have protein\u00a0\u00a0with it like an apple with some cheese slices or peanut butter or almond butter (sugar free) granola with greek yogurt, veggies with hummus, hard boiled eggs are quick and easy (make a few one day and have them for the following\u00a0\u00a0days.) dont stress too much right now either its early and with all the hormonal chnages it can very well be alot of water retention. so reduce your salt intake and up the water. i try and get aboit 3liters in a day and i find on days i dont i can very well put on or retain about 2.5 kg of water weight. hope that helps but remember\u00a0\u00a0your body is doing something\u00a0\u00a0incredible right now and nature has a way of knowing what to do, so dont stress too much about the number. eat as well as you can and walk wherever\u00a0\u00a0you have the energy\u00a0\u00a0for it. :)",
