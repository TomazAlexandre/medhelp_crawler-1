            "answer": "I have a glucose intolerance so I try to avoid starches, added sugars and highy processed carbs. The thing I found I missed the most was pizza so I began making mine on portobello mushrooms. (I don't normally like portobello mushrooms either) It's not really a recipe per se and it really is just a simple idea but here is what I do.- remove stem and gills from mushrooms (they shrink considerably so I use about 6 for my husband and I)- brush mushrooms LIGHTLY (so not to add to much extra moisture) with olive oil and rub all over with minced garlic, salt and pepper.- bake in 450 deg oven for a few minutes (5 or so) to render out most of the moisture- remove from oven and spread with no sugar added pizza sauce or salsa,- layer with desired toppings such as peppers, onions, ham, spinach, low fat cheese, etc- return to 450 deg oven until heated through and cheese is melted.Personally, I really like it and it always satisfies my cravings for pizza.",

            "answer": "Morrocan Stewed Chicken.\u00a0\u00a0 Love it.Have it without the chickpeas...just add more diced veggies.Other very simple things--do you have a George Foreman grill?\u00a0\u00a0If you do, you're golden.\u00a0\u00a0You can season chicken breasts, boneless well trimmed pork chops, lean, well trimmed steaks, and through 'em on the Foreman for 6-8 min, and dinner is done.I often marinate cut up veggies in a bit of olive oil, salt/pepper/ balsamic vinegar and grill those on the Foreman, too.Roasted veggies are also fantastic.\u00a0\u00a0Put in a ziplock with olive oil and salt/pepper and roast at 450 for 10 min, stirring a time or two.\u00a0\u00a0Asparagus is especially good this way, but broccoli, cauliflower is also great.Go through the recipes here...there are many that are low carb or can easily be made that way.",

            "answer": "Everything sounds so good! I didn't know having dietary restrictions could mean I could still eat good tasting food!!!I DID have a George Foreman but I gave it to my hubby's friend (a bachelor in the inner city who honestly doesn't have much and I thought a grill would be great for a guy). I always follow the \"B\" rule (bake, broil, etc.) so there's less oil/fat.Oh yeah, I'm a freak about cooking meat (no pink!) because I took a sanitation and safety culinary class and let's just say people should be really careful about some things when they cook! We talked about E.Coli, staphlacoccus, salmonella to name a few.",

            "answer": "I've found with my pcos, just keeping my glucose levels stable helps a lot. You actually could probably do weight watchers ( because they stress fiber and avoiding simple sugars ) or of course eat from the diabetes sites too. Pretty much avoid the stuff you already know you need to avoid.\u00a0\u00a0It's not avoiding carbs as much as eating the right carbs.\u00a0\u00a0The south beach diet also is good for this.Are you changing your diet just because of the risk of diabetes from pcos or are you trying to conceive again and want to increase your fertility?grace",

I don't know why my weight is such an issue and problem, though, because my insulin is normal. I've been eating VERY well, I only drink water and milk, etc. I'm just trying to find what will work for me and I think curbing the carbs may help (not all carbs, just chilling out a bit with them).I'm trying to lose weight for both reasons actually.

            "answer": "Mushrooms are not only delicious, but many provide health benefits as well. A respectable source of protein on their own, mushrooms provide all the essential amino acids when combined with grains. Low in fat and carbohydrates, mushrooms also deliver useful amounts of some B vitamins and trace minerals.Healthy cooking methods include:1. In a pan or wok - saut\u00e9 in a bit of olive or grapeseed oil, preferably with mixed vegetables.2. In a pot - simmer in broth.3. On the grill - fresh shiitakes are delicious basted in a little teriyaki sauce. (Mix equal parts dry sherry or sake, one part reduced-sodium Japanese soy sauce, and one tablespoon of sugar for each cup of liquid.)It's important to thoroughly cook mushrooms since their cell walls are tough and the digestive system may have to work hard to get their full nutritional benefits. Heat will help eliminate that problem, as well as bring out the best flavors and textures.",

    "question": "Okay so I'm venturing into Diet Land (never been here before as I've never needed to until having children and developing PCOS). And I'm having a hard time figuring out the carb load. I don't have to be totally carb-free (that's just insane and ridiculous as we NEED carbs for energy) but it should be low carb (beans, whole wheat, etc.).So hit me with your favorite low carb recipes!!! I NEED THEM! I hate seafood, though. And meat really grosses me out but I will eat it. Chicken and beef mostly. I love veggie soups and some cream soups, especially with the cold coming. I don't know about sandwiches and wraps (LOVE them) on a low-carb diet?!",
