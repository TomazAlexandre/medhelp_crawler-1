            "answer": "Yes, it is time to take your daughter to a medical professional; but I would suggest a person with experience in anxiety disorders.\u00a0\u00a0Your pediatrician or family doctor should be able to suggest a referral, if necessary.\u00a0\u00a0Anxiety is a disorder which children do not outgrow, nor will it go away (but you have already figured that out).\u00a0\u00a0Your daughter needs help in learning how to control her anxieties/fears - treatment usually consists of intervention, therapy and possibly medication.\u00a0\u00a0By the way, the more ingrained the behaviours; the longer the treatment usually takes (and six years of age is not considered \"young\" for the beginning of treatment).\u00a0\u00a0Please do not hesitate - your daughter is really suffering.\u00a0\u00a0Let me assure you that you did not cause this disorder nor can you cure it (this has nothing to do with or without \"special time\" or the birth of her siblings ) - would you not seek help if your daughter had diabetes or some other disease/disorder?\u00a0\u00a0I wish you the best ....",

    "question": "My 6 yr old daughter is having a terrible time with separation anxiety. The anxiety seems to have gotten worse lately, I was hoping it was just a \"phase\" she was going through. She is experiencing nausea (almost to the point of vomiting), does not want me to leave her, afraid I am going to forget her somewhere, afraid something is going to happen to me, and has a terrible time with change. I am a stay-at-home mom 6 out of 7 days of the week. She started 1st grade last week. She cried \"all day\" per her teacher today to the point of her eyes almost swollen shut and having a horrible headache. I also have 18 mo. old twins and a 8 mo. old. I have tried to always make \"special time\" for my 6 year old since the other children have been born. I am considering taking her to a counselor and any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
