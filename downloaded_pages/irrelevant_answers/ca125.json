She is 74 and always been my rock.\u00a0\u00a0She has been so healthy (except for breast cancer 12 years ago that she \"skated\" through).\u00a0\u00a0My dad is the one with the triple bypass, pace maker and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 I know we all have to have our parents die but I just didn't want it so soon or like this.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter is 20 months old and hasn't gotten to know her grandma enough.\u00a0\u00a0My mom and dad adore their grandchildren and can't wait to give her the world....I really want to let them.Thank you....I keep saying this.... but all of you amaze me.",

I'm feeling well, lead an active life and my appetite is really good. Dx.Stage 4 ...Feb'04 and still going well. Stage 4 isn't an immediate death sentence.
