    "question": "I am now 21 weeks into my pregnancy and have had lower pain in my right side for a few months.\u00a0\u00a0Its usually\u00a0\u00a0when I move is when i feel it.\u00a0\u00a0Like when I lean over or am sitting down and go to stand up and sometimes its so painful i feel it when i walk in right leg. it doesnt feel like regular cramps or anything.\u00a0\u00a0 some people have said that it could just be my ligaments but Why would it be just in that one spot.\u00a0\u00a0And when it comes to having sex, I am always afraid to because sometimes it hurts if my husband goes in to deep. some people have told me that that could be just my cervix being brused from a previous time. my doctor has told me that i have a small birth canal and cervix. but its really hard for me to ask my doctor about these things because hes always in a hurry to leave and i never get the time to ask him.\u00a0\u00a0This week i find out what the baby is, so he has to stay in the office longer so i will ask him then but if you have any idea of what it could be could you let me know so that I can mention it to him.also 2nd thing is I have 4 imediate family members who are diabetic. I havent been tested for it yet but i was wondering if i should have been.3rd thing- It says in some books ive been reading that you should have frequent urination at the beginning of pregnancy and at the\u00a0\u00a0end. well im in the middle and I have to go about every hour or so and if i dont go in at least 2 to 3 hours my bladder begins to hurt severely. the other night i woke up to go and i couldnt stand up, I had to lean over and walk to the bathroom because it was hurting so bad and I usually have to go at least twice a night. I tried backing off of drinking alot of beverages but im so thirsty all the time. is there something i could do different or is this normal????",
