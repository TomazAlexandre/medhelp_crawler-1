            "answer": "Some people believe that if cortisol is CONSTANTLY high that eventually the adrenals will start malfunctioning and not be able to produce enough. IDK if this is backed by science though- could someone who knows more about this help me out? However, fat around the middle can be an indication of problems with insulin, such as diabetes or insulin resistance. Def. check it out with your endo if you're concerned!! They can run an OGTT if they suspect something related to that!!",

            "answer": "Good question Dom \u2013 Let me try to give you an answer (but please keep in mind there are obviously more variables at play) Cortisol has a variety of functions, one of which is that it plays an important role as a fuel in carbohydrates, proteins and fats metabolism process in the body. Low cortisol levels translate into a lower metabolism. So, if there are low cortisol levels in the blood, the body metabolism rate would be slower compared to those that have normal levels of cortisol (since there is a lack of fuel). Slow metabolism means that the body would need much longer duration to digest food before converting it into energy. Therefore low cortisol (as does high cortisol) can make you actually gain weight. In addition, it also becomes more difficult to follow fitness and weight loss routines as a result of fatigue and lethargy induced by low cortisol levels.Hope this helps!",

    "question": "Can anyone explain how Weight gain and adrenal fatigue are related.\u00a0\u00a0As I understand it those with adrenal fatigue can gain fat around the middle, but that kind of weight gain is associated with high cortisol levels. So if the adrenals are weak then how can this kind of weight gain occur?I know adrenal fatigue can through out the timing of many hormones but it still doesn't explain why high cortisol related weight gain occurs.\u00a0\u00a0Even if cortisol was unusually high at the wrong times (for one period in the day) would that be enough to make you gain fat around the mid-section?Can anyone explain this?",
