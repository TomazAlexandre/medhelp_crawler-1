    "question": "I wrote in yesterday about the problems I'm having, and I forgot to add a few things, so I'll start from the beginning.I'm a 20 year old female, and have been experiencing some odd things this past month.\u00a0\u00a0Here's my history.Since the time I was very small, I got these pains in my knees.\u00a0\u00a0Was tested for different things, doctors said it was growing pains.\u00a0\u00a0I still get these pain.\u00a0\u00a0Only about once a month, or if it's damp or humid.\u00a0\u00a0Was in a car accident about 2 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0Have lower back pain and pain betweent shoulder blades since accident.\u00a0\u00a0About 1 month ago, I started getting a sharp pain in my right temple with a sharp pain behind my eye.\u00a0\u00a0At this time, I was also getting a tingling feeling in my face.\u00a0\u00a0The pain then spread to the left side of my face.\u00a0\u00a0Saw my doctor, and she said it was probably just tension headaches.\u00a0\u00a0I also have TMJ.\u00a0\u00a0Within 2 days, the tingling spread to my arms, hands, legs and feet.\u00a0\u00a0It's not painful, just annoying.\u00a0\u00a0It comes at various times throughout my body.\u00a0\u00a0Just a sporadic tingling anywhere on my body such as my face, scalp, arms, legs, hands, and feet.\u00a0\u00a0I also had pain in my forearms for the first 2 or 3 days this started. Every once in a while, I'll get a twinge of muscle twitching.\u00a0\u00a0Never had that before.\u00a0\u00a0That also is not painful.\u00a0\u00a0Just a sporadic twitching every once in a while. The doctor sent me for bloodwork and an MRI of the head.\u00a0\u00a0Both came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor seems to think it's a post viral infection.\u00a0\u00a0I wasn't sick at the time I started getting this. I'm very concerned that there is something seriously wrong.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor\u00a0\u00a0doesn't think it's anything serious. The doctor thinks it can also be stress. I do tend to be an overly anxious person.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm VERY SCARED that this is MS.\u00a0\u00a0My questions are:1.\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound like it could be MS?2.\u00a0\u00a0Could it be related to the accident and the pain in my back?3.\u00a0\u00a0Could it be post viral infection even if I wasn't sick?4.\u00a0\u00a0Can it be stress related?5.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions on what it can be?6.\u00a0\u00a0Do you think I should see a neurologist?Thank you again for your help.\u00a0\u00a0It is greatly appreciated.Stephanie",
