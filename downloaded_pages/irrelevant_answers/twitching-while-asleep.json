            "answer": "Hello,Two possibilities are there.It can be hypnogogic myoclonic seizures. Twitches while falling asleep are called hypnagogic myoclonus, myoclonus being any sort of involuntary muscle spasm and hypnagogic referring to sleep. It's not known exactly what causes the twitches, but they appear to be associated with anxiety and faint stimulus like noise.Secondly,it can be restless leg syndrome. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a disorder of the part of the nervous system that affects movements of the legs. Because it usually interferes with sleep, it also is considered a sleep disorder.Sometimes restless leg syndrome can be caused by diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, Cigarette smoking, magnesium or Vit B12 deficiency.Polysomnography (sleep testing) may be necessary to diagnose the sleep disturbances and determine if you have periodic limb movementsTry avoiding day time naps and pls don\u2019t take any caffeine before bedtime. Try to sleep in a room where there is little noise and pls don\u2019t feel stressful and anxious regarding every day\u2019s worries just before bedtime. You can try meditation for stress and if the condition does not improve then you can take some mild sedatives.Hope it helps.Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "RLS movements are generally random - the legs get uncomfortable so we are compelled to move them. Periodic Limb Movment Disorder (PLMD) is to be considered when the movements are rythmic or repetitive. Generally when a movement starts to repeat they will be the same movements at regularly timed intervals until they cause arousal. Then they start over, and how they manifest can change based on position.",
