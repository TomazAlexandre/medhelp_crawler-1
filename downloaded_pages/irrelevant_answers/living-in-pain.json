            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Your symptoms are due to the regular migraines that you are having. It is important to break the cycle of migraines. What medications are you currently taking and have you been able to identify a trigger?Medications like Topamax help to break the migraine cycle. Magnesium supplements also play a preventive role. Complete avoidance of trigger is another treatment. I would also suggest you take B12 supplements also as you may be suffering from peripheral neuropathy.Take care!",

            "answer": "Hi,Peripheral neuropathy is nerve damage which can occur either as a result of nutritional deficiency like B12 deficiency or due to diabetes. Trauma to the nerves can also cause neuropathy. Your symptoms of burning sensation can be due to peripheral neuropathy. How ever it is also important to rule out causes like thyroid dysfunction.Hope this helps!",

    "question": "I have been to several doctors, none of them are sure what is wrong with me. My symptoms, I have migraines a least five days out of the week, I am constantly dizzy and feel faint, I am always tired I have a hard time falling asleep and staying asleep, I have a hard time comprehending when people a talking, and recently it feels as if my whole body is one big bruise. It hurts to move, I wanted to put my hair up the other day because I was hot and it hurt to move my hair! I was also given a hug and I thought I was going to die because of the pain it put me in! I have tried taking pain medication and nothing seems to be helping. I can't live like this, Im in SO much pain, and I need some sort of help even if it\u2019s a pill that will ease the pain so I can go to work. Thank You!!!",
