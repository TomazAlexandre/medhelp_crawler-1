            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, it is possible to get shingles without rash but severe pain.\u00a0\u00a0If the antivirals are not helping, MRI of the spine should be done for the affected region. Other possibilities are peripheral neuropathies due to diabetes and thyroid disorders. Nerve conduction studies should also be done.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. Hope this helps. Take care!",
