            "answer": "I had that problem for a while and had to adjust my meds. If Dr won't listen and ur taking ur \"book\" in so he can see n check them, I'd look for another Dr. I've also learned different drs have different target numbers they want u at. For me its fasting 70-90, n 90-120 2hrs after eating. When I was having problems keeping mine up Dr had me get diabetic sugar tabs to carry with me. I was also dealing with hg (severe morning sickness) and that can lower ur levels too. Good luck",

    "question": "Hi all. I had diabetes before getting pregnant. My Doctor adjusted my medication a few times and had me monitor it 4 times a day. He wouldnt listen to my concerns, but I listened anyways because he's the specialist. Lo and behold, my sugar level dropped to 44 last night. After having a bunch of sugar, I raised it to 80, and it fell to 57 shortly after. Any advice? I don't want to see him again.",
