    "question": "This is an important notice:When you check your blood sugar, make sure that your hands are clean, if your hands are dirty the reading can be COMPLETELY WRONG!Here are a number of advices for coping with diabetes:1) find a friend that has diabetes - it is a million dollar difference when you can discuss it with a friend. (preferably in person, but email or phone is also ok)2) Try to make it as convenient as possible - here are a few ways:-Get a fast glucose tester.-Get insulin pens. (they are extremely convenient, now that i have them, i don't know how i managed before!)-Talk to your endocrinologist about LANTUS, it is a thousand times more convenient than regular HUMILIN.3) Always remember that whether your day turns out good or bad is all based on YOUR MIND, if you keep yourself in the right frame of mind, by opening your eyes that in reality, diabetes is NOT a terrible problem, you will feel great. I know people that faught in Vietnam, they lost hands and feet, they suffered misrably for years and years, and they had to take not just one- but tons of different medications, and these people were always happy, because although they had all those problems, they were very religious, and they would always say that they accepted what god gave them. FOR SURE ANYONE WHO HAS DIABETES SHOULD ALWAYS BE HAPPY.if you has any comments please post.",
