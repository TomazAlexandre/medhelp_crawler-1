            "answer": "Your HBsAg is < 1000 iu/ml and your hbvdna is < 20 iu/ml. Current research literature indicates:1. You are likely to be a good candidate for stopping medication. Please note, stopping rules for taking antivirals are not well defined, but seems to require a low HBsAg2. You are likely to be a good candidate for adding PegINFN to your treatment in order to clear HBsAg.All of these are experimental and no yet in standard guidelines. I am sure stef2012 will inform you further, especially about Alinia.I don't know how diabetes will affect the outcome. There is some research coming out that indicates Metformin (Diabex) may protect against liver cancer.Just my opinion.",

            "answer": "The reasoning works like this:The immune system is exhausted from constantly fighting the virus. A period of undetectable hbvdna brings peace and seems to allow parts of the immune system to recover and refresh.. At this time, if we then add Interferon, which stimulates the immune system,\u00a0\u00a0this together with a refreshed immune system, may be able to overcome the virus. Furthermore, if serum HBsAg level is low, its inhibition of the immune system will be lessened, making it even easier for the immune system to clear and control the virus.Just my over simplified views of things.",
