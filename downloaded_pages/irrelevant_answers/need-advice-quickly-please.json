            "answer": "Actually this is a neurological, rather than a diabetic issue. At this point the answer is \"watchful waiting\". I would be optimistic, but there are not always favorable outcomes. A glucose level of 120 is not hypoglycemic. There may be other issues involved. Perhaps a stroke. Generally it takes at least three months before an evaluation should be made. This is subject to argument. In the case of my late mother, physicians pronounced her brain-dead and she could communicate quite well by squeezing my hand once or twice to answer questions \"yes\" or \"no\". As to whether there is hope for recovery, \"maybe yes\" and \"maybe no\". You have a rough decision, but I would not be pressured into rushing it.",

    "question": "My brother, who is a 60 year old type 2 diabetic, was found unconscious this week. Nobody knows for how long. Best guess is 8 hrs. My guess is that he is in a hypoglycemic coma. His glucose level was 120 when he was halo flown to the hospital he is at now. I don't know what he was given at the other hospital to raise that number but I believe it was much lower when he was found. I need to know if this is a survivable event. His doctor asked me today if there were a medical emergency with him would I want him to be put on life support. I don't know!! Yes if he had even the slimmest chance of coming out of this coma state he is in. He moves around on his bed, eyes open but not following anything. I thought a coma was pretty much no movement. But if he had to be on life support indefinitely and would never recover from the state he is in now, I think he would rather I let him go. Can anybody tell me what his chances are for recovery?",
