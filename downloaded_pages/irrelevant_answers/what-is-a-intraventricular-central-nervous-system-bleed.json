            "answer": "Hi,Intraventricular CNS bleed is the bleeding inside or around the ventricles(spaces in the brain containing the CSF)It is not clear why IVH occurs. It occurs mostly in premature babies. Bleeding may occur because blood vessels in a premature baby's brain are very fragile and immature and\u00a0\u00a0rupture easily. Babies with respiratory diseases such as hyaline membrane disease, or other complications of prematurity, are more likely to have IVH. Even a full term baby or child may have IVH if the blood vessels are fragile. Just as there is no specific cause of IVH, there is no specific treatment also. Any medical conditions that may be considered to cause IVH may be treated and risk factors like diabetes and high blood pressure should be kept under control. Hope this helps you. Take care and regards!",
