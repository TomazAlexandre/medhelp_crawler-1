    "question": "I am currently getting over a case of pneumonia that took me out for about a month. My question is, and I'm not sure it is related to being sick, but I have strong electrical like vibrations that move through my body when i bend my neck or bend over now. It is quite uncomfortable and I feel it from my head, to my hands, mid-section, and down to my knees. I'm a little worried and am wondering what is going on.",
