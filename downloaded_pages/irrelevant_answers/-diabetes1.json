            "answer": "Im pre-diabetic.Type 2 of course. When I found out I was pregnant I immediatly quit taling my Metformin. I now only consume 170 carbs a day. 45 at each meal and 15 for each snack. So I eat roughly 5 times a day. I don't eat super late at night. I do cheat but its usually like that I combine my snack and take a walk around the block. It's much easier said then done though. At first I had to look at lables and write every thing out in a food diary to keep track. Now if my meal is 45 carbs or less then I don't even worry about it. Also something that helped me was getting my family on board. Make your hubby eat what you eat. He needs more carbs so his portions are bigger. I have a very picky daughter so we gove her Ensure. And she loves it. Just trying to keep my whole family healthy. What motivated me to do this was so many women have large babies with gestational diabetes. And I'm a whip. I want a healthy smaller baby. Is that wrong of me?",
