            "answer": "I shouldn't be surprised anymore to hear that doctors inform patients they are prediabetic and don't tell them anything about what that means or what to do about it. Unfortunately, this is very common and so what you need to do is educate yourself and become proactive in your own care. Anyway, I suggest viewing a diagnosis of prediabetes as an opportunity to make some changes that can significantly slow down the progression of diabetes. First of all what is important is to know your numbers. What did the doctor use to diagnose your prediabetes. Fasting blood sugar? A1C. If it is the first, then anything from 100 to 125 is prediabetes and 126 and over is diabetes. If it is A1C, then 5.7 to 6.4 is pre and 6.5 and over is diabetes. That will tell you where you stand.The things that will slow the progression of your diabetes are: losing and maintaining a healthy weight, cutting carb intake and regular exercise. Everyone knows about cutting out sugar but sugar is only one form of carb (the simplest, and thus the worst). Other foods high in carbs are potatoes, rice, pasta, cereal and bread. All diabetics are different so the best way to know what to eat is to buy a blood meter and test your blood sugar two hours after a meal. You want to be under 140 at that time. If a certain food puts you up higher than that, then you want to cut the portion or eliminate that food. Test more frequently until you get to know what you can and can't eat.If you want to learn from many more people with prediabetes and diabetes, send me a private message and I will send you a couple websites.Diabetes is a manageable disorder but there is a lot to learn at first so don't be overwhelmed.",

            "answer": "Zoelula provided excellent advice.The meters are very inexpensive with rebates. Wal-mart has the best buys.Bear in mind that many things are not known about diabetes, and it can have varying etiologies.\u00a0\u00a0There are factors, and probably a genetic componant. All diabetics are different.The thing is that \"carbohydrate cravings\" go hand and hand with the disease.It takes a lot of will power to control eating.And social life (in the United States at least) often revolves around \"the meal\".Regular exercise is also necessary.An \"exercising\" hobby such as swimming (especially), hiking or riding a bicycle will be very helpful.",

            "answer": "Thank you both for your prompt reply...........I have been working myself into quite \"the state!\"My doctor used a fasting glucose for her dx. (Should I ask her for an A1C? Doesn't that give you a longer range idea of your numbers?)I keep all my medical records, but don't you know the ONE I can't find is this report! I do remember that the number was in the 120's.Does being prediabetic mean that I will, inevitably, become diabetic or is it possible to reverse this course I'm on?The only experience I've had dealing with diabetes was my dog. And I was TOTALLY overwhelmed trying to get his insulin dose correct.Is there a particular meter you'd recommend?Again, I thank you both for your advice and I hope I won't become a nuisance with all my questions!Gratefully,Linda",

            "answer": "Hi LindaThere are no guarantees about progressing to diabetes, but the key is to go as long as possible controlling your diabetes with diet and exercise. An A1C is now considered the standard of diagnosis, but you can get one down the road. I wouldn't worry about insulin right now, unless your numbers start to rise. The meters don't differ that much; the expense is from the test strips, not the meter. If your insurance covers it than you want to get say an Accuchek Aviva or One Touch. If not, then you will do fine with Walmart Brand which is the most economical for strips. Don't worry about questions, glad to help. But the websites will expose you to people with a very varied experience as all diabetics are different",

    "question": "Hello there...............I just received my bloodwork from my doctor and my glucose level was apparently high. She wrote that I was \"prediabetic,\" but that was all. It kind of scared me and I wish she would have advised me to consult with her or given me a list of reading material to understand what I need to do.So I am turning to you folks who understand this disorder for counsel and advice. I welcome your knowledge, experience.Linda",
