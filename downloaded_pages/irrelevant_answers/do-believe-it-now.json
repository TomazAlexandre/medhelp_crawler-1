    "question": "I now believe it when I hear to run when you hear some Doctors spouting what they take as facts about treating Hypothyroidism.Yesterday I saw an Endocrinologist, more or less for an opinion because of the barely normal Vitamin D, barely normal FT3, barely normal Glucose, an A1c that is 50% of the way to being PreDiabetes, etc.He factually told me that the guidelines say it isn't acceptable to treat Hypo by symptoms and that the TSH doesn't support being on medication for it.\u00a0\u00a0He flat out said that the suppressed TSH from the Armour means it says I have too much in my system.\u00a0\u00a0Oh come on!\u00a0\u00a0He factually told me that if changes occur about the \"norm\" to the European standard for VitD, then I'm fine in the low 30s.\u00a0\u00a0Didn't pay attention at all about how having Fibromyalgia uses up the VitD more than others do and quickly.\u00a0\u00a0He factually told me to do South Beach Diet again and for a longer time on Phase 1 to control the blood sugars, despite my telling him I have within the past few months with no result at all.As I said...this was a run do NOT walk scenario.",
