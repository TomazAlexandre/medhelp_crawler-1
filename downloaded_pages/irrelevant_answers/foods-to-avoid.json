            "answer": "Not everyone can tolerate medicine/drugs alike. Glucophage, or commonly known as Metformin, MUST be taken with foods or one will experience nausea/upset stomach. If irritation continues discuss with your doctor these other medications as I'm not aware of what is available to you in your country of residence. http://www.*************.com/diabetes/find-drug.html\"Please advise me what foods to avoid.... eat alot of bread and rice.\"I've said this before in other posts and I'll pass it on to you as well; Besides watching sugar in your diet-- you also need to watch carbohydrates (starches) carefully too. For example, things like breads, potatoes, pasta, crackers, etc. can cause a drastic rise in your blood sugar if you aren't careful. (They are converted to sugar after you eat them.)Other foods/drinks need care too (example; milk, fruit, fruit juice) can also cause blood sugar to rise (so serving sizes and moderation are important). With fruit it\u2019s important to eat them with other foods to slow the absorption of fructose (fruit sugar). I'm NOT saying that these foods aren't allowed. What I AM saying is that you need to use care and follow the guidelines for diabetics. Google \"diabetes nutrition\" and \"glycemic index\" for recommendations.If you have an Endocrinologist, a diabetes doctor, or a diabetes nurse, or a nutritionist they can help you a lot with nutritional guidelines. (Serving sizes, and how many servings of each type food that's safe for you.)",
