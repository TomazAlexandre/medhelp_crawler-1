            "answer": "Deven,I have had friends suggest to me that I have bypass surgery due to my continuing clogging of the arteries, Having had six cardiac caths and as many stents. I would prefer to have another 20 caths and stents before I'd consider a CABG. Bypass surgery is \"major\" surgery with many more risks and potential complications than caths. My brother had a CABG when he was 40. He was in miserable pain for quite some time afterwards, He recently, at 52, had 4 stents placed. Trust me, he prefers the stents. The pain associated with a CABG is severe.My cardiologists have informed me that they could place several more stents in me should the need arise. I hope you take the advice of your dad's cardiologists if they suggest stenting is the way to go, Recovery time is a couple of days with minimal pain.I should have mentioned, the stents I had placed were for different blockages. I have had no issues with any stents placed.As I've been told several times, if there is ever an issue during a cath, they can proceed to a CABG rather quickly.\u00a0\u00a0As I told my friends, if you prefer bypass surgery, than you go have it done, I'm cool with stenting. Cardiologists should make that determination not you, your dad or anyone else.I hope all turns out well for you and dad!",
