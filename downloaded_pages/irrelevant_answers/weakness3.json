            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Erectile dysfunction can occur in all men at one time or the other. It is more common with advancing age. Emotional problems like anger, depression, stress, anxiety could be the causes.But you mentioned that you are experiencing weakness, this could inturn cause ED. Diseases which\u00a0\u00a0can cause weakness and there by ED\u00a0\u00a0are diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, conditions where level of testosterone is reduced, conditions in which blood supply is inadequate to the penis and in treatment for depression.Alcohol and smoking can influence erectile function.I would suggest that you get a work up done for diabetes and hypertension. Also get a check of the level of testosterone and take the opinion of a urologist.All the best.",

            "answer": "I don't know how to post on here so I guess people will answer here, I've been having this issue for the past year (I'm 15)II started masturbating at age 10 and then eventually started masturbating up to 6 times a day, each time I could easily control my orgasm and last up to 40 minutes and it always felt good and I had thick white ***,eventually I was able to fully ejaculate around age 13 and I produced a lot of ***, but until age 14 it got weird, I couldn't and still can't control it anymore and I *** before I've had enough stimulation and am ready, normally I could just do it for so long until it would explosively throb and I'd *** everywhere now when I *** it barely throbs and a small amount of liquidy grey *** would just run down the side and the orgasm *****, I still have a high libido and I want to continue masturbation however I can't get those powerful potent erections I used to just spontaneously get even though it still gets hard it just isn't throbby and I can't have the epic build up I used to be able to do and my refractory period is like 24 hours, I noticed a correlation between having loose or tight balls though, every time they're loose it works a lot better, however when they're tight my penis just feels weak and it feels like my **** and balls don't have room to throb without ejaculation, normally I would do it until it started to throb then I would stop and keep going, however many throbs I had before I just couldn't take it any more would determine my orgasm, except now I *** on the first\u00a0\u00a0throb and I can just feel the weakness in my balls no matter how turned on I am, another thing I want to add is there's a girl I really like and when she barely touches me I get a throbbing rock hard erection, I tried quitting for 2 weeks up until yesterday with loose balls and it worked exactly how it used to lasted like a half hour, powerful ejaculation thick white *** and the throbbing was the same as it used to but then I tried again the next morning borderline tight balls and it was the most pathetic orgasm with barely any *** after only 10-15 minutes and it didn't feel that good during the build up, is it possible that my refractory period is 2 weeks? Please help I keep re trying and it just is so mild and I'm having strong sexual erges at the same time what the hell",

    "question": "I'm in my early 30s.\u00a0\u00a0Lately I've been experiencing weak erections and low semen production.\u00a0\u00a0While having sex my penis may become less erect and then regain its full erection.\u00a0\u00a0When ejaculating a very low amount of semen is coming out and sometimes none at all. I am worried about my situation and wonder why it started happening in the past few months.I''ve been under some stress lately, lost a lot of weight was 155lb now 130.\u00a0\u00a0I have a healthy life style and no STDs.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing is I'm running low on energy and have no idea why.\u00a0\u00a0While at the gym I have to reduce amount of reps. compared to before because of the lack of energy.Could all this be a part of my \"weakness\" problem and what can be done?Thank you.",
