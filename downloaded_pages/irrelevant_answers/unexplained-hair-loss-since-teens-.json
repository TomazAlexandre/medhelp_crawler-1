            "answer": "Hi,Hair loss could be due to stress, hormonal problems, certain medications, infection, or as part of underlying disease such as diabetes and lupus.\u00a0\u00a0 If your thyroid gland is\u00a0\u00a0not functioning well, hair may fall out.\u00a0\u00a0Hair loss may also occur if male or female hormones are out of balance.\u00a0\u00a0If it is hormone-related, correcting the hormone imbalance may stop your hair loss. Some medications such as anticoagulants, gout medicines, chemotherapy, vitamin A, birth control pills and antidepressants may also cause hair loss.It is best that you have this evaluated for proper diagnosis and management. Treatment usually depends on the underlying cause. Take care and keep us posted.",

            "answer": "I don't think I lead a very stressful life. There are times when it gets stressful but I try to keep things in balance.\u00a0\u00a0I certainly did not have a stressful life when the\u00a0\u00a0hair loss initially began. I was only 13 or 14. I considered the possibility of a thyriod problem but after checking it out with my d octor everything seems fine. I am not on any long term medications now or during the last few years when I have had this thinning hair. Diabetes does run in my family and I considered the possibility that I may have insulin resistance. I have monitored my blood sugar and it is normal. I have consulted several dermatologists who suggested rogaine for women( which did not work at all for me) or vitamins( I take regular one a day for women and have tried various other supplements in the past). I have had several blood tests done which revealed nothing abnormal. I have no other health problems that I am aware of. Are there any specific tests that I should ask my PCP to look into?",

            "answer": "Have you considered being tested for graves disease, lupus or hoshiomotos disease? I have also been losing my hair since my early twenties. I have been tested for all above and eventually told it was genetic. Every one in my family also has thick hair.i tried Rogaine as well and it had side affects such as facial hair that I really didn't want to deal with. I am in my fourties now and you can see my scalp. The thinning has lead to depression.",

    "question": "I am a 25 year old woman who has been suffering from hair loss since my teens. I have tried natural remedies, supplements, topical creams and so on but nothing has ever worked. My doctors have all come up with the explanation that it might be genetic( although everyone in my family has thick hair even when they are in their 70s). Has anyone encountered a similar situation? It is an overall thinning in the front of the head, so bad now that you can see my scalp through the practically translucent layer in the very front. I am considering hair transplants or wigs ? Does anyone have any suggestions about either? Any information about your own experiences with this situation, either about the causes of hair loss or managing it, would be appreciated. Thank You.",
