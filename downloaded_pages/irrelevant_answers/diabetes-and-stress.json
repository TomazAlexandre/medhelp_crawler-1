            "answer": "I have a diabetic sister who seems to have failry constant allergy problems. Fatigue is one of the symptoms she notices when allergies act up. Also, her blood sugar levels rise when allergies are being triggered. I would agree that this may be the cause of her symptoms. The trick is going to be figuring out what causes any allergies, if allergies are indeed the problem. In m y sister's case. taking some allergy meds that lower the histamines seem to help with the fatigue and high blood sugars, too. Please suggest that she talk to her doctor about this, for any allergies should be noted in her medical records for the future. Allergy tests are fairly simple and can identify precisely what the triggers are.",

            "answer": "Because you have seen this happen twice in 3 months, I would encourage you to have your GF talk to her endocrinologist about it soon.\u00a0\u00a0It's good that you remember what seems to have happened, but I'd also suggest writing this stuff down to share with her doctor.I'm not a physician, but from what I've experienced as an adult and a diabetic I wonder about allergies.\u00a0\u00a0It could be to food, to products you or she is using, to something with her insulin or pump, insects or other things in her/your house, etc. etc..\u00a0\u00a0What kinds of things were you & she doing on the day before each outbreak?\u00a0\u00a0Any new soap?Yeast infections are more likely with blood sugars that aren't well controlled becasue the yeast bacteria LOVES the too-sweet environment that's also so dangerous for us diabetics.Check back -- others may have additional ideas and suggestions.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure you'll hear a theme tho ... encourage her to discuss this soon with her doc.Good for you for caring enough to find this site & check into things on her behalf.\u00a0\u00a0While this disease is hers to manage, it is wonderful to have supportive family & friends helping us along the way.",

            "answer": "jomaque~ sorry for the delay in responding to you . . . holiday travels! You have many questions here and hopefully I can offer you some info and I'm sure others will chime in and offer you additional information.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if her symptoms are stress related or not, they sound more like allergic reactions to something.\u00a0\u00a0Given that they appear on her face, they could be a reaction to cosmetics or cleansers . . . I have had that happen before myself and it can be both painful and annoying.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest she try to problem solve herself by replacing any old cosmetics and cleansers and see if that helps.\u00a0\u00a0Or if she's recently changed brands of an item, eliminate that one for a while and see if the problem goes away.\u00a0\u00a0Now to the yeast infection.\u00a0\u00a0This can be a result of elevated blood sugars which could be happening from her body's reaction to the allergic reaction.\u00a0\u00a0They may all be connected that way.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest she check with her doctor, hopefully she sees an endocrinologist, who can help her get to the bottom of this situation.\u00a0\u00a0Please let us know how things proceed and return to the forum to see if others post comments to your question.",

            "answer": "I checked with my allergy-prone sis about the swollen lip, and she told me that this is a very common symptom of food allergy. A friend of hers gets a puffy lower lip every time she eats shellfish. If it happens again, perhaps your girlfriend should examine what she ate before the symptoms appeared.",
