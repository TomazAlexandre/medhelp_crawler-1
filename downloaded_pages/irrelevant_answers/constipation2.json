            "answer": "The diagnosis is probably IBS with constipation.\u00a0\u00a0And, I do agree with gymdandee about the bulk forming fiber.\u00a0\u00a0Although, I personally can't use psyllium.\u00a0\u00a0Doesn't matter, because it's still a good idea and is a very good solution for many people.\u00a0\u00a0It's far safer than using laxatives and most people need more fiber.\u00a0\u00a0People with IBS-C usually need to give this kind of thing a try.\u00a0\u00a0There are other fibers out there, but this is definitely a good place to start.Just be sure to drink extra water or it won't help and may give you more cramps.\u00a0\u00a0Drinking plenty of water usually takes care of the problem, so no worries.\u00a0\u00a0Definitely get which ever brand of psyllium fiber that is just the psyllium without additives.\u00a0\u00a0Metamucil is actually psyllium but it's full of additives and these additives are a serious problem for many people.\u00a0\u00a0So, read the labels in case you can't find the brand name mentioned above in your area.Often dietary changes are needed, like going gluten and dairy free.\u00a0\u00a0These things tend to cause more cramping and constipation for a lot of people with IBS-C.\u00a0\u00a0The psyllium fiber should definitely help with appetite control, and naturally, since fiber helps make you feel full.I do agree with the type of doctor recommended, too.\u00a0\u00a0Second best is a gastroenterologist, but the colon/rectal doctor specializes in the lower colon region.",
