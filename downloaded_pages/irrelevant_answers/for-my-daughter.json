            "answer": "Its not diabetes which causes weight gain, it's weight gain which causes diabetes. Her first step is to lose the weight, make lifestyle changes with her eating habits, and start performing 30 minutes of physical exercise daily. A huge number of people have been able to reverse their diabetic condition back to normal just with weight loss. Read other threads on this forum as nutritional advice and weight loss has been discussed a number of times - what to eat, what to avoid.Onto her current doctor, dump him/her. Testing for diabetes has been part of the normal annual health check-up for the past ten years. To be shocked indicates someone is w-a-y out of touch with reality and truly raises a red flag.As far as her unusual body odor, diabetes and people with urinary tract infections will sometimes produce a different kind of body odor. If it is a sweet smelling, almost fruity body odor she has excess keytones [when the body burns fat instead of sugar for energy]. If she is on insulin, the insulin can also create an acetone like smell. Neither is good to have but both are treatable. She should be analyzed by a specialist, an Endocrinologist, a doctor who trained and specializes in diabetes.",

            "answer": "For your reference, the definition of \"causes\" by Merriam-Webster:a : a reason for an action or conditionb : something that brings about an effect or a resultc : a person or thing that is the occasion of an action or state; especially : an agent that brings something aboutd : sufficient reasonNow, if you combined 'contributing causes' you would get \"Condition or event that increases the frequency or severity of a problem.\", which is akin to 'a' and 'b' above. Bottom line you can use either cause or contribute as a verb to state the resulting consequences.Additionally, where in the world did you get diabetes causes weight gain? If not properly treated diabetes causes unexplained weight loss. Furthermore, surely you cannot suggest that it is solely an autoimmune disease as there are hundreds of thousands who are medicinally induced t2'ers, and hundreds of thousands other peeps with Endocrine disorders - pituitary, thyroid, kidneys and pancreas which caused their t2. Fact is, if one is overweight with a BMI over 30 then are diagnosed t2 chances are very high their diabetes was caused by weight issues.Truth be known medical science does know t2 diabetes can be caused by genetics, or from being overweight, or from side effects of medication, or from an Endocrine disorder. Yes, these are all contributing factors that cause diabetes. Try speaking first hand with Endocrinologists for research, I do.",

    "question": "Although I have personally posted (and read) my way through various forums here; my daughter, who is 30 years old was just informed that she has type II diabetes. Since the condition does not exist in either side of the families, I can only assume that it is due to her current weight. She has gained a ridiculous amount of weight, especially in the past 8 months. Did this create her diabetes or can diabetes create such a weight gain? While I wanted her to request to be tested long ago - her Doctor thought it unnecessary and behaved as though she was shocked that Aubree was type II at all. Go figure.One other thing I noticed this a.m. that I have never encountered around my daughter before ... she smelled badly. Not a dirty smell, as though she needed a bath, no. Something I couldn't quite put my finger on. It was an odor that had me gagging. It's not my imagination but has anyone heard of such a thing associated with diabetes or it must be something else entirely??",
