            "answer": "Hi,It would be best to see a doctor to discuss all your symptoms. You made a mention of \u201cthought I was having a heart attack\u201d and this may or may not be related (could there be some psychological dimension to your problem?) .Gynecomastia may indeed be related with obesity. Erectile function is largely dependent on blood vessels (hence problems such as diabetes which damages blood vessels may make erectile function less, cholesterol may also be contributory as well as smoking).If there is usually an erection early in the morning, then this means that the blood vessels are intact. Chances are, there are hormonal imbalances (this again may be a function of obesity). That you have normal hormonal tests is a good thing. Tests however, may not be able to detect fluctuations as hormones are generally pulsatile not sustained over a period of time. Fluctuations in hormone levels may be responsible for the pattern of having erectile dysfunction (even sleep deprivation, or shifting work schedules may alter hormones).The simplest course of action may be to continue weight reduction, adequate exercise and adequate sleep, keep yourself smoke free, and try not to become frustrated if an episode of dysfunction arises.",

    "question": "This whole thing started when I thought I was having a heart attack. I went to the doctor and then all of this started. I am a 25 year old male 280lbs and I used to smoke cigarettes and marijuana. I started having erection problems about 4 years ago. It was once in a while not all the time. Now it is still the same situation. I can masturbate with no problem I get erections when I am asleep I dont know how often but my girlfriend and i checked a couple of times I get morning wood sometimes but not always like before. I take viagra sometimes. I had and ekg and I took a basic blood test to check for diabetes, heart, thyroid and kidneys. Everything was good except my bad cholestorol was a little high. Since then I quit smoking completely and lost a little weight my blood pressure also improved and also my erections alittle. I have been recently been diagnosed with an enlarged breast bud or possible gynecomastia pending a hormone test that is only on the left side. I took a blood test and I am waiting for the results. It is testing my random testosterone, cortisol, estradiol, dhea levels and my hepatic profile. I have no problems with my testicles no lump, pain, swelling, heavy feeling nothing, except above my left testicle the vein is more pronounced.Kind of feels like a \"bag of worms\". My penis is at least average size and my testicles are also at least average size and normal equal consistency. My pubic hair is full and has not decreased at all. I am not infertile as I have gotten my girlfriend pregnant twice. I have male pattern baldness that started when I was about 23 and have alot of body and facial hair. My uncle had thyroid problems when he was younger. Recently my thyroid gland in my neck was alittle swollen (not visibly noticable)\u00a0\u00a0feels abit weird when I swallow and I have back and neck pain. I don't have any vision problems or headaches, but I feel weird like I'm lost or something. I catch myself staring into nothing alot. I have a sedentary job using computers. I have no signs or symptoms suggesting cancer or anything else that is major.My question is this what is causing these symptoms?Could they just be because I used smoke and I am overweight?I read because I also have had problems with ed there could be an underlying problem related to the gynecomastiaWhat is the worst case scenario if my hormones are messed up?If my hormones are messed up is it possible to cure or does it usually become a lifetime fix?Can my ed be fixed?",
