            "answer": "Sure. Of course. But please, don't try and loose weight, it is really bad for the baby. Just eat like you usually do plus a few hundred more calories a day. Eat low fat yogurts and milks, and excercise for 30 minutes a day. Were you over or under weight before you get prego? I have read if your were overweight you should gain between 15 and 24 lbs during the pregnancy and if you were underweight you should gain between 26 and 40 lbs. I gained 40 with my first!

            "answer": "Ditto, congratulations on finding the willpower to do this for your little one!\u00a0\u00a0The main thing, besides exercise, that you can do to watch out for too much weight gain is to cut out foods with a lot of sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Sugared soda (i.e., not diet soda) is my favorite when I'm not preggo, but boy, a 12-ounce can of it can have 12 teaspoons of sugar!\u00a0\u00a0I'm watching this not so much because of concerns about weight, but because I don't want to give myself gestational diabetes, but I think it has also been the reason I've only gained about 3 or 4 lbs by week 12.\u00a0\u00a0Take care!",

            "answer": "I agree with you. I think sometimes people confuse eating healthy with trying to diet, but really if youre eating small meals all day long that are healthy this is not really dieting. You would have to be cutting your portions down and the frequecy of meals for it to be considered dieting in my opinion. I didnt know that weight watchers had a pregnancy diet. My co-worker started weight watchers a few weeks ago and is doing great on it. I am going to look into the pregnancy diet thing with them I think. In the meantime I have quit eating anything fried. Sounds like you will be fine too, as long as you are eating healthy and staying away from a lot of refined sugar and fried foods. Good luck!",

    "question": "Ok my post to my own last question made me think of another one. I am in the 11th week and have already gained 10 lbs. I also was a smoker for 8 years prior to becoming pregnant and quit cold-turkey when I found out. I haven't been eating massive amounts of food or anything, but I certainly haven't been dieting either! I know by seeing my friends quit that some of them really packed on the pounds, as this is one of the side-effects of quitting smoking. I am wondering if some of my weight gain could be attributed to quitting smoking?",
