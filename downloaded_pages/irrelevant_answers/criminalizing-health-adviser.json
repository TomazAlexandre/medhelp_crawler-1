            "answer": "As usual you have picked up the post and gave your frank opinion. When I re-read my post, I found a gross mistake. The News are from North Carolina and not from north Arizona.By chance I was reading a novel entitled 'Mid-wife'. The novel is on Russian Jewish people who come to New York and they undergo all the hassle of license for the mid wife who is more expert than a qualified Obstetrician.Quite an interesting novel.And a coincidental with the N Carolina News.",

            "answer": "Just don't know why anyone who took the time to get the education would balk at the idea of getting a license.If someone refuses to get a license in a field where everyone else has had to in order to work in that profession, why is it fair for someone not to?I guess I really don't get that.However, that is different than a blogger who gives his own account of how he helped his medical situation through diet for others to learn from.\u00a0\u00a0If he is promoting himself as a dietician/nutritionist without the qualifications, that is another story as that is fraud.Anyway, I am thinking all agree on this subject.",
