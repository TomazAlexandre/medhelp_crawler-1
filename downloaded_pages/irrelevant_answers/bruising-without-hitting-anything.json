            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!One possibility is that when he fell, he did not notice the bruise in other areas. They came up subsequently. The other possible reasons are low platelet count, clotting disorders, fragile spider veins, deep vein thrombus, deficiency of Vitamin B12, folic acid, or Vit K, a liver disease or certain cancers. It could also be due to pressure urticaria. If your father is on blood thinners like aspirin or anticoagulants, then this could also be a reason.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor and get your father investigated. Hope this helps. Take care!",
