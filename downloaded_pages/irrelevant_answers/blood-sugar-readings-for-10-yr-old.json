            "answer": "The number of 243 and 156 after a meal do both seem high, but his body may have been successful in lowering the numbers after another hour or so. Lab testing is the best way to find out if he has a problem. Is your son's weight normal or is he overweight? If overweight, then I would discuss with his doctor putting him on a diet. He may be a candidate for type 2 diabetes if his weight is higher than it should be, for this is a growing problem in children. If he is not overweight, you might want to ask the doctor to check for the antibodies that show if his immune system is currently attacking his pancreas. That test and his blood glucose test together would show if type 1 diabetes may be happening.But don't panic. Do have him checked and see what real lab tests show. It is possible that a carb-heavy Thanksgiving meal was the culprit and that he just didn't react as healthily as his siblings did. He may be a youngster that should watch his diet more than his siblings as far as eating large amounts of carbs.",

    "question": "Hi. Just wanted to ask a question about random blood sugar readings. We were at my parent's house Thanksgiving and my step-father is a non-insulin dependant diabetic. My kids were interested in how he does fingersticks to check his BS, so he let each of them check theirs for their own curiosity. This was right after eacting, including deserts and all. Of the three children the results were 141, 108, and 243. The 243 was my 10 yr old son. We re-checked his after about 1 1/2- 2 hrs and his reading was 156. He has shown no other signs or symptoms. I plan to have him checked by his pediatrician as soon as possible, but just wanted some feedback until then. Thanks.",
