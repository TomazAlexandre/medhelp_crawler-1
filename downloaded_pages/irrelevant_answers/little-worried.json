            "answer": "What you shoukd do when you get to your dr ask questions. Because you do have type 2 diabetes make sure you monitor your sugar intake because if its a bit high it can cause your baby to slow done in fetal movement. But otherwise thats what they do. One day there moving like they doing martial arts and then theres days when they are chilling but its always good to get a couple of\u00a0\u00a0movements a day. You should be fine if your feeling fine and your sugar level is ok.\u00a0\u00a0God bless!",

    "question": "Hi February mommies, I have a question for you. I am due February 3rd and I had a Dr's appt Thursday, November 6 th and my baby girl's heart rate was 158. But I am a little worried because she is not moving much. I am a type 2 diabetic and my sugar levels are not stable. Is anyone else's baby being more lazy than active? I go back to the Dr on Wednesday, November 12th for an ultrasound. My husband says she is fine and I am worried for nothing but what do you think?",
