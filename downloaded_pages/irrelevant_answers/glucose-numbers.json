            "answer": "I am currently not on any meds. For the low carb meal I had scrambled eggs (plain, with no salt or other seasonings) and 1 cup of coffee with Sweet-n-low and non-dairy creamer. I have had hypoglycemia most of my life starting when I was a child. I have been loosing some weight lately, and drinking lots of water. I did have kidney stones not too long ago and since then the hypos have been more frequent. I did have a number of different blood tests, my A1c was 5.5 but my doctor believes this is because of the many lows I have been having.Type 1 runs in my family, my mother's brother died from complications due to type 1 as did her father. I am 41 so this can't be the onset of type 1 or could it? I have also had a CT scan to rule out an Insulinoma, I am still waiting on the C-Peptide results as well as the GAD. Oh, I am 5'8 and weigh 160 pounds and still loosing more. Last night I used one of my son's Ketostix and it the results of that showed that I am spilling large ketones in my urine. I have been using a glucose meter that I was prescribed and there are days where my glucose have been what I consider to be normal, then there are days where I will run low an hour after meals or in the middle of the night.",

I need to make him something to eat when he's like that, cause he doesn't have the strength.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Losing weight like that, means your sugars are very high,that's how we found out he was diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0When he went to his Dr., it was over 500, he's lucky to have reached 42 now.\u00a0\u00a0Better managed, but still not the best.\u00a0\u00a0Please, go see your Dr. right away.\u00a0\u00a0At those levels, you may not wake up one morning, and that is very scary!Good luck and please let us know what your Dr. says.",

            "answer": "I am under the care of a doctor and called her office and talked to the doctor on call, he told me to drink water until there were no ketones present. My glucose has not been higher than 198, so I am not sure why ketones were present. I have an appointment with an Endo on Tuesday and hopefully they will be able to figure out what is going on. I forgot to mention that I contracted Valley Fever 2 years ago and have\u00a0\u00a0been symptom free from it for over a year.My 15 year old son has type 1 so I am familiar with diabetes, but I was not aware that an adult over 35 could get it.",

            "answer": "hi, I just got out of the hospital with dka and they said I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. My question is can it be possible to have type 2 with dka cause I just found out that they didn't do any blood work to detect if I am for sure type 1 or 2. I am 30 years old just gave birth to my first baby 6 months ago and I had getstational diabetes and was able to control with diet. After giving birth I never followed up with the glucose test and 6 months later I am in the emergency room. The shock of my life. Never in my life think that I would end up like this. Then I was told that my thyroid is underactive as well. I just want to know if u get dka can u still be type 2?",
