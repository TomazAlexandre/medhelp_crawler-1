            "answer": "Hi Dr. Anthony,I am a 28 year old female. I have no prior history of any diseases or ailment, athough, my mother has hypertension and my father has diabetes. I have a very stressful and labor intensive job. The\u00a0\u00a0initial complaint was pelvic pain starting in November 2008. Then it went to back pain, and then became full blown anxiety attacks that came with a host of symptoms.( ie, chest pain, dizziness, arm and leg numbness, and lightheadedness). I have been out of work on sick leave since January 2009. As of lately I am not getting much sleep due to the discomfort in my throat. The discomfort started after I choked on water. The same night, I began to feel the \"lump\" sensation. I spoke about it to my PCP and she said that I was anxious and that it was probably a goiter. Well the ultrasound did not show that. I am still waiting on the results of my thyroid functions. On a sadness scale I would say that I am very sad because of this throat condition. I have a GI appointment next Tuesday. My monthly cycles are normal.I am not currently on any meds. I was on Percocet for pain. I stopped that weeks ago because I didnt like the side effects. I was on Hydroxyzine for anxiety. Not taking that anymore because prescription ran out (given by ER).Thanks so much for your response.",

            "answer": "If your 'lump' persists for weeks, he may have to order further tests. Well, I am sorry I am in a different geographical area and hence unable to see you. Most of your symptoms including the choking part can be the result of anxiety. Hope you don't have heartburn. The choking might have caused some local bruise ? and hence the funny sensation later. That should pass off in a few days. If it doesn't, one can think of a visit to ENT who will examine the throat and may be the larynx with a mirror/ scope, may order basic blood investigations and an Xray of neck side view. If nothing abnormal is seen, you will be advised and re-assured. And may be put on Alprazolam or the like tablets, at least for 10 days with two purposes, one is to allay the anxiety and second is to relieve the muscle tightening in the throat which might be the reason for your 'lump'. This will even work as a therapeutic test.But all these seem superfluous as you are feeling down now, and this may be the reason for all.If you feel sad, it has to be dealt with, as your 'sensations' will heighten and you may develop more symptoms pushing your doctor to do more and more tests.About your pelvic pain shifting to low back, may have to be evaluated by a gynaecologist if the PCP feels so. What is your GI app for?Hope this helps.Best rgds,TA",
