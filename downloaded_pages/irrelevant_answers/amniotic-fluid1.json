            "answer": "Have you already been tested for gestational diabetes? A big warning sign of that is when baby has too much fluid (also a normal side effect depending on when the diabetes is diagnosed and how well you take care of it). My sis had gd with both her kids and also had high fluid levels.What it means is that because your sugars are high, baby's sugars are way too high and it increases urine output. Since baby makes, swallows, and pees out your fluid, too much or too little can lead to (or be symptoms of) bigger problems.Since yours wasn't diagnosed via ultrasound yet, I would call your doc/midwife and make an appointment for a scan to check it if you're worried!",

        {
            "answer": "Depends on how worried you are. High fluid levels can be dangerous but it's be hesitant to do anything without an ultrasound to confirm it. Just a guess based on how often you feel baby move? I'd maybe call and talk to your doc to see if you even need to worry.One of the reasons you give a urine sample at every visit is do that they can test the sugar levels in your urine. If it was reading extra high, they would have probably asked you to test for gd sooner.",

            "answer": "Everyone carries differently though. I've looked close to term since my first tri! But I'd call in the morning. No sense losing sleep over it. Let your doc know what was said and that you're worried. You might be able to move the test up if that's what would help you feel better.",
