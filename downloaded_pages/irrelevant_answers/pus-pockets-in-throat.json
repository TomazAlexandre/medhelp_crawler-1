            "answer": "You seem to be describing something known as keratosis tonsillis or keratosis pharyngis. It is difficult to treat. Some advise urea gargles.If your ear has been in pain, it has to be looked into. One side or both? If the ear appears normal to the ENT specialist, he will search for conditions which can 'refer' a pain to the ear. Like conditions in the throat, teeth etc.Parotid area pain, if it is new, may be different. Is it associated with local swelling, tenderness? Do you have fever?\u00a0\u00a0What is your age? Are you a diabetic? On any medication?Best,Dr.Thomas Antony",

    "question": "I went through 3 ENT's - one said a sinus infection that was leaking out through my throat. One said nothing was wrong with me. One did tests, said he didn't see any stones, but told me to have sour candy throughout the day. Many antibiotics, sour candies, and allergy pills later - the pus pockets are back. I can expel them with a q-tip, but they are filled again within a few hours. My ear has been in pain for almost a year. Today, though - it seems instead of one or two, I have 8 or 9 all in the general area of my parotid gland. Only on one side.Has anyone had anything like this? Do I just keep going through the yellow pages for ENT's??",
