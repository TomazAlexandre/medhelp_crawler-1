Do you have other risk factors for diabetes?The good news that if it isn't thyroid related, that you caught it EARLY and before it becomes full fledged diabetes. Start making the proper changes now. Hopefully it's thyroid related and resolve on it's on once you get stabilized(assuming you aren't?)",

Things will slow down in the winter.\u00a0\u00a0After the diabetes diagnosis, I went on a lower carb diet.\u00a0\u00a0So far I have lost 30 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0Another 30 and I will be at my pre-thyroid weight, but I could lose another 30 after that I'm sure.\u00a0\u00a0 I got very heavy.\u00a0\u00a0I did do a health fair at work.\u00a0\u00a0A few months ago, I was told that my bad cholesteral was near 300 and it is down to 161.\u00a0\u00a0A ways to go, but much better and no meds.\u00a0\u00a0My blood sugar was 160...it's now down to around 103, but it does have a tendency to gain at night.\u00a0\u00a0and my good cholesteral is actually a bit low, but for now, I'll take it.\u00a0\u00a0Oh yeah and my AC1? was at 7 and now it is at 5.6.I have energy again. The last time I was out here, I just never thought I would have energy ever again.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I am back and I didn't think that would ever happen either.I feel bad that I am out here gloating when I know soooo many people are hurting and confused.\u00a0\u00a0But it DOES get better.Last I knew my TSH was .18 or something like that. Low to suppress and my Free T4 was decent and of course, no Free T3 readings.It's good talking to you all again.\u00a0\u00a0I was missing my thyroid family.\u00a0\u00a0Just a couple of months ago, I was getting very depressed. So I peeked, but didn't really have anything new to talk about.\u00a0\u00a0I came out a while back and started up some of my trackers again.\u00a0\u00a0They are very handy.\u00a0\u00a0I also checked out a diabetes forum.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully, I have that in check without taking any meds at this point.",
