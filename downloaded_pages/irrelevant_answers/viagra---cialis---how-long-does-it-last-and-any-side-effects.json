    "question": "I'm type 2 diabetic and overweight and have not had any erection problems until this year when during foreplay I'd be as hard as a rock, but go soft just before insertion... my wife has been understanding, but it has been frustrating. My Doctor said that erection problems are more common than people think - especially for people over 40 and she could prescribe a generic 'Cialis' if need be but I was too embarrassed to take up the offer.I understand that it takes about 30 minutes for 'things to happen' after taking a dose of Cialis. - is this correct?? what are peoples experiences with this?Also are their any side effects from taking Cialis or Viagra?I'm on oral medication and insulin for my diabetes - would Cialis mess with my diabetes\u00a0\u00a0or vice versa?I am interested to hear about other peoples experiences with Cialis / Viagra",
