            "answer": "Who knows they should have been given you an earlier pcr in order to predict that now its more of a gamble.Other factors are also importent such as how much damage has you liver? have you done a biopsy?What was your baseline viral load?Are you coinfected with hiv? Do you have diabetes or insulin resistance?I dont know much about thyroid problems if the damage already is done does it help stopping treatment earlier don\u00b4t know.Others knows better about that sure they will chime in.What we know is that geno 2 is the best geno (easiest to treat) but is that because more 2s got a rapid response UND before week 4 in your case we never know what you are we have had some geno 2s that didn\u00b4t make it and some how made it with\u00a0\u00a0very short tx.You don\u00b4t wanna treat again so in my opinion you better play it safe unless you don\u00b4t think the damage from meds would be worse than the HCV.Good luck whatever you decide !ca",
