            "answer": "i have the same fcking prob... started some 5 years ago. it hurts bad, i tried looking up some books and net and all i find is these answers1. the boils on head are usually caused because of the heat in your body. so if temperature of your surroundings are high , one starts having boils (which is true for me )solution to this is:i) Take two tsp olive oil , 1 tsp caster oil , mix well until bubbles come out. Then apply on the head. Keep it for 1 or 2 hours. Then apply grinded fenugreek paste, wait for 1 hr minimum then wash it out. This gives some relief for some days.ii) apply yogurt on hair before you shower, will help for a week.2. the boils are caused on head mainly to the people who have oily skin and/or cant digest oil and fat in body.Solution : eat less fatty and oily food. and dont apply oil in hair.3.some people complain of gettig boils after eating anyhting containing cocoa.solutiion : dont eat chocolates...hope this helps yout friend and me too ;)",

            "answer": "i have very bad boils on my head. i did some research online and have been helped so much. My doctor wanted me on antibiotics for them, but like so many other people, i read about, the boils became worse after taking the medicine. So this is what i am doing, it is fairly extreme but if you hate the boils as much as me, it will totally be worth it.1. take turmeric extract 3 times a day. make sure to read the label. (got it at whole foods)2. eliminate all oil from my diet. i mean ALL. it's so hard. lean meats, no nuts, and read labels for low fat content.3. no caffeine. Just deal with the headaches for a day or two, and remember that a lot of sodas have caffeine. i stick to diet lemon lime or diet root beer.4. no chocolate.5. lots of fruits and veggies.6. no white flour, no sugar. I use some whole grains and i read labels to make sure i'm only getting natural sugars. BUT LIMIT THESE!!7. clean head with astringent then apply neosporin. daily8. apply yogurt to head once a week. it's gross. and may sting a little.9. exercise regularly.10. drink lots of water. make your pee clear all the time!!!!!! haha.well this stuff really worked for me. it has amazed me and my family at how clear my head has become after 7 years of pain, embarassment, wearing hats, and waking up to bloody pillows. (if you have boils you know what i mean!)\u00a0\u00a0I am sooo grateful to all the people who left comments on various websites. I hope this helps. Like i said it is extreme, so run it by your doctor.i have lots of good recipe ideas too. if anyone is interested.",

I have also been suffering from these boils for quite some time now. I thought it might have had something to do with the large amounts of heat my hair trapped. You see, I have dreadlocks and I live in the tropics. My boils arn't cronic but come at unregular intervals. I tried going easy on the fatty oily foods and that kind of helped. Up until now I didn`t know what to do to treat my boils so thank you all for your informative suggestions :)",

            "answer": "I've had these for years now and I know what causes mine and probably most of yours...It's anxiety as the head is over heating...Its like when you get hot flushes throughout your body.I get a red hot strip across my nose and eyes often and when I feel the back of my neck it's always very very warm hence the heat produces boils and spots.I've had a rare anxiety of going by speed and the clock for years in whatever I do(rush rush rush) and after years of research and getting nowhere at the doctors and hospital I cracked it myself.I have now finally learnt to relax more although it's a slow process naturally,but the progress is amazing so far.Learn to relax and breath properly aswell as the usual exercising and eating well.Naturally some may have something different,but I'd bet my right Bollock it's anxiety for most.",
