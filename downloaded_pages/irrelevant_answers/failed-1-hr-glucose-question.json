            "answer": "I would definitely say most likely not. my bf's mom said she had to redo the whole thing because it was off, but she didn't have any problems.. Sometimes it's just a tad high, it sucks you have to do the 3 hour test... But if it's only one point, chances are that you will be fine. Those levels can fluctuate so it may just be something you ate the night before, or something. Try not to worry about it too much. And good luck.",

    "question": "Well Tuesday I was scheduled for my one hour glucose screening test, my score came back one point too high.. 121 so I have to go back in on Tuesday for the 3 hour test, with it really only being one point over do you think that there is that big of a chance that I'll have the gestational diabetes? Im' really nervous about the whole thing, I also am anemic so I started on my iron so hopefully after it builds up some I'll be feeling a little better.. if any of you have info on gestational diabetes let me know please.. thanks again",
