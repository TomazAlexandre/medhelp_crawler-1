            "answer": "hi girlie,I do not know much in this area being a one timer and all, but I do know that some times they pick up the size of the baby later on in pregnancy when it is easier to feel the fundal height and readjust due date. As cheesy as it may sound - just visualize a perfect and healthy baby - and s/he might have to just \"cook\" a little longer if your due date was off.What are the measurements - are they your fundus?",

            "answer": "I think that with your height it would make a difference. But at the same time there should have been some growth. Try not to worry too much until the ultrasound. i do have a friend that they had to induce her because the baby had stopped growing and she spent some time in the nicu, but is totally normal and caught up in growth, it just wasn't happening in her mom's belly",

            "answer": "hey jem,it totally does not sound cheesy to visualize a healthy baby. that's what i've been trying to do. i know how important it is to try to be stress free (yeah, right!) in times like these. it's\u00a0\u00a0good advice.my measurement at 30 weeks is 24cm. hasn't changed in a month! what's really weird is that my belly has definitely gotten bigger. i don't know why this doesn't correspond when i lay down, but it just doesn't. it's really, really hard to have to wait so long!!arrrrrrrgh!i will definitely post friday evening when i'm back from my ultrasound.thanks for writing!",

            "answer": "Hey there, I have a little input for you. I have been measuring small since 24 weeks, but on an ultrasound. I am also 5'10\", and I am measuring perfectly on the outside, but the baby is measuring about 2 1/2, 3 weeks small. The point being, the belly\u00a0\u00a0measurements are just an estimate, they aren't always on par with what is going on inside. And I definitely also try to stay just as positive as possible, which is hard sometimes being on bed rest, but I try to keep upbeat. I hope everything goes well on your ultrasound, keep us posted! :)",

            "answer": "Hi There,I have a little story to share with you, Jem told me you might be interested to hear this -I had a scary appointment at the hospital yesterday, I had a different doctor and I asked her if she could guess how much my baby weighs. She started feeling her (my baby) then measured my stomach and said she thinks she is quite small. Then she compared the measurements and said she was getting the same measurement from 36 weeks (I am now 40 weeks). So they sent me up for an ultrasound and everything was normal except my fluid was a little on the low side, but nothing to be concerned about. The baby weighs 7 pounds 8 onz - which is completely normal. The doctor also said that I may be measuring small because my bmi was lower before I got pregnant and I am tall. But they thought my baby was way too small just by feeling her and measuring, and they were wrong, so I bet that's just what is going to happen to you. I also speak to another girl on here and at 34/35 weeks she experienced a similar thing - and an ultrasound confirmed her baby was fine too.So don't be worried, you may just be carrying differently. If you are still feeling regular movements then everything is fine (the doctor told me not to worry before sending me for an ultrasound because the baby is still moving a lot).Good luck with everything!!",

    "question": "hi everybody!i had a dr.'s appointment today, and found out that i don't have gestational diabetes. yaaay! but the joy was short lived.i'm measuring WAY too small for 30 weeks. the past 3 appointments, i've measured between 23 and 25cm. today i only measured 24cm. i'm sure that my due date is right, and i'm scheduled for an ultrasound on friday.has anybody else had this experience? i'm tall- 5'10- so i know that maybe the baby is being carried differently because of my height, but i'm really worried. i feel like having diabetes would be much easier! arrrrrgh! just when i get done worrying about another problem, something worse pops up!i'm worried and frustrated. it's gonna suck to wait for friday.",
