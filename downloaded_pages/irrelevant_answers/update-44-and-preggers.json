            "answer": "Congratulations!!\u00a0\u00a0I am so happy to hear your pregnancy is progressing smoothly.Try not to worry to much about the first trimester screen and the higher odds of trisonomy 21.\u00a0\u00a0My first trimester screen came back with 1:13 odds of downs syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0I was worried and opted for amnio.\u00a0\u00a0I am not in any way, shape or form telling you that amnio is the way to go, that is a highly personal decision, but for me it turned out to be the right one.\u00a0\u00a0The procedure itself was not painful at all, and everything went smoothly.\u00a0\u00a0It came back showing my son was just fine and I am now able to relax and enjoy the rest of this pregnancy.The reality is that even though our odds of downs syndrome are higher (I will be 41 at delivery), very few babies are actually born with it.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, in two years of being on these boards I have met one women whose baby actually had chromosonal abnormalities ( I am not including those that miscarried, just those whose babies went full term) and it was something other then 21.\u00a0\u00a0The other women I have met on MedHelp that had DS babies were in their 20's and early 30's.I wish you a happy and healthy pregnancy, and look forward to reading your updates!!\u00a0\u00a0Congratulations again!!\u00a0\u00a0Amanda",

    "question": "Hi All.....first up - thank you for your overwhelming support, i appreciate all the well wishes, notes and prayers, thank you!\u00a0\u00a0Went to obgyn yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0All is well.\u00a0\u00a0i am officially 9 weeks 2 days pregnant today.\u00a0\u00a0Did ultrasound and saw and heard heartbeat - amazing.\u00a0\u00a0i have to return in 3 weeks for him to check the baby's nuchal translucency (nt) and do first trimester blood screening.\u00a0\u00a0he said at my age the risk of having a baby with DS or other chromosomal abnorms is one in forty (as opposed to one in two hundred for a 24 year old).\u00a0\u00a0he also said this averages only about 2.5% chance which means i do have a 97.5% chance of a healthy baby, it depends on how i want to look at it.\u00a0\u00a0He said he will monitor for diabetes which runs in my family as well as heart defects (both my older sister and I were born with a hole in our heart (asd) and we each had successful surgery in adulthood to repair). my iron was slightly low which would explain some of my endless fatigue, so he put me on iron supplements.\u00a0\u00a0other than this i am happy to report the baby and i are healthy.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes to all other pregnant older first time (and repeat) moms.\u00a0\u00a0to those still trying i am sending positive thoughts your way.\u00a0\u00a0Until my next update, take care.\u00a0\u00a0Hazel",
