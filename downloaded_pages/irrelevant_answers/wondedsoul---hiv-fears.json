            "answer": "Hi, the problems with motions and runny nose are not symptoms of HIV. A runny nose can be due to common cold and lose motions generally are observed in a patient suffering from contaminated food consumption, contaminated drinking water or stomach flu. You never had a risk and you are safe from HIV in the case stated above.",

            "answer": "You do not need any prayers :) because you are absolutely safe. More than half of the population in the world practice oral sex. Just imagine, if oral sex carried any risks for HIV, major of the population would have been HIV positive by now. On an average of 10 people, 8 people practice oral sex without a condom. The more you read over internet through G**gle which are mostly unreliable sources, the more you would feel sad about your sex life. Trust me, there are sources over internet that would also mention kissing as a risk for HIV transmission, if we believe that, we all should be HIV positive by now. :) Bottom line, think practically and enjoy your sex life with full protection. There is no harm in having sex if its well protected.",

Whether it be sexual or needle stick injury.I think it comes from the liability of the medical field/medical facility to have the person who was exposed to a needle stick injury to test @ 6 months...since they more than likely stick to the \"old standard\" for legal reasons.Testing @ 13 weeks would be conclusive considered you do not have: Junior Rheumatoid Arthritis, onset of diabetes, Lupus, blood transfusion, or any other medical condition that has impacted your immune system recently.A test for a \"normal\" (and I use that term loosely) individual would have known their positive result @ 6- 8 weeks.I believe health care workers still \"stick\" to the old CDC standard since 1985, which is 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0Any \"normal\" human being would know by 6 weeks as far as I am concerned.I remember several years ago being tested (and this was in 1998), the woman who had tested me said: \"Put it this way, if you were infected with the flu (a virus) , would it really take 3 months to create antibodies to it?\"\u00a0\u00a0Answer: No.I thought this was a great analogy....or isn't it?Brianhttp://www.medhelp.org/posts/HIV---Prevention/testing/show/255464Please comment....Experts...",
