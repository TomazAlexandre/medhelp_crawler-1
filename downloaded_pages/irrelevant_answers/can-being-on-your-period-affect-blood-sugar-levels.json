    "question": "For a few years now if I dont eat in the mornings and then go do some activity I start to feel like I'm going to pass out and have figured out its probably hypoglycemia, but it seems to be getting worse and especially if I'm on my period. Like this past week I have been on my period and on tuesday I ate breakfast and everything and went to school I was standing watching a teacher show us something when i started feeling weak and dizzy but my stomach hurt really bad and when i went to the bathroom i had diarrhea and sweating. I got some crackers and felt ok after a bit. Could i be anemic too? I dunno.",
