            "answer": "There are other options for mood stabilizers. Lamictal is one. As for antipsychotics what they usually use if nothing else works is Clozaril and that is an option but it has severe side effects such as blood dyscreias. I was unable to tolerate it myself and a certain number of people can't. I've put in posts that I'm on glycine a Phase II antipsychotic in FDA study that is a glutamate antagonist, a new class of medication entirely that promotes a fuller recovery and cannot cause tardive dyskinesia or diabetes. I am the first person to take it out outside of a controlled study under the supervision of a psychiatrist but my psychopharmocologist will be publishing the results in a psychiatric journal. However, in the meantime here's a link to the official studyhttp://www.schizophrenia.com/research/javitt.htmIn the official study its being given with a standard antipsychotic but here's a link to a glutamate antagonist that is being studied as a primary (stand alone) antipsychotic:http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/03/business/03drug.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1225576031-Mbg7g2ySRHb4DtAQVBeQlQI am the first person to take glycine as a primary antipsychotic and I'm not sure if the results will be duplicated in studies. I am not sure if psychiatrists would consider administering it to a person along with a currently available antipsychotic as except to research psychiatrists its an unknown, although I'm advocating to change that and as I would never advise people to change anything without consulting their psychiatrist first. Print out the link (from a psychiatric journal) to the official glycine study and if your psychiatrist thinks its something he'd consider pm me and I'll give you more information for him and of course I'll post a link to the study on me which is being approved by a research psychiatrist at a major psychiatric hospital as soon as its in print.",

            "answer": "What other mood stabilizers are there I've tried two others which disagreed with my body I was on Lamotrigine and broke out in a rash so I am alergic to it and back in 1998 I was on Depakote it was a big pink pill I remember it because I threw it up again a lot of times so that one disagrees with me too",
