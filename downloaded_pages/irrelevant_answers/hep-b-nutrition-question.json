            "answer": "here is what i cut down on or stopped completely after i found ouyt i had HBV some 7 months ago- alcohol :\u00a0\u00a0never had a drink in my life so that wasnt an issue- smoking: i was a light smoker like 2 cigs a day and i quit it anyway some 4 or 5 years ago. i did smoke hookah though but i stopped that too when i found out i had the virus- instead of a large cup of coffee daily , now i drink a small cup maybe once a week or maybe 4-6 times a month.- soda: i loveeeeddddd soda and that was hard for me to quit. well, i didnt but same for coffee i drink a pop\u00a0\u00a0maybe a few times a month and when i do i stick to a warm gingerale soda .- rarely touch ice cream. and i love ice cream.very limited eating of fatty food. i feel guilty thereafter even knowing i really didnt have much anyway.i cant say i am depriving myself of food. i stayed away from most of the food i love . when i do i get a bite or two as a treat .i cant say i miss the food though. i look at it its just a phase of my life that is in my past and and when i look at my two little children i think to myself\u00a0\u00a0food that will get me sick isnt worth not being able to see the two devils grow before my eyes.it isnt hard really. by quiting the things that your liver dont like , you're kinda like not giving the virus the things it likes to feed on as well... dont give it a reason to get you and instead make it quit your body and go away.",

Damn, that's going to be tough to quit!\u00a0\u00a0I don't smoke, eat healthy and work out almost everyday. I do occasionally have beer or wine but I'm going to work on dropping those too. I have a few questions/comments on what you all wrote.CAJIM: For #3-5 in your reply, is this the general protocol for all HEP B patients or those with poor health? I'm in good shape, exercise often and am not overweight. My blood pressure, glucose levels and cholesterol (HDL/LDL) levels are all normal. With that said, should I be concerned about removing tea/coffee, and rice as a cause for diabetes? I guess what I'm asking is do those items adversely effect your liver or is it the subsequent hypertension or diabetes from those items that is a problem?ZELLYF: How are sweets hard on the liver? Is it the over consumption that leads to fatty liver or is it just sweets in general? i.e. If I'm in shape will an occasional dessert effect my liver directly?\u00a0\u00a0Also, any links or info you can direct me to on the topic of drinking and HEP B?STEVENNYR:\u00a0\u00a0Spicy food is bad?

Also, how does an undercooked steak effect your liver?\u00a0\u00a0Are these recommendations for a person who already exhibits liver damage or for one that is a carrier but with no damage?BBERRY:\u00a0\u00a0Why is soda and coffee bad? Is it the artificial sweeteners that are cause for concern?All: Sorry for the long winded post, but I'm just trying to learn as much as I can. Thanks again for all your comments.R",

I've been spending some time reading but wanted to get some feedback on some nutritional and supplement questions.For a background:I'm a 32 year old male of south asian decent. I have chronic Hep B since birth. Currently I'm on Lamividune thearpy alone.\u00a0\u00a0ALT/AST levels are in the normal range after starting Lamividune 15 months ago. My VL is UD currently.My question comes about diet. I couldn't find a good answer on what I should and should not be eating? Obviously alcohol is out of the question but is any amount acceptable? Does one or two drinks a week ocause damage or is the consenous that 0 drinks is the way to go.Is there a suggested diet one should follow that has been shown to benefit those with Hepatitis? Same goes for supplements?\u00a0\u00a0I know these are a lot of questions, but I'm just trying to figure out what is the best way for me to live the longest life I can. :)\u00a0\u00a0Thanks in advance!R",
