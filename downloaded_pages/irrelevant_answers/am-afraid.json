            "answer": "Hi ChapulinaI have been a type 1 Diabetic since the age of 6 and so have lived with the condition for 22 years now. I found that a lot of people out there say that it is a terrible thing to have and that there are bad things to come. These sorts of things are said by those who don't understand the condition. My wife is now pregnant and she too has\u00a0\u00a0type 1 diabetes and has been for over 10 years.We have done a lot of research into this before getting pregnant and there are many families who are fit and healthy after having children. Yes there are things to be careful of such as having high blood readings while pregnant. Here in the UK we regularly buy the Diabetes magazine and there is a lot of advice and support for those who are pregnant. There were 3 articles they published about moms who went through pregnancy and now have healthy children.Do regular blood tests and try aim to keep your readings between 4.5 and 7.5. Lower sugar readings may not be comfortable for yourself but are fine for your unborn.\u00a0\u00a0Let me know if there is anything more you want to chat about, but don't lose hope.",

Of course u worried, but that doesn't help. My sugars r ok, I get the occasional high, but its impossible to have perfect sugars all the time, the baby n me need to eat :-) I visit antenatal clinic every 3 week's n they r happy with my progress. U have to realise that some women get gestational diabetes n they might not even know about it for weeks or months...we r lucky in the way coz we r diagnosed :-) good luck n keep positive! x",

            "answer": "Hi,I am diabetic and have been for 20 years now. I also have 2 very healthy little girls. My rise pregnancy was pretty easy (I did have 2 seizures from low blood sugars) but my second pregnancy was a little rough (more due to the lymphoma Cancer I had). I am now pregnant with my 3rd baby and things are great! The hardest part was having to go c-section due to my girls being so large at birth. It is very common to have large babies when you are diabetic. My best advise is keep up with your sugars at all times and watch your diet. All will be food :)Best of luck to you and your baby and may God be with you they all of this.",
