The operation was successful (DRs say that).\u00a0\u00a0But the region around the operation took long time to heal (she has Diabetes) and finally, after 50 days, it did heal up but my mother still has severe pain around the operated region and in the back. Drs say that this is due to infection and will continue to be like that until the infection if fully cured.Questiona:a) How often the infection occursb) Is the residual pain primarily due to the infectionc) How much time it will take before the infection goes away.
