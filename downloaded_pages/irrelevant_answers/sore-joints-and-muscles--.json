    "question": "I am 57 years old and suffer from Anxiety disorder, the doctor has pretty much kept it under control with medication. The last month or so I have been waking up with sore joints and muscles in my arms and knees and my hands have been tingling. I also have been waking up with headaches, dry mouth and burning eyes. I get at least 8 hours of sleep, though its not a deep sleep. And I noticed my energy level has dropped. I noticed also that sometimes in the middle of the day I feel shaky and have to drink or eat something before the shakiness goes away. And I have noticed that my urine is cloudy and sometimes has a smell. My doctor is on vacation so it will be awhile before I can see him. Does anyone have any ideas what might be causing this ? I have not changed any meds or taken anything different. I am wondering if this could be some form of Anxiety that I never had before ! Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
