            "answer": "Post above mine had some possible reasons for your thirst problem. Also, do get tested for your adrenals. Aldosterone is an adrenal gland hormone that regulates the amount of salt, water , and potassium in your body. If it gets low, your body retains potassium, and loses salt and water. Mine is low, and I am frequently thirsty and dehydrated because of it. Have to add generous amounts of salt to my diet, which definitely helps. (I have low\u00a0\u00a0blood pressure, which many people with an adrenal problem do). also suffer from consistent fatigue and don't handle stress well, which are a couple of symptoms of low functioning adrenals and/or a thyroid problem.This is a possibility, would look into it. Don't let any doctor tell you certain tests aren't necessary. They have no idea what may be causing your problem and need to explore different areas until the problem is pinpointed. Your doctor told you to drink more water and eliminate salt? Unbelievable. Lack of the ability to hold salt in your system could possibly be the problem! They should not be deciding on a treatment until they figure out the problem. I would get a new and knowledgeable doc!Dixie1",

I dont know whats wrong with you though for sure, and maybe you just have a tendency to drink a lot and you dont have a problem at all. you could mention it to a doctor though. note: im not a doctor",
