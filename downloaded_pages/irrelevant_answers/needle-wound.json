You really need to see a physician.There are several antibiotic options, and sometimes the wound has to be opened op to drain. They do this with a mild anaesthetic so it isn't too painful.See if you can work something out about the payments. I'm sure you can find someone who will do that.",

            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Yes, agreed, one option is that the pus has got encapsulated and needs to be opened up and drained. The other possibility is that your blood sugar is high. Wounds either do not heal or take a long time to heal in people with diabetes especially if the wounds are at high pressure points. You need to get your blood sugar tested both fasting and two hours after food. Do consult your primary care first.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I stabbed my forefinger with a safety pin nearly three months ago. The wound is not showing any progress of healing. When pressure is put on the wound (which is rather often because I use that finger to write with), it causes a piercing pain. There also seems to be a blister underneath the outer scab. I happen to be in the ER last month and I showed it to my ER doctor. He said that it appeared to be nothing to worry about, but gave me a tetanus shot as a precaution. Still, upon cleaning it daily with peroxide and an antibiotic, there is stl no progress. Not only is this \"little\" cut a nuisance, but it's painful. I don't have health insurance so I've been waiting it out. Can anyone please help?",
