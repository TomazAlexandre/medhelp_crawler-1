            "answer": "I was just recently diagnosed with diverticulosis.\u00a0\u00a0I still have chronic pain in my lower abdomin and have for months now.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor chocked my pain up to a mystery when I was diagnosed just over a month ago.\u00a0\u00a0My constipation has turned into diarahea and it has been pretty bad for over 3 weeks now.\u00a0\u00a0I go 10 to 15 times a day. Everything I eat just goes right thru me. I have had loss of appetite and am loosing weight too. Sometimes but not often I all of a sudden feel very sick and want to throw up but can't. I went back to see my doctor early this week about the constant diarahea and he says that there is no way my diverticulosis could turn into diverticulitis when only 2 pouches were found in the diverticula. He says there has to be many.\u00a0\u00a0I couldn't find any information that states there has to be a number of these pouches in order for inflamation to take place and it turn into diverticulitis . So now he has me doing other tests to check for colitis and crones disease.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed 2 years ago with diabetes and this problem I have been having in the past few months has really taken a toll on my body and sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0There are days I am so sick to my stomach because of the stresses of this pain and diarahea and once my sugar levels come back down, I'm so weak and tired for days.\u00a0\u00a0It's bad enough that all the nutrients are just passing right through me and making me dehydrated. My doctor says we will do these tests and more than likely send me to a specialist.\u00a0\u00a0I should find out later this week.\u00a0\u00a0All I know is no matter what the problem may be with the bowel or colon........it isn't something to hold off on getting checked out.\u00a0\u00a0I'm hanging in there and trying to stay positive and really trying hard not to let any of this keep me down from my everyday life.",

            "answer": "Have you been tested for C. diff?\u00a0\u00a0That sounds exactly what I went through/am going through.\u00a0\u00a0It's even more likely if you were just on antibiotics recently, although many of us have figured out that major hormone changes (like birth) happened before the C. diff infection... Don't know if it's related or not, but it's a really nasty infection, and should be dealt with immediately if possible. You might want to talk to a doc and ask if they'll do a stool sample...",
