            "answer": "Hi Keaka,I am not a medical professional but a volunteer on this forum and a Type I diabetic. From what I know diabetes can cause impotence in men. It affects autonomic nerves, which go from your spinal cord to your lungs, heart, stomach, intestines, bladder, and sex organs. Men who have had diabetes for many years can be affected by the damage to these nerves, resulting in impotence.The Joslin Diabetes Center website has some information on how to treat this condition. You may find it at: https://store.joslin.org/Beginners_guide_605.aspIt includes information on methods such as: injections, pumps, as well as surgical.You may also want to check out the American Diabetes Association's site on Diabetes and Men's Sexual Health: http://www.diabetes.org/type-1-diabetes/men-sexual-health.jspHere are some of their options:-Taking pills to treat ED (erectile dysfunction)-Putting medicine called prostaglandins (prahs-ta-GLAND-ins) into the penis-Using a vacuum tube and pump that you put over the penis. The pump creates a vacuum in the tube. The vacuum draws blood into the penis. A band is placed around the base of the penis so you keep the erection after you take off the vacuum tube-Having surgery to put a device in the penis. Surgery can also fix blood vessels so more blood will flow to the penisImpotence is fairly common in diabetic men but it can be treated. Consult the above sources and it also wouldn't hurt to speak to a doctor about it. I know it may not be something your husband feels comfortable talking to his doctor about, but endocrinologists are well aware of this condition affecting many diabetic men so I'm sure they deal with it a lot and can offer solutions to alleviate the problem.Good luck and take care!",

            "answer": "Hi KeakaI read with interest your question about your husband's impotence challenges caused by type 1 diabetes. I have come across a pharmacist who is also a diabetic, and he has a lot of knowledge in this area. I know for sure he sends out a really useful free report on the whole subject of Diabetes and Impotence.It mainly addresses type II Diabetes but the symptoms will probably be the same, (i'm guessing).Anyway, it might be worth a look at www.ironmanmaximus.com",
