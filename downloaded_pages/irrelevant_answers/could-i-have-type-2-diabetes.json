    "question": "I have been going mad trying to get rid of a yeast infection that has persisted over a week now.3 treatments and yet the itching and a rash on my thighs have persisted and I won't heal.\u00a0\u00a0My std' work up came up normal this afternoon- although I am awaiting results of HIV bloodwork.In conjunction with the yeast infection I have experienced such fatigue like never before.\u00a0\u00a0My lower back has stabbing pain and I am thirsty with a dry mouth.\u00a0\u00a0My vision has slowly gotten worse over the past few years- but the past couple weeks I feel is getting more blurry and I feel confused and disconnected in my day to day tasks.I haven't been able to eat for a couple days- it's an effort to put food in my mouth and when I do eat i get tired, so all I want to do is drink fuids.\u00a0\u00a0I also have a mild headache that won't go away.I realize these could be stressed related- but the vaginal itching and now the rash that has spread down my legs- it's just itchy and red, no bumps or dryness.Any thoughts on this?\u00a0\u00a0I only presented with a yeast infection initially- and they didn't test me for diabetes- but i see I match many of the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I have always has a skin fissue on my anus, but now that fissure has doubled in size and has developed another tag on top of the old one I have always had, and that tag is harder and more bumpy.\u00a0\u00a0It does not look like a wart- the doc did check that too.I haven't been back to the doc in a week- but these symptoms persist.Should I go back tomorrow and ask about diabetes?It didn't come up in conversation before because I wasn't presenting these symptoms as badly as I seem to be now.\u00a0\u00a0No fever though... just a mild cough with some phlem and the heachache that goes away with advil.I am 38 years old, female, caucasion.Thank you in advance.",
