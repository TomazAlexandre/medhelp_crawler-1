    "question": "My feet and legs started to swell about two weeks ago, so much so I had to buy shoes two sizes than I usually wear.\u00a0\u00a0Shortly after my feet started to turn red.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know the cause of this and neither does my Doctor, although he has taken blood work but results still are not back.\u00a0\u00a0He said it could be caused by the heart not working correctly, my liver or my lungs.\u00a0\u00a0I would like to know if anyone else has had this problem and maybe shed a little light on this subject.Leigh",
