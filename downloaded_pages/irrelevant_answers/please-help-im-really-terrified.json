            "answer": "Hello Knicks30,I'm one of those non-doctors who may be able to help you sort out what's going on 'til you see your doctor.I'm aware of two ways to measure blood glucose (bg)\u00a0\u00a0or blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0The results mean about the same thing, but I think that \"normal\" in one is slightly different than in the other.\u00a0\u00a0BG can be measured in whole blood or blood plasma.\u00a0\u00a0A random reading of 88 in either is a normal reading.\u00a0\u00a0110 or 115 can be normal too, if it's not a fasting number.\u00a0\u00a0You mentioned the American Diabetes Association website.\u00a0\u00a0There (www.diabetes.org) they have a nice set of tables that give the ranges for normal, pre-diabetic, and diabetic.It's super super super that you're shedding pounds and beginning to exercise.\u00a0\u00a0It's important to check in with your doctor about your blood pressue (bp) , however.\u00a0\u00a0In general exercise can help lower our bp and our bg and yet it can be harmful if our bodies aren't yet ready for it.I encourage you to check in wiht your doc and tell him/her that you're concerned about your bp.\u00a0\u00a0S/he will likely want you to get a blood pressure cuff so you can learn to do tests thru-out the day to see how things are going.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't be surprised if s/he also wanted to start you on bp meds.The vision complaints might be bp related, especially if you have some dizziness or shortness of breath.\u00a0\u00a0BP is not something to ignore.Vision irregularities can be related to bg also, but it sounds as tho' you're doing so well at keeping yours in normal ranges, I'd be surprised if your bg is the cause.\u00a0\u00a0There are also plenty of eye related issues that may make it worthwhile for you to make an appt with an eye doctor.\u00a0\u00a0You may be able to start with an optomotrist (but not an optician);\u00a0\u00a0diabetics are urged to be followed by a opthalmologist (a physician who specializes in eye stuff and is trained in more depth than than optomotrists).The threat of diabetes is frightening indeed.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that with your motivation and your terrific progress on making good lifestyle choices, you'll stave it off.You asked \"how long\" could one keep diabetes at bay such that you wouldn't need medication to help control it.\u00a0\u00a0It's an interesting question that's tough to answer.\u00a0\u00a0I know one fellow who is \"technically\" diabetic (once a diabetic, you're always a diabetic; research has not yet found a cure).\u00a0\u00a0He began (as you have) a rigorous weight loss and gradually increasing exercise program.\u00a0\u00a0He has been diabetic now for 3 years and is not on meds.\u00a0\u00a0His bgs are within normal ranges.\u00a0\u00a0He is *not* cured, however.\u00a0\u00a0If he were to lessen his routine his numbers would rise.\u00a0\u00a0There is always a chance that even with his rigorous commitment, his pancreas will continue to be stressed to the point it needs help (in the form of either oral meds, insulin or both).I know another fellow who was diagnosed about that long ago also.\u00a0\u00a0He fixed his diet and has committed to exercise.\u00a0\u00a0He is now at a healthy weight for his height.\u00a0\u00a0His numbers are normal and he, too, is still a type 2 diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Just a few weeks ago, he asked his doctor if he could start on insulin because he'd noticed that his fasting bg had crept up in recent months from 90s - low 100s to 110s-120s.\u00a0\u00a0He did nothing \"wrong\" to himself to cause that rise.\u00a0\u00a0His body just needs more help than his diet & exercise has afforded him.Hope this helps allay some of the fears.\u00a0\u00a0Do check in with your doctor and simply *insist* on good medical care.\u00a0\u00a0At 19, you can look forward to 80 years of a good life if you continue the good progress you're making already.\u00a0\u00a0You deserve a good doctor to work with you.",

            "answer": "Well today i ate a bowl of cereal and a apple at 11:30 am. At 12:15 i started to swim and only swam for 30 minutes. After i swam i got really sick and vomited so i got scared and bought me one of those strips at wal-greens, spent like 85 dollars! I tested it at 2:15 pm and the reading was 102. I will admitt i had a sip of milk like half hour before. Is 102 normal despite the exercise and food i ate, plus the sip of milk?I scheduled an appointment with the doc for wednesday just to REALLY make sure.Thanks you again and last time i comment i promise!",

            "answer": "Hi again, Knicks -Please know that your comments & questions are welcome here.\u00a0\u00a0I am certain that the questions you have are shared by the many many folks who read this board without ever posting.102 is a perfectly normal bg for middle of the day.Feeling sick after exercise can be a sign of being too low or too high -- or being physically unready for the workout.\u00a0\u00a0It might also be related to blood pressure issues.I'm glad you invested in the tester & strips.\u00a0\u00a0You'll gain a lot of insight into what your body is telling you AND you'll have good data to share with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Your instincts are good already -- to think about testing when you feel lousy.\u00a0\u00a0That's what diabetics are taught to do, also.If you happen to test and see numbers below 70, you should treat those with quick-acting carbohydrates.\u00a0\u00a0Ideally, 15gm of glucose in the form of pure glucose (jel or tabs).\u00a0\u00a0Glucose tabs are relatively expensive compared to other almost-as-quick acting sources of carbos like: lifesaver candies, jelly beans, juice.\u00a0\u00a0The key is to control the amount we take to treat a low.\u00a0\u00a0Most foods in the US now have nutrition labels that tell us the serving size & the carbos per serving.\u00a0\u00a0To treat a low, we should avoid things that slow the action of the carbo.\u00a0\u00a0Protein & fat slows the action of carbos, so we shouldn't treat a low with yummy treats like chocolate candy, a sandwich, or cookies that all have ingredients besides the quick-acting carbos.Soooo, Knicks30.\u00a0\u00a0You're on the road to feeling better and being in better health.\u00a0\u00a0I have a feeling your doc is gonna be impressed with your progress so far.\u00a0\u00a0Do talk to him/her about your bp also.Until you post again, take good care of you (and try to be patient with yourself, too).\u00a0\u00a0I hope you keep reading on this forum and posting questions & comments as they arise.\u00a0\u00a0There's lots of good info shared here.",

            "answer": "Hey Knicks -You'll probably hear from others, too, so keep checking.Up to 110 has been the traditional cutoff.\u00a0\u00a0In recent years, research has apparently revealed that it's safer to consider below-100 as really normal.\u00a0\u00a0Given that there's testing variation, however, I'm sure your doc is most interested in trends over time.Blood sugar changes not only in 3 months, but often within 3 minutes!\u00a0\u00a0That's right!\u00a0\u00a0Folks with diabetes are taught to test often and many of us test 5-8 times a day because many things affect our bg:What we eatExerciseStress (good stress like a surprise party or bad stress ...)Health or illnessand some of us joke that gnomes & gremlins play a role, too, when we see changes that we cannot explain with other stuff.It just occurred to me that you might like to ask your doc for a prescription for a blood test meter & strips, so you can begin to track your own bgs.\u00a0\u00a0It takes a little practice, but in no time, you'll be a pro.\u00a0\u00a0Then you can see for yourself the big impact that your exercise & food choices will have in the span of a day.\u00a0\u00a0Over time, you'll know your body's responses & may not test very often.\u00a0\u00a0Some borderline diabetics will test a lot for a while to learn their patterns, and once they figure out how to stay in the \"good numbers zone\" then test occasionally to see if the patterns still hold.Remember it is *normal* for bg to rise after a meal.\u00a0\u00a0It is normal for it to come back down within 2-3 hours.\u00a0\u00a0Some borderline diabetics find that while their numbers do come down, it takes 3-5 or more hours to do so.\u00a0\u00a0That might signal an impaired insulin response (meaning that your body may not squirt out enuf insulin soon enuf to bring your bg down).\u00a0\u00a0It is also the case that folks who're overweight -- almost by definition -- have insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0Your body is making lots of insulin but somehow the fat cells interfere with its action.\u00a0\u00a0In time, as you continue to shed weight, you pancreas won't have to make so much insulin since you'll gradually get rid of your insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0With your weight loss already, you've taken a lot of stress off your insulin-making cells already, too.There's a lot to absorb so be patient with yourself and keep accumulating more knowledge on how to take good care of you.\u00a0\u00a0You're clearly a very bright young man and so I think you'll master what you need just fine.\u00a0\u00a0You might like to print out the responses you get to share with your doc.\u00a0\u00a0That way, s/he can correct or comment on any of the stuff we're saying here -- as it applies to your particulars.Take good care!",

    "question": "Ok i know your not a doctor but any adive would be so great.Last december my fasting blood was 107 and my doctor said that was \"perfect\". I thought fasting blood sugar has to be less than 100 i mean it says that on the america diabetes site. Thing was i was almost 300 lbs at that time and i didn't exercise. I found out a month later that my blood pressure was 150/100. I then started to lose weight by ONLY diet and i lost 42 lbs.I then had another blood test and im not sure if it was the right one but the \"glucose plasma\" was 88. Is glucose plasma the same as glucose and blood sugar level?I finally as of this month of november 2004 am starting to exercise but i feel like i did it too late, from january to september i ran a blood pressure of 150/100 although i did lose weight like i said but i know blood pressure is a risk for diabetes. Now my blood pressure is lower but not as low as i want it to be. Lately i have been getting symptoms like my eyes cant focus and im tired all the time, not sure if its my BP meds or maybe i do have diabetes.Is glucose plasma the same thing as blood sugar level?Researchers say that if you make your \"pre-diabetes\" go down to a normal level that you can prevent or \"delay\" the onset of T2. What do they mean by delay? What if i do lose all this weight and keep my BP normalized will that be enough to prevent or just delay??Info on me im a 19 year old latino male with only my grandfather who has diabetes in the immediate family. Im trying to change my life around and if i do get diagnoised it will ruin me.Thank you.",
