    "question": "Well I had my glucose test today.. never fun.. but I survived. Hopefully I won't hear anything bad on it. I'm a little nervous cuz diabetes runs in my family and I'm 27 my body isn't the same as with my DS. Fingers crossed. I also got wonderful news, I had a transvaginal u/s to check cervical length to make sure I'm not at risk for preterm labor (becuz of first pregnancy) and the doc said I am not even remotely at cause for concern. My baby is nice and high and my cervix is nice and long. That made me happy to hear. She is breech right now so I did get to see her little toes and it was awesome!! A perfect little foot =) I also signed my papers for my tubal. This mommy is all done having babies. Its bitter sweet but I don't think I could handle another pregnancy. I love my children but I am not enjoying this pregnancy much this time. I am just waiting for it to get done lol. I want my body back and my pretty little girl to hold. All in all it was a good appointment.",
