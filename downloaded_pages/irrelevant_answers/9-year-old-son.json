            "answer": "Hello,It is true that diabetes is an important cause of dizziness.The readings that you have given are definitely high for a 9 year old child.But measuring blood glucose with a glucometer can give false readings also.Best would be to get a blood sugar level;fasting(after overnight) as well as post prandial checked from a lab.The most confirmatory test is however Hb A1c blood tests.Pls get it done after consulting a pediatrician.If diabetes is ruled out then other causes of dizziness in children like lack of proper sleep or taking stress,anemia, infections,endocrine disorders like thyroid, adrenal glands, and pituitary gland disorders,electrolyte imbalance,dehydration,inner ear diseases and refractory changes in eye have to be probed.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how your son is doing.Kind regards.",
