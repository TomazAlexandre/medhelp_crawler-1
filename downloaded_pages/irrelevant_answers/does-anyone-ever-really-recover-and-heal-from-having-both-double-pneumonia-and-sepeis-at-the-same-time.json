            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You had a lot to contend with. There is a possibility that your heart, kidney, liver and pancreas are not functioning 100% and hence tests to determine their functional capacity should be done like glomerular filtration rate, blood urea and serum creatinine, liver function tests, pancreatic amylase and lipase, blood sugar fasting and after food etc. Thyroid function, hemoglobin, peripheral blood smear, serum iron level etc should also be assessed. Another possibility is sleep disturbances (like sleep apnea, imbalance of rapid eye and non rapid eye movement sleep etc.). You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, low Vit b12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Hope this helps. Take care!",
