I would not use that for contraception.Good luck!Dr B",

    "question": "Dear Dr,I am hoping you can advice me on this. I wanted to know the risk of pregnancy if the penis tip just enters the vagina for less than a second.I was plying with a girl and we agreed NOT to have sex, so there was no need for condom, though we were both naked. However, as soon as we started she sat on top of me and my penis tip ( like 1-2 inches)\u00a0\u00a0accidentally entered her vagina and I quickly withdrew it. That was the end of the play as we were very disappointed and afraid that we may have done something very stupid.We don't have emergency contraceptive her. So 8 hours later, I went to the pharmacist who prescribed some doses of logynon to be taken as emergency contraceptive. So, she took 10 tablets of the logynon ( red color) in 8 hours and 12 tablets again ( 10 red ones and two yellow ones) 12 hours later.1. The question is, can she get pregnant from this if there was some fluid on tip of the penis,\u00a0\u00a0We did not have any sex at all and no ejaculation before.2, Our main fear is that it was day 16.5 of her cycle (28 days cycle) and she may have just ovulated. Will this contraceptive still work assuming she just ovulated before this incident.3. Also, I learnt that pure vitamin C can be used to prevent implantation, is this true and should I use it just in case. I see the recommended dose on the internet is 6 gram a day for 5-10 days. An serious side effect if the takes vitamin at this dose for this short period\u00a0\u00a0She is expecting her period in 9 days.Here we can not handle any emergency should anything happen, please your help and advice will be appreciated, am already overwhelmed by anxiety.",
