            "answer": "Oh lord! Lol my first was 8.2 when she was born and I know they usually stick around same weight give/take a pound or so. What I'm really hoping is she say baby's getting to big lets induce so I can at least try a vaginal birth. I mean I've heard moms getting told they're taking baby via section and then turns out baby is average weight and not big at all. Ahh too much stress!! Lol",

    "question": "I had my final ultrasound Tuesday at 35+3 and though the tech can never really diagnose or make official calls and its up to the doc and other radiologist person to say but she mentioned baby girl is already 7lbs 2oz and said that's give/take 17oz (basically a whole other pound so she could be 6.2 and she could be 8.2 right now that's my range) and I'm kinda worried.Babies around now gain about a pound a week and even at the lowest, if I go until my due date, that's gonna be a really big baby if she keeps gaining weight and I'm worried this could mean higher chance of doc saying C-Section. I have gestational diabetes but I've kept my levels mostly in check with diet change and I feel like I'm starving and technically have only gained about 3-5lbs this whole pregnancy due to weight loss in the beginning and weight loss again during the diet change. I know that can cause higher weight babies so I'd assume that's why she's already so much bigger but I'm just worried.Ill find out today but I hate the stress before so was wondering what you ladies think?",
