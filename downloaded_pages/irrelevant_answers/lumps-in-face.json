            "answer": "The lumps might be a bacterial infection in your skin, similar to an infection like strep throat. I had those exact symptoms in college, and now have scars from it going untreated. The regular family Dr. gave me a topical liquid antibotic called Clindamycin-they were gone in like 2 weeks. The medicine does not stink, or burn, or leave a film on your skin. Hope this is your solution.",

    "question": "Hi,A few months ago I developed a hard lump right under my ear lobe, at the top of my jaw bone approximately 1/2 an inch wide. It is not painful, but it has an unpleasant inflammatory feeling like a numbness/tingling/itchiness that feels deep inside (not on the surface of the skin). It started with just a few days, but now it is constant. I have now developed another lump in my cheek, that I discovered just a week ago, and it has the same sensation.Any thoughts would be appreciated.Karen :)",
