            "answer": "Thanks very much everyone for the kind thoughts and prayers.As selma said I have been given the run around by my NL.I had one high HbAc1 blood result in 2009. I have had this blood test repeated every three months since and it has been normal but my NL just wont let it go.I had an appointment with her last month and she ordered a Glucose Tolerance Test witch came back normal.I was diagnosed in 2009 with a Motor/Sensory Axonal\u00a0\u00a0polyneuropathy witch is a common side effect of Diabetes and I guess this is why my NL was so focused on diabetes. I also have Vitiligo in both my hands witch has been ignored, all this started around the same time,On Thursday I noticed an abscess had developed on my right leg. I went to an on call GP near where I live and she was very concerned because she believed the skin in the area was \"breaking down\" so she sent me off to hospital for investigation.In hospital I met a different NL. He is pretty sure I have Neurochemical Segmental Vitilligo. He is going to investigate it further.The NL I spoke to in hospital\u00a0\u00a0also discussed the risks to people with CM/SM getting cuts/burns.because due to of decreased feeling of pain or temperature you may not be aware of same. It is also very important to get any cuts/burns checked by a doctor because of the risk of infection and ulceration. Skin Ulcers can often be painless in Syringomyelia.",
