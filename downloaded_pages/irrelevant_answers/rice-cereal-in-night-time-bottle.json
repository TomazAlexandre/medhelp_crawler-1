Would you feed a toddler or older child rice just to fill him up?It is very normal for a 4 month old to wake once or twice during the night. Some wake more frequently, and some don't wake at all.",

I am also a first time mom, and my son who is still 4 and half months old wakes up twice during the night for feeding, and I think is pretty much normal.About the food and cereal I know lot of new moms wants to start them right away but I consider we are not in any type of rush, for now all what he needs is breastmilk/ formula which I am supplementing due to my low milk supply.Planning to start him on solid once he turns around 6 months of age, according to all the data I have read by introducing solids later on you decrease the risks of food allergies, obesity and diabetes in your little one.",
