            "answer": "Well two things stand out - you were last examined about 3 months ago and you are seeing \"stars\" that fade away, which I'm not exactly sure I understand completely.\u00a0\u00a0All I can say is that since you are seeing a new problem, you should make an appointment to see your ophthalmologist again for another dilated exam.\u00a0\u00a0I can' t tell if\u00a0\u00a0you are just noticing floaters in a unique way, whether you have vitreous traction and flashes, or some variant of visual migraines, or some other type of transient visual obscurations that cannot be explained.\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck.MJK MD",

    "question": "1 week ago I began seeing what appear to be tiny stars that fade out and do not move. I have had floaters for over 3 years. I have gone to 3 different opthomologists for my floaters and all have said that my vision is fine and that they are normal. I have type II diabetes. They have all said that I don't have glaucoma or any signs of diabetic retinopathy. I am 33 years old.This last episode of \"seeing stars\" has concerned me, though.In October of 2007, I had what my opthomologist called an \"optic migraine\" but haven't had one since. I have had no vision loss, in fact my vision is almost 20/20, but I am still worried about these stars. My next follow up with my opthomologist is in March. Should I be concerned?",
