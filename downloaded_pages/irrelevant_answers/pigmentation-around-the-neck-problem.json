            "answer": "Hello,From the symptoms one important possibility is of acanthosis nigricans. It presents as symmetrical, hyperpigmented, velvety plaques mostly in the folds of skin. It is not itchy and is characterized by hyperpigmentation. My sincere advice is to consult a dermatologist. Biopsy skin may be done to confirm the diagnosis.I hope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts. Kind regards.",

    "question": "Dear Doctor's',Let me start by introducing myself. My name is Ahmed, I have a strong middle eastern background, which means i have olive/brown skin. I'm 23 years old, and ever since I was young, 5-6 years old according to my parents, my neck, and ONLY the neck, started to turn very very dark. From the beard line on near the neck to the neck part broder if you r wearing a neck tight t-shirt.I've seen alot of dermatologists, if i spelled it right, in few middle eastern countries and in Australia. I have tried so many different lotions for the last 12-15 years. peels/bleech/laser treatments (5+ treatments) and nothing worked. All I know is its a pigmentation problem I have, most dermatalogists agreed on that.I also seeked methods to hide this problem. This means I tried to use makeup/concealers/microskin paint. all were failures, eaither it was so hard to match my skin, due to massive difference colour tone between my neck and face, or it was hard to put on my neck and it would rub off easily. This darkened skin is very obvious. my skin tone from a scale 1-10 is 3. but my neck is 8 or 9.more details about myself:I'm skinny/slim buid 80 kilos / 1.83m. hardly any fat on my body. I remember once a doctor told me when i was yound, it might be early signs of diabetes. As my mother do have diabetes and it runs in the family. However i did check that I was clean.3-4 years ago I started to do alot of cardio, maybe thats why im becoming very skinny lol, but im very clean and aware of proper hygiene. I clean my skin/body on a daily basis.Yes I did spend most of my life in a middle eastern country called 'Oman' . Oman is a very hot and sunny country, but this doesnt really explain my neck darkness whereas my face/arms/legs are the same skin colour as the rest of my body.I was told about lotions that remove pigmentation from skin that has 'Monobenzone'. Its used by vititiligo. it sometimes work and sometimes cause other side effects, according from what I read on the net. I know the net is a bad source of information sometimes.Can someone tell me about this solution. As this might be my last solution/hope for me...sorry for writing alot of details. I just wanted to clear everything and make sure you guys do understand my situation. I'm not seeking to be white/dark/brown/grey. Or change who am I. I'm just seeking proper skin colour tone between all my body. Its hard for me. It has hurt my social life alot and my self-confidence.Thank you for ur help in advance.Ahmed",
