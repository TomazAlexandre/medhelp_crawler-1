            "answer": "It could be an early sign of repetitive strain injury or carpal tunnel. The arms shaking may be due to not working out with your arms? Also, if you are leaning on your wrists when sitting back it may be causing the carpal tunnel nerve to be aggravated. The new office may be causing you to sit in a different position and pinching a nerve or tightening muscles in your neck. Try another chair or better posture. See if that doesn't help. If there is someone in your HR or safety etc. that can help with posture you may call them for a demo.mkh9",

    "question": "For the last 9 weeks, I've experienced intermittent symptoms that my doctor hasn't been able to solve. Initially I had cravings for sugar and weakness - was tested for Diabetes etc , but bloods were normal. This has subsided to very subtle bouts. However, I also have (usually on my right hand and wrist a burning sensation. No redness, and it's never actually painful, just 'there'.It tends to stop in the evenings and return mid morning. I also have suffered with some neck /upper back aches. Dr asked if I was stressed - no, I don't think. I love my job and enjoy my workign day. I had changed offices too and felt I was getting a pain across my shoulders - wondered if this may have been the cause of the burning sensation?ThanksRichard",
