            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Bad odor in the armpit area can be due to excessive sweating, adrenal hormone problems or metabolic disorders like diabetes. Hyperthyroidism can cause excessive sweating. You and your son should test for both diabetes and thyroid problems. It will be good to incorporate adrenal gland hormone assessment too.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage without examining. Please consult an Endocrine specialist or internal medicine specialist for this. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

It's a sickly smeall that seems to follow me around now. I've also started to get more spots. Could it be hormonal?Would it be silly to go to m GP about this?",
