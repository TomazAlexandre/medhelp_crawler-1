            "answer": "Dear Mike,i am simply a diabetic answering questions from my experiences. i am on an insulin pump which you may\u00a0\u00a0want to consider as you can program different basal rates throughouut the day. Basal rates is the background insulin to control glucose released by the liver all day long. But other than what the other doctor recommended of taking it in the evening i'm not sure what else to try. You may also want to check your blood sugar at 3AM and see if it only rises between then and 7AM when many diabetics release more sugar because of the release of many different hormones at this time of day. Hope this helps, bret.",

            "answer": "Have you asked your doctors about the insulin pump. It allows you to set a basal rate of insulin using fast acting insulins (Humalog) for very specific time periods. This will allow you to adjust dosages based on your very specific needs. I have had great success using it. Prior to using the pump I also had difficult time with overnight and morning blood glucose levels. My last A1C was 5.9 it really workds!!!",

            "answer": "Hi Everyone,I've been a type one diabetic for 9 years now...The last year has been very stressful for me, so i am wondering how stress affects diabetes. My blood sugars are out of whack and it just seems to be impossible to get them back to normal! I have just started taking glargine/lantus...but the control is still bad. Also, for those that have the pump...how is it and how has it affected your life style?",

    "question": "I am a Type 1 diabetic patient and had this condition for the past 7 years.\u00a0\u00a0I have just switched from Mixtard/Actrapid to Lantus/Actrapid 3 days ago due to very poor blood sugar control at night and in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0The current dosage of Lantus is 15 units in the morning with additional 15 units of Actrapic before evety meal i.e. breakfast, lunch and dinner.Blood sugar level in the morning shoots up to 15-16mmol (fasting), by noon it will remain at 9-12mmol (before lunch) and will gradually comes down to 4-5mmol before dinner.After dinner, blood glucose level will again shoot up to 10-12mmol (2 hours after meal) and will come down to 4-5mmol at 3am and then shot up again to 12-15mmol at 8am in the morning (fasting).I am not sure what actually happens and this has been going on for sometime probably a year or so even before switching to Lantus.Any help is appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0I have been to a few specialist but the doctor advise me to change the Lantus injection in the morning to evening and maintain the current insulin dosage.I am a little worry now since my HbA1c level had increased from 7.0 to 9.4 recently.\u00a0\u00a0My kidney is also not funtioning well with some albumim leaking in the 24hours urine test.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor has prescribed ace inhibitor to control the protien leak and I am hoping it will help.Regards,Mike",
