            "answer": "I am a physician that is board cert.in family practice with special focus on anti-aging medicine and barriatric medicine (a subspecialty on weight management).\u00a0\u00a0I really have reservations about using HCG solely for weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0HCG is major hormone produced by your body.\u00a0\u00a0As you get older, the levels decrease.\u00a0\u00a0It is used off-label to help increase energy, help with bone density, and lean muscle mass.\u00a0\u00a0It is used along with other hormones and supplements.\u00a0\u00a0You also have to excercise to get benefit of developing more lean muscle.\u00a0\u00a0I measure baseline IGF-1 level and monitor regularly.\u00a0\u00a0To be effective, injections are done Daily.\u00a0\u00a0The cost of the medicine is about $300-$600 per month depending on the dose.\u00a0\u00a0It does Not cause cancer, but since the hormone promotes growth, you and your physician should be comfortable that you currently do not have any active cancer.I have seen weight loss clinics promoting HCG shots at a relatively cheap price once a week.\u00a0\u00a0Assuming that this is the Real hcg medicine, it is probably a low dose.\u00a0\u00a0Also, weekly shots are in my opinion useless.I have been to numerous lectures, seminars on weight loss, and spoken to well respected physicians in the field.\u00a0\u00a0None are promoting Hcg as the weight loss solution.\u00a0\u00a0If your BMI is over 30, or 27 with other health problems like high blood pressure, diabetes, then appetite supressants like phentermine\u00a0\u00a0are a better choice.\u00a0\u00a0But should also be combined with a more comprehensive diet and activity modification to be a more long term success.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps.Dr. JL",

            "answer": "Hi,I am thinking that maybe the doctor is confusing HCG injections with HGH injections. Just a thought. HGH stands for Human Growth Hormone and it meets the criteria regarding some of the things for which it is helpful as noted in the doctor's post. And, as far as I understand, yes, HGH would not be used only for weight loss...and, yes, they are expensive. The other product, HCG comes from waste by-products from pregnant women. I am just beginning to study this, so I hope I have that exactly right...I believe it is extracted from the urine and maybe the Placenta, but I am not sure about that...I asked two doctors about this and right away they thought I was asking about HGH...so, it is often mixed up.Pregnant women have a very high count of HCG in their systems...and, it is used in fertility clinics. It is used as a weight loss aid off label and it is not something that can be patented, so it is kind of a well kept secret. You have to really research this to understand how it helps with weight loss..in conjunction with a low calorie diet. It effects the hypothalmus. It is interesting research, actually.Try the alternative forum on this weight loss site....or google Yahoo HCG for TONS of information at one of the health groups.Good luck!M",
