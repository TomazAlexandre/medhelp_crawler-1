            "answer": "Hello,Upper right abdominal pain can be caused by biliary colic, cholecystitis (inflammation of gall bladder), irritable bowel syndrome, hepatitis(inflammation of the liver), kidney stones, pneumonia, musculoskeletal pain,lower rib fracture and malignancy.In your case, gall bladder disease and irritable bowel syndrome need to be ruled out. Get an ultrasound and a HIDA scan of the gall bladder done. Chronic diarrhea can be due to irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, crohn\u2019s disease, malabsorption syndromes, pancreatic diseases, diabetes, hyperthyroidism etc. Since you frequent urination also, get the diabetes status checked by glycosylated hemoglobin which will reflect over all glucose control in pats 3 months. Uncontrolled diabetes could be cause of frequent urination and diarrhea.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
