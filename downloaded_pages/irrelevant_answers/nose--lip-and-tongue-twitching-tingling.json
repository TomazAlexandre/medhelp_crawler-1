            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!It is difficult to comment really without examination. Yes, stress can be the cause. However diabetes mellitus is a likely cause for head and tongue tingling. It could also be due to nerve compression very high up in the cervical vertebra. Excess alcohol intake, partial seizures and low calcium levels all cause head and tongue tingling. Wisdom tooth is another cause. It could also be due to allergy to some food item.I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes or hypothyroidism can also be the cause.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
