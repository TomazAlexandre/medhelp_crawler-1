            "answer": "I know how you feel in a way,I've only been diagnosed not even for two years, and at the beginning I did pretty well with my blood sugars and everything. But then when I hit fifteen I started to skip injections so my blood would go really really high, and I'd develop ketones and lose weight as a result. I think they're calling it 'diabulimia', and mostly just happens with young women with type one diabetes.I started to get blurry vision which can lead to diabetes complications (eye disease?) and realized how stupid I was being and how this could really affect me in the long run. Sometimes life would get hard and I just wouldn't want to deal with diabetes, but in the end it's really worth it to take care.I also have a sister with an eating disorder, so helping her through recovery has really helped motivate me in a way too.I hope this helped in even a small way :]",

            "answer": "Wow. You sound like me in many ways. I am 36 and have had type 1 for 11 years now. I suffered from bullemia and anorexia in highschool, and to this day it still haunts me. It has helped me though in monitoring carbs. But I am much healthier now. In a way, type 1 hit me with the reality of needing to look after myself, to love myself. I am the only one who can control what I do.I am an obsessive exerciser also. (type A personality, typical Virgo!) I road bicycle competitively and when I am not biking, I am running at the gym.\u00a0\u00a0I started the pump about a year ago and it allows me so much more freedom, eliminating 90% of my lows while exercising.You obviously have a lot of self discipline and that is key. The obsessiveness is the problem and can easily get out of control, but by being aware, you are on the right track.I try to eat lower carbs, high fiber, and high protein. My endocrinologist loves me and I am very proud of my accomplishments. I hold my head high now when I tell people I am type 1! Before I was embarrased. If you aren't on the pump, seriously consider it. Especially for people who are seriously active, it is the best thing going if properly monitored.I hope this helps!\u00a0\u00a0:)",
