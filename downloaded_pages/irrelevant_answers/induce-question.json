I am trYing for a v bac this time.\u00a0\u00a0Unless there is a medical reason I do not suggest or condone getting induced.\u00a0\u00a0Increases chances of having csection unnecessarily and done people think the medicine could increase risk of autism.\u00a0\u00a0This is not proved however.\u00a0\u00a0Natural is always best when Possible.",
