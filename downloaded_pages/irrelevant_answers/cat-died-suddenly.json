            "answer": "This sounds exactly like our situation today.I believe my cat Pepe is somewhere between 13 - 16 years old.She seemed fine yesterday and every day before, but this morning when I went to feed her and her sister Lily, she just looked at her plate dazed. She tried to meow, but it came out as more or less a squeak sound. She did this a few times... sounded like she was trying hard to meow but had lost her voice.\u00a0\u00a0Pepe is normally the greedy eater, eating both hers and Lily's plate.\u00a0\u00a0Today she wanted nothing. She tried to lick some of it.. then gave up.\u00a0\u00a0I felt bad b/c I had to leave for work and am worried that i'll come home to her passed away in the corner somewhere.She looks so skinny these days, her fur has lost all its luster - I attributed this to her age - but then you (debodun) mentioned the matted fur..\u00a0\u00a0we've been dealing with that for about a year, maybe two now.\u00a0\u00a0I just figured it was a luster loss.. and she had to be brushed more often - which I'm ashamed to say, i hadn't been after having my first child.. I just was so busy.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, Lily was getting some matted fur clumps on her back, and she's much younger than Pepe - and a long hair..\u00a0\u00a0So really, i just thought it was b/c i wasn't brushing them.\u00a0\u00a0No i have to wonder ...She's been pooping directly outside of the box for two years now. She'll pee in the box though.\u00a0\u00a0I've changed the type of liter, box, location.. nothing helps.I'm going home during my lunch break to check on her.. crossing my fingers that she's ok.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm praying that she's not going to go thru a traumatic experience - vet, shots, pills, etc..\u00a0\u00a0and that she'll just curl up in the corner and let herself go.:-(",

            "answer": "After I posted my response the other day, I went to check on my kitty.. she was still doing very bad. I ended up taking her to the vet..and that was it.\u00a0\u00a0Doc said her liver was inflammed almost three times its normal size, that she was seriously diabetic, dehydrated and her heart was flat shaped. He said there was definitely no 50-50 shot for her, that even if he could get IV fluids in her to get her hydrated (she's so fiesty she likely wouldn't handle the IV), that we'd have to give her insulin shots twice a day for the diabetes (another no go), and then if all that gets managed.. well, he said her liver was shot.. and with her age and all, there was slim hope.She's buried in the yard....Worst day ever.And interesting note, which i was not aware of - he told me that the dry food the kitties eat are processed with grain, which brings on the diabetes if they have too much.He said its always best to give them wet food.Kitty #2 had the dry food taken away.. I feel like it was my fault the first kitty ended up this way.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know more about this issue with the dry food?",

    "question": "I had a 19 year old cat (spayed female) and she appeared fine up to the day she went to the big catnip patch in the sky. I have 3 other cats and I thought it unusual that she didn't appear interested in eating that morning when I fed the others. She usually ate quite heartily. I brought her over to the food dish, but she just stared at it looking dazed, and when she walked away, it seemed like one of her hind legs was turned in a little with a slight limp. I had to leave for work, but thought that if she didn't improve, I'd have to take her to my vet. However, when I came home, she had already passed. It must have been shortly after I left, because she was cold and rigor had set in.\u00a0\u00a0The last time she was at the vet was in July 2009 and nothing unusual was mentioned about her condition. However, I noticed the last few months that her undercoat seemed really thick and matted - so much so that I had a really difficult time combing her. I would comb and comb to try to get the matted fur out, but in a few days it seemed just as matted. I didn't have a necropsy done, but was curious what could have been wrong with her.",
