            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Pins and needles sensation in hands and feet raises the suspicion of peripheral neuropathy. It is important for you to get tested for diabetes and B12 deficiency. The symptoms of head fullness can be due to ear infections, and sinusitis, but these have already been ruled out in your case. Please also get your BP checked.I would suggest you to make sure you eat your meals on time, and maintain hydration. Also you can take B complex supplements and see if it helps!",

            "answer": "thank you for your response, however the possibility of an inner ear infection hasnt been ruled out as yet. I am due to see an ENT Doctor next week, as i have a dull ache in my left ear that never seems to go away. i am still unclear if the numbness in my face can be connected to the problems with my ear. could you elaborate on this please? thanks",

    "question": "I am 43 years old. Approx 3-4 months ago i experienced a bout of dizziness that i can only explain as a severe head rush feeling. These episodes have become far frequent since- and on a bad day this can happen approx 10-15 times ( but milder than the first one ) i have also developed a numbness and feeling of pressure building up in the right side of my face and have almost constant pins and needles in both hands, legs and feet. I have suffered in the past with ear infections and have constant crackling in both ears. The Hospital fitted grommits but these proved to be ineffective. I am unsure if the symptoms are connected to a problem with my inner ear or something more serious. I have had a clear MIR scan and tests for thyroid problems all proved inconclusive so any advice would be appreciated.",
