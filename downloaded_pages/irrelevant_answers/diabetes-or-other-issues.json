            "answer": "C-reactive protein I found out recently is a measure of inflammation.\u00a0\u00a0It can also signify possible inflammation in the heart or heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0I have lupus and diabetes, and I have very high C-reactive protein.\u00a0\u00a0I think it's not too much of an issue, if you can get it down.\u00a0\u00a0It's when it stays high for long periods of time that it gets to be a concern.\u00a0\u00a0Over 3.0 is considered very high risk.\u00a0\u00a0Mine is close to 3.0, mine is like 2.8 or something like that.\u00a0\u00a0I had to go in for an echocardiogram.\u00a0\u00a0I have not been keeping my lupus under control.\u00a0\u00a0Actually, I was recently rediagnosed with it, after many years of doctors calling it other things like fibromyalgia, mixed connective tissue disease and connective tissue disease not specified.\u00a0\u00a0Anyways, just ask your doctor about the arthritis thing.\u00a0\u00a0C-reactive protein elevated can signify other things than heart, with inflammation in your body.\u00a0\u00a0That's what my doctor found out and is trying to get my inflammation under control.\u00a0\u00a0Just don't stress out too much, just focus on finding out if your heart is okay and getting that number down.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe you need an anti-inflammatory?The other stuff, I am not familiar with, sorry.",

            "answer": "Hello,I will attempt to offer you a little insight as to the results of your lab results. First of all testing for AST is usually used to detect liver damage. A standard reference range is not available for this test because reference values are dependent on many factors. Your lab report should include the specific reference range for your test.The ALT test detects liver injury. A standard reference range is not available for this test. Because reference values are dependent on many factors. Your lab report should include the specific reference range for your test. It sounds as if I am repeating myself albeit strictly out of necessity.The CRP test is sometimes used in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and some forms of arthritis and autoimmune diseases to assess how active the inflammation is and to monitor the treatment. Because CRP increases in cases of inflammation, the test is ordered when acute inflammation is a risk (such as from an infection after surgery) or suspected based on patient symptoms. It is also ordered to help evaluate conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. When your results fall below 10 mg/L, you no longer have clinically active inflammation.The blood glucose test is ordered to measure the amount of glucose in the blood right at the time of sample collection. It is preferable to measure the Blood Glucose level after fasting for at least 8 hours when testing as a diagnostic tool. 126 mg/dL and above on more than one testing occasion can be an indicator of Diabetes.With all of this in mind I would think that your concern should be directed towards the Blood Glucose Level test results. Diabetes should be taken very seriously. I hope that I have shed a little light upon your results and please feel free to consult me if you need additional information or simply need a sounding board.Sincerely,JeepManDan",

    "question": "I am a 56yr. old female. The only med I've taken for years is to regulate thyroid. I just received the lab report from my recent doc visit. Four of my numbers are out of range and I want to know what they might indicate. I knew I wasn't feeling well, but was thinking I needed a cardiologist because of the blood pressure or maybe my thyroid was off. Arthritis pain has been an issue. Now, I'm worried about the possiblity of Diabetes. Which direction should earn my greatest concern...just judging from these levels...Glucose in 8/06 was 111\u00a0\u00a0as of this week, it is 155.\u00a0\u00a0AST was 27 but now 69\u00a0\u00a0ALT was 35 but now 85. The C-Reactive Protein number is 1.23 (in range is <0.80)All my other numbers are in range.\u00a0\u00a0After my doc visit the other day, I started a blood pressure pill with a diuretic, Maxide....and Arthrotec for arthritis pain. This lab work was taken prior to those meds. Can you guide me and also tell me where the red flags are and why? Thank you.",
