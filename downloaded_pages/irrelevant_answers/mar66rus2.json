            "answer": "hi i also have pcos been ttc for a year now the metformin is good because i gained about 40lbs when i found out i had it and now i have lost a lot of weight so thats good the only thing is that clomid has not done anything for me. Everyone is different and meds work differently some fast others slow. I was not ovulating for a while and didn't even know so had to take provera but after a while of taking meds ur system will regulate. Good luck to u.",

            "answer": "I don't really have any advice on the OPK's from any experience of mine.\u00a0\u00a0They were a PITA for me.\u00a0\u00a0However, DH's niece has PCOS and had post OPK's, but then went for an u/s and there was nothing there.\u00a0\u00a0So yes, it can give you a false positive.As for the Metaformin, no, you do not need AF to start it.\u00a0\u00a0The Clomid yes, but Metaformin is a medication that treats diabetes and sugar/insulin problems.\u00a0\u00a0 I don't know why they told you that.\u00a0\u00a0Like I said, you have build up on the dosage, so the sooner the better :)Hope this helps....let me know if you have any other questions.April",

    "question": "I really appreciated your post to me about the PCOS. I had a couple more questions if you have the time. The doc said that it may not be a big deal because I show none of the symptoms. However, this month I have had postive OPK's for 4 days. To me, this means that my LH level is elevated, I know this is a symptom of PCOS. I am wondering if this means I will not ovulate, do you know anything about this?Also, I am mid-cycle, should they start me on the Metaformin now? They are telling me I have to wait until AF starts which didnt make sense to me.Again thank you so much, I am a chronic worrier and your post really made me feel better\u00a0\u00a0: )Stacie",
