            "answer": "With your blood sugars running in the 400's, you need better control of your sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Schedule an appointment with your PCP to modify your insulin dose, or schedule a referral to an endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0Blood sugars should be below 200 after meals.Regarding your GI symptoms, one of the considerations would be gastroparesis (i.e. delayed gastric emptying).\u00a0\u00a0This is a condition that is associated with diabetes - especially uncontrolled diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Before doing further tests on the liver and pancreas, I would suggest a gastric emptying scan.\u00a0\u00a0If gastroparesis is present - this can certainly present with nausea and bloating.\u00a0\u00a0Drugs such as reglan, domperidone, cisapride, and erythromycin can be tried if this is the case.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

    "question": "I'm a female 52 yrs. old with recurent bowel blockage & diabete's.My bl.sugars were stable & I was only taking meds until last wk. In Feb. I had bladder surgery, my stomach was getting very lg. and I thiught it was just from the surgery, needless to say, it got larger(upper abdomen/liver area.)I started having severe liver pain.Along w/this pain I also have shoulder pain & pain just under shoulder blade area rght. side.I saw my GP & several test were taken.The outcome of the endocopy was red dots found in the lower stomach which he said was H-Pylori infection.I've been on antibiotics for 2 wks. now. I still have the liver pain & tirdness problems. My liver on the x-rays showed that it was swollen & a fatty liver. I had a liver biopsy back in 1986 which showed fatty liver then. My liver ensyme's are on the high side still. My bl. sugars have been running 400. Once I take my insulin and eat,instead of going down they go up. I've also had bile in the urine & overall feel crappy.If I sit for a period of time I have the pain because everything in the tummy area gets pushed up. I was on a diet but since this in the past few months,I had to get new cloths as I was wearing a 14 and am now in a 20. I am so swollen in that area. Please tell me if there may be an underlying problem that they can't find. I'm tired of being irratable & sick !! I've been off work for the past 2 weeks and I'm not sure I can go back with these problems because it's hard to sit for so long and be pain free.The Gastrologist said he found a small hiatal hernia (which doesn't give me any heartburn or problems)Being diabetic I always watch what I eat. The Dr. says I'm not gaining weight in fact I'm losing it. My appetite is not so good lately but I know I must eat.My sugars are what concerns me. Why hasn't any of the meds worked. The insulin does the same, makes them go up higher after eating.Should I insist that cancer bllod work be taken? What other tests can be done on the liver & pancreas. I've had several surgeries, including gallbladder. Could all this be coming from adhessions?And is there something they can do to test for that? My symptons are as follows:1.Severe pain in the liver area and into back under shoulder blade(rght. side)2.Pale stools3.Nausea without vomiting4.Tiredness5.Pain when sitting because of severe swelling in stomach area6.Bloating of face,hands,feet with redness in face and neckMedications:1.Synthroid 100 mg.1 a day2.Diovan Hct.160/25 mg. 1 ea. day3.Tricor 160 mg. 1 ea. day4.Novolog mix 70/30 30 units am./ 20 units pm.5.Valtrex 1gm. 1/2 each dayThe symptons were there long after these meds. And I've not ever had a problem with any of them.Please help with any suggestions you may have.Thank-you, Emarejeff",
