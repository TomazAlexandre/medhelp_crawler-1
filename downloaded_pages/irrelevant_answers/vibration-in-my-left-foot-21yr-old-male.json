I told my fiance about it and he said it probably from the jogging.\u00a0\u00a0I do not think that is it. I do not know if its neruological or not, but I would like some answers.\u00a0\u00a0We all have things that happen to us that we cannot explain, but this is really annoying.If anyone finds out anything from their doctor's please post it, so we could hopefully have some answers.",

            "answer": "Try elevating your foot and flexing it (bringing your toes up so that your leg and foot form a 90 degree angle) when you feel the tingling, and it should stop. It is probably a nerve damage issue.",

    "question": "I'm a 21 yr old male. No diabetes. A bit inactive but within normal BMI.I've been suffering from a dull-aching pain in my left foot for 6 months. I have partial pes planus in my left foot. I had been wearing an uncomfortable unpadded pair of shoes by the time I got this situation. X-ray on foot is unremarkable. Pain is there when the foot touch a surface. When it's off, there's no pain.2 months ago, a new symptom came up. It's a feeling as if the foot is vibrating. Not tingling, not electrical, and not throbbing (i.e. not synchronous with pulse). It's there most of the time that I keep moving my foot and switching positions.I've tried applying ice packs daily. Have been doing this for a month or a bit more, but there's no effect.I suspect either:1. Plantar fasciitis2. Peripheral vascular disease3. Tumor?Could anybody enlighten me about this? Thanks.",
