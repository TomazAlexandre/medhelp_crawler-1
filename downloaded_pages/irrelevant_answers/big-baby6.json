            "answer": "My best advice is to NEVER listen to what friends,colleagues and strangers say..they are not experts and even if they may have been pregnant and have a few kids, doesn't mean they KNOW what is normal for you and not.Some girls make large babies, some small.. it is just like when you look around.. some people are tall, some short, some fat, some skinny..As long as you are eating healthy and your doctor is happy with your results you should have no reason to worry.If you still are worried though, ask your doctor if you can be tested for Gestational Diabetes in week 26.You'll not be able to test earlier unfortunately due to hormone levels.It could be that your body fails to produce enough insulin and sends too much sugar to your baby -and then your baby grows too much.But just eat healthy and you should have no reason to worry.Good luck!",
