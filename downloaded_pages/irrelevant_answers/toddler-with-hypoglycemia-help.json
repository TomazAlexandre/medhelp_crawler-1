            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter was 7 when she was diagnosed with diabetes, so I haven't dealt specifically with toddler issues, although I know many people who are.\u00a0\u00a0It's definitely not an easy thing to deal with.\u00a0\u00a0Hypoglycemia is a little different from diabetes in how it's treated, so I apologize in advance if I confuse the two.I think you're asking two separate questions here, at least that's how I'll address them.\u00a0\u00a0The first is about how to handle managing the hypoglycemia of a toddler that isn't able to communicate or recognize lows.\u00a0\u00a0The second is to be able to explain what happened in that particular incident.How often do you test blood sugars?\u00a0\u00a0I presume you test prior to going to bed.\u00a0\u00a0Do you test in the middle of the night?\u00a0\u00a0Overnights are the most concerning times because there isn't eye-on the child all time.\u00a0\u00a0A couple extra tests a night until you are sure she isn't going to go low and would be an excellent way to prevent problems.\u00a0\u00a0It really sucks as a parent to not have interrupted sleep, but it's much better than the alternative of spending the day in the ER, or worse.\u00a0\u00a0Another alternative that is becoming more available is a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM).\u00a0\u00a0It is a monitor that has sensors which go under the skin and test blood sugars every 5 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0It gives alarm warmings when the person goes high and especially when the person is going low.\u00a0\u00a0It's not inexpensive, startup costs are about a thousand dollars, and it's a couple hundred for supplies every month, but many insurance companies are covering CGM and supplies.\u00a0\u00a0It can give great information about trends and whether or not what you are using for ratios and correction factors are correct.\u00a0\u00a0Most importantly, it warns of lows long before they cause seizures.\u00a0\u00a0I think that a hypoglycemic can be approved for a CGM, but I don't know for sure.\u00a0\u00a0It's definitely worth checking into, if you're interested.As for the second question about what happened in that particular incident, it's important to know that when a hypoglycemic (or a diabetic) has a seizure, it often takes many hours, and even a day or two, for the person to fully recover.\u00a0\u00a0They will show symptoms like they aren't quite right for a while, because it takes a bit for the glucose to get back into the system and get things \"woken back up\", so to speak.\u00a0\u00a0So for her to not be herself is completely expected.Then there are the two lows, one in the middle of the night and one the next day.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of things can cause blood sugars to go low.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise causes the body to use glucose without needing insulin, and lots of exercise can cause the body to use extra glucose for hours after the exercise is done.\u00a0\u00a0Swimming, for example, causes my daughter's blood sugar to srop like a rock.\u00a0\u00a0Stress can cause blood sugars to go high as well, and conversely, excitement or anxiety can cause them to go low.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure how much anxiety a toddler can have, but exercise and excitement are regular occurances, I'm sure.\u00a0\u00a0On days that are more active than usual, it would be a good thing to check more often, such as 2 hours and 5 hours after the exercise is over, even if it's during the day, and particularly prior to the next meal.Does this help?",

            "answer": "I have a four year old and I have been dealing with her hypogycemia since she was 28 months.\u00a0\u00a0It started out just like your story and it has not gotten any better.\u00a0\u00a0She has taken every test possible and they can't figure out what is wrong with her.\u00a0\u00a0She is not diabetic, however she tends to go high after a low.\u00a0\u00a0I am so frustrated and do not know what to do.\u00a0\u00a0We did all of the genetic testing and it came back normal. She just finished the 72 hour continueous glucose monitor, but have not recieved the results.\u00a0\u00a0We are working with a team of endocrinologists at a local Children's hospital.\u00a0\u00a0I am so happy that I have found this forum because I feel so alone in this.",

    "question": "hi-i am so new to this but need help-after a normal day i put my 19mo old to bed-she awoke at 4am screaming-i picked her up and she took a mild seizure then became nonresponsive. after 911 she was at childrens ER where they discovered a BS of 35. they had already adm adavan for seizure possibilty, after fluids she came around in about an hour then was discharged. she was not herself and we went back and was admitted. she was monitored for 24 then discharged. we saw ped next day who was very not happy with the how the situation was addressed and repeated this was NOT normal-she sched us with the ped endo dept and they readmitted us. a 20hr challenge fast was performed and her BS dropped to 40 in the 14th hr. they continued and adm glucagon then did the challenge test. results arent in. what does this sound like it could be-i mean i know its hypoglycemia but the results will show WHY and i am so nervous of WHY this happened. shes home now and i have a glucometer and feed her every 3 hours. was this normal protocol? i am so worriedthank u",
