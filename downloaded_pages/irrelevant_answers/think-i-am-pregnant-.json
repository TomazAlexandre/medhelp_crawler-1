            "answer": "As your youngest is 6 and your tubes got clamped in 2008, your son was born in 2009 a year after your tubes were clamped - is that correct?My maths aren't very good!If that is the case, and you had unprotected sex, then you may be pregnant.If you are tired all the time, you may be anaemic and that may be the reason that your menstrual cycle is not as it should be.Having swollen feet can sometimes be heart or kidney related.Feeling hungry more than normal can also be a symptom of diabetes.Spotting can also be that your hormones are out of balance.Every opportunity that you get, elevate your legs and feet, to drain the fluid away from your feet.\u00a0\u00a0Don't stop drinking water or fluids.\u00a0\u00a0Thinking about drinking less will not work, you actually to drink water.\u00a0\u00a02 litres a day is usually recommended, but more if you sweat a lot.\u00a0\u00a03 litres may be fine, but don't drink too much as it is just as dangerous as being dehydrated.Cut out or cut down on\u00a0\u00a0sugary, processed and junk foods and fizzy drinks.Eat more fresh fruit and veg, lean meat and fish.Make an appointment to see your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Tell him your symptoms so that he can take blood tests to check your iron and hormone levels.\u00a0\u00a0And of course a blood test for pregnancy if you are not sure.Your doctor may do a HbA1C test to check your sugar levels for signs of diabetes, or may refer you to have a glucose test.",
