            "answer": "My fiance compared me to a cow lol. When cows are pregnant, how much they eat in the third trimester determines how big the calf will be. So if the cow eats a lot, the calf will be big. My fiance told me he's going to limit how much I eat.I don't know if the same is true for humans. I know having gestational diabetes can cause a woman to have a big baby of she doesn't watch what she eats. Whether it's true or not, just eat healthy. That will regulate how much you gain. Try to cut back on bad carbs and bad fatty foods if you're eating a lot of those types of foods.",

    "question": "So I am over weight, I went from 125 to 190 and my son was 4 weeks early, and after he was born I went down to 145 and got up to 167 with my second pregnancy (that wasn't as bad but with my first I had a lot of health issues). With this one I went from 135 up to 187 (I was last weighed two weeks ago on this Friday, I go in again this Friday to see my.current weight.) I am 5'2\". Anyway so my question is, does how much I gain or what I eat affect my baby? Like will it make my baby gain weight?\u00a0\u00a0I've been told it wont but I kinda wonder cause my first was 9lbs at 4 weeks.early and I gained the most with him, with my second he was 5 days early and he weighed 8lbs 13ozs. Last time they measured this baby I weighed 167 and he weighed 3 lbs at 26 weeks gestation\u00a0\u00a0(I had three different Drs tell.me that) where this app said it was supposed to weigh less then 2 lbs. I am a little concerned that I'm causing my babies to be so big cause of how much I've gained",
