            "answer": "I found two case reports on CF patients who were taking isotretinoin (generic name for Accutane).\u00a0\u00a0In one case, the patient actually had both improvement in his acne and CF.\u00a0\u00a0Isotretinoin usually tends to dry out the skin and mucous membranes.\u00a0\u00a0The drug's side effect helped the patient in drying up some of the secretions, reducing the mucous plugging that contributed to his CF symptoms.In the other case, the patient actually developed night blindness after starting on a low dose (20 mg) isotretinoin.\u00a0\u00a0He had CF but liver problems as well.\u00a0\u00a0His vitamin A levels should have been monitored here.Here are some cases in which you should not use isotretinoin (this list is not comprehensive):liver problemshigh levels of vitamin A in the bloodhigh lipid (fat) levels in the bloodkidney problemsYou also want to weigh the risks and benefits of taking this drug with:osteoporosis or other bone disordersanorexiaa family history of diabetes*depression* (this drug can cause and worsen underlying depression)Your doctor and pharmacist should know more about this, though.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helped!",
