            "answer": "Hello,I'm not an MD, but if your \"new doc\" is not an endocrinologist, I'd encourage you to find one to review your records with.\u00a0\u00a0It is not uncommon for \"real diabetics\" to have a1c results that are normal -- it's great to achieve that result, especially when there are NOT a lot of hypoglycemic episodes \"balancing out\" high episodes.\u00a0\u00a0An a1c gives an average of blood glucose readings for ~3 months and there is not a test that gives us the range of glucose, tho' that'd be helpful, too.Your \"new docs\" comment seems quite odd to me.\u00a0\u00a0Your hard work to manage your diet and activity and meds are TERRIFIC and certainly are contributing to your good readings.Good luck --- do check in cuz there's likely be more info added to your interesting thread.",

            "answer": "Interesting.\u00a0\u00a0You do have alot of risk factors so your concern is warranted.\u00a0\u00a0The A1c test is a measure of control, not a diagnostic test, so it is very possible that the Metformin is controlling your blood sugar and that is why your A1c is good.\u00a0\u00a0Metformin is also used as a preventative for people with pre-diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You could discuss lowering your dose with a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Metformin is an insulin sensitizer and doesn't work on the food you eat like some other oral medications. There are no more risks of side effects from using Metformin if you do need or don't need but as with most medicine, there are side effects.\u00a0\u00a0You can also check www.gsk.com to find out more about Metformin. I hope this helps and have a wonderful day.",

            "answer": "Reminds me of my second visit with my first endocrinologist. At the first visit he told me he thought that I've had diabetes for several years and I didn't doubt that looking back at symptoms. I was diligient in keeping a record of my foods and achieved fantastic blood sugars. When I saw him 3 months later he said that I might not be diabtic after all. I thought the man was an idiot. He didn't look at what I was eating to achieve those numbers. At the time I was not yet on Metformin. I changed drs. Some drs. and people in general mix up controlling the disease from having the disease. It certainly is possible that you might be able to control your diabetes with diet and exercise alone and if he had said that it would be a different story. Seems like you might want to go down 1 pill and see what your Ha1c is. If still good, then you could go down 1 pill and again do your A1c. That is the only way that you will know if you need the metformin to control your diabetes. You shouldn't have to eat 200 g of carbs to prove to him that you have this disease.",

            "answer": "I am going through a similar situation. A year ago, I was put on metformin, because my sugar levels were too high. I started taking good care of myself through diet, exercise and the medication. My last test showed good numbers, but I still don\u00b4t know if it is the metformin helping those numbers.",

    "question": "I am a 49 year old woman.I was diagnosed w type 2 diabetes two years ago. Since that time I have been taking metformin 500x3per day w 'permission' to take a 4th if a social situation should require further food intake. I am VERY careful what I eat, and I exercise and get enough sleep and try to take good care of myself.I have a new doctor who ran all his own tests. I also have Hashis hypothyroid. My thyroid #s came back high so I have to lower them asap.But what has me concerned is that after seeing the HA1C result {0.054 (range 0.043-0.060) - dr is saying that he does not think I have diabetes at all, and he wants to withdraw the Metformin. (I am in Canada if that makes a dif in reults).My question is - isn't my A1C good BECAUSE I take the Metformin? I mean, isn't that what its for - to get back within range with blood sugars?Does this result say to YOU that I do not have diabetes after all?\u00a0\u00a0What will happen to me if he withdraws the Metformin?I should say that along w other risk factors, my family runs rampant w diabetes both Type 1 and Type 2 & there are members who have lost toes and limbs to it.I had gestational diabetes w both pregnancies & I also have high BP. My chol & triclycerides are good.If he withdraws the Metformin will my blood sugars go way up real quick? what will happen to me?Is he doing the right thing in taking me off Metformin? What are my risks if he does?What arguments might I present in favour of staying on Metformin?What risks are there if I take Metformin & DON'T need it?So confused!Thanks!",
