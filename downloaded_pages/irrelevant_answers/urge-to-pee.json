            "answer": "hi. I am having similar problems. at first it only occured when I was running. then I often had to pee. but now for the past years it happens to me in spite I\u00b4m not moving, I often pee every half hour and it is only a small amount. This is very frustrating because I can\u00b4t exercise without having the urge to pee. I have gone to see two doctors but nothing has made it better. I\u00b4ve taken pills, gone in surgery and tried to change my diet.. It doesn\u00b4t always hurt when I pee but it hurts sometimes. And after sex it sometimes hurts a lot.",
