One doctor sees something in the liver and the other sees it completely on the other side and not in the liver??@#$%^& She's complaining of A LOT of pain on her liver side. She even has to take pain killers at times. What can I expect. The final decision will be on Wed after another CT scan, so I'm just preparing for the worst. She is 65.
