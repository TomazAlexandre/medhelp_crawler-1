            "answer": "Normal blood sugar is 80-120 so if hers is 89 she is safe, and it's not that. how long has she felt tired? My sugar gets to low at times and i feel jittery inside and have to get sugar in me. Tired could be exhaustion, or could be her thyroid acting up. Does your mom have any medical problems? Sorry to say her symptoms could be alot of things and with no history to go by it's difficult to help much. Best advice i can give you is get her to the ER or her family DR if she is feeling so poorly.",

            "answer": "She may just have a virus that's going around. I would take her to the drs if she's not feeling her usual self and if you're not happy with their opinion get another one! She's your mum and if she's sick she should not be diagnosing herself either (not that she is) but this is where someone else needs to take charge and say \"Mum...I'm taking you to the drs until we know what's going on here!\" Good luck!",
