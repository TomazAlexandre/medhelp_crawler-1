            "answer": "I would be concerned of an underlying condition causing the Neuropathy as well.\u00a0\u00a0You are right to be concerned. Do you have a pinched nerve, Diabetes, some other autoimmune issue?\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any other symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0Any other pain that might warrant the VA to do an MRI like weakness or pain?\u00a0\u00a0By you saying that it happens when you lie in bed my first thought is a pinched nerve. But it is both sides? Left? Right?I am so sorry that you have to go through this.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe with some more information some one on this forum will have some answers for you.\u00a0\u00a0You are in my thoughts and prayers, I hope you feel better soon!!!\u00a0\u00a0This is a great place to vent and to get REALLY GOOD ADVICE from.Neurotin is good for nerve pain I have taken it for years although recently I was able to stop thank goodness it is one pill off my VERY long list.\u00a0\u00a0It really knocked me out made me very drowsy and I could only take it at night so it wasn't do me as much good as the doctors wanted.\u00a0\u00a0But I hear from several that it works very well.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your response to my problem. That was sweet of you to reply. Both of my feet go numb, especially at night while laying in bed. And while laying in bed, my feet get sharp, electric shock type pain that is high on the pain scale. Thank God it doesn't last more than a few minutes each time. I do get weakness in my feet and calves while standing or walking. And I lose my balance easily. I do not have diabetes but I am overweight. No pinched nerve. No autoimmune disease. Only fibromyalgia and intercystial cystitus.Because I take narcotic pain medication, I have a very hard time urinating. I can't seem to get the flow going and then I can't seem to empty it. Plus, the bladder issue makes it very painful for me if my bladder if full or if there is any urine in there at all I break out in painful blisters and have the need to urinate. This happens all night long, 6 or 7 times in 8 hrs, and each time I to go the bathroom I find myself sitting on the toilet for a very long time trying to empty the blader. Sometimes I am so tired that I fall asleep while sitting on the toilet. So this puts pressure on my legs and might add to the nerve damage and the numbness in my feet and lower legs.Well that's my story. I don't know what to do from here. As I mentioned this is all new for me and I'm not getting any help from my veteran doctor.Thanks again for your response.",

            "answer": "Do you have other insurance?\u00a0\u00a0I would definitely ask for an MRI.\u00a0\u00a0Still sounds like you may have a disc issue. You can do an inet search for a dermontome map 'not sure on spelling' and see if you pain follows any paths. Other than that utilise stretches and ice/heat therapy will help.\u00a0\u00a0I know when i first started gabapentin for about a month the soles of my feet and the palms of my hands were numb i was told it was a side effect and it went away after a month.I would look into another doctor or second opinion though.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck with your venture and keep me posted on how u r doing.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you find rhe help u need and a doctor that will listen...",

    "question": "My feet go numb while laying in bed and sometimes if I stand on them too long, my va doctor says I have peripheral neuropathy. He is a physician assistant through the veteran care. He says the only thing to do is put me on neurotin. I of course asked for a referral to the neurologist. He says the dr. of neurology does not take neuropathy patients. I complained to the patient advocate saying that I needed to see a specialist. She got the head doctor of some dept? to look at my chart and see if I should be refered for further care or not. The answer came back that neurotin was the only \"treatment\" for neuropathy. I read online that the doctor is supposed to do certain tests to see if he can identify what is causing the nerve damage. But he doesn't want to do anything and the head doctor is backing him up. What's up?",
