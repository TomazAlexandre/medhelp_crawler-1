            "answer": "I also have the tingling, burning, numbness sensation from my hip down to the soles of my feet, and my toes feel like they are not there.\u00a0\u00a0Were you tested with MRI for MS, blood tests for Lupus, and/or RA. My neurologist tested me for above, blood tests came back positive for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), I need to have more specific blood tests to rule out Lupus as well. I must have had a \"flare up\" at the beginning of all this that is why I went to the Doctors, Podiatrist, Orthopedist, and finally to the Neurologist who is now sending me to a Rheumatologist. I read that diabetes can give you the kind of pain you described, specially if it is going down to your toes. The pain is horrible, constant, although there are times when it has become bearable, I think the Neurontin RX that Neurologist gave me might be helping with the pain. Did your Dr. do all the tests that I described above?",

They thought I possible had a blockage in a arteries that was pressing on a Nerve..All and all , it just seems like a dog chasing it tail to find what is wrong with me. This pain in my thigh seems to be going further up my leg and it like a bee sting.\u00a0\u00a0I had this problem way before the Borderline Diabetes came along. I have already had a disc fusion and plate put on my c5,6,7 vertebra\u00a0\u00a0and also have 3 compression\u00a0\u00a0in my t5,6,7vertebra and also L2 and 3 bulged disc. With all this evidence it just seems as if the VA is not willing to go any further in stopping this trouble. Every response is\"Inoperable situation\" and I just should get use to the pain...",
