            "answer": "Hi,I do not think the diabetes you had during your pregnancy had anything to do with the pancreatic mass (that would be an unusual situation where much of the pancreas is no longer working because of the mass). The vision problems may or may not be related--some pancreatic masses can be related to pituitary problems and that can cause vision deficits.In either case I think this should be very aggressively evaluated and treatment plan developed in the very near future. Please be sure to press your doctor on this and ensure that all studies and referrals are done as soon as possible.Take care.",

            "answer": "I have a good friend that just had total gastrectomy surgery a little over a month ago. Since then she has been hospitalized twice, for high fever, a fluid mass on her liver, then a fluid mass on her pancreas. They say they think it is due to stomach fluid that probably leaked when they removed the stomach. Is this common? What can they do to stop this happening on her organs? Is there anything they can do to clean out the stomach fluid they think is causing this to happen? She is very distraught and desperate for answers. The hospital she is in is not treating her very well. She has had numerous instances of repeated pancreatitis before the surgery and nearly died during an ERCP a few months ago when her gastric artery was accidentally nicked and she nearly bled to death. Any info would be greatly appreciatd.PJ",
