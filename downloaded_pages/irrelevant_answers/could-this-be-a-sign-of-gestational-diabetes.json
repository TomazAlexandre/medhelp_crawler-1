            "answer": "hi! I have g/d. my symtoms when i first thought that i may have it was getting really thirsty...yes, sounds like your sugar is dropping. if you don't keep enough sugar in your body it drops and you feel all shaky and clamy and i see spots sometimes..scary! If your sugar gets to high, i get really thirsty and feel high. lol but thats how it feels, to bring it down, go for a walk and drink plenty of water. I would just manage it until you see your doctor, and definitly mention it to him, he'll probably go ahead and test you. Especially if your overweight they'll test you early that anyways.good luck and keep us updated when u find out!",

    "question": "I'm about 14 weeks pregnant, i see my dr on 2/7 but was wondering if i should schedule an appointment sooner. I can't eat anything sweet without getting sick. I feel kinda shaky, tired, and my mouth gets really dry.\u00a0\u00a0I'm ok when i eat fruit or drink apple juice but anything else I just don't feel good. At first I thought it was just part of the morning sickness thing but now I seem to notice i feel sicker when i have something sweet. I tested this theory and avoided sweets for a few days and although i still had my nausea and minor all day morning sickness i did not feel as bad as i do when i have something sweet.",
