            "answer": "Hi Chelsey & welcome.......Any abnormal increase of water consumption is a heads up that something IS going on.......The top four diseases would be Kidney Disease, Liver Disease, Diabetes & Cushings Disease......Your lab needs to see her Vet for a Full Panel Blood test.....The values will help your Vet determine what to treat.....All of the above can be controlled with the right medications.....If this has really been going on for 4 mos., I wouldn't wait any longer to have her checked.......Diseases are much easier to treat when caught early.......Good luck & let us know what your Vet says.......Treatment will help her feel much better!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Make the call, ASAP.......Karla",

            "answer": "Hi,It could be something as simple as the weather. If it is particularly hot recently she could just be getting easily dehydrated. I have a black lab too and he is 9. He casts an awful, even more so when we have good weather. Not too sure what to advise on the weight lose though.A trip to the vets wouldn't do her any harm, better to be safe than sorry and get as many healthy happy years out of her as possible.All the best!",
