            "answer": "UTI stands for Urinary Tract Infection.A urinary tract infection can be anywhere along the urinary tract.\u00a0\u00a0The urinary tract is your kidneys, the ureters (the tubes that go from the kidneys to the bladder), the bladder (the bag that holds the pee) and the urethra (the tube that allows you to pee).Not all urinary tract infections will have any other symptoms other than going a lot for a pee.\u00a0\u00a0Going a lot for a pee does not necessarily mean that there is an infection.If you start a diet, your body will release stored fluids.\u00a0\u00a0Before your period starts, you may start to urinate more due to the hormonal changes.People who have diabetes, pre diabetes or glucose intolerance, will pee more if their blood sugar levels are too high, but at the same time, they will experience more thirst and will drink more.Sometimes there is a burning sensation when you pee, sometimes with a bladder infection called Cystitis, you will feel a discomfort in the lower belly.\u00a0\u00a0You may notice your urine may be cloudy, you may see visible blood (but not always), the urine may smell very strongly.A dark coloured pee may be a sign that there is blood in the urine, but it may also depend on what you have eaten.\u00a0\u00a0If you eat beetroot, your pee will be a dark colour.Normal pee should look a light straw colour and be clear and not cloudy.\u00a0\u00a0Only a laboratory analysis would provide accurate information and then sometimes the urine sample may be contaminated and a second sample may be requested.With an infection in the kidneys, you may feel pain in the groin or on teither side at the back or front just below your rib cage.\u00a0\u00a0You would feel unwell and may have a raised temperature and chills, or you may feel confused.Sometimes the doctor may get the results much later than 2 days.\u00a0\u00a0You can telephone your doctor's surgery and ask if the results have come back. The doctors surgery do not normally inform you if there is nothing wrong, but will phone you if there is a problem (in the UK)With any urinary tract infection it is very important to drink plenty of fluids, especially water.\u00a0\u00a02 litres of water a day is usually recommended by most doctors.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor may advice you to drink more.\u00a0\u00a0If you feel thirsty you are already dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0Don't drink too much all in one go, but drink reasonably throughout the day.Make sure that when you have sex, you go for a pee straight away, even if you cannot wash immediately.\u00a0\u00a0Wipe your bottom from front to back so as to avoid passing any bacteria to the front private area.\u00a0\u00a0The urethra is a very short tube and bacteria can enter it causing problems.If you have not been contacted by the end of today, Friday, telephone the surgery on Monday to see if the results have come in.",

            "answer": "A urine culture is when they send your urine to the lab to see if it grows bacteria. If it does the doctor will normally recommend antibiotics. And yes it is true that a uti can effect each person differently. Some people get really mild utis that cause little symptoms and some people can get really bad utis which usually cause worse symptoms. I think you're having anxiety because this is new to you and it's kind of the fear of the unknown. Urine cultures usually take 2-3 days to complete.",
