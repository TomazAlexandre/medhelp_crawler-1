            "answer": "I am sure the doctor has his reasons for saying what he said. But We now know that smoking is highly addictive.You need to be treated with some understanding, care and empathy.I suggest you also see a substance abuse specialist or someone with special knowledge about the addictive nature of nicotine.I teach ethics. I teach my students to respect their clients unconditionally-especially when a client is asking you for help.I wish you good luck.",

    "question": "I recently had a doctor's appointment.\u00a0\u00a0I have several medical problems and/or diseases.\u00a0\u00a0Of concern is constant pain in my legs.\u00a0\u00a0I recently had an ultrasound of my legs which showed atherosclerotic disease.\u00a0\u00a0I have an artificial heart valve as the result of damage done by radiation therapy for cancer.\u00a0\u00a0At first the doctor was suggesting a procedure running a balloon through my arteries in order to clear the blockages, but because I have been unable to stop smoking he all of a sudden said, \"forget it\", I don't want to do anything unless you quit smoking.\u00a0\u00a0He then said \"I'm tired of screwing with you\" and \"if you don't stop smoking before your next visit (6 weeks) I'm not going to be your doctor any more.\u00a0\u00a0I was so shocked I had no response to him.\u00a0\u00a0However, after leaving I found myself extremely upset over the situation.\u00a0\u00a0I also suffer from depression and needless to say this did not help.\u00a0\u00a0My question is, is this appropriate behavior for a doctor?\u00a0\u00a0Any, would you suggest that I seek another opinion from another doctor, and if so in what field.\u00a0\u00a0From the information I have been able to gather about this disease, smoking is not necessarily the cause anyway, I do not have high cholesteral, high blood pressure, diabetes or any other of the causes, except perhaps family history, of which I'm not sure.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your thoughts on my concerns, I am anxiously awaiting your response.My email address is ***@****",
