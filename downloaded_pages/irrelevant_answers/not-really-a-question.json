            "answer": "What are your health habits? Are you starving yourself? Do have feel you're suffering from anorexia nervosa? Or is the weight loss just something that's happening?Any inappropriate weight loss or weight gain should be reported to a doctor.If it's anorexia nervosa, you need to seek help immediately. Without the proper nutrition, your body is feeding on itself.We do live in a culture that's simply asinine about obesity. On the one hand, obesity is worse than it has ever been. On the other, we're more self-conscious about our weight than we've ever been. It would seem an oxymoron, but I think the two are absolutely related.",

            "answer": "The weight loss was somewhat intentional at the beginning...stopped bad snacking, started walking, even was able to get off oxygen. But, since being put on seizure meds, having left my husband (caught him having cyber-sex), chronic insomnia, and the loss of my mother, the weight just keeps coming off. I try to eat well-balanced meals at regular intervals, with light snacks throughout the day, but I still keep losing weight. And truthfully, my PCP doesn't seemed concerned. I see her Fri. and plan on asking about Ensure or another nutritional high-calorie drink. I'm at a loss. Any ideas?",

            "answer": "It sounds like a serious medical condition or something brought on by stress. You've been through a lot, and the stress may be robbing you of any potential for a healthy body. The insomnia is a problem, too.Weight loss could potentially be a side effect of your seizure medication. If that's the case, you may need to invest in some high-calorie nutritional shakes in order to maintain your weight. Would insomnia possibly be another side effect?Otherwise, I'm surprised your physician isn't concerned.\u00a0\u00a0She should at least attempt to get to the source of the problem. If it's your medication, then she should look for an alternative. Sometimes we really have to fight for ourselves when it comes to dealing with doctors.Maybe make a list of questions to ask her when you see her tomorrow. It also may help you to see a counselor if you haven't already.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the suggestions. If she don't give me some help tomorrow, I'm going to look for another PCP. I don't see the neuro until Feb. 25, but still, the PCP should be looking into this. As far as a counselor, I was seeing one, but I closed my case because she didn't want to discuss the things I wanted to...doesn't that figure.\u00a0\u00a0Health care where I live is very poor. Thanks again for the help. And I will make a list of questions.",

            "answer": "I went to the PCP on Friday, Jan. 21. I had a seizure in her office...sent by ambulance to the hospital. I just got out today (Sunday). They spoke with my neuro) and uped my 1 med, and put me on a different antibiotic. My PCP said that Ensure or Boost were for people who had cancer or another life-threatening disease, not for unexpected weight loss. I have been pucking since. I can't keep anything down. I think the antibiotic is causing it, so I am not going to take it now that I am home. I have asked my sister who lives in Arizona to do some research about neurologists and doctors out there. I may go there if they have anyone that is better than what we have here. she has said many times that they have a huge university that deals with neurological problems, and that they are one of the best in the country. I feel that I have to do something. Thanks for all your help.",

Do you know which ones?\u00a0\u00a0Antibiotics can cause nausea, etc, but I can't help think there's something else wrong.Please get tested for hyperthyroidism and diabetes, if you haven't already been.",

Make sure you're taking your antibiotics after you've eaten and have a full stomach. I took one on an empty stomach, and it made me nauseous for hours.I hope you can find a better doctor. Just from what I've read here, I'm not too pleased with the one you have now.",

I tried to eat some toast, and it stayed down...so I hope that later I can get something more in me. Tomorrow I will get some Boost or Ensure regardless what she thinks. At this point I really don't care...don't like her anyhow. She never even came to the hospital to look after me either. I don't consider her very good.\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks to both of you... and I hope everything turns out better than this weekend has. Thanks again.",
