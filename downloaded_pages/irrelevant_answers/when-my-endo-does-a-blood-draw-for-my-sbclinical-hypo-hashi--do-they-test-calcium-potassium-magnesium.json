            "answer": "Routine thyroid retest would not include electrolytes - would need to ask specifically for these (sounds appropriate given the symptoms) and if the calcium is normal, it's not likely parathyroid.",

            "answer": "I have hashi's and was undertreated by my endo for 2 yrs and had awful muscle cramps and joint pain. I finally found a new endo who specializes in thyroid....not diabetes...and he is the one that educated me on hashi's. He told me i had been undertreated and that is why i still have so many symptoms. He said that anyone with hashi's should have a tsh level suppressed to .50-1.0 in order for your body to heal, anything higher than that you will remain sick. Don't forget that with hashi's you will have to keep a close eye on your levels as the antibodies destroy your thyoid, you will need dosage changes. I went even more hypo when i found this new endo...kind of a double edged sword....undertreated and going more hypo again! Thank heavens i found this new endo! Food for thought: T3 level should be high normal.....if lower a little cytomel may help you to feel a little better. As we get older our bodies don't convert t4 to t3 as well.",

    "question": "The reason I ask is I continue to get bad cramping even though my lab results were 3.3 and normal Free T 3 and 4. I am taking 75 mg Synthroid, but cramping in hands, feet, shoulders. forearms, Transient and nearly nonstop. Small muscles throughout my body. That, and palpitations at night.1. Do endo's generally check things like calcium, potassium and magnesium when doing the 6 month draws? I give two vials. I know you personally don't know my situation, but theoretically? Is that part of the monitoring process for Hashi's and Hypo as a rule?2. If my recent (10 day ago labs) say everything OK. TSH, Free Ts and electrolytes, could the cause be Synthroid?3. Could it be parathyroid? Anxiety?",
