            "answer": "The forum Doctor may stop by and comment in a thread.Here's my opinion; A non-fasting glucose level of 80 would make me suspicious of the doctors comments \"good and there was no need for further testing\" as it has with you. A blood test known as the hemoglobin A1C may be performed to assess your sugar control over the past 3-month period. You can read about it here:http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003640.htmI would also ask to be referred to an Endocrinologist, or seek a second opinion away from your current doctor.",

            "answer": "thanks for the response. I don't know much about sugar levels, so why do the doctors comments seem suspicious? Is it b/c non-fasting sugar levels don't tell you much, or b/c the level (80) itself isn't good?BTW, I'm going to another doctor and have him look at things just to be sure.",

            "answer": "\"I don't know much about sugar levels, so why do the doctors comments seem suspicious? \"Then why are you posting questions on this diabetic forum if you weren't suspicious of what the doctor told you? I'm assuming you still feel cruddy at times and she didn't provide the next step in treatment, so you're here asking for help.\"Is it b/c non-fasting sugar levels don't tell you much, or b/c the level (80) itself isn't good?\"First part; Yes it does. Its tells a diabetic about the foods they have consumed and how it effects their glucose levels. It is not, however, used to determine whether a patient is not a diabetic, pre-diabetic, or diabetic.Second part; a level of 80 is good when you're fasting for a period of 8-10 hours.Here are two web sites to educate yourself on diabetes and diabetes prevention before you see your next doctor. This way you'll be able to ask the appropriate questions and understand doctor's response while in the office.http://www.diabetes.org/home.jsphttp://www.defeatdiabetes.org/Good luck.",

    "question": "I am a 39 yr old female, normal cholesterol/bp, 5 6\" and 137 lbs. Active. Family history of type II on my mother's side (overweight, onset 50-60 yrs age) and my cousin got type I in her early 30s.My question: for over a year now, I have to eat something mid-day or even before dinner or I get very shakey, nauseated, spacey-feeling. At first it was mild and didn't happen every time I didn't eat for 2-3 hours, but now it happens every time and it's quite bad. I also feel so hungry/nauseated at the same time you'd think I hadn't eaten in days. It subsides after eating something, but I often wake in the middle of the night just famished. Mostly I try to ignore it and go back to sleep, but sometimes I'll get a granola bar and then I'm fine.B/c it has been happening more and more often, I said something to my doctor. I had just had a yearly exam and my blood sugar (non-fasting) was 80 and no sugar in my urine. She said that was good and there was no need for further testing. My question is: does a fasting or glucose tolerance test need to be done to diagnose diabetes (or hypoglycemia), or is this non-fasting number sufficient to suggest there is nothing wrong?thanks.",
