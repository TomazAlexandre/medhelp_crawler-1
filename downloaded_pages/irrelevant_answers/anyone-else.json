I am 34 weeks and on Wednesday they said my amniotic fluid was too high due to the sugar levels so I will need to be induced soon. Will fine out when on next Wednesday. But I never had to start medications.... it's so frustrating,\u00a0\u00a0especially when I eat what they tell me and it still does nothing!",

            "answer": "I have it, I use insulin, the problem with me right now is, is not easy for me to follow a diet because I'm getting nauseous when I eat some stuff, so is getting hard for me, and blood sugar won't go up more than 150, what concerns me is that the fasting one is between 100-110 and it wasn't like that before I enter the 3 and half months, but I'm eating as healthy as I can, I try not to eat sweet stuff and nd no pasta or rice",

            "answer": "Yes, diet worked well for me for awhile. Then when the glucose slowly increased I was started on oral meds with my last one. Very common as your progressing. This all with my last pregnancy. As soon as I had my sweet abbie my sugars were perfect if not a little low. Now that I'm expecting again my doctor is suggesting oral medication even before I'm having problems. Feeling much more on top of things this time around! Good luck!!",

            "answer": "They might have to put you on medication to help regulate your sugar levels more... I was diagnosed at week 29 and had to go on medication-- glyburide-- at around week 34... I had my baby yesterday and the hospital situation is scary.. they check your levels and baby's levels and if the baby's levels get too low they have to take them to the nicu and give them an iv for insulin... the threat of them taking my daughter to the NICU terrified me... I wanted to eexclusively breastfeed but she wasn't latching well, kept falling asleep and wasnt eating so I ended up giving her a couple bottles of formula so her sugars didn't get too low",

I didnt have any extra fluid or too low of fluid... my sugars were pretty well maintained with diet uo until I got sick 4 times in a row... my fasting levels went roo high so that's why they put me on the meds... when I was 35 weeks I had to go in twice a week for a BPP (biophysical profile) and stress test... the BPP is an ultrasound-- twice a week. ..\u00a0\u00a0now that she is out, and healthy and happy, I don't have to worry too much about diet...

Thank goodness so far everything has been diet and exercise control. No meds/no insulin. I've gained 5lbs. I try to walk after each meal around the block once or twice. It's not very physical,\u00a0\u00a0but I feel at least I'm active and just not sitting.\u00a0\u00a0I also try to eat as much free carbs as I can. Lots of salads,\u00a0\u00a0lots of protein.\u00a0\u00a0I do have days my numbers are high (over the recommend 2 hr fasting of 120) buy I've learned not to beat myself up and try again tomorrow. The constant pricking,\u00a0\u00a0and stressing over numbers on the meter has consumed my whole life/pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0There may not be anything you can do, no matter how well you eat so try not to stress so much. It's just one of those things in pregnancy that may not be in our control no matter how hard we try.",
