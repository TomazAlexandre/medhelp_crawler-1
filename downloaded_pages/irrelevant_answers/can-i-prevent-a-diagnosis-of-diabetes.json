            "answer": "Look into the diet called \"the carbohydrate addicts diet\"\u00a0\u00a0I am not a salesperson, and this diet has been out for a long time.\u00a0\u00a0It has enabled me to lose 40\u00a0\u00a0lbs and reverse prediabetes.\u00a0\u00a0What is so great about it is that you can still have the occasional \"forbidden foods\" and still keep your blood glucose level low.\u00a0\u00a0It is based on the way our bodies release insulin.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you consume all your carbs in one hour your body only releases two loads of insulin.\u00a0\u00a0I have found that during my \"one hour dinner\" I can eat ANYTHING I want including mounds of dessert. (seriously, you wouldn't believe it if you saw how I look and know what I eat)\u00a0\u00a0I finish it all in one hour and do some power walking after, which reduces my glucose level even more.\u00a0\u00a0I do also do vigorous exercise\u00a0\u00a0everyday, which I am sure helps things, and is REALLY important to control and prevent diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry to ramble.\u00a0\u00a0There really is a science to this.\u00a0\u00a0I love this diet because I am a dessert hog and I can still have my cake.\u00a0\u00a0I bought my book on half.com for about 2 dollars.\u00a0\u00a0Look it up!\u00a0\u00a0Hugs..

    "question": "I have Fibromyalgia, and have recently started to treat this through diet as advised by a private nutricianist I am seeing.\u00a0\u00a0This has had a very beneficial effect on my health.\u00a0\u00a0The diet involves removing all sugar, alcohol, simple carbs from my diet and eating something sensible every 2-3 hours to regulate blood sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0When I keep to this diet I feel well and the symptoms of Fibromyalgia diminish and my blood sugar levels out normal.If I stray off this diet my blood sugar goes up and then my GP starts sending me for blood tests, and repeat blood tests and then glucose tolerance tests.\u00a0\u00a0The last time that happened I stuck to the diet and then went for the glucose tolerance test, which came back normal.I have recently been under alot of stress and admit to having been comfort eating and drinking!\u00a0\u00a0This has sent my blood tests high again and I have been asked again to go for a glucose tolerance test.My question is, if I stick to this diet and lose some weight (i need to lose about 20 pounds).\u00a0\u00a0Could I prevent ever being diagnosed as diabetic?\u00a0\u00a0I believe that if I lose some weight that will be very beneficial.\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible if I lost the weight that I might be able to occasionally eat/drink something that is forbidden now?I did have gestational diabetes with both my children and controlled that through diet.Or is it inevitable that I will get diabetes regardless of what I do?",
