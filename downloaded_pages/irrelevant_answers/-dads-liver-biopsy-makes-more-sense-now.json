            "answer": "Hi. If your dad's liver nodule is just 3 mm in size and has not grown over time, it might not even need immediate biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0It probably just needs to be observed over 3-4 months.\u00a0\u00a0A repeat CT of the liver can be done after that time to see if that liver nodule has increased in size.\u00a0\u00a0My guess is, that's probably not cancer.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your response - You were very kind to me when I assumed the lesion was 3cm instead of 3mm, and you are very kind to respond to this post as well.They did do the biopsy today and we are waiting for the results.\u00a0\u00a0My dad's doctors seem to be very cautious with my dad because of his previous health conditions (brain anyeurysm, quintuple bypass, encephilitis, diabetes, etc...), so we are hoping that is the reason they are moving cautiously with this new odd development.He is very strong (you wouldn't even know he had any health problems unless you saw the scars on his head and chest...) and has overcome insane odds to beat previous non-cancer issues (like the anyeruysm that burst in 4 places 22 years ago and the quintuple-bypass where 2 of the grafts failed 9 years ago and the walking-diabetic coma 11 years ago and the viral encephilitis (sp?)...).\u00a0\u00a0All of these illnesses were given very poor outcomes based on the statistics, and he is fine - strong as can be...I think they mentioned if they could not get a good grasp on a sample today from the biopsy, they would wait to 'see if it grows' for another biopsy - Probably, like you mentioned in a few months.Thank you again - this forum has been wonderful to me.\u00a0\u00a0I will post with new developments.\u00a0\u00a0We are thinking now too that it might not be cancer - we are praying.",

    "question": "I am sorry to start a new post, since I already have a post about this.\u00a0\u00a0I just wanted to get this out there quickly because we are all so terrified.\u00a0\u00a0Bless you all who read this and can help.My dad's doctor found a 3mm, not 3cm 'growth' on my dad's liver on a CT.\u00a0\u00a0So, they biopsied today.\u00a0\u00a0We will get the results on Wednesday.I was wondering why they would biopsy a growth that was 3 cm in a 65-year-old man with no history of cancer (none in his family) and no cirrhosis, no drinking, no elevated liver/blood levels, no jaundice, no fatigue, no loss of appetite.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to me that a 3cm growth would be pretty cut-and-dry (either cancer or not cancer on a CT).Dad can't have an MRI because of metal clamps in his head...So, here is what is happening: They did biopsy today (needle) with CT scan.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors said they are not sure they even found this 'growth' today at the biopsy...So, am I right, the reason they biopsied is because such a small lesion is truly indeterminate in the absence of any factors indicating liver cancer???\u00a0\u00a0Are they just being extra safe???AND, they told my parents that maybe we should just wait to see 'if it grows' later to get a better biopsy.So, does this scenario sound more promising than the 3cm mass we wrongly assumed he had?\u00a0\u00a0Please anyone give me direction - so lost.Could it be an adenoma, cyst, granuloma, FNH??? We have lots of cysts in our family and benign tumors...My parents said the doctors were 'upbeat' and not too concerned today (although they are still not admitting any suspicions one way or the other...)Do we have hope?\u00a0\u00a0Wouldn't even a 3mm cancer be easier to beat???\u00a0\u00a0It has not grown in a month, it looks like...Thank you so much for input - I am hanging onto every ray of hope.",
