            "answer": "Hello!\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin is injected subcutaneously because it needs to get into the bloodstream to be effective.\u00a0\u00a0Injecting into muscle tissue would actually reduce the effectiveness of the insulin.Likely what you're seeing is the delay between the time you inject insulin and the time it starts working, typically about 15-20 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0The graph of the effectiveness starts low, rises fairly quickly after that 15-20 minutes to that 2 hour peak, then then gradually tails off.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to check on the 6 hour duration, many insulin experts will recommend you use 4 hours as the length of the insulin duration.\u00a0\u00a0So your blood sugar rises because of the immediate release into your system of the carbs in the ice cream, flooding your bloodstream with carbs, and the insulin takes a bit to get working.Two possible options for you are to inject your insulin a little earlier, so it's in your system and working when you eat the ice cream, or to try to find ice cream with lower carbs.\u00a0\u00a0There are plenty of delicious options available.\u00a0\u00a0Either one of those will work better than injecting into muscle tissue.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

            "answer": "I would have to say that your theory that blood doesn't reach muscles is false. After a while of googleing I found this article.http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1663362&blobtype=pdfIt says that in fact intramuscular injects are faster, although this varies with insulin type. I can",

    "question": "I currently take humalog before meals and such.. The peak time is around 2 hours with a duration of like 6. So anyway I was wondering, When I go out with my friends and eat ice cream or something like, right now the sugar peaks way before my humalog, but what if I injected my humalog into muscle tissue, so it was absorbed rapidly. I think this would better match the peak of the sugar. Lets say im eating on an empty stomach so it is absorbed very fast. Has anyone tried this or done something like this before?",
