    "question": "I have posted a question, but after reading other peoples questions and the replies I wonder if it is MS Is it possible to have alot of symptoms within about 3 weeks? I know it can take months or even years to diagnose MS. I go to see the neuro-ophthamologist Tuesday, but I am afraid he is going to think I\u00a0\u00a0am just crazy, or tell me its all in my head. I really need some answers soon! If possible. I am so worried I hope they find what is wrong. Since the other ophthamologist said it was my blood sugar and that my sudden vision change was related to my sugar going up and down, and it would make my vision fluctuate but my blurriness is there all the time. I know i have already said some of this, but I am scared about what i might find out. Maybe it is all in my head, but I know my vision isn't all in my head. I can't see things that are close up now and it just happened suddenly.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GoRollTide",
