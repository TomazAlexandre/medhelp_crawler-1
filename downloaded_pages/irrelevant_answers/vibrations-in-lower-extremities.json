            "answer": "Sensory symptoms in the feet have a broad range of causes, the most common of which seem to have been tested by your doctor. There are a variey of other less common causes which can be tested based on your full history and neurological examiantion (unfortunately I dont have the full benefit of this here)They might include blood tests for sjogrens syndrome, monoclonal proteins or neuropathy antibodies, B12 deficeincy, HIV, paraneoplastic antibodies, heavy metals, sarcoid, and amyloid. Again these conditions are rare and testing needs to be tailered to your specific case. Pre-diabetes is an increasingly recognised cause and is tested for by a glucose tolerance test rather than just a blood glucose. Nerve conduction studies are unlikely to be very helpful, other tests such as a skin biopsy for epidermal nerve fiber density are available at larger centers if the above are negative.Good luck",

            "answer": "Hello.I know of two problems that could be causing this.\u00a0\u00a0Spinal stenosis (some people get this sensation when they're lying in bed, or straighten up) and neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0You said you already had an MRI of your spine -- did it show any evidence of tightening of the spinal canal?\u00a0\u00a0How old are you?Neuropathy can come in different forms.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetic neuropathy is the most common cause of sensory neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes it can precede the formal diagnosis of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0To further evaluate this, your neurologist should perform himself, or send you to a specialist who can perform an EMG / NCV (electromyography / nerve conduction study) to confirm a presence of neuropathy, or further localize this problem.Good luck.ON",

            "answer": "It is quite common to have findings on EMG but nothing on an MRI.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MRI is, in fact, not as sensitive as EMGs.\u00a0\u00a0 However, anyone could have findings of a radiculopathy of one form or another.\u00a0\u00a0 However, your symptoms do not have any correlation with an L2 radiculopathy, therefore, this finding is most likely unrelated.Did they do a sensory study on your NCVs?\u00a0\u00a0You may have a small fiber neuropathy, which is also difficult to pick up on regular NCVs.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure they test you for all vitamin deficiencies.\u00a0\u00a0Do you drink alcohol?\u00a0\u00a0Are you exposed to any toxins?\u00a0\u00a0 Do you have any family history of diabetes or neuropathies?If none of these help, ask your doctor for a trial of \"Lyrica\".\u00a0\u00a0It has been approved for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, but it's been used in other types of neuropathies as well.Good luck.",

My MRI of the brain and blood tests came back normal. I am getting an EMG next Tuesday. I have no other symptoms but these but they are enough to scare me to death. I have been going through an awful and traumatic divorce for 2 years now. I have a history of anxiety and depression. BUT these symptoms are very real. Any assistance or insight would let me sleep at night. THANK YOU and my heartfelt wishes of wellness to each of you! :)",

            "answer": "I am a 30yr old male that recently has come down with these issues. I have constant twitching, pain, burning,and cold and hot spots in my legs all the time. Mostly I get this when sitting in an upright position at work. ( I work as an IT Admin ) I also have diareah with these symptoms as well every morning, along with nauseua. I have been to a Gastrotologist and had my pancreas checked, thinking I had poss. pancreatic cancer, which has been ruled out.I am not sure how this all started, but I can try to explain. I played football one day with my brother-in-law, in which the next day I could hardly move due to being so sore. It took a couple days, but I felt pretty good after a while. Then one day, I got sick.......I mean flu-like symptoms, but what was weird was that my legs were hurting soooo bad I could hardly stand it. I thought it just was some weird flu that would just go away......well, I was wrong. The flu symptoms went away, but the leg pain stayed. Sometimes worse, somtimes not so bad. I still have it, and now I am getting some pain in the middle of my back. I really am scared that I have something horrible. I have had all kinds of blood work done. Including lyme, thyroid, diabetis, etc. and everything is came back fine. I just don't know where to turn.People think I'm just nuts because they can't find aything wrong with me. I even resulted to giving in to them and went and asked my dr. for some Anxiety Meds. But, I am afraid to take them. I know it's got to be nerve related, but I don't know where to turn.Note: I also get indigestion alot, if that helps.",

Nausea, burning,hot and cold spots in my legs, diarrhea, and indigestion.I have been to gastro-enterologists (twice). I too thought i had pancreatic cancer, which i think is pretty unlikely.I've also seen a neurologist twice too. HIV, b12 deficiency,and diabetes have all been ruled out to date.The strangist thing is that like you, these symptoms are almost entirely only really experienced when i am sat down, and i work in IT too.My current theory is somekind of entrapment neuropathy, but i do not know if it is worth going to another neurologuist for what is a uncomfortable, but never painful condition.Like you, all of this seems to have come on after some kind of flu-type illness.",

    "question": "about 3 months now my legs and feet have had a tingling vibrating feeling.sometimes feel pins and needles in feet. it doesnt really hurt but very annoying.it came on suddenly. my neurologist had me do an mri of lumbar,mri of brain, and blood work{lyme,sugar,thyroid,etc.). she said everything was normal. she doesnt know what could be causing this and said it may go away overtime. im glad the mri's are ok,but im still worried about what this could be,its very annoying and im afraid it will get worse. i should mention that around the same time my shoulder has been hurting me.i asked if i pinched a nerve in my shoulder would this be the cause. the doctor said i would feel it in my arms not my legs. does anyone know what this could be. thank you for your site and help.",
