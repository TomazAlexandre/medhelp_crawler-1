            "answer": "Yes, the metformin supresses TSH if individual has TPO antibodies in the blood; at the same time it stops some nodules from growing (by supressing TSH)",

            "answer": "I did a search for drug interactions and found that hypoglygemic agents (metformin) and insulin may be diminished by certain drugs; there's a whole list of them, but thyroid hormones, is one on the list, that's why your instructions said you might have to alter your diabetes med.898_1 -- that's interesting about metformin suppressing TSH if one has TPO antibodies.\u00a0\u00a0I have a friend who had TT and is on both metformin and levo; his TSH bottomed out and his doctor thought he was hyper (based on TSH only), so started backing off on his thyroid med -- didn't take long at all to send him off to hypo he//........",

            "answer": "There are a few diabetes meds on the market here in Australia and usually if your levels are affected by Metformin.Usually when the levels arent controlled by Metformin (Diabex) then Lipitor is given (to avoid vascular problems) and also Dianycron.You may have to 'google' these meds as they are the brand names.But the best meds for diabetes II and intracontradictions with Levo are a maintenance dose of Metformin (which helps weight loss too) and Diamycron.My partner takes Metform morning and night and 1 x lipitor in the morning with 1 x diamycron in the evening.The Diamycron is the one thats a fraction stronger than the Metformin.Maybe talk to your Doc about these meds.Hope that helps.",

            "answer": "TXGrama:\u00a0\u00a0You were very helpful I did not know that Metformin suppressed TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe that is why my TSH was not much over the threshold.89_1:\u00a0\u00a0I do have TPO antibody's.\u00a0\u00a0Good to know that the Metformin will help to prevent nodules.Barb135:\u00a0\u00a0I am not taking the Metformin with the Levothyroxine.\u00a0\u00a0I take the levo immediately upon waking.\u00a0\u00a0I take the Metformin about an hour and a half later after breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0The other I take at bedtime.\u00a0\u00a0To be honest exercise was not something I have been able to get back to yet.\u00a0\u00a0I am just now picking myself up from rock bottom.\u00a0\u00a0I am slowly getting my energy back.\u00a0\u00a0My numbers were running from 70-120 before the thryoid medicine.\u00a0\u00a0Now they are at 175-240.\u00a0\u00a0I am eating the same things as before the medicine.Smilerdeb:\u00a0\u00a0Australia.\u00a0\u00a0What a beautiful place.\u00a0\u00a0That is the only foreign country I have ever wanted to visit. I have always thought I needed something additional to add to the Metformin because I have never been able to get the results that I think I should have.\u00a0\u00a0The Dr. had me on Actos for a while and I was kind of afraid of that and it did not help my numbers anyway.\u00a0\u00a0The levothyroxine has already helped me after just one week.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I am back from the land of the dead.\u00a0\u00a0I hope it remains that way.\u00a0\u00a0I missed my call back from my Endo today so I will have to talk to her tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0My goal has always been to lose weight and not need the Diabetes medication.\u00a0\u00a0I would diet and exercise and the scale would not budge.\u00a0\u00a0That only frustrated me and eventually I would give up.\u00a0\u00a0Once my energy level is back I hope to really start exercising again.Thanks to everyone who answered and looked up information for me.\u00a0\u00a0You guys are fantastic here on this forum.",

            "answer": "The secret if you can to normalising the blood sugars is small meals (snacks) making sure you have breakfast.Porridge Oats would have to be the best breakfast a Diabtic can have as its not fattening, has protein and helps lower the sugar levels when first rising. It also sees you through to mid morning.As you wouldve been told...DO NOT take any form of Grapefruit while on diabetes meds as this is dangerous and a no-no.Eat fresh fruit....(fruit salad to snack on) if you can make one up it will last 2 days in the fridge.Avoid all bottled juices as they contain the highest amount of sugar and avoid all prepackaged foods.Fresh is best with diabetes.Steamed vegetables, steamed fish, etc is great for diabetics.It is ok to have a 'binge' every now and then but follow it with a glass of water as that also lowers the levels.Drink as much water as you can.If you feel the need for chocolate....a few peices of dark chocolate (Jamaican Gold) is the best one to have...this has also been proved.Sourdough bread, rye bread, wholemeal or Pita bread (lebanese bread) is the best.The secret is small snacks frequently.Canned Tuna(in springwater) can be eaten as often as you want.Always keep tins in the cupboard for when you get hungry.Hope that helps.....My Mum is a Diabetic (and I have worked in Aged Care with Diabetics) and my partnner found out he was a diabetic type II the same day I found out I had Graves Disease.Eating the foods mentioned above....he lost 9 kgs in 9 weeks which brought his levels down really well.His last 3 monthly bloods showed his cholesterol good and sugar levels good too.It took a while to get used to the change of diet for him as he was always a McDonalds eater lol......but you get used to it.I changed my diet too to everything as fresh as possible and no prepacked foods.",

    "question": "I am a Type II Diabetic. I currently take 1000mg twice daily of Metformin. Worked pretty well for me. Last week started on levothyroxine and now my blood sugar is through the roof. Anyone else have the same problems? It says I might have to alter my diabetes meds. If anyone is out there with the same thing can you recommend a medication that worked for you?",
