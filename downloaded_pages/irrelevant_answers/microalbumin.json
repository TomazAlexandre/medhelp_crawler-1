            "answer": "\"I am searching for a new doctor for her\"You're on the right path and a great son. Any doctor who treats by prescribing medication to right another medication that caused adverse side affects should be ditched, fired. Run don't walk away from this doctor and go find another doctor. It may take several doctors until you find the right one who can converse to you what his plan is but continue until you do find a good one.FYI...\"Oral hypoglycemic drugs, including glimepiride, have been associated with increased cardiovascular mortality.\"Good luck. Keep in mind diabetes can be controlled before it controls the patient through moderate exercise and a good balanced diet low in carbs, no sugar, lots of fruits, vegetables and grains. Eat well, live healthy, stay alive.",

            "answer": "waveRider is right, find a new Dr. soon. I just shake my head, Doctor's that don't give u answers or there time, they need to pass a straight A bedside manner test before recieving their MD licence. But your dear Mother is very lucky to have u to care and be concerned for her. A good dr. will explain the test results and change her med's to help her not harm her. But a Low carb diet is the right diet for Diabetes, and exercise, walking just 15 min twice a day will help her Diabetes. Sometimes this disease brings on high LDL's or TRIG's and high blood pressure. If she is on BP med's like u said u need to keep and eye on her blood pressure. If her blood pressure is low it can make her feel tired. And Lisinopril can cause fatigue also. And low blood sugar or even to high blood sugar can cause tiredness. Get her to a new Dr. and even try to find one that care for the elderly, and I hope she starts feeling better, my guess is she will...YOUR A GOOD SON, Debbie",
