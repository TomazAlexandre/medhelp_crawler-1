            "answer": "Have you been checked for diabetes? In a lot of cases, people with diabetes become very week after meals. As far as the heart rate, it could possibly be just anxiety. I know I had anxiety when I was having problems with breathing which caused my blood pressure to skyrocket. I would get some blood work done and illiminate the possibility of diabetes as weakness after a meal is quite common\u00a0\u00a0among diabetics.",

            "answer": "Hi,I would look into food intolerances.\u00a0\u00a0I recently realized I am lactose intolerant, (and possibly some other foods too,) but I have very similar episodes.\u00a0\u00a0Just a week ago, I felt very weak, nauseas, and wanted to just lie down after eating 2 fiber bars for breakfast (I've had some problems with them since this and have eliminated them from my diet) then I had a salad for lunch ( I also seem to have alot of problems with salads, even w/out the cheese.) As for the heartrate, I get that alot too, but as it sounds like you've done, I 've had all kinds of tests. They did say I have PAC's (premature atrial contractions) (basically, an extra heartbeat), and it's benign, but the doctor also explained that the Vagus nerve supplies your heart, digestion and breathing, so when one thing stimulates it (like indigestion), it can stimulate your heart too.\u00a0\u00a0That made me feel better about the heart rate anyway. As for indigestion, see, I said that was my problem for a long time too.\u00a0\u00a0What I am learning about lactose intolerance,( and other food intolerances as well,I guess) is that the food doesn't get digested so bacteria that are in your body begin to attack it and give off gases that cause pain and bloating. NowI'm wondering if the gas makes the intestines spasm and causes\u00a0\u00a0pain that, for me mimics cramps. It radiates to my back and legs and lends to the weak feeling.I certainly don't have all the answers, but what I have figured out, I've gotten from reading others' experiences more so than from the doctors in some cases, so I hope you find help at this site.\u00a0\u00a0The advice from the last post on diabetes is a good one, too, but I thought the same thing and was checked. It was normal as well.\u00a0\u00a0Keep posting and maybe we'll both get to the bottom of this.\u00a0\u00a0I left work today because I felt so bad I just couldn't work, and thought I'd check to see if anyone else had this problem!",

            "answer": "Hello, I am so glad to speak to someone else, who has this, my doctors have treated me as a time waster for years!\u00a0\u00a0 The palpitations nd chest tightness after a meal (if I try to walk etc.) are the most problem, as this also then makes the heart rate shoot up. Then I feel dreadful.\u00a0\u00a0Docs put me on drugs, although there was no sign of heart problem.I think they just don't rate it as an official illness.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bye the way, I drank a very small glass of green ginger wine after a friend told me it may help, but as with all alchohol, even a tiny amount, I go to sleep after 7 mins or so.I am sorry to go on - it's very boring.\u00a0\u00a0 But would greatly appreciate your comments and any info. you may have.\u00a0\u00a0 Please keep in touch.\u00a0\u00a0 I am in England.\u00a0\u00a0 Bye.",
