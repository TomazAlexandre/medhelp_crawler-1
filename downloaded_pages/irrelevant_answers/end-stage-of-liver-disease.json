            "answer": "So sorry you're going through this. Is there any reason your brother isn't being considered for transplant? That would be the question I would be asking. Also - in addition to scrubbing toxins, the liver makes fuels for the body out of what we eat. We can help it ALOT by eating the right things. Think gogs of (preferably organinc) veggies. Don't think sugar, starch, or fatty meat - or much red meat at all....Good luck to you?",

    "question": "My brother is in his 3rd year of chemo for Hep C.\u00a0\u00a0He also suffers from schizophrenia, diabetes, and esophageal varices.\u00a0\u00a0The outlook doesn't look good and his hepatologist has told me he is in end stage liver disease.My brother lives 1500 miles away with my 85 year old mother taking care of him...he does not want to move from the home he grew up in.\u00a0\u00a0All of this is devastating to my mother. The plane trips, etc\u00a0\u00a0to me for emergencies of my mother and brother are getting more frequent.What exactly is end stage liver disease?\u00a0\u00a0Is it something you can live with for years?\u00a0\u00a0I do not want to move my brother if he doesn't have that much longer to live...a year or so...but, I can't keep flying up and my mother can barely remember what day it is.\u00a0\u00a0I will go and stay with them if his life expectancy is not long, but if it's more than about a year, I want to move them here.\u00a0\u00a0His doctor has been vague in this area...end stage is all I get (and yes, she has written permission to discuss his health with me).Please help me with understanding what end stage liver entails.",
