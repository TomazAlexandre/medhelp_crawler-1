            "answer": "To follow up some, I got one of those blood sugar monitors (they're nice and cheap here), and the numbers still look good to me: 78 fasting, 93 one hour after a (relatively carb-heavy) meal. Still think it's worthwhile to bother the doctor about A1C?The thyroid test results were: T3: 119.6 (range 80-200); T4: 7.0 (range 5.1-14.1); TSH: 1.8 (range .3-4.2). I don't know how to interpret that, but to my untrained eye, that doesn't look like the bottom or top of the range.I guess I should go for urinalysis as well, but I don't have a lot of what I'm told are the obvious UTI symptoms: pain when urinating, and urgency. What I'm getting more like high frequency, with a LOT of urine being produced relative to how much I drink. So to answer your question, meniere, it's excessive amounts, and not frequent trips with smaller amounts.I don't think it's the climate, either. It's relatively hot and dry here, but I've been to this climate before for extended periods, and nothing like this has ever happened.Anyway, thanks for all the advice and support on this. The constant urinating is disruptive, the exhaustion is really, really getting in the way of my life, and I'm sort of at wit's end here as to what, if anything, I can do about it. Once again, any and all insight/advice is appreciated.",

            "answer": "Apologize ahead for jumping in on this thread with my 2 cents. From what I have read your glucose levels appear to be within normal ranges, including your Thyroid. Have you had a CBC (Complete Blood Count) with Differential? The CBC includes the following tests;\u00a0\u00a0Hemoglobin, Hematocrit,\u00a0\u00a0Red blood cell (RBC) count,\u00a0\u00a0White blood cell (WBC) count, White blood cell differential count, Platelet count. Usually a CBC is ordered when a patient complains of fatigue or weakness, or has an unknown infection such as UTI (Urinary Tract Infection). Living in 3rd world country the latter is a possibility.",

    "question": "I'm 28 years old, male, not overweight, exercise religiously, blood pressure normal, cholesterol levels good, etc. Over the last few months, I've been having some of the classic warning signs of diabetes - very frequent urination, somewhat increased thirst, extreme fatigue that no amount of sleep or exercise seems to relieve - but the blood glucose tests are coming back normal. Any idea what might be going on here? As an added twist, I'm currently in a 3rd world country where the standard of medical care is fairly low, so any advice is appreciated.",
