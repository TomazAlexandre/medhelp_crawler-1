            "answer": "Here is some information you will find useful.\u00a0\u00a0Since you dont have any other symptoms and your doctor gave ou the all-clear when this happened to you last September, I think it is HIGHLY likely that paragraph 2 applies to you.\"The need to urinate more often than usual may or may not be accompanied by an increase in the amount released. Common causes of frequent urination without an increase in the amount include urinary tract infection; STDs such as herpes, chlamydia, and gonorrhea; pregnancy; changes in the vagina due to menopause; and in women who've had more than one pregnancy, inability to completely empty the bladder and poor bladder support.Stress can also make one feel the need to urinate more often, as can drinking beverages containing caffeine. Some people simply have small bladders that fill up more quickly.Strokes or problems with the nerves that control the urinary system can affect the need to urinate. In adolescents, frequent urination can be a first sign of an overactive thyroid gland.If the need for frequent urination is accompanied by an increase in the amount, possible causes include drinking more water than usual, diabetes, alcohol, diuretics (\u201cwater pills\u201d) for high blood pressure and other heart conditions, kidney disease, and high levels of calcium in the blood.As you can see, frequent urination is not necessarily a cause for alarm, but if you see no simple explanation for it, a medical check-up may be in order. No matter how harmless a symptom may turn out to be, you can't be certain of your health without a visit to the doctor. If you suspect you have any of the conditions mentioned here, you'll find more information in the chapters that follow. Since no amount of knowledge can replace the certainty and relief that comes with a definite diagnosis, if you feel the slightest cause for concern, do call your doctor.\"",

            "answer": "As a side note, this will sound a little counter-intuitive but you should start drinking a lot more than what you are!\u00a0\u00a06-8 glasses of water a day is a recommended amount - if you are only drinking 1.5 cups of beverage\u00a0\u00a0a day (and one part of that is a diuretic) you run the risk of getting dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0Water is necessary to sustain life, and if you arent drinking enough that will certainly impact your physical/emotional state.\u00a0\u00a0This will likely not help with your frequent urination (UNLESS you have the beginnings of a UTI) but you will be better off for it.",
