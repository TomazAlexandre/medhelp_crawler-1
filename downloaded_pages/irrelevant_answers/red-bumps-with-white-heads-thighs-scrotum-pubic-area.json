            "answer": "Hi,In most individuals there are outbreaks of folliculitis from time to time.Folliculitis is infection and inflammation of the hair follicles. The condition may be superficial (i.e., on the surface of the skin) or deep within the follicles.The most common cause of folliculitis is infection by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus.Folliculitis symptoms can appear independent of infection. Exposure of the skin to certain chemicals, especially oils and tars, can trigger an outbreak. People with depressed immune systems, diabetes, or obesity have a greater risk of contracting folliculitis than the general population.Patients with chronic unresponsive folliculitis may require investigation into the source of the infection. S. aureus bacteria can live in the patient's nostrils, periodically triggering a folliculitis outbreak.Individuals who are predisposed to folliculitis should be extremely careful about personal hygiene. Application of antiseptic washes may help prevent recurrences. A topical antibiotic cream, mupirocin (Bactroban\u00ae), has been effective at reducing bacterial colonization in the nostrils. It is applied twice daily for a week and is repeated every 6 months.If there any of the mentioned medical causes then treating those will reduce the occurence of the condition.http://www.dermatologychannel.net/follicle/folliculitis.shtmlSome stubborn cases of folliculitis have been responsive to laser-assisted hair removal. This process uses a laser to destroy the follicle. This reduces the scarring that results from folliculitis.Let us know if you need any other information and consult a skin specialist if the lesion is persistent.Regards.",

    "question": "I have small red bumps on my left thigh, pubic region and one slightly larger one on the side of my scrotum.\u00a0\u00a0They all have whiteheads and kind of look like pimples, except one near my belly button is much larger and has a reddish area around it.\u00a0\u00a0It popped on its own and a white pus like substance came out.\u00a0\u00a0I'm afraid to touch the one on my scrotum and the ones on my thigh won't pop.I have unprotected sex with my girlfriend, who found out she had HPV after a pelvic exam about 6 months ago after we had sex. Obviously this is what I thought it was first, but everything I've read about HPV describes the genital warts differently.\u00a0\u00a0I recently shaved my pubic area/scrotum but I have done that for years, although not as frequently in the past year (and I don't shave my thighs).I'm not sure if this is an STD, folliculitis, cysts or something else? Please Help.",
