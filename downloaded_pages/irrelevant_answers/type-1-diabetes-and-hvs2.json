I understand that there may be a dearth in literature on this subject - Type 1 Diabetes and its possible overlap with HSV2 - but I would like an educated answer. Please give me some idea what the risks may pose? Is it innocuous or threatening?",

It's just that this is probably a difficult question to answer, as it's a very specific scenario.I hope you can find what you're looking for. My best advice is to speak with a Dr, an endocrinologist or someone who specializes in STD's perhaps.",

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with HSV2 and want to know what risks contracting it might pose for Type 1 Diabetic partner? The partner has had Type 1 for over 30 years, and manages it quite well, but has had some serious vision scares. Want to be in a relationship - taking all precautions - but he is dubious. Need some insight for some hope.In the Herpes Forum I was told and advised: \"His diabetes isn't an issue.\u00a0\u00a0If you are on daily suppressive therapy and use condoms consistently he's very unlikely to contract hsv2 from you anyways.\u00a0\u00a0Has he been tested yet to know his own status?\"Thank you for your help.Helia",
