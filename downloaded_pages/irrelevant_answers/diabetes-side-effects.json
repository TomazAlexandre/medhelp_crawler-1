            "answer": "Metformin, like other medications, can cause a fair number of gastric issues. If you're not watching the fat in your diet, this med in addition to fat in the diet (after having your GB removed) can cause problems such as those you're mentioning. If you are consuming fats, try cutting back and see if that's of help.",

    "question": "Recently i was diagnosed with Diabetes2, and prescribed Metformin, 500mg twice a day.\u00a0\u00a0I started taking it about a month ago, and was doing ok, till a week ago,,,I had a little discomfort at first, but now it is worse, with stomach discomfort, loose stools, and bloat,,,,the loose stools have been ongoing for about a week, so my doctor cut my dose in half,,,they still didn't stop, and today I had a yellow appearing stool, very loose,,,I am wondering if Metformin is causing this,,,I also took a glass of water with apple cider vinegar last night, cause I heard that helped lower blood sugar,,,I have also had my gall bladder removed,,,any correlations here at all? I saw my doctor today, but he didn't seem too worried, and told me to take another med,,called onglyza starting tomorrow,,,I am really worried, and having a real bad time with this,,,,I don't know what to do,,feel the need to see another doctor, but don't have insurance right now and he sees me at a real reduced rate,,,what can or should I doThis discussion is related to/posts/show/231558.",
