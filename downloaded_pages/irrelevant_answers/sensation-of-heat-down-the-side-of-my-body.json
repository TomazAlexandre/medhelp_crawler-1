            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, you are having some neurological problem involving one half of your body. There is a chance that there is compression of the spinal nerves in the cervical spine region. This can cause numbness and loss of function in one half of body if compression is high up or just a sensation of heat or an abnormal sensation. `The other possibility of similar symptoms in one half of body is TIA or transient ischemic attack. To diagnose a TIA or mini stroke you need to have a MRI close to the episode. If TIA is suspected then all predisposing factors to TIA should be ruled out like polycythemia vera, sickle cell disease, diabetes, hyperviscosity syndromes, hypertension etc.This can be a medical emergency, so rush to ER when you have the symptom. Take care!",

    "question": "I have a strange, extremely warm sensation that suddenly runs down the outer side of my left leg, sometimes, it occurs simultaneously down my outer left arm to the elbow and also sometimes this will include down the left side of my torso. It is not painful but very noticeably warm to the point that sometimes I jump. This has started suddenly. Should I be concerned?Thank you so much for your time,Cindy",
