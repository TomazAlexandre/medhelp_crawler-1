            "answer": "\"I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes last year and have been on metformin for about 2 years.This has controlled the blood sugar levels but all the symptoms are still present.\"Medication alone will not control and manage your glucose levels. What are they - fasting, preprandial and postprandial? How often do you test? Are you eating a diabetic diet, exercising daily and at normal body weight? Without this information we cannot tell whether diabetes is playing any role with your health issues.You may get additional responses by posting on the Ask A Doctor forums Gastroenterology / Digestive Disorders and Neurology [leg pain].",
