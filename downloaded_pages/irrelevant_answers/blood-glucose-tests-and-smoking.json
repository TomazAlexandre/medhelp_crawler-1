    "question": "I'm having some blood work done that will include a glucose test. The requisition form includes instructions to fast for 12 hours prior to the test, but does not mention anything about tobacco use, and I do unfortunately smoke.Perhaps to be safe I should abstain from smoking as well as food prior to the test, as nicotine could affect my blood glucose levels. But on the other hand, doesn't *nicotine withdrawal* also affect blood glucose levels? I've heard it claimed that some nicotine withdrawal symptoms are really mild hypoglycemia, although I am unsure about the accuracy of that claim.Any suggests on how to proceed? What about smoking a couple of hours before the test, so that I would have neither significant nicotine in my system nor be in significant withdrawal? Note that I have no current diagnosis of diabetes, but that possibility is one reason my glucose is being tested.",
