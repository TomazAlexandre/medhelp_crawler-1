            "answer": "Hi,A sharp and shooting pain that seems to radiate to a certain part of your body may be nerve related.Is this pain similar to what you have experienced before?The pain of migraine is usually unilateral ,throbbing and may be associated with some neurologic symptoms like seeing spots of light (migraine aura).It is usually aggravated by loud noises or bright lights.Do you have any of these?What you may be having is\u00a0\u00a0neuralgia or neuropathic pain ( nerve related pain) that may be caused by infections ( herpes zoster), alcoholism, diabetes,trauma and certain medications.Are you a chronic alcohol drinker?How is your blood sugar level?A disk compression in the cervical spine may also cause a similar type of pain affecting the area that the nerve innervates.Neuropathic pain may be associated with a tingling and burning sensation.I suggest you consult with your neurologist so that your pain may be classified.A regular analgesic may not be able to help if this is nerve related pain.Further evaluation may be necessary to rule out involvement of the cervical spine as well as other underlying conditions like diabetes and nutritional disorders.I hope this helps.Keep in touch with us regarding your progress.",
