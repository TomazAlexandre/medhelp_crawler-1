            "answer": "we've already covered the urination issues in your previous post here.nothing else is a std related issue so this is not the appropriate forum for follow up.bottom line is - you\u00a0\u00a0have numerous health concerns so you will be best served by going to be seen and getting a proper work up done, not by posting on online forums.giving up the fast /fried foods and eating better is always a good thing. if you have a family\u00a0\u00a0history of diabetes you should be all you can to avoid repeating the pattern!\u00a0\u00a0Mom telling you to eat your veggies as a child was a good thing - just skip the meatloaf and have a nice salad with them instead :)",

    "question": "Ok so ive been doing some research and im down to this, I haven't had a blood test in a while (5yrs.) I'm a 25 M. and in the process of getting health insurance, I recently noticed the insides of my left and right eyes on the sclera have a dot of yellow not a lot just a dot. I haven't felt any fatigue that ive noticed am actually in very good shape externally, but I have noticed after foreplay and only at night and not all every time it only usually last around 1hr or usually never 2 hrs but sometimes, I\u00a0\u00a0have irritation when urinating not a strong irritation just one enough to let me know its there and throughout the duration I have to urinate frequently. Usually the first urination is normal but 2-4 times within the hour that I do its just a little tiny tiny bit. My question is, my moms side of the family is extremely diabetic and ive heard diabetes is carried throughout the female gene, so just wondering if this is something normal maybe im just over reacting, maybe high cholesterol? Im just curious on what the possibilities of it being\u00a0\u00a0A:STD or B:Diabetes or C: Normal. When I first noticed the yellow eyes a friend said its not normal and it usually means liver problems. My eating standards aren't really the up to par I eat a lot of fatty foods (trying to work on that) usually never eat greens or fruits used to drink alot alot alot of soda and stopped almost completely. I am a very stressed person when it comes to work and family, I get depressed pretty often usually when things dont go as planned, I did have head trauma back in 2001 when someone hit me on my motorcycle suffering front lobe damage fractured zagmatic arch and temple and severe spleen damage. At this point I am very calm I know that I need to see a doctor but as stated above waiting for HI. Ive done a lot of research online and pinned down most of my symptoms told my girlfriend about them and am just seeking some possible advice or guidance to better prepare myself for the situation. Anything is helpful thank you.",
