            "answer": "Dear zoe,It is unlikely that the chest pain is due to coronary artery blockages but not impossible.\u00a0\u00a0Other possible causes could be gastric reflux, musculoskeletal or neurologic.\u00a0\u00a0PVCs and PACs cause chest pain in some individuals. I would recommend making an appointment to see you doctor for further evaluation.",

            "answer": "Approximately three weeks ago, I was sent to the ER while I was at a routine office visit with my doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I had had some chest pain that day, sharp in duration the lasted about 15 minutes with indigestion.\u00a0\u00a0The nurse performed an EKG which showed some inverted T waves in one of the leads.\u00a0\u00a0I spent three hours in the ER, was given nitro, and was to return to the dr the following day.\u00a0\u00a0I went for my office visit to have an echo stress test.\u00a0\u00a0Before I actually started to walk my heart rate went up to 182 beats per minute and I was not allowed to walk.\u00a0\u00a0I was admitted as a 23 hour to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0The following day my heart rate was 60 and my doctor said I could go home.\u00a0\u00a0When I sat up my heart rate went up into the 120's.\u00a0\u00a0He then told me that I would have to wait and see the cardiologists.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors presume that Sudafed affected the conductivity of my heart.\u00a0\u00a0I have worn a Holter Monitor since then which showed I was having episodes of SVT.\u00a0\u00a0I also had a stress test and another echo.\u00a0\u00a0Structurally by the echo, my heart is normal.\u00a0\u00a0The baseline ekg, showed ST&T wave changes, q waves, etc and the nurse marked that I had an old inferior wall MI and an old lateral wall MI.\u00a0\u00a0The end result was \"Equivocal for Ischemia\"\u00a0\u00a0My cardiologist told me to exercise to strenghthen my heart, I met my target heart rate within 4 minutes and I should have gone 9. He also put me on Toprol 25 mg a day which my primary doctor told me yesterday he may need to increase.\u00a0\u00a0The cardiologist also stated he did not know why my heart was racing and assured me that everything is okay.\u00a0\u00a0But in view of my risk factors, my father died sudden death at 43, and as of 4 mos ago my cholesterol is high(I am to be put on medicine for that too) he wants to follow me closely.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have high blood pressure or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I am 35 years old.\u00a0\u00a0What questions do I need to ask.\u00a0\u00a0I seem to be getting a lot of contradictory information. Does the EKG reading really mean that I had a heart attack?",

    "question": "About 3 weeks ago I was having alot of flutters,skipped beats,and hard heart beat,that lasted for about 2 weeks.Then they dissapeared as quick as they appeared.I have had a couple more of these \"bouts\"in the past and even have seen a doctor that told me that my heart is fine and that it was stress.About 5 days ago I started having this buring feeling that would creep up and down my left arm just above the elbow and down to my wrist.I have no pressure or pain in my chest though,could this be angina even though there is no chest pain?When it first started it was much more intense and painful,now its much less painful but I still have it.I get it at rest,while driving,anything.Its not constant it comes and goes.Im scared now that this may have some conncection with what was going on with my heart.Im an active 30 year old female who exersizes regularly(yoga)",
