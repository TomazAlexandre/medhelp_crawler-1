            "answer": "Oh boy, I remember going through the same thing with my son. (He was diagnosed at 13 and is now 19.)\u00a0\u00a0I'd suggest getting a carb-counter booklet at a bookstore -- in the section of diet books -- many calorie counting books contain carb amounts too.My number one recommendation is: don't allow diabetes to change your son's life.\u00a0\u00a0We look at it as an inconveniece (to say the least,) but it hasn't changed anything my son would normally do.\u00a0\u00a0He's a lifeguard and does Tour de France style bike racing.It'll take a couple months to get used to carb counting and the ups and downs that go with diabetes, but you'll soon get into the swing of it and it won't be so intimidating.Good luck",

    "question": "My 11 year old son was diagnosed with diabetes only 2 days ago.Right now I am overwhelmed and on information overload. We\u00a0\u00a0are dealing with it so far but I feel helpless at times. For instance, tonight he wants to go out and eat but I'm not sure where to go. I've looked up nutritional info at many of the restaurants and I can find carb info for most of the fast food places but not so much for other places. How do you figure out the carbs for your smaller restaurants?",
