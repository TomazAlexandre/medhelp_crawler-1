            "answer": "ok...there are certains pills like the metformin..which help reduce hunger and automatically we tend to eat less thus our weight is controlled!! This works for me. I too was like you earlier but now by taking the med and controlling on food i have lost 1.2 kg in a week. You can definately try someother pill close to Metformin to be used. I had PCOS so the doc prescribed me that. But it is doing all good it can for me. Touch Wood. Also another trick is to keep your mind off food by indulging in some other activity that diverts your mind from food. It really helsp a lot. All the best.",

    "question": "I've tried every diet going and my weight goes up and down all the time. Im now the heaviest i've ever been at 13 stone. For about the last year now I have been hungry 90% of the time, I have cereal for breakfast and within 30 minutes im hungry again, i have a mid morning snack which doesnt fill a hole then i end up eating more for my lunch and within an hour ill still be hungry, it carries on like this up until my evening meal. Once ive had that which is never overly big I dont feel hungry again.Ive tried absolutely everything but the weight just wont shift, all my friends are very slim and can eat whatever they want without putting on weight and im getting to the stage where its dragging me down so much i dont even want to leave the house.The hardest thing for me is I have a very sweet tooth but I cant stomach fruit and veg. I will rarely eat grapes or pineapple but not very often and the only veg is carrots.\u00a0\u00a0Ive tried salads to help improve my diet but the taste/texture just makes me feel sick.I really dont know what to do now, I've had my Thyroid tested twice and both times its been fine and i've been put on pills by the doctor which have also had no effect.",
