    "question": "Hello everyone!My husband (who does not live with me anymore, we are separated) has cirrhosis and diabetes. He is 63. He does an injection in the morning and takes an insulin pill twice a day. He does not exercise, he does not sleep well and his eating habits are \"ok\". He has learned a lot about low carb eating, but his food \"quality\" is not great. He has neuropathy and cannot feel most of his feet. He still drinks alcohol \"in moderation\". At diagnosis six months ago, his blood sugar was at 600. His A1C was 18!\u00a0\u00a0It is now around 8My first question is that he reports to me his blood sugar. It used to be all over the board, but now it is always...ALWAYS at 99-102. No matter what. Is this possible? My dad had diabetes and his blood sugar fluctuated from normal range to high to low. He always had to check it to make sure he was doing ok.Second, when I asked him about his consistent blood sugar levels, I asked what he does \"if\" he wants to enjoy a meal that has carbohydrates (like pasta, etc). I know he still drinks because mutual friends and family tell me so. When he is out and had alcohol, he comes home to me and reports a normal blood sugar level.\u00a0\u00a0His response was that it was \"easy\", he just doubles up on his insulin.I am curious to see what your thoughts are.\u00a0\u00a0Is he in danger?\u00a0\u00a0Is he possibly lying about his consistently normal blood sugar levels? Does your blood sugar stay between 99-102 always?Thank you for your feedback!",
