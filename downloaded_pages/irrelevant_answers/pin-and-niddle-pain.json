            "answer": "Hi there. You need to be investigated for various causes of distal peripheral neuropathy. the various causes are vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, antiphospholipid antibodies to check the presence of any other familial autoimmune disorders since your two sisters have it\u00a0\u00a0etc. there is a familial preponderance for type 2 diabetes too. The other causes could be a cervical disc spondylosis, disc herniation, disc degeneration compressing the exiting nerve roots. Consult a neurologist and a rheumatologist for investigation of these various causes.\u00a0\u00a0Clinical evaluation, blood tests, and imaging studies like MRI spine would be required to ascertain the diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Therapy would be according to the cause. Take care.",
