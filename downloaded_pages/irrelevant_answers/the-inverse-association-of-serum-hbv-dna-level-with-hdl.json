    "question": "http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/228BACKGROUNDThe natural history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is complex and influenced by the level of viral replication and host factors. The hepatoprotective role of high density lipoproteins (HDL) and adiponectin as host factors on HBV persistence is less well understood.METHODSTo investigate correlation between HBV DNA level with clinical parameters in patients with chronic hepatitis B, 92 male subjects with HBV infection without any risk factors for diabetes were enrolled in this study. Age and BMI of the study population were matched and HBV DNA, ALT, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), adiponectin and lipid levels was measured.RESULTSSerum HBV DNA correlated inversely with serum HDL level (r = -0.23; P = 0.014). The median of log copies/ml for HBV DNA (3.67) was considered as cut off point. Patients with HBV DNA level higher than cut off point had lower adiponectin (8.7 \u00b1 5.3 vs 10.7 \u00b1 4.9 \u03bcg/ml p = 0.05). Also, adiponectin had a negative correlation with TNF-\u03b1 (r = -0.21, P = 0.04) and positive correlations with HDL (r = 0.18, P = 0.043).Multivariate regression models show that serum HDL level is an independed factor to predict serum HBV DNA.CONCLUSIONOur findings showed that higher HBV DNA levels are associated with lower HDL and adiponectin but induced TNF-alpha values.",
