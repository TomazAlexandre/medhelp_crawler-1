    "question": "I am a 42 year old female who has been suffering from chest discomfort off and on for about 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0I had a Cardiolite Stress and Echo done last month and they came out normal.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor said it was probably GI.\u00a0\u00a0Went to a GI doctor and had an endoscope done.\u00a0\u00a0He found Barrett's Esophagus.\u00a0\u00a0Placed me on some meds which are Prilosec 3 times a day and Propulsid 4 times a day.\u00a0\u00a0Had to get off of propulsid because of lower abdomen distress.\u00a0\u00a0I am still having the discomfort on Prilosec and the pain makes my lower gums ache. I am worried that maybe they missed something on my cardiac workup because my GI doctor said that he has never heard of Barrett's making a persons gums ache.\u00a0\u00a0A well meaning friend said that she thought maybe I was having angina.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be a possibility and could it have been overlooked on the stress test?\u00a0\u00a0Or can GI symptoms make your gums ache.\u00a0\u00a0I dont know what to think or do now. I was also told that I had a small Hiatel hernia.\u00a0\u00a0I dont have high blood pressure, diabetes ect...\u00a0\u00a0I do not get this pain on exertion.\u00a0\u00a0It just comes and goes no matter what I do.\u00a0\u00a0The other day, it lasted all day long.\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound more GI than cardiac?\u00a0\u00a0Please give me some direction on how to find answers on what is going on with me.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your time.",
