    "question": "My chances of developing diabetes are high, both my parents have diabetes, I got tested at 10 weeks and got normal results, at 16 weeks I got another test (due to having glucose on my urine) and my one hr came back slightly elevated 156/140 and had to do the 3 hr and got normal results! Today I eat at 9 am, I had a sprite with my meal, and I decided to check my blood sugar with my mom's machine, and to my surprise my reading came 99 after 3 hrs, it is a normal number right?? I'm 27 weeks 3 days!",
