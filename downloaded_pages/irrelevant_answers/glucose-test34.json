            "answer": "Unfortunately I scored too high on mine so I had to do the 3hr test and was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes :( great thing is I didn't require medication (guess I wasn't that bad). I had to see a nutritionist for a low carb diet and check my blood sugar few times a day and do NST and scans each week. I'm 5 weeks in the diet program and baby and I are doing perfect. He passes everything and is growing well. I'm 38w now:) hoping all goes well with you :)",
