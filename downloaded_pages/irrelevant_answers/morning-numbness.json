            "answer": "Actually, \"morning numbness\" is commonly associated with two conditions. Spinal stenosis and diabetes. With abnormal blood sugar levels in the morning the osmolality of tisues are affected, which causes fluid to exert pressure on nerves, causing numbness. After breakfast, as the sugar levels improves, the pressure relaxes and the numbness disappears. Thus, the first tests to take with \"morning numbness\" (assuming it is not positional are blood glucose and an hbcA1c. The \"trembling\" is also a flag for a blood sugar disorder. This does not mean that diabetes is your problem, but it's worth taking a few inexpensive tests to rule this condition out.",
