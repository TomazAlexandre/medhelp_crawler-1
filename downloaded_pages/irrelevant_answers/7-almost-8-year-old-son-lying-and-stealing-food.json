            "answer": "Was his TSH the only lab work that was ordered? If so, a sound place to begin is to assume that he behavior is rooted in a physiological basis. His pediatrician would likely order routine lab work (including blood and urine analyses), then perhaps refer your son for metabolic and endocrine studies. If all medical workupsprove negative, only then should it be considered that the behavior is driven by emotional, not physilogical, causes.",

He does seem thin for the amount of food he eats and he is super active. He did live with my mother for 3 weeks and when we got him back the issue became more noticeable.",

    "question": "My oldest son will be 8 in a few weeks, we are having a problem with him lying all the time and getting into food and sneaking it to his room. I have noticed this problem since he was 3 but then it was usually him trying to feed the dog peanut butter and bread so we didn't think to much into it.\u00a0\u00a0Lately it is getting worse and my husband and I are at the rock and the hard spot as to how we should handle this. The main problem is what he is eating foods high in sugar eg: the butterscotch topping for icecream, syrup, peanut butter, he will eat bread that is in the freezer down stairs, recently we found a can is pumpkin pie filling and a can of peach filling that he actually opened but said they didn't smell good so he didn't eat it hidden in his room. He will eat large amounts of sliced cheese (which we have to limit his dairy intake due to constipation) really anything that is in the house he will eat. He would even eat his sisters powdered formula when she little. The worse thing is his lying about it, I am concerned that he is going to consume something that will hurt him and since he lies about it we won't be able to find out what it is. We have had his thyroid checked and that is fine. He is not overweight and is in sports and very active we just need some ideas and are willing to try anything at this point",
