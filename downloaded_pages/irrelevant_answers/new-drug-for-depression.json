            "answer": "Good morning Marie...According to your medication list there are currently none that pose any drug interaction with Cymbalta. Your family or other caregivers should also be alert to changes in your mood or symptoms. Your doctor will need to check you at regular visits for at least the first 12 weeks of treatment. Make sure that you take this medication at the same time every day.I am very sorry to hear what you have been going through the past 2 years. It sounds like it's now behind you. As my mother always tells me...\"keep your pretty little chin up!:)",
