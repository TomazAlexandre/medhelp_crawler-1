            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.You can consult a cardiologist, as with long standing hypertension, there is an entity called diastolic dysfunction and this cannot be picked up by an ECG. You may need an ECHO to detect this. Breathlessness on exertion can also be due to decreased lung function. Lung function tests could further help in evaluation. Certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can also cause these symptoms. So, don't worry and discuss these options with your doctor.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
