            "answer": "The pancreas produces insulin and glucagon. Insulin lowers blood sugar, glucagon raises blood sugar. An enzyme (HMGCoA) controls the production of cholesterol in your liver. The hormones glucagon and insulin control the release of this enzyme. To control cholesterol production, you want to increase glucagon and decrease insulin. This is what statin drugs do.",

            "answer": "I focused on statins because they are getting all the blame this time around.\u00a0\u00a0But I'm finding that there are too many variables contributing to the onset of diabetes 2:\u00a0\u00a0overweight, lack of exercise, pregnancy, racial background, family history, etc., etc.\u00a0\u00a0I also don't rule out other meds, such as for high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0Some people can't keep their blood glucose numbers down; others can't keep theirs up.\u00a0\u00a0Too many variables.But there seems to be an epidemic of late-onset diabetes, not only in this country but around the world.\u00a0\u00a0There must be a common factor at work.\u00a0\u00a0The CDC puts it down to obesity.\u00a0\u00a0That just sounds too simplistic.I happen to subscribe to the theory of chemical-induced diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0This would include prescription drugs, illegal drugs, steroids.\u00a0\u00a0Everybody in the world is taking some kind or combination of drugs.I try to engage doctors and others in the medical community, such as diabetes educators, in conversation, and the answer always comes back that they balance the benefits vs. the risks in prescribing drugs.\u00a0\u00a0THAT'S JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME!\u00a0\u00a0 Sorry for shouting but this is MY health we're dealing with.\u00a0\u00a0There's too much God-playing among doctors -- an attitude that \"we know best\".\u00a0\u00a0If the heart doctor prescribes a med that helps the heart but kills the liver -- oh, well, that's not his problem.\u00a0\u00a0He fixed his area.I'm looking for medical experts with questing minds, who can keep an open mind and look for the common factor in this fast-growing \"trend\".\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, the chemical companies are raking in fortunes producing more and more drugs.",
