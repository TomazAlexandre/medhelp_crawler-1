            "answer": "Hi,Your EF is definitely low. Normally, the EF is 60% or more.Worsening of the EF depends on several factors. It commonly worsens when there\u2019s an acute stress on the heart. For e.g. during fever when the demands of the body tissues are more and heart is not able to meet the same, any sudden rhythm disturbances of the heart,any acute blockage in the coronary vessels which can result in a compromised blood supply, sudden surges in blood pressure which put an extra load on the heart muscle etc can result in a worsening of the EF.However, if one keeps the blood pressure under control, doesn\u2019t exert much (more than desired exercise), seeks a quick medical opinion in case of fever etc, then the heart failure/EF may not worsen.There are certain drugs which are supposed to improve the EF, e.g. ace inhibitors, digitalis (digoxin) etc. Hope you\u2019re already on these medicines.I sincerely hope that helps. Please do keep me posted. Kind Regards.",
