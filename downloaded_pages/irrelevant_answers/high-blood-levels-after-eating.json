            "answer": "I totally agree with the advice that has been given to you. Most articles that discuss normal ranges of blood sugar for people who are not diabetic list the range of \"normal\" as being between about 70-140. I believe that some doctors consider a blood sugar higher than about 150 after a meal as diabetic. So your son's sugar levels in the 200's do warrant some tests. We wish you the best.",
