            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Iron deficiency is the commonest cause of hair loss. Hair loss can also be due to dandruff, dermatitis, shampoos, oils, soaps, dust and dirt etc. Thyroid disorders and diabetes too could be a cause. Insomnia, stress and anxiety along with poor diet and excess of caffeine too can be the cause. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I'm 28 and for the last few years I've had hair loss. When it first started, there was a large bald spot in one section of my head. It finally grew back after several months but my hair (which was once extremely thick) is so thin. I go through periods of time where my hair will just start falling out.Also I have times where my arms ache really badly as if I have the flu. I also suffer from periods of insomnia and stay tired the majority of the time. If I drink too much caffeine, my hands shake really badly. My mind will race but body is still tired.I've cut down on caffeine.Is all of this related in some way? What do I need to do?",
