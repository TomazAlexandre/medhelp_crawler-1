            "answer": "You should get tested.Hepatitis C, as you mentioned , is very prevalent in Egypt. The main Hepatitis C Genotype in Egypt is Genotype 4. The reason that Egypt has such a high percentage of people with Hep C is due to a vaccination campaign several years ago in which unsterilized equipment was used in the vaccination process. In addition, Hep C can be spread by medical and dental procedures if the equipment is not properly sterilized between patients. Tattoos are a another means of transmission. Razors, diabetic testing equipment, nail clippers, should not be shared as they may have blood on them and may be a means of transmission.Because of the high prevalence of Hep C in Egypt, you and your family should be tested. You may very well have been exposed to the virus at some point in your life (most likely through medical or dental procedures using unsterilized equipment).Here are a few links that may contain information in which you may be interested:http://www2.hawaii.edu/~dewolfe/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6129a2.htmhttp://www.hcvadvocate.org/hcsp/articles/Egypt_06.htmlTomorrow I may add something about your other questions (concerning diabetes).",

            "answer": "Greetings I agree with much that has been said and just wanted to add that if you have not done so already you\u00a0\u00a0might want to consider getting vaccinated for Hepatitis A and B. Ask the testing facility (or whomever) about Twinrix. The Hep A vaccine is good for 20 - 25 years and if you get the HBV vaccine you will need a booster shot in a few months.You should also get typhoid (good for 3 years) and yellow fever vaccine which is good for 10 years.(Sorry - this is an American site)http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hav/havfaq.htm",

            "answer": "Yellow fever vaccine is not indicated in EgyptType 2 diabetes (which is mostly treated by tablets rather than insulin) is more common in patients with hepatitis C because the virus impairs the body response\u00a0\u00a0to insulin. About 30% of hepatitis C patients have diabetes specially those who are obese or more than 40 years old. Antiviral treatment is becoming more effective specially with the discovery of the new antivirus that is now added to interferon and repaverin. If the patient's diabetes was due to hepatitis C it well most probably greatly improve after treatment of hep C. In addition good control of diabetes might improve response to antiviral therapy (still to be tested in research).The problem of hep c treatment is the high probability of development of side effects, however, it greatly improves the prognosis of the individual.",

    "question": "My father in law was just diagnosed with Hep C. He already has insulin dependent diabetes. We have not gotten a biopsy yet so we do not know how far progressed the virus is. We also live in Egypt where I have seen that Hep C is more prevalent. I'm just looking for information on how Hep C progresses in someone that already has diabetes. And anything else we can do for him. Thank you in advance.",
