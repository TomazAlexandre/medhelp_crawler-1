    "question": "Got my female dog spayed (7months old) few days back. A few stitches opened after 5 days and the vet had to restitch it again. even after restitching, one of the stiches has opened within 24 hrs and the rest look fine. she has been confined to one place and\u00a0\u00a0a collar is being used to prevent her from biting or licking her stitches. is there a need for stitches again or some antibiotic can be used for the one stitch that has opened.",
