No matter what the outcome of the blood test is, getting him checked out will give you peace of mind, so I urge you to do this as soon as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you and please post again if you need us!",

            "answer": "Dear mcam,My son was diagnosed with type 1 at eight years old and his first symptom was excessive thirst.\u00a0\u00a0He also had a family history of type 1. Have you seen other symptoms, such as weightloss, being lethargic or even bedwetting? As a mom and not a doctor, from my own experience, if you have seen other possible symptoms I might recommend taking him to the e.r. to have a simple blood test. As gg suggested, better sooner than later and with the long weekend if you recognise other symptoms, it is better to get a proper diagnosis as soon as possible.Best wishes,dm",
