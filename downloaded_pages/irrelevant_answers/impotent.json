            "answer": "I am really sorry you are having this problem. I think many diabetic men suffer from this problem. At least, they talk about the men. Women with diabetes have it too but they can easier fake it, and they don't have to do what you need to do, and which is get a hard penis.The very best thing you can try is to get your blood sugars under as good as control as possible, and I am sure you already know that all.
