            "answer": "\"i checked my sugar, 4 hours after dinner and its 297\"Testing blood sugar four hours after a meal exceeds the postprandial testing time, should be between 2-3 hours maximum. If you had results of 297 mg/dl it's highly likely your postprandial was way higher than this and very dangerous level to be at. So, if you're thinking what should I do beside pop Victoza read on.Diabetes certainly can be progressive, but only if you let it progress to your ruin. Too many people rely solely on medication to make themselves normal when basic lifestyle changes are ignored. Both are needed. Changing lifestyle habits can go a long way in controlling type 2 diabetes. Restrict & avoid refined sugars, practice and adhere to weight control, do some sort of 30-60 min exercise daily, practice stress management, and get adequate sleep. These are all important in managing this illness, the most important, along with proper nutrition, is physical activity.Besides watching sugar in your diet-- you also need to watch carbohydrates [starches] carefully too. For example-- things like breads, potatoes, pasta, crackers, etc. can cause a drastic rise in your blood sugar if you aren't careful. [They are converted to sugar after you eat them]. Other foods/drinks need care too [example; milk, fruit, fruit juice] can also cause blood sugar to rise so serving sizes and moderation are extremely important. With fruit it\u2019s important to eat them with other foods to slow the absorption of fructose [fruit sugar]. Avoid tropical fruits, oranges, and grapes as these contain high amounts of fructose.\u00a0\u00a0I'm NOT saying that these foods aren't allowed. What I AM saying is that you need to use care and follow the guidelines for diabetics. Test, test, test. Test preprandial to get a baseline measurement then postprandial 2-3 hours after a meal to see how the foods you consumed affected your blood sugars. Testing is the only way you will know which foods are good for you and which ones you must avoid.Try to arrange an appointment with a Dietitian and/or Nutritionist. They can help you a lot with nutritional guidelines, serving sizes, and how many servings of each type food that's safe for you.Good luck -",

            "answer": "Thanks you replying. I know everything that makes my sugar worse.A diabetic can have anything in moderation. I got on a 'binge' of bad foods - i'm a stress eater.....crackers, pretzels, chips - sandwiches - french fries-all the bad stuff. I sabotoged myself :(\u00a0\u00a0oh and the 4 hours after.......i know was a long time. Wasn't home.My question was - how long does it take for the Victoza to start dropping the sugar levels? My doctor indicated it would 'show' a difference with the first dose. NOT so lol so i was very concerned.I got an answer on that yesterday from my pharmacist :)He says several days. You can't lower the sugar fast because it messes up the body worse than high sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Vistoza will lower it between 25 and 50 points per day. Which appears so far is what is happening. I had a reading of 227 yesterday morning. My reeadin this morning is 202 :) and this is only day 4 which i've not had meds yet this morning. So i look forward to another drop in readings tonight or in the morning. I'm going through strips like crazy checking which is a good thing for now.As for weight, i have lost 65+ pounds over the last 3 years and continue to lose a couple pounds each month even with the stress eating. I am about 15 pounds from my goal :)Again i appreciate your input :) its nice to have feedback while trying to get your head back on where it belongs lol Thanks !!!",

            "answer": "First, congrats on the weight loss and understanding what needs to be done to control and manage your diabetes. Now you just need to stay on the highway, not deviate to those bumpy side roads.\"A diabetic can have anything in moderation.\"Not necessarily true. For example, there are those t2'ers who cannot consume any fruits as fructose to their bodies is equivalent to table sugar. Close attention to the foods I mentioned earlier will make your path smoother.And, try to control your stress better as stress elevates blood sugars. There's an old saying, \"No worry, no stress\". And pul-eeze stop the \"binge\" eating. For every step forward it will set you back three. Keep working at it, in no time you will reach your goal.",
