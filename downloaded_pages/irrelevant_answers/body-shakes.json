This could be anxiety related, do you have a lot of stress in your life?\u00a0\u00a0This could be from dystonia- which is abnormal muscle contractions of the whole body or just one part.\u00a0\u00a0The shaking could be from being cold, from alcohol or medication especially corticosteroids, amphetamines, or stimulants such as diet pills.\u00a0\u00a0They could also be related to neurological issues such as seizures, Parkinson's or Huntington's disease.I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful.\u00a0\u00a0You really should make an appointment with your doctor to determine the exact cause and see if there is a treatment available to stop your problem.\u00a0\u00a0 Have A Wonderful Night!",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!It is possible to feel tremors all over the body. Tremors are often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, poor sleep patterns, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. Certain epilepsies too could be the cause. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Take care!",
