            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!One can feel very thirsty for hours together after a spicy or salty meal. Diarrhea, excessive sweating, exposure to excessive heat and sun can all cause polydipsia or excessive thirst.This can also be the result of diseases like diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. It can also be effect of certain medications but you are probably not on any.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0You can know more about this at your doctor\u2019s. Also you may need some tests like blood sugar. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0Wondered if anyone had any ideas before I book an appointment.About a week ago, I came down with some sort of bug.\u00a0\u00a0Dodgy stomach, headache and\u00a0\u00a0a bout of pretty vicious vomitting.\u00a0\u00a0I reckoned it sounded a bit like norovirus, so stayed away from work, went to bed and drunk lots of water.About a week later, still feel a bit 'ropey', but what I'm more interested in is the fact that I don't seem to be able to satisfy my thirst.\u00a0\u00a0I'm drinking lots of water, but my urine is still fairly yellow in colour (also looks like it has crystals in it! Maybe I'm imagining it).Generally I'm very fit and healthy having played sport all my life, so this is not something I'm prone to getting.Anyone any thoughts?",
