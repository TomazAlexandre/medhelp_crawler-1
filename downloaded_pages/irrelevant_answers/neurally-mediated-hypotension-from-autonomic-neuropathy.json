            "answer": "Hi there. The symptoms of dizziness or hypotension, bradycardia and shortness of breath do not make you more prone for a heat stroke. Though you may have dehydration due to heat stroke which can cause dizziness. You need a cardiac assessment for conditions like heart blocks where the heart rate is decreased causing hypotension as a result. Anemia could also be a cause for dizziness and shortness of breath on walking but there should be accompanying tachycardia in that case. Do you have any diabetes mellitus, vitamin B12 deficiency? Certain other conditions need to be ruled out as a cause for autonomic neuropathy and hence causing this hypotension and bradycardia. These are celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, uremia, drugs like pyridoxine, infections like lyme disease, rheumatois arthritis, autoimmune thyroiditis like hashimoto\u2019s disease. Consult your neurologist after the cardiac conditions have been ruled out. Take care.",
