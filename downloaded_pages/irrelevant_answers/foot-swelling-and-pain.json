I make my boyfriend rub my feet and legs and make sure i take lots of rests and put my feet up. I am in tears sometimes from the pain but so far my dr says its normal and probably just my tendon swelling since we could not see any outward swelling!",

Hope all is well with everyone.",

    "question": "Is there anyone else who is having this problem. For the last week my right foot has been in so much pain and so swollen that my tips of my toes are curling upward. The pain seems to be in my heel only on my right foot though. Feels as if it is bruised. When walking it swells so much that I have to sit down and rest because I can't take the pain in it anymore. Also the back of my left calf feels like I have a constant Charlie horse in it. Is there anything I can do to help have already tried soaking feet and legs in Epsom salt and it had not helped.",
