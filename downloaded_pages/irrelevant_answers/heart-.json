            "answer": "Hi, ejection fraction values below 35% are indicative of heart failure. If medical therapy fails, cardiac transplantation is recommended for all eligible patients with an LVEF below 20%\u00a0\u00a0regardless of clinical symptoms. It is difficult to predict the exact prognosis, as this depends on other co morbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension and the cause for the low ejection fraction values. Patients with heart failure have a 5-year mortality rate approaching 50 percent in some studies. Regards.",
