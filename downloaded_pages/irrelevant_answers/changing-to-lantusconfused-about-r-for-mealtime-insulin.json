            "answer": "Hi rootsluv,First of, let me remind you that we are not doctors but volunteers sharing their experiences with Type I Diabetes, so any advice you receive here should be followed up with a doctor.I applaud you for being involved and trying to help your boyfriend in managing his diabetes. As for his insulin doses: what were the recommendations given to him by his doctor? I'm sure he was must've been given recommended doses. Is he seeing an endocrinologist?There are step by step instructions on how to determine your blood sugar to insulin and blood sugar to carbohydrate ratio (as well as basal settings) on the insulin pumpers website: http://www.insulin-pumpers.org/howto/ratio.cgiI followed those myself before going on the pump and when I was on it my endocrinologist gave me guidelines on how to do it (I had to do it again to make sure the settings we had on my pump worked well) and it was pretty much the same way they have it on the website. It would be too long for me to tell you the details here so please check the above website for some guidance. It's all pretty much trial and error until you get it right. But, again, I suggest your boyfriend see an endocrinologist and work with the doctor on setting and adjusting his rates. On the side, though, 12 carbs to 1 unit seem reasonable (I'm 1 to 9 and many people seem to be between 8 and 15). Good luck to you and your boyfriend.",

            "answer": "Thanks so much. 12 is what we went with last night and it seems to be working pretty well. His doctor said to try 15...but we had already done 12 by the time that I spoke with her, and she said if that is doing good, then I should keep it there for now.\u00a0\u00a0Now, they are changing his mealtime insulin to Novalog and it is in pens...so, now we get to figure this out too. LOL I am so sympathetic towards diabetics. Especially type one. My aunt was diagnosed at age 7 and died at 32, b/c she didn't take care of herself. I love being involved and able to help. It gives me a great feeling. Thank you again for your response.",

            "answer": "I agree with the answer that was given, and it may take some time to fine-tune the ratio. Novalog and Humalog doses should be identical... they were for me when I switched, and I have heard others say the same thing.",

    "question": "My bf has been changes to Lantis one time at bedtime. It seem that he may be doing very well on it. The concern I have is about using Humulin R as your mealtime shot. I'm having trouble with how to know his carbohydrate-insulin ratio. I think I'm goind to start at 12 carbs/ 1 unit...Does this sound like a reasonable place to start? Also, what would be a good website to read up on this?",
