    "question": "In January I had UTI (blood in urine) which I was given antibiotics for. I also had a pain in my side below my right ribs. I went back 10 days later to be retested. Improved but still there. Went back a month later still positive. Urine culture no bacteria growth. I still had the pain in my side and gastro symptoms. My doctor sent me for a CT scan which showed small cyst in right ovary and prominent area of density in left side possible ureterocele. My dr. had me see my GYN who did an ultrasound for the cyst. He noticed my bladder was full But I didn't have a feeling to go. He had me go for another ultrasound for the cyst and again showed my bladder as still full right after I went. He sent me to a urologist who again did an ultrasound after I went and my bladder had 83cc urine retention. He did a urine test in his office (blood in urine) and then had me go for a urine cytology (I never got the results) and a cystoscopy which he said he did not see anything. I have an appointment with him in 2 weeks. I also had another ultrasound for the cyst (which is now gone) and the same thing happened with my bladder it was still full after going. I was able to empty it a second time after about 10 minutes.I have an underactive thyroid which was checked and is ok, was checked for diabetes which came out ok. I have been sick on and off since January, sore throats, just not feeling myself and then I had cellulitis in my leg 2 weeks ago which I took an antibiotic for.Right now I just feel bloated, crampy, very tired and have that pain in my side which is a crampy feeling and sometimes goes into my back. I also get pains in my lower back, especially when I am standing for a while.I know you can't diagnose me online but do you have any idea what can be causing my problems? I am just tired of continuously going to the doctor all the time and not coming up with any solutions. It's been almost 5 months. Also what do you suggest should be the next step? I am going back to the urologist in the beginning of June.",
