            "answer": "Diane,You're facing a tough situation, indeed, and it seems as tho' your son can benefit from more rigorous management of his diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0His control is poor if his blood sugar is so high -- so often as to miss more than 18 days of school in a year because of it.I dev'd diabetes as a teen (about 35 years ago now) before the days of home glucose monitoring, a1c tests, or intensive diabetes management.\u00a0\u00a0I can't remember missing school or work because of high blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I do remember having to take occasional \"time outs\" to treat a low blood sugar, but each such interruption is measured in minutes ...As an adult now, I understand how difficult it is for teens to feel and BE so different from what they perceive are \"carefree\" other teens.\u00a0\u00a0I'd encourage you to consider counseling -- family counseling is often helpfful since diabetes affects not just the diabetic, but also our siblings and parents -- with your son.\u00a0\u00a0A family couselor who has experience working with teens with chronic diseases would seem ideal.Emotions play a huge role in our abilities to accept our disease and to manage it well.\u00a0\u00a0A dx of diabetes is NOT a sentence to ill health in most cases.\u00a0\u00a0A dx of diabetes does, however require us to take on personal responsibility sooner rather than later.\u00a0\u00a0Resisting \"control\" is not uncommon among teens (they think it's their job ;-)\u00a0\u00a0) and yet learning to take control is key to their long term success, with or without diabetes.I can imagine how frustrated you are and perhaps your son is, too.\u00a0\u00a0Reading a LOT into what you've written, I wonder if he has begun to manipulate the adults in his life with this illness and the sooner you (plural) can reach the emotional core of his fear, anger, frustration, disappointment, jealousy, resentment, and exhaustion -- well, the sooner you will have your son back.\u00a0\u00a0My niece has been doing similar things, and at age 20, the family is still trying to \"reach\" her.\u00a0\u00a0The problem is not her diabetes; it's her emotional adjustment (or rather, the lack thereof).While I'm sure it's tempting to want to \"fix\" the problem with his not getting school credit, I think that that issue is minor compared to reaching your son's emotional engine and helping him to begin to heal himself.\u00a0\u00a0Until that happens, you may find yourselves faced with this type of escalating problem for a long time.\u00a0\u00a0At the same time as you consider reaching out nurture his pain & fears, it may be time to evaluate your medical care teams, as well.\u00a0\u00a0Is he being followed by an endocrinologist or a diabetologist?\u00a0\u00a0Both specialize in the care of folks with diseases like DM.\u00a0\u00a0Does he have a diabetes educator to help work out daily details like having foods he likes, planning for and ENJOYING safe social times, etc?Diane, I realize you asked for help with working with the school and my answer has addressed little in that regard.\u00a0\u00a0My sense is that your son has missed enough of school work to have *earned* no credit -- and that's a bitter pill to swallow, indeed.\u00a0\u00a0Might that bitter pill help him to face what he ultimately must face?\u00a0\u00a0With your support, he can do much much better - tho' it may take months or years for him to adjust.\u00a0\u00a0In the school, it may be helpful for you to meet with the nurse and with the principal & guidance couselor to explain the situation.\u00a0\u00a0I'm nearly certain they've all worked with diabetic students before -- tho' perhaps the ones they've worked with before had already come to terms with managing it.I hope that others will chime in here, too.\u00a0\u00a0Several folks are teens/young adults and several are the parents.\u00a0\u00a0If you'd like to have 1:1 support, which can be much more personal that what we can do here, remember to visit www.jdrf.org and click on the Online Diabetes Support Team.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, while I consider myself fairly knowledgable about diabetes issues, I'm not a physician, so please talk honestly with your doc (or new doc) about your son's situation ... and talk with your son, too.\u00a0\u00a0He might just believe taht feeling lousy (and high blood sugar feels VERY lousy!) is what he should expect.\u00a0\u00a0The truth is, he should expect to feel pretty terrific most of the time -- well-controlled blood sugar and normal emotional health provide that result.Good luck, Diane.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that my directness has not offended you -- that's not my intent.\u00a0\u00a0I'm hoping to show you that things can be different .. and decidedly better ... if you, your son and all those on his team can face the demons that're getting in the way.\u00a0\u00a0GOod luck and please do check back & let us know how things're going.\u00a0\u00a0You're not alone.",

            "answer": "I am the mother of a 16 year old, about to be a senior, who was diagnosed in February. Her school has been incredibly helpful and I probably didn't need it, but we implemented a \"504\" plan, which protects her from absent and tardy issues, as well as allowing her to leave class when she has to... extra time for homework assignments if needed, extra time on tests if she's having sugar problems... a whole range of protection.This is federal, not state, so it's something you should look into immediately.http://www.chtu.org/504.htmlGood Luck,Barbara",

    "question": "My son is age 17 and diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 11.\u00a0\u00a0He has many hyperglycemic episodes and has missed excessive amounts of class time.\u00a0\u00a0Our high school limit for absences if 18.\u00a0\u00a0He has well over this amount.\u00a0\u00a0The school is wanting to deny him credit for classes because of the absenteeism.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think this is fair because of the high blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately I do not have a doctor's statement to support each occurence of the hyperglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate any suggestions you many have to help me confront this issue with his school.",
