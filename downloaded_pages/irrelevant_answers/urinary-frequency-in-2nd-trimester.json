            "answer": "You know, I'm wondering if you're right about it just being a bad scan...if the baby was all curled up, how can you get an accurate head-to-rump measurement? That said - I would think that if you had GD, the baby would measure *bigger than normal. As for the potty....OMG, I go CONSTANTLY. Probably at least 3-4 times a night and several times throughout the day. I was just diagnosed with GD last week, and I'm 23 weeks today. So it is definately early for a diagnosis, but I guess the MD knew what he was doing.. They tested me early because of my risk factors...already overweight, family history of diabetes, my age, and my last baby was very large. It was kind of borderline...the actual test itself was officially negative. But the doctor was being cautious, and had me go to a nutritionist and start tracking my blood sugar. We found that I was slightly high...usually about 150 after meals. The MD wanted it at 140 or less an hour after eating, and below 90 in the morning after fasting. After about ten days, we found that I could control the blood sugar during the day pretty well with diet...but my fasting blood sugar was right around 100 every morning. And there was nothing I could do about that. So the doctor put me on 5 units (a very small dose) of insulin every night before bed. I started last Thursday, and it seems to have done the trick. My BS was well below 90 every morning since then, and I haven't had one reading over 140 at all during the day.Anyway...long answer. Sorry. LOL. But, it could be you have GD. Do you have any other risk factors, other than age? I don't see why the MD wouldn't go ahead and test you.Tricia",

            "answer": "Oh no I don't mind it being a long answer..thank you for your answer...it was very helpful.I go back in a couple weeks for another\u00a0\u00a0ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0Although I'd be happier if it were in a week.I had thought having GD made the babies bigger too.\u00a0\u00a0And I suppose that's probably the case..but in my Mayo Pregnancy Book it listed GD as being a culprit of small for gesatational age too....so I dunno...didn't make sense to me either.\u00a0\u00a0However, when I read about symptoms of GD it listed the urinary frequency, thirst and something else that I've got going on too.\u00a0\u00a0But that's hard to tell if it's pregnancy related or from me drinking water.Well I guess I will just ride this one out.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I'm glad to hear you're hitting the potty 3-4 times at night too.\u00a0\u00a0I was beginnning to think something was wrong.",

    "question": "Is this still an issue with anyone...having to go to the bathroom a lot.\u00a0\u00a0 I am constantly going even in the middle of the night.\u00a0\u00a0I think I go to the bathroom about every 2 to 3 hours.\u00a0\u00a0 i'm am concered about this since I think I may have undiagnosed gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or maybe it's due to the fact that i've been trying to get down 64oz of water per day.SoCalTricia....if you are reading this...at one time did you say they checked you for gestatonal diabetes earlier than normal.\u00a0\u00a0 I asked the nurse to check me for this.I'm just concerned because at the Level II ultrasound, I was told the baby was two weeks behind.\u00a0\u00a0I don't get it.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't have any issues at the NT scan a couple of weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0Or it could have just been a bad L2 scan....they baby wasn't very cooperative.\u00a0\u00a0They couldn't even tell gender.\u00a0\u00a0 Baby was in a curled up position, was alseep and wouldn't wake up.\u00a0\u00a0So now I have diagnosis of small for gestational age.I don't do other things that cause SGA, just wonder if GD or placental issues.\u00a0\u00a0Althought I'm taking Lovenox twice a day, I should have clotting issues that are interferring with oxygen and nutrients going through placenta.",
