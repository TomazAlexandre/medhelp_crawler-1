            "answer": "I have had tons of fluid with all my pregnancies but more so with my last. They couldnt find the reason for but told me it was more than likely that I had GD. I failed the one hour but passed the two hour so as far as im consered I didnt have GD. They also told me my baby was HUGE! 9lbs 12 ozs at my 37 week u/s. she was born a few days later weighing 7 lbs 6 ozs, lol! Given the amount of fluid you have can throw off the accuartcy of their weight est. I had normal vag deliverys with all 4 of my babies. My last was the longest. My water broke in the early AM and I had her around noon:) She was also the only baby my waters broke with................could have been because I just had sooooo much, lol!",

    "question": "I had my ultrasound today and im 33 wk 3 days and baby is measuring 5.15 # so he'll probably be a big boy! My question is she said i had a lot of amniotic fluid not scary a lot but definately more than normal. She is giving my results to my midwife so she can decide if she wants to do more testing. I dont have gestational diabetes whicj she said could be a cause, did any of you have a lot of fluid and find out why? She wasnt very detailed in possible reasons just ssid it could be nothing or it could be something to do w his swallowing or infection. My younhest was born w a serious infection and they never found out for sure why said it was possible i had a slow leak but they were nevet certain. Anyways would love some input!! Thanxx- rachel",
