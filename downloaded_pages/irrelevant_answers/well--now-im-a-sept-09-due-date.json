            "answer": "well, i have high blood pressure which has mostly been controlled during pregnancy (had it since 27) its creeping up - dosage was doubled four weeks ago. i have gestational diabetes since 14 weeks controlled by insulin. i have swelling in my hands and feet but my weekly nst / urine / blood tests are not indicating pre-e (yet).\u00a0\u00a0I'm 39.my usound last week showed that the baby is smallish (below 50 percentile) which I don't think is a hugely big deal except for the fact that i have gd so that's a little unusual. my insulin needs started to decrease a couple of weeks ago so that may be an indication of placental breakdown.when you put everything together she's not willing to risk something happening to the baby by leaving her in longer. i think she would have taken her out last tuesday if she had her way but i was 36 weeks.i'm a little bit in shock, plus i'm not looking forward to a c-section but that was always the mostly likely of the two options - baby spent most of the preg transverse, seemed to go head down a few weeks ago but has now gone back to transverse.\u00a0\u00a0I have a lg fibroid which may be in the way and at my appt yesterday my cervix was totally closed so induction would be tricky.",
