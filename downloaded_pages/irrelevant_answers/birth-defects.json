            "answer": "No.... only about 80% of birth defects are detectable on a u/s. I seriously don't think eating too much candy can cause birth defects although the sugar intake can't be healthy for you or the baby, and might contribute to developing gestational diabetes which can cause many complications for you and the baby during and after birth.",

            "answer": "Yes, don't eat too much sugar. At the beginning of my pregnancy, I thought I was being good by switching from soda to juice. Well, I picked the wrong juice and it was packed with sugar. My urine sample was LOADED with sugar and the doc was very worried. So now I make sure all the juice I drink is 100% juice with natural sugars only, and I usually combine it with 1/2 water. If it was a one time event of eating too much candy, you will be fine and baby will be fine, but don't make it a habit.",

            "answer": "The urine test is just a quick look. To really diagnose gestational diabetes they do a glucose tolerance test (at about the time you are at now). I don't know the effects of the excess sugar as I am not a doctor, I just know that my doctor told me to stay away from too much sweet stuff and I am listening. It will just make the sweet stuff so much better after the baby is born.But remember that what you eat DOES effect the baby as it goes into his bloodstream. I just don't know the specific effects.",
