            "answer": "Hello,If you have a history of high blood pressure, the Left ventricular thicking aka Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) is most likely a result of your heart thickening due to elevated blood pressure.If blood pressure is not well controlled, the heart muscle can thicken as a result of having to pump against higher pressures. The best thing to do for this is to make sure that your blood pressure is well controlled. There are other causes of thickening of the ventricle like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and aortic valve stenosis, but those things would have likely be seen on the echocardiogram and would have been mentioned by your doctor. The best thing you can do to decrease your chance of having heart problems in the futre would be to stop smoking, control your blood pressure and diabetes, and lose weight if obesity is an issue.",
