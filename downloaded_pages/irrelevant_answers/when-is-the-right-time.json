            "answer": "Not sure if I understand your question. Are you wanting to get off of the vicodin? If so, can you please let us know how many you are taking a day and what mg. Giving us this info can help us prepare you for what is to come. Have you considered tapering? It takes so much willpower but can help the withdrawals be less severe. There is also a pain management forum along with a forum for people that have fibro. At the top of the page click on forums. It will bring up a list of all of the forums that med help has to offer. You may be able to get some ideas on what other people are doing to control their pain.Brian",
