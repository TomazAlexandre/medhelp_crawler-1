            "answer": "Vicki, I would concur with kenkeith, you probably need to make some changes.\u00a0\u00a0Your LDL level suggests a high fat diet and/or familial high cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0A drug like Vytorin controls both these types of cholesterol, at least it did in my case.\u00a0\u00a0I had levels like that and tried through diet alone to control my cholesterol and ended up with lots of heart trouble.\u00a0\u00a0Also, the retinopathy diagnosis is disturbing.\u00a0\u00a0It can be caused by diabetes but from high blood pressure as well.I'm betting your doctor will prescribe cholesterol meds, maybe high blood pressure medications as well.\u00a0\u00a0Given your young age, this could just be the wakeup call you needed to prevent vision issues and heart trouble.Keep up informed.",

            "answer": "I tend to agree, your first priority should be to lower your LDL to under 100, which is the guideline for some one at high risk of CAD due to a family history. Start with your diet, cut out empty carbs like sugars, breads and pasta. Also, lower your fat intake. Then get some exercise, min of 45 - 60 mins of cardio per day. I would retest in 90 days and if you don't see any improvement you need to look into a statin. This was the case with me, even after losing 70 pounds I still had a high level of LDL. I've been on a statin for many years and my numbers are under control and I have had no side effects.I hope this helps,Jon",
