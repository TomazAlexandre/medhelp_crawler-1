            "answer": "Hello. Are you having any other symptoms besides numbness and tingling? I think you should contact your healthcare provider immediately. There are many possible causes as to why you are feeling tingling and numbness. There could be a malfunction in nerves transmission, could be due to diabetes, electrolyte imbalances, hormonal imbalances, or some type of neurological problems. It's better to go to your doctor so they can help you rather than wait any longer and hope that it will go away.",

Check out my posts in late 2007 where I reported on my visit with my neurologist. I think you might find it helpful if you are as I described above. Cheers,",
