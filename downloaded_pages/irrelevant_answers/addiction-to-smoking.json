            "answer": "Hi there David & Welcome ;)Addictions gradually negatively impact almost all areas of our lives as they tend to overshadow the importance of everything else, affect our bodies & (most importantly) change our relationship with our emotions & thoughts. Sex is linked to all three (the physical/emotional & mental.)What's going on? Can you tell us a little bit more about yourself? What sort of drugs are we talking about here?",

            "answer": "The rush of winning the high stakes black jack game or having an orgasm, slamming H or runners high all have a lot in common. Drugs induce that euphoria and pleasure when one first starts taking them, then gamble or have sex and it amifies it. As tolerance builds, the amount of natural chemistry sex can flood the brain is not enough goodies to even feel satisfied. I even noticed feiends who did lots of MDMA couldn't even get aroused for sex, even though they were high, after awhile. Since I got off drugs, it took a long time for me to be able to see why my libido was dead. Took away the drugs, I went through phases, felt like I passed through ages 14-30 again as I healed. Hyper sexuality is common in early recovery. Knowing very little, all this is based on the assumption drugs are the problem, but EvolverU made some excellent points about other causes too. Do you have a tolerance to your drug of choice? Tell us a little more and we'll tell you what we think anyway. I'm a bipolar 1 methadone addict, I'm getting better all the time though, if that helps you feel more comfortable sharing.",
