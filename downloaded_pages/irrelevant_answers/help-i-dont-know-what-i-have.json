            "answer": "Hi Christine,You might want to get tested for diabetes. Some of your symptoms do point in that direction. It's very difficult to deal with the fact that you know something isn't right but you just can't figure out what is causing all these symptoms. I would also suggest to see your doctor to get a full physical including urine samples and blood work.Good luck with everything and keep us posted!Sophie",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!The symptoms could be due to uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Especially if you have a family history of diabetes, this should be looked into. There is a possibility that diabetes affected your kidney and this is causing water retention.The other possibility is diabetes insipidus which happens due to adrenal gland dysfunction. Polycystic disease of the ovary is another possibility that causes resistance to insulin and high glucose levels causing similar symptoms.It is difficult to comment beyond this on net. You may need to consult an internal medicine specialist regarding this.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
