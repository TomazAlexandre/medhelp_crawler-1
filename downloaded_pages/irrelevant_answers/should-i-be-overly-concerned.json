            "answer": "In first note I meant 2-3 times a day. But doctor what other causes could there be to the fast heart rate and the feelings I've been experiencing. Also when these fast heart rates come on it gives me the feeling like I should go to the bathroom. These episodes may last all night or only for an hour...any thoughts. I'm going to see my cardiologist today!!",

            "answer": "I thank you for your input Dr. if it is atrial flutter or an arythmia what course do I have treatment wise? Also sometimes now when I get these wierd sensations my heart rate is'nt really high its in the 90-100bpm range sometimes less. I have noticed and the doctor that performed my physical has told me I have an arythmia associated with my breathing...slows down when I breathe out and speeds up when I inhale...any comments??",

    "question": "I have written in before about several bouts I have had with Atrial flutter over the last 3 years..but am wondering if I am getting used to it or what? I am getting fast heart rates quite often 203 times daily and mostly noticeable at night...making it very hard to sleep. Now it seems my heart rate is at about 75-85 bpm. My normal hr is 60-70bpm. When this phenomenon comes on seems like I get a tingling in my chest(upper) and in my left shoulder near the shoulder joint. Its not pain but more tingling or like someone is touching me there! Sometimes I get a wierd sensation as though my arms are kind of vibrating or making small cemicercles but my arms aren't moving. Along with the wierd feeling of being really anxious or nervous. These episodes are very troublesome as I ofcourse think I am having a heart attack. I have seen my physician for a physical and he says cholesterol levels are great, no diabetes or problem with my thyroid. Any Ideas what this may be .. Thanks",
