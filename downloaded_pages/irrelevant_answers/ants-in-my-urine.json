            "answer": "Hello,Polyuria\u00a0\u00a0or frequent micturition is an important symptom of diabetes. Further gathering of ants around urine was one of the very early methods of investigating diabetes when there were no blood tests in picture. My sincere advice would be to consult a physician and get blood sugar tests(fasting and post prandial) and Hb A1c done to know the status of your diabetes.Hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
