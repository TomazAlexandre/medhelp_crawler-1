            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.The localized skin irritation or tingling could be due the paresthesia after diabetic neuropathy. This neuropathy appears as a tingling sensation on skins and appears after long standing diabetes. Another possibility could be any pinched nerve in spine. If you suffer continuous tingling sensation on skin of leg, please arrange an appointment with a neurologist right away who will evaluate the possibilities here and can provide you an appropriate treatment. Hope this information proves helpful to you. Take Care & Regards!!!",

            "answer": "Thank you so much may I ask you a question. I have the head and back pressure much more then the tingling could that mean this is more spine related instead of neuropathy? I saw my Neurologist and he claims this is all from diabetes but I don't agree specially with the pressure I am getting.",
