            "answer": "Statins lower cholesterol, but only with adverse affects on the liver and kidneys. And yet, all the studies show that it is not cholesterol that causes strokes and heart attacks, but rather INFLAMMATION. If your risk factors are within acceptable ranges, skip the statins.Doctors have been trying to get me on statins for 15 years now, and I refuse. My good cholesterol is 75, which offsets by bad at 105-110. Triglycerides are in the 60s and overall cholesterol 190-200.I have well-controlled diabetes and an artificial heart valve; hence my risk for stroke and heart attack are high, so say the manufactures of statins -- the same companies that determine the standards for use. They are even trying to get perfectly healthychildren on statins. Doctors need to study up on the risks.",
