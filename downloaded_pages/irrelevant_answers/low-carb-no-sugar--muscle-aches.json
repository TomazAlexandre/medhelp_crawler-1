            "answer": "Went through the same thing. Diabetes made me really thirsty. As a result, I drank a lot of water, diet soda and juice. This caused me to flush out all of the vitamins and minerals of my body. I am reallllly low on just about everything. Just started suplements and a big daily dose of magnesium as suggested by my nutritionist. Since I've eaten very low carbs and kept my sugar lower in addition to the supplements, the cramps are gone.",

            "answer": "Consume high-potassium foods such as fruits (specifically, avocados, apricots, bananas, dates, nectarines, oranges, raisins), vegetables (specifically artichokes, parsnips, spinach, tomatoes, yams), whole grains, molasses, clams, cod, halibut, yogurt, and nuts. Low potassium can lead to problems with your muscles and heart. Too much potassium can lead to irregular heartbeats.Too much magnesium, on the other hand, will give you loose bowels. High levels of magnesium in the blood can lead to heart problems or an inability to breathe, especially in people with kidney disease. A list of high magnesium foods can be found here http://tinyurl.com/5yxqne .Prior to taking vitamin and mineral supplements its always a good idea to get tested first to see where your body stands. Discuss the results with your doctor to understand your limitations.",

            "answer": "Low potassium usually causes leg cramps....usually on the calves.\u00a0\u00a0Cramping, not muscle aches.Low magnesium is associated with having diabetes but the symptoms of magnesium deficiency may include muscle spasms and weakness but not really muscle aches.As WaveRider says, before you take supplements, ask your doctor to check to see if you really need them.\u00a0\u00a0Taking something you may not need may cause problems.The muscle aches may be caused by poor diet.\u00a0\u00a0If your protein intake is too low, your body uses muscle as energy.The fact that you say you're on a \"low carb NO SUGAR diet\" sort of makes me think that you would benefit from seeing a Dietician or Diabetes Educator.\u00a0\u00a0You see, there's no such thing as a \"NO SUGAR DIET\" because EVERYTHING we eat turns into SUGAR.\u00a0\u00a0EVERYTHING....no matter what it is.\u00a0\u00a0Some things (like carbs) turn into sugar faster than others (like protein), but eventually, anything that contains calories turns into sugar.",
