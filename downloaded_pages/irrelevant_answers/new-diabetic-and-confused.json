            "answer": "The first diet you could try to help control your symptoms is a gluten free diet.\u00a0\u00a0A gluten free diet is a diet free of wheat, barley, rye and possibly oats.\u00a0\u00a0A gluten intolerance (which is when someone doesn't have the enzymes or not enough enzymes to break down the gluten in the above foods) can cause all of your above symptoms - PCOS, RA, hypoglycemia, etc.\u00a0\u00a0It's easy to look this up on the internet.\u00a0\u00a0If you'd like to give the diet a try, make sure you take a gluten free multivitamin (like NatureMade brand) and that your medicines don't have gluten.\u00a0\u00a0If you need help, just leave me a message.Another diet you can try is a low carb diet like the Atkins diet - you can find the books on Amazon.com or go to your local library. The diet for PCOS is a low carb diet - people with PCOS have an insulin problem, which is helped with this diet along with metformin.\u00a0\u00a0I would also eliminate gluten along with the low carb diet.\u00a0\u00a0If you try the low carb diet, make sure you take the recommended nutrients.\u00a0\u00a0They are recommended for a reason.\u00a0\u00a0And some people get silly with the diet and don't take in any carbs - DON'T DO THAT!\u00a0\u00a0Maybe you can call your doctor to make sure this diet is safe for you.",

            "answer": "I agree with the above.\u00a0\u00a0The gluten free diet is much easier lately as even walmart has a section of gluten free.\u00a0\u00a0 We have a store that labels each item that is gluten free in their store (and they are a big one).\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms are widerange and act like many other diseases.\u00a0\u00a0My\u00a0\u00a0ggrandaughter was diagnosed and she went from awful to a perfectly normal healthy child...her mom said --gramma try this.\u00a0\u00a0It was amazing!!.\u00a0\u00a0It makes a huge difference in less than a week.The other comment is when I went on metformin i had these symptoms and was changed to a different med..take less and controls well.(glyburide).God bless and good luck",

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with Diabetes. I was Hypoglycemic for many years. I have been having issues with severe stomach pain, bowel issues, and nausea every time I eat. I am eating healthy and trying to do everything right. I take Metformin 500mg 2x a day and will start 1000mg 2x a day in a couple more days. I also have RA, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, and Hyperplasia. Could you explain why this is happening or what I can do about it?
