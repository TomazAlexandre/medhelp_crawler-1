            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Post viral fatigue syndrome is probably what you have and this is a very common disorder. Also there are no magic pills for it. This can be treated patiently with exercise, good diet, work out plans and multivitamins. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables and proteins should be taken along with a multi vitamin supplement. Eat 5-7 small regular meals every day. Drink plenty of water. Do deep breathing exercises.Along with it check for EBV infection, tuberculosis, and allergy as all can cause persisting cough and chest infection. Low Vit B12 and Vit D, hypothyroidism and diabetes should also be looked into.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

A number of your symptoms match my husband's who has sleep apnea. His health at that time before using his breathing machine resembles your health now.",

    "question": "Hello Forum,I'm a 36 year old male: 15 months ago I came down with bronchitis like symptoms and ignored the illness for\u00a0\u00a0nearly 2 months before finally going to the doctor and taking antibiotics. After these antibiotics (acithromycin), I became much worse and suffered sweats, chills, neuralgia, bad headaches, pain in my upper left arm, heart palpitations, stomach pain, burning in my chest and abdomen and had had trouble with sleeping for almost two months. My lower back and chest started to click which never happened before. I feel as if my upper torso is 'glued' together and have pain throughout my upper body. I have tried several medicines inluding more broad spectrum antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors for acid reflux and have seen several alternative medicine practioners who have prescribed a whole range of treatment plans but I'm still unwell. The most dominant symptom for the previous few months is a heat type pain in my chest and abdomen with chest pain. Any insights would be greatly appreciated.",
