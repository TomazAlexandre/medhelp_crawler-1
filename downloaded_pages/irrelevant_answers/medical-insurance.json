            "answer": "Hi Mindy,From what I understand, it is a challenge to get health insurance if you're diabetic, but not impossible. Here are a couple of links to explore:http://www.diabetes.org/advocacy-and-legalresources/healthcare/insurance.jsphttp://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/financialhelp/http://www.ncsl.org/programs/health/diabetes.htmIt used to be pretty much impossible to get health insurance if you had diabetes, but 47 states now have laws that require insurers to offer some sort of diabetic coverage. If you're unemployed, Medicaid is also a possible source of help, so check there.Good luck.",
