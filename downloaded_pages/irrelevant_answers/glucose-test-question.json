I did not have the shakes, but I was nauseated and vommited, and hot flashes. I think it is normal, at least that is what my Dr told me. What made it worse is I had to go back and take the 3 hr!!!!!!!!! Just lay down in a cool room with a damp cool wash cloth on your head and maybe take a nap if possible. I hope you feel better soon!",
