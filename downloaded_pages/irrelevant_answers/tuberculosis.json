            "answer": "Hi and sorry your Boyfriend's mother has possibly contracted TB. It is possible that her immune system is low at that age and she didn't have a positive skin test. Didn't they do a chest Xray? Usually, that is another diagnostic tool they can use. The second sputum should help. It may have been early in the disease to get a positive culture and that may be why one was positive the other negative. These bacteria grow very slowly.I wouldn't worry about dust as a way to get TB. This is more for factory workers that work with silica and other harmful particles. Is she diabetic? Sometimes that makes them even more susceptible to getting TB.Usually, a mask can help when being around her for a long time and good hand washing. Also you can change clothes or buy some disposable gowns if caring for her. Don't drink after her. They say if she is spitting up or coughing up sputum to cough it into a disposable cup or paper towel or napkin and ask the doctor how to disgard these. They may give you some infectious material bags or something like that. Once they start treatment if she is positive, then you can ask the doctor how long until it is safe to not wear the mask. Usually, they do several cultures in a row and when 3 in a row are negative after treatment they are clear to be released. She has to take the multiple antibiotics even if it makes her sick if she has it. If she stops she can get a resistant strain of TB and of course not cure the TB as it will come back.Let me know if you have any other questions. I hope she is negative. But I would get the Xray done and probalby follow up again if her Xray is positive I would follow up with another culture in about a month or so.",

            "answer": "They did a chest xray and saw something so that is why they started to test the sputum for TB.\u00a0\u00a0She does have diabetes but I thought it was pretty contagious regardless.\u00a0\u00a0I hope not because her boyfriend has been pretty close to her and he has bronchitis at the moment so his immune system is compromised as well.\u00a0\u00a0He drove her to the hospital initially when she just kept getting worse.\u00a0\u00a0He is staying away now so as not to catch it or give her his illness though I implored him to be mindful and be tested as well since he was likely in close quarters with her in the car when she was coughing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not know it was slow to grow and that if she stops treatment she can complicate things.\u00a0\u00a0I will make sure she is fully aware.\u00a0\u00a0She is not improving after being sick for over two weeks so that is a bit concerning but she is also not likely on proper antibiotics.\u00a0\u00a0At this point she is at home but hope she goes back into the hospital if it does come back positive.\u00a0\u00a0She is feeling very weak though she has been able to get up and make herself something to eat.\u00a0\u00a0Good to know about the dust.\u00a0\u00a0She is very clean anyways but good to know it isn't a huge concern.\u00a0\u00a0 Is a person contagious before they show symptoms or only after they start to cough?",

Just found out that another person she knows who was in Mexico was flown home with a lung infection though from what it sounds this strain is usually only contracted by older folks and those with weakened immune systems but I will say she has complained of feeling tired for quite a while before she even got really sick so maybe she was developing in for some time now.\u00a0\u00a0It also sounds like she will have to be on medicine for at least a year same as TB.\u00a0\u00a0Good news is she did stop coughing so that is improvement but she still complains of being not just tired now but super weak.\u00a0\u00a0Not great news but at least it isn't TB.",

    "question": "My boyfriend's mother may have TB.\u00a0\u00a0She came home from Mexico and about 4 or so days later started to feel sick.\u00a0\u00a0She did not seek medical help for almost 2 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0While in the hospital they ran a skin test and a first sputum test that came back negative for TB.\u00a0\u00a0They sent her home diagnosed as viral pneumonia but then called and said the 2nd sputum test was positive.\u00a0\u00a0They are awaiting a 3rd sputum test to definitively diagnose it as TB. She is in her 80s and I have read that the skin test for older folks can come back negative but was a bit surprised the first sputum test was negative so it makes me question if she does indeed have it but. this said, I do have some questions just in case.I have done some initial research online about how it is caught and that it is mainly transmitted via breathing it in but how easy is it to catch?\u00a0\u00a0My boyfriend wore a mask around her in the hospital but when they sent her home he spent a few hours at her house without a mask.\u00a0\u00a0Should he be tested?If a person were to wear a mask around an infected person is that a pretty reliable safe guard for catching it?\u00a0\u00a0If she stays home alone in isolation she may still need someone to bring her food and medicine so just want to be sure what the safe practice would be.How long is a person contagious if they do have it and how long is their environment contaminated?\u00a0\u00a0I read that the bacteria can persist in dusk particles for months.\u00a0\u00a0She is a very clean person so she likely doesn't have a lot of dust to begin with but should a healthy person avoid her residence for an extended period of time even after she is cured?",
