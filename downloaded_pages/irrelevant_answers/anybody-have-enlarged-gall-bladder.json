            "answer": "Interesting, never heard of an enlarged gallbladder, just gallstones and cholestasis. You're not confusing the gallbladder with the spleen? And yes I strongly believe that a long term HCV infection can cause gallbladder problems, amongst other things. Studies have tied HCV to gallstone formation, insulin resistance and diabetes, just to name a few. I myself was diagnosed with gallstones when I was only 31 (infected at 17), and they were fully formed so I had probably had them for years prior to that (no family history at all for them either). They caused me quite a bit of pain for awhile, they can be very painful for some people. They didn't find any stones or see one blocking your cystic duct? Did the pain come on after a meal, especially one with grease/fat in it? A fat laden meal can trigger gallbladder attacks.Anyway, let us know what comes of it when you learn more, I'd be interested in hearing what you find out about this. Hope you get it straightened out in the meantime, good luck.",
