            "answer": "Congratulations on your lifestyle change and also ridding yourself of your hypertension and\u00a0\u00a0pre-diabetes conditions. You should be proud of yourself and feeling a lot healthier too. Maintaining a good diet along with moderate exercise will keep these conditions under the radar. Keep it up!As far as insurance companies policies, presently you do not have hypertension nor are you a diabetic. Unless the questionnaire\u00a0\u00a0specifically ask if\u00a0\u00a0\"have you been treated for XXX condition in the past\", the honest answer would be yes. However, if the questionnaire asks if you are being \"presently treated and/or under the care of a doctor for XXX condition\", the honest answer is no.Insurance companies do not reward you for good behavior, but will either deny you a policy or increase your policy premiums because in their eyes you are an increased risk. Dumb, I know, but that's our health system today and why we need change.If you need to appeal a decision, have your doctor write a letter of commendation explaining your past and present health conditions. Also get copies of your medical test results as an extra bonus.",

            "answer": "I believe you misunderstood goldie's post. No medication was prescribed by the doctor which indicates a pre-diabetic condition. If you are pre-diabetic, that means you have reduced insulin sensitivity but haven't yet been diagnosed with full-blown adult onset type 2 diabetes. In most cases, you can directly reverse this condition and return to a healthy metabolic state by making new choices in your foods and physical exercise. She did this by changing her diet and exercising. Remember, diabetes is a disease that is quite easy to reverse if you catch it early enough. And if you're pre-diabetic, you have an opportunity to reverse the situation right now.",

Goldie, maintain your current lifestyle and prove to those who believe reversing diabetes cannot be obtained.Again, the answer to your question is no, don't consider yourself a diabetic nor hypertensive. \"am I considered \"cured\" (assuming, of course, that I keep my present healthstyle and weight)?\". YES, as long as you maintain a healthy lifestyle.Good luck and good health to you.",

            "answer": "Thanks, guys, for your comments.As for me being pre-diabetic or not, frankly, I don't know. My doctor just said: \"you have Type 2 diabetes, but I'm not giving you any medication, go and start physical exercises and lose some weight\". Now he defined my present blood pressure and lab tests as \"befitting a commando soldier\", and made it very clear that this situation will continue only as long as i keep my present life style (which I definitely intend to do).About the reversibility of diabetes, I was looking at it from the following angle:Unlike, say, HIV - which will stay in the body no matter what you do, type 2 diabetes actually means that the pancreas cannot cope with the amounts of sugar in the blood. Once the body loses weight and the intake of sugars goes down, the pancreas has less pressure upon its system, and the insulin it produces is sufficient for dealing with the requirements of the body.Weight loss and reduced intake of sugars should not be regarded as a sword hanging above the patient's head, ready to drop any moment. It should be regarded more as a change in lifestyle. It is there to stay, and although it requires an effort to keep it that way, one should not regard it as a temporary stage till you get your lab tests sorted out.",

            "answer": "Make no mistake I commend you for your efforts and am glad that you intend to keep them up.\u00a0\u00a0THAT IS GREAT !!!!While you are correct in saying that weight loss and decrease of sugar intake will in fact make it easier for you pancreas to cope with its lack of ability to keep up with your particular body's needs the fact remains that your body is NOT normal and it needs you to maintain these efforts to allow normal sugar levels to be maintained.\u00a0\u00a0If these things are stopped you will revert back to your previous state.\u00a0\u00a0Thus the disease has not GONE AWAY.\u00a0\u00a0It has been controlled effectively without medication.\u00a0\u00a0That does not mean that you no longer have it.Unfortunately the answer to your original question.\u00a0\u00a0Which was \"legally\" do I still have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The answer is YES you do.\u00a0\u00a0You are not cured.\u00a0\u00a0You are properly maintained and healthy.\u00a0\u00a0The medical community is looking into possible cures but one has not been found yet.\u00a0\u00a0There is no debate over that fact in any reliable medical journal.",

            "answer": "\"by Anita Ramsetty, MDHi,I think some of the problem is in terminology and not necessarily the mechanics of the diagnosis. For example, heart disease: once you have that diagnosis, you always have it even after a stent, or even bypass.\u00a0\u00a0Some people think of diabetes this way. I am of the other camp: I do not always label people with diabetes if they now have normal blood sugars when off all medications. That does not fit the diagnostic guideline. What I do say is that there is a HISTORY of diabetes, and this is important to include because even if blood sugars become normal again, you will be at higher risk than normal for going back towards high glucoses in the future.Hope this answers your question.take care. \"",

    "question": "I am a 58-years-old female. A year and a half ago I was diagnosed as type II diabetic (following sugar tolerance test), but no treatment had been started. My doctor told me to start physical exercise and lose as much as possible of my extra weight. I had also been treated at that time for hypertension.A year later (6 months ago) after losing weight and improving my physical condition at the local gym, my blood sugar was back to normal (without any medication) and my hypertension too. All hypertension medication was stopped and subsequent readings were normal.My question is: Am I still considered diabetic and hypertensive? If, for example, I wish to apply for a health insurance policy or a travel insurance policy, should I report these past conditions, or am I considered \"cured\" (assuming, of course, that I keep my present healthstyle and weight)?",
