            "answer": "I don't think stem cell therapy cures everything.\u00a0\u00a0I think at current it treats cancer, parkinsons, spinal cord damage, muscle injuries, and a couple other things.\u00a0\u00a0Also not sure if it would ever \"cure\" or treat autism.\u00a0\u00a0What if your child has a genetic predisposition for autism... wouldn't his stem stells have the same genetic disposition?\u00a0\u00a0I guess you could use one of the siblings/relatives who didn't have autism?\u00a0\u00a0I don't know.\u00a0\u00a0I studied science in college, but I took a lot of physics and geology classes, not biology.Who knows what the doctors will do... medicine has been so incredibly amazing!\u00a0\u00a0I hope they have cures for parkinsons, cancer, diabetes (at least the type I for the poor kids who couldn't help getting it... I have type II but that's my own dumb fault for being overweight).\u00a0\u00a0Anyways, to answer your question... I don't think there is anything at present, but follow the news on it and see if they come up with anything in a few years.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe someone else knows if anything is \"in the gravevine\" with this topic.",

            "answer": "Sorry to be so scatterbrained and responding twice... But I googled Stem Stell Therapy and Autism and found some articles.\u00a0\u00a0Evidently there are some things being researched.\u00a0\u00a0It also seems like there are some things being done currently.\u00a0\u00a0I wonder if this is just something the super wealthy can afford right now.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, I'm very cynical on life and everything.\u00a0\u00a0Sure, if you're Jenny McCarthy you can have the money and the star power to get everything for your child or pay for food carried in if you don't have the energy to cook dinner at night.Oh, right, back to the topic... one of the sites I found...http://www.autismvox.com/another-autism-treatment-stem-cell-therapy/The above link talked stem cell therapy and also cited how one child responded to it.http://www.autismvox.com/another-autism-treatment-stem-cell-therapy/That above link (mentions other diseases treated by stem cell therapy, including diabetes and autoimmune disorders, both of which I have)http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/5/1/30It talks about some of the immune abnormalities and altered inflammatory responses with people with autism and how stem stell therapy might help it.\u00a0\u00a0I think it's strange because I have a lot of asperger traits and also I have an autoimmune disease (the docs keep waffling between lupus and not specified connective tissue disease).\u00a0\u00a0Anyways, that particular article seemed like it addressed treating the things that happen alongside autism, not curing autism itself.There were a lot of other linksAnyways, you can google some things yourself.\u00a0\u00a0I am skeptical about what the average everyday person can honestly afford.\u00a0\u00a0Would I like a cure for my diabetes and lupus/connective tissue disorder?\u00a0\u00a0yes, but do I want to pay $100,000 for it if my insurance won't cover it?\u00a0\u00a0No.\u00a0\u00a0I'd be homeless.\u00a0\u00a0I'd rather have a roof over my head.\u00a0\u00a0Ditto for my daughter.\u00a0\u00a0Clothes on her body, roof over her head, etc. etc.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter has a mild case of PDD and does not have severe autism.\u00a0\u00a0If she had severe autism and couldn't speak and had tons of behavioral issues, maybe I'd consider going into severe debt to help her.\u00a0\u00a0But right now, she has a lot of friends, is very social (though she does have differences in how she socializes and interacts), and is talking a lot more.\u00a0\u00a0Sure, she has ritualistic behavior (OCD like) and sensory issues, but she's working through them with therapy and yes, she'll never totally overcome these things.\u00a0\u00a0I deal with issues I've had since childhood as well (OCD, ADD, and sensory processing issues) but I can hold a job, have a ton of friends, and get through life.\u00a0\u00a0I guess if I figured my daughter couldn't do those things, maybe I'd be more for looking into the stem cell stuff and all those other therapies.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to not having the money, with my autoimmune disorder, I just don't have the energy and would sacrifice being a good mom who plays and interacts with her child.Uh, okay, I went on enough... just well, wanted to share... I'm in a bit of a funk right now about a few things and i can't get my brain to focus so well on topic.\u00a0\u00a0:/",
