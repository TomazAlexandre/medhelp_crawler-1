            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The symptoms of tingling and numbness could also be due to anxiety. Contact dermatitis due to coming in touch with dirt, dust, mold, pollen, sun, cold, heat, spoon, glass, food, tooth brush, plastics, toothpaste etc could be another cause.\u00a0\u00a0This is possible as you have it only on face, arms and legs. Low calcium and hypoparathyroidism could be the other causes. Hypothyroidism and diabetes too are the causes. It could also be due to Lyme\u2019s disease.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I was just looking into what the possibilities were of what could be wrong with me. I have been diagnosed and treated for Chronic Lymes disease and for 13 years prior to that, MS. However, according to the infectious disease doctor I have been seeing for Lymes, the recent symptoms I have are not demylination type symptoms (so not MS).My symptoms are that this spring, I had tingling and numbness in the exact same spot on my hands - on the palms - and on the bottoms for both feet.I have been through numerous tests and to several doctors. I am still waiting as patiently as possible and simply want to know what the possibilities are.This discussion is related to/posts/show/203488.",
