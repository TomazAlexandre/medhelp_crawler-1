    "question": "I have had Hashimotos Thyroiditis all my life.\u00a0\u00a0I also have many neurological disorders since I entered my senior years.\u00a0\u00a0The most painful and sleep-depriving is PLMT (Painful Legs Moving Toes Syndrome).\u00a0\u00a0This is a very rare neurological disorder that is relatively unknown and is the cause of many nights of no sleep and a good deal of pain.In addition I have Restless Legs Syndrome and pheriphal neuropathy and now diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Most neurologists do not know nor have they heard of PLMT and there is no known cause or cure.I saw an abstract on the web regarding a connection one neurologist made whereby he attributed the PLMT to his patient's having had Hashimotos Thyroiditis.\u00a0\u00a0Most of the research I have located online is years old.How many of you...if any...have Painful Legs Moving Toes and also Hashimotos?\u00a0\u00a0If any of you do I would be so interested in learning how your neurologist is treating you.Kathy",
