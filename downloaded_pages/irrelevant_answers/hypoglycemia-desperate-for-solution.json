            "answer": "It sounds more like sleep deprivation than diabetes or anything of the sort.\u00a0\u00a0I've dealt with sleeping issues my whole life and have come a long way. I no longer suffer the issues I used to. But nevertheless I have experienced all the effects from insomnia and I know how frightening it can be. Not only is your body tired, cold, confused and weak, but your mind can't focus or think logically either. Everything seems much worse than it is. And this of course leads to anxiety. And the cycle repeats. Not fun, I know.But just knowing what the cause is for your seemingly confusing symptoms can really help to put your mind at ease.There are a few things that I suggest:-Write down what concerns you. Big or small. Get it out of you and on paper. Or talk to someone who can help you sort through what's important and what's not your problem. Take everything day by day.-Exercise. Raising your heart rate biologically tells your system that it has \"outrun its predators\" like we used to do many many years ago, and lets the body know that it is safe to rest. It also gets your endorphines pumping, which keeps you optimistic and happy for hours afterwards.-Eat small but frequent meals to keep your blood sugar levels steady. This is helpful whether you are sleep deprived or not.-Surrender. Once you hit the sheets, know that there is nothing else expected of you. Know that this is YOUR time, and you deserve the rest you need, just like anyone else. You can worry about whatever you want to in the morning.Don't worry. Everything will work out. You'll see.:-)",

            "answer": "Hi there,If you have a history of diabetes in your family it is essential to get a blood test. If you have diabetes you can then be educated on how to deal with and hence cope with the condition. However, you could be suffering from low blood pressure. I too suffer from low blood pressure and it can make u feel tired, weak and nauseous at times. I exercise daily to fire it up so to speak. I would be having a blood test and general check up to diagnose the problem. Good luck!",
