            "answer": "Hello,A complete clinical examination is very important for confirming the exact cause of your symptoms. White patches on tongue can be due to number of conditions like lichen planus, leucoplakia, oral thrush etc.Lichen planus causes raised white lines on your tongue which have a lace-like appearance. In oral thrush there is often cottage cheese-like in consistency on the surfaces of the mouth and tongue. Prolonged uses of antibiotics, asthma, diabetes are all risk factors for having oral thrush.HIV is caused by unprotected sex, blood transfusion or needle stick injuries. You do not have any history suggestive o any so stop worrying. It is best to contact a healthcare professional and get examined. I sincerely hope it helps.Best wishes and regards!",

    "question": "Hello. I'm 19, I had a thin white film and furry on my tongue for several years and it still remains unchanged. It seems like not a coat, just my papillae is white. I can't get rid of it, i can scrape it off but it's still very thin white subsequently. I also have a groove in midline of my tongue and toothmark around the tongue. I have a poor oral dental hygiene history, i used to brush my teeth only 1 time in the morning. It is possibly not related to HIV since I never have sex or use drug before ? I have had it for over 4 years now, if it is HIV, i could be nearly dead right now because i have found that thrush is a sign of the later stage of HIV. Thank you",
