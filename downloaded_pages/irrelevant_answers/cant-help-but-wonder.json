            "answer": "Herr fasting is essential to the test. 10pm to 9am. This will reveal how the sugars are in the body without eating. This is especially important in the three hour as they re test your bloods after the drink to see how your body has reacted. If anything eating would cause a false positive. It's not just sweets etc that has sugar in. White bread..white pasta...yoghurt..fruit etc all have sugar in. Some places you are allowed to eat but it varies everywhere so I would def tell your doc. Hope this helped ,",
