            "answer": "Hi,You need to consult your dermatologist. Since you have been taking antibacterials and antifungals for so long it would be advisable to do a repeat culture and sensitivity of the areas you mention. Discuss with your doctor and get a repeat lab test done to see if there is any persistent bacterial or fungal infection and if so which is the organism involved.The appropriate treatment can then be initiated. Till then try to keep the areas clean and dry. Also try some antiallergic medication so there is no itching.Also get your blood sugar checked to rule out diabetes. This is sometimes a cause of persistent fungal infection.Hope this helps.Good luck.",
