            "answer": "If you do have it, it's absolutely not your fault or anything you did. Very healthy, normal weight women get GB during pregnancy... and many women who are unhealthy and eat a ton of sugar don't get it. Theres just no telling who will and who won't. Don't feel bad or be hard on yourself; it's just a hurdle to jump, and there will be more along the way. You can jump this one. A close friend of mine had it, and she just had to test her blood sugar w/a glucose meter (I had to do that for awhile for something else; it's super easy and doesn't hurt. The latest meters are so cool!) and keep track of her diet, making sure she didn't overdo the sugar. She did gain a bit more weight than average, but nothing that was dangerous or anything. Her baby turned out completely healthy and her GB went away after delivery.Getting rude/unsolicited/insensitive comments from people is one of the worst parts of being pregnant, especially when those comments come from men!! Ugh.... just try to take what people say with a grain of salt. Most of the time people don't know what to say, so they just end up saying something thoughtless instead of keeping their mouths shut like they should. Anyway, hang in there. And here's hoping you don't have GB after all! :)",

    "question": "So i found out today that my levels from the one hour one were only 144.\u00a0\u00a0So i only missed it by 4 freaking points!\u00a0\u00a0So when they started me out after fasting it was only 63.\u00a0\u00a0They drew my blood 3 more times and at the last time she tested and said 158!!!!\u00a0\u00a0Then they tell me not to worry because they have to send it to the lab for the lab people to actually do the results and i still might be ok.I cried the whole entire time home from the doctor, which i then got lectured by my partner, saying that there was no need to be crying since i didnt know the real results yet.\u00a0\u00a0And he goes on to say that he isnt surprised seeing that i eat a lot of carbs and stuff.\u00a0\u00a0Ok keep in mind here i weighed 120 pre pregnancy and im 7 months and only weigh 134!\u00a0\u00a0so im not at all overweight.\u00a0\u00a0Oh and im 5' 7\"!\u00a0\u00a0I was just so bummed out, regardless of knowing the true results.I then come home and start reading all about it, and it says on everything that it doesnt have to do to with diet, its pregnancy hormones that cause gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0So in reality its not my fault.\u00a0\u00a0I cant control my hormones.\u00a0\u00a0Either way i was bummed and i didnt need to hear him say that stuff to me.\u00a0\u00a0Now we are currently not speaking and who knows how long this will go on.Just wanted to vent, so sorry, but your comments are great if you have any advice or just words of encouragement!",
