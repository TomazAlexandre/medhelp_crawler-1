            "answer": "Hi,How are you? I think you are suffering from retrograde ejaculation and not premature ejaculation. Retrograde ejaculation is when semen goes into the bladder rather than out of your penis during orgasm. Although you still reach sexual climax, you may ejaculate very little or no semen (dry orgasm). Retrograde ejaculation isn't harmful, but it can cause fertility problems. It can be caused by medications, health conditions or surgeries that damage the nerves or muscles that control bladder opening.Conditions like high blood pressure, mood disorders, prostrate enlargement, muiltiple sclerosis, diabetes, spinal cord injury, bladder or prostrate surgery can affect ejaculation.Urine analysis with semen analysis can confirm the diagnosis. Treating the underlying conditions can help over come retrograde ejaculation. Consult\u00a0\u00a0a urologist for further assistance.Best.",

            "answer": "We are pretty sure my husband suffers from RE.\u00a0\u00a0About 10 years ago he had the urine and semen analysis done, the final test that would tell us, and the lab lost the results, which they had also done with one of his previous tests so we were very upset and didn't want to pay for an additional test.\u00a0\u00a0He is the only man I have ever been with so I don't know how much semen is a normal amount and when I ask if he did more he says he doesn't know.\u00a0\u00a0We tried over the counter pseudoephedrine but we don't know how many pills he should take or how long before ejaculation he should take them.\u00a0\u00a0I have been looking for info on RE and some sites say that there is a surgery and some say that there isn't. Can anyone help with knowing how to use over the counter decongestants?\u00a0\u00a0I would like to know what the best brand is, how many he should take, and how long he should wait after taking them? He is the only one out of his siblings to not have children yet and we would really like to correct that especially since his father has now passed away and we would like to name our first child after him.\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone please, please help?",
