            "answer": "Go see a doctor and get tested. Frequent urination is one sign of type 2 diabetes. It also could be a sign of a disease you do not feel until more severe such as bladder or urinary tract infection, an enlarged prostrate if male, vaginitis if female, or possibly a tumor. Also comes to mind is from drinking excessive amounts of fluids. Good luck -",

            "answer": "\"It cam 82. It is normal correct?\"Normal fasting ranges are 60/70 to 99 mg/dl.\" Can I rull out high blood sugar i.e. diabetes.?\"Most likely. However, to truly rule out diabetes ask to get an A1c [HA1c,HgbA1c] test. It measures your blood sugars over the past 2-3 months. A fasting test measures only at the time of the test, does not reveal what your blood sugars were 3 hours, the day, or week, or month prior.",

We are patients like yourself who volunteer our time to help others like yourself. If we know the answer we can respond quickly. Other times we have to perform our own research to find the appropriate answer. The last would be time zone differences. Please keep these thoughts in mind.To help answer your question regarding predications on normal to prediabetes and/or prediabetes to diabetes use Google search to educate yourself on diabetes and diabetes prevention. A good place with lots of information is the ADA [American Diabetes Association] web site. Also, MedHelp has an prediabetes forum.
