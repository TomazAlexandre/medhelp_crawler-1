            "answer": "well, you gotta conquer your fears first before you treat your physical condition. there is nothing anyone can do when it comes to diseases, physical problems or health, but \"hospitals, needles & doctors.\" you gotta let go of your fears first. no one dies of depression. it maybe a triggering factor but it doesn't kill you. just let go of your fears & go to the hospital because your condition is something that needs to be taken cared ASAP. but then how do you kill your fears? you know, even happiness is only a state of mind, you can be happy even alone, just thinking of funny stuff. same is true with phobias, its just a state of mind, you can control it. trust me, the doctors will help not hurt. God bless you.",

            "answer": "Phobias, PTSD, and depression are real illnesses.\u00a0\u00a0They are not weaknesses of character or something you can control or even manage without great difficulty.\u00a0\u00a0Are you getting any treatment for your depression?\u00a0\u00a0 Do you have a support system--friends or family members you trust?\u00a0\u00a0Are you getting therapy from a mental health professional and is it helping you move forward?\u00a0\u00a0Ask for a recommendation for a doctor who is known to be particularly kind and compassionate.\u00a0\u00a0Then with the assistance of someone you trust, try to take that first step and call for an appointment.\u00a0\u00a0The first thing the doctor needs to hear from you is an expression of your fears so he/she can proceed is a slow and gentle manner with you.\u00a0\u00a0 Depression, PTSD, and phobias are treatable but will require time and effort before you will see improvement.\u00a0\u00a0That first step is yours, but do enlist the support of a friend.",

I am still having pain in my back, mostly left side flank now.\u00a0\u00a0It hurts to breathe normally. I am going to the doctor as a walk in because I have a husband and 3 sons and God forbid something heart/kidney related is going on and I don't take care of it.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks so much for the replies.\u00a0\u00a0Even though I have family and friends, I don't always tell them everything because I feel they'll attribute it to being \"all in my head\".\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again for caring.",
