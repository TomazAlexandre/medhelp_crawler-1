            "answer": "Hi there, do you mean that when he 'pulls out', the seminal fluid also comes out? If so, it's normal. When he ejaculates, there's nothing to hold the seminal fluid inside you, no place for it to go. Seminal fluid is only used to transport the sperm into the vagina, and avoid the natural barrier of the vagina from killing off the sperm.Seminal fluid isnt what makes you pregnant. The sperm does. Seminal fluid is basically just used to transport and ensure the sperm survive to have any chance of pregnancy.Sorry for your previous loss. However, the cuse of losing a baby does not come down to whether seminal fluid stays in or out. When you lose a baby, it can be many things. Losing a baby can be the cause of an abnormality in the foetus, weakened cervix, medications, placental problems, infections, illnesses in the mother, e.g. diabetes, or high blood pressure, womb structures, etc. There's a lot that can go wrong, but it's not down to the seminal fluid. That did it's job correctly.",

            "answer": "It's normal for sperm to come out - either of you, after intercourse, or his penis during or when he is ejaculating. You have nothing to worry about, and like said above - it's not the cause of a pregnancy loss.",
