            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If it is a deep cut then that will take some days to heal up, need pressure bandage so that the cut edges come close or it may need wound cleaning and stitching. Otherwise there is a chance that you have diabetes which is slowing the wound healing. You need to show this to a doctor. Take care!",

            "answer": "have you tried maybe butterfly bandages (butterfly stitches) they can be bought at longs or walgreens it keeps the cut held together and closed so it will heal thats if its deep you should try it and see how it is after a week. as long as its not infected, red or swollen it may just need time to heal.",
