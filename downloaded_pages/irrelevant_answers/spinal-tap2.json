            "answer": "I'm guessing that your neurosurgeon is concerned about multiple sclerosis (MS), an immune-mediated disease that affects the white matter of the brain. If you are a relatively young woman with neurological signs and symptoms and specific areas of abnormalities on an MRI, then an important diagnosis to consider is MS. If you are older or have stroke risk factors such as high blood pressure and diabetes, then stroke would be a strong consideration. Having said that, just because you have a spot on your MRI does NOT mean you have MS automatically. This requires clinical correlation by your neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0Currently the diagnosis of MS relies heavily though not completely on 3 things: the clinical history and exam, MRI, and spinal tap.\u00a0\u00a0The spinal tap is usually done with special studies to look for immune-mediated breakdown products in the fluid. This can help the physician confirm the diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0As far as a less invasive test, there are a few out there. But their diagnostic value is not as good as that of the spinal tap.\u00a0\u00a0This includes evoked potentials which measure the integrity of your connections within the brain and brainstem and an eye exam if you have had a recurrent history of blurred vision. You should discuss this with your neurologist as she knows your case and has examined you properly.Good luck.",

            "answer": "I dont know if this is helpful or not, jan. I was diagnosed with neurocardiogenic syncope and autonomic dysfunction, with some other difficulties. My doctor also had me have a spinal tap done, because of concerns he had. I thought the spinal tap was going to be horrible, since I had them as a child. However, it wasnt bad at all, this time. I hope that the testing goes well for you. And the spinal tap was able to help them eliminate some diagnosis's that they were concerned about.",

    "question": "Dear Dr.,I am being investigated for another cause of near-syncope, syncope, and dizziness. (I have neurocardiogenic syncope). I have a spot on left side of brain that my neuro has said is a stroke because of rt. sided trouble (numb feel'g, tingling, weird sensations, spasms,etc.) and an EEG showed mild left sided cerebral dysfunction. I went to see a neurosurgeon because of cervical spondylosis and herniated disc. He thinks that neuro shouldn't have jumped on stroke because MRI had a number of differentials. He's recommended she do a spinal tap. My questions are: What can a spinal tap tell them? Do you have any idea what they might be looking for? Is there another test, less invasive, but just as informative?Thank you.",
