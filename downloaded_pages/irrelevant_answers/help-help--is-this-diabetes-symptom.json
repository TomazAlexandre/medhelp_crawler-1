            "answer": "Going to urinate every 4-5 hours is not classed as a urinary problem.Having a urge to go again after you have been can be from the fact that the bladder has not emptied sufficiently.Because you say that you feel anxious and this is when this happens, the urge to go after a few minutes after going is related to your anxiety.Sometimes you may have the urge to go and there will only be a small amount of urine.If you had diabetes, you would have other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Urinating frequently, every 15-30 minutes, as well as other symptoms like extreme thirst, itchy skin.I do sympathise with you, as I am 61 now and I have always had a problem with an urgent need to go soon after when I was very anxious.\u00a0\u00a0For example taking a school test, singing in front of the public as a soloist or anything this is out of the ordinary that makes me anxious.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes worrying that a toilet is not nearby can have the same effect.If you start to urinate frequently, like every 15minutes or every half hour, with a burning sensation, then you would need to be examined by a physican for a possible urinary tract infection.My conclusion is that you are experiencing these urges to go because of your anxiety.Hope that helps to put your mind at rest.",
