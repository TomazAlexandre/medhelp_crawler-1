            "answer": "Darth,What a sad time it is for you now.\u00a0\u00a0I've had diabetes for ~35 years, and can relate to the strain of needing to watch out for ourselves 24*7 -- even on vacations.\u00a0\u00a0There is no vacation from diabetes.While an a1c between 7 & 8 isn't \"the best,\" it's actually not that bad.\u00a0\u00a0We do lower our risks for complications (and can even reverse some) as we lower our a1c into the 6 range.\u00a0\u00a0It's worth trying for as long as we do so without lows.\u00a0\u00a0THAT's really tough to do without pumping.\u00a0\u00a0Even then, it's tough.Sounds as tho' you may feel terrific aobut your endo either.\u00a0\u00a0It's so much easier if we feel comfortable, with all our imperfections right out there, to work with our endos.\u00a0\u00a0If s/he is condescending or just doesn't \"get it\" how tough it is to manage a chronic illnees,\u00a0\u00a0well,IMO it's to shop for another endo.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, we can get \"stuck\" working a doctor cuz that's who we were assigned to ... but there's no reason to stop pushing for a different one.ANother type of person who is very helpful with managing this disease is a CDE -- certified diabetes educator.\u00a0\u00a0They are often not physicians, but are well-schooled in the day-to-day realities of managing food, life, rest, exercise.WHile none of us here is a physician, we've all either \"been there\" where you are -- or are very close to someone who's been there.\u00a0\u00a0The comments included some great perspectives and suggestions and Ihope that some of them resonate with you & help create a better sense of hopefulness. Your diabetes is NOT a lost cause.\u00a0\u00a0If you can make even one step toward improving your situation (I *know* it's tough to do when feeling so discouraged), you'll really be taking a huge step forward on all fronts.Truth is, even in Canada, when a diabetic is looking at ways to feel better and get/stay healthy -- the first place we must look in the mirror.\u00a0\u00a0There's lots of opportunities staring right back at us, if we can muster the courage ....I wish you some new successes and hope you'll post again with an update.All the best,",

            "answer": "Dear Darth Math,Thank you for reaching out to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.I am so sorry that you are experiencing macular edema. Did you see a specialist that explained possible lazer treatments? If your HA1c is running between 7 and 8 you are doing well. One month of bad blood sugars can happen to anyone. Especially if your under stress. On the other hand I agree with christie. You do not want to wait. You may want to check your local hospitals and clinics that can help you without insurance. I don't know where you live, but many have programs that have, can help for\u00a0\u00a0free depending on your income. My son is your age and has a lesser problem with his eyes. A problem all the same. Insurance has always been a major issue with a lot of people. Please don't give up.I would recommend that you contact our Online Diabetes Support Team. This is a personal one on one that connects you with a volunteer that has experienced the same problems. The site is www.jdrf.org/supportteam.christie has the best advice. We ARE responsible for our own health and I know it can be difficult. There are resources out there that can help. Please keep in touch.christie,I thank you very much for your insightful comments.

            "answer": "I am not affiliated with this site; just reading through and can hear how discouraged you are, and as a nurse, just thought I would throw my (probably unwanted) opinion in the mix.Your blood sugars are out of control, you know that better than I.\u00a0\u00a0You are developing a serious complication of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You could be developing other complications, such as kidney disease, but without your endocrinologists evaluation, you don't know. (You may be following up with general doctor, I'm not sure from your post). Your health is nothing to mess around with on your own, in my opinion.\u00a0\u00a0You have been chasing sugars for the past month, with not so good results.I believe saving your sight and your future health is worth $80.\u00a0\u00a0Worth $100.\u00a0\u00a0Worth $1000.\u00a0\u00a0 If you go to the endo and all he does is lecture you, it is YOUR responsibility to have a list of questions prepared as to HOW EXACTLY you are to try to gain better control.\u00a0\u00a0Don't just let him lecture you!\u00a0\u00a0Your health will determine whether or not you work in the future, after all.\u00a0\u00a0 Don't leave his office without a written plan as to EXACTLY how you are to proceed, day by day, week by week, month by month.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors try to rush you out--we all know that.\u00a0\u00a0Sit there, with your list of questions and your notebook where you are going to write down your plan.\u00a0\u00a0Don't get up if he tries to wrap things up and you are not satisfied with what he wants to do.\u00a0\u00a0Sit there, and keep asking questions.\u00a0\u00a0Rehearse at home in front of the mirror, if necessary.\u00a0\u00a0DON'T BE BULLDOZED OUT OF THERE.Bottom line--your health is your responsibility, ultimately.\u00a0\u00a0You can try on your own for a while longer, but eventually you will be back in this same place--possibly with furthur health issues.\u00a0\u00a0Learn to take control now.Dan, you have my very best wishes and a sincere hug is being sent over the internet to you.\u00a0\u00a0I am sorry if this sounds like a lecture--I am concerned and ache for you and your situation.\u00a0\u00a0Keep us informed, ok?Good luck.",

            "answer": "Please don't give up on any benefits of tight glucose control. It is well known that high glucose ranges are the cause of damages to blood vessels, but it is not widely publicized that when you tighten up those glucose ranges to normal values, your body can begin to clear away that bleeding in the eyes (or other organs) if you have not grown excesssive new, weaker vessels. I believe that most opthamolgists will do a follow-up dilation in about three months, and it is possible for your body to work to clear up the bleeding on its own if you remove the source of the problem (high glucose in the blood vessels). I have been a type 1 for 34 years and, after one three-month period where I had suffered from higher glucose than my usual tight control due to a horrible bout of flu that had me sick for two months, my eye doctor spotted a couple of tiny blood specks. With the glucose back to normal tight levels, those specks vanished completely in three months. While it seems that you have something more serious than a few specks, you didn't mention whether you are generating new blood vessels to compensate for the hemorraging. If not, then that blood can be carried off in a few months if you lower the glucose ranges. So I would not only beg you to see your doctor, but take every possible step to get the glucose under control now and keep it that way. That was good advice about pestering your doctor about specific things you can do to make your control better. We each need to find the system that works for us, personally.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you the best.",

I guess some enlargement of the nerve isn't uncommon among the near sighted. I dunno what the other lady saw but apparently it either didn't exist or went away with a month of low sugars.",
