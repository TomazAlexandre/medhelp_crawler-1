            "answer": "I am not sure why the doctor ordered Total T4, instead of Free T4.\u00a0\u00a0Only the T4 not bound to protein, thus called \"free\" is biologically active.\u00a0\u00a0You should make sure they always test for Free T4 along with the Free T3, each time you go in for tests.\u00a0\u00a0The T3 uptake test is outdated and not very useful.\u00a0\u00a0The TPO ab test was negative, but the TG ab test shows positive, so that indicates Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.So far your available test results are not indicating a severe hypo condition.\u00a0\u00a0This could be due to being in the early stages of Hashimoto's, but that doesn't explain your symptoms, in view of those serum test results.So this leads to another possibility.\u00a0\u00a0Serum thyroid hormone levels do not always accurately reflect what is more important, which is tissue thyroid hormone levels.\u00a0\u00a0Serum thyroid has to be transported into cells in order to be metabolized, as needed by the body.\u00a0\u00a0Researchers have concluded that the \"biological effects of thyroid hormones at the peripheral tissues- and not TSH concentrations- reflect the clinical severity of hypothyroidism and the lack of euthyroidism\".\u00a0\u00a0The transport function can be affected by many variables, as noted in the following quote.\" It is important to note that because this transport of thyroid hormones into the cell is energy dependent, any condition associated with reduced production of the cellular energy (mitochondrial dysfunction) will also be associated with reduced transport of thyroid into the cell, resulting in cellular hypothyroidism despite having standard blood tests in the \u201cnormal\u201d range. Conditions associated with reduced mitochondrial function and impaired thyroid transport include: insulin resistance, diabetes and obesity (68,69,70,71,106); chronic and acute dieting (4,51,66,72,112,113,114,115,116,117,118); diabetes (69,73,74,75,76); depression (73,77,78,79); anxiety (73,80); bipolar depression (73,77,81,82); neurodegenerative diseases (73,83,84,85,86,87); aging (73,74,88-100); chronic fatigue syndrome (73,101,102); fibromyalgia (73,103,104); migraines (73); chronic infections (73); physiologic stress and anxiety (73,79); cardiovascular disease (73,99,104,105,108); inflammation and chronic illness (73,109,110,111); and those with high cholesterol and triglyceride levels (58,60,72,106,107). Thus, standard blood tests can be very unreliable if any of these commonly occurring conditions are present (1-107).You have at least a couple of conditions listed:\u00a0\u00a0high cholesterol and high triglycerides, both of which can also be caused by hypothyroidism.In order to assess the possibility of low tissue thyroid levels, the best test is a Reverse T3 test, along with a Free T3 test taken from the same blood draw, in order to calculate a Free T3 to Reverse T3 ratio.\u00a0\u00a0 Along with that I would recommend testing for cortisol, and ferritin.\u00a0\u00a0You can read about the need for those tests in the following link.\u00a0\u00a0I highly recommend reading at least the first two pages, and further, if you want to understand the reasons behind the 6 suggestions on p. 2.\u00a0\u00a0 Since fatigue is one of your symptoms I would add a test for B12 also.http://www.thyroiduk.org.uk/tuk/TUK_PDFs/diagnosis_and_treatment_of_hypothyroidism_issue_1.pdfI highly recommend doing the additional tests.\u00a0\u00a0I also recommend talking to your doctor to find out if he is willing to treat a hypothyroid patient clinically, by testing and adjusting Free T4 and Free T3 as needed to relieve symptoms, without being constrained by resultant TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0Symptom relief should be all important, not just test results.\u00a0\u00a0Also ask if he is willing to prescribe T3 type meds like Armour Thyroid and Cytomel.\u00a0\u00a0If either answer is no then you are going to need to find a doctor that will do so.Before considering thyroid hormone medication I think you need to get the additional tests done.\u00a0\u00a0 That will enable a better idea of what needs to be done at present.",

            "answer": "B12 should be in the upper end of its range.\u00a0\u00a0What was your level?You don't necessarily need an Endo.\u00a0\u00a0Many of them specialize in diabetes, not thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Also many of them have the \"Immaculate TSH Belief' and think that TSH tells them all them need to know to diagnose and treat a hypothyroid patient.\u00a0\u00a0That is very wrong.\u00a0\u00a0Also, if they test beyond TSH, it is usually only Free T4 and then they use \"Reference Range Endocrinology\", by which they will tell you that a Free T4 test that falls anywhere within the range is adequate.\u00a0\u00a0That is also wrong.\u00a0\u00a0A good thyroid doctor will treat clinically, as described above.\u00a0\u00a0If you will tell us your location, perhaps we can suggest a doctor that has been recommended by other thyroid patients.As I suggested I think you will need to be on thyroid med, based on symptoms and test results, but you need to get the recommended tests done to confirm, and also supplement as needed to optimize Vitamin D (should be 50 min.), B12 in the upper end of the range, and ferritin should be 70-100.",
