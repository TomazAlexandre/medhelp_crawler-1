In pancreatitis, the enzymes become activated while still in the pancreas. This causes the enzymes to irritate the cells of your pancreas, causing inflammation and the signs and symptoms associated with pancreatitis.With repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis, damage to the pancreas can occur and lead to chronic pancreatitis. Scar tissue may form in the pancreas, causing loss of function. A poorly functioning pancreas can cause digestion problems and diabetes.Pancreatitis has many causesA number of causes have been identified for acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis, including:AlcoholismGallstonesAbdominal surgeryCertain medicationsCigarette smokingCystic fibrosisEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), when used to treat gallstonesFamily history of pancreatitisHigh calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemia)High levels of parathyroid hormone in the blood (hyperparathyroidism)High triglyceride levels in the blood (hypertriglyceridemia)InfectionInjury to the abdomenPancreatic cancer\"For me it was gallstones.Get yourself a good Gastro Doc and hopefully you can get it figured out.",
