            "answer": "How was your husband diagnosed with HSV2? What were the exact results of the blood or swab test?If one of you has it, then it is possible not to transmit it to a partner, even after 23 years of sexual intercourse.For a genital HSV2 infection, then the only realistic chance of infection is through sexual intercourse and taking a little extra care not to touch genital lesions if they are present.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your help.\u00a0\u00a0My husband had a blood test done for anything because he knew something was wrong with him. He found out he had diabetes and HSV1 and HSV2. I got my test results back and it is negative. So it is okay to continue being together and is it possible that we may never have an outbreak? That after 23 years it is possible to have sex and not get it?",

    "question": "My husband of 23 years has tested positive for HSV-2. I am 43 but really uneducated in this area. I have grandchildren that have spent the night and have drank and eaten off my plate. I am scared to death that I may have given it to them. I am not quite sure how all this works. If it is an STD,the only way to contract it, is by having intercourse with someone who has it, Is this the only way you can pass it on. Oral or Vaginal. I was tested last week and still haven't got the results back. Neither of us have had any lesions or outbreaks that we are aware of. If my husband has it then I must too. I just don't want to accidentally pass it to someone else because I am not sure exactly how it is spread. Can you please enlighten me on just how it can spread.I have read the fact sheets on the CDC website. It didn't answer my specific questions.",
