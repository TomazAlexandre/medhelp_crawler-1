            "answer": "I would try taking a hot bath and if they stay consistent and don't go away after that then just go to l&d and see what they say. It doesn't hurt to get checked out and the worst they can do is just send you home but you never know if the contractions are strong, consistent and causing you to dilate they may just decide to keep you.! Good luck. :)",

Take 2 extra strength Tylenols thatll make u more comfortable at least. Just remember if they get to be too much go in and get checked. I see my dr on Tuesday so we'll see how it goes",
