            "answer": "Well I can tell you I work in the health field and have also had my gall-bladder removed and having almost same\u00a0\u00a0problems. I have suffered from diarrhea violently and then it turns to irritable constipation. I have gained weight since gall-bladder was removed and have not changed eating patterns or exercise. My advice is the advice everyone else is giving me. Go see a gastrointestinal doctor and explain all of your problems and tell him or her when they began and the severity of your symptoms. Do not mess around with doctors who are not qualified in that area. Now I will also take\u00a0\u00a0mt own advice and go as well. Good luck",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You have to fins the cause of chronic diarrhea. Once that stops, all other symptoms will automatically subside.Chronic diarrhea can be due to parasitic infestations.\u00a0\u00a0Other causes are irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, Crohn\u2019s disease, malabsorption syndromes, pancreatic diseases, diabetes, hyperthyroidism etc. If celiac, Crohn\u2019s and other problems have been ruled out then lactose intolerance and IBS are the possibilities. Gas in stomach, burping, diarrhea all go in favor of IBS. Pancreatic enzyme disorders, liver dysfunction, HIV, cancer of the gut, and infections by parasites other than giardia can all cause persisting diarrhea. Lyme and lupus are other possibilities that present this way. Please discuss this with your doctor (GI doctor).Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
