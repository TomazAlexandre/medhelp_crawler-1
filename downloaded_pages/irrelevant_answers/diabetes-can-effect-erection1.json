            "answer": "Yes to diabetes type II. (Nohard has me questioning type I now, I'm unsure about that, but since you're over 20 I'm going to assume type II.)I believe it's because of something to do with blood flow. Remember diabetes uncontrolled effects more than just the sugar in your blood. You can severely damage your kidneys, liver, and pancreas (just to name a few) if you aren't taking care of diabetes. Some of the symptoms (of type II) do include frequent urination, vaginal yeast infection (women), oral thrush, fatigue, excessive thirst, rapid weight loss, and difficulty maintaining an erection. If you think you may have diabetes I suggest talking to your dr asap, because I've seen just how nasty uncontrolled diabetes can be on the body.",

            "answer": "Ok type 2, this if I'm right you can control just by diet along with doing your sugar tests daily, and here something to read.How diabetes affects normal sexual functionIn male individuals with diabetes, normal sexual function may be disrupted for a number of reasons related to nerve and blood vessel damage.Diabetes can cause damage to nerves (neuropathy) throughout the body, including the penis. Damaged nerves can't communicate properly. So even though a man might be emotionally stimulated to have sexual intercourse, nerve damage means that the relevant information isn't relayed to the penis, so it doesn't respond.In addition, poor blood sugar control, a key symptom of diabetes, can inhibit nitric oxide production. Lack of nitric oxide can prevent the pressure of blood in the corpora cavernosa from rising enough to close off penile veins, allowing blood to flow out of the penis instead of remaining trapped for an erection. Blood vessels can also become narrowed or hardened (atherosclerosis) by conditions that often accompany diabetes, such as Cardiovascular Disease. When atherosclerosis occurs in arteries that supply the penis or pelvic area, sexual function may be disrupted.How to fight back against EDErectile Dysfunction doesn't have to last forever. There are steps that can help prevent ED from occurring or worsening.\u2022Control your blood sugar by increasing insulin sensitivity via more effective management of your diabetes. Good blood sugar control can prevent the nerve and blood vessel damage that may lead to ED.\u2022Talk to your doctor. Initially, it can be embarrassing to talk to a doctor about sexual health. But because erectile dysfunction is a common diabetes-related problem, your doctor won't be surprised when you mention the topic. Talking to your doctor before a problem occurs can help you prevent or delay erectile dysfunction. Your doctor can also help determine if ED is the result of diabetes or another condition.\u2022Avoid tobacco. Smoking and other tobacco use cause blood vessels to narrow, contributing to blockages that can lead to erectile dysfunction. Smoking also can decrease nitric oxide levels.\u2022Avoid excessive alcohol. Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can cause ED by damaging blood vessels. In general, for men that means no more than two alcoholic drinks a day. For women, it should be no more than one.\u2022See a urologist. Urologists have special expertise in sexual health. Some specialize specifically in erectile dysfunction. They can help assess your condition and determine its cause.\u2022Seek mental/emotional health treatment. Stress, anxiety and depression can cause erectile dysfunction. Even the fear of having erectile problems can make them worse. Talk to your doctor to see if these issues are playing a role in your ED. Treatment with a mental health professional might help.\u2022Reduce your risk of Cardiovascular Disease. Men with diabetes who also have Metabolic Syndrome (Syndrome X), the cluster of increased risks for Cardiovascular Disease such as obesity and high blood pressure, face an even greater likelihood of developing ED. This is because of the added damage to blood vessels caused by Metabolic Syndrome. The risk of developing Metabolic Syndrome can be reversed by losing excess weight via a balanced, nutritious diet and regular exercise.Taking the right steps to control existing conditions like diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome can play a vital role in reversing ED and allowing men to enjoy a healthy sex life again.The Insulite Diabetes Advanced Management System is a scientific breakthrough that could improve your health by increasing the insulin sensitivity of your cells. Greater sensitivity can result in a huge improvement in the efficient processing of glucose and insulin, thereby reducing the amount of insulin you require to manage your diabetes.By lowering your insulin intake and dependency through more effective management, you are likely to experience better long-term heath and a greater sense of long-term well being. You can also reduce your risk as a person with diabetes of developing such serious insulin-linked complications as failing eyesight, kidney disease and heart disease and the need for amputation.Hope this has helped you",

            "answer": "Wow, incredibly informative nohard!I do have to say though if your diabetes is way out of control it sometimes cannot immediately be controlled with just diet. Most cases that I've known and seen (tons of family with diabetes) diet is the main way to keep it in check, but sometimes it's not enough. When my grandma was going through chemo- diet wasn't enough to control her diabetes, she needed a prescription. However this is an extreme thing to do to your body and she was soon able to control it herself. Also it IS possible to almost completely reverse diabetes if you get yourself to a healthy weight and lifestyle. So never believe you have to be stuck with diabetes. Most of my family have basically given up but this is silly- no matter where you are in diabetes you have the power to stop it and fight. Don't forget that.",
