            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Chronic diarrhea can be due to parasitic infestations.\u00a0\u00a0Other causes are irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, crohn\u2019s disease, malabsorption syndromes, pancreatic diseases, diabetes, hyperthyroidism etc. Since you have had the problem for last four years you have lost weight too. If celiac, Crohn\u2019s and other problems have been ruled out then lactose intolerance and IBS are the possibilities. Gas in stomach, burping, diarrhea all go in favor of IBS. Pancreatic enzyme disorders, liver dysfunction, HIV, cancer of the gut, and infections by parasites other than giardia can all cause persisting diarrhea. Please get the stool examined and consult a gastroenterologist.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "My sister used to have all sorts of digestive problems and I suggested she start drinking soy milk or another milk substitute.\u00a0\u00a0It really helped so maybe you are lactose intolerant.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like you have other medical issues (but really who doesn't?) but switching from milk products to almond milk, soy milk or lactose free milk might help.\u00a0\u00a0What kind of rash do you get on your face?\u00a0\u00a0My skin used to get a little red if I didn't take my vitamins but it always goes away when I do.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I have a vitamin deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0Do you take a multi vitamin?",
