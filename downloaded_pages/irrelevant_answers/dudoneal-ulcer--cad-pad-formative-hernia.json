            "answer": "EECP is an effective way to stimulate the 'lazy' collateral vessels to be more productive in oxygenating deprived muscle. It's an external heart and circulatory assistant that helps the body heal itself. Pain with exertion is the muscle's way of saying, \"I need more air\". EECP is non-invasive and unlike bypass surgery, there is no chance of infection and graft rejection.Diabetics are more prone to infection simply because bacteria loves excess sugar in the blood. Moreover, higher blood sugars create sticky glycoproteins that easily clog up vessels. Especially the micro-vessles in the retina.You are fortunate to not have experienced angina. Cardiologists must outweigh the risk:benefit ratio for each patient as an individual. I think starting with the least invasive procedure is good advice, considering you are asymptomatic at this time.It seems as though the cardiologist would like to see you better manage your diabetes through diet and exercise. Quitting smoking is a very important step to improve your current health and prevent further damage.\u00a0\u00a0Surgeons are very leary to provide expensive and aggressive interventions when patients are unwilling to do their part.Educating yourself about your conditions is a great leap in the right direction. We often don`t do the right things because we don`t know what the right thing looks like. I strongly encourage you to attempt smoking cessation as you will notice immediate improvements in your breathing and circulation. It may be a good idea to talk to others on these forums who quit due to health reasons. It can be done and YOU CAN DO IT ;o)Well wishes to you!RNangel",

    "question": "I have 90% Right Coronary Artery Blockage, 50% Left Heart Artery Blockage. Left groin 100% PAD with healthy Collatarel Arteries. 60% Right leg Stenoises. NO ANGINA PAIN/NO HEART ATTACK OR FAILURE but walking fast or slow beyond 200-500 yard cause very severe left groin pain. I was admitted to hospital on 3rd Oct 2011 after a doppler where angiogram showed in the diagram 99% RA Blockage and 70 % LA Blockage and was prepared for Operation when a huge cyst was removed from left hip. Operation of 4 graft bypass postponed for 6 weeks when I was readmitted on Nov 26 2011 and discharged after 5 hours when I told them that my blood group is B(NEGATIVE). Took opinion of three top cardiologists who told me OMT would work and bypass was not required. Took 4th Opinion who told me the same thing but advised me to get\u00a0\u00a0enrolled for EECP Therapy and Heart well being program(50% LA, 60-70% LA, Less than 50% LA BLOCK as per 4 cardiologists except first one). The cardiologist advised me that Grafting surgery is very problematic and overly expensive. EECP was required with Life style changes. Please advise what's best as B(negative) blood group being very rare alongwith diabetes could be very hazardous and also told me me that EECP would reverse PAD blocks as well. Help sought.Note: Been smoking 2 packs and more since 1970 and am running my 60th year.ECHO: 60%",
