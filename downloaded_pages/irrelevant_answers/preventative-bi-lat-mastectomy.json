            "answer": "Thank you Dr. Johnson for responding to my question.To my knowledge, there is no family history of breast cancer.\u00a0\u00a0My breast history began with my 1st biopsy ( neg ) of the left breast in 1999.\u00a0\u00a0I have dense breasts.\u00a0\u00a0Since then, I've had magnified view mammograms, scinti-mammograms, and last year a BSGI ... all due to calcifications.One of my reasons for considering the bi-lat mastectomy is the fact that mentally and emotionally I'm ready and accepting of the diagnosis of the left breast and in actuality do not want to go through the months of biopsies and lumpectomies of the right breast.\u00a0\u00a0My surgeon would like to follow the right breast with a diagnostic mammogram in 6 months.The second reason I have been considering having the right breast removed is due to a strong family history of adult-onset diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Both my mother and maternal grandmother were insulin dependent and the rest of my family are treating their diabetes with medication.\u00a0\u00a0My brother and I are the only two that have not been diagnosed with DM to date.I have worked in a family practice office for the past 15 yrs., and I know the secondary effects of diabetes such as cardiovascular, renal and circulatory disease.Currently I am being treated for hypertension and hyperlipidemia ... and I know the state of my health right now ... I don't know what my health condition would be in the furture.I appreciate your comments,\u00a0\u00a0thank you.Donna",

    "question": "After various diagnostice tests (mammorgram, MRI w/contrast, needle guided bx) and most recently, lumpectomy, I have been diagnosed with DCIS - multi focal (wide spread) - grade 0 - with A-typ and hyperplasia in my Left breast.\u00a0\u00a0I also am + for receptors and use of Tamoxifin.\u00a0\u00a0I am currently scheduling a mastectomy and reconstruction of my left breast.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My question:\u00a0\u00a0the\u00a0\u00a0Right breast has indeterminate calcifications (this is how the affected breast started), and although my breast surgeon and oncologist seem to think I should just follow the right breast closely, my gut tells me to have the right breast removed as well (my GYN agrees with me) - still waiting the opinion of the Plastic Surgeon.",
