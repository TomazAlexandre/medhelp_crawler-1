I have muscular dystonia, which is a sister disease for parkinson's disease. I have sometimes also some general muscle weakness, eg. it is difficult to sit or carry water buckets.",

            "answer": "Hello,Apart from parkinsonism, it can be due to obstruction due to enlarged prostate due to benign prostatic hypertrophy (often called BPH) or infection of the prostate( prostatitis), any blockage in the flow of urine like any scar tissue, injury (as in a car wreck or bad fall), blood clots, infection, tumors in the pelvic region, and stones, infection or due to disruption of the delicate and complex system of nerves that connects the urinary tract with the brain and the nervous system.I suggest you an immediate urologist\u2019s evaluation to check out these possibilities and confirm the diagnosis after investigations.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "My diabetes insipidus is controversial. One doctor says that I have central diabetes insipidus and others, eg. the latest urologist, say that I do not have it.Because doctors did not search the cause years ago, I think that it is not important. The condition has been intermittent for many years and thus may not be serious.I have had only a couple of bladder infections during my 65-year life, thus infections may not be causes for it. I have uterine issues, myomas and endometrial overgrowth. They are under half-yearly following. I have hypercalcemia but no symptoms of renal stones. I have no pain in my bladder or urethra. Possibly the problem is in the nerves. I have cervical muscle dystonia and my left hand has some shortage of fine motoric function. I have often sitting difficulties possibly due to neuromuscular dysfunction. Maybe the fundamental cause is in my metabolic disorders: hypothyroidism (although under medication), hyperparathyroidism, mild diabetes insipidus (?), electrolyte imbalances. And why not parkinson-like condition in the brain?I have told about the bladder weakness to many doctors, but they do not want to the clear up the cause. They only say that cathetrization can ultimately be used.",

    "question": "What causes voiding difficulty, weak bladder? It was years ago, when I had urodynamic and cystoscopy studies. A weak bladder was found and no other urological disease. I was then about 60 y. No causes for the weak bladder were studied. The detrusor muscle tone varies vith time.I have sometimes polyuria and nocturia (and high serum sodium and osmolality).",
