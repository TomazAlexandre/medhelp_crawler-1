            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Left shoulder pain can be due to gas built up by chronic constipation. However, the possibility of a heart issue cannot be ruled out completely. Hence consult a doctor for a 12 lead EKG.Chronic constipation can be due to diet poor in roughage or fiber, dehydration, diabetes, hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc. It can also be due to milk allergy and other food allergies. Please consult a gastroenterologist to find the cause.Take care!",
