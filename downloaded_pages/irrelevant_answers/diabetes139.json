You will be for life. You can control what you eat and the amount of exercise you get in order to get your blood glucose levels under control. You can delay or avoid the complications of this disease. But you will never not be diabetic. You need to educate yourself on this disease. Go to the website of the American Diabetes Association; they have lots of information and you need it.",
