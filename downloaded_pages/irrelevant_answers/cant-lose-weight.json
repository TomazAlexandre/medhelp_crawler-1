            "answer": "Recommend having a full check-up with blood work including your thyroid levels. If the thyroid levels are normal, then use a tape measure instead of a scale to indicate if you are advancing in getting healthy with your exercising and eating healthy. Measure your waist and hips as a guide for trimming down. As we exercise we build lean body muscle mass which weight more than fat so the scale reflects no weight loss when in fact the body is trimming down fat. The tape measure will measure loss of inches and your clothes will start to feel looser. Hope this helped you.",

            "answer": "the depo is the culprit along with the prozac...most birth control methods have synthentic estrogen, estrogen keeps pounds on...then adding prozac, is another weight gainer.I was on synthetic estrogen, b/c pill, in my 20's, weighing 198lbs throughout 20's, oh, you are depressed, here is zoloft...more weight gain...sugar imbalance. hormone imbalance was the main issue not discovered until total hysterectomy.\u00a0\u00a0I then used more synthetic hrt and gained more weight...I stopped synthetic hrt, starting using natural hormones (which might be issue since I couldn't have kids and you r trying to protect yourself from getting pregnant) but when I stopped hrt and balanced out hormones with progesterone (natural and some other hormones excluding estrogen) lost 30lbs..I failed to mention\u00a0\u00a0I had already been exercsing 20 yrs, 2 hours a day, eating right and still no weight loss then.\u00a0\u00a0However, I was able to stop diabetes meds as I eat 5 times a day, no sugar imbalances, no hormone imbalances, exercise still and I now weigh 120 lbs since 2003....you are eating too little calories and probably not enough protein...sorry so long, I do have my own site to see for yourself and read as much as you can and do your research which is why I am now a nutritionist and natural hormone clinician...that is why women struggle to lose weight more than men....blessings to you my new friend.Connie Allen, CNC messengerofhealth.com",

    "question": "I am a 42 yr old female who can't seem to lose weight. I have recently started Tricor for high triglyceride levels (1200). I have been eating healthy, lots of veggies, and limiting my calories to about 1200 per day. I do a weight loss routine on my treadmill for 30 minutes per day burning @200 calories at least 4-5 times per week. I weigh 173 pounds, which is up 3 pounds from when I started. My PCP felt my Prozac, which I take for chronis pain, may be the culprit, but I was weaned off of it about 3 weeks ago. The only other meds I take are flexeril for nighttime pain, a multivitamin, and DepoProvera every 3 months for birth control. I don't know what else to do.",
