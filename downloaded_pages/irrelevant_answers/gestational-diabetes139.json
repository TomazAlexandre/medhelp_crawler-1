            "answer": "Don't worry too much. I failed my 2 hr. I just have to check my blood sugar 4 times a day. You just need to watch your carbs. My blood sugar is suppose to be under 130 after an hour it's somewhere around 110-120 so its not big deal. I failed my test by 4 pts. It doesn't mean anything bad as long as you keep it in check. If your sugars are way too high it can cause a big baby and can cause you to be more likely to have diabetes later in life. People usually get induced early if they haven't kept it under control and baby is getting big.",

            "answer": "But a lot of women fail their first test then pass the 3 hour one. I didn't even get a 3 hour one. I got a 2 hr one so idk if I would've passed it after another hr like most doctors do. Just make sure the day before to eat really well like no carbs. And then when you drink the drink for the test walk around the building outside burn off some of those sugars. I probably would've passed but I just sat there.",

    "question": "I'm 27 weeks went to get my sugar test done it came back 145 so now I have to go back and take the 3hour test. I'm wondering if there are any moms that have had this and what happened? How did they treat you? Were you induced early? How is the baby? I don't know what to expect I'm hoping I don't have it but idk. Just need some insight thanks in advance.",
