            "answer": "Don't be overly concerned. Your EKG has a segment called the ST segment. When there is some death of tissue the ST segment is elevated (but sometimes depressed). This is an electrical event and abnormality. Bear in mind that one can have a heart that is perfectly still (as in dead) and have a normal EKG (electromechanical disassociation). There is a strong liklihood that a tiny portion of the tissue on the heart has become necrotic. This is the most common reason for an ST abnormality. It may be a very small portion of tissue. People go on and live for a very long time with this problem. Follow the instructions of your cardiologist. The ablation procedure alone can cause damage resulting in an ST abnormality. I'm not saying it did, but it could.\u00a0\u00a0Aspirin is not a blood thinner. Chances are the second EKG will have the same result. You will probably have a very long life ahead.",

            "answer": "I'm assuming your diabetes testing results are after a fast.\u00a0\u00a0If so, they are still pretty high.If you just have had a cardiac ablation, I think a goofy ecg would be expected as the electrical pathway is changed.\u00a0\u00a0I would pay more attention by far to the stress test evaluation.",

            "answer": "Appreciate your answers...I am going for 2nd EKG, if that comes out same, i will prepare for stress test and go see a cardiologist in next 2-3 weeks. I have been feeling just fine so I hope there is nothing wrong. Once I get into normal life I will train myself to go through stress test ASAP.I though aspirins are to thin the blood !Anyway, I will post here my progress... thanks",

    "question": "I am totally freaked out ! I have a diabetes which was diagnosed 4 months ago and now stays around 130 - 140... its coming down fast since I eat lot of vegetables and watching my diet. I just had minor surgery (thermal ablation) and today is a second week... it takes about 4 weeks. Anyway, just last week I had a routine physical check up and Cholestorel came 212, TG 160 and EKG shows I had a silent attack which could be recent or 5 years back ! as Dr said. Now I am on a blood thinner (Aspirin) and other pill. Doc said he likes to do stress test but may be 6 week from now since I am recovering from current surgery !I am very worried... I plan to do 2nd EKG in 2 weeks and then if that comes different, I will be relieved. I will get stress test done as well. BUT I never had problems on treadmill or any chest pain or anything at all ! I feel great as far as hear is concerned ! I plan to go see a cardiologist as well.Anyone with similar situation, please share your exp. Any help greatly appreciated.This discussion is related to/posts/Heart-Disease/ABNORMAL-EKGS/show/253417.",
