            "answer": "Can you work in a restaurant if you have HIV? Seriously, this is something you need to decide to disclose. Or not. There probably isn't any official policy set in place specifically against Hep C, but I'm pretty sure if you told the hiring manager about it, they wouldn't hire you. Not because they are aware of the risks or know whether it's okay or not....simply because of the stigma. Why risk it?",

You do have to be careful.As for the rest, I respectfully disagree.After nearly 20 years as a chef, I have dealt with all manners of cuts and equipment accidents. I firmly believe I contracted HCV in the 80s following a gruesome accident with floor mixer and a pastry worker. I had none of the other typical risk factors, and got very sick back then. I was diagnosed with \"viremia\" at the time.",
