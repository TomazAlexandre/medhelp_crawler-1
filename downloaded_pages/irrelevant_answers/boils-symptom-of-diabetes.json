            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.. If you have no history of elevated blood glucose, it is unlikely diabetes is the cause of your boil. It is more likely just a small area of skin infection caused maybe by an ingrown hair or clogged pore. I would recommend cleansing the area with mild soap and water. You could apply a topical antiseptic such as neosporin. If the infection does not clear up, or you notice increased redness, swelling, or pain at the site, have your doctor take a look at it.I hope this helpsCathy",

    "question": "I had a glucose test 3 weeks ago and it was in the normal range, never had a history of high levels.\u00a0\u00a0I woke up this morning with a boil on my inner thigh and my sister said it could be a symptom of diabetes. I also had a cbc that was normal. Is she correct? Could I go from normal glucose level to diabetic level so quickly? I am a bit nervous now.Thanks in advance!",
