    "question": "Hi, I have been a heavy binge beer drinker and a smoker for 2 years. Six months back, I had done some tests after feeling some pain in the right side of the abdomen. My stomach used to feel like it's burning inside. It was a very vague feeling. I had done LFT, ULTRASOUND, lipid profile and some other diabetes and hepatitis tests after consulting a gastroenterologist. Doctor told me that my cholesterol levels are very elevated in 365's and my SGPT & SGOT were also in the range of 360's. He told me after looking at my ultrasound that I have mild fatty liver as it was slightly enlarged. The doctor didn't find any diabetes or hepatitis. He clearly told me to stop drinking and get back to physical activities. Now, after six months after not taking any medicines to improve it, I stopped drinking/smoking completely, I started playing badminton daily and went to the lab for LFT & the lipid profile test. The results are below:Lipid profile test results:CHOLESTEROL - 293\u00a0\u00a0HIGHTRIGLYCERIDES - 163 HIGHCHOLESTEROL HDL - 38 LOWDIRECT LDL CHOLESTEROL - 195 HIGHCHOL/HDL ratio - 7.7 HIGHLDL/HDL ratio - 5.1 HIGHVERY LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN - 32.6 HIGHLiver function test results (without GGT):SGOT - 54 HIGHSGPT - 148 HIGHALKALINE PHOSPHATASE - 77LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE - 188BILIRUBIN - 0.50BILIRUBIN, DIRECT 0.10BILIRUBIN, INDIRECT 0.40TOTAL PROTEIN 7.8ALBUMIN 4.5GLOBULIN 3.3ALBUMIN/GLOBULIN RATIO 1.4I'm planning to take Himalaya LIV 52 with Milk thistle to improve my condition. Please suggest what needs to be done more in my case.Thanks in advance Doc!",
