            "answer": "Welcome to the forum; don't worry about your English, we aren't here to judge that, only to help answer your questions.Are you having anything tested, other than TSH, to determine your thyroid status?\u00a0\u00a0You should also be having Free T3 and Free T4 tested.\u00a0\u00a0TSH is a pituitary hormone, which can vary greatly, even throughout a day, while FT3 and FT4 are the actual thyroid hormones and it's important to adjust them adequately to alleviate symptoms.Thyroid levels control body temperature, as well as metabolism.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like you are still hypo, but your doctor is merely changing your med, based on TSH; he will keep you ill for a long time, that way.",

            "answer": "You ask about T4 & T3. : for 3 1/2 yrs,\u00a0\u00a0the test requested is thyro\u00efd profile ( TSH, FT4 if indicated). The T4 is fluctuatingbut always in the normal range (TSH 0.4-4.04) (T4 8.0-18.0).I just find a new endo. after 2 1/2 yrs of a .... doctor. For him, it was my age ,my m\u00e9nopause and I need weight Watches... This new one , I saw 3 weeks ago , increase the syntro\u00efd and will check for maybe Diabete and a abnormal Cortisol.\u00a0\u00a0I had a ultrasound of the thyro\u00efd and the result is : most of the gland is missing because of severe radiation treatment.They do not beleive the \"hypo\" make me take 45 pds.\u00a0\u00a0If I was cheating , o.k. : I did accuponture,, naturel food, severe diet : low in calory & low in glycemic level . and psychiatry therapys and ...... I did not lose 1 pd only increase.\u00a0\u00a0Wath a joy. As you can see, I am Very bitter... It is why I am curious to know if others diseases can have temperature and weight changes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So many\u00a0\u00a0Thank you....to know I am not alone...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Camille",

            "answer": "There are other issues that can cause weight gain/inability to lose - insulin resistance, or Type II diabetes can affect the ability to lose weight, as can adrenal issues.The thyroid controls your metabolism and if it doesn't work right, you won't metabolize your food properly.You said they are testing TSH, \"FT4 if indicated\" - do you h ave an FT4 result?Yes, I can see you are bitter; that's not uncommon for those of us with hypothyroidism, because doctors are so reluctant to test and treat according to what we \"need\", rather than what they learned in med school.\u00a0\u00a0I had a doctor who kept me ill for months because he wouldn't treat me clinically; he only treated by TSH.If you have a Free T4 result, please post it; if not, I strongly recommend that you ask your new endo to begin testing FT3 and FT4, *every* time TSH is tested.\u00a0\u00a0If he's willing to test you for diabetes and abnormal cortisol, he should be willing to test your FT's.",
