            "answer": "Dear Friends,I have very much enjoyed my time on Medhelp and have learned from you even while hosting our Ask-A-Doctor forum for Diabetes. Sadly I am leaving the Medhelp community as my own practice has become busier and time constraints have proved quite challenging. So from April 7th 2008 I will be officially away from Medhelp, but you can still find me at our practice website www.endocrinehelp.com, so please drop me a\u00a0\u00a0line if you wish. Most likely a new physician will be hosting the Diabetes forum for Medhelp in the future, so please continue to check in with the Medhelp community.All the best to you and blessings for the future,Sincerely,Anita Ramsetty,MD",

            "answer": "A second opinion is always reasonable.The overnight dexamethasone suppression test is reassuring to decrease the possibility of cortisol-producing adrenal tumors, a pituitary tumor that produces ACTH, or a tumor in the body that inappropriately produces ACTH. A high-dose overnight test can additionally help distinguish a pituitary cause (Cushing's Disease) from the others.",

    "question": "Hi, I am a 38 year old female who had a serum cortisol that was elevated.\u00a0\u00a0The endo. ordered a 24 hour urine which was slightly elevated , the upper limit was 50 and mine was 53.6.\u00a0\u00a0The endo. then followed with an overnight dexamethasone suppression test and I suppressed.\u00a0\u00a0My pit. MRI only showed prominence with a superior convex border but no signs of tumor or lesion.\u00a0\u00a0This was done on a 1.5T with and without contrast.\u00a0\u00a0I also had an MRI of the abdomen, for an unrelated issue, and the adrenals were fine.\u00a0\u00a0The Endo. did a 24 hour urine 5-HIAA also which was fine.Should this be followed up on?\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned regarding the cortisol elevation.\u00a0\u00a0Oh I am 4'11\" and weigh 125....so maybe a little overweight but ot much.\u00a0\u00a0I am having some mentrual irregularities and some facial hair growth.\u00a0\u00a0All bloodwork for PCOS was neg.I am thinking of getting a second opinion.",
