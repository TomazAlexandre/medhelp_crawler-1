            "answer": "my boyfriend has a burning sensation on his penis after we have sex, so we use condoms even though im on bc. I have hpv but have had no signs/symptoms in 8yrs. what I have read about hpv in men is that burning is not a common syptom. It also says their are no true test for men with hov. Could he be alergic to me or could I have given him hpv",

    "question": "Im visiting an allergist soon, but I have prolonged burning feelings on my legs and sometimes my chest.\u00a0\u00a0All of this began after having sexual relations with a past partner.\u00a0\u00a0I had these feelings for nearly two years and they just went away.\u00a0\u00a0For 5 months it was gone this late 2007, but I recently had sexual relations with a new partner. For the 5 months that it was gone, I ate, drank, and did whatever without thinking since perhaps I have sensitive skin, maybe I shouldn't swim or eat this or drink that.\u00a0\u00a0 STD checks came back negative and I show no visible symptoms.Some people told me to check to see if I have Diabetes or some form of NueroPathy that is affecting my nerves.\u00a0\u00a0The burning is about a 4-5/10 and it varies depending on creams I use.\u00a0\u00a0Just wondering what to make of all this since its something I never had before and it is quite a nuisance to have. Thanks.",
