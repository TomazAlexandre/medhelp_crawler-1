            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!White coat on tongue can be due to food, fungal infection or due to dryness. Repeated acid reflux can also be a cause. If sucking on a hard candy removes it then it must just be old food debris. Fungal infection and acid reflux related white coat will persist.Since it also bleeds, it is most likely fungal infection. A microscopic examination of the scrapings can confirm the diagnosis. Antifungal medications such as tablets, lozenges and liquids will need to be taken for 10-14 days for complete relief.Avoid fuzzy drinks, oily and spicy food and take omeprazole empty stomach in morning and antacid gels 2-3 times a day and see if it helps. At night, raise the head end of bed.Check your diabetes status. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
