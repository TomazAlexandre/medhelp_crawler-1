            "answer": "hey all, about the night time body heat... My wife is 33 pre-diabetic due to poly cystic ovarian disorder and is a convection oven in bed! I could slow cook a roast next to her. Internal body temp stays about 97.1 we walk/hike a lot and her face will turn a very bright red yet she won't sweat much is at all. She experiences anxiety and panic attacks and takes xanax for it. She literally gets so hot at night its impossible to sleep near her. She saw endo and had thyroid checked no probs. I was thinking possibly hypothalamus as she has other symptoms that sound right but i cant talk her into seeing a doc about it. We have a 6 yr old child and both of us would like her around in 10 yrs. Many in her family have died young due to cancer, diabetes etc. Any ideas on what might cause these symptoms and how i can talk her into seeing her doctor??? Thanks!",

    "question": "I have experienced excessive body heat for years, and cannot get an answer as to why. I do have various medical problems, but these did not start until well after the body heat issue. Until just a few years ago, I did not notice this problem- I only knew of it because of comments by my (ex) husband, and my kids- anytime they slept with me they would complain that I was so hot they couldn't stand to touch me or lie next to me. Recently, the excessive heat has become very obvious to me. I do not sweat, and won't have a fever, but feel like I am burning up and feel like the clothes I am wearing are made of plastic holding all the heat in or something.. Have asked my doctors about it and they pretty much just shrug it off.. And I have had my thyroid checked several times, with the tests always coming back as normal. What gives??",
