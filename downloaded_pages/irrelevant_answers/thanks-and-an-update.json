To me, 400 is still off the charts, I've heard horror stories of higher, but 400 is dangerous.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sorry you have to go in insulin, but this can cause you so much more damage than just feeling badly.Not that it changes anything, but I don't think they should of let you out of there w/out getting i down further to a more stable range. Or knowing for sure what has caused this to happen so suddenly.\u00a0\u00a0Was the med you mention controlling it well until this?ttys,Shell",

I realllllly hope all your doctor's get their ducks in a row, you don't usually just 'develop' that kind of awful high levels in two or three weeks, not if they are sustaining like that.

The nurse (being sent through my PCP) will be here around 10 in the am. My DH picked up the insulin and syringes, etc so all is ready for her visit. i guess she'll be coming out for a week or so to get me going.I just don't understand why they discharged me when my sugar was not at all under control. Yes I know, I am not the ideal inpatient - I HATE hospitals. But it just seems poor judgement to discharge someone w/ those levels and tell them \"oh, they'll keep going down\" - not quite!Z - you are right - I think I have no body systems left to malfunction! Hoping the insulin is temporary though.Elaine - going on leave would kill me - being home now is killing me. I LOVE my job. all of our paid time off is lumped together. I am using it now, but will be out soon due to all the darn appointments, etc. Wrong year to take my first ever in my life weeks vacation I guess!

            "answer": "Was just released form hospital. Sugar not quite controlled, but is coming down. It wasn't budging unitl last evening - had still been in mid to high 300's. This morning I was 231 - lowest I've been. HMOs want to get you out though, but this time there's more organization - endocrinologist in place, in home nurse again for a couple visits, had diabetes education and nutrition consult inpatient, and there's an actual plan for how to get to where I need to be.You'll have to excuse my typing - still can't see too well. Trying to correct as I catch them.I now have an insulin pen rather than the syringes. Tough to tell if you've pushed in enough to administer, but I'll get used to it. I was quite dehydrated (had ridiculous diarrhea for a few days prior to admit - had IV fluids the entire time I was there. The fluids knocked my electrolytes off balance, so I had IV calcium and magnesium too. I feel better.My doc said there are a handful of folks whose diabetes is just resistant to treatment, so naturally I would be one of those. Guess that's true since my levels didn't come down even in the hospital. Really I think being left swinging in the breeze had a lot to do with it too. It was good to see the portions that my meals came in there - gives me a better feel for what I can eat, which is more than I thought depending on what you choose to eat! I had been afraid to eat adn was hardly eating anything; guess that's not good either. This is tough, but I'll get the hang of it.My poor DH was running like a wild man and couldn't get near a computer. Running right form work to the hospital and then falling asleep as soon as he got home. Thank you all so much for thinking of me while I was there.Penn",

    "question": "I wanted to thank everyone who answered my DH's first venture onto the forum!I did go to the ER on Sunday late (vision like through vasoline, WAY off balance, nausea) and was kept. I had thought \"well maybe this will get me my repeat MRI\". They took me straight back in a chair when they saw how badly I was struggling to stand.Ironically the far bigger issue was the combination of the vision and nausea (thought the nausea was due to the balance). They said the balance is the neuro issue and they'd leave it to Dr McDreamy as he's \"the guru\". My bloodwork showed sugar @ 456! I've had it checked regularly and its been normal as recently as a couple months ago. They said it was triggered by an infection, and I've probably had the hyperglycemia for a few weeks - about when my vision started to fade! Could've knocked me over with a feather.When I was released my sugar was only down to 350. Since then its been the same or somewhat worse, despite increasing my med (glucophage), then changing the med and increasing THAT one. Last night I hit 400, so I was told this am I have to go on insulin (caused a good cry - I remember my mother dealing w/ insulin). A nurse is coming tomorrow and a few more times to teach us how to inject. Worse thing is I do not know when I can go back to work and they're really pushing me to go on leave.I know in the grand scheme of things insulin is not that big a deal, but my mother was double dosed in the hospital when she was first diagnosed (I was in middle school) and nearly died. I'm sure they've gotten better since then:)Anyway, feeling crappy both physically and emotionally. Vision getting better though. Done whining now. When I feel a little better I need to get caught up on how all of you are doing... have missed you.Penn",
