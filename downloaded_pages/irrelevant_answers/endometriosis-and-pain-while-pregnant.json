Im just trying to stay positive.",

            "answer": "I did not have much pain while I was pregnant, but I was very sick. I threw up at least once a day for the first trimester. I constantly felt nauseous and sick. I gained a lot of water weight and had a hard time walking. I developed gestational diabetes and hypertension. I did not know at the time that I had endo, but now many of my symptoms make more sense. My first midwife was totally confused about why I was having such a rough time. She kept blaming me and my eating habits; which is why I fired her!If I were able to get pregnant again I've been told that I would be on bed rest for 9 months. I'm older now and my endo is worse. So, I do not think that we will even try to have another. Eventually we may look into adoption.",
