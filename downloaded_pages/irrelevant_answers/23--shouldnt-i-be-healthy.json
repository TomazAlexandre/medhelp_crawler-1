    "question": "Dear Docs,I'm 23 year old female. I get dizzy, nausea, acid reflux, chest\u00a0\u00a0plevic and back pains. I work out 5 days a week in additon to chasing my 2 1/2 year old around, I eat extremely healthy, I quit smoking a year ago, I rearly drink, and can't seem to get into a healthy BMI weight, or make myself feel better. And I'm always tired. I haven't had health insurance since my hubby got out of the marines. I went to a low income clinic. The Doc there asked me what I thought was wrong. I told her my symptoms and my family health history of thyroid problems. But I told her that I had no idea what was wrong, and all the things I had been trying to do to make it better. She asked if I wanted her to test my throid. I said sure if thats what you think is wrong. She said that that sounded like it. She did one blood test. When the results came back her nurse called me and said that \"it looks normal enough.\" ( in those words) They told me to see a nutritionist. I've seen plenty of nutritionist while under the navy's medical care. Obviously I have limited resources. The doctors that I can afford will only test me for what I ask them to test for, and no one wants to help me figure out what is wrong. I have a very high threshold for pain. But the things I have been experiencing are making me hurt so bad that I can't move sometimes. Especially with the acid reflux making it hard to swallow, and the getting dizzy while I'm just sitting there. Please I know that this sight is not meant to diagnose, and I appreciate the time you are taking to answer questions. If you have any suggestions for me on what I might do to make these things go away and be healthy, or even a medical clinic that would be alittle more helpful, please let me know. Thankyou for all of your time and effort.",
