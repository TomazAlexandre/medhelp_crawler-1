            "answer": "Hi, what is described is glove and stocking neuropathy. Beside diabetes, trauma and infections, vitamin deficiencies namely B vitamins, including B1, B6 and B12, are particularly important to nerve health. Vitamin E and niacin also are crucial to nerve health. Not having enough of these vitamins in your system may cause peripheral neuropathy. Kidney disease, liver disease, connective tissue disorders, an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) and amyloidosis also can cause peripheral neuropathy. Check with your doctor to rule out these conditions. Regards.",
