Normal pregnancies usually have longer intervals between appointments versus the high risk that need closer monitoring. Don't be afraid to ask questions or find out when they plan to do bloodwork.Good luck and congratulations",

    "question": "When I had my Dr appt. All he did was question about how early I had my daughter, give me an ultrasound and then let me know what we were going to do to keep my little one in as long as possible. No blood work no nothing. With my daughter I had a different Dr and he did my blood and all that. Is it because I'm high risk that he didn't test or what? Did you ladies get blood drawn the first appt?",
