            "answer": "When my blood sugar drops I experience the shaking and sick feeling you are describing.\u00a0\u00a0But the tricky thing about blood sugar is the symptoms are pretty much the same if your sugar is to high, as they are when its to low.\u00a0\u00a0Are you a diabetic? Does this run in your family? You should eat regular meals.\u00a0\u00a0My dietian says it is healthier to eat 6-7 small meals a day than 3 large ones.\u00a0\u00a0You are not as hungry between meals and do not tend to over eat.\u00a0\u00a0But not eating can cause your sugar to drop and can be just as dangerous as it being to high. You should sit down and write yourself a menu for the day and stick to it.\u00a0\u00a0Healthy breakfast, light snack (like yogurt and fruit), lunch, light snack, dinner, light snack (if you are still hungry).\u00a0\u00a0Trust me it is much easier to manage your weirght and keep track of what you eat this way.\u00a0\u00a0And you are not talking to a skinny girl here, I struggle to keep my weight in check.",
