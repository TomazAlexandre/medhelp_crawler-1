            "answer": "Hello,What you are having is excessive sweating. It can occur either due to genetic reason or secondary to physiological or disease conditions such as excessive intake of certain foods, caffeine, drugs, nicotine, anxiety, excessively functioning thyroid or pituitary gland, gout, diabetes, menopausal state or neurological causes.I think getting a thyroid profile tested in the lab may help and also please consult a dermatologist to find out the confirmatory diagnosis as treatment depends on the same.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
