            "answer": "Hello,Numbness of limbs is found in diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis,motor neuron disease,TIA, underactive thyroid, abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, sodium in your body and a lack of vitamin B12.Pls get your blood sugar and minerals levels evaluated.Take vit B 12 for some days and see if the\u00a0\u00a0numbness persists.The bowel problems of diarrhea and nausea after eating and white coating of the tongue may be due to GERD(gastro esophageal reflux disease), acute non-GI infections (pyelonephritis, pneumonia),gastroenteritis,liver diseases, pancreatic disorder,peptic disease of upper GI tract,gastric carcinoma,CNS diseases like infections, tumors, multiple sclerosis and metabolic disturbances like diabetes and adrenal insufficiency.Similarly white tongue is found in GI and liver disorders.I feel that you need consultation from a gastroenterologist and a neurologist and lots of investigations to weed out the above possibilities and find a confirmatory diagnosis.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Hello,As I have said earlier,viral infection can be thought of as a possibility after simple blood tests but to confirm it special tests are needed.Similarly HIV can cause some blood changes like thrombocytopenia(low platelets),neutopenia(low neutrophils)and eosinophilia(high eosinophils).Bot these changes can be caused in many other illnesses.So confirmation is only done by specific tests for HIV like western blot,PCR and ELISA.These tests may show accuracy after 6 weeks to 6 months as HIV antibodies take time to develop in the body.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
