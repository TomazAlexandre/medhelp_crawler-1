            "answer": "\"I was diagnosed yesterday with type two diabetes.\"What were the names of the test/s and what were the result/s? Do you have a family history of diabetes? Usually glucose testing requires additional testing to verify/backup the first. The current gold standard for testing for diabetes is called the A1c test. The results are presented in % [percent]. Normal would be under 5%. If you didn't get an A1c, ask for it.",

I think an uncle has diabetes not sure which type, he is estranged from the family. But other than that no immediate family members have it. The doctor did the two hour glucose tolerance test. results for that were fasting sugars 147 (she said under 99 was normal i think) 1hr 159 2hr 156, they also measured insulin at all three time points she said it was high at all three but did not give specific numbers. lastly they did the hemoglobin A1C she said normal was below five mine was 6.7I have never tested at home before I am suppose to follow up with her when I am back on campus after our away meet.",

            "answer": "Glad you posted back. The A1c confirms that your daily average glucose is 146 mg/dl which verifies your fasting level as t2 diabetes. You will need to obtain a home glucose test meter and test at specific times of the day. Ask your doctor for one, or where to obtain one in your area. Please read other threads on this forum as test times and the lifestyle change you must undergo to control and manage your glucose levels - foods to eat and avoid - are mentioned quite often.Be sure to check in with your doctor upon returning from your meet as he/she may start you on oral medication. Don't worry, you can still live a normal life with just a few sacrifices, it is not the end of world as diabetes can be easily controlled and managed. Good luck",

All T2'ers must \"cut out\" and avoid sugary foods, foods made with added sugars, sugary liquids, foods made with white flour, simple carbs, starchy foods such as white rice and potatoes, to name a few. Also, paying attention to carb intake while testing postprandial is a requirement to understand what one can and cannot consume. To suggest to someone they can eat whatever they wish in any portion & frequency is unsound advice which results in elevated glucose levels.",

            "answer": "blondeballerina07 - Be sure to test before, during, and 20-30 minutes after workouts when your body comes to rest. This way you'll understand how your workout regimen affected your glucose. Do not begin a workout if your levels are low or above 250 mg/dl [see previous posters comment on dangers]. Be sure to discuss with your sports doctor foods to consume for energy/fuel during workouts that will not jack up your glucose levels and/or see a sports nutritionist/dietitian. I carry home-made sugar free granola bars and a bag of various nuts while cycling. I'm aquabike, and envy you tri-ers.",

You can probably live pretty normally if you are conscientious about the rules. There are many possible causes of diabetes, and they are not all clearly understood. Genetics play a big factor, as well as diet, but it is suspected that an unidentified virus or retrovirus may be responsible for other cases.",

    "question": "Hi I am new here. I was diagnosed yesterday with type two diabetes. I am very shocked to say the least and a little over whelmed. I am 22years old and in what many would say to be excellent physical shape. I am a collegiate triathlete and train between 25-30 hours a week. I also eat healthy, no fast food, processed food and because of my training plan I am on a pretty strict eating plan. I guess what I am getting at is I would have never seen this coming. I was informed over the phone by my sports med doctor and was unable to get a follow until monday because I am traveling for a race. I am overwhelmed and to be truthful completely freaked out at the moment. I am nervous to eat anything high in sugar or carbs but also know I can't make it through my race without those things. Any little advice that would help put my mind at ease until I can follow up would be great.",
