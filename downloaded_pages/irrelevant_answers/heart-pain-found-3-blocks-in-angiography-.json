            "answer": "It is often difficult to say what the best solution is (bypasses or stents).A lot depends on the skill of the cardiologist.A skillful placement of stents can be as durable as bypasses, while the recovery is much easier.Therefore, trying to stent and in case of failure switch to bypass surgery sounds like a good plan to me.The ostial proximal position in the LAD is often difficult to stent. I think that is the position the will first try to open.If that is a success, the other two seem easier to me.",

    "question": "My father had a pain in heart last night.after check up doctor said it doesn't seem to be major problem but they will do angiography test to find outwhether there is any major blocks..after angiography the result was ,there is a problem in 3 vessels.I want to know in this case whether angioplasty or bypass surgery is better.doc said they will try to do angioplasty in 1 St vessel if it is sucess they will do angioplasty in other 2 vessels .If angioplasty in first vessel\u00a0\u00a0is a failure then they go for a immediate bypass surgery.. I don't know what to do ..will any please help..The result is as followsLMCA: 5.5 mm vessel ,bifurcates into LAD & LCX.disease freeLAD: Ostio proximal LAD total occlusion .LAD is seen filling through hetero collateralsLCX:non dominant ,4.0 mm,gives rise to OM1(3.0mm),OM2(2.6mm)& continues az terminal OM(2.5).proximal LCX has 20-30% disease .Distal LCX to terminal OM has 90% disease with TIMI flow distallyRCA: dominant ,4.0 mm vessel gives rise to SA nodal RV branch RPDA(2.5 mm)& RPLB (2.5 mm) .Mid RCA has tubular eccentric 90% disease.pre crux RCA has 30 % disease",
