    "question": "Seven months ago my boyfriend and I began having sex, and about two weeks later I started my period but noticed that I was having major pain and itching internally and externally towards the end of my period. I went to the OB/GYN and I did have a yeast infection for the first time ever. I wasn't on any birth control, nor taking any antibiotics, not pregnant, and the pap came back normal with no diseases. She gave me a pill, it worked for a week, so I got the 2nd pill filled and that seemed to clear it up. About two months later I was having the symptoms again but hadn't started my period yet, so I decided to take the Monistat 7. That also worked. The next month I started the NuvaRing. A little over a month later, on the day that my period ended I had the itching and \"Cottage Cheese\" discharge again. I am doing Monistat 7 again. My boyfriend doesn't have any of the symptoms of a yeast infection, but we read that oral sex could cause my yeast infection. Is there anything that he could treat himself with to help me out? I have given him the external tube of Monistat, but it says its for itching, and he doesn't have anything??",
