            "answer": "Nice question as soda has never been brought up on this forum before. It's not an easy yes/no answer w/o having to divulge on some fundamental facts for a clearer understanding on why one should or should not drink sodas in limited moderation.Actually, no soda - regular or diet - is good to drink due to the high levels of acid they contain. [pour a little over your car battery, wipe it off and see how much gunk is removed by the acid.This is what it does as goes down your throat.]Also, Aspartame, which as of 2011 is the primary sweetener in Diet Pepsi, has been the subject of controversy, most notably in 1996 amid a 60 Minutes report on concerns alleging that aspartame might be linked to the development of brain tumors in humans.Regular Pepsi contains 41 grams of sugar per 12 oz. can/bottle. This equals a little under 6 heaping Tablespoons of sugar! Talk about jacking up your glucose levels. In addition, the calorie count puts unnecessary weight around your midsection too - a BIG thumbs down.For your diabetes, the three key items in controlling and managing your diabetes are; proper nutrition, maintaining proper weight, and 30 minutes of daily physical exercise. The medication is there to 'help' you when you make ALL the aforementioned a daily habit. Medication will not lower your glucose levels by itself. Read other threads on this forum as proper nutrition - what to eat, what not to eat - has been discussed many times over. Post back if you have further questions. Good luck",
