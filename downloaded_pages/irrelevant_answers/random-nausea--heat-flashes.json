            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you have headaches and hot flashes and lightheadedness with a feeling of passing out, you could be having either polycystic ovarian disease or GERD with or without H pylori infection. These are the two conditions to be ruled out first. Commonest cause of chronic nausea is acidity. Take omeprazole (empty stomach in morning) and antacid gel and see if it helps. Liver and kidney dysfunction is another cause. Hence kidney and liver function tests should be done. Other causes are diabetes and hypothyroidism. Electrolyte imbalance too can cause nausea. IBS, gluten or lactose intolerance, parasites in gut too can be the cause. A stool test should be done for worms, giardiasis etc. Also if nothing is found then food challenge test to detect food intolerance should be done.I would strongly recommend you to see a gastroenterologist (a specialist who looks after the diseases of our digestive system). It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Take care!",

    "question": "Hello, I joined today specifically to ask this question.I am 18 years old, and for the past year I've experienced random waves of nausea and heat flashes. These heat flashes last about 1-3 minutes, in which case I must sit down until it passes. The nausea happens usually after the morning. Sleeping helps it go away, but of course it comes back after a few hours. It gets especially worse if I haven't eaten, but even if I do, it still happens.It was only recently that the nausea and heat flashes have been happening more and more often. I don't know why it happens. I am not pregnant, and this has been happening for quite some time. I don't take any prescribed medication, just sometimes the occasional Benedryl for allergies.Even right now I feel sick :/. But I don't ever throw up.Anyone else feel like this too? If so are there any ways to prevent it?Thank you.",
