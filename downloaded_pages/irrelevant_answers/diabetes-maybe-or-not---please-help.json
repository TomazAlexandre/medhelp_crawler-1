            "answer": "Ask your doctor to check ha1c, which will give you average blood sugar levels over past few months.Your levels do sound diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe you have type 1.5, which is autoimmune (you can google it for more info).Diet and exercise are very important to management. How\u00a0\u00a0are you going with diet and exercise?I would think you need to keep working on the testosterone levels too.work closely with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0It is very important to control this now and avoid long term problems.You may feel bad when your glucose comes down becuase your body is used to the levels being high. However, this should not be the reason to leave the levels high.\u00a0\u00a0there is risk to your health if levels cannot be normalised.\u00a0\u00a0It can take a while to get use to having 'normal' levels.",

    "question": "Hi There, I'm a recently turned 40year old male,living in Malaysia. I have a history of neck issues (cervical spondylitis)?Sometime later Sept - Oct 09, stiffness of the neck and head getting heavy had me run to my GP for advise. He checked my blood sugar and it was 22 Mmol. I also have had elevated blood sugar problems when I had a boil somewhere on the body or the neck getting stiff, after a while it went away. I've not had the other symptoms of Diabetes2 like frequent urination, weight loss etc. Dr. started me off with Galvusmet 100mg. It did not lower my blood sugar below 7+, switch to Glugophage didn't lower below 7+ either. Currently on JanuMet, same thing. My average blood glucose level is 8-9+ (that's when I feel perfectly normal) if it starts to drop to below 8 to 6.5 etc..i get queasy in the gut, feel like loosing my balance, arms and legs like cramping etc. Checks have also shown that I have fatty liver.A little history to before Sept09, I was always feeling fatigued, Blood test revealed that my Testosterone count was almost ZERO, I was prescribed ANRDROL TESTO CAPS. That brought it up a little. Then when back for a second dosage and that's when all hell broke loose. Once I started on the diabetes meds, stopped the Testosterone caps, also taking liver tonic, I.e. Milk Thistle or LIV 52 keeps the glucose level elevated. The Moment I stop those things improve. BUT I'm not able to live normally or feel normally if the blood glucose levels fall below 7ish.Last night had dinner by 9pm, went to bed. This morning blood sugar was 9.5Mmol. I am beginning to think that I might not have diabetes in the first place (not in denial) but something else that has not been diagnosed, plus it feels like i'm a garden hose with constant pressure one. IF someone can suggest or recommend steps that I should take, appreciate it. Ohh..almost forgot, recently my hair have started to fall out quite a bit.Thanks DomThis discussion is related to/posts/show/696430.",
