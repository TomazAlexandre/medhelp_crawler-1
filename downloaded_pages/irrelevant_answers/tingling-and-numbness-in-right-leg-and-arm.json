            "answer": "Tingling and numbness can be signs of nerve damage caused by uncontrolled and unmanaged diabetes - excess and unknown glucose levels. Does your husband have a home glucose test meter and is he testing his glucose levels at the appropriate times? More can said about this once we hear back from you. Also, not mentioned is his last A1c test result.As far as diet everyone has a take on a healthy diet but few read nutrition labels for hidden sugars and excess carbohydrates [carbs to a t2 diabetic is the same as sugar]. Fruit contains fructose [aka fruit sugar]. There are diabetics, like myself, who cannot tolerate any fruits in any amount. Fruits to us is the same as ingesting pure granulated sugar. This is where home testing is valuable, to see what foods your husband can and cannot tolerate. If you wish to know about this you can send me a PM or read other forum post a few pages back as proper nutrition has been posted numerous times.Lastly, it also sounds as if his doctor is blowing him off by not performing follow up testing. It might behoove your husband to get a referral to an Endocrinologist, a doctor who specializes in diabetes care and treatment. Good luck",

            "answer": "You're welcome, SS2003. Yes, a fasting level of 87 mg/dl is perfect. Normal ranges are 60/70 to 99 mg/dl. He needs to continue working on lowering his levels. Losing weight helps a lot along with daily exercise and eating a proper diabetic nutrition. An A1c of 7.7% says his daily glucose level is 174 mg/dl, HIGH. Even 7% is high as it equates to 154 mg/dl. Ideal level is <5% = 97 mg/dl.As mentioned in my prior post his numbness and tingling can be associated with nerve damage. If this continues he should see an Endocrinologist [diabetes specialist]. He may then get referred to a Neurologist [nerve damage specialist] for advanced treatment. The key for the moment is for him to test, test, test at home. Test before a meal [preprandial] then 2-3 hours after postprandial]. Before provides a baseline measurement while postprandial tells how the foods consumed affected his levels. Avoid those that do, especially foods laden with carbohydrates.",

            "answer": "You're welcome, glad to help out. I understand your husbands discomfort using a lancet on his fingertip, I don't particularly care for them either - didn't as a kid and still don't. However, as you've seen on the iNet there are meters on the market which allow obtaining blood samples from other less painful areas, the forearm and palm.I'm not all that up-to-date on these type of meters but several I recall are Johnson & Johnsons Lifescan [fingertips, forearms and palms] and Abbot Laboratories Freestyle [fingertips and palms]. J&J recommends rubbing the area first for more blood flow, then cleaning area prior using the lancet. J&J also recommends testing on fingertip too to insure there is no large descrepency between test sites, where fingertip is considered more reliable. If none exist just use forearm/palm from then on.

            "answer": "Your husband's fasting levels fall into the normal range. His postprandial is high and should fall into the normal fasting ranges. Pay careful attention these food types as they are easily digested and quickly enter the bloodstream as sugar; carbohydrate foods, starches like potatoes, foods made with flour [breads, crackers], white rice, and dairy milk. I'm not saying he cannot eat them but to pay attention to portion sizes, limit intake and/or avoid intake. Instead focus on whole grains, vegies, fish and poultry and lean meats. Fruits contain fructose, fruit sugar. To some diabetics fruits are the same as table sugar.These are the glucose ranges:Normal fasting - 60/70 to 99 mg/dlPrediabetes - 100 to 125 mg/dlPostprandial - same as fasting. For diabetics <141 mg/dl, optimum <121 mg/dl.Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "\"That means his sugar level is high than it should be..could you please explain?\"First, kudos to your husband for understanding and doing what he has to do in order to control and manage his diabetes. Kudos to you too for caring.If testing 2-3 hours after a meal his 123 postprandial is high. Goal is to be within normal fasting ranges, 60/70-99 mg/dl. Pay attention to salad dressings if from a bottle. Most contain sugar, some in form of carbohydrate sugar where every 7 grams equals one heaping tablespoon of sugar. Eat fruits in smaller portions and with other foods to slow the absorption of fructose. I personally avoid root vegies, vegies that grow downward - carrots, radishes, etc - as they contain more sugar than I can tolerate.",
