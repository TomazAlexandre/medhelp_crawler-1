            "answer": "If he is drinking alot there ia about a 90% chance that it is a bladder infection. Does the unrine have a strong smell to it?It could also be stones too like peekawho stated but in that case he will be going out often and you will notice that he will try to go and very little urine will come out at times.Take a sample with you to the Vet so they can do a quick Culture and get him on an antibiotic.Let us know how you make out. Hopefully that is all it is.",

            "answer": "My first thought when you said that he was drinking a lot of water was that he had become diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I'm glad you took him to the vet when you did.Animals can lead amazingly normal lives with diabetes, you just have to be diligent in whatever method you and your vet choose to control it, be it diet or medication.Good luck to you and your doggie.\u00a0\u00a0Please stay around and keep us updated as to how you guys are doing with his treatment.\u00a0\u00a0:)Ghilly",

            "answer": "I'm sorry to hear that it is Diabetes but you seem to have caught it early. Hopefully medication and diet will do it for him.The fact that you said he was acting normal in all other ways steered me away from Diabetes as they usually become lethargic with the disease. When they have the bladder infection they are usually normal other than the changes in urination.I wish you both well with treatment and let us know what the Vet decides treatment for his condition is going to be.Dino",

            "answer": "Thank you all so much for the replies and for caring.Ernie is really so sweet-we would do anything to help him..The vet has him on low doses-2x a day- of Vesalin(insulin) he seems to be doing ok with it-so far...He also has a gall bladder problem which we are giving him anti-biotics.Doc seemed to think this is an ongoing med-Gall Bladder is very sludgy.Hopefully we can control this problem too.My hubby was a Navy Medic and is very comfortable with the injections-I am going to wait till we get the doseage correct before I try...(OMG!) I think I can handle this.I will let y'all know what happens....So far his appitite is good,he is very playful and the drinking has slowed down.......No more wetting inside-Thank God.Thank you all again.....Erniesmom",
