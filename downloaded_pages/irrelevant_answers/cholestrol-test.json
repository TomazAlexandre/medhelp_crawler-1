            "answer": "What are triglycerides?Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood. When you eat, your body converts any calories it doesn't need to use right away into triglycerides. The triglycerides are stored in your fat cells. Later, hormones release triglycerides for energy between meals. If you regularly eat more calories than you burn, you may have high triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia).What's the difference between triglycerides and cholesterol?Triglycerides and cholesterol are separate types of fats (lipids) that circulate in your blood. Triglycerides provide your body with energy, and cholesterol is used to build cells and certain hormones. Because triglycerides and cholesterol can't dissolve in blood, they circulate throughout your body with the help of proteins that transport the lipids, called lipoproteins.You may find this information helpful ... http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cholesterol-test/CL00033Hope this helps ... best wishes,Ranae",

When you eat, your body converts any calories it doesn't need to use right away into triglycerides, which are stored in fat cells and released later for energy. High triglyceride levels usually mean you regularly eat more calories than you burn. High levels are also seen in overweight people, in those consuming too many sweets or too much alcohol, and in people with diabetes who have elevated blood sugar levels.",
