            "answer": "you must be so proud of yourself...overcoming addiction while ontop of that having diabetes and now also trying to lose weight. its awesome. i dont know your whole story but im glad that wherever you have been this is where you have taken yourself now... i do know a lot about 'dieting' though. so here are my suggestions. i know that its hard with the diabetes but i would check out something caled the 5 day plan. its more of a planned out thing so it helps with what you need to do on a daily basis. the reason diets fail so often is because its like depriving yourself of natural needs. but just check it out it may work for you. i know it helped my best friend lose 96 lbs in the past 5 months along with exercise and she is also a diabetic and an addict so given the situation it may also work for you. rather than methadone she is on suboxone because it just was a better option for her situation. just like plans of sobrity, diet plans need to be based on your unique situation. i dont know much about your rx combo but i hope this helps! good luck and congrats on your success!",

Picked back up taking pictures a past time that I use to love but when I was using forgot all about it.Here is question I know that you all are not doctors just wondering if maybe anyone is going through it or has been there. I am diabetes i take methformin 500mg day and just found out that I have a thyroid problem and they put me on meds for that. I am also on methadone and was wondering if that was safe together or if any side effects ...I was told that the 3 together was fine and would be no problems just wondering if anyone had tips....also i have just started dieting for I have gained 60lbs since having diabetes any good diets out there I have lost 3 lbs so far 50 more go and since I can't eat so many foods b/c sugar it's hard. WELL thanks for reading and taking time post I am trying really hard to get my life back and loose weight so I can feel better. Have a good day all......Best Regards,Holliee",
