            "answer": "Hey babe, it's so so nice to see you come up on the boards again :DTheoretically, peripheral neuropathy is suppose to be one of the MS differentials because the peripheral nerves are not involved, it was thought that when an MSer did have peripheral nerve damage it was from a secondary co-morbid issue eg diabetes, Sj\u00f6gren's, arthritis, nutritional deficiencies, alcoholism, immobility, injury, medication, thyroid gland dysfunction etcThere isn't much MS research on the topic and what there is is incomplete to me, they all seem to have 'very small' studies groups (5-70) with criteria restrictions eg dx MS and nerve conductor evidence of PN, the criteria would be producing high stats than the general MS populous.....to give you an idea one study concludes an MSer can additionally develop the rare chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) but there was only 5 people in the study.I'm not sure if i'm helping, all i can say is that it's definitely possible to have MS and another autoimmune condition or conditions, autoimmune peripheral neuropathy would have to be possible, how common it would be i'm not sure, if it is symmetrical or a-symmetrical again i'm not sure, sorry!The nerve conductor studies etc should help shed some light into what else 'could be' going on along with the MS, try to keep open minded cause the idea might not pan out....Hugs.....JJ",

            "answer": "Hi there! Good to see you again. Sorry about hubby's illness though.I had a \"relapse\" about a year and a half ago and my neuro didn't think it was MS related (both hands lost grip strength but one side was definitely weaker than the other). He ordered a nerve conduction study because he had always thought I had something neurological going on in addition to the MS...Nerve conduction was normal so he called it an MS relapse officially but it does seem that it is possible to have other nerve issues with MS.I hope they figure it out soon though.Corrie",

I was diagnosed with small fiber pn with no known cause negative for diabetes etc. Confirmed by punch biopsy didn't hurt much. Had several emgs done now those hurt and a muscle biopsy in my thigh was knocked out for that one.\u00a0\u00a0Have tried lyrica worked well for a few years severe allergy to baclofen and currently like you no relapses or lesions just progression.\u00a0\u00a0Saw my Neuro on Friday wants to try new med once fda approval goes thru thinking about it for now.",
