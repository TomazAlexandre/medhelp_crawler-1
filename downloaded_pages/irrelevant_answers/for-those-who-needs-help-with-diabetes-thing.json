            "answer": "We cannot endorse products that are sold on the web or in any other place. Remember that when we see testimonials on the web, we never really can tell whether they are true or not. I did check out this website, and must warn that although herbal remedies may help type 2 folks who actually produce insulin, type 1 diabetes is not at all a problem with insulin resistance, but is instead an autoimmune disease whereby the pancreas cells have actually been destroyed by the body's own immune system. A type 1 diabetic normally has no insulin resistance problems at all, but just cannot produce insulin. There is no herbal remedy that will replace insulin -- at this time, ALL type 1 people must inject insulin in order to survive.",

I am not an expert in Diabetes, however thinking of that I understand that giving people chemicals for a lifetime is a perfect business, isn't it?Of course it CANNOT REPLACE INSULIN, but as people say, this control24online made them GET RID OF INSULIN at all. They dont need it anymore and feeling great. No idea about their diabetes type.Please don't take it personally, I am writing in general and I tend to believe herbs much more than chemistry, especially when there is a live evidence from tens prooving that. There are multiple people on that site, but I meant I know personally some of them for a long time.You have to see them stopping being diabetic after hearing \"insuling for survival\" for years.Chinese 5000 years wisdom vs. less than 100 years western insulin business",
