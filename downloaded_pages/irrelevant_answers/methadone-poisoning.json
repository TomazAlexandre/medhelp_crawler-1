            "answer": "Thank you so very much for answering.I continue to have these epidsodes in my life. Up four hours, sleep four hours. I went back on my meth really low doses at a time. However,I had an episode at the shrink/case managers officers. I must have been up four hours. I couldn't see, couldn't walk. I had to be taken home. Here's the thing. The MD keep asking me about diabetes. I don't have family, so I don't know. Went home to my trusty computer. I may have a type of Protein-Energy Undernutrition or PEU.Now I know this doesn't seem to have anything to do with our community,but if you would rather ear junk food then a real meal because real meals make you sleepy and sugar doesn't this may effect or be useful to someone.Thank you for being so kind. The thought of giving up what gets me out of bed everyday is beyond depressing. love,love,love",
