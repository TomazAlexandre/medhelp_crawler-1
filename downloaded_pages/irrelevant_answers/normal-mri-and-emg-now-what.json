Those test the peripheral nerves and should be negative in early MS.\u00a0\u00a0The next step, if you can get your neuro to do them would be the VEP, and I would also recommend the SSEP, and an LP.\u00a0\u00a0Have they sent the western blot for Lyme, plus for all the other \"mimics?\"I, also,\u00a0\u00a0do believe that a person can have lesions that are too small to show up on MRI's.\u00a0\u00a0Even that all of one's lesions can be undetectable early.\u00a0\u00a0It just makes it hard to diagnose.\u00a0\u00a0Rmeind us:\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any abnormal results or abnormalities on your exam?Have to ask.\u00a0\u00a0What was the power of the MRI machine?Quix",

            "answer": "Hello Quix, Good to be back here. Yes, I'm a little pleased about about the MRI results, but I'm still in the dark about my Dx. I'm not sure about the NCS. I will have to ask my Neuro on monday about that. I did get my results for my Lyme tests.\u00a0\u00a0The PCR tests were negative for lyme. The IgG Western Blot was negative overall, the IgM Western Blot was positive. I don't know how to interpret the positive IgM because the others were negative and it said that it could possibly be a false positive.So far I have not had any abnormal results on any of the tests. My blood work came back fine. No Lupus, Thyroid, Diabetes or anything else that they tested me for. Keeps pointing me back to MS though as tha cause. The MRI machine was a 3 Telsa. I was hoping it would have given me a clue into what is going on, but looks like I will have to go the whole route for a Dx.The nutritionist/chiropractor guy I saw today said he saw some some slightly abnormal reactions to\u00a0\u00a0some of the reflex and eye movement exams. He said I should have shown more of a sharper reaction to some of the stimuli. I have noticed some slight changes in my speech, writing and cognitive functions seem a little slower, but not super\u00a0\u00a0noticeable. He has been the first medical person I've seen to be leaning toward MS a Dx and not lyme.Quix, thanks for you help and support, you are a God sent to all on this forum.Rick",

    "question": "I just got my MRI and my EMG results. Brain, C-spine and thoracic spine are normal. My EMG showed some slight Carpal tunnel in my hands. I went to a nutritionist today who treats people with MS and he did some reflex tests and said that he thinks I have the classic symptoms of the early onset of MS. He also said that The MRI might be \"normal\" but still could have lesions that are \" microscopic\" in size.I will be seeing a new Neuro on monday who is supposed to be an MS specialist. What should be my next step be? VEP? Lumbar punture?",
