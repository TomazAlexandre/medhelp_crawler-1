            "answer": "Hi,I'm not the greatest at answering; but here is my situation. I have muscle leg, foot, arm and hand twitches. I was diagnosed, (among other things) with Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS). It does not necessarily only affect your legs.There is also something called Periodic Limb Movement, but as I understand it, this only happens when you're asleep. RLS, on the other-hand, can be all day and all night. It usually is at its worse when you try to sit still at night.I am on my second med with this, but am not finding much relief; the first one, Carbadopa, helped initially, and then not. Now I am on Mirapex, and again, it helped initially and now it is not, even though the dosage(s) were increased.You may want to schedule and appointment with a neurologist, just to get a check; make sure you look into what other symptoms (sx's) you may be experiencing, even if they seem unrelated.Good luck and keep us posted!",

            "answer": "Hello,One possibility for your symptoms is restless leg syndrome. It is a disorder of the part of the nervous system that affects movements of the legs. Because it usually interferes with sleep, it also is considered a sleep disorder.Sometimes restless leg syndrome can be caused by diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, Cigarette smoking, magnesium or Vit B12 deficiency.Get your blood tests for any kind of anemia done. Also get yourself evaluated for diabetes by blood sugar levels. Polysomnography (sleep testing) may be necessary to diagnose the sleep disturbances and determine if you have periodic limb movements. Sometimes Needle electromyography and nerve conduction studies may be done for signs of neuropathy.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Is it that it is moving or that you feel the need to move it and are thus unable to keep it still. I get to the point at night when I am sleeping where I just can't be still and have to constantly move by legs in order to feel comfortable. I know that this is from anxiety. You should try to make sure you are extremely tired, relaxed, and have nothing on your mind when you go to sleep. If this helps, then it is definitely anxiety related, which is why the medication initially helps.Our mind is very powerful and even when do not think it has a role in situations, it still does. Always try to rule out the psychological when you are also ruling out the medical.",
