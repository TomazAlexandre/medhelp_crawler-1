            "answer": "Hi,How are you?At the moment the possibility of MS seems very thin. Since you do not have any neurological symptoms apart from the headache, it does not seem to be serious problem.There can be many causes of white matter lesions like viral illnesses, chronic headache, migraine, diabetes, high BP, alcoholism, smoking, old age and MS and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.In your case it could be just due to headache. So please relax.Hope this was helpful!",

            "answer": "Have you looked into atherosclerosis or lupus? I was reading about these awhile ago since I have joint aches/pains that are part of a myriad of symptoms to some undiagnosed condition I have, and I recall reading that both of these cause white matter in the pons on an MRI. I only remember this because I had an MRI done and I looked at my images to see if I noticed anything the radiologist might've missed.",

    "question": "Hello I am a 35yr old women with severe persistent Asthma.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the ER on 8/6/08 because of a severe headache that my specialist believed was a adverse reaction to Xolair. (It is a IgE blocker).\u00a0\u00a0At any rate the ER did a CT scan that came back abnormal.\u00a0\u00a0Since then my doctor ordered an MRI the following is the Impression:1.Bilateral cerebal white matter signal hyperintensity, particularly within the centrum semioval, and pons.\u00a0\u00a0There is associated enhancement within the centum semiovale, more so on the right.\u00a0\u00a0Differential considerations include demyelinating disorder such as MS, post viral sequelae, vasculopathy such as vasculitis and chronic headaches/migraine.\u00a0\u00a0Clinical and laboratory correlation requested.2.\u00a0\u00a0Low signal intensity within the basal ganglia bilaterally, which would correlate to dense calcifications seen on recent CT dated 8/6/08.\u00a0\u00a0Basal ganglia calcifications can be idiopathic, related to hypoparathyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, Fahr's disease, and post inflammatory conditions.\u00a0\u00a0Clinical correlation requested.My doctor has had all the metabolic test, serum tests, CBC etc and has ruled out any parathyroid problems.\u00a0\u00a0That is when I was sent to a neurolgist.\u00a0\u00a0He has begun treating me for the never ending head ache - which he believes is a result of the Xolair (which I have been taken off of) - because I never got headaches before I started taking it.\u00a0\u00a0It has been a month and the headache seems to come and go now - no where near like it was so I feel like it is getting a bit better for the\u00a0\u00a0most part.\u00a0\u00a0I am however worried about the MRI findings.\u00a0\u00a0Is this something I should be worried about or is it possible that it's nothing?",
