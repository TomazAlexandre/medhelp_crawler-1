            "answer": "Hi.Does this happen 100% of the time?Erectile problems and ejaculation problems have both structural and psychogenic factors to be considered. In your case, I suggest that you have this assessed by a urologist so that a complete physical examination and medical history may be done.Do you still experience nighttime erections?Any underlying disease conditions like diabetes?Any previous trauma or instrumentation to the area?Any recurrent forms of urinary tract infection?",

            "answer": "Hi.So this problem has been present for the past nine years?There may be an underlying nerve related problem which could be causing the numbness. Without full sensation, sexual response may be affected. I suggest that aside from a urologic consult, a neurologic consult may also help. This may be a superficial nerve related problem.Are there other areas with decreased sensation in other parts of the body?Any weakness of the extremities?Any spine problems or injuries before?",

            "answer": "Hi.A neurologic consult may be able to help. This will help localize an underlying nerve related problem. This may be due to a neuralgia which may occur if there are previous surgeries in the area. Or if there is a history of strenuous activities such as cycling activities which may suggest a pudendal neuralgia.At this point, the cause of the numbness has to be ascertained. Blood tests to determine blood sugar levels, thyroid hormone levels and testosterone levels may be done if indicated. Initially though, any structural problems involving the prostate may have to be excluded.",

    "question": "I am having a few different issues with my sexual performance. First off I am only 33 years old. it takes an unusually large amount of focusing to be able to ejaculate, Also my penis wont remain fully hard during intercourse. Its kind of like i lose sensation in my penis almost a numbing effect Like wearing 2 condoms at the same time\u00a0\u00a0And when I do finally ejaculate it seems very unfulfilling and weak. Even trying to self pleasure is a difficult task. This is very frustrating as I am married to a very young attractive woman.. Any help here would be greatly wanted.",
