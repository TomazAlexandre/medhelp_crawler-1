            "answer": "Hi,What other symptoms are present? I understand your concern regarding this and while it it is possible that certain foods such as salty and sweet foods can trigger a dull pain or throbbing sensation in the head, underlying issues such as hypertension, diabetes, migraine, food allergy\u00a0\u00a0and gastric reflux disease may need to be ruled out also. If it persists, it is best that you have this checked by your doctor for proper evaluation. Additional diagnostic tests may need to be done also. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "Hi,Lately I've noticed that I'm getting a headache after eating. Well, it's not really a headache but rather a sensation of coldness on my scalp. I don't get dizzy, maybe slightly sleepy.This headache sometimes I get also when hungry. It's very distracting, I just feel very weak. But even if I eat, sometimes the headache stays.I do have a deviated septum, which according to the doctor causes me to have low oxygen levels in my body. Could this be the reason? Soon I'll have a surgery to correct this.I have had my blood tested and it seems there is no diabetes. Somehow, I suspect this strange feeling has to do with that.I have big dark circles under my eyes.Any comment on this would be very helpful.Thank you!",
