            "answer": "Hi,How are you? The presence of protein in urine (proteinuria) is due to failure of kidney to filter the body fluids. This can occur due to infections to the kidney, hypertension, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, nephrotic syndrome etc. Although a single measure of protein in a urine sample has less significance. I would suggest that you get a 24 hour urine collection and estimation of protein in that. This is a reliable method to assess the condition.Due to surgery, there is no chance of having proteinuria. It would be better to consult a nephrologist in this regard.Best.",

            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in. There is no chance of developing proteinuria after surgery. In some cases proteinuria may be present before surgery in case of appendicitis. In case there has been urinary tract infection during this period, this could be the cause for proteinuria. I would suggest that you get a workup done for this for early initiation of treatment.Best.",
