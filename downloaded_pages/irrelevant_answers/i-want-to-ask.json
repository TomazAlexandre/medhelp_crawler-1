            "answer": "As stated it is not unexpected to have an increase in the heart rate, etc. after eating there is a demand for more blood/oxygen to digest food.\u00a0\u00a0So your system is working a little harder as it should.I'm not sure about any connection with eyesight, but high blood pressure can effect the small vessels in the eye (retina).\u00a0\u00a0Zestril is an ace inhibitor that helps relax the vessels and reduce the associated pressure.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to see a doctor for a medical checkup...there is a probability diabetes may explain your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your question, and if you have any followup questions you are welcome to ask. Take care.",
