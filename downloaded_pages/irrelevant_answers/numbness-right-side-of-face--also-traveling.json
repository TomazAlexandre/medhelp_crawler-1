            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0Common cold, sinusitis, ear infection, sensory nerve compression, peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes, inflamed wisdom tooth, impacted wisdom tooth, dental caries, etc\u00a0\u00a0can all cause facial numbness and pain. They can also cause ear numbness that spreads to face. If you also have a sore throat with swollen glands these possibilities should be looked into.Hemi facial numbness is also seen in Bell\u2019s palsy, trigeminal neuralgia where a spasm may cause numbness, or due to acoustic neuroma which is a benign tumor of the eighth cranial nerve.Other possibilities are mini stroke or transient ischemic attack, compression of spinal nerves, vitamin D deficiency, anemia, vaso-vagal attack anemia, lupus and other autoimmune disorders, heavy metal poisoning, multiple sclerosis, hypothyroidism, and panic attack. It can also be a type of seizure. If there is a headache then it can be benign intracranial hypertension too.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.

            "answer": "Thank you for replying, but please reread what I wrote. I have already been tested for vitamin deficiencies (I take D3 and B12 every day as well), hypothyroid, liver and kidney issues. All normal. I went to the dentist recently who saw no issues other than evidence I clench my jaw. No sinus issues. My blood pressure is very good, and I do not have diabetes. I am not feeling panicky.I have NO other symptoms, so not consistent with lupus, fibromyalgia, Bell's Palsy (no drooping), noI had an MRI 2 weeks ago which was clear.I have no facial pain -- just persistent numbness, and occasional tingling around the jaw/lower part of my right cheek if I bend my head in certain ways or, sometimes, when I start walking after sitting or when there is a marked temperature change.Maybe I am asking for the impossible, but so far, my doctors are stumped, and I was hoping for other ideas for testing.Thank you!",

    "question": "I have had numbness across most of the right side of my face up through my scalp and out to my ear for 2 months now. Occasionally, the numbness turns up elsewhere: in my right shoulder, today, for the first time, in the right side of my neck and my thigh. I am also getting especial tingling and occasional spasms around my jaw. I have no other symptoms. MRI last week negative, electrolytes fine, no B12 deficiency, kidney and liver function normal, blood pressure fine, do diabetes, no thyroid problems (all recent tests). Neurologist said its not a motor neuron disease or Bell's Palsy. Also don't have any pain, so Neuro doesn't think this is trigeminal neuralgia, and that would explain the occasional traveling paresthesia. I eat a mostly vegan diet with some seafood, very little sugar or processed foods, and salt intake under the RDA. I do drink coffee in the morning but no other caffeine.I did have two very short lived bugs this last winter -- about 36 hours of fever and general malaise, but nothing major. they occurred within two months of each other. The doctors are scratching their heads since my symptoms don't seem to fit anything they know of, and the neurologist is chalking everything up to stress with some possible TMJ thrown in (dentist did say I clench my jaw but that TMJ couldn't be causing all of this).I should mention also that I have just come out of an acute bout of depression and anxiety (I have suffered from depression my whole life), and am on Lyrica, Celexa (generic), Acyclovir 400mg and Klonopin (1/2 mg 2x a day to control the jaw spasms). I take niacinimide, vitamin D, B12 and Magnesium. I have PKD which is, so far, asymptomatic (so I don't take calcium anymore) , am slim, don't smoke or drink.This is driving me crazy. I don't know how to advocate for myself with the doctors for further exploration/testing to locate the cause of this. While i am willing to accept anxiety may have some role in this, I genuinely don't believe it is the cause. Please, if anyone has any ideas, I am getting desperate.",
