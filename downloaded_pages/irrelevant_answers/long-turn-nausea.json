            "answer": "HiHere are a few lines from a similar post on Med Help: \u201cThere are several possible explanations for your nausea (that I assume is not associated with vomiting). Your post nasal drip and sinus condition could be the cause of your problem. Gastrointestinal causes to be excluded include esophageal reflux, gastric inflammation and delayed gastric emptying. This last condition can be related to a number of illnesses including diabetes, hypothyroidism, and abnormalities of gastrointestinal muscles or nerves.I suggest that you see an ear, nose and throat specialist. Necessary gastrointestinal tests include an endoscopy (to visualize the lining of the esophagus stomach and duodenum) and a gastric emptying study.\u201d Refer:http://www.medhelp.org/forums/gastro/archive/775.htmlThe esophageal reflux and gastric inflammation has been ruled out in your case. Your blood sugar was high and maybe diabetes is the culprit. Diabetes also makes you feel very tired. Hypothyroidism should also be ruled out.Another cause that I can think of is hiatal hernia where the stomach protrudes into the chest cavity.Please discuss your case with your doctor. Since there are many medical problems, a clinical judgment is required. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted.",

    "question": "I am 23 years old and rarely get sick in any other way other then what I am about to describe. I play netball twice a week, am reasonably fit, I'm not over weight or under and I work full time.The nausea started a few years back. It was a constant nagging feeling that after a while I just learnt to live with. However, about a year and a half ago I started getting stomach pains also. I went to the doctor and he tired several different ulcer medications but non of this worked. The nausea at this stage was becoming unbearable and I was having to take a lot of time off work. This is when the fainting spells begun. Early in the morning I would become extremely faint and very nauseous I would have to sit down before I fell down. I had blood tests and an endoscopy but all the results were fine other then a slight iron deficiency.After months of going back and forth to the doctor I got frustrated and gave up instead turning my focus and money elsewhere. At the beginning of this year I had a few months relief from it all and I thought it was over.A few months ago it started up again with the fainting spells. One scary incident was while I was driving. Fortunately it was very fast so I didn't cause any accidents. Now the nausea is back and I am constantly fatigued despite getting 8 hours sleep every night. At the same time I started seeing halo's around objects when outside during the day. The latest doctor suggested Vasovagal and sent me for another blood test. This time my glucose was slightly higher then it should be. He's sending me for a fasting one tomorrow.I can't help but feeling I'm getting the run around. No one seems to know whats wrong and they are just trying everything they can think of. I'm not an endless pool of money. It's frustrating.If anyone has had anything similar and it has been diagnosed please let me know so I can do a little research off my own.Thank you",
