            "answer": "I had pre-diabetes before starting treatment, which has somewhat worsened during and since, but they believe the progression was inevitable whether with or without tx for the hcv.\u00a0\u00a0The main thing is to keep monitoring your blood sugar (get a glucose meter if you don't have one) and take whatever meds your doctor prescribes.Actually, during tx I kind of ignored my blood sugar as my treatment time was brief (I was genotype 2) and I had such trouble eating anything at all that if it went down easily, i ate it.\u00a0\u00a0That pretty much meant a lot of ice cream.In any event, high blood sugar is something you will eventually need to deal with as it's usually not a temporary thing.\u00a0\u00a0At some point you'd do best to see an endocrinologist, but now may not be that time.\u00a0\u00a0But in my opinion, you can go ahead on the 28th despite the glucose problem.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and good health.",
