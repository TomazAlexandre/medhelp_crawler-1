            "answer": "I have a bowl of porridge every morning. I put 4 dessert spoons (slightly rounded) in a bowl and add 1 teacup of water. A few grains of salt. Put in microwave at medium setting for 2 minutes, remove, stir and microwave for one more minute. If the microwave power is too high, it may boil over.
