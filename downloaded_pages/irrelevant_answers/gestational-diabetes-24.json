            "answer": "im a ftm and got diagnosed with it recently too. definitely have all the same questions as you. i had originally been seeing a midwife and now i have to have shared care with an ob to monitor myself and baby alittle more closely. just had my first appointment with my ob yesterday, i was so nervous to meet her because i was scared of not liking her or her being too pushy about interventions in my pregnancy like being induced or having a c section. but she was very reassuring. if your GD is well controlled on diet and exercise alone and baby is healthy and a normal size she will discharge me back to my midwives for delivery if i go into labour on my own before 40 weeks. if the GD has to be controlled by insulin your higher risk so she will be incharge of my care but being induced is dependent on babies health and size. if things dont look good then they will induce at 38 wks or if everything is fine they still wont let you go past your due date. so they'll induce then. a c section is more likely if the GD is uncontrolled and baby gets too big and they dont believe a vaginal delivery is safe. ive been able to control mine with diet alone so far so im hopefully gonna go naturally at some point btw 38 and 40 wks. :) sorry i can't give you any first hand advice but i think its different for everyone anyway.",

            "answer": "Hey ladies I had gestational diabetes with my second baby and I carried to full term. I did have to watch what I ate and during my pregnancy I did loose 25 pounds which my docter said was normal.just a word of advice it is important to take care of yourself while having the gestational diabetes because if you don't your baby can put on a lot of weight and you will have to start taking shots. Ya you can eat junk food every once in a great while but don't try to make it a regular thing even if your craving it. I know a few people who didn't care what the diettion said and they had a 12 pound baby. I don't want to worry anyone I'm just stateing that it is important to take care of yourself while have gestational diabetes. Good luck",

            "answer": "I was diagnosticed with gd at 28 weeks i did diet and exercise to control my sugar they asked me to check my sugar 4 times a day. They send me to the high risk clinic and i stared to have an appointment and sonogram each week. The first thing my ob told me was that because i had gd i will get induced at 39 weeks if my baby was not born by that day. I was induced on nov 7 and have an awesome boy. They checked his sugar each time he eats they pin his ankle and my jeart broke each time :-( thanks good his sugar was good and he is a healthy boy :-) as long as you go with your dr suggestions and you do your diet and exercise everything will be good it is hard but it is worth :-) i live in kansas not sure if it is different in other parts",

Where do you live? I was also having problems with high sugar when i wake up so they give me a medicine to take at night and that solve the problem",
