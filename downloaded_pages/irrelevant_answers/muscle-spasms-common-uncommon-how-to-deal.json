    "question": "I have been experiencing what I decribe as severe muscle spasms or cramps. Usually from the back area to the sides, they are happening more often now than when they first started almost a year ago.\u00a0\u00a0The other day it was so bad I had to pull the car over & get out to stretch, this seems to be the only relief I get.\u00a0\u00a0I was not sure if the pains I was feeling were related to Type II Diabetes or not. I heard that lack of potassium can cause the cramping.\u00a0\u00a0Now I read that it could be lack of magnesium?\u00a0\u00a0I don't now what to do, I am standing on line in a store to purchase something & I have to walk out because the pain is so bad and I get embarrassed people look at you writhing in pain.Please anyone any suggestions????",
