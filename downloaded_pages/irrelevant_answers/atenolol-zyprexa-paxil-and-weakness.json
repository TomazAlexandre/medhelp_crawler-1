            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You need to take him to his doctor and get all the drugs dose and timing adjusted. Also he needs to get his blood pressure and pulse rate recorded. In all probability, the BP is falling pretty low. Anemia, depression, hypothyroidism and diabetes could be the other causes.Take care!",

            "answer": "Hi! Thank you guys so much!!! The odd part about it is that his bp will occasionally be high, the other night it was 148/98. He does have PAC's which is why he was on the Atenolol to begin with. He's had EKG's and a nuclear stress test done, all normal...this is very frustrating and scary!!!",

    "question": "My fiancee currently takes 5 mg Zyprexa at night, 20 mg Paxil daily and 50 mg of Atenolol twice daily. He also has sleeping problems. Lately he has been experiencing extreme weakness and we are very concerned. Don't know if it's the sleep loss or the Atenolol as he did have a cardiologist tell him that his dosing of Atenolol daily was quite high. Any insight would be wonderful!!",
