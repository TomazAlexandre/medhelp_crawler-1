            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!One possibility is that hypothyroidism is not under control. The asthma medications can also cause similar symptoms. Hence talk to your doctor regarding that. It can also be due to poor sleep patterns, sleep apnea etc and hence sleep studies should be done. Another possibility is benign intracranial hypertension. This happens due to impaired CSF absorption. A generalized throbbing headache worst felt in the morning and last thing at night. This headache is generally relieved on standing (consistent with raised intracranial pressure). It is aggravated by straining, coughing or a change in position.It is accompanied by visual symptoms. You need a prompt evaluation by a neurologist. Hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, adrenal insufficiency are a few things I would recommend you get investigated for. These can precipitate BIH. A spinal tap is a must both to diagnose the condition and to treat it.\u00a0\u00a0It could also be an aura of migraines causing eye symptoms. Diabetes and polycystic ovary are two other conditions that should be looked for. Please discuss these possibilities with your doctor.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
