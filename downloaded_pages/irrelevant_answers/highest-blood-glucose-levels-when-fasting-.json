            "answer": "Ok, a couple things: 120-180 during the day is not good as you say; anything over 140 can lead to complications. Second if your husband was improving for a few months and lost a lot of weight (and is 31) he needs to check and make sure he actually IS Type 2 and not LADA/1.5 which is an entirely different type of diabetes. He needs to as his doctor to do Antibody and C-Peptide tests. About 20% of Type 2's are misdiagnosed (I was). Finally, morning fasting should be under 100 preferably. His higher morning numbers may be from something called Dawn Phenomena. Please read about it and perhaps join some forums with more traffic where many diabetics might have more advice on handling DP. (I don't have it).Zoe",

            "answer": "My 2 cents worth on diets; What your husbands must do is follow diabetes nutritional guidelines, aka proper nutrition. Proper nutrition means to accentuate the positive when it comes to food. I dislike the word diet. \u201cDiet\u201d implies a rigorous, self-sacrificial discipline that\u2019s doomed to fail. Instead, focus on achieving food goals of what you should eat each day rather than what you shouldn\u2019t eat. When you consume more vegetables, healthy fats [such as olive oil and nuts], lean proteins, fruits combined with low carbohydrate, low calorie, low starchy foods, your hunger will be satisfied and you will naturally want to make better choices. Another thing, diet's cause rapid weight loss, proper nutrition does not yet a person can achieve proper body weight. Here are links on diabetes nutrition guidelines http://tinyurl.com/nutrition-guidelines .Here's a quick check you husband can perform for Dawn Phenomena [DP]. Have your husband test just before bedtime, the morning results should not be higher than the bedtime results and below 99 mg/dl. Do this several nights in a row, and no cheating with late night snacks or colored liquids. If the results are positive ask to be referred to an Endocrinologist, a specialist with diabetes care and treatment. Ask him/her for the C-Peptide test as Zoe suggested along with a thyroid [TSH test] checked. Abnormal thyroids can and will disrupt blood glucose levels.Lastly, along with morning fasting testing it is important to know when to test [prandial & postprandial], especially with strenuous exercise. Post back if unsure and we can provide the times.",

            "answer": "\"He's on Amarel 2mg in the morning , and Metformin 500mg after lunch , and i think he's doin quite well with him.\"It is Amaryl aka Glimpiride not Amrel. It is important when quoting medicine to be exact with spelling. According to your 1st post he isn't doing well but you now say he is. Contradictory and confusing.\"What is LADA ?\"Latent Autoimmune Disease in Adults. See this link http://www.diabetesmonitor.com/lada.htm\"im note sure i understand about the different timings he should measure in the morning ? parndial & postprandial? \"OK, I hope this clears up the confusion and provides you with a meaningful understanding. Prandial means before meals. Postprandial means 2-3 hours after meals. These are two of the four [actually 8 if he eats 3 meals a day] test times, fasting the 1st and bedtime the last. The latter to measure against the morning fasting level. The prandial test provides a baseline measurement. Think of it as this where I should be 2-3 hours after my meal. The postprandial provides an insight of which foods are causing blood glucose to rise above normal. Blood glucose reaches its peak from foods eaten between 2 and 3 hours after consumption. Both prandial & postprandial ranges should be discussed with his doctor. Some doctors expect postprandial below <180 mg/dl, others at below <140 mg/dl.\"he was able to keep his BGL between 90 and 160 for a few months \"As you can see from the aforementioned information, this statement doesn't tell us much. I also suggest you ask his doctor for a referral to a diabetes nutritionist, not just an ordinary nutritionist, but one that has diabetes knowledge to help educate you and your husband on proper \"diabetes\" nutrition. Or, you can call a major teaching university hospitals nearest to you as that's where they normally practice.Hopes this helps answer your concerns.",

    "question": "This is the first time i posta question and im desperate for some answers!! My husband is 31 years old , and has been diagnosed with TYPE 2 Diabetes 6 months ago. Its been a rollercoaster..we changed our lifestyle and everthing was improving immensely the first 3 months. But then beacause of diet, excersice and medication he lost alot of weight , and he wasnt overweight to start of ...so he got frustrated and reduced the sports , quit medication . After 1 month of rebel he developed numbness in his right foot. Now he's worried again , and back to exercise and medication. His blood glucose level at the moment ranges from 120 to 180 during the day which i think is good..BUT my concern is about the morning fasting reading which is always around 145 and i know it shouldnt exceed 125. Why is the highest reading the fatsing one , when he had a light dinner the night before and obviously hasnt eaten all night ? Please help..im so confused and worried about any future complications.",
