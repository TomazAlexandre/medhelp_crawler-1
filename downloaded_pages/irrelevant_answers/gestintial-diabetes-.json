            "answer": "I have gestational diabetes, and it was very unexpected since I am 24 and not overweight and no family history of diabetes. I was shocked. If it comes back positive, you get a meter and check your blood sugar 4 times a day and try to control it with diet. If that doesn't work (which is my case ugh) then they will start you on insulin. It is very scary but it goes away after your baby is born and it's a pain in the butt. But you get another ultrasound to see the growth of the baby so they can monitor it. They will not induce or do a c section any earlier than 39 weeks. But if it's controlled and the baby isn't getting too big you should have no problem carrying baby for the full 40 weeks. :)",
