            "answer": "Since you waited so long (No hate here, I understand! I don't agree, but I understand!) it's possible that whatever damage occurred has healed incorrectly, which could be what's causing the continued discomfort.Are you able to flex and extend your hand normally, or is there limited range of motion in that joint?I'm glad you're going to get it looked at. Hopefully it can be fixed!",

    "question": "5 months ago, I was helping my dad with the car. Not knowing the vehicle was behind me, I swung my hang back and punched the car. I punch the middle finger, Hand knuckle. (The ones you see when you make a fist) Anyways, It was horrible pain... I had limited movement and it hurt to make a fist or touch it. But heres the catch, I did'nt go get an xray or anything when it happend. Please dont give me any hate... I didnt want to get surgery because i'm a cheerleader and i didnt want to be out of cheer, so I waited. So now its 5 months after this happend and my knuckle still hurts. I have a nasty. huge bruise where the knuckle was hit. My mother was describing what the knuckle looks like over the phone to my doctor. He thinks its broken and needs surgery... I'm getting an appointment in a week. I just want to see what anyone thinks... please comment!!Thank you,",
