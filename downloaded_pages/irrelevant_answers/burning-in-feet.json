            "answer": "Your job sounds hard on your condition.\u00a0\u00a0With your legs hanging down like that for extended periods, exp if you have neuropathy (numbness) it seems it could only get worse.\u00a0\u00a0I have similar numbness from just lying down!\u00a0\u00a0Get a new doctor if he/she doesn't have any good ideas to help you out.\u00a0\u00a0Just throwing more medicine, esp narcotics when you have bus driving responsibilities, is a grossly negligent approach.\u00a0\u00a0That's just my opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Something has to give. Either some viable non-narcotic treatment or another job.\u00a0\u00a0But you already know that. I understand how the Oxy could help. I am one of those that endorses the idea that there is no need to put up with pain.\u00a0\u00a0However, you should be able to have physical therapy prescribed for you to see if that helps.\u00a0\u00a0You may even be able to request a different job or different arrangements to accommodate your growing disability.\u00a0\u00a0I'm surprised your doc isn't helping with that.\u00a0\u00a0I'd be tempted to learn what your options are now for going on disability either through the school, a private policy you might have or through Social Security.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure you're not ready to be crippled so you need to take measures to care for your precious health.\u00a0\u00a0I can't tell you enough how important that is.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sorry I don't have any other diagnosis or treatment ideas.\u00a0\u00a0Keep looking. And, good luck!",

            "answer": "Thanks for the advice. Going on disability has been something I've considered, but not sure I can qualify for. I do have some therapy through my chiropractor, but that only helps my lower back, not really my feet. I have been doing some research but there really isn't anything out there I can find that really gives me any definitive help. Yeah, I have neuropathy, but can't determine what is causing it. I did have a doppler done on my swollen leg, but no clogged or collapse veins. Dr. recommended a seeing a foot doctor but I really can't see how he can help. Yeah, the pain is in my foot, but it doesn't start in my foot. The last podiatrist I saw was a joke, so I don't want to go back, but I am considering finding another one - just in case. Thanks again!",

            "answer": "Have you been tested for small fiber neuropathy? The symptoms of your feet sound very much like the symptoms i have, had skin biopsy done. They found that I have small fiber neuropathy. Something to consider.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with FM about 10 years ago, though I knew I had it quite a few years before that. I've been doing pretty reasonable, considering, with pain medication and exercise. About 1 1/2 years ago, I started with a tingling in my feet, like they fell asleep and I couldn't \"wake\" them up. Over the months it steadily got worse. They never stop tingling and sometimes the pain is so bad I have to take OxyC with flexeril to give me some relief. The burning in the balls of my feet have been getting even worse, though. My doctor doesn't seem to be concerned, but the pain is getting worse. I sit for my job (school bus driver) and of course, it's much worse after sitting! I don't have diabetes, though I am considered pre-diabetes. That has only been very recently though. Lately my left foot has started swelling and it doesn't go down at all. Any ideas? Any recommendations? Advice? Thanks!",
