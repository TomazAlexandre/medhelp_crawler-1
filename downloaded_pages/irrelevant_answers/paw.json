            "answer": "PAW (post acute withdrawal), covers many different symptoms like fatigue, depression, restless leg, body aches and many, many more. I had a few symptoms that lasted a few months. It is said that in some people, symptoms can last up to two years. What you were taking and how long you were taking it matters, but different people go through withdrawal differently. And not everyone experiences PAW. I was on opiates for almost 2 years about 10-20 pills a day and I still experienced severe restless leg and depression AFTER withdrawals. But there are people who have done much, much more for much longer and have experienced no PAW symptoms. It all is how your body reacts to what you were doing to it. Post Acute Withdrawal symptoms are definately real and no one really knows if you'll have any, what they will be, or how long they will last. But letting your doctor(s) know is a good thing. Most of these symptoms are very treatable. I was on Ambien for 3 months and have been on a low dose of Celexa ever since. And my symptoms are gone.So stay strong, stay informed and keep fighting the good fight.",

            "answer": "As soon as you can, get your blood sugar levels tested... I say this because type II Diabetes mimics MANY P.A.W. symptoms. Years of drinking actually caused damage to my pancreas CAUSING Type II diabetes. I had NO IDEA until my doc tested me a full 2 months after being completely sober (I was still having what I thought were withdrawl symptoms)...This can also happen in people taking large quantites of various drugs. All that stuff has got to go through your liver, and some ends up doing damage to other organs.",

            "answer": "Thanks for responding! Basically I was addicted to Vicodin Es\u00a0\u00a012-15 per day for the past year. I also was taking valium periodically. However, I started to ween off Vic's as per the doctor starting at 5 per day and then I decided myself to go to detox and get it over with. I went to detox july 23 and now today is day #25. Also, I do have chronic pain from fibromyalgia, however I do not want to take anything for it. I am actually trying to heal my mind, body, and spirit. I use essential oils, I see a therapist twice per week and acupuncture 2x per week. I spoke with the acupuncturist today and she said that I pushed myself to hard yesterday and my body was relapsing. My mind did not want Vicodin, however, my body did. I don't know all that I know is that it absolutely SUCKED. Oh yeah I forgot I went to get my naval pierced the day before and I had such a painful euphoric rush. I did it b/c its an incentive to work on my abs some more. Anyway, what do you guys think? Is it the trauma of my piercing or what? All that I know is that I never went through anything like that even in detox or when I came home. I have to bartend tomorrow and I am a little nervous. Any suggestions, its not that bad 11:30 - 6:00. Thanks, T",

    "question": "hi- I need help!!! I have been clean for 25 days and yesterday #24 was horrible. My body displayed every withdrawal symptom from the detox assessment. However, when I was in detox I only scored 3 or 4 on the symptoms. I was so scared because I did not feel right and everything was showing withdrawals. My cousin was with me and she was getting scared b/c I was not right I could'nt even walk I was so fatigued. Anyway, HAS ANYONE EXPERIENCED Post Acute Withdrawal? I went to the hosiptal and the doctor was amazing I told him everything. He gave me a Xanax .25mg and one to take home. What do I do? I feel lost, I really thought I was doing well and it hit me like a ton of bricks.I appreciate any insight, Please help.thanksTee",
