            "answer": "Wow. that's a lot of cider vinegar a week.I'd be concerned about the damage that this may be doing to your teeth (corrodes maliciously), your esophagus, and the sphincter valve at the top of your stomach, not to mention all that acid sitting in your stomach. It could also be doing your kidneys' damage.If you are drinking this in a therapeutic way, then you would be diluting this 20ml to 1L. Or at least, should be.I also hope you are at least consuming a natural product.Jeez, I would cut down on this.",

            "answer": "OK, differing answers! I drink it because I love the stuff and it is usually a seasonal treat but this year was a bumper crop of apples and there is lots of cider in the stores still! It does not cause me any gastroenterogical distress, actually the opposite, it seems soothing on the stomach and promotes regularity :) . I was more concerned about the natural sugars since it is quite sweet. Apple cider is a lot less processed than apple juice but it does contain a preservative. How is it on the liver? It's mainly pressed apple and apples are good aren't they? I really don't know.",

            "answer": "Eeeek 3 to 4 gallons a week,that can't be good.Let's just say to much of a good thing is not a good thing.One thing to know is that amount of sugar can lead to diabetes.From a few studies I've read say people with Hep C are more likely to have diabetes in comparison to the general population.The reason for that is yet still unknown.I had\u00a0\u00a0Hep C myself did a standard of care treatment that was available in 2012 for my genotype,now I'm still SVR.Wishing you the same.",

            "answer": "Cinnamon is good for counteracting high glucose levels which would be my concern about drinking so much apple anything. I hope you thoroughly clean your teeth afterwords too.If you don't like the taste of water try putting a slice of lemon or lime into your water.As far as your liver goes, if it's healthy the non-alcoholic cider should not be a problem. If not, I'd be concerned mostly about the preservatives.As always fresh and organic is the best way to go.Good luck.OH",
