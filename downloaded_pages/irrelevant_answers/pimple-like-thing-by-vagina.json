It's to the (if i'm looking down) it's to the left next to my... um heh pee pee. I mean I managed to nick it with my nail and squeezed it, just like a pimple and well puss started to seep out.(I'm sorry, disgusting but I need help since my mom doesn't get home for a while.) I'm 16 and worried, I mean I've had sex with my Boyfriend of over a year and I know he has no bad medical history, there is a very very far in the past history of sun cancer but he takes super precautions. My mom's side has diabetes but she doesn't have it.",
