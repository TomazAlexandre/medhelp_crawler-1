            "answer": "Hi,I am not quite sure what you mean.\u00a0\u00a0However, the insulin needles are very small and thin and really hurt far less than the finger pricks that we need for testing.These needles are bringing you health.\u00a0\u00a0They are preventing complications.As you learn more about management of your diabetes and see how you can control it you are going to be empowered.I would also recommend Dr Richard Bernstein's \"Diabetes University\" on U-Tube.\u00a0\u00a0His book Diabetes Solutions, is also excellent for learning about optimal blood sugar management, though it can be heavy going.\u00a0\u00a0He recommends very low carb, but even if you decide not to take that approach (though some extent of carb restriction is optimal for diabetes management)., there is still much excellent information to be gained.Other good books are Using Insulin by John Walsh, and \"Think Like a Pancreas\".Please come and ask more questions as you need.\u00a0\u00a0The first big step was getting diagnosed. Though there is surely a grieving and adjustment period, the great thing is that today we have the tools and knowledge to have excellent control, if we choose to learn and use them.",

            "answer": "First of all my symphaties! It is a beginning of a long journey. Life will be different, but definitely manageable. You still will be able to enjoy everything but learning a new routine with diabetes will be essential. It is very important to keep sugar levels under control, and for that (if you are type 1) insulin injections are crucial. I have been on insulin for 15 years, and the injections are my last worries. The needles are only few milli metres long and you should aim to inject into a fatty area e..g belly. Pull the fat together then inject. For the diet and what carbs to eat and when ( I eat 4-5 times a day and less) should be discussed with your doctor. You should also have your H1Abc checked at every 6 months at least (blood test). Good luck and life will get better you will see!",
