            "answer": "Dear eniko,To test for diabetes would be simple enough so it wouldn't hurt to ask her doctor. But you say she is gaining weight and usually with type 1 diabetics, they lose weight. Plus, you didn't mention increased urination, as this is also very typical. But good luck and remember i am not a doctor but just another diabetic, bret",

            "answer": "Thanks for the answer. I just got back from the pediatrician, who will test her urine, once I collected some, but really doesn`t think diabetes is the case, rather suspects that she is getting all her calories and sugar from juice and milk, that is why she developed poor eating habits. Well, I say the test will tell.Thanks again and good health to everyone!",
