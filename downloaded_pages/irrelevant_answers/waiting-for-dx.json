            "answer": "MS LP tests can't be done at just any lab. They often send them to several for comparison. Also it depends on the doctor's availability to explain the LP results. Mine took six weeks. Yes it does drive you crazy. Then the doctor did some more blood work and something pointed to Lupus so more testing. I finally turned out to be MS. From the time the first neurologist said it was MS it was two years and 6 neurologists to finally diagnose it. No test rules MS in or out. They go by something called the McDonald Criteria which looks like a neurologist wrote it it is so complex and vague.As far as the feet. I have all the issues you describe. Besides the medications and few more my pain is the same. I have had to learn to live with it. If you were to have relapsing Remitting MS which most people start with it could come and go. IV steroids and physical therapy are the only things else. You do not have to have a diagnosis to treat symptoms. I go to a pain clinic which is a God send. I swim a mile a day and walk even though it is painful. Distraction helps me. Hiking places, walking the dog.I can hardly walk and I am going to Europe for 3 1/2 weeks. I am hoping I am so excited I forget I hurt. I am taking crutches.I realized worry is trying to control the future and I can't. I am so relaxed about the trip. I have the house cleaned, I am packed, and have the pet sitters straight.Yesterday my cat had a blocked bladder from kidney stones. They can die if the bladder ruptures. I got him to the vet. He has to stay through the week end and we leave tomorrow. I saw him today. He has a catheter going to a bag of bloody urine. He has an IV and a plastic hat. He was happy to see me as I was him. I am relaxed because I know the vet and pet sitter will take care of him.\u00a0\u00a0Besides there is nothing more that I can do.I am surprised how relaxed I am. I was not calm during the MS saga. I drove myself and all those around me nuts. I had to go to counseling for five years. I can't believe I am the same person.Since I was diagnosed with MS very little has changed. I have a rarer form of MS and my symptoms stay. The difference is now I have something real. People in the medical profession do not roll their eyes as if to say here comes a hypochondriac.I hope you get your answers. A friend of mine went to New Zealand and everyone says no worries and smiles.Alex",

            "answer": "Thanks for your response and so happy for you.\u00a0\u00a0I have gone in and out of anxiety over this.\u00a0\u00a0I did get my LP results today, and all results were normal.\u00a0\u00a0So I don't know what to think.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor had someone else in the office give me the results so I could not ask questions.\u00a0\u00a0But I do have an appointment next week, so I can ask then.\u00a0\u00a0So, I guess the odds are good that it is not MS, but them from what I have read, it is not that clear cut. And I still don't know what is causing my sx.\u00a0\u00a0I am grateful for relatively mild sx by contrast to others.\u00a0\u00a0I know the road to a dx can be long, sometimes years.\u00a0\u00a0And I don't know if I would want any treatment at this point anyway, other than to mask the symptoms which I already have achieved with the Pamelor.\u00a0\u00a0So unless the pain gets worse, I will try to be patient and grateful.\u00a0\u00a0I have so much to be thankful for.",

Nortriptyline worked best for me.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry for any misunderstanding HVAC.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I have read McDonald criteria.\u00a0\u00a0I need another relapse to fit this I believe, so it's probably a waiting game.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully sx continue to improve and I never have an exacerbation.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again.",

            "answer": "I NF - Welcome to the group.Neuropathic foot pain is a movie I've seen :-) There is no 1:1 med to pain thing. The meds used to treat neuropathy are generally meant for another purpose. Most often they are either antidepressants (amitriptilyne) or anti-seizure meds (gabapentin, Lyrica).It can take a while to get the righ combination and dosage dialed in. But it is very doable :-)Kyle",

Just to give you some ideas on possible causes...\"Some neuropathies develop over years, while others can start and get severe within days.Nerve damage can be caused by:Autoimmune (when the body attacks itself) disordersConditions that put pressure on nervesDecreased blood flow to the nerveDiseases that destroy the glue (connective tissue) that holds cells and tissues togetherSwelling (inflammation) of the nervesSome diseases lead to polyneuropathy that is mainly sensory or mainly motor. Possible causes of sensorimotor polyneuropathy include:Alcoholic neuropathyCancer (called a paraneoplastic neuropathy)Chronic inflammatory neuropathyDiabetic neuropathyDrug-related neuropathyGuillain-Barre syndromeHereditary neuropathyVitamin deficiency (vitamins B12, B1, and E)\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000750.htmCheers.......JJ",

An LP doesn't rule out MS, only to back up a DX of MS.I personally had a clean LP (done twice) but have a DX of PPMS. I know several others that have various forms of MS (RRMS, SPMS, PPMS) that also have had clean LP results. If your doctor is ruling out MS based solely on the LP results I would look into getting a second opinion.Dennis",

    "question": "I started having pain in my feet 7 months ago. Started with the podiatrist who diagnosed worsening arthritis of big toes of both feet. Had three rounds of cortisone shots with limited improvement. Then a month later had burning in feet that moved up my legs. After ruling out usual suspects for neuropathy: diabetes, B12 deficiency etc., internist sent me for NCV test. The doc who performed the test found neuropathy in legs and recommended MRI of brain and cervical spine. Brain MRI showed lesions but my doc did not think this indicative of\u00a0\u00a0MS. She sent me for lumbar MRI. Nothing significant showed on that to explain foot problems. By now pain had been so bad I could hardly walk at times. Then it would ease up a bit. Numbness, paresthesias and fasciculations driving me mad. My podiatrist reluctantly prescribed hydrocodone which hardly touched the pain. I had been prescribed gabapentin which did little for the neuropathy. Then I was switched to nortriptyline which helped a lot. Other symptoms were urinary frequency, like every 15 mins at times and once the right side of my face got really hot all of a sudden. By summer neuropathy, paresthesias and fasciculations were still very troublesome. My doc sent me to a neuro who said MRI of brain indicated possible MS. He also noted asymmetric and abnormal deep tendon reflexes.\u00a0\u00a0MRI report noted sub cortical and peri ventricular lesions in both hemispheres. He sent me for a lumbar puncture. It's been a week, results are in but still waiting for doc to call with the results. I am going crazy waiting. If not MS, what could it be?",
