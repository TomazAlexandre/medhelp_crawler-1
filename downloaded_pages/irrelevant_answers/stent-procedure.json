            "answer": "For a perspective in about 25% of patients, the growth of scar tissue underneath the lining of the artery may be so thick that it can obstruct the blood flow and produce an important blockage. In-stent restenosis is typically seen 3 to 6 months after the procedure; after 12 months have passed uneventfully, it is rare. Individuals with diabetes are at increased risk for in-stent restenosis.What is next?\u00a0\u00a0The cardiologist may recommend diagnostic tests (for instance, an exercise stress test) to evaluate whether the patient is likely to have developed in-stent restenosis or another coronary artery is blocked. If in-stent restenosis is a possibility, the cardiologist may refer the patient for a repeat cardiac catheterization. In addition, local intravascular radiation (brachytherapy) can be used after treating in-stent restenosis with angioplasty to prevent reoccurrence. Brachytherapy uses a radioactive source that is delivered by a coronary artery catheter inside the narrowed artery for a short period of time (about 10 minutes). The source is removed and does not stay in the body. Because the short period of radiation inhibits long-term tissue growth in the treated vessel, it successfully prevents in-stent restenosis. That treatment may not be available as only a few centers have the special expertise needed to perform brachytherapyThere is a drug eluding balloon option.\u00a0\u00a0\"CHICAGO, Ill. (March 31, 2008) \u2014 An angioplasty balloon coated with a drug that reduces renarrowing of the coronary arteries appears to be more effective than a drug-eluting stent in treating an unwanted build-up of tissue inside a bare-metal coronary stent. After six months, the newly expanded artery remained more widely open within the stent after treatment with the paclitaxel-eluting balloon.",
