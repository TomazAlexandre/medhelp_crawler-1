            "answer": "As far as I remember from my lectures folliculitis is commonly caused by overgrowth of staphylococcus aureus bacteria which is present on the skin of alot of people. This is normally treated with flucloxacillin. I've not heard of erithromycin use for upper respiratory tract infection so I wouldn't like to speculate on why this could have caused folliculitis other than the two infections would have been very close together time-wise if they were related or linked to the antibiotic.",

            "answer": "Well that is just a guess based on the fact that antibiotic usage can lead to overgrowth of bacteria in other regions of the body that would normally be present along with many other species all fighting for space and nutrients and therefore limiting each other's growth. Kill some and it leaves space for others to proliferate but this would normally occur in a matter of days after antibiotic treatment.",
