    "question": "Hi everyone.As some may recall, I've been really feeling yucky.\u00a0\u00a0My husband finally convinced me to see the doctor yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0I'd been running a temperature since March 3, and some other disturbing symtoms very much reminding me of the diverticulitis, but that could also overlap with the ovarian/uterine issues I have right now.\u00a0\u00a0The primary care doc I see felt really bad about dropping the ball last year when I got so sick, so he's not messing around with me AT ALL.\u00a0\u00a0I'm back on Cipro and Flagyl and I'll have a CT scan on Monday.\u00a0\u00a0My white count was still below normal, but I normally run at about 7,000 when I'm healthy and it was up above 10,000.\u00a0\u00a0That's risen just in the last couple of weeks since it was just checked February 23.\u00a0\u00a0So, I've definitely got something cooking, again.\u00a0\u00a0The other alarming finding was ketones and protein in my urine.\u00a0\u00a0The doc felt that was probably more due to dehydration than anything else, but again, I've had some other indications of moving toward diabetes, so he checked my blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0It was okay, and I hadn't spilled any sugar into my urine either, but there was concern that my blood sugar was kinda low since it wasn't a fasting sample taken and I'd just eaten spaghetti for lunch right before I went in.\u00a0\u00a0The ketones also could be because of the low carb diet I'm on, so I'm not real worried about this.\u00a0\u00a0Good news is he shared my biopsy results with me even though I'll talk to the gyno tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0No cancer, no hyperplasia, just evidence of anovulation and a build up of endometrial material.\u00a0\u00a0Just like before.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway. . . later, Barb",
