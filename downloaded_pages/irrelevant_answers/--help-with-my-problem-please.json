            "answer": "Itching or burning is often caused by allergic sensitivity for which the cortisone would probably help, or infection such as bacteria or yeast.Okay, could you possibly be allergic to any of the soap you are using?Do you have any discharge from your vaginal area?Is there a sore and distinct smell?If there isn't any discharge or smell from that area, and the soap isn't any bother, you could possibly use any antifungals to see if that would possibly help.If that doesn't work, try checking if there is a history of diabetes in your family. In other words, get your blood tested for the glucose level.Also!Here are some tips to care for vaginal itching/burning/irritation.1. Keep your genital area clean and dry. Use plain, unscented soap.2. Avoid colored or perfumed toilet tissue and bubble bath.3. Wear cotton panties or pantyhose with a cotton crotch. Avoid panties made from synthetic materials. For infants and toddlers, change diapers often.4. Change out of wet clothing, especially wet bathing suits or exercise clothing, as soon as possible.5. Avoid feminine hygiene sprays and douches.6.
