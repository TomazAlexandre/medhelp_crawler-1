            "answer": "Yea, it's pretty late in the game for the test. It should be done by 28 weeks and if failed a repeat ASAP. That away they can monitor if you need insulin or not. At this point you will only have a few weeks left to know. A little weird if you ask me. They did stress to eat absolutely nothing. It could alter results.",

    "question": "I'm 36 weeks and they are redoing my gestational diabetes test because the last place that did it only had me wait an hour after drinking the sugar drink. It's only been 4 hours, and I usually eat at night but I am SO hungry my stomach is hurting and I don't think I can wait a whole 8 hours. I honestly didn't even think they were supposed to do the testing this late but they wanna make sure. Is there anything I can eat just a little snack like cheese or crackers or anything? I am seriously not gunna make it. I've been drinking lots of water and it's not helping",
