Prognosis will depend on the viable myocardium and co morbid conditions like diabetes.

            "answer": "TIMI-2 flow means that blood past the 99% blockage is sluggish. A timi score of 2 means an 8% chance of mortality, or another MI. As the distal part of your LAD is not filling retrograde, and is sluggish, I think it's safe to assume at the moment you have no collateral vessels which have opened. Personally I think the blockage of 99% requires stenting. I'm not sure about the 70%, this is borderline and is location at the top of the LAD, probably close to where the LCX branches off. If really close to the LCX branch, then stenting is much more difficult, but certainly not impossible, it depends on the experience of the cardiologist.",
