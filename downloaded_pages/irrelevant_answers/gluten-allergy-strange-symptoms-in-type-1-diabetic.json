    "question": "HI- I have a question regarding my daughter with type 1 diabetes-I have inquired with the endocronologist- but they do not recognize the symptoms-My daughter commonly complains of her legs hurting- sometimes so badly that she cannot sleep.It happens mostly at night- but sometimes during the day as well.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor said that it might be growing pains- ( I do not think so...- she has had this issue since she was a toddler... but it is getting worse and more frequent)- she also complains that her stomach hurts- also often at night.I am concerned that it might be food allergies- (celiac?) gluten?-Just wondering if anyone else has had issues such as these.-Desperately trying to find out what is causing her so much trouble- she has enough to deal with already!!!Thanks for your help-",
