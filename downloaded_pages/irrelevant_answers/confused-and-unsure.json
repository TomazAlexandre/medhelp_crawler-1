            "answer": "Hi.I understand what you are going through.From my understanding, your mother has early stage breast cancer, ER negative, Her2Neu overexpression, and node negative.Prognostic factors in breast cancer include the stage of the disease, lymph nodes status, hormone receptor status, Her2Neu status, presence or absence of lymphovascular involvement, presence or absence of proliferation indices (Ki-67 or MIB-1).Tamoxifen may not be beneficial in patients with negative hormone receptor status.\u00a0\u00a0Thus, there is a need to give systemic treatment in the form of chemotherapy to prevent or decrease the risk of recurrence.I would suggest that you and your oncologist to talk to your mother and possibly convince her to undergo systemic chemotherapy.\u00a0\u00a0You may seek consult with another oncologist for second opinion.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Thankyou for an easier to understand.... In fact thankyou simply for reading and spending the time to reply.By the way she has a Progestrone +...From other posters on this site, it would appear that patients get the biopsy report and also it is given to the patient,the system is different here.I am not sure about the proliferation Index. I will check this.We saw a second oncologist yesterday, and she has confirmed that chemo would be too hard for my mum, so the systematic approach using chemo is out.She has suggested Arimidex which has of course bone dentisty issues. Mum is not very comfortable with anything and she is still suffering from the Tamoxifen,,,\u00a0\u00a0In the next week I think she will be making some decision based on the Armidex optionI am curious about the FISH test, I believe they used ICH ?? to test for Her2, but I keep reading that it is not as accurate.. Do you think its worth getting this done ?Many thanksMal",

            "answer": "Hi.Breast cancer in the elderly should be treated in the same manner as that of young patients with breast cancer.\u00a0\u00a0But since most elderly patients have comorbid illnesses (diabetes, heart problem), the risks and benefits of treatment should be thoroughly discussed before initiating any forms of treatment.Hormonal therapy in the form of tamoxifen or arimidex may benefit patients who have ER-, PR+ status.You should have a copy of the pathology report and all laboratory results for reference.\u00a0\u00a0You can ask for it from your doctor or at the hospital records section.Her2 testing using IHC is acceptable if with +3 result.\u00a0\u00a0If the result is +1 or +2, there is a need to confirm this using FISH.\u00a0\u00a0Her2 testing is recommended since this is one of the prognostic factors in breast cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Also, the result of Her2 testing will determine which patient may benefit from targeted therapy in the form of trastuzumab (herceptin).",

    "question": "My mother is 69 and diabetic (type II insulin dependant). Takes Lipitor and Karvea (for BP).She was diagnosed (mamogram) with early breast cancer - november last year)Two tumours (14mm and 11 mm) were detected. Core biopsy was carried and both tumours were deemed cancerous.Mastectomy was carried out in jan 2008, 11 nodes removed all clear.The surgeon told us that the cancer was not ER positive, put her on Tamoxifin because he said that studies showed that there could be benefits for someone who is not ER +. Given her profile age and diabetes he recommended no chemo which he said is the normal case for some one who is ER -. He was going to present this treatment to the hospital committee.Mum could not cope with the side effects (hot flushes and sweating, headaches, tingling in her legs and burning feet ) so after 3 weeks on the course she stopped. The surgeon was away at thi s time.We got a letter from the surgeon a week and half ago, saying that treatment he had recommended as discussed had been accepted by the committee but there was an appointment made with a professor oncologist at the hospital. Mum could choose to go or not.Well, we did not know what to expect. The professor was not the most patient friendly. He hadn\u2019t read the file and nor was he aware that mum was on tamoxefin.He told us that the reason mum was referred to him was to discuss treatment for mums cancer which is HER2. He told us there were 3 options: do nothing, chemo (8 treatments over 5 months) and Herceptcin for 1 year, or arimidex .As we were not prepared we did not really know what to ask. He did say upon hearing she was on Tamoxifen and not coping that option 2 (chemo and herceptcin) would not be something mum could cope with. He never quite answered why she could not have targeted treatment using Hercepticin!\u00a0\u00a0Mum is not wanting to take anything at this time\u2026..I am scared for\u00a0\u00a0mum and do not fully comprehend despite trawling through many articles \u2026in fact what I read makes me even more scared for her\u2026 Any clarity would be appreciated.Thanks in advanceMal",
