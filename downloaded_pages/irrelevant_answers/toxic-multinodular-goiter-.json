            "answer": "Sounds like a toxic multionodular goiter (MNG)-- or Graves disease with the ultrasound being interpreted as multinodular rather than inflammation.\u00a0\u00a0The TSH is slightly low --- at age 41, most would observe and not treat unless the symptoms are prominent.No one should be \"forced\" to get RAI - it is simply one effective treatment option -- the other is surgery.\u00a0\u00a0If this is toxic MNG then antithyroid drugs would need to be used long-term and we prefer not to do this.\u00a0\u00a0If it is Graves (may help to get TSI, TBII and I-123 scan to distinguish MNG from Graves) then antithyroid drugs (tapazole or ptu) could put this in remission, but many Graves patients end up needing RAI or surgery in the end.",

    "question": "I am 41 years old and starting feeling tired recently and losing more hair than usual. I went to an endocrinologist and they found nodules in my thyroid. None are more than 1 cm.\u00a0\u00a0My initial blood results were .17 on TSH and my T4 level was normal.\u00a0\u00a0They just took my blood this week to check the T3 level.\u00a0\u00a0What do you anticipate will be my recommended treatment by my Dr.\u00a0\u00a0I am nervous and don't really like the Dr. and am considering going to another one.\u00a0\u00a0They said I have mild hyperthyroidism. Is is true that the nodules will continue to grow? Are most patients pretty much forced to get the radioactive iodine and how dangerous is this????",
