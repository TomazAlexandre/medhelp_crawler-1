            "answer": "i was having the same problems..i noticed that my urinations were gradually increasing to 20 times a day. i had all sorts of blood work done, kidney tests, diabetes, thyroid, liver...everything came out fine. i was loosely diagnosed with overactive bladder and i am on Detrol La, which i think has at least cut the number of times i go in half. i think that this condition is a result of two things: long term anti-depressant/anxiety medication and over use of caffeine(mainly soda). if i do not drink caffeinated soda, i do notice that i go less. it is still however a disruption of my daily life. i feel self-conscious when going somewhere in a car with friends, because i know i will have to stop to pee at least 3 times. not that they really care but it's annoying!",

            "answer": "I have been having similar symptoms. I'm a 20 year old female and I've never had frequency before. It all started back in May and I've been dealing with it as best I can for 4 months now. I'm so sick of it... the problem started while on a car trip (which was terrible timing, let me tell you). I had to stop every 15 min. to pee. My parents are tired of driving anywhere with me because I have to stop so often. I've been put on oxybutynin, which didn't work for me at all, then Detrol LA, which relieves the constant 'gotta go' symptoms somewhat. Urinary Tract Infection has been ruled out (several times I might add) and diabetes. You know, the usual things they check you for. I'm just wishing someone could give me a straight answer as to what's going on. My gyno-urologist gave me an antibiotic for inflamation, which worked for a while but I wasn't able to finish it (horrid side effects- stomach upset, nausia) so now I'm back to square one. Doctor wants me to do one of those 24 hour urine diaries. Hoping to find some relief soon.",

    "question": "I am a 32 year old female. I am pretty healthy. However, about a month and a half ago, I started having very severe urinary frequency and urgency. I had no pain or burning during urination. However, I tested positive for a urinary tract infection and began on pyridium and bactrim. My symptoms did not improve so I began on Levaquin for 10 days. Since then I have had an ultrasound of my kidneys, ovaries, and bladder, and everything was normal. My labwork was also normal. My symptoms did not improve and I began on Vesicare, which did not help, and now I am on Detrol LA. This does not seem to be helping either. I am continuing to urinate 20-30 times a day. Sitting also makes it worse. Please help. I cannot continue to live like this.This discussion is related to/posts/show/912656.",
