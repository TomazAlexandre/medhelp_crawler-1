            "answer": "It is always hard to know when perimenopause starts as the symptoms can be due to that and other things as well. The best bet is to see your doctor. Have a blood test for FSH (follicle stimulating hormone). If it is elevated, that is a sign it is perimenopause. You might also ask to be checked for diabetes and thyroid diesease. These are also common and can cause some of your symptoms. The test for diabetes is a fasting blood sugar or a test that measures your blood level fasting and then several times after drinking a sugar liquid the doctor provides. An HgA1C blood test is also sometimes used as a screen. TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) and T4 are good blood tests for screening thyroid disease. If all of that is normal, then you should discuss possible infections that can cause night sweats.Best of luck.Machelle Seibel, MD",

    "question": "Hi I am a 39 yr old woman with 3 children. I am about 75lbs overweight, unfortunately always have been. Recently, Ive been having some strange symptoms for my age, and Im wondering if this could be the start of perimenopause. My main symptom is night sweats, almost every night. They are not horrible, but I do wake up sweaty, and hot. I remember having this problem when I was in my mid twenties before I had children, but havent experienced it since. My mom was in her early 50's when she went through menopause.I am still having very regular periods, every 28-30 days, lasting 4-5 days. This month however it was 2 days early, that almost never happens. In addition I suffer from \"visual\" migraines, meaning I get the aura, but never the headache. At the start of my period this month, until 3 days after I got a vascular migraine (throbbing pain), no aura. I do suffer from sleep apnea as well. Im wondering since my periods are still regular if this is really perimenopause, or something else? Any input is appreciated..",
