            "answer": "Don't be so hard on yourself. Anyone can get gestational diabetes regardless of how well they eat and exercise. Its hard for a woman's body to handle pregnancy and the other stuff is not your fault. Hang in there, keep your head up and it will all work out.",

The only other time I went through exteeme stress was when I was 15 and my dad died of cancer. But back then I handled stress through cutting but that was years and the years ago.",

            "answer": "You did not give yourself gd. It can happen whether you eat well or not. Some women are just more genetically prone to it. I'm sorry your son is being difficult right now, but it is NOT because you're a bad mom. He is testing you. Stick to your guns, and do what you say you will, and it will pass. Take heart. Surround yourself with supportive people, and I wish you all the best.",

Praise all good behavior and don't react to negative behavior.\u00a0\u00a0Using a simple tone to make him understand he has been bad should work better than getting upset. The 2 year old knows you are pregnant and feels your anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0Take advantage now of only having one and gain control now while you still can",

I stay calm with her and she know when we say the word \"naughty\" (we call it the \"n\" word in our house) she did something wrong. But she'll just keep doung it. Its only whem daddy calls her \"naughty\" that she'll stop. Its just stress on top of stress.",

            "answer": "The first post is correct. It has nothing to do with \"sugar\" literally. You can get gestational diabetes no matter how health you are. I am in the same boast as you with a two year old. I don't work and my bf just got hit with double child support unexpectedly his check went from 800 to 160. I'm still finding a way to stay happy. Life isn't easy,\u00a0\u00a0but it's worth living. I just graduated college I'm having a new baby its just a matter of time before things start looking up. I think you may be a bit depressed. I'd try talking to a counselor. I hope you feel better soon xoxo",

I watched another girl at my work who was pregnant at the same time come in with hoards of junk food every day. It was hard then, but I promise when it's all over it won't seem like a big deal. Just do the best you can,and please do not blame yourself.",

I know it was from my excessive soda intake. I drank lots of ginger ale and sprite to help with the morning sickness I still have. And to top off everything I have a 2 year old that has truly hit the terrible twos. I feel like such a failure and just find myself crying and feeling like sh*t constantly.",
