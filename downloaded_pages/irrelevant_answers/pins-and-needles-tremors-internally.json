            "answer": "Hi,How are you?Some of your symptoms like tightening around the neck, ear, and gum pressure could have been due to dental abscess. However it is very unlikely that tingling numbness in the feet is due to dental abscess.I would suggest you to get your blood sugar levels checked to rule out diabetes. Nerve compression and peripheral vascular disease also cannot be ruled out.Please discuss these possibilities with your treating doctor. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi, In August 2007 I started experiencing pins and needles in my fingers and toes. Soon after I had internatal vibrations (head and arms), tightening around neck area, ear and gum pressure and some vision problems. I have had a clear MRI and all blood work came back ok apart from B12 level of 120 and low calcium and vitamin d level, but after taking suppliments these levels rectified themselves. Therefore my doctor has ruled out vitamin deficiencies and the neurologist also seems think there is nothing seriously wrong. I still have these symptoms and not knowing what causes them is a horrible feeling.\u00a0\u00a0I had a filling in my tooth 1 week before this all started and also got a abscess on this particular tooth last month and wonder if this may have anything to do with the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I would be very greatful if anybody could help.AileenxxReported Report this SpamMiscategorized",
