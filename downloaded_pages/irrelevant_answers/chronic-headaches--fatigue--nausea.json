            "answer": "mmmm... you've probably tried this (i'm just firing off a guess..) but I know celiac's usually develop other problems like food intolerances to soy/lactose/fructose/sucrose whatever (you name it..) maybe he could try going on a more strict elimination diet to see if he's now developed a new food intolerance problems...also you didn't mention IBS at all...but if he's having problems you could check out his thyroid..it also has a wide range of symptoms that can go out of wack.. one of the big ones is fatigue which also can cause constipation and nausea..i'm debating testing myself again.. at least look closely into hypothyroidism and ask your doctor if there's a chance about that (esp. if there's any family history)Nausea is *usually* some motility problem of food..not always but that's the usual suspect so maybe some fiber..more water...maybe a blood test checking for vitamins..sometimes people chronically low in potassium for example develop nausea.Just some ideas :S good luck it's not fun being nauseated 24/7 (I know.. dealing with it myself..)",

    "question": "My husband, 63 years old, has Celiac Sprue, Type 1 late onset diabetes, and arthritis. Beginning with the diagnosis of Celiac about 8 years ago, he has had a multitude of unexplained health problems. The highlights are: 2 sinus surgeries and was hospitalized after losing consciousness last fall. Many tests were run--all negative. For the past three years he has lived with severe headaches, which were thought to be sinus related, but apparently not because they did not clear up with the sinus surgeries. Now the theory is that his sinuses are inflamed not infected. The headaches have gotten much worse, nausea, and fatigue are incapacitating. Recently, after another sinus infection and a course of Avalox he developed thrush, took 3 diflucon to treat it, but continues to feel nauseous every day. Headaches range between 3-7 in pain--Nausea at about 2-5 daily. Does anyone have any ideas of what this could be? My husband is a disciplined man who takes care of his diabetes with insulin and keeps himself on a gluten free diet.This discussion is related to/posts/show/233151.",
