I've been taking four mil a day for well over 13 years.When I changed internist, my new physician gave me a prescription for 2 mil to last me 10 days. I am almost out.Here is my concern...I have the following symptoms.Headache - pain and pressure on the base of the skull and neckPressure and pain in my neckMy head jerks uncontrollablyDizzinessIcy/numbness in back of neck, shoulders, upper back, upper arms and chestShaking in handsDisorientationRestless Leg SyndromeNauseaClouded visionSlurred SpeechUnable to concentrateThose are just a few of the symptoms I have been having for a year. My Doctor believes that I have a brain tumor or possibly MS.I'm a 38 yr old female, with type 2 Diabetes and hypothyroidism.Could my symptoms be caused from long term klonopin use????I had NO idea that its addictive! I am worried about things when I run out!!!",
