            "answer": "Yes, if a person is diagnosed with one autoimmune disease, others tend to show up more often than in the healthy population. So your son's doctor's idea about the hepatitis does make sense. I found a good website with lots of info about this kind of hepatitis:ttp://www.diabetesmonitor.com/b386.htmIf this is indeed the diagnosis and your son is started on prednisone, do read up on the long-term side effects of prednisone. My twin was put on prednisone when her adrenal glands stopped producing cortisone for a period of time because of the autoimmune issues that caused both of us to become type 1 diabetics. At some point, her adrenal glands started working again, although spottily, and she was taken off of prednisone. But the weaning off of this drug takes a long time, and there are withdrawal symptoms for months after removing the drug. Very bad side effects, too, in my sister's case. So do discuss this medication and any other options fully before agreeing to treatment with prednisone. Best to be fully aware of all possible side effects. In my twin's case, the prednisone altered her digestive tract's chemical balance so that she has stomach problems now. But it can be a miracle drug when it is needed.",

            "answer": "How is your overall weight? It sounds as if you may be dealing with some insulin resistant issues since you are taking oral meds. If you are even slightly heavier than you should be, losing weight might help you a lot, and this might help relieve stress on the heart, too. We volunteers are not doctors, so can only give suggestions from what we know from personal experience or from our own reading, so I would suggest that you go back to your doctor and insist that he help you lower those glucose levels. Our doctors\u00a0\u00a0need to know that we are not satisfied with poor glucose control -- if we tell them we are not satisfied, they will often make adjustments.",

    "question": "Hello- I have a 16 year old son with type 1 diabetes. He was diagnosed at age 6.\u00a0\u00a0What we found in our years of him growing.. there was plenty of times that his blood sugars would seem to be in control and other times we felt like we were on a rollercoaster. One thing is certain, when children are going through a growth spurt, the growth hormone can suppress the effectiveness of the insulin. Therefore, we noticed during peaks of growth that we would have to increase the insulin required for a length of time and then decrease it once the growth spurt was over. My son was prescribed metformin on top of his insulin regime to try to reduce the extreme amounts of NPH he was taking. He took the metformin for about 3 years and recently discontinued it in Oct 2007 because he has been diagnosed with compensated cirrhosis of the liver. And now that I have done tons of research, I have found that certain liver diseases can also cause insulin resistance. So, now I wonder.. during the times of my son's life when his insulin needs increased dramatically... were those times of liver inflammation? We haven't found the cause of the cirrhosis because there is no active inflammation. We've done a bone marrow biopsy first because my son was extremely anemic and it turned out that his marrow was somewhat iron depleted. He has an enlarged spleen, portal hypertension, hypersplenism and varices.\u00a0\u00a0Portal pressure of 15. Our doctor has told us to be on the lookout for any kind of variceal bleeding because it could be a life or death situation. *scary thought* but it may or may not ever happen...Our GI is thinking that it could be autoimmune hepatitis. I never knew that even existed! But apparently I have heard that once you have one autoimmune disease the chances of you getting another are higher.Is there anybody else going through liver problems/cirrhosis that has type 1 diabetes? How long does compensated cirrhosis last? Just did a MRCP waiting for results. Suggestions? reading?",
