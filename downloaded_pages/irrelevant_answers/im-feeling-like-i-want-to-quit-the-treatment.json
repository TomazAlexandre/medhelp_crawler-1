            "answer": "Hi Barb...remember me?...I started TX the same day you did so I'm right here with you.I don't have answers for you but I can tell you what's going on with me at this point...\u00a0\u00a0As far as the red bumps, I started getting them weeks ago on my back and now they have spread to my chest and, yes, they itch like crazy.\u00a0\u00a0I have been doing pretty good about keep the itch to a low burn with Aveeno products, including the hydrocortisone cream.I also have had problems with the shakes or internal tremors and, in fact, I had my monthly appt with the NP on a day when they were particularly bad and she didn't even seem to care about it at all.\u00a0\u00a0I finally told her that the jitters were starting to make me crazy so she gave me some Xanax (I tried ADs earlier and they made me sick) and the Xanax seems to help a lot though I only seem to need to take one or two a week now.My hair is also thinning and that just started.\u00a0\u00a0I had my hair trimmed the other day and my hair dresser told me she saw a thinning spot that I hadn't yet noticed.I've had chest pain too but I think I've traced it to severe muscle fatigue in my back/shoulder area that radiates to my chest when I'm tired.\u00a0\u00a0I've been using a heat pad and I also ordered a Homedic massager that I hope will help (once I get it).As far as your blood sugar, a normal \"fasting\" blood sugar is 110 or under - I think.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure there are more knowledgeable people on here that can help with that.\u00a0\u00a0If you were checking your BS, do you already have diabetes or were you just checking with someone else's equipment or was that a test from the doc's lab?\u00a0\u00a0If it was from the doc, did he/she have anything to say about it?I have also had diarrhea (in fact, had it today) and the color sounds a lot like what you describe.So, hang in there Barbie...I know it's not fun but I truly believe we can get through this.\u00a0\u00a0I totally understand your feeling of wanting to quit...I've had days like that too...but that's why the rest of us will all chime in and tell you:\u00a0\u00a0\"Stick with us, Barb, you can do it...there will be better days!\"",

What level suggests prediabetes?A level of 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) indicates impaired fasting glucose \u2014 commonly known as prediabetes.

To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may repeat the fasting blood sugar test several days to a week later.What level suggests type 1 or type 2 diabetes?A level of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher is consistent with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may repeat the fasting blood sugar test on another day.

            "answer": "If you're getting tremors in your hands as in you notice your hands are shaking and your equilibrium is a little off, ask your doctor to run a thyroid test.\u00a0\u00a0It might not be your thyroid at play but could be, not uncommon for this to develop on treatment.\u00a0\u00a0I started to get tremors in my hands and I wrote it off at first as another side of treatment only it got progressively worse and my equilibrium started being off and my doctor immediately had me tested for thyroid and I came back as hyperthyroid.\u00a0\u00a0I'd ask about it.\u00a0\u00a0It's too bad that your NP writes off sides like that as anxiety when there could be an underlying medical reason for it.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.Trish",
