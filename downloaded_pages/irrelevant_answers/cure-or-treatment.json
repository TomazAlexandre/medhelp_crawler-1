            "answer": "Someday there may be a whole different cure for HCV. Also, because screening of the blood supply has improved so much, thirty years from now it will be a much smaller issue and not as many people may care.For now however there is only one treatment. I don't think you should be so cavalier. It's not unusual to have had the disease for 30 years You might feel great today and be seriously ill ten years from now. That is still twenty years short of your expected lifespan.What you need to do is obtain a liver biopsy to establish your current level of liver damage. If it is slight, you can afford to wait for new treatments. If it is substantial, you will need to consider treatment. Once liver damage has progressed to cirrhosis, the chances of successfully treating the illness go down and treatment becomes more complicated.Try not to bury your head in the sand. There are people who love you and care about you and want you to be healthy and around for a long time. You owe it to them to be responsible in managing your illness.",

MANY people have cured and I personally believe its DEFINTELY worth the trip...I didnt want to wait for better drugs I thought I would try now...Im a stage 2 so I do have the opportunity to wait but decided to give it a shot...If it doesnt work this time I will more than likely wait two years and try again!I also have lived fine with the disease HOWEVER why let it progress when we have a chace in curing it?? It was worth the 55 weeks I invested in my liver!Wish you well.Charm27",
