            "answer": "Hello.Diabetes was a possibility but I guess it can be rule out since he is not diabetic. How are his recent blood sugars ?Levaquin has some side effects of foot / toe numbness. You can ask his doctor about the dose of Levaquin. ( dose reduction might help.)A third possibility is a nerve compression at the lower back. An MRI of the lower back will be needed, if the numbness persists for a few more weeks and even after Levaquin is stopped.Regards",

            "answer": "Thank you.His fasting sugars have been borderline above upper limits.\u00a0\u00a0Family history is reassuring but we will continue diet and exercise.We thought about the lower cord/cauda equina too.\u00a0\u00a0But no other dermatomal affectations nor pain or sensory radiations down both or either leg.The bilateral toe numbness began about a week into the Levaquin.\u00a0\u00a0His prostatitis symptoms are much improved so we'll discuss with his doc about dose reduction vs discontinuation.Your help is very much appreciated.Thank you again,Whipple",
