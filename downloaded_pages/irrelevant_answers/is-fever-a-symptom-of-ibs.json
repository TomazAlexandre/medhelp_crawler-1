            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Since IBS is an inflammatory process, it can cause a low grade fever like you have. Dehydration is another cause of low grade fever so increase your fluid intake and see if it helps.Other possibilities are colitis or maybe even gluten or lactose intolerance. Anemia, diabetes and thyroid disorders too can raise the body temperature to some extent.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined to rule out these causes. Take a second opinion if need be. Take care!",

    "question": "I had a problem a few months ago with blood in my stool.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor performed some tests (colonoscopy) and did not find the problem.\u00a0\u00a0During the colonoscopy something that may have been a tumor was discovered and removed, and I had some tests to try and rule out cancer (CT scan, bloodwork, urinalysis, etc.)Nothing abnormal was found otherwise.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor gave me a default diagnosis of ibs said to schedule another appointment in a couple of months.I had been complaining about a fever, however.\u00a0\u00a0I have had it for over a month (my temperature usual ranges between 99.2-100.2).My question: is it common for a fever symptoms to accompany someone with IBS?\u00a0\u00a0I am not comfortable with just ignoring these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor seemed to dismiss it.",
