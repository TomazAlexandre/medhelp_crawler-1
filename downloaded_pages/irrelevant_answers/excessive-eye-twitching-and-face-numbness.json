            "answer": "May I ask what the humira is for? Is this for RA? This may sound like a dumb idea, but have you thought about seeing a genetic specialist? Sometimes disorders that have a congenital heart defect and can cause other medical problems are a genetic disorder that can be detected. It is just a thought. One more thing, have they checked and made sure your metabolic system is ok...For example-thyroid, parathyroid,) and last but not least did they run a check on your blood gases and electrolytes. Peace and hope you feel better soon.",
