            "answer": "I am worried about this too, I am 42 and overweight. I am on medication for high blood pressure already. I am 7w preg. I am trying not to eat what I shouldn't, but sometimes I am soooo hungry I just can't help myself :-( I think you can eat as much fruit and veg that you like, making sure you get red meat. And maybe have just one day a week where you can just have anything you like. Thats what I am trying to do. Good luck",

            "answer": "Congrats on your pregnancy!\u00a0\u00a0Right now is not the time to worry too much about weight, especially not about losing it.\u00a0\u00a0Instead, as RmberMe said, focus on eating healthy...lean meants, fruits and veggies, lots of fiber and water.\u00a0\u00a0As far as I know there aren't a whole lot of extra risks associated with pregnancy while overweight.\u00a0\u00a0Blood pressure and gestational diabetes are the only ones that come to mind, and you will be monitored and tested for both.If you already have an exercise regime, don't be afraid to continue although you do want to avoid heavy lifting, etc. as you get further along.\u00a0\u00a0Walks at a brisk pace are great, at a slower pace if you are not accustomed to exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Don't focus on weight, focus on being and staying as healthy as you can.\u00a0\u00a0Congrats again!!",

    "question": "I am 5 wks pregnant and I am about 40LBS overweight. I was normal weight with my last two pregnancies. I never lost the 40 LBS I gained with the last baby I had 18 months ago. What is a good amount of weight to gain with this pregnancy since I am already a bit too large? I do not want to diet and restrict calories but I want to be sure I am not gaining too much also. Thanks",
