            "answer": "As a person that has had neck and back surgery, my opinion is that a person should only have one of these surgeries unless you absolutely have too. Because there's a chance it might not solve all the problems.If you're in unbearable pain all the time and can't function and have tried everything else then you should consider it. However, it not a magic fix. The thinking is that, if you\u2019re in unbearable pain, any improvement will be better than nothing.The other alternative is seeing a good Physical Therapist or Chiropractor with extensive low back experience. If you decide to try this, make sure you find a good and reputable one, there are a lot of quacks out there.My back went out on me again a couple months ago and I had a Doctor that wanted to do another fairly extensive low back surgery. I was in terrible pain, I couldn\u2019t walk for several days, my X-rays and MRI were and are horrible, I didn\u2019t even want to hear all the things that where wrong. There was no way I could spend 6 months recovering from another back surgery so I started seeing a Chiropractor, he got me back to where I can function, I still have pain, but at least I can function. Something to think about.Take Care",
