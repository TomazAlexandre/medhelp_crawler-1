            "answer": "Hi ive had diabetes it only effects ur baby's weight it means ur body is producing to much insulin which is passing through to ur baby causing high levels of insulin to go through the placenta which causes baby to start gaining abnormal amounts of weight which they can telk on ur scan when they measure babys tummy. In very rare cases it can cause still born if not controlled but very unlikely. It also may affect baby when born cause it was used to having high amounts of insulin so once they no longer have u to support that they cant seem to control there insulin making but will be watched closely after birth with foot pricks. Once baby is norn u will no longer have diabetes but do have a high risk of getting diabetes again.",

Is it possible that finding out so late has already taken its toll on me and the baby? Will it completely go away after the baby is born?
