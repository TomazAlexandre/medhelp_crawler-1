    "question": "Just an updateThe dizzyness has subsided but i have my bad days.I have been to the neorologist and have come to find out i have Neoperthy in my feet and hands from diabetes type 2 which i ignored for a long time.My blood sugars were out of control for a long time and some damage was done.I am going to a endocrinologist and he will do further testing to figure out if my autoimmune system(nerves that control unvoluntary muscles) are damaged but the neoro ran an EEG and BAER test and a brain mri and ct says all brain waves and patterns seem normal so thats a good sign.Ent is on Monday cause the BAER test showed problems within my ears(dizzyness related) somewhere so the initial diagnosis of Vestibular Nerontis may have been correct.Well im off hope you all are feeling welll and hope for all of us to be healthy:)",
