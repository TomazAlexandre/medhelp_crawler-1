            "answer": "20 pounds weight loss on a little Yorkie? Are you sure? He cant have lost so much weight!...but never mind the deails...the best idea is to take him to the vet, and ask the vet to do a full blood profile.There are a few reasons why a dog starts to drink more water, eat more, and yet lose weight. Let the vet find out what is wrong, and begin treating your dog straight away, and hopefully there will be a great improvement.",

            "answer": "There are two things that you said that definitely make me think it could be diabetes - the extreme weight loss and the constant ravaging hunger.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetic dogs will eat anything and everything just to be eating.\u00a0\u00a0Things they never even noticed before will become VERY appealing to them, they will eat just to be eating.Diabetes isn't the awful disease it once was.\u00a0\u00a0It can be managed quite nicely with diet and/or medication and your vet will probably be able to diagnose it with a simple blood test.\u00a0\u00a0Please let us know what happens.Ghilly",
