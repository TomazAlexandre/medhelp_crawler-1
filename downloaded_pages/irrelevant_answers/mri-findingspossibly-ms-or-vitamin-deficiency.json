            "answer": "I reciently spent time in a rehabilitation facility. My doctor there was a kindly old gentleman and he told me of a doctor that is now retired (maybe dead) who related a patients story that was VERY SIMILAR to the problems and symptoms that we all have.Try Googleing PUDENDAL NERVE ENTRAPMENT, and FEMERAL NERVE ENTRAPEMENT; and see what ya'll think. There are very few doctors in the country that specialize in this field. One in Cal. that has developed an MRI procedure that showes nerves. My doctor said that it is definately a nerve problem and not a muscular problem! My occurences happen when I stand up from a slightly reclined position (as if relaxing on the sofa). He feels that in that position, I may be irritating or pinching a nerve that travels from the back, through the pelvic region, and down the leg.Do the google thing and see what ya'll think.",

    "question": "I have posted quite a few times on this forum trying to find answers as to whats going on with me. I am 21 years old & pretty much healthy. For the last almost five months I have been having these weird symptoms. First it started with this cramping-pulling pain on my left side & my right arm. Than started the dizziness & ear pains (popping, buzzing, etc.) I got a few episodes of that..than I started getting lightheaded and disoriented & having Insomnia..I don`t sleep very well..its like everytime I have an attack theres some new weird symptom. When they would happen I would get this horrible dry mouth, frquent urination, fatigue, & some pains here & there. Now when the attacks happen I get cramping pulling pains mostly in my left foot and leg, frequent thirst & urination, tired, muscle twitches mainly in legs and some in arms, insomnia,heart palpitations (my heart races & than skips a beat) low and high blood pressure when I get the lightheaded feeling my blood pressure drops to like 102-109.. now its up to like 127-132..thats high for me. I had an attack last week & all of a sudden I`m always hot & sweating in 73 degree weather..& the symptoms come & go but usually thre cramping pain & sweating are always there. I`ve been to my primary who did blood labs a few times & so did the emergency room everything is normal. The neuro did two MRI`s one of my neck & one of my brain. The brain scan found a cyst in the right meckel`s cave with no pressure & the neck scan found two bulging discs in my neck. I`m to the point where I`m a basket case & my primary is at odds because he`s checked for everything from hypo or hyperthyroidism to potassium problems. I`ve also been to an ENT who found nothing wrong but mild hearing loss. If anyone knows please help! Could the cyst be causing all of these problems. I don`t think it would cause the sweating & urination..",
