            "answer": "Please post your current thyroid labs along with reference ranges (vary lab to lab).Also, which meds do you take and what's your current dose?Have you ever been diagnosed with Hashi's?My guess, without any of the answers to my questions above, is that you are probably undermedicated or on the wrong combination of meds.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like you still have a lot of lingering hypo symptoms.Another thought:\u00a0\u00a0If your original symptoms four years ago had only to do with females hormones and adrenals, it would seem that once those were resolved, your thyroid and/or conversion would have kicked back in, which doesn't seem to have been the case.That being said, it is possible to get off meds once you start.\u00a0\u00a0It's usually advisable to wean off to give your thyroid time to readjust and ramp up production of hormones.\u00a0\u00a0Also, it you cut back a small amount and your labs get worse or you start getting more or worse hypo symptoms, it's a pretty good indication that you do need the meds.\u00a0\u00a0You can avoid the worst of the symptoms by moving slowly.Have you discussed this with your doctor?",

Your advice could cause someone more harm than good.It would be interesting to see documented proof that pinching some skin on your hand followed by certain breathing rhythm can cure so many health disorders. Don't we all wish it was that simple.If someone was to follow your advice on Sunshine_67's other post and stopped taking thyroid replacement med, in time, they could be hospitalized.",

            "answer": "I haven't had labs done in several months. My current doc has been dosing based on symptoms. I do have Hashi's and also hypopituitarism and I think my hypothalamus is also not working.I do feel more hypo when my dose is lowered, but since I've increased my dose, I feel even worse. I\"m not hyper. I don't feel shakey or anxious and my heart isn't beating fast. I just feel more tired, weak and lethargic and also more thirsty. I read the hypothalamus controls the kidneys and I've been told I have some kidney issues. So I wonder if taking more thyroid meds without addressing the hypothalamus or pituitary has made things worse.",

    "question": "I'm really thinking I should have never been put on thyroid meds to begin with, at least before my female hormones and adrenals were fixed, but now that I've been on them for 4 years, I don't think I can come off of them. Before I was on thyroid meds I was tired a lot and had other mild hypo symptoms, but I could still function. I could socialize with friends, stay up past 10:00, exercise. Since I started on thyroid meds my health has gone downhill. My TSH at the time I started was 3.6 and my FT4 was 1.01, so I was hypo, but I also had very low female hormones (some were in the negatives they were so low). So if the thyroid meds are what's causing the problem, what can I do?",
