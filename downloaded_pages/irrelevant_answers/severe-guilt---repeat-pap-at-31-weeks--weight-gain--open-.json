            "answer": "I gained about the same amount and my doctor says my weight is fine. I was 130 before getting preg. but I think it depends on how much you weigh before pregnancy that determines how much you should gain. But women gain different amounts of weight with different pregnancy. My sister in law gained 55lbs with her first two and only 25 with her third. As for a repeat pap. No I didnt have to have one but have known someone who has and everything was fine. I am sure it will be the same with you Try not to worry",

            "answer": "I think they worry about gestational diabetes.My doctor is constantly going on about my weight. I have gained 30 lbs altogether so far and I am at 35 weeks, but when I was at 28 weeks I was more or less the same as you.I have been told to eliminate bread and pasta and cakes from my diet (which I managed to do for a week, as I got scared due to a Placenta problem), but I have since been given the all clear and have been trying to eat normal, but I find myself constantly hungry.As to your worries about sleeping, you will wake up if there is a problem (she will let it be known to you).Sometimes a Pap test has to be repeated when certain cells come back adnormal, and they may repeat it upto 3 times, so again standard procedure.",

UGH!!!\u00a0\u00a0I also wake up on my back and stomach sometimes and wonder if she is OK. I think the babies are fine-you can't help what you do in your sleep.\u00a0\u00a0As far as the weight gain I don't know what to say because I am doing worse than you. I don't overeat and it has always been hard for me to maintain my weight. I seem to be filled with alot of fluid because my ankles really swell. Good luck to you, I know it is soooo hard to not gain too much weight! :)",

I also just happned to ask about my blood pressure (I never have) and she said so far I've been normal.I was curious about my GD test because I've heard that more than likely women who do get GD will also get regular diabetes in a few years. It runs in my family so I was worried.I really dont know how to eat now.\u00a0\u00a0Prepregnancy, I would take in between 1300-about 1800 calories a day. So now that I cant and dont have to eat like that, I just sorta eat what I want when I'm hungry.",

And I weigh myself every morning naked, so I think I'm right.I'm still waiting to fing out about GD, but since they haven't called I'm assuming that everything is okay.I don't cheat a lot either and I actually feel better when I have sugar. I find if I don't have it for a day or two that I get really dizzy and sick like. Maybe I'm the kind that needs chocolate.. :)",

    "question": "I'm wondering if what I'm feeling is common.\u00a0\u00a0I woke up this morning feeling SO guilty.\u00a0\u00a0I had a dr. appointment yesterday and came out of it sorta depressed. She told me that i've gained to much weight so far.\u00a0\u00a0I've gained 25 lbs and I'm 28 weeks. Will to much weight gain affect the baby in anyway? I'm disappointed in myself. Is the extra weight just something that will set ME back personally, but not affect her in anyway?\u00a0\u00a0I'm just wondering what would make her bring it up. She asked if I eat a lot of sweets which, I really dont. Just food sometimes that is probably not the best for us.Also, I feel guilty because I've started to go into deep sleeps again (like the 1st trimester).\u00a0\u00a0I wake up scared to death that I did something bad in my sleep that might affect her (sleep on my belly & back).\u00a0\u00a0I dont remember anything throughout the night.I know it may sound stupid to some but, this is something i deal with all the time.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like a bad mother already. I woke up on my back last night.\u00a0\u00a0I must have been there for a long time. Then when I moved to my left, she started to kick up a storm. She probably didnt have enough room?Also, My dr. told me that I have to have a repeat pap at my next visit. I will be 31 weeks by then. I'm just curious to know if anyone else has to have a repeat pap also?\u00a0\u00a0The first one came back abnormal, they did a colposcopy and basically, I know nothing about what's going on.\u00a0\u00a0So why the second pap if she says she's may have to do a byopsy after the baby is here? Isn't it definetly going to come out abnormal again?",
