            "answer": "Hello and welcome. What you describe could be MS but could be so many other conditions as well. Most of that will depend on your neuro evaluation, and I know that can be a long time coming. If it is, ask your primary doc for blood work to rule out thyroid problems and deficiencies in vitamin D and B12, also for the Western Blot Lyme disease test and tests for inflammation. I'm assuming all your other blood tests are normal.Also, see an ophthalmologist, or preferably a neuro-ophthalmologist to have your eye issues evaluated.Get copies of all reports and test results, as well as the actual MR images, and take them with you to the neuro appointment. Be prepared with a brief timeline of your symptoms in written form. If the doctor isn't interested in it (some are, some aren't), you'll at least have it to refer to yourself. Of course, keep your own copy too.Meanwhile read our Health Pages for you own information, but don't fixate on MS or any other outcome. It's too soon for that. Above all, don't tell any doctor what you think you might have, or let it be known you've gained quite a bit of knowledge. Just act pleasantly interested. That's the best way of dealing with all these preliminaries, as I and so many others here have learned.Good luck.ess",

            "answer": "I hear you. Know you are not alone. These reports are scary because they are in a different language, I got my first MRI in the mail with the Neurologist having closed his practice and left town. The new Neurologist would not look at the report or explain it to me. A Doctor friend finally sat down and explained the report piece by piece with an anatomy book of the brain. He could not tell me if I had MS. He could only say there was something Neurologically wrong with my reflexes and the MRI.A MRI is just a tool it diagnosis nothing by itself. It does not actually see your brain as megapixel photograph, it sees like hand puppets on the wall. The radiologist just list possibilities. A Neurologist will take a history and do a neurological exam. The neurological exam will tell him if you have Neurological problems and what part of the brain or spinal cord is involved. It is just reflexes and stuff. My MS was found by my Primary Care when she did a Neurological exam. She could tell I was not getting signals to left side of my body, like I was on the right. There are 33 other diseases which act like MS which are not neurological. He then may order other tests and blood work to rule out other illnesses.I do not look at my MRI results anymore until I see my Neurologist. They can seem pretty scary if you are not a doctor. I would look up the terms on the internet and try to interpret them. Then I would be really anxious. In my case needlessly even though it did turn out to be MS. The MS is not as bad as not knowing and my imagination. Some people have brains that look like swiss cheese and have no real issues with or with out MS while others can have no lesions and have MS.They may not have even done yours under MS protocol with Contrast and lots of what they call slices of the brain. My first one had contrast but they were looking for something else so it was not MS protocol.We are all individuals. One thing I have learned in my case with MS and Cancer is a lot of times you do not do what your disease is supposed to. I thought I was supposed to have every bad thing of illness happen to me. I have rarer forms of both. I am supposed to be in a wheelchair at this point with the kinda of MS I have and I am walking, riding horses, and dancing. Chemo does not work for my form or Cancer guess what it did.I freak myself out with guessing the future especially my two years from the day the Doctors said I may have MS until I was finally diagnosed. Try to have faith that whatever it turns out to be you will get symptom relief and feel a bit better.Hang in there.Alex",

    "question": "Hi, I am new to this forum but am excited about being here.\u00a0\u00a0I just had an MRI of my brain and was told by my Dr. to see a neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing else was said.\u00a0\u00a0I read my results and was a little concerned.\u00a0\u00a0Here is what the result was.\u00a0\u00a0There is nonenhancing nonspecific bilateral superacentorial white matter disease.\u00a0\u00a0The largest white matter lesion is in the lower left centrum semiovale and corona radiaca and has perpendicular orientation to the ventricles and measures about 7.3 mm in greatest transverse x about 4 mm in AP dimension.\u00a0\u00a0There are multiple smaller white matter lesions.\u00a0\u00a0These changes can be seen with either chronic small vessel disease or demyelination amount other etiologies.\u00a0\u00a0Since I have not seen the neurologist yet I have been reading a lot of information about MS and the things in my MRI show up.\u00a0\u00a0I have so many symptoms but don't know if they go with MS or not.\u00a0\u00a0I have short term memory loss and when I am talking I will forget a simple word.\u00a0\u00a0It can be a word that I know very well but I can't for the life of me remember it.\u00a0\u00a0I have Left eye pain and a lot of headaches.\u00a0\u00a0I have weakness in my legs after walking even a short distance and I sometimes lose my balance.\u00a0\u00a0I have not fallen but am afraid I might.\u00a0\u00a0Not only do I have the sharp pain in my left eye but I have noticed my vision is not the same.\u00a0\u00a0My glasses just are not strong enough for me any more.\u00a0\u00a0I do have problems with my bowels and my bladder.\u00a0\u00a0My worse pain is in my back and that is almost non stop.\u00a0\u00a0I guess my question is, does this sound familiar to anyone here with MS?\u00a0\u00a0Oh, I have had MRI's before of the brain and never had lesions before.\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate any feedback I can get.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you and God bless",
