            "answer": "marching on,thanks for the post.Is their a link between high blood pressure and diabetes or Long QT? Is it really prudent that I return to cardio for any follow up since I feel fine?The link I would be concerned about is syncope and long QT. The actual QT interval on the ECG should be interpreted by a cardiologist and further investigation for arrythmogenic causes of your syncope should be exmined if your ecg is abnormal.good luck",

            "answer": "I think what the doctors normally do is to rule out secondary causes of sudden onset of HBP, namely like thyroid, kidney, diabetes problems.\u00a0\u00a0In your case, it may be good to check kidney functions as it is one of those organs affected by diabetes and kidney plays a role in regulating our BP.The doctor will most likely prescribe beta-blockers or combination of other medicine. If you're on beta-blocker and you have diabetes, you should monitor your blood sugar level because beta-blockers tend to mask low blood sugar.",

    "question": "Hi, Thank you for your time.Quick follow up. I had an episode of syncope a few weeks back.\u00a0\u00a0Blood pressure was high, went to Dr., still high, began taking beta blocker. Blood work also revealed high blood sugar @ 120, but not quite high enough to be labeled \"diabetic\".\u00a0\u00a0I was sent to a fine cardiologist, and had EKG which was fine, except for what cardiologist said \"Long QT \" something.\u00a0\u00a0I'm going back next month.\u00a0\u00a0I am a female in 40's good health, exercise, don't smoke, married, high stress job. Don't know much about family history, since I was adopted.I feel fine now. Medicine works good.My question is:\u00a0\u00a0Is their a link between high blood pressure and diabetes or Long QT? Is it really prudent that I return to cardio for any follow up since I feel fine?ThanksAna",
