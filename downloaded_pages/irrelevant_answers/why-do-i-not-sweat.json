            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Well, a sympathetic-parasympatheic innervations defect can cause decreased sweating as in your case. Certain peripheral neuropathies like in diabetes and hypothyroidism can also be responsible. Certain skin conditions causing harm or blockage to sweat glands too can cause this problem. History of burns and Sjogren\u2019s syndrome too should be looked into. Please consult a neurologist and a skin specialist. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Take care!",
