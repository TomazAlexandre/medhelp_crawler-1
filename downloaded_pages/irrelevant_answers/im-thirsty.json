            "answer": "Hi, I am a water drinker too, had a mini fridge in my office pre op to keep filled with water...lol....but, I was not driven to drink, if u know what I mean.Even blood labs can appear normal with diabetes,....there r many silent symptoms,check family history and see if there is a more advance test to rule it out if in fact it is a family trait.As for it being chiari related, not sure y, but I steer clear of soda's too, when I am thirsty only water quenches my thirst.To be safe..always rule out other medical possibilities as chiari should not be assumed as the cause for everything going on, we can have more then chiari to deal with....so do be careful and always check .",

    "question": "I have days where I am so thirsty that I just cant get enough water! It isnt every single day but often. Before I had found out about the Chiari I had actually went to my doctor because everyone at work was saying that it just wasnt normal to drink that much water. They did blood tests and everything they tested came back normal. I know im not dehydrated I drink plenty of water every day because I dont drink pop or anything with a lot of sugar and go to the gym nearly every night I can if I am not feeling too bad, so im conscience about how much i drink. But I drank 3 of the gallon jugs of ozarka water and still wanted more but my manager cut me off and said no that i was going to start leaking water out of my ears if i drank anymore. lol. im just wondering if this could be associated with the Chiari",
