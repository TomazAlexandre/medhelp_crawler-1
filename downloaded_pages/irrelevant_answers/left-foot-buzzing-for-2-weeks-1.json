            "answer": "Hi.Your symptoms are non-specific at best and can be related to many conditions. Answering several questions might help determine what you may be suffering from.When you experience the buzzing, do you also have a strong urge to move the affected foot? When you move the affected foot, does it relieve the buzzing sensation? Are the buzzing sensations more noticeable when sitting or during nighttime? Does it interfere with your sleep? Is there anyone in your family who experiences the same symptoms?Your symptoms can be due to vitamin or mineral deficiencies, thyroid disorder, diabetes, nerve irritation or compression, etc. However, if all your answers to the questions above is yes, there is also a possibility that you may be suffering from restless leg syndrome (RLS).RLS has been reported to be caused by many conditions, including stress, peripheral neuropathy from chronic diseases such as diabetes, iron deficiency, kidney failure, and it can also be hereditary.If you are concerned about your symptoms, it would be advisable to consult a physician to evaluate your condition.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Greetings!and thanks a bunch for responding! as per your first question, moving it doesnt do much, as the buzzing is intermitten.. the symptoms are only noticeable when I am off my feet and no it does not interfere with my sleep. I had my thyroid checked about 1 year ago as well as for diabetes and checked out fine ... I do alot of exercise\u00a0\u00a0ie: weightlifting, cardio vascular training (in which when I am doing an intense session I will usually have a mild intermittn pain on the left side of what it feels like as my brain), which is why I think it could possibly all be nerve related?? I dont know any further discussion is most helpful!! thanks a ton!-Omega3",

            "answer": "Hi.It is good to hear that your other laboratory tests turned out okay, which would narrow down the possibilities.If your other symptoms occur during training, it would also suggest a cardiovascular condition as one of the possible causes, aside from a nerve-related condition.It would be advisable to consult a doctor to check out your symptoms and to rule out any serious condition that could possibly cause them. In the meantime, you should limit any strenuous exercise. Or you could also try to stop doing any training for the moment and see if the symptoms could also possibly be related to muscular fatigue.Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Greetings Godofredo!!the head pain symptom I can trace to my upper neck on the left side between the neck and head which I think is a nerve that shoots pain if my head is positioned in an upward position for strenuous lengths of time. I told my general doctor of all this and he gave me the basic neurological examination and said there wasnt anything that concerned him to send me to a neurologist. I think he knows I am a tad bit of a hypochondriac .. I have had this for over a year and for over a year I have trained hard with cardiovascular exercise and weights... CNS issues/pain/etc runs in my dads side of the family so I am curious if all of this could be related to that.... my dad did every test in the book but pretty much chased phantoms as doctors could never find anything wrong ... I dont know I will go back to my doctor and tell him about our discussions.",

            "answer": "Hi.Yes, it is indeed possible, given that presentation, that a nerve impingement at the upper cervical section could cause such symptoms. However, your neck muscles could also present as such if strained due to the head position coupled with strenuous exercise. Increased blood pressure could also lead to these symptoms during extreme workouts.It really would be advisable to stop those strenuous exercises for the moment to let your body recuperate then after all symptoms have resolved, you can slowly get back to your routine, taking care not to overdo the exercises.The health issues that run in your family may or may not be associated, and this would depend on the type of illness that they have.You should go ahead and talk to your doctor about all these.Good luck.",
