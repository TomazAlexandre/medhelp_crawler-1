            "answer": "The treatment for ketoacidosis is to correct the high blood glucose level by giving more insulin, including extra fluid to prevent dehydration.I don't know what you mean by \"the pacemaker thing for the stomach?\", can only assume it is a stomach pump to empty its contents caused by gastroparesis.Have you talked with your sisters doctor/s? Or the lead nurse? They have first hand knowledge of your sisters test results and medical records and would know the next step/s in her treatment for recovery not anyone on a health forum. Hopefully someone with a nursing background will come along to provide further assistance.",

Do a Google search on Diabetic Gastrophy, look for the link The Diabetic Stomach - Management Strategies for Clinicians and... read the article as it may pertain to your sister.",

    "question": "My sister is a 53 diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0She has not had medical insurance for many years and so has not had her diabetes under control as well as she should/could have.\u00a0\u00a0She has developed what they are calling diabetic stomach.\u00a0\u00a0I have done some research and I have some issues wit her current medical care.\u00a0\u00a0First, they diagnosed her with a heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0Then they took out her gallbladder on the 10th of this month.\u00a0\u00a0Now they are calling it diabetic stomach (gastroparesis).\u00a0\u00a0She has been throwing up uncontrollably off and on for 2 years. She went in on the 10th and they removed her gallbladder.\u00a0\u00a0She went home from that and was back in the hospital on the 14th or 15th.\u00a0\u00a0They kept her until last night, sent her home and she is headed back to the hospital this morning, still throwing up.\u00a0\u00a0They are talking about inserting a feeding tube into her small intestine to bypass her stomach.\u00a0\u00a0It is my understanding that there is a devise that can be implanted to take of the job of the vagus nerve.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to me this would be the optimal treatment to allow her to have the best quality of life.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone gone thru this and if so, what was your treatment and how effective was it?",
