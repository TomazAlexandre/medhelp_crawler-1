            "answer": "Your peroxidase (TPOab) is a thyroid antibody test.\u00a0\u00a0If it is elevated, which it is, it indicates an autoimmune condition.\u00a0\u00a0This can be Grave's disease (hyper) or Hashi's (hypo).Besides the enlarged thyroid, what are your symptoms?Your bloodwork looks hyper.\u00a0\u00a0FT3 and FT4 are above range, and TSH is very low.\u00a0\u00a0However, your uptake scan is a bit contradictory, since, as you say, it indicates very low thyroid activity.Were the bloodwork and scans done at the same time?",

            "answer": "It's a relief to know that you see somewhat contradictory results, too.The blood draw was last Sunday and the scan was done Tuesday/Wednesday.My thyroid is enlarged and also painful.\u00a0\u00a0Some days are better than others but I'm taking ibuprofen pretty regularly.As for other symptoms, they seem to be all over the place, too.\u00a0\u00a0My fingernails have become brittle, I'm really tired sometimes, my heart races sometimes, my thinking is slow/confused sometimes; I haven't lost or gained weight; I can be quite moody (although at age 49 there are plenty of hormones contributing to that!).My thyroid is nowhere near as sore and swollen as it was a month ago when it was at its worst.\u00a0\u00a0The inside of my throat had two raw patches that made it hard to swallow and I had to take ibuprofen religiously or the pain was too much.\u00a0\u00a0Now my thyroid is about 1/3 the size it was then except for the front.\u00a0\u00a0Now that part is so swollen that I'm hoarse all the time.What do you think?",

            "answer": "Well, I'm looking at 59 at my next birthday (good-bye cushion between me and the big six-oh).\u00a0\u00a0The hormones may have calmed down, but I'm not sure that's an improvement!\u00a0\u00a0Not feeling well can make you pretty moody, too.I have to say that if I just looked at your bloodwork, I'd say Grave's without thinking twice...FT3 and FT4 are over the top, TSH is virtually non-existent, TPOab positive.\u00a0\u00a0It all fits.\u00a0\u00a0I've been trying to fit the uptake results in with this, and I just can't.\u00a0\u00a0You've even sent me back to the internet to see if I can find anything similar...no luck there, either.\u00a0\u00a0Is there any possibility that something affected the scan results?\u00a0\u00a0Meds or supplements?\u00a0\u00a0Iodine consumption?\u00a0\u00a0High iodine foods?\u00a0\u00a0Big, big fan of sushi?!As long as the swelling is not affecting your breathing or swallowing, I don't think it's a problem to wait until the 9th.\u00a0\u00a0That's just a week from Monday, and it would probably be difficult to get anything sooner.\u00a0\u00a0Your hoarseness is most likely due to the enlargement pressing on the laryngeal nerve, which causes voice changes.It's also possible that you are in a hyper phase of Hashi's.\u00a0\u00a0Although this is ultimately a hypothyroid condition, there is often an initial hyper phase (usually short lived...several days).\u00a0\u00a0In addition, some types of nodules (most of us with Hashi's have nodules) can \"leak\" rather than secrete hormones into the bloodstream.\u00a0\u00a0This happens in a pretty uncontrolled manner and can cause swings from hypo to hyper.Sorry I can't offer more...would love an update after you've seen the endo to see what he has to say.I'm going to PM someone who I know knows a lot about Grave's and ask her to take a look at this thread.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe she'll be more familiar with your scenario.",
