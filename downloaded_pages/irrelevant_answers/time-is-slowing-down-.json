I practically begged my midwife for an induction date because I know this baby won't be coming anytime soon. Honestly I didn't care when she scheduled for, I just wanted a date so I can really countdown the days and know for sure when it will end. But she didn't. She told me to come back in three days and then they will decide.\u00a0\u00a0I have two days till my due date",
