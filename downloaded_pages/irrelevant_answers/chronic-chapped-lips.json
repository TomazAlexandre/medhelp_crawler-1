            "answer": "Hi,Vitamin and nutrient deficiencies do cause stomatitis or cheilitis. I suggest that you continue with your vitamin supplements. Also, it is not enough to take the supplements. A healthy and well balanced diet with adequate water intake are necessary.Was an underlying fungal or bacteria infection ruled out?Also, do you have other associated conditions like diabetes?Observe your symptoms as you continue to improve your diet. Avoid direct heat, spicy food and hot beverages. Use also a mild toothpaste (\u00a0\u00a0those which contain low fluoride levels).",

            "answer": "Biotin can help chapped lips.\u00a0\u00a0Because it is expensive, many multivitamins don't contain much of it and so they can actually make a deficiency worse.\u00a0\u00a0Try taking 5 miligrams a day for a week or two and see if that helps.\u00a0\u00a0Manganese may also help.",

    "question": "After loosing about 30 lbs too quickly, I started losing hair and having SEVERELY chapped lips. I stopped dieting and started taking multi-vitamins, and a B supplement.\u00a0\u00a0My symptoms eased but my lips are still chapped and peeling.\u00a0\u00a0I recently started taking a biotin supplement after hearing it helped with hair growth, thinking it would also help with my lips. What else can I take to fix this problem?My dermatologist does not have a solution, and when I told him about my weight loss, he agreed it was likely related and figured the vitamins would fix it.\u00a0\u00a0it has been 4 months and I still have chapped and peeling lips (though they are better) please don't offer a topical solution, I use all the best.thxThis discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/240518\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/240518</a>.",
