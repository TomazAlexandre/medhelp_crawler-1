            "answer": "Thanks for your response! I fasted for 11 hours because my eyes refused to stay open past 9:30 pm. I'm here at the lab and just finished my 3rd blood draw. The first hour after the first blood draw and glucose drink was the WORST! Thankfully I didn't throw up but I almost did. They let me drink some water which helped. I'm praying that my tests come back ok and I don't have gestational diabetes. Good luck to you!",
