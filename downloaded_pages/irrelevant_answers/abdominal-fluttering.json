            "answer": "I dont know what is causing yours but I have it in one breast on the side some days and sometimes in my left side groin area near the leg, and twitching in an arm or somewhere now and then.The fluttering is wierd at most, no pain there but feels like a little motor running there under the skin.I have neuropathy, thyroid issues and diabetes, IF you are worried ask your doc for a blood test to check for these possibilities, I believe mine is due to my neuropathy. Dont wanna scare ya but if it is new might be a reason to ask doc for some info. Even tho I have neuropathy they just look at me and say \"I dunno| cos it is probably not a usual side effect or they just dont know much about it, There is lots to learn still in neuropathy and many nerve issuesAsk your doc and take care",

            "answer": "Hi, Thank you very much for your question. These symptoms may be due to post menopausal changes. Some women find their symptoms only last 6 to 12 months, whereas others continue to have these symptoms till old age. There is great variation in both the persistence and the degree of menopausal symptoms between different women. Unfortunately there's no way to predict when her symptoms will settle and they may never without treatment. It is best to consult this with gynecologist who may organise some simple blood tests to ensure there is no other medical cause for your symptoms. Hope this helps.",
