            "answer": "Hi,Firstly, I\u2019ll request you to get a blood sugar done to rule out the possibility of diabetes. I don\u2019t think the finger cracks due to a fungal infection. No need of clotrimazole. It dries probably due to the exposure to cold. Application of some moisturizing agent/antibacterial ointment will be more than enough. Keep the finger warm by avoiding exposure to dry cold air and it should heal pretty rapidly.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted. Kind Rgds.",
