            "answer": "I wont be able to comment on your overall cardiac health without more information. However, your echocardiogram shows a normal heart function. You have mitral valve prolpase (the leaflets come together slightly higher than normal, in the upper chamber of the heart). Your mitral valve is not leaky and you have no symptoms, so there is nothing more that needs to be done at this time. Mitral valve prolapse can cause a leaky mitral valve, where blood will flow back into the left atrium when the heart squeezes. In cases of severe or symptomatic mitral regurgitation, valve repair or valve replacement can be considered.",

My recent Echocardiogram report shows only the following\u00a0\u00a0\"abnormalities:-prolapse of anterior and posterior mitral leaflets into left atrium in systole= present-mitral regurgitation =trivial- tricuspid regurgitation = trivialin doppler echo:-left atrial systolic aud. signal = abnormal\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 turbulent flow present in systole- right atrial outflow tract systolic histo. aud. signal =abnormal and turbulent flow present in systole- in color doppler- mosaic pattern present inside RA during systole due to trivial tricuspid regurgitationUnder IMPRESSION, the cardiologist has written:-mitral valve prolapse syndrome-prolapse of anterior and posterior mitral leaflets-mild posterior mitral annulus calcification present-pulmonary hypertension= nil-normal Lv contraction and function ( EF=83%)Would be grateful for comments re. overall cardiac health. I suffer from no symptoms like breathlessness, palpitation, etc. nor do I have diabetes or any other problems.",
