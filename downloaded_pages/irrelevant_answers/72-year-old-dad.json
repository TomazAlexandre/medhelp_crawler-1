            "answer": "Hi akp,First, I want to let you know that I am not a medical professional.\u00a0\u00a0My input/ advice is solely based on personal experience and knowledge that I have from taking care of my son who has had type 1 diabetes for over 6-1/2 years.My son was diagnosed at the age of 3.\u00a0\u00a0My sister is also living with type 1 diabetes and was diagnosed at the age of 24, 8 yrs. ago.To be honest, because of my personal experience, I am more familiar with type 1.The symptom you explained sounds like low blood sugar to me.These symptoms definitely need to be brought to your Dad's doctor's attention.\u00a0\u00a0His physician is the one who can best evaluate your Dads symptoms.You might want to have your Dad test his blood sugar when these bouts occur.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe your mother can do so for him, if necessary.Let us know what the outcome is.Warm Regards",

            "answer": "I agree with SS that this could be caused by hypoglycemia, and that whenever this happens, his blood sugar should be tested. If the number is below70, he should be given some juice to drink (about a half cup to one cup, depending on how low the number is), and then he should recover in about 15-30 minutes. The brain's primary source of fuel is glucose, and when the glucose numbers get too low, the brain ceases to function properly until glucose is available for it. The result can be not only a tired feeling, but a temporary inability to answer simple questions or to speak.Many older folks find that their appetites decrease as they age, and your dad may not be eating as many carbohydrates as he did 5 years ago. If he is having hypoglycemic episodes, his medicine may need to be reduced. Any pattern of time of day or frequency of lows should be discussed with his doctor in order to protect him. Severe lows can be dangerous if left untreated by quick-acting carbohydrates such as juice.Also, if he is low, he may resist any attempt to get him to drink juice... this is common among diabetics who are very low, for at that point the brain may not be functioning well enough for the diabetic to think properly or even be aware that they are low. Speak firmly to him and ORDER him to drink the juice if he resists.If this is indeed caused by hypoglycemia, he should feel and react better in about 15-30 minutes if he has been given enough juice.\u00a0\u00a0If not low when these episodes occur, he could be suffering from mini-strokes and should be checked out by his doctor before the situation gets serious. My own father-in-law has had several of these mini-strokes, and they do cause temporary brain malfunction without visible damage. Medication can prevent a serious stroke from following an episode like this.",

            "answer": "It could be hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0The way to tell is ask him a questionthat requires thought.\u00a0\u00a0For example, don't ask him \"Dad, are you feeling okay?\".\u00a0\u00a0Instead, ask him, \"Dad what's 13 minus 4?\".\u00a0\u00a0 Ifyou can't tell you, it could be hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0Or something else.If he tells you without hesitation, it's not hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0 Butthere could be other causes.",

    "question": "My dad has had dibetis for about 5 years,what seem to be a problem for him is getting his thoughts spoken. There seem to be a short circit between his thinking and speaking. It might not have anything to do with his dibetis. He takes Gluaphage (don't know how spell it)for the dibetis,and as far as I know the dibetis is under control, also, of late has had to start taking some meds for high blood pres. He is a very active man,not over weight. He is hard of earing. My mom said he has talked about this problem to her, so not just she and I have notice the problem.\u00a0\u00a0What might be this problem, could you give me some questions to ask his doctor,or at maybe lead to what might be able to fix him. So far dad has not told his doctor about this. My dad has quit preaching and teaching (something he loves to do) because of this problem. Mom and I have notice this problem for about 1 year or 2.",
