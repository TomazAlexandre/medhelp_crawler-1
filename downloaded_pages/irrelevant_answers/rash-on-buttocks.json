            "answer": "Hello,They seem like boils or furuncle. Boils are caused by infection of the hair follicle by staph aureus. Bacterial skin infections can be spread by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close human contact, or by contact with pus from a boil or carbuncle. Boil on buttocks is usually due to plugged sweat glands that become infected or by an ingrown hair.Apply warm compresses on the boil and keep the area clean.Drainage of the boil is done only when it becomes soft and forms a head.Take some over the counter pain reliever and consult a doctor for examination and antibiotics prescription. Recurrent boils are found in diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune system disorders.So pls get your blood sugar evaluated.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing and if you have any additional queries.",

    "question": "I have bumps across my buttocks. They don't come to a head and they're *not* excessively itchy.They do, however, seem to swell/spread when scratched or \"popped.\"I had a skin test done, where a swab was sent off to a lab to see if it'd produce anything on a petri, and it came back negative.I took antibiotics for them for a while, to no avail, tried diaper rash (??) ointment for a while, etc. I'm at a total loss, and have been to the doctor twice about them with no luck.Please help, it's been quite a while now... and although it waxes and wanes, it keeps coming back!",
