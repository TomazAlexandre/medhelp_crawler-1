            "answer": "It could be what's called Roemheld Syndrome, which is what Jking0302 mentioned....over stimulation of the vagus nerve (10th cranial nerve) when eating.\u00a0\u00a0http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roemheld_syndromeIt can be caused by a GI problem or a neurological problem. Given that you're experiencing migraines, you'll probably want to go see a neurologist to find out what's going on. Something could be affecting your vagus nerve.",

            "answer": "If you are getting new migraines not just headaches (terrible headache usually on one side of the head and/or eye) you should go to a neurologist to confirm that and you can get meds to help with it. In the meantime avoid MSG in foods, cheddar cheese, walnuts and too much stress or excitement. As for the dizzyness it could be part of the migraines or something else even diabetes.. If your blood sugar goes too far up when you eat it is possible that it would make you dizzy. The neurologist can order the blood test.",

    "question": "I haven't ever been one to get headaches or migraines, I hadn't had a headache in over 5 years up until recently. I find myself constantly getting migraines and it actually worries me quite a bit. Along with that, I find that every time I eat I get unbearably dizzy. This happens mid-meal, no\u00a0\u00a0matter what I eat, and sometimes it occurs when I'm drinking something like water, milk, juice, coffee. (Those are the only types of beverages I will drink) I'd really just like to know what it possibly COULD be instead of having to go to the doctors and get a huge bill to find nothing. Oh and something else to add, I never got dizzy when eating up until about my 3rd migraine. This has been going on for a month or so.",
