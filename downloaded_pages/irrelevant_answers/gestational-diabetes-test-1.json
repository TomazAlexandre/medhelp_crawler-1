It should cover what you ate and then cover the additional stuff they have you drink. You probably weren't that far off that's why they want you to do a 3 hour test to make sure you are completely in normal range.",

Ots harder to pass 1 hour even ifnu did pass which is pretty much delaying the inevitable. The 3 hour one is not bad and its best to know for sure if you has GD as you need to be on a special diet and in some cases insulin.depending on your body.",
