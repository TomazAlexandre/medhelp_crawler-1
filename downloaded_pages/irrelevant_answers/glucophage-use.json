    "question": "A week ago I went to the doctor due to experiencing menstrual cramps but no getting my period.\u00a0\u00a0(Just for background - I only menstruate when I am on the pill and I am currently not on it - therefore I do not menstruate without medication).\u00a0\u00a0She did a standard sugar test which came out as 4.4. She then decided that I must be insulin resistant and put me on Glucophage 1 in the evening without even doing any tests or telling me anything about an eating plan etc.\u00a0\u00a0I am now following a low GI eating plan I got on the internet.\u00a0\u00a0My question is - should I be on Glucophage if I was not properly tested for insulin resistance and if my sugar test came out within normal range?",
