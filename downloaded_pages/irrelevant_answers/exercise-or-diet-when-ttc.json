            "answer": "I'm no expert, but I'm just thinking back to my track days in high school. I remember a lot of girls, especially long distance runners, saying they wouldn't get their period very often due to excessive training. Its not excersise that causes irregularity in periods, its excersising too much that can cause it in many women. That's why your doctor probably said to cut back on the excersise, not to stop altogether. Actually excersising can be good to help regulate your period, but again, too much is not good when your trying to be regular and conceive. Eating healthy is always a good thing too, just make sure you get enough calories a day.",

Overdoing anything is not a great idea. As far as diet goes, I would say a sensible, balanced variety of foods to maintain a healthy lifestyle (without obsessing about every little thing :)). Good luck!",

Do you know what your estogen levels are/what they should be?For those who don't know PCOS can have stages like diabetes-you DON'T have diabetes but it messes w/your insulin levels which messes with the estrogen and causes you to produce too much testosterone. woo that was textbooky huh...anyway they would put you on metformin or a pill like it and make all your hormone levels balanced.Basicly your estrogen would be very low and testosterone very high.",
