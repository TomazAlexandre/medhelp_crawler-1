            "answer": "I am diabetic and have been for about 13 years. I would do anything for an A-1C of 5.9.\u00a0\u00a0An A-1 C of 5.9 is perfect. It means that your blood sugars have consistently been within normal ranges for the last three months. Your blood sugar was slightly elevated at 149, but it was only one hour after eating. It is best to wait 2 hours after eating to take an after meal blood test.Right now your numbers are within normal, healthy ranges. Stay away from processed flour, high fructose corn syrup (READ ALL LABELS THIS STUFF IS IN EVERYTHING) and sugar-- and you should be okay.",

            "answer": "Hello,actually the timing for your testing should be based on when you peak.\u00a0\u00a0For some people their highest is at 2 hours, in your case it is at 1 hour.\u00a0\u00a0That's fine to know.Truely normal HBA1C is in the 4s.\u00a0\u00a0So yours is not terrible, but it is also not completely normal and it is great that you are motivated to prevent this progressing.Your approach is great.\u00a0\u00a0Avoid the foods that make your blood sugar high.\u00a0\u00a0If your blood sugars are consistently kept at normal range then your pancreas is not having to work too hard and hopefully it will not progress.If you are really aiming to be 'optimal', avoid any food that puts your blood sugar higher than 120 at your peak.\u00a0\u00a0If you are less than 110 at 2 hours then it is perfect!Most people find that low carb works best.\u00a0\u00a0Some carbs can raise you more than others.\u00a0\u00a0Ie. the sweet potato worked better for you than the rye bread.\u00a0\u00a0When you are eating low carb make sure you eat more fat (unprocessed is best) so that you won't feel hungry.\u00a0\u00a0Nuts, full fat dairy, avocado, butter, olive oil, fat that comes with the meat are all good sources.\u00a0\u00a0However, do avoid deep fried foods and transfats that are present in many processed foods.If you are interested look up the book Diabetes Solutions by Dr. Richard Bernstein.\u00a0\u00a0Get the 2011 edition.\u00a0\u00a0It goes into a lot of detail about low carb diet for managing diabetes. / prediabetes.",

            "answer": "Thank you both for replying.\u00a0\u00a0Nursegirl, the reason I'm being so viligant is because I recently learned that I am genetically at high risk for heart disease (my fraternal twin has CAD), and my brother has diabetes, so at this point in my life (when these issues tend to develop), I'm doing all that I can to prevent it.\u00a0\u00a0I started the low carb diet for health reasons and was dismayed when I found out that my a1C is 5.9 which, while normal, is very high normal and, to me, it wouldn't take much to bring it to unhealthy.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor doesn't know I'm monitoring...this is just\u00a0\u00a0for my own education concerning how my body reacts to different foods.\u00a0\u00a0Supersally, my thinking mirrors yours....I simply wish to avoid foods that will raise my BG to levels like 149 (like the rye bread).\u00a0\u00a0I know it came down to 103 after an hour, but I'd rather stick to foods that don't raise it that high .\u00a0\u00a0 Right now, this monitoring is experimental to see if I can bring my A1c down.\u00a0\u00a0Frankly, I was shocked that my A1c went up because for the past 6 months the only carbs I've eaten were from vegetables, sweet potatoes, fruit, Atkins bars and low carb bread that I buy at the Health Food store (Julian's Bakery, 14 grams protein per slice, 13 g fiber, 137 calories and 2 net carbs).\u00a0\u00a0The rye bread with breakfast the other morning was part of my experiment.\u00a0\u00a0I would like to know what foods I'm eating are driving up my BG to the average indicated by an A1c of 5.9.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again for your responses and I'm always welcome to any comments and suggestions.",

It would depend on the contents of the bread and also the individual. One hour postprandial is not a relative level to judge ones glucose level. In OGTT [oral glucose tolerance test] it is used to see how high ones glucose elevates [peaks/plateaus]. If you're going to test postprandial, the proper postprandial testing time is 2-3 hours after a meal. My preference is 2.5 hrs.",

            "answer": "A person with no diabetes at all and no insulin resistance would rarely have their blood sugar go above 100, even if they ate lots of carbs.\u00a0\u00a0This is becuase their pancreas can react rapidly to changing glucose levels. In persons with prediabetes, their pancreas is in the process of losing the ability to control blood sugar.I don't think you are testing too much at this point, when you are trying to discover what makes you go high.\u00a0\u00a0However, later on you probably won't need to test so much as you can eat tried and true foods and meals and only test occassionally to see that you are still on track.\u00a0\u00a0If you are comfortable testing the way you are (and are able to get useful information from the testingthat you then use to adjust your diet approach, then there is no issue).\u00a0\u00a0The inconveneince of testing is a small price to pay compared to the benefit of preventing / delaying the onset of diabetes.You will find that it is both the total amount of carbs eaten at a meal and the type of carb that affects your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Processed carbs like cereals, breads, cakes, potatoes, anythbing made with flour, sweet fruits, tend to have the biggest effect.\u00a0\u00a0Non-starchy veges and regular fat dairy should have a lesser effect.\u00a0\u00a0Best cheeses are the unprocessed ones, which have I think 1 g of carb/1 oz serve.\u00a0\u00a0But you can look it up.Try eating different amounts of carbs/ meals.\u00a0\u00a0A starting point would be about 30 g/meal and you can adjust up or down from there.If you read the Bernstein book \"diabetes solutions' he recommends 6 g of carbs for breakfast and 12 each for lunch and dinner.\u00a0\u00a0His diet can definitely prevent progression of diabetes and makes diabetes management for those who already have it far easier.\u00a0\u00a0You may not need to be as strict as he recommends, but key is to normalise blood sugars.",
