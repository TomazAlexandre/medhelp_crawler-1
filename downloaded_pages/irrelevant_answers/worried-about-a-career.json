            "answer": "I suggest that you look at the answers to the question about whether a type 1 person can be a paramedic, for several people who posted there have researched police jobs also. Apparently, it is possible for a type 1 person to join the police force, at least in some cities (rules will differ, depending on the city, I suspect). As for National Guard, there might be different rules. He needs to actually contact the local National Guard recruiting office by calling 1-800-Go-Guard in order to find out the answer.",

    "question": "My boyfriend has been a type 1 diabetic since he was 5. He recently decided he wanted to go into the National Guard and be a MP (Military Police) but when we research it we don't get a definite answer. He decided if the answer was no then he would want to be a police officer. Which one can he do? Which one will be better for a diabetic?",
