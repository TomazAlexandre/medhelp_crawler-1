            "answer": "Hello,Itching skin without any rash can be due to dry skin, neurodermatitis or internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods .You can take some OTC oral antihistamine medications like Benadryl or Claritin and see if it helps.For mild-moderate symptoms a weak steroid may be used. Also use good quality moisturizers and wear cotton clothes.If the symptoms persist then get it evaluated from a dermatologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
