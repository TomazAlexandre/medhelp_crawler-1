    "question": "Hi ladies, i had my 35 week and 4 day check yesterday, i had a scan which all was cool he weighs 6lb 7oz already. They did say that my amonic fluid has increased so they think i might have gestational diabetes. I have to go to the hospital on wed for some tests. Lets hope when i go in hospital on tuesday to have my stitch out that i go into labor and dont have to worry about having GD. Looks like im going to have a little fattie for a son. They also said his head size is at the top end of the scale ( AHH big head). Kelly x",
