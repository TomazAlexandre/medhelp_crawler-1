            "answer": "Hi,with what you are describing I would say she is early diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Her pancrease is working in fits and starts.\u00a0\u00a0When it works she can get low blood sugar (rebound from the high) and when it eosn't work her sugars go high.Normal blood sugar in a child should be around 80.Would keep her on the high protien, high fat and low carb diet.\u00a0\u00a0Give her plenty of non-starchy veges though.\u00a0\u00a0Get her off to a pediatric endocrinologist asap.Also be careful not to overadjust for her lows.It sould take only a few grams of carbs to bring her up.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe just 1 or 2 jelly beans, followed by a protein - lower carb snack.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise you'll have her swinging high to low to high again.\u00a0\u00a0Can recommend reading Diabetes solution from Richard Bernstein (which gives good advice regarding blood sugar and diet).\u00a0\u00a0All the swinging of blood sugars will make her feel bad.",

Which we are going into the holiday weekend >.< She is thinking pre-diabetes with a possibility of hyperglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0Her A1C just came back still in range but I tested her ketones this morning and she has small amounts.\u00a0\u00a0Am I missing something here? She is still all over the place with her numbers.\u00a0\u00a0I am as confused as ever.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for all of the responses. :)Oh btw I am going to read that book thanks for the suggestion",

            "answer": "Hi,the A1C is a measure of average blood glucose over a 3 month period.\u00a0\u00a0As type 1 diabetes can develop very quickly the initial A1C will not reflect it.What was the actual value.\u00a0\u00a0A really nromal A1C is in the range of 4.1 - 4.6.\u00a0\u00a0If her A1C was over 5 it is actually abnormal.The keytones in the urine is concerning, it means that she is breaking down fat becuase her body can't use the glucose.I think you really need to see her pediatrician again / pediatric endocrinologist urgently to present her numbers and what is happening.If the diabetes is rapidly worsening your baby is at risk of ketoacidosis.\u00a0\u00a0If you test her sugars and they are over 300, if she is dehydrated / vomitting, please take her straight to the emergency room.\u00a0\u00a0Please also look up ketoacidosis and the symptoms so that you can react quickly if it does develop.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes can be really dangerous.",

    "question": "My daughter was experiencing some symptoms of hypo so her doctor sent her home with a script for a meter and strips.\u00a0\u00a0He also ran some blood tests and an A1C that I am waiting for the results on.\u00a0\u00a0Her BS is all over the place even after putting her on a low sugar high protein diet.\u00a0\u00a0She had 2 good days of numbers then this morning she woke up with her hypo symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0She gets sweaty, whines, cries, shakes, turns pale, even wakes up with nightmares when the symptoms start.\u00a0\u00a0I checked her first thing and it was 52, so I got her food and juice.\u00a0\u00a0Two hours later it was 171.\u00a0\u00a0Then before lunch she was 76 and two hours later it was 140.\u00a0\u00a0She has episodes of shaking, sweating, pasty face, crying, and being unresponsive especially when her BS goes to 300+ (which happens a lot).\u00a0\u00a0Then she can be 107 before dinner and 69 two hours later.\u00a0\u00a0This is on going and I cannot seem to get a grasp on it.\u00a0\u00a0She has a good diet and is a runner obviously being young and has definitely lost a little weight being that she was almost 40 pounds now down to 34 - 35 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0But her numbers especially since I graph it too I am able to see a roller coaster not a steady set for up and down on a daily basis.\u00a0\u00a0For her when I see her between 80 - 100 she feels great.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor mentioned that she is hypersensitive and that everything could be affecting her and causing the roller coaster but he needed to investigate further. Yesterday she told me she is always thirsty and is always starving.\u00a0\u00a0Even 30 minutes after her dinner she is saying she starving but she has a small appetite where as she used to be an eater.\u00a0\u00a0I am just baffled by her.\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound like she is having diabetic symptoms?",
