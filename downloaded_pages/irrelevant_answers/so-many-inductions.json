            "answer": "No no medical reasons for me. Just baby is big and don't want for the baby to get bigger. I'll get enduce at 39 which is already full term. Had 2 other inductions at 37 for medical reasons and no they were not more painful. Well one wa more then the other but the last one was so easy barely any pain at all. And I prefer for the baby to not get any bigger as I am a small person. My doc recommended it and I agree with him.",

My doctor won't even consider inducing until it goes past 41 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0In my Birthing class they were talking about how inducing can be more painful and potentially cause complications. I'm not trying to judge just curious.",
