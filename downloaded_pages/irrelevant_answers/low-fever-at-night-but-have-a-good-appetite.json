            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Discuss this with your doctor. Post noon increase your water intake as poor fluid intake during the day can increase the evening temperature. Mild tiredness, fatigue, working in a hot environment can all raise the temperature in the evening. Anemia, diabetes and thyroid problems can also mildly increase the evening temperature. Normally if you do not have any symptoms, it should be fine. However do discuss with your PCP once.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "HiYes, poor sleep and resultant exhaustion can mildly raise the temperature of the body. Try to sleep early. Take a walk or do some exercise before bed time, take a bath before bedtime and hopefully this will make a difference. Take plenty of fluids throughout the day.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
