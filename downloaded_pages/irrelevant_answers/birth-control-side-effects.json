            "answer": "Hmmm. I am also on Orth Tricyclen Lo, and I have notice that I tend to get more pins-and-needles when I sit weirdly. It may be the birth control that is causing it, because BC can affect blood pressure sometimes, or it could be the anxiety - I have panic attacks, too.Sorry I couldn't be of more help X___X\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't sound particularly severe, but you may want to bring it up with your doctor.",

            "answer": "Hi!I just went off of Ortho Tri Cyclene.\u00a0\u00a0The OBGYN doctor SWORE it was panic attacks and not the Pill.\u00a0\u00a0I am 35 and in excellent shape, run over 5 miles, and eat well, don't smoke, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I was on this same Pill since I was 18 on and off and recently back on it for the past 3.5 years.\u00a0\u00a0Out of nowhere I was calling 911 thinking I had a heart attack or stroke based on my symptoms (chest pain, numbness, breathing problems, rapid heart rate with palpitations).\u00a0\u00a0Then the same thing happened just sitting down a month later again and I went straight to the emergency room.\u00a0\u00a0When THEY said it was nothing and tried to give me xanax I knew I had to do something on my own because I won't use anxiety drugs unless it is an absolute LAST resort.\u00a0\u00a0I also found a doctor to get EVERY blood test done you can think of\u00a0\u00a0and she sent me to a cardiologist who did a hlater monitor and also cardiogram.\u00a0\u00a0They found nothing, just that I was in great health.I have never been to a doctor more than once a year and because of this I have been over 5 times in just a few months so I decided to visit with the OB again and go off the Pill.\u00a0\u00a0He said to go off of it but it was almost impossible it could be the Pill.Guess what?\u00a0\u00a0All symptoms have stopped completely.Check out this link on this same forum:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/4614Several of us wrote to Oprah (Dr. Oz) to try and get this out nationally because it seems a LOT of women are having the same symptoms and for some reason doctors seem to just want to put us all on anxiety drugs with no further testing.You can find where to put your story here:https://www.oprah.com/plugform.jsp?plugId=697&referer=http://www.oprah.com/contributor/health/drozHopefully, if there are enough of us someone could help figure out why so many women are having the same symptoms.",

    "question": "Hi everyoneI'm 21 years old and in good health. Late June I had emergency surgery to remove an ovarian cyst that had ruptured. I also found out that I have slight endometriosis. My doctor put me on ortho tri cyclen lo. I started this in July.Starting in October I started experiencing slight tingling in both feet and hands. It seems to be getting better but it is still there. It is more annoying than anything. Also I experienced my first panic attack before the tingling...anxiety runs in my family. I don't feel too much stress than normal but I am still feeling the tingling. I dont have diabetes or a thyriod problem although this also runs in my family.My question is could my birth control be causing this? I've been on it for about 4 months. Any thoughts would be appreciated. I also have no dizziness, balance, or speech problems.Thanks",
