            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If no neurological cause for pain in the arm is found like a pinched nerve, get a color dopplar to rule out a clot in blood vessel (either thrombophlebitis or deep vein thrombosis). It can also be due to inflammation of the muscles or myositis. Other than that, get a nerve conduction velocity test to know if there is any nerve compression. Metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism and low calcium could also be a cause and hence get this checked. Hope this helps. Take care!",
