I take 150mg Imuran daily and 250mg chloroquine ( I was on hydroxychloroquine for 6 years before switching to chloroquine).\u00a0\u00a0The chemo (Imuran) made me very nauseous for the first several months but after I got adjusted then it only bothered me during the hot summer months if I was riding in a car.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on the Imuran for 9 years and for the most part it has worked great for me.\u00a0\u00a0I'm still always tired but the rashes, skin problems went away and the joint pains became bearable.",

            "answer": "I am reading your comments with great interest.\u00a0\u00a0I have Lupus (finally diagnosed in 2004) and am also diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I also have severe gastroparesis due to the Diabetes and am currently awaiting approval for a gastric pacemaker implant, but the surgeon is very concerned about my immune system due to the fact that I am on Prednisone.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on the steroid since my diagnosis and although we have tried weaning me off of it, I can not function without it.\u00a0\u00a0I have had pericarditis three times in the past year due to the Lupus and the treatment for that is prednisone so its been a losing battle.\u00a0\u00a0I have a picc line in right now and can only take a liquid diet and all IV meds because of the gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0I was put on Plaquenil as well in the very early stages of my diagnosis and was taken off of it (don't remember why).\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know if the Plaquenil is less debilitating to the immune system and the ability for the body to heal?\u00a0\u00a0I have also been told that Cytoxan may be used in the future.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone out there have any information on Cytoxan??\u00a0\u00a0I'd be interested in hearing more about the Imuran also. Any information you can give me I would appreciate.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to see my doctor next week and it would be nice to go armed with some information.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks and everyone please take care!!",
