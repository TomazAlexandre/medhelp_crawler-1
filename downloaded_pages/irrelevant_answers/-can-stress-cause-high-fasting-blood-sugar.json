For a list of labs and kits and what HbA they can test go here. On the left click on HbA1c Test Methods...\u00a0\u00a0http://www.ngsp.org/prog/index.htmlI found other meters with unknown reliability and quality at lower prices.\u00a0\u00a0But, I tend to shy away from health equipment that are not tested to see if they meet standards.Amazon has the Bayer A1cNOW http://tinyurl.com/a1ctesterAlso found at Wal-Mart and Walgreens.This site has 39 reviews on the Bayer A1cNOW both positive AND negative. http://tinyurl.com/bayerreviews",
