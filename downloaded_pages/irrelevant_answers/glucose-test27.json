            "answer": "It's just to make sure you don't have gestational diabetes! No big deal! You'll want to go in the morning because you can't eat or drink anything 2 hours prior to them taking your blood. When you go in they will have you drink this orange drink that's basically like flat orange soda then you'll have to wait one hour before they will draw your blood. I would suggest not eating a lot of sugary stuff that day before you go in because it might effect your test results! Good luck",

With my last pregnancy I forgot and drank a pepsi before the test and still passed. I had a friend that did fast and failed the 1 hour and had to do the 3 hour test.",
