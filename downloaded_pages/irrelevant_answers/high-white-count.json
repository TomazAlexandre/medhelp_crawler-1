Your neutrophils ( a type of white blood cell) is usually associated with the acute or early phase of an infection or inflammatory process.Your test shows that the neutrophils predominate. An acute inflammatory and infectious process has to be ruled out. Are there any palpable masses in the body? any vomiting or back tenderness? Fever is sually associated with an ongoing infection.A peripheral blood smear is usually requested to visualize blood cell morphology and may shed some light.Associated weight loss, headaches, blurring of vision, easy bruising and appearance of lumps in the body may signal a more serious underlying condition.Please stay calm and wait for your physician to further evaluate you.Good Luck!",
