            "answer": "Well, off hand, I would say that a call to a local nutritionist would be in order she/he will be able to give you the right list of foods and how much to eat, etc. Some hospitals have one or two on staff and they are available to help, especially if the doctor writes a prescription to see one.Also, try doing a \"google\" search, there are all kinds of sites on what to eat and what not too.",

            "answer": "The above post is obviously correct -- you need to see a nutritionist.\u00a0\u00a0I'd suggest a holistic one rather than a highly degreed dietician, but that's up to you.\u00a0\u00a0But the truth is, you can still eat most of what was best for you to eat in the first place.\u00a0\u00a0What you have to avoid is what wasn't good to eat and got you into this situation.\u00a0\u00a0So don't despair, there's a lot of foods in the world, and most are still available to you.",
