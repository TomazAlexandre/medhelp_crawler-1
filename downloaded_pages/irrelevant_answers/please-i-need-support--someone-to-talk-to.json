            "answer": "hi jazzy, sometimes pcos is not even genetic. well in my case it isnt. nobody on both my mum or dad's side of the family has ever had any problems with their periods but low and behold i have it. i have always had heavy periods and have gone to a gynae,but it took me having a teratoma (demoid cyst) removed for them to realise i have pcos.yes it is painful especially when u menstruate but u can survive it. get checked up by a gynaecologist, they will put u on birth control but u need to exercise, eat correctly. its very easy to develop other problems with pcos, like diabetes, cholestrol problems, high blood pressure and stuff. the key is health diet. you will b fine, will b praying for you, God bless you",
