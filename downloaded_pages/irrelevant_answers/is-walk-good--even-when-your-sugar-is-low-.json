            "answer": "You should never exercise with low blood sugars - this includes walking. Test and make sure you're at normal levels before walking. Walking is a very good form of exercise. If you have Type 1 diabetes, you may need less insulin or more food or both when you exercise. Trial and error over time will help you determine what insulin or food changes your body will need for safe blood sugar levels during exercise. Never go walking with low blood sugars, you could feel unsteady or have trouble walking causing a fall. HTH",
