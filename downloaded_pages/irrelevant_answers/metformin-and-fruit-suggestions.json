            "answer": "Metformin should be taken with foods to \"help\" prevent nausea. One date is not enough food. Google search using the standard search term \"metformin vs xxxx\", where xxx is your other medication, to see if there are contraindications between them to cause your loss of appetite and/or nausea.Certain fruits contain high amounts of sugar. Go here for a list.\u00a0\u00a0http://nutrition.about.com/od/askyournutritionist/f/hi_sugar.htm\u00a0\u00a0Test your glucose level 2 hrs after consumption to see if you can handle specific fruits. I, for one, can eat melons and berries, no other fruit.",

            "answer": "I understand, some people just aren't pill swallowers.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure one date morning and evening is fine.\u00a0\u00a0Three dates are supposed to equal one exchange so that would be 5 grams of carbohydrate per date (I believe prunes are the same).\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure if type 2's need to be following the exchange diet, I am also a type 1 so I do, but it can't hurt\u00a0\u00a0if you are trying to keep your carb intake low.\u00a0\u00a0So, just make sure to count it into your carb allowance if you are following exchange lists (let me know if you don't know what I'm talking about and want some help with it or something).I am also on metformin, the same dose, but after awhile I seem to have gotten used to it and it no longer makes me sick unless I don't eat while taking it.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know how long you have been on it, but with time hopefully you'll begin to tolerate it better.\u00a0\u00a0I believe it will also help you with infertility won't it?\u00a0\u00a0I know it affect women's cycles because of the insulin resistance, which I have had issues with, but I've never looked into it too much since I don't plan on having kids.\u00a0\u00a0Just curious..Hope that helps :)",
