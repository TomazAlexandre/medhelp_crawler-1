            "answer": "Most endos, especially those managed by HMOs go the 6-9 week length. My new endo, who specializes in thyroid, not diabetes, goes 2-4 weeks and up to .25 increase per bump. I read Thyroid Power by Drs Richard and Karilee Shames, and they go every week if the patient takes each upgrade with ease.I have been handling two week bumps fine, but my thyroid just took a dump, so I dropped into hypo hell and I needed those bumps.The below site is where I found my endo. Make sure you ask the receptionist how many thyroid patients the doc sees. Mine sees 75 percent.http://www.thyroid-info.com/topdrs/:) Tamra",
