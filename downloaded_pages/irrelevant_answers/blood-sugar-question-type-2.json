            "answer": "Thanks a lot for the replies.I am in excellent shape and about 8-10% bodyfat.I eat a good diet 95% of the time and eat a lot of veggies,fish,avacados,nuts,seeds and things of this type.I am having a problem understanding the exact nature of my dysfunction as it relates to food,but I truly believe it is a carbohydrate metabolism dysfunction that needs to be treated.For example If I try to introduce a very small amount of carbs into my diet I notice bad side effects almost immediately.For example I will eat trail mix and add some prunes(20 Grams total carb in a 500 calorie meal)I notice I feel sleepy and my energy starts going way down and I start yawning.I know that the energy drop is normal if you eat a big meal with lots of carbs,but a small one with a small amount of carbs-this is a definite problem that is not normal.Fruit seems to be the worst food for me with reference to this problem.I can get away with a little low glycemic fruit(strawberries)-but things like pineapple of bananas forget it.Any further input is welcome.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks!",

    "question": "Hello everyone this is my first post-long time lurker(creepizoid).I am a 40 year old male,5ft7-150 lbs.My health is ok except for my crumbling body-arthritis,herditary periphral neuropathy,joint pain,dizziness etc etc.Now to the point.I have been watching my blood sugar for a long time and know that when I start eating any significant amount of carbs it will start that march upwards>>>higher and higher(I have never been diagnosed with any type of diabetes).I have a meter that I have compared with lab test readings and it is within about 5 %.When I start eating more carbs my fasting blood sugar will be from 100 to 140.Also I have a lot of other problems with increased carb intake such as I get very very very hungry all of the time,I get very thirst,frequent urination just to name a few.When I cut way back on my carbs my blood sugar will hang out in the high 90 to 115.I told my doctor this information and the fact that I was controlling my blood sugar by eating very low carb.He kind of looked at me like I was crazy and ordered a Hba1c,c peptide and blood sugar.It was all normal.THE PROBLEM IS I CAN CONTROL MY BS WITH LOW CARB BUT WHEN I START EATING MORE CARBS MY BS GOES WAY UP.I will give you a little scenario of what happened today with my blood sugar.I had dinner last night at 8 pm then could not eat until the next day after a med test @ 2pm.I finally ate at 2pm(was getting cranky)a large meal of chicken teriyaki and 3 large fried shrimp.To top that meal off I had a 2 scoop ice cream.An hour after that meal I checked my blood sugar for the next couple of hours and was pretty shocked. Here is my blood sugar readings:3pm-267\u00a0\u00a0 4pm-213\u00a0\u00a05pm-179\u00a0\u00a06pm-1187pm-70I feel that a very low carb diet is covering up possible type 2 diabetes,feel free to give your opinion it is much appreciated.",
