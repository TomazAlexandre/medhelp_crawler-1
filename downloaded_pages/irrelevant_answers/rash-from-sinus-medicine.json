            "answer": "Hi, symptoms are suggestive of drug allergy and are mediated by release of histamine in the body. Your body is known to hypersensitive to one of the drug present in medicines you have taken. You can be allergic to acetaminophen.Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, diclofenac, acetaminophen and ibuprofen, are associated with allergic adverse effects, ranging from mild rash to life-threatening allergic reactions. In such cases it becomes difficult to select appropriate pain killer.If drug allergy is suspected you need to discontinue the drug and report to your doctor immediately. Treatment includes anti histaminic and glucocorticoids against prescription. Even shot of adrenaline has to be given, when one is in anaphylactic shock. I suggest you to consult your doctor. Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "Am I right in assuming that you only took the med on 3/3/11?\u00a0\u00a0If so, 8 days is a LONG time to pass before an allergic reaction shows up.\u00a0\u00a0If you had taken the medication every day, it is possible to be an allergic reaction.And BTW - acetaminphen is not an NSAID.\u00a0\u00a0NSAIDs are COX-1 inhibitors.\u00a0\u00a0Acetaminphen is a COX-2 inhibitor.\u00a0\u00a0I am allergic to NSAIDs (asthma attacks) but can safely take acetaminphen.If you and your doctor do decide that you are allergic to ibuprophen it is best to avoid all NSIADs, but acetaminphen should be safe to take.",
