I made it to 38 weeks until I had to be on bed rest. I'll be 39 wreks tomorrow. Just keep your feet up when you can, drink water, and sit down as much as possible.",

            "answer": "I had threatened preeclampsia. My midwife put me on bed rest at 36 or 37 weeks because my job wasn't allowing me to drink much water and I had a lot of stairs leading to my office. If you are at risk, its better to play it safe and tell your doc. You need a bed rest request. If you don't want an emergency c section, you need to take it easy, drink lots of water, and rest with your feet elevated. Good luck and think positive thoughts!",
