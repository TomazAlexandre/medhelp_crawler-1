            "answer": "I am so very sorry to hear about your mother.There is no crystal ball for predicting how long any individual person will continue to live with End-Stage Liver Disease. As the liver fails other body systems also begin to fail and it is usually these complications (one being the hepatic encephalopathy you mention) which are ultimately fatal. Everyone is different and their particular circumstance is different. I would suggest speaking with the hospice care people who will be overseeing her care. They will be most aware of her health status as it varies day to day.Again, I am very sorry.My best wishes to your mother and yourself.Hector",
