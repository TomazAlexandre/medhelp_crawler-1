            "answer": "i agree with everyone else.\u00a0\u00a0thats definitely too long to wait.\u00a0\u00a0the first trimester is the most important in the growth and development of your baby.\u00a0\u00a0Check into Planned Parenthood's around where you are, but you definitely need to see someone.\u00a0\u00a0There are certain tests that doctors need to run to check on the health of your baby that need done between certain weeks of pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0waiting till 17 weeks would surpass some of those very important tests.\u00a0\u00a0I doubt you'll find anyone who will give you the advice that it's okay to wait.\u00a0\u00a0Some women can develop pre-eclampsia which is high blood pressure which puts mother AND child at risk, gestational diabetes, etc., and on and on.\u00a0\u00a0There are way too many things that can go wrong that can put yours and your baby's health at risk to wait.If worse came to worst, the least you should do is TODAY go to Walmart and get some over the counter pre-natal vitamins and begin taking those.",
