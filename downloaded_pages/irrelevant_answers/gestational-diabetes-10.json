Also watch your fruit intake because those are carbs. Basically my day consists of: wake up and prick myself to check my fasting sugar level, eat two eggs and half an english muffin, prick myself 2 hours after breakfast, eat a snack which is a small apple and cheese or half a banana and peanut butter. Then lunch ill make a sandwich with turkey, cheese, lots of lettuce, tomatoes and whole wheat bread. Have a glass of milk as well. 2 hours after lunch ill prick myself again. Basically you always need to eat a protein if you are going to have a carb.",
