            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!A high RDW and low MCV is seen in iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. A high RDW and normal MCV is seen in Vit B12 and folic deficiency. A high RBC count could be due to high demand as in anemia or due to polycythemia.You should repeat the tests after a week. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral to a hematologist.Hope this helps. Take care!",

            "answer": "I am surprised your labs are not worse than they are.\u00a0\u00a0Between the Lupus, RA, Mitochrondrial Disease, stomach ulcers, and Thalasemia Minor it is difficult to say which is causing the abnormal lab counts and the other question is maybe this your baseline; normal for you (related to the multiple diagnoses).Have the labs repeated in a week, and if they are the same or worse, consult a Hematologist, especially with all you have going on.",
