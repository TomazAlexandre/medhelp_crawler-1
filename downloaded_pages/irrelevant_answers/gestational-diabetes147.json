The only thing I will say is bring something to entertain yourself with as I had to wait at the doctors the whole time I was incredibly bored. Also make sure you are wearing comfortable clothing and maybe bring a small pillow as again I had to wait in the doctors the whole time and I was extremely uncomfortable.",
