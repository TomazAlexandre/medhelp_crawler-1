            "answer": "Please please go back to your vet. If there has been an infection in the uterus, more than likely this was what is known as \"Pyometra\" and that is why (presumably) your dog was spayed? Because the uterus had to be removed as it was infected? Have I got that right?What happens with Pyometra is the uterus swells up with fluid and pus, and as soon as it starts doing that toxins start to pass into the bloodstream, and can affect kidney function, and can lead to diabetes insipidus, as well.The very best way to deal with this is as a dire emergency. Waste no time at all in getting to the vet!The dog needs an IV line in as soon as possible, with fluids and antibiotics, then if response is good, surgery can be performed (otherwise the kidneys may not be even up to the surgery!)Afterwards very often (if the problem has been caught very very quickly and treated aggressively from the beginning) -the dog should make a good recovery.If there is vomiting like this after surgery it could be that the dog needs further IV fluids, and antibiotics. Or of course it can sometimes be a reaction to the anesthetic, though this is not frequently the case. If that is the case it should pass in half a day to a day, and anything more than that is cause for concern.It is always a good thing if there are any worries or symptoms after surgery to get straight back to the vet (or call the vet) and ask advice.",
