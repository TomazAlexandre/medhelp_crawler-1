            "answer": "I'm glad to hear that you'll be taking your dog to the vet.\u00a0\u00a0There are many things that could be going wrong at his age, and some pretty routine blood and urine tests should get you an answer.\u00a0\u00a0Since it sounds like he's got an upset tummy, you can try giving him a Pepcid or a Zantac tablet in the morning, and maybe even a Tums for good measure later in the day.\u00a0\u00a0Since he's lost his appetite, you'll probably have to pill him - just stuff it down his throat until it's past the point where his tongue rises against the roof of his mouth.\u00a0\u00a0If you're really quick, it shouldn't bother him a bit.You might call your vet today if they're open, and see if they'll do a payment plan or if they accept Care Credit.\u00a0\u00a0You can also go to the Care Credit web site and apply yourself.\u00a0\u00a0CC is a line of credit to be used only for medical bills for humans or animals.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you read the fine print, as I recall that any missed payments result in an outrageous interest increase.\u00a0\u00a0It's nice to know it's there in case of emergency though. :-)",

    "question": "We just recently noticed our 10 yr old german shepard is not really eating.\u00a0\u00a0I was albe to get him to eat last night by warming him up with some treats.\u00a0\u00a0Overall he is moving slowly (he has always been a bit lazy, but quick to respond to playing) he lags behind on walks and doesnlt seem to have many bowel movements.\u00a0\u00a0He is starting to look down his eyes are goopier than normal and he just doesn't seem interested in anything and looks to be having some trouble getting around.\u00a0\u00a0We plan to take him to the vet first thing Mon., but we don't have a alot of money to spend on him.\u00a0\u00a0I love him dearly, but unfortunately we need to take care of the reast of the family too on a very limited buget.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone have ideas on what I can do to ease his unhappines over the weekend and be able to afford the care he might need???\u00a0\u00a0Thanks......",
