            "answer": "I have been on Metformin for about 2 years straight. I too have the elevated LDL, insulin resistance, and pre-hypertensive. For a while the Met really did not do anything for me until after I had my miscarriage. I restarted the Met lost weight quicker and even started to have regular periods (about every 28-30 days). Oppose to before where I would have periods every 2-3 months that would last for weeks. Now I am so glad that they are regular. Met can have some side effects. The biggest is GI disturbances...diarhea definitely. Thats why people lose weight. Dry skin I'm not sure about, that seems more like a PCOS symptom. Kidney and back pain could come from hormonal imbalances. Intermittent cyst development can cause back pain too. You may want to check for fibroid development. But keep an eye out on that stuff. PCOS symptoms mask a lot of other disease development. Good Luck!",

    "question": "My testosterone level and triglycerides level are high. The doctor ordered glucose tolerance test and sure enough the results came back that I have insulin resistance. The doctor then put me on Metformin. I have been on Metformin for almost a year now and my dose was increased from 500mg to 1000mg a day. I am have several dry skin, my hair keeps falling off, and diarrhea. But one thing I don't understand is that since I have been on Metformin for so long, it does keep sort of regulate my period every month. But my testosterone and triglycerides are still high. Now, I have to deal with this sort of kidney pain and back pain everyday. Does anyone out there just like me? I am also hypothyroid. I am on Synthoid, Metformin and Lovaza (basic Omega-3 acid to help lower triglycerides.) If the medication does not lower my level, should I ask the doctor to look at other underlining causes?",
