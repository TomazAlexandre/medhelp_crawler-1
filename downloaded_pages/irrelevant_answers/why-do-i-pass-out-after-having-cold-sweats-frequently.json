            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you work standing or sitting at one position for too long, you could be having postural hypotension. The blood pressure falls when you stand and causes all the symptoms that you are suffering. Dehydration, certain medications, heart problems, untreated diabetes, and nervous system disorders can all cause this. TIAs or transient ischemic attacks can also be the cause. Certain internal ear problems can also affect blood pressure monitoring by the body by not properly signaling a change in position. Blood pressure monitoring, tilt table test, EKG, heart echo, ambulatory blood pressure recording are all required.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Cold sweats, especially on the firehead, which come on suddenly are hallmarks of cardiac ischemia. When the heart muscle is not getting enough oxygen, cold sweats break out quite suddenly. The characteristic of this phenomena is the sudden onset and the copius amount of sweat.Now there are other causes of cold sweats, but the juxtaposition of unconsciousness suggests a cardiogenic etiology.A full cardiac evaluation is in order.",
