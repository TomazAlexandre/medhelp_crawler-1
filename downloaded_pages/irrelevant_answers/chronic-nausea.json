            "answer": "Would he be headache free if he has a chronic subdural hematoma? He remembers afterthe ski accident he did not lose conciousness or have a headache. His only lasting symptom has been nausea which lead to rapid weight loss.After 20 months of feeling unwell I also think he has become somewhat agoraphobic, going out only to a limited few friends houses and avoiding restaurants, malls, movie theatres etc.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, without a headache, chances are less. Commonest cause of nausea is acidity. Liver and kidney dysfunction is another cause. Hence kidney and liver function tests should be done. Other causes are diabetes and hypothyroidism. Electrolyte imbalance too can cause nausea. See if all these have been looked into.Hope this helps. Take care!",

            "answer": "I am wondering if this resolved? My 18 yo son has had chronic nausea for 12 years. He had his left foot run over and hit the back of his head. This by an SUV. He was on foot. He started vomiting at the accident and then daily after eating for several years. We have also seen several Drs. He has gradually grown accustomed to feeling ill constantly, and still vomits often. I recently read that trauma can upset homeostasis in the abdomen and cause this to happen. It is extremely difficult to watch your child suffer like this, and not be able to help.",

    "question": "My son has suffered from chronic nausea for 20 months. He has seen Gastroenterologists, internists, psychiatrists and a cognitive behaviour therapist. He is currently taking Noritriptyline but is not experiencing any improvement.We thought he got sick after travelling to Ecuador in March 2008 with a parasitic infection. After so much time and no diagnosis I am owndering if we have missed the boat. He also had a skiing accident around the same time. He landed hard off a jump and flattened the soles of his feet requiring crutches for about a week. is it possible his problems could be caused by some ear problem?",
