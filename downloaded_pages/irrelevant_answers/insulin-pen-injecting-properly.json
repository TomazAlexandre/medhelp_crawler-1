            "answer": "Thanks Rob, that's a good idea and actually that's what I meant when I said I heard the clicking meaning that I could see the plunger going down, so I guess it's probably okay..but it still made me nervous.",

    "question": "Hello everyone,Recently I began using insulin pens after years of injecting with syringes.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate the convenience of the pen, but\u00a0\u00a0have had a few incidents that caused some concerns about the insulin actually injecting properly.I was told by my diabetes health staff that the way to verify that the insulin has injected properly is to\u00a0\u00a0look for\u00a0\u00a0a small drop of insulin on the tip of the needle after injecting.\u00a0\u00a0Now that I've done some research online, I see that many people recommend injecting a few units into the air first to make sure all is working fine before actually performing the real injection on myself.\u00a0\u00a0So, I'll definitely begin doing that as it seems like the best solution.I'm a bit worried though because this evening (before I read about testing a few units first) when I took my lantus injection (which was a brand new pen fresh out of the refridgerator), there was no insulin on the tip of the needle though I felt the units clicking when I pushed down to inject.\u00a0\u00a0Does it seem as if I didn't really inject since there was no insulin drop on the needle? Or might this be the result of a fresh new pen coming of the fridge? I\"m worried because I wouldn't want to take the injection again and accidently get a double dose of my large lantus injection.\u00a0\u00a0For now I'll just have to wait and see how my BS levels reflect tonight's incident.\u00a0\u00a0I was just curious if others had had similar experiences?Thanks everyone!",
