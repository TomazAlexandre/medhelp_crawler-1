    "question": "Hi, i'm 15 and even though i shouldn't be i am sexually active, i regularly have sex with my girlfriend, however one day when i had just \"gone in\" i realised a rather strange sensation, the head of my penis was so sensitive it really hurt and i had to pull out, a couple of hours later i got itchy so i scratched it and nothing happened! Admittedly i hadn't been washing my penis properly however when i pulled back my foreskin there was quite a bit of smegma(nob cheese)i washed it off and the itching died down, a few hours later it came back i pulled back my foreskin and yet again a substantial amount of smegma? Its getting annoying now and it woke me up this morning, does my family history of diabetes have anything to do with it? Was thinking it might be herpes but my girlfriend says she has no STD's of STI'sThanksP.S it does not burn when i urinate or burn at all",
