            "answer": "Try taking your mind off of your size, afterall, you are pregnant and you're suppose to look full and round. Try doing something around the house. Try shopping online or going out with friends or family. I'm sure your husband thinks you are beautiful. Many husbands find their pregnant wife to be beautiful and sexy.Why do you think you have gestational diabetes? Did you fail your 1 hour test? I did my 1 hour and failed. I did the 3 hour test and I haven't gotten a call from my doctor, so, so far it's good news, until Monday when I find out if I have it or not. Try not to worry about it. Your doctor will know how to take care of you and your baby if you do have gestational diabetes!!",

            "answer": "Thanks. I guess around now I need lots of hugs and physical affection but my hubby has never been that way so I feel it more now. And he is not so good at paying compliments...they mostly end up as backhanded compliments. Yeah, I failed my one hour test. My glucose was really high. I have my 3 hour test on Tuesday.",

You boost your confidence by your confession. I wouldn't let your husband should give you compliments or something. MEN!!!! They have no idea what we go through. You can always message me as well.",

    "question": "I've been feeling really down the past couple of days. Last week I was so excited about how full and round my tummy was getting and I was so excited to see myself looking like a pregnant lady. But this week I want to cry every time I pass a mirror. I feel hideous. It doesn't help that I feel like my husband thinks the same. I am worried that the blue days are going to get worse. I also found out today that I might have gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I am really worried. Can anybody realte or have any pointers to help get me out of my funk?",
