    "question": "Hello there, I recently found about this website and happy to be a part of it.I have Type1 Diabetes for 12 years and my eyes were -7.00 each myopia.I decided have a LASIK surgery 6 months ago and the doctors said everything was perfect and they could correct my vision %100 and my diabetes would not be a problem.But after the surgery I started to have more important problems than myopia and my myopia is not completely corrected. my right eye now has -2.00 astigmatism, it didn't have any before.I also have serious vision problems like Glare,Halos, starburst , serious night vision issues and dry eyes.I am very disappointed with my current vision and my doctor said that there was a problem with my eyes and it was mostly because of diabetes and it will not get any better.They recommended me a 2nd surgery with wavefront and told me that it might slighty improve my vision but there is no guarantee.I cannot do anything at night because of this because i can barely see anything at night. At daytime everything is so bright I cannot recognize people's faces.I'm also adding the scan results of my eye (I took the pic with my photo so quality may not be very good)Do you think should I take the risk and have the second operation or accept my current vision and live with it?Please help meThanks",
