            "answer": "Blood vessels of the brain shown in anatomy textbooks follow a nice symmetric pattern, connecting in a way that forms kind of a circle in the middle (Circle of Willis).\u00a0\u00a0However, in real life (or death really) - autopsy studies show that only about 25% of people really have blood vessels that look like what's in the textbooks.\u00a0\u00a0Your MRI shows that your blood vessels just connect in a different manner and it's just the way you were born and works for you. It's likely not to be clinically significant, unless you had significant stroke risk factors (heart disease, diabetes, cholesterol, smoking history, etc...) and had clogged arteries throughout your neck and brain. Otherwise, it's just a normal variant. Hope that helps.",
