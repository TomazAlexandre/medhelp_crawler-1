            "answer": "Diabetes is the one of the most mismanaged chronic diseases in this country and until very recently diabetes care in most hospitals had been abysmal. And I'm not limiting my statement to just small town hospitals. Large scale university affiliated teaching hospitals haven't done very well with diabetes either. Finally it seems as though this very serious problem is getting the type of attention that it deserves - people are waking up. But really, little would surprise me when it comes to diabetic care or the lack thereof.",
