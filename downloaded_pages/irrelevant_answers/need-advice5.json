            "answer": "FRANCES,\u00a0\u00a0If you feel faint again today, have someone take you to the ER.\u00a0\u00a0But could be almost anything doing this fainting feeling to you, which would include any excess weight you have, lack of exercise and extra weight, sugars all out of whack, and of course your blood pressure being too high or low.See, I am overweight, and because of injury disability, I really am not able to do much activity without a lot of pain, so I put on weight and I have to lay around a lot.\u00a0\u00a0So, whenever I simply get up and do something even minor in the house beyond going and coming, I become short of breath, feel kind of faint, and in general it scares the daylights out of me.\u00a0\u00a0But I also have panic disorder, which is one wild version of anxiety, but it's because my car wreck really did a number on my nerves.\u00a0\u00a0But despite my tranquilizers, then whenever I get faint like you, I get double scared.So, which comes first, the chicken or the egg?\u00a0\u00a0Which is to say, in our cases, which comes first, illness or anxiety?\u00a0\u00a0It's illness that causes sometimes a fainting sensation, and fear just naturally flows from that loss of control, which causes anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0So, unless you have a specific reason for anxiety, I think yours comes from your health issues.I WILL tell you this.\u00a0\u00a0I am very proud of you for visiting your doc tomorrow on the pre-diabetes thing, and I'm hoping any testing of your sugars was done properly, which I think includes a fast or something, but I don't know.\u00a0\u00a0Be proactive about that particular situation, just a little reading on diabetes so you can alert them to anything they should know, like the fainting.\u00a0\u00a0See, if your sugars get dangerously low, you can pass clean out and find yourself in a compromised situation... you may consider getting a little tag to wear that identifies you as pre-diabetic or whatever, so if you DO pass out, and someone finds you, they will perhaps be able to help you better until the EMT people arrive.\u00a0\u00a0By the by, you should carry a cell phone.Now, high blood pressure, that can make you just miserable in the mind, it can amp up your emotions to where you appear to be anxious, when all in the world that's going on is, your BP levels are not exactly right.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, you could ask your diabetes people about that tomorrow, COULD be they can get you squeezed into a BP appointment sooner rather than later, so you can maybe get a change in your medication to keep that BP straight.\u00a0\u00a0And this is another reason you should consider wearing a tag for THAT issue, too.\u00a0\u00a0By the way, Beta Blockers are good for blood pressure, and talk about feeling calm!\u00a0\u00a0I had to take them for a temporary hyperthyroid condition, and it slowed my heart AND made me feel calm as can be.\u00a0\u00a0Just a thought.I suppose I could go on and on about you, sorry.\u00a0\u00a0Now, hon, you CAN have BP trouble and diabetes WITHOUT extra weight, but IF your weight is goofed up, you must eventually get it off, and to keep it off you stay active as a lifelong habit, PLUS forever no fast foods, no regular sodas, a salad and glass of water with meals to make you feel fuller quicker, and, except for a bite of dark chocolate or a spoonful of ice cream, NO DESERTs.Well, if you have time and remember, let us know how things go for you.\u00a0\u00a0You may also wish to post over in the BP or Diabetes forums.\u00a0\u00a0And hey, if they think you are simply stressed, fine, go that route and tranqs will at least help you feel better (avoid SSRIs), but I do not think that is the CAUSE of your health issues.\u00a0\u00a0GG",

When I have a funny feeling and its ok.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't been having the faintish feeling issue-\u00a0\u00a0not sure if that's what I should of called it its more kinda like a lightheaded feeling.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't last for very long, real quickly.\u00a0\u00a0I had a bunch of test on heart an other things in 2007 and everything was good.\u00a0\u00a0So they said it was anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0I recently had a heart scan an my score was 0 they said I have no plaque or calcium build up.\u00a0\u00a0It's like a no win situation for me.When u say avoid ssri, what type of medication would I need??I also have an appt with a therapist tomm, feel like I may need it!",

            "answer": "Looks like I missed replying to you in time for your doc appointment.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore I really cannot comment on your question about the SSRIs in case they did indeed give them to you.\u00a0\u00a0They are for depression, sometimes anxiety too, and are a very powerful drug.\u00a0\u00a0As for what medicine you need, if you have anxiety, then normally tranquilizers are dispensed, which many are also very serious to use.\u00a0\u00a0You had said your docs thought you have anxiety, and that's why I talked about it so much, and those are meds that are often used for it.You had said in your original post you were going to visit a doc yesterday for pre-diabetes, and then you said in your second post you were going to visit a therapist yesterday (which implied to me a psych doc).\u00a0\u00a0Also, you did say you do have high blood pressure, as well as you have pre-diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0So, since I know that feeling faint can happen from either of those disorders, I told you to make sure your sugars and BP were okay, which in your second post you said you were okay.\u00a0\u00a0So, if they are indeed okay, I suppose something else is at work here.\u00a0\u00a0And that's why I brought up my weight being too high, because I'll get that same dizzy feeling as you and it's as a direct result of my not being active and being overweight.\u00a0\u00a0But you did not discuss that as a possibility, so I have to assume you don't have a weight problem, which by the way is very common with diabetes in particular, and often with blood pressure.You are not being paranoid about your health; you do have bonafide health issues.\u00a0\u00a0That's why it's so important to make real sure your health really is in order.\u00a0\u00a0As for just pure anxiety not brought on by any health issue, then anxiety can come from all sorts of things; with me, it was a car accident I was in that injured me very badly, so I have panic disorder.\u00a0\u00a0So, sometimes people will get anxious over something like that kind of as an undercurrent to their lives.\u00a0\u00a0Other reasons for temporary anxiety are things like dehydration, anemia, circulatory or pulmonary problems, recently losing a loved one, a change in location or job, the list goes on and on, which is why people go to a regular doctor to rule out physical problems that can cause it (anemia, pulmonary), or go to a psychiatrist when they wind up being told by a doc they have anxiety over more social issues (passing friend, changes).One thing I can tell you is this:\u00a0\u00a0If you find yourself feeling the way you did before, my advice remains the same, to go to the ER.\u00a0\u00a0But there is something else you can try, too.\u00a0\u00a0I do it all the time because of my panic disorder.\u00a0\u00a0I do very deep breathing, I breathe in really deeply, blow it out, breathe normal a few times, then deep breathe again, perhaps four or five times.\u00a0\u00a0This lowers the heartrate, which in turn lowers anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0Whenever I get nervous or feel strange in anyway, I do deep breathing, and it can get me through a rough patch.So, let us know how your doc appointments went, keep telling us how you feel, maybe someone else will chime in here with some tips, or I'll keep trying, too.",

            "answer": "I'm glad your visit went so well.\u00a0\u00a0But I'm sorry you have this unresolved anxiety issue that apparently makes you dizzy-like.\u00a0\u00a0You have lost some weight, so lose some more, the more you lose, the less likely you will get that sensation and possible sense of fear, and also as I said before do some deep breathing anytime that feeling comes over you, and if doesn't subside with that, go to the ER.\u00a0\u00a0Carrying around extra weight makes the heart work SO much harder, so could be periodically it'll be pumping hard because of whatever activity you're doing, and you'll get that dizzy-like feeling.\u00a0\u00a0So, as I just said, keeping working on getting the pounds off, I believe I told you what sorts of things will help with that.Another \"self-check\" you can do whenever you do your regular checks of where your sugars and BP are, is to check your pulse, just inside the wrist bone and before the tendons.\u00a0\u00a0If your heart rate goes over 100 beats per minute, BINGO, that's what is making you feel nervous.\u00a0\u00a0Could be a thyroid issue doing that, which is how come your doc checked your thyroid numbers.\u00a0\u00a0But if you do notice a fast heartrate a few times upon checking it, keep track of it in a little booklet along with your sugars and BP and weight, what you were doing and the time of day, that sort of thing, and then after a couple weeks of a fast heartrate, make arrangements to see your doc again and report this heartrate problem to him.That leaves how your bloodwork came out, whether you're anemic or whether you are perhaps low on a vew vitamins, like for example if you don't eat enough protein, you'll get a little dizzy sometimes.\u00a0\u00a0Look online for good protein foods that won't raise cholesterol.I take it your breathing is doing okay?\u00a0\u00a0If you have noticed you have a lot of asthma-like symptoms or get a lot of coughs or have bouts with pneumonia in the winter, you should mention this to your doc next time you see him.\u00a0\u00a0He will know that this could cause poor oxygenation of the blood, and that can make you feel dizzy, and it sort of opens the door to a few other avenues as to why you've been feeling a little strange of late.So, find out the results of your bloodwork, take your pulse whenever you feel dizzy, do some deep breathing when that happens, and if it sticks with you then go to the ER.\u00a0\u00a0Try eating more proteins and less carbs for a while, up your exercise gradually, get a fair amount of weight off whether you like it or not.\u00a0\u00a0Stay well-hydrated by drinking extra water as a routine, exercise regularly, keep track of any unusual things in some notes, and I really hope this dizzy stuff gradually goes away.",
