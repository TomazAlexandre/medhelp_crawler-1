            "answer": "Hello,It sounds like panic attack to me. A panic attack is a response of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The most common symptoms may include trembling, dyspnea (shortness of breath), heart palpitations, chest pain (or chest tightness), hot flashes, cold flashes, burning sensations (particularly in the facial or neck area), sweating, nausea, dizziness (or slight vertigo), light-headedness, hyperventilation, paresthesias (tingling sensations), sensations of choking or smothering.Stress is an important causing factor.During a panic attack, Breathe slowly through the nose using the diaphragm and abdomen. Do not breathe through the mouth. Talk with a supportive person if you are feeling stressed or anxious.Do not worry about the future and talk to your family if feeling anxious.Pls get yourself evaluated for diabetes ,thyroid disorders and heart valve disorders.Also take vit B supplements for some days.It might help.If the symptoms persist then pls consult a physician.You may need anti anxiety medicines.Severe cases may require Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",
