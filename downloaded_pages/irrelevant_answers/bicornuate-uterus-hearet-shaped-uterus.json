            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your losses. Whether the pregnancy will carry forward or not depends on the actual shape and space in the uterus. Hence this has to be assessed. It is also possible that cervix is weak. Hence, this will need careful monitoring all throughout.If you have first trimester abortions then other causes such as fetal abnormality, genetic causes, Rh blood group incompatibility, low progesterone hormone, infection of the uterus, endometriosis, fibroids etc need to be eliminated.If its second trimester abortion then other causes such as chromosomal abnormalities; infections like listeria, rickettsia, toxoplasma, mycoplasma, viral infections (herpes, rubella, CMV, HbAv), local infections (cervicitis, endometritis) and malaria; cervical dilatation; multiple pregnancies; leiomyomas, fibroids; diabetes; hypertension; smoking; renal diseases; polycystic ovary; hormonal disturbances; need to be ruled out.If the uterus is small and bicornuate, then chances of a full term pregnancy may be less. You need to consult a good infertility expert and get this evaluated. Take care!",
