            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!If you were taking the steroids for general fatigue body aches etc then you must look at the various causes for these symptoms like anemia, diabetes, thyroid problems, low protein, low iron, VitD or B deficiency etc.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor and also that you took the test and how you felt. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "I was taking decadron for a suppression test.\u00a0\u00a0I did suppress.\u00a0\u00a0However,\u00a0\u00a0a 24 hour urine cortisol was elevated as was the corticosteroid test.\u00a0\u00a0An MRI showed two hyper intense areas in the anterior portion; one just to the right of center and one to the left. The MRI report stated they could be a cyst or a micro adeoma. The report also stated I have inflammation near the left mastoid.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My endocrinologist does not think the pituitary \"lesions\" are of significance.\u00a0\u00a0I have not even thought about the mastoid problem and don't know where to start. Serum cortisol was normal as was DHEA.\u00a0\u00a0The blood tests also revealed elevated RDW and low iron saturation.\u00a0\u00a0I should add I have inherited thrombophilia and am on blood thinners after two bouts of DVTS and pulmonary emboli.",

    "question": "I was very concerned about taking decadron for the suppression test, but I figured I needed an answer and in spite of my apprehension I started the doses. By the 7th dose .5 every 6 hours for 48 hours, I was feeling great. No more aches, I felt I could breath better and I had more energy than I have had in a long time.\u00a0\u00a0It is now the 2nd day of no dose and I'm starting to get achy, neck and lower back pain, and breathing is OK.\u00a0\u00a0Why was I feeling so much better?\u00a0\u00a0Is this significant? Should I tell my Doctor?",
