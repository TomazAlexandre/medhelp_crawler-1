    "question": "I have been diagnosed with a blood clot that was pushing on my optic nerve.At the three month check-up my opthalmogist informed me that the clot is just sitting there, and that there was nothing that can be done about it. The pressure in my eye is over 20 and i have been prescibed Xalatan which has lowered the pressure slightly.Also the circualtion in the eye area is sluggish.The vision is slighty blurry, since I went to the opthalmologst last week it has improved slightly.\u00a0\u00a0Has any one else got this problem? Would it be safe to take either cartia asprin or ginkgo to help the clot to break up.I am really worried that the clot could cause me to loose the sight in my eye.Thank you",
