            "answer": "I tried but couldnt find your last post. But, I can assure you thst my anxiety is as bad or almost as\u00a0\u00a0bad or worse than yours is. I have this HORRIBLE fear of diabetes and sugar, and am only 13. EVERY SINGLE MOMENT I am thinking bout it and biting my nails and trembling outta fear and anxiety. I went to the doctor and they told me I was physically fine, but said I was getting bad anxiety. When I get anxiety I get dry mouth, I lose my appetite, I tend to lose sense of what goes on around me, I sweat A LOT, and my heart beats like crazy. I have gone to a therapist, and I have gotten better a little, but then I went back to where I started! You are not alone.",
