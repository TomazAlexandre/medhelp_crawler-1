            "answer": "I was in the mid stages of dementia and have permanent nerve damage and my B12 serum was 165pg/mL. Suffice to say the B12 serum reference ranges your lab has listed are absurd and that is an understatement.\u00a0\u00a0Your B12 result of 517pg/mL would be classed as vitamin B12 deficiency in Europe and Japan. Labs start around the 550pg/mL range.\u00a0\u00a0I highly recommend sublingual B12 spray.ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) indirectly measures how much inflammation is in the body.\u00a0\u00a0It is a screening test and cannot be used to\u00a0\u00a0diagnose a specific disorder.\u00a0\u00a0Inflammation can occur with conditions such as anaemia, pregnancy, kidney disease, thyroid disease, Lupus, Rheumatoid arthritis, infections to name a few.The number of red blood cells are decreased in anaemia; bone marrow failure; haemorrhage (bleeding); malnutrition; erythropoietin deficiency (secondary to kidney disease); haemolysis due to transfusion; blood vessel injury, or other cause; leukemia; multiple myeloma; nutritional deficiencies of iron, copper, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin B6; hereditary anaemias, overhydration, pregnancy.",

            "answer": "The first result has to do with how well your kidneys are functioning.\u00a0\u00a0GFR stands for glomerular filtration rate.\u00a0\u00a0Yours is above 60, which means your kidneys are not failing basically.Your result for vitamin B12 is in normal range.\u00a0\u00a0If you've been tired, the doctor may have tested that to see if it came back low, which can be a cause of tiredenss.\u00a0\u00a0But it did not.The pituitary hormone that helps to regulate your thyroid function, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is right within normal range, as is your thyroid hormone, free T4 that they measured.Your RBC is your red blood count and it came back in normal range.The sedimentation rate, also known as ESR or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, is a nonspecific disease indicator, particularly of conditions of inflammation.\u00a0\u00a0Taber's medical dictionary (and I've had a doctor who felt the same way about it) doesn't think it is a screening that is useful.\u00a0\u00a0There was a doctor who said if you had a hangnail, your ESR could go up!That said, your sedimentation number looks to be outside the normal range for outpatients.\u00a0\u00a0Taber's says an elevation of the sedimentation rate that is not explained most often is transitory and serious disease is rarely the cause.Have they done an MRI of your brain and or spine in checking for MS yet?\u00a0\u00a0Also, I don't see the result in testing for Lyme's?\u00a0\u00a0See PM for more info on Lyme's diagnosing.",

            "answer": "Well, just to be on the side of caution, your doctor may want to order an HgA1c to get a bigger picture.\u00a0\u00a0I don't believe your blood sugar number in that instance even falls into the criteria of pre-diabetes, but the HgA1c would tell more about how you're doing.\u00a0\u00a0Peripheral neuropathy is a common problem in those with diabetes, so if you have the neuropathy, they might have been testing your blod sugar to try to rule diabetes out.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, it's a common test in general, even if you aren't having a bunch of alarming symptoms such as peripheral neuropathy that might make a doctor want to rule diabetes out.One website says there is no definitive blood test for MS (see PM).\u00a0\u00a0Another mentions blood tests as part of the diagnostic work-up, but doesn't spell out what they are.\u00a0\u00a0They do mention vitamin deficiencies can mimic MS, so your vit. B tests that you got may have been checking up on that angle. (See PM for more info.)Also, you might find a lot of people on the following medhelp forum who can give advice and guidance regarding MS:http://www.medhelp.org/forums/Multiple-Sclerosis/show/41",
