            "answer": "I as well.\u00a0\u00a0I am diabetic 2.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor said it was from poor circulation.\u00a0\u00a0If it hasn't yet, it will progress to extreme itching, and the itching may include rashes on other parts of the body.\u00a0\u00a0I find that too much sugar and stress and lack of exercise increases the problem to a much higher degree. When I say too much sugar, it does not mean candy and cake.\u00a0\u00a0It means as well, too many potatoes, pasta, pizza, cokes, baked caseroles.\u00a0\u00a0Stress includes co-workers, family discord, and no exercise.The poor circulation is a result of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Swelling may be increased with too much salt.\u00a0\u00a0While I know some of the answers, I still have the problem.\u00a0\u00a0It is harder to apply your own advice.\u00a0\u00a0All of our foods are either alkaline or acidic.\u00a0\u00a0Our body's PH level is slightly alkaline, with a normal range of 7.36to 7.44, and our diet should reflect this and also be slightly alkaline.\u00a0\u00a0An imbalanced diet high in acidic foods such as animal protein, sugar, caffeine, and processed foods tends to disrupt this balance.\u00a0\u00a0It can deplete the body of alkaline minerals such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, zinc, chromium, and other minerals.A diabetic is usually out of balance and very low on the required minerals.\u00a0\u00a0Nearly without question, all diabetics are\u00a0\u00a0definately low on chromium, actually the entire population is.\u00a0\u00a0As you get older, you seem to get less and less minerals.\u00a0\u00a0So again, a healthy balance of eating is necessary.\u00a0\u00a0Here is a sugesstion:\u00a0\u00a01/3 plate vegetables (not potatoes,corn,peas); 1/4 protein; 1/4 pasta.\u00a0\u00a0I would also suggest a special diabetic supplement containing those minerals - not a regular vitiam and mineral pill, but one developed expecially for diabetic.I need to follow my own advice better.Yumdi",
