    "question": "I was just diagnosed with PCOS a month and a half ago. There is a strong history of diabetes in my family and I have had regular bloodwork done to ensure I dont have it. Within the last two years I have gained about 40lbs, even tho my eating hasn't changed. Since being diagnosed I have started taking a half tablet of phentermine to control my appetite in an effort to lose weight. I also started taking birth control again. My doctor also prescribed taking metformin(glucophage) in addition to the phentermine and birth control. I have lost about 8 pounds in the last month since taking the phentermine but i dont feel like I am losing enough weight for how little i have been eating. My question is whether it would be smart to keep taking phentermine and adding the metformin also",
