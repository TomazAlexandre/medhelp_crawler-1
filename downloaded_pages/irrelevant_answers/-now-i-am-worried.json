            "answer": "That's why it's important to have the testing done. Since you got your diagnosis early enough to make changes, you're keeping it well controlled and staying active, you're not likely to have a baby that's much bigger than normal. Remember of course that the range of what's \"normal\" is pretty big... but you're doing the right things. Keep it up and everything is gonna work out okay.",
