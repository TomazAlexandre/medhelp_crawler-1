            "answer": "So Sorry to hear about your dog....it must be difficult for you to watch him bumping into things.Besides diabetes...I know that high blood pressure might cause the blindness, and also there is a condition called SARDS. Sudden Acquired Retinal Degeneration Syndrome....I don't know much about it, except it will typically affect older dogs.It is something you can look up on the internet while you wait for your dogs lab work to come back.....Best Wishes for you and your dog....let us know what you find out.Connie",

            "answer": "You could ask your vet for a referral to a Veterinary Opthalmologist.It's strange that the blindness should come on so dramatically and suddenly like that, if you hadn't noticed any changes in your dog's sight before Friday...It is true that dogs can adapt very well to blindness, but it takes a little working together to perfect the routines. Then the dog can live a perfectly happy life with adaptations in his environment.But it would be wise to know if this was a symptom of another condition or not...and also if it is reversible of course.",

            "answer": "Thank you everyone for your supportive messages. We have got the results back and all of his organs are working fine and his health is apparently very good for an elderly dog.I think we will look into the diabetes side of this, but we will update you all on his progress if there is any sudden change. He already is seeming to begin to adapt to it, and i am planning to take him just outside the garden tomorow.Its a relief that we are not going to lose him yet, especially as it would be traumatic for all the family.Many thanks all",

We are now sadly seriously considering his quality of life, as the vet says she is suprised how quickly it has proggressed(suspecting a brain tumour). I feel he has had a good life, and we are making him as comfortable as possible.I feel i can speak my hearts to you all, so thank you for listening",

He had had another seizure yesterday afternoon, which was a lot worse than before, and horrid to witness, so we decided it was the kindess thing we could do for him.I have even greater empathy for others who have lost beloved pets(especially dogs) and it is truly like losing a very close relative.Thankyou for your kind thoughts and wishes.",

    "question": "Our 13 year old collie has become very withdrawn and quiet since friday afternoon and seems to have gone suddenly blind. He relies on his scent more than anything now and has very rarely wags his tail. He seems to not look at me and instead looks off to the side. Sadly he also keeps walking into kitchen cabinets and the shed outside as if he CANNOT SEE.We took him to the vets that day and he had a blood test done aswell as the retraction in his pupils tested- one pupil doesnt retract at all. We get the results on monday but I was wondering whether anyone can give me any info on what can cause this very sudden and distressful change in sight.P.S he was absolutley fine on friday morningMAny thanks",
