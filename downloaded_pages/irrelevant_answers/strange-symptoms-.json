            "answer": "Hi,of course you didn't do it for nothing!\u00a0\u00a0It is far better to be a healthy weight than overweight and you look better and surely feel better than you did at 236.\u00a0\u00a0Are you able to exercise?\u00a0\u00a0This will also help. Don't get too hung up on the BMI, it doesn't take account of muscle mass.It is however, still possible that you have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Have you seen your doctor?\u00a0\u00a0Do you monitor your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0You need to monitor blood sugar and get your HA1c tested - this will tell average blood sugars over the past few months.\u00a0\u00a0If you do have diabetes will be much easier to manage if you have normal weight and with the good eating habits you have now.Learn as much as you can.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is definitely manageable and knowledge is power.Best wishes and ask any more questions you have.",

            "answer": "I agree with what the two posters above said. In addition I found it strange that with a fasting blood sugar of 150 you were told you were \"borderline diabetes\" (the correct term is pre-diabetic). Anything over 126 fasting is considered diabetes. You definitely need more testing. Keep up the good work on the weight control. Some people can control diabetes for awhile with just diet and exercise and weight management, but it is a progressive disease and you may need more help.",
