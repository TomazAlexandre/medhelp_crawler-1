            "answer": "I work at a assistent living place. Some of the little old ladies keep their appartment unbearably hot during the summer. Since I have been pregnant I feel light headed when I get too warm or in tight areas. Never had that problem before. My doctor said this is not abnormal, but they did check my iron count and for gestational diabetes. I have taken her advice and make sure I drink lots of water in the morning and healthy snacks throughout the day. Haven't had a problem since.",
