            "answer": "Hi abebaby,I'm more familiar with Type 1 diabetes, as are most of the people here, because that's the focus of this forum. All I can say is that in the world of Type 1, your blood-sugar numbers are not high. I'm not sure what doctors look for with early-stage Type 2. If you're underweight and feel terrible all the time, you might not be getting enough to eat. You are to be commended for taking your genetic risk for Type 2 so seriously, but maybe you don't have to take it that seriously. My advice (and I am NOT a doctor!) would be to not starve yourself between now and June 20th-- see if eating a little more helps you feel better, so you have more information to give your doctor. Good luck with it.",

            "answer": "Most articles I have read don't consider glucose levels to be in the possibly diabetic range until they are above the mid 140's after a meal. Yours are absolutely perfect. Losing weight below your ideal weight is not the way to protect yourself. This is harmful for you and I would encourage you to instead eat a healthy diet and exercise to keep your weight ideal. Starvation is not the way to attain good health, and it is not necessary to do this to protect yourself from type 2 diabetes. As for your fasting being higher than it was the last time it was taken, this could be due to a number or reasons, including a meal the night before that had lots of carbs mixed with fat to delay digestion. Keep up the good weight and work some exercise into your life, and I would bet that you can increase your food intake so you feel better without altering your sugar levels.",
