            "answer": "Hi Element,Exubera would not likely give the delivery accuracy you need as a type 1, but since it has been pulled from the market this month due to lack of profitability, it does not matter.Smoking, however, is another issue. Forget cancer. It is the reduction of blood flow nicotine causes, coupled with the microvascular disease you most likely are already developing that will start to affect first your eyes (retinopathy) then your nerves (neuropathy). I finally quit smoking when the retinoathy I developed in my 20's progressed to take one eye and half the sight in the other. The smoking was a primary casue of it's progression. Smoking will hurt you, badly and soon. And there is no going back.Treat your diabetes with the respect it requires, and it will let you live a normal life. Cross it at your peril.Larry",
