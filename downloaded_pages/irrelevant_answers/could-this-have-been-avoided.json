            "answer": "IATROGENIC means;induced inadvertently by a physician or surgeon or by medical treatment or diagnostic proceduresI'm assuming that the problem you're talking about being avoided is the hyperthyroidism?\u00a0\u00a0TSH - 0.05 and 0.04???After you had your ablation for Graves disease in 2000 was their any thyroid function left?\u00a0\u00a0*IF* so..It could just be the Graves disease becoming more active.Because they've used the term 'Iatrogenic' I'm assuming that they are blaming it on too high a dose of your levoxyl.\u00a0\u00a0Dosing is very difficult - especially if you have a partially function thyroid gland after ablation.\u00a0\u00a0Getting the dosage right is the scourge of thyroid patient's lives - as you'd know.\u00a0\u00a0It is not an exact science so unfortunately these things happen sometimes - little concillation for you though, sorry...... although on the other hand....Was the infection you spoke of aquired in hospital or through medical treatment?\u00a0\u00a0I ask because if there is an outside chance if there is still function in your thyroid gland that an infection getting into the gland itself could have jump started higher function resulting in hyperthyroidism ie. your low TSHNot very likely though, but not impossible.Could this have been avoided?\u00a0\u00a0I daresay that all was done to try and avoid a situation such as this ie, regular blood testing and dosage adjustment of your levoxyl.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes no one can predict why/when these sort of things happen.\u00a0\u00a0I'm really sorry it happened to you - looks like you've had enough to deal with over the years.Just my personal opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Others may have a different take, hopefully you'll get more replies.",

            "answer": "I'm finding it difficult to read your posts because they are in CAPS - maybe you didn't know but in online terms it also means you are shouting.\u00a0\u00a0Could you please turn CAPS LOCK OFF?If Levoxyl was lowered sooner would your Graves have not re-activated?No one can really say with 100% certainty but it is highly highly unlikely - as there are many reasons why this may have happened.\u00a0\u00a0I don't personally have Graves but I have read many other people's posts who have had their Graves come up again even years after ablation, as in your case.It's more than likely that the Graves was stirring up by itself anyway.Dosage will always be adjusted to the current TSH level - no one can anticipate which direction the TSH will go in the future.If I had to say yes or no about the above question regarding lowering Levoxyl sooner - I would say NO I don't think it would have many any difference.\u00a0\u00a0BUT that is just my personal opinion.",
