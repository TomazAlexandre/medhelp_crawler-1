            "answer": "Hi,I can kind of relate - to the gestational diabetes part (@ 14weeks) but as I've been insulin resistant before pregnancy my Doctor at my first appt said I would never be allowed to go past my actual due date and unless I went into labour myself I would be induced in my 39th week....\u00a0\u00a0since that was before gd diagnosis I'm pretty sure they've bumped up my cut-off date I just have to trust that they know what they're doing and that they want the best possible outcome which is a baby that is alive and kicking at delivery.I never had a firm birth plan in mind so I can imagine you are disappointed that yours will not be how you imagined it but ultimately I would not want to risk stillbirth, and since they have to check for lung maturity I'm sure they'll leave him / her in until the lungs are good. I see you are referring to \"her\" I had read that girl's lungs mature faster than boys not sure how accurate that is.\u00a0\u00a0Also I think a lot of ladies on my pregnancy diabetes board are induced at 38 weeks.Good Luck, I hope everything works out closer to how you imagined it.J",

            "answer": "I think it is wise to follow your Dr's advice.\u00a0\u00a0 They do not routinely induce at 37 wks.It's about the benefits outweighing the risks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When pregnant with my son they hadplanned to do an amnio at 37 wks and induce if lungs were mature because I had many complications.\u00a0\u00a0 My son decided to come at 37 wks on his own- my water broke at4am.",

            "answer": "I also have gestational diabetes, and my doctor has told me to prepare for the same thing. But, honestly, I don't mind. I tend to have big babies, anyway, and that extra three weeks can make a HUGE difference. My son was born at 36.5 weeks and he was almost 9 pounds. If I had gone full-term he would have been at least 12 pounds. As it was, the birth was difficult and his shoulders got stuck. Babies born to mothers with GD tend to have large shoulders and there are many risks associated with going full-term. I understand your desire to let things happen naturally - especially since this is your first baby. But, in this case, I have to say that I would go with your MD's recommendation. The risks are just not worth it. As far as lung development, I wouldn't worry. Like I said, I was 36 weeks, 3 days when I had my son...his lungs were great, he was healthy, and he looked full-term. 37 weeks isn't considered premature or pre-term. Your baby will be healthy and beautiful! Don't worry!Tricia",

            "answer": "First off, I don't want to scare you by all means, I would listen to your doctor, this is what they do day in and day out.\u00a0\u00a0My friend was 38 and had controlled GD and lost her son to a still birth 8 months ago, she is still having such a hard time and she was 37 years old.\u00a0\u00a0I was 41 when I had my son and I had GD as well, I was scared out of my mind, I also took Glyburide once a day and had fetal monitoring and my doctor scheduled me for a induction at 38 weeks, believe me I did exactly what they wanted me to do and during active labor Gavin's heart rate was dropping really low ( not related to GD though), but the doctor wasn't that concerned because when the contraction ended his heart rate came back up to normal.\u00a0\u00a0I also opped to not have the amino at 20 weeks, but I had over 25 ultrasounds throughout my pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I did not want to risk the chance, especially after what my friend went through.\u00a0\u00a0I did whatever they wanted me to do to avoid a still birth.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure that is the most painful feeling in the world, going through labor and delivering a baby that is not alive.\u00a0\u00a0It's your call and decision and I hope you decide what is best for you and your unborn child.Debbie",

            "answer": "I had GD with my second.. took insulin for it was always well controlled.. never over on my sugars.\u00a0\u00a0I had non stress tests twice a week... all was well but too had an amnio at 37w for lung development and was induced the next day.\u00a0\u00a0she was 7lbs 8oz... I can't imagine how big she would have been if I had week 3 more weeks...\u00a0\u00a0I was happy that she was healthy and didn't mind being induced early... With my last pg I didn't have GD WOW I had it two times before with my first two pg and this time nothing.. I credit it to 4 years of low carb diet before pg and I had a vbac with her naturally 8 days early on her own.\u00a0\u00a0good luck and I would go for the induction...\u00a0\u00a0it is just safer if you look at the stats.. the still birth rate goes wayyyyyy up in the last 3 weeks",

            "answer": "Thans to everyone that responded.\u00a0\u00a0I was able to convince my doctor not to induce at 37 weeks. I asked for an ultrasound where they were able to look at the placenta. The deterioration of the placenta was the largest concern. She allowed me to push it off on an appointment to appointment basis.\u00a0\u00a0She did not want to go past 39 weeks. I was okay with that decision.\u00a0\u00a0Sarah was born on June 19, 2009.\u00a0\u00a0I had scheduled c-section at 39 weeks because she was breech.\u00a0\u00a0I was told in my childbirth class by a very good teacher to \"trust my motherly instincts\".\u00a0\u00a0That is the best advice that I have received and now give to others.\u00a0\u00a0Sarah was 5 lbs. 6 oz. and 17 1/2 inches long.\u00a0\u00a0She was perfectly healthy.\u00a0\u00a0She didn't have any problems, not even with her bilyrubin.\u00a0\u00a0I am very lucky.\u00a0\u00a0I could not imagine how small she would have been and what complications we may have had if she had been delivered 2 weeks prior.

    "question": "I have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes. I have recently found out that my doctor wants to induce me at 37 weeks. I am 35 weeks currently. I was told this one week ago. I was devestated. I really want my baby to come naturally, whenever she is ready. My blood sugar is under control. I do take a 2.5 mg Glyburide pill once a day and receive fetal monitoring twice a week. My blood sugars and fetal monitoring have all came out fine. My doctor says that even if they continue to come out fine, I will still be induced due to the increase risk of stillbirth. I have no complications. I didn't even have morning sickness. I have gained 21 lbs. There isn't a concern for her to be a large baby from her measurements. Most people can't even tell that I am pregnant. I haven't recieved an ultrasound since 20 weeks. Would you recommend that I get another ultrasound? I would like some statistical data on the increase of stillbirth in women with controlled gestational diabetes, especially in the last weeks. I have read that placental deterioration may occur. What are the chances if it is under control? Would you recommend that a patient in my condition be induced at 37 weeks? I will have an amniocentesis done first to check the lung maturation. I denied the recommended 20 week amniocentesis that is usually done to check for birth defects in women of advanced maternal age. I am 36 and this is my first baby. I am very healthy and have a job that keeps me active. I love being pregnant and really would like to go into labor when she wants to enter this world, not when her lungs are just mature enough. I would appreciate all of the information that you can give me. I am in a big dilema.Thank You",
