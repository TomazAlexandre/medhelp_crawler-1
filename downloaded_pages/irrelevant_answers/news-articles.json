            "answer": "I have read this article in several places and I am puzzled at the difference between the headline and the content. \"Direct cause\" seems to be an overstatement, if I am reading this article correctly (not the abstract, the article). Insulin resistance has been known to be an issue for a while and surely it can lead to diabetes. This is where many of the lifestyle choices come into play to avoid the consequences of insulin resistances. Add the high fat diet, and anyone is suceptible to diabetes, so this seems to be a preliminary mouse study that needs more investigation before a direct association is made in humans. I don't know, maybe I am just missing a key piece of this or something. It seems they are linking high fat diet and insulin resistance\u00a0\u00a0more than anything.And the second article is not very clear, either. Enbrel is an aniti-inflammatory and the folks at Amgen told me a couple of years ago that they had found some histological improvement with Enbrel in those with hepatitis C, independently of interferon therapy. This is very exerimental at this point and I don't know whether Amgen has made a committment to this research yet.Enbrel has some serious side effects of its own (it is an injectable) and using it in combination with interferon, especially where autoimmune disorders are present, is highly controversial. That may be difficult to get by an Investigational Review Board (IRB) We'll see.thanbey",
