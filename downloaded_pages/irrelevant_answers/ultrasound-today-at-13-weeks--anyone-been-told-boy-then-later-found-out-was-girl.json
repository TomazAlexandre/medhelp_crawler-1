    "question": "Hi everyone! So I had an ultrasound today at 13 weeks and the tech told me it looked like a boy and she would be shocked if it turned out to be a girl.. then doctor said boy as well. But I heard the genitals are swollen at 3 months so its hard to distinguish a boy and girl. Yet my ultrasound pic deff looked like a boy. So has anyone ever had that happen where they were told in an early ultrasound they were likely having a boy and later found out it was a girl?",
