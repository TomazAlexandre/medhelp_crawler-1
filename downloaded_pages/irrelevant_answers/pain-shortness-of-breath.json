            "answer": "Hi!Yes, muscle pains and cramps along with shortness of breath can be due to fentanyl. However chest pain with shortness of breath should be investigated ASAP for heart attack/angina and pulmonary embolism (clots in lung), especially since you have history of diabetes and stroke.Please consult your doctor regarding this immediately. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
