I actually felt sick for a the last half.\u00a0\u00a0But when it's over, it doesn't seem that bad.\u00a0\u00a0It's making it through the duration that's torture.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't stress too terribly much over it for now.\u00a0\u00a0Even if it's positive, it's really not that bad.\u00a0\u00a0Just a few more restrictions on your diet.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck...and bring a book to read.\u00a0\u00a0And if you feel sick, ask if you can lay down for awhile...they'll usually let you have a bed.",

    "question": "I have to go in for the 3 hour Glucose test tomorrow morning and I have no idea what to expect. My Dr.'s cut off is 140 and I was 143. The only reason why he is making me take the 3 hour test is because my first baby was 9.3lbs ( I didn't have GD with him) and he wants to find out if I do actually have Gestational Diabetes. I guess it could make the baby a lot bigger if i do and he wants to avoid that if possible.Thank you!",
