            "answer": "Hi. Has your mom been previously diagnosed with cancer? If not, I just find it hard to believe that a finding of possible liver metastases on CT scan would not prompt her doctors to look for the possible source (the \"primary\" lesion) of those metastases.\u00a0\u00a0If those liver lesions are indeed metastases, her upper back pain could indicate metastatic lesions to the spine as well, which should warrant further investigation (i.e. bone scan).\u00a0\u00a0At this point, I cannot give you a definite prognosis because the medical information you have volunteered about your mother is too sparse.\u00a0\u00a0I need to know her age, other medical conditions, if she's been previously diagnosed with cancer, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Offhand, if those liver lesions on CT are indeed cancer metastases, then she's at an advanced stage (Stage 4) of the disease, and cure may be out of the question.\u00a0\u00a0But it may still be possible to achieve good control (prevent spread of the cancer and stabilize the disease) depending on what the primary lesion is (example: breast, lung, colon, ovarian, etc.).\u00a0\u00a0Those liver lesions may need to be biopsied, to establish a diagnosis of cancer, and to give a clue about the type of cancer involved.",

            "answer": "Sir,My mom is 69 years of age of thin built.(never crossed 42kgs in her life).She was very active until this acute back pain developed all of a sudden.she has some slip disc problems and osteoporosis for which she has been taking calcium.This problem of slip disc dates back to 1980s-is an age old problem.Never had any other problems-blood pressure, diabetes leave alone cancer.Therefore we were all taken aback when the doctors mentioned that she is in stage 4 without any further investigation.The oncologist even said that the secondary metastases is easy to find out through ct.The doctors here said that even if the primary tumor is\u00a0\u00a0found out,there was no cure because she was in stage 4.She will not be able to bear the aggressive cancer treatment-So decide if you want to subject her to these tests or give palliative cure.Moreover, mom is in acute back pain even now and dreads going to the hospital even for an x ray..My mom is on painkillers now.I think i will have to somehow convince her for a biopsy. I thank you for giving me this vital advice.I am convinced that we have to go ahead with the biopsy.Sir, I thank you with all my heart for spending your invaluable time for us.",
