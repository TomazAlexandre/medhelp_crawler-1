In otherwords, instead of just treating when the symptoms show up, you continually treat for 6mo to a year.It would be wise to try and find out for sure if you do suffer from chronic yeast and not just vaginitis which is really hard to pin down the cause.\u00a0\u00a0Be aware that 50% of all yeast cultures, KOH preps and slides are negative.Find a good gyn that deals with chronic vulvo vaginal issues.\u00a0\u00a0You need someone who understands what is going on won't just treat you without finding out what is wrong and why it's happening.",

            "answer": "I also suffered from reoccurant yeast infections. One thing that helped me TREMENDOUSLY was the use of boric acid suppositories. Many medical providers do not know about this treatment, but it has been proven very effective at treating resistant infections. Basically, boric acid is available over-the-counter, but you may have to call a few drug stores to find one that carries it. The pharmacist can fill some gelatin capsules for you, but you can actually do it yourself if you prefer. You can order boric acid online and fill your own capsules. Insert vaginally at night, just don't get any in your mouth. There is also a prepared homopathic treatment that uses boric acid and several herbs called \"Yeast Arrest\". You can probably find it a health food store or herbalist. Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "my heart goes to u and to all of the people who are suffering from this problem, coz i've been dealing with this too, before i was diagnosed with BV, and was treated with vaginal suppository, if i wasnt mistaken it was metronidazole, and was given an antibiotic at the latter treatment for it not to come back on me again, the BV was cured...and i have'nt had any fishy smelling discharge anymore...(thank god)...but months after, i started to have discharge again, it's thick, and odorless, but it started to scare once again coz the my ObG said that these infections are bound to repeat several times, and can be very consistent...i will just have to go back to my doc next week to complain about my once again discharge problem... I think your diabetes 1 condition, is a major contributor to your problem with yeast infection, try to look for another ObG that can really help you with it, not just a doctor that prescribes the same thing over and over again, without even realizing that you are not really being treated...goodluck and i'll be praying that all of our conditions will be treated for our peace of mind....",

            "answer": "I too have type 1 diabetes and have struggled with a never ending yeast infection for about 2-3 years. I've been to a few OBGYNs and just got treated for symptoms. They did test for everything from STDs to BV, turns out I have something called Candida albicans. I also went to my endocrinologist and he said that uncontrolled diabetes is the culprit. I got a 10 day treatment of vaginal supositories as well as a dose of\u00a0\u00a0diflucan for me and my partner but a week after I finished my treatment I got a light yeast infection and then it got progressively worse with each infection there after. Now I just treat with Garlic. It relieves my symptoms with just a few days of use and I've just sort of have learnt to deal with the infections. I use a clove of garlic as a vaginal supository for 3 days and start getting relief\u00a0\u00a0from the itching like 10 minutes after insertion. The infection does go away for a bit even if it comes back a week later but I just do it again and am not that concerned because it should be less harmful than all those creams, pills and supositories.",

    "question": "Hi everybody, my name is Gisselle and I have a major issue.... for about 1 year now, I have had a yeast infection that doesnt seem to go away.The first time, i went to the gyno and they presribed a 3 day insertion tube and cream. It went away for about 2 months, then it came back again, and used that cream about 4 times and It always came back. About 2 months ago, I went to a different doctor and he prescribed the same cream but also gave me \"diflucan\" and told me to have my partner take one as well and spread some cream on his penis at night. I tought I was cured until I now have this damn infection again. I even tried taking a vitamin called \"yeast and fungal detox\" and still nothing. I am pretty much sick and tired of this yeast infection and dont know what else to do. Some people told me that I get this because I am a type 1 diabetic. So does that mean that Im doomed to having a chronic yeast infection my entire life? If anybody has been trhough this or is a doctor, please show me some light at the end of the tunnel. Thank you so much, and sorry if i seem so desperate, i just cant take this anymore!!!",
