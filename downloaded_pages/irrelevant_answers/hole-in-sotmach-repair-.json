    "question": "I am 29 and had a lap band removed but it had eroded into my stomach making a hole. My doc didnt see the hole when he went to take the lap band out but about three days later I turned really sick and he did emergency surg and found the hole. The hole is repaired now but I was in ICU for 6 days and\u00a0\u00a0in hospital for an additional 8 days and I am finally back at home now. I am having high wbcs at first went to 25000 but now 2 weeks later at 15100. Im on vancomycin now and diffulcan but they dont know why my count is high. I finally stopped have fever(going highest to 101.5) but had it while in the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0I am suffering with diarrhea and I just want to know how long it takes the stomach to heal? Should my wbc start going down? My entire gi system seems out of order. When should the diarrhea stop?",
