    "question": "Hi! I was diagnosed with being mildly low thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0(my tsh was 6.9, and my T4 was just at 10.1) My doctor gave me a prescription for synthroid because I was presenting symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Since my first pill, my sweat smells like watermelon. (as my husband says.)\u00a0\u00a0It smells strongly right after a shower, I am assuming because I take HOT showers and heat up my body. I do not use any fragrances, nor perfume.\u00a0\u00a0I wash with Dove sensitive soap.I saw my doctor the next day because I was worried about sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0He pricked my finger in the office to check for possible diabetes, He said it was within normal range.\u00a0\u00a0And I have had my urine tested for protein.\u00a0\u00a0(Keitones? sp?)\u00a0\u00a0and glucose...again in normal range.I then took it upon myself to stop taking the synthroid to rule out if that was what was causing the smell.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't taken the pill now for 16 days, and the smell is just as strong.I know that it isn't the worst thing to be complaining about, I do smell good! but with my on going health problems last year, I just wanted to be sure there isn't anything else I should be looking at.\u00a0\u00a0 Please advise!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
