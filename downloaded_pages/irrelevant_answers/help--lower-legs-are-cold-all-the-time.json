            "answer": "Hello,Stress and anxiety can cause cold legs. During times of stress, such as during anxious moments, blood is shunted to our vital organs and away from our extremities causing vasospasticity. The surge of adrenalin in the bloodstream as a result of stress causes constriction in the capillaries and small arteries going to the hands and feet where there is a high concentration of nerve endings resulting in cold legs.Cold legs may also be caused by Reynaud\u2019s disease(disorder that affects the flow of blood to the fingers and sometimes to the toes), diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis,vascular disorders and underactive thyroid.So pls get yourself evaluated for that.Various investigations like blood sugar tests,thyroid profile,MRA(magnetic resonance angiography),nail fold capillaroscopy,ESR and ANA test are required to confirm a diagnosis.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts.",
