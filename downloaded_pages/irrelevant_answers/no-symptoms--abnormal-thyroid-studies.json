            "answer": "Well, you just listed some symptoms that in view of your test results are probably hyper related.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest that when you talk to doctor, you request testing for free T3 and free T4, instead of the total T3 and total T4, which are somewhat obsolete and not nearly as useful as tets for the \"Frees\".\u00a0\u00a0I would also request testing for the tyroid antibodies, TPO ab and TG ab, to see if these tests identify a possible cause your test results and symptoms.When you get those tests done, please get a copy\u00a0\u00a0and post the actual results and reference ranges and members will be glad to help interpret.",

            "answer": "Thanks,I did go back to my labs and the T4 is listed as T4 Free, and the T3 is just listed as T3.\u00a0\u00a0I will assume that the T3 is total.My MD called today requesting me to f/u with Endocrine as he suspects Graves, but wasn't certain. I have reviewed literature that indicates low TSH, with normal Free T4, and elevated T3 total/and or T3 free could indicate T3 Toxicosis.Not really sure what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0A physical exam did not show any thyroid enlargement, actually it was very difficult to palpate, no tachycardia, or other obvious hyper symptoms.My main question is that if this is some type of Graves, or Toxicosis, without major symptoms, would it be reasonable to wait it out and recheck levels in 6 months?\u00a0\u00a0I am not thrilled about taking medications, but don't want to end up with major life threatening symptoms either.Thanks for your help.",

            "answer": "Personally I would not wait around.\u00a0\u00a0I would go ahead with an Endo appt. so that additional testing can be done to better identify cause and determine action plan.\u00a0\u00a0Try to make sure that you find an Endo that specializes in thyroid problems.\u00a0\u00a0Many of them do not, they are frequently more into diabetes.",

    "question": "On a routine physical my TSH came back at .06, so I was called back for additional labs.Follow up labs showed: TSH of .02, T3 of 236 (normal 60-180), and a normal T4 1.4.(0.8-1.8)A thyroid scan/uptake was done.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that the 4 hour uptake was 30% (norm is 3 - 16%) and 24 hour was 49% (norm is 8 - 25%).I do have lack of concentration, some nervousness/irritability which just could be me :), but am more syptomatic of hypo (fatigure, weight gain, cold)I have not heard back from my physician yet, but want to know if there is a reason to treat the above if there are no obvious hyper symptoms?",
