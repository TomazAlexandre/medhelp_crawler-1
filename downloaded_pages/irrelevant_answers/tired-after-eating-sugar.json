            "answer": "Blood sugar problems are not confined to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Alcohol is mostly sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Since sugar isn't good for you anyway and it doesn't agree with her, why eat it?\u00a0\u00a0I mean, once in a while for a treat, but it isn't working for her, which is great since there's not benefit to it.\u00a0\u00a0But again, it sounds like a blood sugar problem one way or the other.",

            "answer": "Obviously avoiding sugar altogether would circumvent the problem, but we would still prefer to know whether or not she has a medical condition.Yesterday she measured her blood sugar which was 125 mg/dl [6.95 mmol/l) two hours after eating and 95 mg/dl [5.27 mmol/l] another two hours later. If I am not mistaken, these are healthy levels.",

    "question": "My sister (25 y/o, normal weight) has been struggling with a certain phenomenon for years.Right after consuming sugar she feels normal, but a few hours afterwards she starts feeling extremely tired and exhausted. I know this might sound trivial, but it does not seem normal to me and since it happens even after small amounts of sugar, the situation is fairly annoying to her at times, especially since she cannot focus on her work or studying if it happens.She asked her doctor once but he had no explanation for it. She has tested negative for Diabetes multiple times.On a probably unrelated note: She does not react very well to alcohol either. Even after drinking very small amounts, she gets extremely tired and gets a red face (like a very light allergic reaction). Therefore, she does not drink alcohol at all, but I thought there might possible be a connection to her sugar-problem.",
