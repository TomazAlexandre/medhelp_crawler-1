            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The infection may control in about 15 days, but at times yeast infection or thrush is very difficult to treat. You may need to take oral antifungal pills twice a week for 3-4 weeks along with local application of antifungal cream. There are many types of antifungals available. Take an OTC antifungal with a combination of two or more anti fungals. Use both oral and local application. Provided it is indeed fungus, then only try this. Antifungal tablets are strong medicines and should not be taken otherwise. So start with cream and if it helps, start the tablet. Various reasons for recurrent fungal infection are incomplete treatment, treatment resistance, co-existing dermatitis, diabetes and low immunity. At times both partners need to be treated if the fungal infection involves the genitalia like the penile head or vagina. Do discuss with your treating doctor. Take care!",
