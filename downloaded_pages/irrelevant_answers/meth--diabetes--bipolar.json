            "answer": "Hi HoneyI'm so sorry for your parents divorcee and your Moms addictions\u00a0\u00a0 You will be living with your Dad? The meth your Mom is doing is what is probably throwing her blood sugar out of control.. On meth you do not eat nor drink fluids and you know how important diet is for a diabetic.. Your Mom is the only one too make the decision to get clean :( You can talk to her tell her of your concerns of how her addiction is affecting you I know she has probably heard this all before, maybe if you wrote it in a letter taking your time to say all the things you have been wanting to say.. Write it without anger but with the sadness you feel.. She will be able to read that letter over and over and maybe you can plant a seed in her head.. As a Mom we love our kids it's just sometimes the addiction is bigger then ourselves.. Again I'm sorry honey but if you keep posting you will receive the support YOU need and maybe learn how to deal with Mom.. Warmly lesa",
