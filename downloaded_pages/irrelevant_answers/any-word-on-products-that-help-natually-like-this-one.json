            "answer": "Interesting note: The Page Source for this site shows a date of 1999. If its been around that long it hasn't lived up to it's claim or there would be an enormous following, which I cannot find. Another problem I have is when a web page does NOT list an address for its location. For all I know this stuff is being manufactured in outer Mongolia under no supervision or guidelines, then imported with toxins. The question one has to ask themselves is yes these are good supplements but will mixing them together cause greater harm than good? Are the supplements coming from a good or a potential deadly source? I'm not saying Optimum Diabetics is bad for you, but buyer beware.",
