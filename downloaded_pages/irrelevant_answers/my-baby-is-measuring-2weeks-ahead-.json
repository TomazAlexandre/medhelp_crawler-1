            "answer": "My Dr told me it's very common for babies to have a major growth spurt between 28 and 34 weeks. Then growth slows back down. It is not mean baby will be big or that a c section is necessary. Remember growth is in centimeters, 2 weeks isn't actually that much overall.",

            "answer": "When I was 29 weeks, my daughter was measuring at 31 weeks. My doctor said it doesn't mean the baby is coming early or anything. It's just one of those things that sometimes happens. At first, I thought it was because my fianc\u00e9e is 6'7\" so maybe my daughter was taking after his side of the family and she is long for her gestational age, but who knows. As long as your baby is healthy, that's all that matters.",
