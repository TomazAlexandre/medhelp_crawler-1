I failed my first one too didn't take the three hour test because the 1 hr was too much sugar for me and I got extremely sick. So they are treating me as if I have GD. The duet us hard at first but you get use to it fast. I regret not eating healthier earlier on in my pregnancy, but that doesn't mean it would have changed anything. My body just isn't producing enough insulin.",
