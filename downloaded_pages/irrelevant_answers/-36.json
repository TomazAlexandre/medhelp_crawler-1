            "answer": "I have a friend who had her third baby at 43w4d. She wasn't showing any signs of any complications, her dates were absolutely for sure accurate, baby just wanted extra baking time. Her little girl was born absolutely perfect and in her own time.But most practitioners force an induction by 42 weeks or so.My midwives will do an ultrasound at 41 weeks to make sure all is well and periodic NSTs after that but don't start talking about induction until 42 weeks because most babies come on their own without needing to be forced.",
