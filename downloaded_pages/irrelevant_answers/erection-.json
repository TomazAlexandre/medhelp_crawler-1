            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Well, if losing weight has helped you, then do get tests done to rule out diabetes and hypothyroidism. Many drugs, medicines and diseases can cause a weak erection. Atherosclerosis and kidney problems are the other culprits. You need to consult an urologist to diagnose the cause and to get the treatment best suited for you. There are many options available and your doctor can guide you best after a complete examination and investigations.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
