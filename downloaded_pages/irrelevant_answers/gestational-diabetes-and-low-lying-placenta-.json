            "answer": "I'm a ftm too and I have gestational diabete. I also had a friend with her placenta too close to the cervix for a natural birth. She had a c section and she and her baby girl are doing great. For diabete, a good diet and exercice can help you a lot. I have insulin so if the doctor think you need it you might have that too to help you control blood sugar. The risk for baby with diabete are hypoglycemia at birth, but doctor and nurses will know to check for that, baby might be oversize and baby might come early. So the risks are not so bad and you can reduce them by managing your blood sugar. Don't hesitate to ask your doctor all your questions being inform is often reassuring. Take care and I wish you a great pregnancy.",
