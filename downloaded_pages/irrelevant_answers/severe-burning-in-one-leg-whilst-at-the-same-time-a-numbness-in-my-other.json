            "answer": "Hi,It will help us to know what kind of abnormalities was seen in the cervical spine. Your symptoms are very suggestive of peripheral neuropathy so it is important to rule out causes like diabetes, B 12 deficiency, and thyroid dysfunction.The possibility of MS also cannot be completely ruled out but this is one condition which is not easily diagnosed. A combination of medical history, MRI brain, neurological exam and lumbar puncture helps to diagnose MS.Regards",
