            "answer": "Montefiori Medical Center (Bronx, New York) performed an in-depth study of 240 women receiveing Lantus (insulin glargine) during pregnancy. The results were published in the Journal of Reproductive Medicine, April, 2009 (4) 208-10. They found the drug to be well-tolerated and advised continuing the use of Lantus during pregnancy. PubMed has no studies whatsoever that substantiate an adverse affect on pregnancy.",

            "answer": "Hi,controlling your blood sugar is critical for your babies' well being.In pregnancy this requires both basal and bolus insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Seems your new doctor is not so experienced in managing diabetic pregnancy.Lantas and humalog combination is used by many already as seen above.When I was pregnant I used Humalin-N (NPH) as my basal and Humalog as my bolus.Keep up your hard work on managing theblood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Get a second opunion, if necessary but for now I'd go back to the lantus to get your blood sugars under control again.During pregnancy insulin needs will rise dramatically, so keep adjusting and monitoring very closely as the pregnancy progresses.",

            "answer": "The only reason i changed doctors in the first place is bc he moved and closed his office. Him nor my baby doctor have said anything about me getting off the Lantus and all of a sudden it seems like a big concern to this new one. I have been eating right and taking the amount of insulin she suggested and it still won't regulate and personally i believe they go hand in hand and the reason i need both is bc they work together to bring my sugar down. Thanks for your advice.",

    "question": "I have been diabetic for ten years now and have been taking lantus and humalog this whole time. Well a new doctor Im seeing took me off lantus due to the fact that it could cause my twins to become insulin resistant. She has me taking more of the humalog but it doesn't seem to be helping me and now i have a harder time controlling my sugar where before i kept it pretty well controlled. Should i get a second opinion or does anyone have suggestions? I just want my babies healthy and myself to get this under control.",
