            "answer": "Back in 1986 I met fellow diabetic Roger. He had a horrible Crystal Meth problem at 21 yrs old and at first had results like yours while on cm. it didn't always work for him so his insulin was spotty dosage at best. One day I got a call Roger was in the hospital with a diabetic / crystal meth stroke. He never walked again, has very slurry speech and is half a vegetable wearing diapers. Also I know 36 yr old Mary who is in the nursing home also. She liked weed and extacy a lot and her mind is clear but no legs below the knee and sores everywhere plus eye problems. I've been type 1 since 1985 and gave up all sins except the occasional cig, and am now 53 with 0 complications. The choice is yours, take your diabetes seriously and learn how to manage it the right way before that one day the lightning bolt strikes and you end up in the same place as Roger or Mary.",
