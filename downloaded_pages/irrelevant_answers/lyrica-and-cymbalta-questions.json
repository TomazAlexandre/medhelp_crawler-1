            "answer": "I take Lyrica & Cymbalta. I works very well for me. Lyrica is not a new drug, just \"new\" for fibro. It affects the nerve receptors in the brain. It has helped me a great deal. Cymbalta also helps with the nerve pain.I definitly recommend giving it a try. It is started at low dose, then increased slowly.(Lyrica)It took me to get to 200mg a day before I saw improvement, and 400 to rally take away the pain. My problem is I'm fighting my insurance company to approve it. It is $125. a month, and I can't afford it unless my insurance company will approve it, so I have had to start decreasing my dose. That sucks. The first time I took it last summer, I gained 15lbs. I stopped, as I have type 2 diabetes and couldn't control my blood sugar. This time, 3 mos ago, I re-started it, watching my carbs diligently, and have lost 6 lbs. It makes you crave carbs big time. So forwarned is forarmed. Good luck if you try it.",

Other than craving carbs it has worked for me, and has increased my tolerance for exercise, which is ectremely low. If you try it, start slowly with low dose. Good luck, post your results if you can.",

    "question": "OK - can anyone who has taken Lyrica and Cymbalta in conjunction with each other please give me your experiences --- and how long you've been taking them?I've been temporarily \"diagnosed\" with neuropathic pain issues (think Fibromyalgia).Waiting on some final test results to rule out any other Autoimmune Disease - but I believe I'll be finally diagnosed as Fibromyalgia.My Rheumatologist / Internist has prescribed Lyrica and Cymbalta together.Now - with that in mind - I need to tell you that I finished Treatment for Hepatitis C, with Sustained Virologic Response (what is considered a cure) - with Interferon and Ribavirin --- I finished it last year in March/February. But have had pain for the last 3 years, which I associated with Hepatitis C, etc.I ALSO HAVE ADVERSE REACTIONS TO MEDICATIONS and have ADHD.Adverse reactions to include:++On methlyphenidate (literally \"speed\") I eat everything in the house and get sleepy.++On Percocets 10/325, I wake up and don't feel pain... But I don't get \"high\" like other people seem to.++Coffee puts me to sleep or just makes my heart race...++Valium makes me grumpy.Now, with that knowledge - and knowing that outside of prescribed medications that I DO NOT TAKE DRUGS, nor do I drink very often (champagne at weddings, maybe a glass of wine or two a month - or if I go out with the girls once a month, I might have a margarita kind of drinking...)My concerns are:---Long term effect(s)---Long term side effects---Temporary side effects---WHAT DOES IT ACTUALLY DO?---Is there a noticeable difference in pain --- if so, how much?Is it worth it to me to try out the LYRICA - Cymbalta combo she's prescribed?If so - what should I expect?And TRULY --- how bad is the weight gain? (Because I'm already pretty chunky... LOL!)I'm pretty funny about medicines and I'm a bit \"scared\" to try anything \"new\". Especially New to the market.MekiPs. Thank you for your time - I originally posted this in the arthritis forum and am reposting this here because someone with Fibromyalgia might see it.",
