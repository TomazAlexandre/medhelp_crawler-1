    "question": "Dear Friends,I joined this board in 2005 and discovered a wealth of information and caring people which gave me the confidence to take the treatment plunge.\u00a0\u00a0After several years of fearing tx and its potential for permanent side effects I completed 48 weeks of IFN/Riba/Alinia in Feb. 2009.\u00a0\u00a0Three month post tx PCR showed UND and although I haven't done 6 month PCR I know I'm still UND.It was a brutal treatment and an uncertain six months of post tx recovery but every day of hell was worth it.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't felt this good since 1982 when I contracted the virus. I'm 55 but feel (and act) like a teenager. I have literally been reborn. I wake up at 6 am ready to go (never did that -- always needed 10 hours of sleep), play softball 3 nights a week, and tackle home improvement like the energizer bunny.\u00a0\u00a0Thankfully, I don't remember treatment, just vague memories of lying in bed.I'm writing this to you undergoing or contemplating treatment--- there is light at the end of the tunnel and every day of treatment will hopefully bring you closer.\u00a0\u00a0My only regret is not being diagnosed and treating sooner.\u00a0\u00a0Twenty seven years of HCV has left me with autoimmune diabetes and I now spend much of my time on another board educating myself about this lifestyle-complicating disease.\u00a0\u00a0But if that's my only complaint I'll take it.I'm no doctor but I would strongly recommend research into Alinia if you are considering treatment.\u00a0\u00a0I had several risk factors for non-SVR such as genotype 1a, high starting viral load (80 million), and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Yet I achieved SVR and want to shout it out to the world.After years of feeling ill and obsessively researching HCV and treatment It feels strange to be on the other side.\u00a0\u00a0I can't say enough about this board.\u00a0\u00a0Many long time members know more than the medical community about HCV, treatment, lab results and relief of side effects.\u00a0\u00a0They'll be a great source of knowledge and comfort for those of you newly diagnosed.I wish you all well in your journey against this diseaseKittyface",
