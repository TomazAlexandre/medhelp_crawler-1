            "answer": "Your boyfriend needs medical attention and needs checked for all things that could cause this, some of which could be serious if ignored. For instance, I know a 17 year old guy whose mother kept fussing at him for laying around and sleeping and not waking up when she tried to wake him. One morning he collapsed in the floor and the medics were called. It was diabetes and his sugar was over 600.If a medical cause is not identified, he should have a sleep study. Anthing from sleep apnea to narcolepsy can cause a need for too much sleep. Hypersomnia is the don't-know-why diagnosis after EVERY other possible thing has been formally ruled out by testing. It's not about fitting any particular profile. It's about leaving no stone unturned and nothing to guesswork. His sleep habits are not normal and he should be thoroughly evaluated - yesterday.",

            "answer": "thankyou for that. It has only been going on for the last few days but we will get it chacked out. He has been told that he is definately not a diabetic,however he is a likely carrier of von wili branz(unsure of spelling but its a derived version of heamophillia) this may be causing issues. but thankyou for your advice.",

    "question": "My boyfriend has been falling asleep alot during the day and finding it extremely difficult to wake up from these \"naps\", he sleeps for nine or so hours a night and does not overdo it during the day. He seems to be a healthy 18 year old-his diet could be better but it isnt terrible,he isnt overweight or underweight,he often wakes up feeling angry, disorientated and confused as to where he is and who he is. we feel it might be hypersomnia but would like a second opinion. could anybody help us come to a conclusion.",
