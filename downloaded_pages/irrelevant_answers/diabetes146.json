            "answer": "Maybe the MD wants to make sure the blood test is not in error so ordered a\u00a0\u00a0second test.They usually do more than 1 test on a blood draw.is your diabetes getting worse?\u00a0\u00a0I dont know what are your BG numbers?It doesnt sound like you know that much about diabetes and the control of it.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest you find out more of the relationship of what causes BG to rise (eating carbohydrates), self testing, drugs to lower BG and complications (retinopathy, neropathy...).\u00a0\u00a0Complications are NOT part of diabetes, complications are from uncontrolled diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0By uncontrolled I mean BG over 136, for when BG goes over 136 that is when damage to your eyes and nerves and blood vesals happens.Complications are NOT inevitable. dont settle for what the MD says is OK its your body you pay the price for uncontrolled BG not the MD.",

I also have prolific retinopathy .Is my diabetes getting worse or am I worrying unnecessary.",
