            "answer": "Occasionally x-rays can miss fractures, so if I were you, I'd request an MRI of the area.\u00a0\u00a0Also, you don't state your age, but if you have any osteoporosis or Diabetes going on, it could have worsened since the initial injury.\u00a0\u00a0Please go to your MD and ask for another evaluation of the area, and tell him that you want an MRI because you KNOW x-rays can miss seeing hairline fractures.\u00a0\u00a0In the interim, you can help it out by elevating it and staying off it when possible.\u00a0\u00a0If pain becomes too much to bear, you can use ice packs or hot packs to the area, and take an anti-inflammatory medicine that's over the counter, like Ibuprofen/Advil or Alleve.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

    "question": "An iron gate fell on the outer side of my foot 2 1/2 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0It cut the skin and bruised about an inch below my little toe.\u00a0\u00a0I got an x-ray and the doctor did not see anything.\u00a0\u00a0I also got a tetanus shot.\u00a0\u00a0The visible bruising disappeared after about a week, but the pain is still there 2 1/2 months later.\u00a0\u00a0I can walk but after a few hours of walking/standing in shoes the area becomes painful.\u00a0\u00a0It still hurts when touched.\u00a0\u00a0Can a bad bruise cause pain this long after the injury, or is this something that I should go to another doctor for?",
