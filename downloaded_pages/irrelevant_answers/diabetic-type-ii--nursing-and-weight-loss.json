    "question": "I was diagnosed with Type II diabetes (diet controlled) after my second child. I am 36 and struggling with two things. I have lost all my pregnancy weight and still losing. I am down to 100 pounds. My height is 5\u2019 2\u201d and a small frame. I am also nursing my 7 month old still. How much weight can I loose without being worried? I get upset that people say things like \u2026I am lucky.My second question is I have been struggling keeping my blood sugar high enough during the day. I will drop down sometimes to the 60\u2019s. I even had a 59 the other day without any symptoms. I have been adding more carbs in diet to correct this but it seems I am poking and eating all the time lately. Is something changing now that I am loosing weight?",
