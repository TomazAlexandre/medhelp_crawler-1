    "question": "Ima write EXACTLY what it says in the magazine!A decade ago Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) was a little known, and little understood condition. Today its the most common hormonal disorder among women of repoductivve age and the main cause of infertility in UK women. What's more, some experts believe that Polycystic Ovaries might affect as many as one in four women,, and that the number of sufferers is likely to rise further, thanks to modern life styles.Polycystic Ovaries are caused by a large number of Cysts (Fluid filled sacs) that grow just below the surface ofone or both ovaries. When a woman displays some or all of the collection of symptoms normally associated with Polycystic Ovaries she is said to suffer from PCOS.GP an author, Dr Sarah Brewer says: 'With PCOS, the ovaries produce too many male hormones, such as testosterone which block the normal monthly growth and development of egg follicles, creating the cysts. Most women with Polycystic Ovaries are less responsive to insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar, putting them at an increase of Diabetes.'The main symptoms include oily skin or acne, increased facial or body hair and thinning hair on the scalp. 50% if sufferers are overweight or obese and 70% of women with PCOS have light or irregular, or miss periods'Not only is PCOS a ticking time bomb for the future of our fertility, if left unchecked, its also linked to serious health issues, such as Type 2 Diabetes, heart disease, and endometrial cancer.The statistic most quoted is that One in Ten women have PCOS: says Norah Lane, founder of Diet Care. 'But the real number is likely to be much higher. One in four women is thought to have Polycystic Ovaries, but they may not display any symptoms or not make the connection between the smptoms they are experiencing and the condition. Many women don't get diagnosed with PCOS untill they start trying for a baby, and, even then they might have been trying to conceive for some time before seeking help. It's no wonder that the latest figures sow that more women than eer are undergoing fertility treatment in the UK'Natalie Cassidy and Jools Oliver (Famous peeeeeeoples) who have been diagnosed with PCOS, both gave birth in the last few weeks. Both have spoken out about thir struggles to convieve, making their new arrivals a double blessing. Other stars with PCOS include Victoria Beckham, Tana Ramsay and Zoe Ball.The Trigger for PCOS is unclear but most experts think genetics plays a role, since it tends to run in families. There is NO cure, But symptoms can be managed with some lifestyle adjustments.'A lot of the symptoms of PCOS can be improved by diet, exercise and supplements:' Says Dr Brewer.Follow a low GI diet because balancing blood sugar leels can improve insulin resistance, Try to lose excess weight - even a modest loss of about 1 st (6kg) can correct hormonal abnormalities, reduce acne and unwanted hair and improve fertility. Regular exercise helps to overcome insulin resistance in muscle cells and can also improve mose PCS symptoms. GPs sometimes perscrie a drug called Metformin which can imporve insulin sensitivity.'If you suspect you might suffer from PCOS, speak to your GP.'You don't have to put up with your symptoms,; says Norah. 'There's lots you can do to help yourself.'What can you do?'Medication may help in the short term, but in the long run, healthy eating is the single biggest way to improve the symptoms' Says Dietcare founder Norah Lane. 'PCOS is a hormone imbalance and sufferers are particularly senstive to all the chemicals we are expsed to in our modern lives. Avoid porcessed foods and buy organic whenever possible.''You can also try eating tiny a tiny piece of protein such as chicken, turkey, egg, fish cottage cheese every 15 minutes,' advises Norah, 'These can help to speed up the metabolism, provide essential vitamins and stop hunger pangs. Other PCOS- friendly foods include strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and organic vegetables.;Dr Sarah Brewer says: 'Supplements that might help to alleviate symptoms include evening primrose oil, isoflavones, magesium supplements, B Vitamins, Chromium, and Angus Catus. Saw Palmetto may be suggested but should only be taken by women under thee supervision of a medical herbalist.'This is in England but it might help with others with the info I found out... the Figures of people having it are based in England no where else...Hope this helps??x",
