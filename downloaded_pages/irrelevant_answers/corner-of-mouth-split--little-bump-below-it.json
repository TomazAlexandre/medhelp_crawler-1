            "answer": "Hi,Differentials for your case will be cheiltis and impetigo.Cheilitis is due to an underlying yeast infection that may infect the corners of the mouth.Several factors are associated with the development of cheilitis.Poor oral hygiene, an underlying systemic infection like diabetes, dental problems and frequent irritation of the area may cause it.Impetigo on the other hand is a bacterial infection that may present with lesions containing a clear fluid that eventually bursts and crusts.I suggest that you have this assessed by your physician as impetigo (if this is what it is) is contagious.An antifungal medication may help relieve cheilitis. Impetigo may require topical antimicrobial creams.",

            "answer": "I had this happen to me and was an ongoing problem for YEARS and it would last for months at a time!\u00a0\u00a0I was told it was a yeast infection by many drs-but the yeast medication never helped!\u00a0\u00a0I finally did a little research and found out that it could be a vitamin B deficiency-so now when I get those painful splits in the corner of my mouth, I take a vitamin B complex and it usually is cleared up by the next day-if it is really bad, it takes 2 days. I continue to take the extra B complex vitamin for a good 2 weeks, just to make sure they don't come back.\u00a0\u00a0 I rarely get them now.\u00a0\u00a0You can also use aquaphor to help soften the tissue.\u00a0\u00a0Hope it helps!",
