            "answer": "I've heard being really thirsty can be related to gestational diabetes. I'm not heavy but I do have a couple extra pounds and I did want to lose a few pounds before becoming pregnant just because I was kinda worried about that. I'm gonna try not to worry about it tho since I'm reading to more normal than anything to be thirsty.",

    "question": "All I do is drink water!!! Constantly feeling the need to drink more more and more. Is this normal? Also, like before I was pregnant if I drank a lot of water my urine would be clear pretty much. But even with all the water I'm drinking now that I'm pregnant, it's yellow, sometimes cloudy. It's sometimes a dull yellow too. I have no pain like in my back where my kidneys are or anything..idk it just seems strange. Any one hear of this or experience it themselves? I don't have an appointment until March 9th and I've read online it could be something with my liver but yoy can't always believe stuff online. I'd feel really silly calling and asking about this...",
