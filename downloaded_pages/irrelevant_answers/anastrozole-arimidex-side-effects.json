            "answer": "I'm not sure that your problems can be the result of Arimidex. There are other drugs and each and every one has basically the same side effects BUT not all are always experienced by every person ... also many even though a factor, are not experienced to the same degree. You might take this up with your Oncology Team in detail. You should remember though that this may be totally unrelated to Arimidex or any other aromatase inhibitor.\u00a0\u00a0Regards ....",

            "answer": "Thanks for your response.\u00a0\u00a0Most of the problems I have had are listed as side effects on the pharmacists notes that I have received.\u00a0\u00a0You are right.\u00a0\u00a0It is not possible to absolutely link any of my problems to the drug, but I am sure enough that I am just about ready to discontinue it to see if things improve.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure it would be against medical advice, but as near as I can tell from the medical literature I have read, the connection is a distinct possibility, even if it has not been scientifically proved.",

    "question": "I have been taking Anastrozole for about two and half years for stage 1 ER/PR positive breast cancer.\u00a0\u00a0About a year after I started taking the drug, I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes that is not particularly well controlled, even though I take two different prescriptions.\u00a0\u00a0A few months after that I was diagnosed with high cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0For that I now take Lipitor, which has lowered the total cholesterol quite a bit.\u00a0\u00a0Now my blood pressure seems to be increasing to the point, where my primary care doctor is considering a bp prescription.\u00a0\u00a0There is a family history of Cushing's, and I am thinking this is beginning to sound like that.\u00a0\u00a0I know there are other aromatase inhibitors.\u00a0\u00a0If this is a medication induced Cushing's syndrome, are there other aromatase inhibitors that might lessen these side effects?",
