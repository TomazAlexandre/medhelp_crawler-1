            "answer": "oh... Bless you Carolyn!!!I fill your frustration. I wish I could have some information for you.but I dont. I can just fill and listen. and hopefully comfort.\u00a0\u00a0 If the dr told you not to worry about your weight. then I wouldnt!! Just get that off your mind. One thing I have learned being pregnant are our age already puts us in the High risk cat.... You being in the third trimester is wonderful!!! and diabetes in the family... to go this long... you should only pat yourself on the back for doing such a wonderful job. Just hang in there.. you only have a few more weeks and than can have him in your arms to see how wonderful all your work has payed off. IT would have to take a really strong will person to have to go thur a pregnancy and to watch her diet!!!! I dont think I would of been able to be that strong. Im sure DH will help you, and I think your son will do more than you think. He sounds kind\u00a0\u00a0hearted and concerned about your health. Just let him know you will need some help and Im sure he will appreicate the asking and will make him a stronger person.\u00a0\u00a0We all like to fill needed. this is such a wonderflu learning experience for him too.I understand about the medical issue...diabetes can be a very dangerious not kept a close eye on. but it sounds like your OB is on top of it and just keeping a close eye on you. My first child... they were telling me I was borderline in my third trimester and I have never heard of it then... 16 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0really common in preganacys even for the ones that dont even carry it in their DNADONT GIVE UP.... your doing wonderful... hang in there...Let your dr know you wont have alot of help at home... perhaps he will keep you in the hospatal longer than the norm...",

            "answer": "Carolyn,I don't know anything about the diabetes angle so I can't offer any help there (so sorry) but I did want to tell you that my sis in law gained a whopping 4 pounds in pregnancy. She was heavy to begin with (probably a size 16 or 18) and decided in pregnancy to cut out junk. She ate very healthy but didn't diet as in \"diet\". She ate when she was hungry and didn't eat when she wasn't hungry. She exercised moderately (walks and such) and in normal life her eating would not have constituted a diet at all...she brought in enough calories. Her son is now 11, totally healthy and when born was 8 lbs. So when you are starting off heavier (as I am) the weight gain rules are just different and the norms are different. When you're tiny (say 110lbs) eating healthy for two (say 2,500 calories) may put alot of weight on because they're used to eating 1200/day. For those of us that are heavier, eating 2,500 / day may be less than what we were eating (otherwise we wouldn't be heavier to begin with) so it's the same healthy foods and nutrients, most is going to the baby and the result is lower weight gain for us.I could be way wrong, but that is my logic anyways. So, try and have a peaceful mind about it. And re: diabetes, you know, I hate to use this term, but \"it is what it is\". If you can't control the outcome at this point worrying isn't going to help, right?Hang in there,Chrisitna",

            "answer": "Carolyn,I wouldn't worry about the weight gain either, I lost 5 lbs and haven't gained any and the doctors aren't worried at all. I wasn't too overweight before but the doc said the baby could be small but he should take what he can from me. When I eat I make sure it's organically healthy (I believe the extra chemicals and things in other food doesn't do our body any good) and I'm getting bigger by the minute it seems so I'm not worried. Infact I said to my doctor, I can't understand how someone who is getting bigger then a broad side of a barn isn't gaining! He said count your blessings! I'm trying!!!I haven't been the tolerance test yet but I'm almost doomed to fail! Everyone in my family has diabetes and I'm pre-diabetic..ugh! My sister (39 yrs old) who just had her baby 19 months ago wasn't put on anything but she did have to watch what she ate like a hawk. NO SUGAR AT ALL.. she said it was such fun, but she continues after the pregnancy to live by them rules and has since lost a ton of weight, so it turned out good for her. They did have to take her daughter by c-section but her hubby made sure everything was within reach of her and the baby so she didn't have to move very much when he couldn't help out!Good Luck, I will keep you in my prayers!Patty",

            "answer": "Thank you all so much.\u00a0\u00a0It feels so good to be able to express my feelings without feeling so dumb.\u00a0\u00a0I am a very logical person, but this pregnancy has somehow taken that away, haha.\u00a0\u00a0I called the endo doc today and told him my numbers, and viola I am now on insulin in the evenings before bedtime.\u00a0\u00a0I knew it was coming, I can't do anything to control my fasting numbers.\u00a0\u00a0And like cpatow said, worrying about it isn't going to do much good. I will do ANYTHING to make sure my baby is healthy, and content.\u00a0\u00a0I think if I continue to do what I have been doing with my diet, I shouldn't have to take insulin during the daytime.\u00a0\u00a0I still have some control, :)Every one of you are so great, thank you for your comforting words.\u00a0\u00a0I can look on the upside and thank my lucky stars I (possibly) will be able to fit into all of my pre-pregnancy clothes, and won't be stressing later on about that (for when I get back to work).\u00a0\u00a0There is always a sunny side. Oh, and Patty, I plan on continuing this \"diet\" of eating after the baby as well.\u00a0\u00a0DH has an even higher risk of diabetes in his family, and we both could lose a few extra pounds.\u00a0\u00a0Gabriel is going to need his parents healthy and active to keep up with him (smile)",

    "question": "The nurse said \"It's okay, you will be the envy\", but I am concerned. My official weight gain is 2 1/2 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0She also said that I should start gaining from now on, but then in the next breath said some women don't. I am guessing they aren't concerned because of the weight I was carrying before pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think I am eating enough. All of this gd worrying I am scared to eat a whole lot. I have cut out all the junk, and when I eat I try to eat as healthy (ada diet) as I can.To top it off, my fasting sugars have been high 3 out of the last 4 days, so I am going to have to call the doc, and I know he is going to put me on insulin. I give up!! During my appt yesterday my ob/gyn said you are \"high risk\" for a c section, because of the high sugars and the previa. He ordered an u/s on the 11th to check the baby and the previa. I don't do well with surgeries, and only have my dh to help after the baby gets here. I can't depend on my 17 year old (his senior year and just being a boy and a teenager) I am just so discouraged and down, and scared.\u00a0\u00a0I am upset with myself as well because I am usually so mentally strong, and right now I feel so helpless!!\u00a0\u00a0Ugh, count your blessings Carolyn, count your blessings......",
