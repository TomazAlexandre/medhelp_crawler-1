Just so you know yours is not that much out of range......... Best to you.ALT Blood TestALT (SGPT) A Liver Function TestThe ALT (SGPT) blood test is one that measures the levels of the liver enzyme alanine transaminase (ALT) in the bloodstream. Liver enzymes are generally contained in the cells of the liver; however there are a number of diseases and conditions that cause them to spill from the liver into the bloodstream. Through blood testing doctors can determine the type of enzymes, make a diagnosis and determine the need for any additional testing. In essence, the ALT blood test evaluates how well your liver is working. The ALT test was formerly called serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT).Who Should Have ALT (SGPT) Blood TestsIndividuals that have suspected liver disease or injury should have the ALT blood testing series. Those taking certain medications should also have frequent blood testing for monitoring purposes. Some of the medications that can cause elevated enzymes are Aspirin, Tylenol, Ibuprofen, Diclofenac, Phenylbutazone, Dilantin, Depakote and certain antibiotics. While an elevated enzyme level does not indicate liver disease it can be a marker, allowing physicians to monitor the individuals health closely. The ALT (SGPT) blood test is also recommended for those with viral Hepatitis A and B, those with fatty liver, Diabetes or morbidly obese.Normal Range For The ALT Blood TestingNormal range for the ALT (SGPT) blood test is between 5 and 60 IU/L. It is not uncommon for the levels to fluctuate over time, both rising and lowering. Those that have abnormal ranges, either high or low might need additional blood tests or other screening to determine the cause. It is important to monitor these enzymes, especially in those that take frequent medication or suffer from diseases such as Hepatitis or Diabetes. This blood test can also be used to monitor liver disease, progression and responses to treatment.]]>http://www.bloodtest.org/pages/blood-test-info-test-list-by-category-liver-testing-alt-blood-test",
