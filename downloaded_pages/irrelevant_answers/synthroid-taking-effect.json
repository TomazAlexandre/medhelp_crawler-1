            "answer": "Dear Nora,Have you had a follow up blood test to see where this new dose has put your hormone levels?Do you know what type hypothyroidism you have? The most common is Hashimoto's (autoimmune thyroiditis)and if it's this type, it may take several dose changes before yoy feel better.Did you keep a copy of your lab results? If so, see if they tested your \"antibodies\" levels. In fact if you have your labs and want to, list all the results and we might can comment further.Sincerely,Jim",

            "answer": "Nora,If you find your results at home and don't see that they tested your thyroid antibodies, I would ask them to add this to your tests tommorow if you can. I'm not telling you what to do, it's just a suggestion because many Dr.s for some reason don't test antibodies (The \"Anti-Thyroglobulin & Anti-Thyroperoxidase\") and these are the ones that tell you if it is autoimmune hypothyroidism or not. People with Hashimoto's have to monitor any new sets of symptoms, worsening ones etc... because they are at increased risk for other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, adrenal insufficiency, diabetes, etc..., so if a Dr. says \"it doesn't make any difference what kind you have\", my opinion is that IT DOES MATTER and it's your body, you have a RIGHT to know. Sometimes Dr.s make a patient feel a little silly, just because they suggest a test, treatment option etc... but the Dr.-Patient relationship should be more open than that, so don't feel intimidated if your Dr. seems reluctant. He may be the type that does listen, so I don't mean to pre-judge him (there are many great Dr.s out there), just wanted to prepare you for what most of us out here have been through.",

    "question": "I was dx with hypothyroidism about 6 weeks ago and began taking 50mcg of Synthroid 5 weeks ago. I don't feel any different, still very fatigued, etc. Per Synthroid's website, it can take about 4 weeks to take effect. Can anyone help with your personal experience, ideas for questions/discussion with my doctor?Thanks!Nora",
