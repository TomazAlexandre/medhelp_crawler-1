            "answer": "It'll depend on how ready your body and the baby is. There is no magical number. I've been induced three times. First time was about 16hrs from the start of pitocen to delivery. Second I was on cervidil to soften my cervix and then it was about 10hrs from start of pitocen till delivery. Third again on cervidil overnight and then about 12hrs from start of pitocen until delivery.",

            "answer": "With my first I was induced at 2 weeks overdue. They spent two days trying various methods and finally used a kind of catheter-water balloon device to push my cervix open. My left side was refusing to thin out or what have you so my cervix couldn't dilate.The induction itself was really pretty easy and painless, the labor itself was freaking torture but I figured as much with an overdue baby.",
