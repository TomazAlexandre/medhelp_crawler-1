            "answer": "Hello,As you are a female,so the first possibility that strikes my mind is premenopause.Are you near 40 or 45 years of age.If yes,then this can be a strong possibility. During premenopause, the production of most of the reproductive hormones, including the estrogens, progesterone and testosterone, diminishes and becomes more irregular, often with wide and unpredictable fluctuations in levels.A gynecologist\u2019s consultation and examintion will be helpful.Other possibilities for hot flashes,fatigue and night sweats may be lymphomas, hormone disorders like carcinoid syndrome and hypothyroidism and some neurologic conditions like stroke, autonomic neuropathy, and post-traumatic syringomyelia.Pls discuss these possibilities with your doctor.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.",

            "answer": "HiI am really sorry that you still have no relief from your symptoms. But I am glad that all the suggested tests have been carried out. I am still not sure about your diabetes status.Another line of thought could be ear problems. Ear problems too are known to cause nausea and vertigo. Also spondylitis of cervical spine (neck vertebrae) is known to cause nausea and vertigo. An ENT and an orthopedic consultation can take care of that. Maybe its vertigo that makes you feel shaky. Alternately you could get a brain EEG to rule out epilepsy.Regarding alternate hot and cold flushes \u201cYounger women who are menstruating or expecting to menstruate soon (the premenstrual period typically lasts one week) may encounter hot and/or cold flashes. These episodes do not usually last long, with feelings of cold and heat alternating over the course of as short as a minute. Hot and cold flashes for younger women tend to occur only during times of menstruation or premenstruation (when estrogen is typically lowest). If they occur at other times in a young woman's menstrual cycle, then it might be a symptom of a problem with her pituitary gland; seeing a doctor is highly recommended.\u201d This is taken from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_flashes\u00a0\u00a0I know you have passed your endocrine test but there is no harm in getting your estrogen and progesterone levels checked.Please consult your doctors with these suggestions. Let me know what your doctors say. If you need more help, please feel free to contact. I\u2019ll be happy to answer your queries. Please keep me posted.",
