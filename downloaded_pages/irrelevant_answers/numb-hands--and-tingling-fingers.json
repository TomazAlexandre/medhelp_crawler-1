            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If it was a MRI of neck or upper back, then you need to find out what the report says. You could be having a pinched nerve due to overuse of computers, work involving straining of neck, herniated disc, canal stenosis, bone disease, spondylosis, poor posture etc.Visit a chiropractor to relieve the pressure and maybe it will temporarily help. For proper treatment you need to consult a neurologist. You have to discuss the best treatment option with a neurologist, which can range from medication to physiotherapy to traction, cervical collars or even surgery.Other than this numbness and tingling can be due to peripheral neuropathy of diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme's or lupus.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined as confirmed diagnosis is not possible on net. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you for replying. It makes me feel a little better. I go to a spine specialist tomorrow. I just wanted to make sure I didn't need to go to the emergency room tonight. My hands are still numb and fingers tingling. It doesn't hurt its just annoying and scared me a little. I think all of this is from one of my two clumsy accidents. I was talking to my husband while walking backwards down the hall way a couple months ago and stepped in my laundry basket which made me hit the floor like a ton of bricks. The other injury is a while back I climbed into my bantam chicken pen which is small and I raised up trying to catch one, needless to say I stuck a nail right on my spine. Both incidents make me laugh now but just wish I wouldn't hurt and could figure it out. It's like I told my family Dr pain medicine is not an option with me I want to know what the problem is before trying to treat it. Once again thank you for taking the time out to give me advice it lifts a weight off my shoulders.",
