At your age 'seriously wrong' is typcially not what's going on, so take a deep breath and relax a bit. Stressing yourself out isn't going to do your mind or your body any good.",

            "answer": "The gallbladder itself could be causing the pain. If you've got stones or sludge, and if that stuff is in the gallbladder itself or in the cystic duct or common bile duct, when those structures contract slightly to expel bile, it can hurt quite a bit. Or if the structures are experienicng a spasm same feeling can occur. For such 'tiny' structures they can cause one heck of a lot of discomfort.Try following a lot fat diet while you're trying to find out what's going on. Sometimes it can help if it is the gallbladder or biliary system.",
