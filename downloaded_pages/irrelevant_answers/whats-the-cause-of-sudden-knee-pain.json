Sudden onset knee pain is usually due to ligament tear, bursitis, meniscus injury or due to dislocation of patella. It can also be a slowly developing arthritis which has worsened. It is important to get an X-ray of both the knee joints. Please discuss this with her treating doctor. She may need some pain killers but the doctor has to assess her complete kidney function before prescribing that.
