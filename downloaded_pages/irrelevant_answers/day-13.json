            "answer": "Great job on lucky day 13! (I am so proud of you!)\u00a0\u00a0I am so sorry that you are having a hard time today. This is about the time in recovery that we really begin to feel those emotions that we've numbed out for so long. It can be very uncomfortable at first. The key for me was to learn to feel the\u00a0\u00a0emotions and let them pass through me, but not let them consume me. It's ok to have a bad day or days. We all do. It's ok to feel sad, angry, regretful, etc. Just remember that tomorrow is a new day, and hopefully a better one! If you feel like you are really stuck on something and can't seem to let it go, maybe try to journal about it. It can be very therapeutic. You can journal on here, or\u00a0\u00a0write it down on paper. I've even written letters to people and then proceeded to burn them! It felt fantastic! Sometimes all we need is to get it all out and vent. We are here for you. I hope that this passes soon. Sending you a big hug.",

            "answer": "Denise I am so following your progress as I feel I am in the same situation as you. I came on the site 2 days ago trying to see if there was any older people and seen your post. I am 73, was also very active with dancing, had been in a clogging club from 47 to 68 yr old, and social dancing. Eat right take vites and herbs, just had my old age planned, and not this way! The beginning was a fall on ice in 2008, broke shoulder in 4 places. That healed and pain meds not a issue. Time moves on, by 2009 I am bone on bone in the knees, and also dx with a autoimmune disease I had never heard of, Celiac, which was leaving me anemic, and just not well. I have that under control, I don't eat gluten. I had knee replacement a yr ago July had knee replacement and that was the beginning of a bad year. So sick for 3 months from increased pain med, no appetite lost 20lbs, and major fatigue. And now I have a new and very painful situation, tendonitis in my rotators cuff . I have also life issues that cause great stress, as a lot of us do. I lost my older daughter 10 yr ago at age 44. She had been a juvenile diabetic from age 3 1/2. When I get to feeling sorry for myself, I remind myself that she wanted to live, and would do it with pain. My only other daughter is 51, was pretty and smart, and is now a meth addict. Alcoholism and addiction is a family problem. I have guardianship of my 17 year old granddaughter, her daughter. Sorry for this long not to happy post, I just pray for everyone on this site that are trying so hard to change, it is not easy no matter how old you are! Keep up the good work all!!!",

When I get through all of this, I want to become very pro active in the way doctors give us pain pills so easily instead of giving us other options...These drugs are very addicting and easily ruin lives...I never even used to take an aspirin..On a positive note, we are here for each other and fighting the fight...I am so happy that I don't take those devil pills anymore...I noticed today that my headaches are no long present. I must have been getting those from the hydros...I really hope for some energy and I am in much pain especially my right hand and arm..I think I am going to need surgery..I take 2 Alieve in the morning and pool exercise and jacuzzi. I am NEVER taking any narcotic\u00a0\u00a0pain meds again...I am babbling again, I am sorry...Let's take good care of ourselves...Big Hugs my friend...",
