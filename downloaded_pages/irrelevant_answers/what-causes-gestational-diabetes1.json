            "answer": "The pancreas makes a hormone called insulin. Insulin helps your body properly use and store the sugar from the food you eat. This keeps your blood sugar level in a target range. When you are pregnant, the placenta makes hormones that can make it harder for insulin to work. This is called insulin resistance.A pregnant woman can get diabetes when her\u00a0pancreas\u00a0cannot make enough insulin to keep her blood sugar levels within a target range.",

            "answer": "Your digestion and whatnot change when you're pregnant. It slows way down and processes food differently. It led to gallstones for me last time (ouch!) But can also lead to your body not riding itself of sugars the way it should. This can cause problems for you and baby which is why it's tested for routinely. Your risk does go up if you are overweight or have a family history of diabetes.",

If so try to maintain your weight while pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Walking is an excellent way to keep pregnancy muscles strong and healthy. Also swap things with high sugars for fruits when having cravings. It runs in my family and so far I've been lucky but that is mainly because I'm considered to be in the healthy weight range!",

There isn't much you can do to prevent it. But if you do get it just watch what you eat. With this pregnancy I have a higher chance of getting. I hope the info I have gave you helps and best of luck.",

            "answer": "It's not always genetics and weight that cause diabetes in pregnant women. It has to do with your bodies ability to absorb insulin and how quick it absorbs it. My suggestion is to watch what you eat. Pregnancy is not an excuse to go crazy because what you eat your baby also consumes!",

I was 178 then and am 183 now according to my last weight in 2 weeks ago at appointment. I am 5\"7 and nobody can believe I weight what I do BC I wear 10s-13s. I wouldn't say im obese or even fat although now I feel like I am because of thickening of waist and my little pouch. I just tend to eat sweets when normal food makes me queasy and I can't get it down that's why I was worried",
