    "question": "I get really bad sugar cravings when I am on my period and I will eat so much that I feel like a complete slob. I get so bloated and nauseous but I still crave sugar. How can I stop this cycle? I feel like I have a sugar addiction but it is soooo much worse when my period comes around. And then I will get super hard on myself. Anyone else experience this? And if yes what do you do?",
