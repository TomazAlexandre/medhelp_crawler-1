Make sure you are trying during your ovulation-I know that sounds silly to tell you-maybe go to a website that helps you to figure out which days are your most fertile. I forget the one I went to but, there are many. My pregancies were harder to manage than say a non-diabetic, but I did it.\u00a0\u00a0I kept very tight control and had two healthy normal weight children-one was 6.13 ounces the other 7.03 ounces.\u00a0\u00a0I also saved the cord blood-maybe you will want to check into that as well!!!Good Luck!!\u00a0\u00a0Have fun trying--be romantic and try to enjoy!",

The pregnancies went well even back then. It will be even better for you in this modern day with all the new knowledge. Good control throughout is the key to good health for you and for your future children. I do so wish you good luck. Like you, I was frightened, but this was not necessary. All went very well. I am so glad that I took this step. I wish you the best.",
