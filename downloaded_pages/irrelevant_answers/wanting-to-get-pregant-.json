            "answer": "It is not normal not to get your periods regularly. I do not know what pill you take to get your period but most likely unless it is a fertility pill like clomid to induce ovulation, it will not help you get pregnant. I suggest that you see a reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist to do a complete history and physical exam as well as blood tests and pelvic ultrasound to help determine why you are not getting your periods. You may have a condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) which is a hormonal imbalance. PCOS can affect 5% of all women and common symptoms include irregular menstrual cycles, increased growth of hair on the body, loss of hair on the head, acne, and weight gain. Based on the 2003 ESHRE/ASRM sponsored Consensus Workshop Group, PCOS is diagnosed in women who meet two of the three following criteria: ovarian dysfunction (not ovulating regularly), hyperandrogenism (increased male type hormones on lab testing or clinically increased hair growth), or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (ovaries which show multiple small cysts on ultrasound). PCOS is a common cause of infertility and puts women at an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. There is also increased risk of insulin resistance, hypertension, and abnormalities of cholesterol and triglycerides in women with PCOS. Due to these risks, we advise our patients with PCOS to have the complete metabolic assessment with complete lipid panel testing and a two hour glucose tolerance test.Or you may have something call functional hypothalamic amenorrhea/stress-induced anovulation (FHA/SIA), a condition where the brain does not signal your ovaries to ovulate every month because of stressors.To repeat, I suggest that you see a reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist to determine why you are not having your periods and to obtain fertility treatment.",
