    "question": "Hello everyone, I am new to this website and not sure about forums but my friend told me about this and that it helps so here I am giving it a go.I am a member of a book club but was wondering if there was any recommendations on here for any good books about diabetes, both generic and specific. My current book club reads books for obvious reasons so i thought I would see if there is anything here?I recently read a book by M Zilber - \"High Blood Sugar find the cause and eliminate it\". It has changed my life from top to bottom. I have gone from reading numerous textbooks about diabetes coming out with more questions than answers to this little gem of a book. I don\u2019t understand medical terms and doctors speak very well and this book seemed to be written for me, or at least for people like me,The information was easy to absorb and helped me use it in a practical way to improve my own managment of my diabetes. It\u2019s a little bit zany at times and it often raised a chuckle or two from me. It\u2019s not a preaching book so to speak, it afford different options and opinions depending on your own particular circumstances. Overall a highly useful book that will afford you a better way of coping.",
