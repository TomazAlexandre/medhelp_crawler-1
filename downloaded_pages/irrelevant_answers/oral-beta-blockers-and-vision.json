    "question": "I have connective tissue problems (somewhat like Marfan syndrome) and have severe myopia (my contact lens prescription is currently -9.0 right eye, -9.5 left eye). Also some astigmatism.I've noticed my eyesight was stable at -8.0 each eye for several (about 4-5) years, then when I started taking beta blockers (Toprol and then Coreg) for my heart palpitations and aortic enlargement, my eyesight started to get worse. Over 1.5 years, it went from -8.0 to -8.5. I then doubled my beta blocker dosage, and my eyesight seems to have gotten worse very quickly (in a year, gone from -8.5 in each eye to -9.0 and -9.5). Have you heard of oral beta blockers like Coreg and Toprol causing this kind of problem? I am thinking it might be the culprit because my eyesight was stable for so long, and it started to get worse at the same time as when I started taking the meds. My main worry is that the eyes will continue to get worse and that I'll go blind, although my doc says my eyes are structurally healthy right now.Also, a question about contacts - I have mild astigmatism but don't wear toric lenses - I wear normal soft lenses. Sometimes the vision through a lens is CRYSTAL clear, like HDTV, and other times it's blurry. Is this more likely to be due to poor fitting/astigmatism or a vision problem itself?Thanks Doc!",
