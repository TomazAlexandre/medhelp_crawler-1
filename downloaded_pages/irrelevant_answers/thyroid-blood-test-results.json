            "answer": "Hey,If you tested positive for antibodies, it means that you have autoimmune thyroid disease.\u00a0\u00a0The fact that your tsh level is that high, means that you have hypothryoidism - and could have Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Your doc has most likely referred you to an endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0What are your symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes you can have high antibodies and normal tsh as well.\u00a0\u00a0Don't know much else to tell you other than make sure that you do some reading - here or elsewhere - and learn a little about that before you see your new doc.\u00a0\u00a0Knowledge is power on the part of the patient.\u00a0\u00a0Make yourself a file - get copies of all your test results - it helps sometimes to have these handy - if nothing else, but for yourself.\u00a0\u00a0If you have any further questions, you are in a good place!\u00a0\u00a0I will certainly help in any way that I can.\u00a0\u00a0Keep posting!Peace,Charley",

            "answer": "Thank you for your responses.\u00a0\u00a0You have definetly helped ease my mind.I really didn't realize I had symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I am always tired, but I just attributed that to my weight.\u00a0\u00a0Then of course my weight gain and inability to lose weight, but I just assumed I had a bad metabolism from years of yo-yo dieting.I am curious, my hips and back have been killing me for month's now.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be related?I am so looking forward to feeling great!\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't say normal, because I thought what I was feeling was normal!!Again, I appreciate your help on this. I feel soooo much better!!",

            "answer": "Hypo (whether caused by an autoimmune disorder or not) is treated with thyroid replacement (such as your Levothyroxine).\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor (hopefully you are seeing an endocrinologist) will want to adjust your medications to bring you into normal range.\u00a0\u00a0You dose of .88 every other day is quite conservative; possibly TOO conservative.If the Levoxyl isn't making the desired changes with a change in dosage your doctor will probably try you on another form of thyroid replacement medication.\u00a0\u00a0Many of us have been through at least 2 or 3 brands or types before we find the magic one (then just try to pry it out of our hands!!!)\u00a0\u00a0:-)",

            "answer": "Glad I could help.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know for sure but I do believe the bone pains can be related (often thyroid patients have other autoimmune problems like arthritis, fibromyalgia, etc.).Hey, you mentioned the weight gain - not fun is it?\u00a0\u00a0Please get your glucose levels checked - *many* of us thyroid patients develop Type II diabetes.You will feel better!\u00a0\u00a0I won't say \"normal\" because what really is \"normal\" but it will take a bit of time.\u00a0\u00a0Be patient but be persistent with your endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0Many of us have been through a few of them too before we found one who would treat us - not our lab results.Hang in there!",

    "question": "I have been taking Levoxyl for about 4 years now. My dose was slowly increasing, and my doctor most recently put me on .88 and 1 every other day.I went in for an exam with my primary doctor the other day, and she said that my thyroid was large.\u00a0\u00a0She ordered my blood work, and my doctor called today with the results.\u00a0\u00a0My antibodies were 11,000, and my TSH was 14.48.She has since referred me to a specialist.\u00a0\u00a0I am so concerned, as I do not know what to expect.If anyone has an advise they could give me, it would be greatly appreciated.Thank you!!",
