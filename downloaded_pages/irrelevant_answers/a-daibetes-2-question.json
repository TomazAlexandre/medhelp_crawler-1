            "answer": "I am not a physician, but the mom of a type 1one and the daughter of a type 2. First of all see if you can get Medicaid if you do not have insurance. People with chronic conditions like diabetes should never be with out insurance, as some insurance do not cover preexisting conditions fro up to 5 years. which means that you would have to pay for everything out of pocket.Hypothyroidism is what you are feeling the effects of.\u00a0\u00a0I had that before I had my thyroid removed due to thyroid cancer; they told me I was having effects of hypo thyroids.I would call your endocrinologist and see what they recommend, also if you do not have insurance tell the doctor and see if they can give your samples of the meds to help you out.I would also call the manufacturer and see if they have an assistance program.\u00a0\u00a0Most insurance companies do.Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Please stop back and le t us know how it goes.",

Medicaide isn't an option for me because i work and am over the age of 21 but i just heard of a program through a hospital that pays for almost everything. i might have a 10 dollar co-pay for visits and meds but that is close to nothing. thanks for the web sites i will defaintley check them out. It's great to know there are so many people who care and take the time to respond to qeustions, you all are greatly appreciated.",

            "answer": "Here is another suggestion: even though you are NOT a type 1 diabetic, and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation focuses only on type 1 issues, we DO have a staff member who handles all requests for information or help with lack of insurance. Please contact www.jdrf/org, go to the Online Diabetes Support Team link, and fill out a request to send to us. Tell us that you want information on help for lack of insurance, and our staff member will contact you. Also, you may want to check out the American Diabetes Association website to see if you can get some information on help with type 2 medications (www.ada.org).",

    "question": "I have posted a qeustion here before and got useful anserews, but I have been feeling horrible for the last couple weeks. About a 3 years ago I was diagnosed with hypothriodism and was put on synthriod .75 and about a year ago I was diagnosed with POS, and daibetes 2 and was put on metphormin 1000mg twice a day. i don't have insurance so i haven't been to the doctor in a while so i haven't been able to get the prescriptions. Long story short i haven't took the meds in over 6 months. I know that is bad, but I've scheduled a oppt.,, for 2 weeks. So my qeustion is i have been feeling so tierd. I get 8 hours of sleep a night but about 3 hours into the day i feel completley drained and at about 5:00 pm I can bearly keep my eyes open. I have been in a bad mood a lot lately and I have alot more headaches. I haven't had a period except for twice this year so far. I know that all this is symptoms of my diagnoses but i was wondering if there is any thing I can do or take until my oppt. to feel a little better. I still don't fully understand my diagnoses. And how safe is it to buy methformin and synthriod off the net? Thank you for your time and I'm sorry that this was so long.",
