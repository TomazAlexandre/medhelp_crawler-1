Ohh but yeahh the contractions are actually stronger more painful because they r being forced by inducing you :(.....My labor was 6hrs long that was it! I was soo happy cuz it went by soo fast compared to others that labor last for hrs & hrs or even days :\\\u00a0\u00a0& well as soon as a pushed my bby & the placenta i felt great i felt soo relax since i had her all natural without epidural or anything i felt great i wasnt feeling drowsy or anything just tired from the pushing..but besides that everything was great! :)",
