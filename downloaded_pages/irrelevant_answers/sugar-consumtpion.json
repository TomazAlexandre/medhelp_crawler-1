            "answer": "I think you know the answer to this LOL...\u00a0\u00a0But I think you probably want to know the details of why ;)1st all I can say is that you are on a fast track to being diabetic. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood.\u00a0\u00a0So it's your body's ability to deal with sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Try to think of it as a rubber band.\u00a0\u00a0Every time you consume something with sugar in it that rubber ban expands and then bounces back.\u00a0\u00a0As you age... The rubber of an over-used elastic band may become brittle and have less memory to it.\u00a0\u00a0Yet if you continue to consume sugar and force that weak elastic band to stretch & release over and over with every bit of sugar you introduce into your body... And you also have to remember carbs turn into sugar in your body too (especially things like instant rice, white bread), this puts yet more stress on that rubber band. One day it's NOT going to bounce back and THAT is when you become diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds simple doesn't it...\u00a0\u00a0That's because it really is ;)\u00a0\u00a0Every time you put sugar in your body, think of that rubber band.Also.\u00a0\u00a0You eat a sh*t load of refined sugar.\u00a0\u00a0That my friend is BAD.\u00a0\u00a0Not only does it totally lack nutrients but when you eat it, it actually robs your body of more nutrients, vitamins, minerals and enzymes. So, try to avoid products made with white sugar, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, sucrose, dextrose, fructose, and ALL artificial sweeteners.\u00a0\u00a0Try to replace refined sugar with natural sweeteners- stevia, Rapadura (dehydrated cane sugar juice), maple syrup, molasses, honey. Many health food stores offer products made with natural sweeteners, like cookies and ice cream...\u00a0\u00a0But even natural sugars have to be limited.My thinking is, you either make the change now when you are not diabetic and simply want to make the chage...\u00a0\u00a0Rather than later when you are diabetic and facing blindness, kidney failure, microvascular disease, atherosclerosis, infections, diabetic ketoacidosis, amputations....\u00a0\u00a0And much more.Taking control of sugar intake is HARD, especially in our society.\u00a0\u00a0But it can be done!!",

            "answer": "your best bet is to consult a physcian. it maybe leading to diabetes or it maybe something else. I do concur the other person. Limit yourself on the refine sugars, but eat a balance diet. In the past, people with diabetes were limited on what you can eat which is not true now days, keep in mind that our bodies burn rate is different and eating habits are too. This is a big factor on what age type 2 sets in. The other factor is how sediment you are. As long as you stay active, it helps in the long run.If and when you are diagnose with type 2, find out about the medication and inform the doctor when it disagrees with you. Some doctors will be pushy on what they want you to take. Try the medication and let the doctor know.",

    "question": "I consume mass amounts of sugar!\u00a0\u00a0Whether it be cool aid, sweet iced tea or in my coffee.\u00a0\u00a0The amount of white sugar that I consume in a week has to be harmful to me; or is it?\u00a0\u00a0I mean I can drink a whole pitcher of cool aid in a couple of hours and there's at least 1 1/4 cup of sugar in each pitcher.\u00a0\u00a0When I put sugar in my coffee I unscrew the sugar container to pour it in until I get the taste that I'm looking for.\u00a0\u00a0My question is this; what are the health risks of consuming all this sugar?\u00a0\u00a0I'm 38 years old and diabetes is very hereditary in my family.\u00a0\u00a0Grant you every time I've ever had my blood sugar tested it's been fine.\u00a0\u00a0I am however about 40 lbs over weight.\u00a0\u00a0What are your thoughts?\u00a0\u00a0Could this lead to diabetes in the future or does the amount of sugar that one consumes have anything to do with that?\u00a0\u00a0Please respond....",
