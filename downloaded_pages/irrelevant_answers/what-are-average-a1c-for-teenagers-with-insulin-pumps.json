            "answer": "Hello!\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes, and I definitely feel your pain.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter went on the insulin pump last fall, and managing her a1c isn't any easier.\u00a0\u00a0Simply going on a pump doesn't make managing diabetes easier, it just makes it easier to deal with corrections without needing shots.\u00a0\u00a0The carbs still need to be counted accurately, the basal rates still need to be on target, and the person with diabetes still needs to exercise.That being said, your kid's a1c's are good, and just like everyone else's, they can be better.\u00a0\u00a0Don't feel guilty that they aren't better, you are doing well to keep them as low as they are.\u00a0\u00a0To figure out how to improve, look at the factors you can control.\u00a0\u00a0Are your kids getting enough exercise?\u00a0\u00a0The fix for that is obvious!\u00a0\u00a0;-)\u00a0\u00a0Are you as accurate as possible with carb counting?\u00a0\u00a0Maybe consider getting an electronic scale to measure weights instead of just estimating carbs.\u00a0\u00a0All carbs are listed in ingredients as the amount by weight, so a scale can give a more accurate value.\u00a0\u00a0Can basal rates be tweaked?\u00a0\u00a0Do the carb ratios on the pump need to be tweaked?\u00a0\u00a0Look for patterns of highs or lows, and work with your endocrinologist to make adjustments.\u00a0\u00a0If your kids are in growth spurts or in pubert, that will affect their scores as well, so that's something else to keep in mind.Basically I'd say you are doing well, so don't feel bad about those a1c's.\u00a0\u00a0Just look for things which you can control and try to find ways to improve.\u00a0\u00a0Keep up the good work, and good luck!",

            "answer": "I am so impressed by the answer that RL gave you. I believe she is right on in her comments. We just have to look at each situation and try to make the best choices we can. There is usually some room for improvement in some area, so just carefully examine your current routines and see if there is something you can do a little better. The reality, though, is that you walk a tough road -- a balancing act, if you will -- between making your kids crazy by testing real often and adjusting and just letting things slide. The real improvement comes when they are old enough to take upon themselves the responsibility of testing before meals AND in between meals (about halfway between meals) and adjusting dosages.But it is very important to not become so worried over the numbers that the kids start to hide their tests or to rebel. So far, so good. It will get easier when they can shoulder some responsibility. It is very important to try to encourage this when you feel that they are ready.I write from the point of someone who was diagnosed at age 12 and was given that responsibility very early. My mom looked over my shoulder, but she taught that it was MY responsibility. And it worked. We do wish you the best. Just take each day at a time.",

    "question": "I have 2 kids on insulin pumps. As hard as I try to keep their sugars within normal limits their A1c's still run between 7.4 and 8.4. I was just wondering what other kids with pumps run. They are still way better than before the pump but as a\u00a0\u00a0single Mom I have alot of guilt that their A1c's aren't lower.",
