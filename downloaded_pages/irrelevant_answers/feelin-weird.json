            "answer": "Well, I requested an appt. regarding all of this. I was in & out of the Dr. recently for another issue & they were doing a lot of blood tests & the only unusual stuff they found was related to my other condition. I take B12 nearly every day (in the hopes it'll help my energy level). Wish me luck when I'm eventually able to get in to see the Dr.",

            "answer": "In case anyone was watchin' this or anything...I went to the Dr. this morning & was diagnosed with hypoglycemia. Turns out all of the things I do to try to keep from gaining weight is messing with my blood sugar. Recommendations: cookies, soda (yuck) & chocolate. Can't argue with that! ;-)",

    "question": "I'm going with \"spells of any sort\" because it's multiple symptoms. Someone suggested it might be thyroid-related, but my Dr's don't like it when we self-diagnose. I just want to know if it's worth bringing up: once in a while I get itchy; a strange stretchy/itchy sensation across my shoulderblades, weak legs, shaky extremities & the feeling like I can't remain upright. Eating something starchy sometimes helps, but it takes up to 45 min. for these feelings to go away. Any idea what it could be & if it's serious enough to \"trouble\" my Dr. about it?",
