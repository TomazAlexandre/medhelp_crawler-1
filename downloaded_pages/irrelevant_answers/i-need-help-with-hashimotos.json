            "answer": "also when was the last time you had your free T4,free T3 and TSH done. make sure they check your freeT3 atleast once also. ther are rare patients that only have elevated T3 levels and could cause your current symptoms. also with these symptoms an ekg and a consult with a cardiologist would be a good idea as well. hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Hi there. No I have never had oral thrush, but funny enough I was talking to a wholistic doctor two days ago and he said anyone with an auto-immune disease who gets oral thrush means they have a high yeast infection in their body that needs to be dealt with.I must be lucky, as I am on a gluten free diet so I think that\u00a0\u00a0has helped!Often anti-biotics can flare up thrush too. I DO get vaginal thrush on anti-biotics, but must admit, again, since being on a gluten-free diet,have not had that in years when taking anti-biotics.Hope that helps!",
