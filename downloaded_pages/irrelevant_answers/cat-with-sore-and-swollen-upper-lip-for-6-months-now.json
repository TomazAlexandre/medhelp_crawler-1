    "question": "My cat has had a sore on the top of her mouth for over 8 months. We have been to the Vet, and she is on Prednizone now for 5 months-no hlep. They suggested stainless bowl, so we go that, then change cat food to their prescription and she has been on 2 of them. It is a swollen upper lip which seems to have a blister on the \"thick part of the lip\"",
