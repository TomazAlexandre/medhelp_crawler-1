            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Well, not all human beings have the perfect bookish body temperature.\u00a0\u00a0A person can have a \u2018normal body temperature\u2019 that would become lower in certain instances. Another person can have a lower temperature without any cause.Since you have temperature fluctuations the first things to be ruled out are thyroid disorders, adrenal gland problems, anemia, diabetes, hypoglycemia and vasovagal attacks.Hope this helps. Take care!",
