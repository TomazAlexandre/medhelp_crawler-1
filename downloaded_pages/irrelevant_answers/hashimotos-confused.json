            "answer": "I feel so bad for you that you have felt that bad and your doctor won't take the time to care for you.\u00a0\u00a0The thyroiditis sounds like a very severe case.\u00a0\u00a0I'm guessing it was diagnosed as post-partum thyroiditis?\u00a0\u00a0I definitely agree w/ Venora on getting another endo and I always urge everyone to make sure it's someone that sees *lots* of thyroid patients.\u00a0\u00a0Endos who treat mainly diabetes are not usually great at treating thyroid problems.\u00a0\u00a0Like Venora said it may take 4 (sometimes 6) weeks for the medicine to fully kick in but at least now you'll know where you're starting from as opposed to what you were more than 2 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0If after the 4 weeks your tsh is coming down but not dramatically they may increase the dose to make the decline more rapid.\u00a0\u00a0If you need to know of a good endo you can always post another thread letting us know where you live; one of us may happen to live near you or know a good endo near you.\u00a0\u00a0Welcome to the board and please feel free to ask any questions\u00a0\u00a0you have.Rayne",

    "question": "i was dx'd with hashi's about 5 years ago. i had always been hypo and developed goiter. i had a nodule that was benign in one lobe that went away after treatment. i've had two children in the meantime. after my second child was born i had an episode of thyroiditis. i went extremely hyper and my neck became so swollen that i almost couldn't breathe. they had to put me on steroids to take the swelling down and they took me off my synthroid. i have been miserable for months. apparently when i had my levels drawn a little more than two months ago, my TSH was 20.6. does that even sound possible? the endo never followed up (kept cancelling appointments and doesn't give results over the phone). my primary doc gave me a script for 75mcg yesterday and redrew the TSH and i'm waiting to hear the results. i am just so confused. and i feel like ****....any ideas?",
