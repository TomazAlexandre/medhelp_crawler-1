    "question": "My boyfriend and the babies dad has only just started a new job with higher pay. Due to this he has missed 3 doctors appointments and an emergency scan. The thing is I don't want him to miss the 12 week scan and the 20 week scan. If he took in letters to his work would they let him have these days off or would he have to take a sick day? Just it's not fair that he hasn't seen or heard anything since I found out we were expecting and he has a right to know the details and information the doctor is giving me about his baby? Surely this should go down as an appointment and not sick day? Just that he won't get any salary if he takes a sick day and we need all the money he gets. Some work just aren't understanding enough.",
