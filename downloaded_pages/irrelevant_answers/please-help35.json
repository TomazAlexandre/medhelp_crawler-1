I couldn't eat and drink for 2 weeks lost 22 lbs. One thing they are good for giving pills. well i tried their pills and they about killed me and my liver. I made up in my mind that no more medicine until they can diagnois me.\u00a0\u00a0I still don't have a diagnois but am not taking any additional medicine. I have had all kinds of tests and now they found gall stones and i'm taking an ultrasound tomorrow to see whats happening with that.\u00a0\u00a0I started researching the internet and have made more progress that way.\u00a0\u00a0i found gall stones made my liver go from 40 to 140 way off that charts plus it can cause major vomiting and dirreah.\u00a0\u00a0I had to take assertive measures.\u00a0\u00a0It would be good to find friends and family that will pray with you. That is what has helped me trememdously.\u00a0\u00a0I make myself take naps to calm my nerves and me think straight too.\u00a0\u00a0During illnesses it is good to gather with positive people that care for you.\u00a0\u00a0I felt like i was dying to, but i began to pray and ask God to help me, He spoke to me and told me i wasn't going to die.\u00a0\u00a0It took a lot of fear out of me and helped my blood pressure go down.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not trying to shove religion on you but praying helped me a lot and now i'm getting answers.\u00a0\u00a0They tryed to put in in the stress box too and avoid a true diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0But i continued writing the primary care physician letting them know this isn't over, i can't eat yet and ect. I will definitely pray for you Davidjango. I pray God will give you peace and bring to light what is happening to you.\u00a0\u00a0Stress also can do a lot of terrible things to our bodies, that is why it is called the silent killer.\u00a0\u00a0So don't discard the need for calming.",
