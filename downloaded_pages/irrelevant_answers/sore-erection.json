He checked my urine again and said no infection was present but he said that I could have a small bladder infection or inflammation. So he is starting me on an antibiotic on Monday. Hope it stops it all. :)",

            "answer": "bladder and urinary tract infections normally do\u00a0\u00a0show up on the urine dip stick test.\u00a0\u00a0If not, it is better to get a urine sample to be sent off to the laboratory for more specific analysis and a more accurate result.Getting up a lot during the night to pee, can be from drinking too much before going to bed, having a prostate problem or having diabetes.Going for a pee a lot, especially at night can result if you eat a lot of sugary foods if you do have diabetes.If things settle down before you start to take an antibiotic, it may be better for you not to start taking it.\u00a0\u00a0Antibiotics can bring on fungal problems like Thrush.Should you take the antibiotics and your symptoms persist, it would be a good idea to get your prostate checked out (by physical examination and blood test) and have a HBA1C blood test done (or glucose intolerance test) to check out any possibility of diabetes or insulin resistance.Best wishes.",

He checked my prostate a week ago and said it felt healthy and completely normal.My symptoms have been on and off the past few days, but it's a frequent urge to urinate, especially at night. It's a feeling that I have to go again, but I know it's not a lot, but it feels uncomfortable if I have to hold it. So when I go I push and it just dribbles out. I then leak a lot in my boxer-briefs, like the urine sometimes gets trapped in my urethra. So I have to Milk it out sometimes if you will. Super annoying. I've NEVER had this problem before. I'm not diabetic either. Could this ALL be just anxiety???

            "answer": "I was doing more research on urethritis, and it also said Urinalysis is not a useful test in patients with urethritis. So that could be why I'm showing up clear all the time. It also said men can get it from having anal sex with their wife or whomever b/c of possible ecoli getting in there. =( I've had anal sex with my wife for years without a condom and never had this, but I guess it CAN happen.I slept better last night without having to get up an urinate but once this morning at 7am or so. Then I went back to bed and woke up at 12pm. I was tired. lol. And so far this morning I have no urge to urinate a lot. But it usually hits me more in the evenings.",

Prescribed which I start tomorrow, will take care of either one of these. :)",

    "question": "31 male (duh). lol. I went to the Doctor today, b/c for the past 4 weeks my Erection has been sore. It all started after my wife and I had vigorous sex for about 1 week straight. On the last night, we had anal sex, and it was kind of hard pushing it in and out.\u00a0\u00a0My erection has days where it doesn't seem to hurt at all, and some where it does, but I do overall feel like it's getting somewhat better, b/c it used to hurt in the base of my penis, where my penis meets my stomach, but that no longer seems to have pain when I have an erection. It used to hurt when having an erection and moving my erection up and down, left and right.Now the pain seems to be still, only when i have an erection, towards the top, just below the head of my penis.My Dr. did the regular checkup today, checked my balls, glands etc. but never really touched my penis. Even after I showed him where I have pain stemming from, at least I think where its stemming from.He then checked my prostate, and said it was perfect. Did a pee test for blood or infection, that was clear too.He honestly had no idea what it could be from, except from rough sex. He said you have ligaments, tendons etc. in there and you can strain/injure it.Do you think that's all it is? He never told me what I should do to let it heal. My common knowledge says to leave it alone for a while and stop messing with it. I've been taking vitamin E every day too.Thanks for your help. I hope it stops soon. I was worried about Peynieres Disease. I've always been kind of a lefty as it is.",
