            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for the update. You may also benefit from allergy testing to rule this out. Further evaluation may need to be done to determine the underlying cause. A second opinion may also help ease any worries. Hang on and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I've had a red bump on my leg by my ankle area front part of leg, that started out looking like a mosquito bite 12yrs.ago and it itches like crazy! I mean it REALLY ITCHES!!!!I first noticed it when I was in the hospital for the birth of my twins. Didn't really think anything of it til it just wasn't going away. Now I\u00a0\u00a0have been going to a Dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0but she has seen me for a 1 yr. now and keeps giving me shots for the itching but they aren't working either. It's only getting worse.\u00a0\u00a0She scaled off the top part of it to see if it was cancerous but I guess that it showed it wasn't, but I'm still thinking it maybe because now it won't heal up and it 's not only itching it's not healing up at all.\u00a0\u00a0What on earth could this be???\u00a0\u00a0If anyone can tell me anything I'd appreciate it!!!!",
