            "answer": "I definitely don't have all the answers to this as I'm in an ongoing struggle myself to get back my life and health but a lot of people who don't do well on T4 drugs alone (thyroxin) have major improvements when adding a T3 drug like Cytomel or Armour. I have problems using any synthetics so use Armour only (tried synthetics and have had major complications). Unfortunately a lot of doctors are given bad information that you don't need T3 drugs or that Armour is bad so if you come across that find a new doctor who will allow you to try it. Every person is different and if you can't even try something how will you ever know. There are a lot of hidden dangers to uncontrolled thyroid disease including heart disease, diabetes, etc & based on your symptoms it appears you're undertreated. Hope this information helps.Chel",

I went on a supplement package recently with great results. Fatigued to Fantastic by Enzymatic is what I am staying on for supplementation. I hate taking multiple pills and this is a Vit/Mineral drink I tolerate alot more.",
