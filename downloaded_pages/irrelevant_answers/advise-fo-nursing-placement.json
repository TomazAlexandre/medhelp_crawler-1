            "answer": "Hmm, this is certainly a different question!\u00a0\u00a0I tend to agree with them about not approving your placement until the cause is known.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry!\u00a0\u00a0:-)\u00a0\u00a0 If you were helping a patient, for instance, transfer from the bed to a wheelchair and then fainted in the middle of it, the patient could get hurt.\u00a0\u00a0You don't say exactly how often it happens but if you can't prevent ALL of the fainting, then it could be a risk.\u00a0\u00a0And btw, I have been an RN since 1970 (ack!), and I have never seen a nurse faint, so it is not common at all!",

            "answer": "I agree you are a risk factor, however there are many many nurses and doctors that are out there with medical issues that could cause them to injure a patient or themselves. like diabetes if they for someoreason drop their sugar. pregnant ladies could get sick while transferring. there are nurses that I know taht are prone to seizures, they are all suppose to be controlled bymedication but the danger is still thereI think in your case however there is no answer and even though you have been cleared abd these things are still happening you have no medical evidence that there are being taken care of. I was refused to nursing school due to the fact that I have tumors in my foot and I can not lift proprerly posing a high fall risk factor. I did fall with a patient wheen I was a LNA just simply transfering them with a gait belt on and transferring her from a regular chair to her wheelchair.good luck and I can see both sides of the issues.michelle",
