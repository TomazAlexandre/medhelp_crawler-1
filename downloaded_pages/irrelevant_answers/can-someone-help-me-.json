            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You should consult a diabetologist and a neurologist and assess whether you have poor glucose control. Glycosylated hemoglobin, 24 hour blood sugar monitoring etc should be done. In all probability you have persisting high levels of blood glucose. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Drnees advice was right on the money. You are experiencing the onset of diabetic neuropathy, which progresses with uncontrolled diabetes. Strict control of your blood sugar levels is essential. A supplement called alpha lipoic acid is also helpful. You need to be under close control. You know about the importance of diet. It is hard to follow these rules. But you MUST. There are diabetic clinics with fine specialists, usually RN's that provide this service. The treatment protocol involves frequent blood sugar sticks and careful documentation and\u00a0\u00a0tracking of food intake and exercise. You have a warning of ominous things that lie ahead. The memory loss, speech problems and trembling may be a result of poor glucose control and it may not. You clearly need a complete medical evaluation ASAP (as soon as possible). You might speak with your physician about other protocols, for example using LANTUS is addition to regular insulin, or perhaps, under clearly defined protocols short acting insulins, such as NOVALOG. Good luck.",
