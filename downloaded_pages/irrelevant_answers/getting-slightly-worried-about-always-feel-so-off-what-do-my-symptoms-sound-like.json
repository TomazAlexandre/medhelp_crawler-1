            "answer": "Sorry to hear that you have been feeling so unwell for such a long time.Unfortunately, my advice to you is that you MUST make an appointment and see the doctor.The symptoms that you mention make me think of diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, thrush, anaemia.\u00a0\u00a0Swelling of hands and feet is fluid retention.\u00a0\u00a0This may be due to your hormone levels.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes swollen feet can be indicative of kidney or heart problems.With Thrush, you can get this in your mouth as well as down below.\u00a0\u00a0So you will need a one dose oral capsule called Fluconazole which costs \u00a310 from the chemist without a prescription.\u00a0\u00a0Oral thrush medication is a gel called Daktarin for the mouth only and is about \u00a33-\u00a34 at the chemist.\u00a0\u00a0You can also buy Canesten from the chemist for vaginal problems.\u00a0\u00a0If you go for the Fluconazole, you won't need the other medications.The tiredness and feeling faint with breathlessness is likely to be that you are anaemic.Tiredness and being thirsty all the time can also indicate diabetes.Because you have a lot of issues going on.\u00a0\u00a0Make an appointment and see your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Write all the problems on a piece of paper and give it to the doctor.You will need to have a blood test to check you out for diabetes and anaemia and to check your hormone levels.\u00a0\u00a0A blood test can also be done to check your kidney and liver function.Your urine will need to be tested to rule out any urinary problems.The doctor may also send you for an ultrasound scan to make sure that your womb and ovaries are OK.The doctor can also prescribe an antibiotic for your chronic acne.Make sure that you drink plenty of fluids.\u00a0\u00a02-3 litres of water throughout the day.\u00a0\u00a0Eat a healthy and well balanced diet with fresh fruit and vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0Kidneys and liver contain a lot of iron.\u00a0\u00a0Keep off or cut down on junk food, fizzy drinks and processed and refined foods like chocolates, cakes, biscuits, etc.Let me know how you get on when you have seen your doctor.Wishing you a speedy recovery.",
