            "answer": "Are you Diabetic? Low blood sugar? That would be my first guess. Could be so many things including an electrolyte imbalance and thyroid function and adrenal problems. So I think you should see a dr and have some tests done if this is an ongoing problem. If your just having this right now for the first time and it is low blood sugar you should have some juice and some complex carbs. If you feel better it probably was low blood sugar. But you should still see a dr.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Shaky feelings are often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, poor sleep patterns, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. Certain epilepsies too could be the cause. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. You will need blood sugar monitoring, MRI of brain and cervical spine, T3, T4, TSH, sleep studies, serum electrolytes, brain EEG, etc to reach a diagnosis. Take care!",
