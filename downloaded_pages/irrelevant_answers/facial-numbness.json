            "answer": "I am happy to address the questions that you pose, although it is important that you recognize that my impression is based entirely on the information you have provided in your posting and is by no means a substitute for an office visit with a neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0Diagnosis is contingent on detailed history and physical exam and as such, the following information should be considered solely for educational purposes.The symptoms you are describing include sensory disturbance in the face associated sometimes with eye pain. a variety of conditions can cause similar symptoms. TIAs is a possibility, but it is unusual to get recurrent symptoms in the same area like this every time with a TIA, it simply means that the same blood supply is being affected by the process every time. quite atypical for a vascular process (like a TIA). by the way, actually a TIA can last for few minutes up to few hours.Now given the fact that your MRI, carotid imaging and echo all look fine, and assuming that you are otherwise a healthy person (no high blood pressure, diabetes or high cholesterol levels) your risk for having vascular problem shouldn't be higher than the average person. also conditions like demyelinating\u00a0\u00a0disease (Multiple sclerosis) are unlikely to be the cause with a normal MRI. so I believe these symptoms are more likely to reflect another process. one thing that comes to my mind is migraine. despite the fact that you did not describe having headaches, but sometimes you can get migraine variants that present with other symptoms like numbness, tingling or even weakness or visual changes. then the pain or the headache can occur later. you described some eye pain which could be part of that.I suggest you see a neurolgist to get more detailed history about these episodes, perform a thorough neurological examination and then may be arrange for some additional workup if needed. if these are indeed migraine episodes and they are bothering you significantly then there are medications that can be tried to control the symptoms.Thanks for using the forum. I hope you feel better soon. let me know if you have any further questions.",

            "answer": "Please ask your neurologist to test for trigeminal neuralgia or an atypical facial pain syndrome. Numbness is not a typical migraine syndrome; rather, bouts of numbness and/or pain are suggestive of compression or minor trauma to a facial nerve.\u00a0\u00a0Very often MRIs and other imaging tests fail to pick up relatively small areas of trauma or nerve degeneration. I am living with a scalp neuralgia that causes incredibly intense constant pain that responds only to strong narcotics and a few other meds, though my many MRIs and CTs have always been \"clear\".Neurologists do see an endless variety of migraine variants, but it is too soon to rule out neuropathic causes based on the history you've presented here.\u00a0\u00a0Please consider updating this post after you see a neurologist and find a treatment that gives relief. Your case is interesting enough that many people will certainly benefit from finding out what ultimately works for you.Thank you, and good luck!",

    "question": "Occasionally I get numbness that starts at lips on rt. side of face and continues to include most of right side of face. Sometimes get a pain in rt. eye. Lasts 1-2 hrs.Have had MRI, carotid test, echocardiogram and all are fine. I have allergies and sinus issues sometimes. What else should I pursue? TIA's don't last 1-2 hrs. do they?Any suggestions?",
