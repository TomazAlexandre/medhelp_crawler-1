    "question": "COMPLAINT -- I am 32 year old male with no prior problems with alcohol (and I am not an alcoholic; I am a social non-binge drinker), and quite suddenly I now have severe response to alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think this is true for all liquors (so far it is happened to me after red wine, and mixed drink with vodka khalua). On two or three occasions now I have had one or two drinks followed by a short-lived epside of difficulty breathing, wheezy feeling of short noneffective breath (lasts for 5 or 10 minutes), then my face feels warm, and soon enough splotches of warm, red skin particularly over my face, neck, and it seems to reach down splotchy across my chest, back, arms, and on my knees.\u00a0\u00a0It is also accompanied by a rapid heartrate of about 120 or 130 bpm.\u00a0\u00a0I will remain in this condition for an hour or two, I will get a very tired feeling usually as well. Eventually it just goes away completely.HISTORY -\u00a0\u00a0I am taking a slew of medications for my evergrowing list of problems (januvet for diabetes, humira shots for crohn's, isoniazid for a TBpositive test, prevacid for GERD).\u00a0\u00a0I am mildly overweight, non obese, but do have fatty liver and history of chronically mild ALT elevations.THOUGHTS - I have come up with the following possibilites, none of which seem to fit all that well, so I'm hoping for some help.\u00a0\u00a0First, though, is this dangerous????\u00a0\u00a0That aside, here is my list:\u00a0\u00a0(1) Something akin to the \"Asian Flush\" reaction (Pros - I do feel flush, in fact those who see it on my face say it looks like flush not like rash, only from alcohol) (Cons - that is a genetic thing relating to enzyme deficiency, I can't have new onset genetic problem, right? Plus its all over my body not just my face, and I think really it is splotchy even on my face it just bleeds together so it looks uniform; (2) Allergic Reaction (Pros - sort of looks like hives, the wheezing reaction to me suggests some type of histamine resposne) (cons - but hives should itch right? plus how could I suddenly get allergic to alcohol or some ingredient with alcohol?) (3) Some Liver Metabolic Problem -- perhaps my liver, which is chronically a mild problem with some odd liver pains, is just not as effective anymore given the strain from the medications or the diabetes or something, and the enzymes are just not up for the challenge anymore; or (4) Drug reaction - seems possible, but this new alcohol reaction did not start just after taking any of these drgus (though i have not been on these drugs long).Help! Is this a dangerous reaction or a sign of some other problem? Thanks for your time.",
