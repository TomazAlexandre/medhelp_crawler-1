            "answer": "Glad that your biopsy went smoothly... hopefully your results will be good news!Gallstones are not unusual with liver disease, as your doc says. Not the hottest topic in hep c research, but the association between hcv and gallstones has been around a while.\u00a0\u00a0Certainly not everyone with hep c gets gallstones, and though cause and effect has not yet been proven, most hepas nowadays do think there is a link:\"Hepatitis C virus infection is a risk factor for gallstone disease: a prospective hospital-based study of patients with chronic viral C hepatitis.\"Author: \tAcalovschi, M.;Buzas, C.;Radu, C.;Grigorescu, M., et al.Citation: \tJournal of Viral Hepatitis Dec.2009, Vol. 16 Issue 12, p 860-866Abstract: \tWe evaluated the prevalence and the risk factors for gallstone disease in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. We investigated 453 consecutively admitted patients with chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) (cirrhosis excluded) and 879 patients without liver disease (October 2006-April 2007). Gallstone disease was diagnosed if gallstones were present at ultrasonography or if there had been a previous cholecystectomy. Variables evaluated were age, gender, gallstone heredity, body mass index, waist circumference, parity, serum lipids, fatty liver, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome (International Diabetes Federation criteria). Informed consent was obtained from all patients. We found that 88 of 453 (19%) patients with chronic HCV hepatitis (age 50.1 +/- 11.7 years) and 153 of 879 (17%) controls (age 60.6 +/- 12.6 years) had gallstone disease (GD). Abdominal obesity (OR = 2.108, 95% CI 1.287-3.452) and steatosis (OR = 3.699, 95% CI 2.277-6 08) were risk factors for GD in HCV patients. Gallstone heredity, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome increased the risk for GD in controls vs HCV patients. Our study shows that even HCV patients with chronic hepatitis but not cirrhosis have an increased prevalence of gallstones. Compared with controls, gallstones are present in HCV patients at a younger age and are associated with central obesity and liver steatosis, but not with gallstone heredity, dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome. Although we could not establish a temporal relationship, the association between HCV infection and gall stone disease is real and appears to be causally linked, at least in predisposed individuals.\"HCV infection is a risk factor for gallstone disease in liver cirrhosis: an Italian epidemiological survey.\"Author: \tStroffolini, T.;Sagnelli, E.;Mele, A.;Cottone, C.;Almasio, P. L.; et al.Citation: \tJournal of Viral Hepatitis Sep 2007, Vol. 14 Issue 9, p 618-623Abstract: \tWe assessed the prevalence of gallbladder disease (i.e. gallstones plus cholecystectomy) among patients with liver disease and its association with the severity and aetiology of hepatic injury. Subjects, referred to 79 Italian hospitals, were enrolled in a 6-month period. The independent effect of the severity and aetiology of liver disease on gallstone disease prevalence was assessed by multiple logistic regression analysis. Overall, 4867 subjects tested anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive alone, 839 were hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) alone, and 652 had an excessive alcohol intake. The prevalence of gallstone disease was 23.3% in anti-HCV-positive patients, 12.4% in HBsAg positive and 24.2% in subjects reporting excessive alcohol intake, respectively. Gallstone disease prevalence increased by age in each aetiological category. The proportion of patients with gallstone disease who had a cholecystectomy was the highest in HCV+ subjects. After adjusting for the confounding effect of age and body mass index, compared with patients with less severe liver disease, subjects with HCV-related cirrhosis, but not those with alcohol-related cirrhosis, were more likely to have gallstone disease. Subjects with HCV-related cirrhosis (OR 2.13, 95% CI: 1.38-3.26) were more likely to have gallstone disease when compared with those with HBV-related cirrhosis. HCV infection is a risk factor for gallstone disease. In Italy, the high prevalence of HCV infection among cirrhotic patients has important implications, as cholecystectomy in these subjects is associated with high risk of morbidity and mortality. HCV-positive patients, 12.4% in HBsAg positive and 24.2% in subjects reporting excessive alcohol intake, respectively. Gallstone disease prevalence increased by age in each aetiological category. The proportion of patients with gallstone disease who had a cholecystectomy was the highest in HCV+ subjects.\"Roles of Infection, Inflammation, and the Immune System in Cholesterol Gallstone Formation\"Author: \tMaurer, KJ, Add.Author / Editor: \tCarey, MC;Fox, JGCitation: \tGASTROENTEROLOGY 136 (2): 425-440 FEB 2009Abstract: \tCholesterol gallstone formation is a complex process mediated by genetic and environmental factors. Until recently, the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones was not considered a valid topic of research interest. This review collates and interprets an extensive body of basic literature, some of which is not customarily considered to be related to cholelithogenesis, describing the multiple facets of the immune system that appear to be involved in cholesterol cholelithogenesis. A thorough understanding of the immune interactions with biliary lipids and cholecystocytes should modify current views of the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones, promote further research on the pathways involved, and lead to novel diagnostic tools, treatments, and preventive measures.",

    "question": "Hi all,had my liver biopsy yesterday, which btw was a peice of cake (if anyone is nervous about it, no need to worry at all, it was nothing!).\u00a0\u00a0they gave me some pain med, and and something to calm my nerves and some numbing agent, I just felt a little pressure and that was it.Anyway, when he was looking at the ultrasound to decide where to take the sample, he noticed i had gallstones, he said that that can happen with people with hep C, they are prone to that.\u00a0\u00a0Mine isn't bad enough to do surgery or anything yet, but he did see small ones in there.\u00a0\u00a0they don't really give me much problem, but at least now i know why I get the symptoms I get.My question is, does anyone know how long it takes to develop something like this?\u00a0\u00a0Would I have had to have hep C for a while for it to cause gallstones?\u00a0\u00a0Assuming that the hep C is the culpret that caused it.",
