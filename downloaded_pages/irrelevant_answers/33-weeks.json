            "answer": "This is my second child and just as my first I once again have gotten the gestational diabetes. They told me with my first son he was gonna be a big baby but he weighed 7lbs 10oz..at 40 weeks gestation. With the baby I'm carrying now at 34 weeks they told me he weighed 6lbs 11oz and that in a week he would weigh what my 1st one did at full term so because of his size and my diabetes and BP they are inducing me Monday at 37 weeks. Larger baits can happen when u have gd especially if ur sugar levels aren't at a steady level. All the extra sugar causes the baby to build up more fat than the average baby. However, because I am experienced from my last pregnancy I know and have been keeping my sugars at good levels and yet still my baby is messuring big. I was scared when they told me this but then the sent me to maternal fetal medicine and the dr. There told me my baby is just fine..is is just a big boy and they need to have me induced early because I don't want a c section and bigger babies have a risk of getting stick or having a birth injury. I wouldn't worry I'm sure ur Lil one is fine to. As long as u are doing ur part and managing ur diet..exercise and sugar levels everything will be ok. So stay postive! Congrats!",
