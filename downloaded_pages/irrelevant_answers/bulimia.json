            "answer": "HiThanks for the post! I am sorry to hear about your daughter and poor medical facilities in your area. I can see you have been seeking medical help without any solution to your daughter\u2019s problems. What you need is an eating disorder specialist, who is generally from the field of psychiatry or psychology. You could look up on the net for the specialists available in your area.Also if she is eating too much, it could be due to diabetes too. Have you got her blood sugar tested?What you can do is join some support groups, discuss your problems and try and find solutions. I am giving you a few links. You can find many more on the net.http://eating-disorder-recovery.suite101.com/article.cfm/eating_disorder_support_groupshttp://www.anad.org/The above link also has a list of sponsoring clinics. This is a non-profit organization. You could ask for a clinic nearest to you. A visit would be worth the trouble.http://psychcentral.com/resources/Eating_Disorders/Support_Groups/http://www.sedop.org/http://eatingdisorders.ucla.edu/Hope this helps you solve your daughter\u2019s problem. I think you should discuss this with your doctor and seek a referral for the specialist. Your daughter\u00a0\u00a0may need to undergo blood tests to rule out diabetes. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
