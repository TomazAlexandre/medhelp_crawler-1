            "answer": "Change your diet rapidly, and completely. It will be very hard at first, but you can get there. You might even feel pretty bad during the first week, but it is worth it. The following guidelines have been developed by a hospital in Germany for diabetes patients, and they called it LOGI (low gi). My Dad eats like this for 5 years, and he is pretty fine on it. I am a nutrition scientist, and I could not find anything wrong with it, either. Eat lost of fresh vegetables and fruits, snack on at least one handful of raw nuts like walnut, pecan or brasil nuts, eat at least two serves of fish a week, use olive or canola oil, eat lean cuts of meat, eggs, and low fat dairy. Cut your intake of sugar, honey and starches dramatically (no rice, no potatoes, no pasta, no bread). In a nutshell: increase protein, good fats and veggies, decrease bad fats and sugar/starch. This will keep you satiated, reduce your blood sugar, reduce your inflammation markers. Here some meal ideas: unsweetened low fat yoghurt with LSA or nuts and apples for breakfast, some eggs.\u00a0\u00a0A handful of nuts for a snack. Lunch: huge salad with mixed veggies and greens with thuna or a grilled steak. Celery with almond butter or carrots stick with hummus as a snack. beef stir fry with bok choi, broccoli, onions for dinner, or a steamed fish filet with roasted pumpkin, carrots and beetroot. Good luck! BTW, tell your GP that you will change your diet that way.",

I was very scared about my decision to do this but i guess the bottom line is if I didnt get it down(blood sugar), I would be worse off and with the hep c being elevated, Dr. felt best to get sugar level down fast or they wont even consider doing treatment for that, still have appt with gastro in couple of days.... thanks for all the answers, every one is right its just so hard to figure out what is best for me with all the issues i have going on .....",
