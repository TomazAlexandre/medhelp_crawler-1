            "answer": "Hello,You may have Myotonia congenita, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=gene&partid=1355it symtoms sometimes only appear during pregnancy, it is a rare congenital neuromuscular disease seen usually in starting in childhood but sometimes manifests later in life or since you say you have an Anti-Gad titer that is a good indicater along with the diabetes that you may have developed stiff person syndrome an equally rare disease through not herititary but autoimmune in nature and often associated with diabetes and other autoimmune disorders,http://rarediseases.about.com/od/rarediseasess/a/stiffperson.htmthis is a serious progressive neurological condition so please make sure to get to a good neurologist as soon as you can you need an EMG...It sounds like Myotonia, the anti-Gad could be a result of the diabetes regardless... so good luck..I hope you find a decent Neuro they are hard to come by.",

    "question": "Hello,I am a 31 year old female pregnant with my second child.\u00a0\u00a0Since the beginning of my pregnancy I have been suffering from a weird muscle stiffening issue.\u00a0\u00a0Such as, slow to release hand grip or a type of hand cramp where it contracts with movement then take a few seconds to release.\u00a0\u00a0Also, when I stand from a sitting position my legs muscles will freeze up and then relax after a few seconds.\u00a0\u00a0The same type of sensation happens when I'm driving and turn my head to change lanes.\u00a0\u00a0My neck muscle will freeze and then take a little while to relax to normal.At the beginning of my second trimester was the worst.\u00a0\u00a0I was having trouble walking down the street or climbing stairs.\u00a0\u00a0Even my toes would cramp and freeze when I would get out of the bath tub.I had spoken to my OB/GYN early in the pregnancy and she thought I was referring to leg cramps (i.e. \"Charlie Horse\") that often happen to pregnant women. She had suggested increasing foods high in magnesium, potassium and calcium.\u00a0\u00a0I am a pretty healthy eater and most of the items on the list she gave me were already in my regular diet.\u00a0\u00a0But these contractions are not sudden painful spasm type muscle contractions.\u00a0\u00a0They are even not that painful, more uncomfortable and interfere with my regular movement. I finally emailed her after two days of this intolerable stiffening. I saw another OB/GYN who stated that this was probably not gynecological and sent me to see my regular internist.\u00a0\u00a0My regular doctor did routine blood tests and checked for any vitamin deficiencies, which results were all within normal range.\u00a0\u00a0She suggested that since magnesium was in the lower region of normal I begin taking a low-grade supplement and see if it helped.Although the symptoms are not as severe as they have been in the beginning of my second-trimester they are still present. On another note, I have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes and am controlling it with diet.Finally, I got an appointment with Neurology.\u00a0\u00a0One of the blood tests that came back positive was that of anti-Gad.\u00a0\u00a0I know that this test has to do with diabetes, so maybe it is linked to my gestational diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m not really familiar and have been trying to understand this but can\u2019t seem to find enough information online.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Could the positive anti-Gad results have to do with my muscle stiffness?\u00a0\u00a0What does this result mean for my sugar intolerance after the birth of my child?\u00a0\u00a0Is there an indication that I will continue to have diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Any information on these subjects is greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/296583\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/296583</a>.",
