            "answer": "Diabetes can be hereditary.\u00a0\u00a0The disease is shown on both sides of my parental families.\u00a0\u00a0However, only my father, brother and myself have the disease (Type 2).\u00a0\u00a0My mothers brother (my uncle) also has Type 2.\u00a0\u00a0No other sibling shows any signs.\u00a0\u00a0The 3 men are of normal weight.\u00a0\u00a0Mine only appeared when I gained an enormous amount of weight.\u00a0\u00a0With one of my sisters it skipped a generation and her first born daughter has Type 1.\u00a0\u00a0It is my understanding that the disease has other considerations other than heredity.\u00a0\u00a0In some cases it depends upon weight, diet and other factors.\u00a0\u00a0If you are concerned, it would be best that your Physician test you for the disease.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to ask for a Fasting HbA1C blood test.\u00a0\u00a0It will show what your blood levels have been for the previous 3 months and give a good idea to your doc if further tests are necessary.Hopefully you will find that you are not Diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0While the disease is not painful, the maintenence required can really be a pain in the butt.\u00a0\u00a0You would really need to keep track of just about everything that goes into your mouth as I am sure your father can attest.Get those test done please and keep us posted here.\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Anita",

            "answer": "simple answer is yes.\u00a0\u00a0Long answer is you are more likely to get it with family history, so watch what you eat, exercise and maintain a healthy lifestyle and you can delay or stop it from happening.My sister in law works at NIH and is doing a very intense study on diabetes right now.\u00a0\u00a0There is something with zinc linked to it... I can't rember what she said though and there is a gene they found mutated in diabetics.Good luck",
