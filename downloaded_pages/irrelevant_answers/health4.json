            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!First of all treat yourself for heartburn by taking say Omeprazole 20 mg empty stomach in morning and an antacid gel after meals. Get yourself investigated for anemia, hypothyroidism and diabetes and if you are overweight, start an exercise regimen you can stick to. PCOS is another condition which can cause similar symptoms. If all these are normal, then possibility of anxiety and depression will need to be looked at.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
