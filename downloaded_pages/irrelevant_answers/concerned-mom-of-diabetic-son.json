    "question": "My son was diagnosed with JD when he was 15.\u00a0\u00a0He started out doing very well by keeping track of his sugars and taking his insulin as he was supposed to.\u00a0\u00a0Then he got very angry and choose not to take care of himself anymore.\u00a0\u00a0Needless to say he ended up in the hospital a number of times.\u00a0\u00a0Now he takes his insulin but never checks his sugar level.He is now an adult and doesn't have any health insurance but gets his insulin through the health clinic and Walmart for $20 a vial.\u00a0\u00a0I think if he had test strips to check his glucose levels he would check.\u00a0\u00a0He understands how important it is now and is getting scared due to some numbing in his toes.\u00a0\u00a0My questions is \"does anyone know how he can get test strips at a very discounted rate or even free?\"Thanks for you help, a very concerned Mom.",
