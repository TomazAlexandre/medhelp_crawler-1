Be carefull with your weight as it makes you crave carbs and can cause water rention but as long as your sensible you should be ok and im on a high does 450 mg a day but i had to build up to this, dont ever stop it too without reducing it slowly as it can be damaging.you can have side effects but these past and i feel far out weigh the pain that i was in before i took it.hope this helps",

Im not dx with anything yet iv undergone several tests brain and spine which came back clear im still waiting for my results of my LP and EMG and MRI of the pelvis.I came down with balance issues and mild nerve pain in Jan this year and then it got worse from there till May of this year i had to stop work i now walk with a cane and have to use a wheelchair when i go out.My Dad was a diabetic it came on suddenly for him after my mum died in 1999 and had to inject straight away he used to get such bad nerve pain in his feet he used to stick them in a bucket of ice, he never talked to the doctor about this and if he had im sure he could of got some medication for it.You have to increase the lyrica slowly i would tell the doctor that its not working and of the other nerve pain you are experiencing.You can chat to me anytime and PM if its easier.Take Care",

            "answer": "You do have to increase the dosage, usually one month at a time, until you get to a dosage that works for you. It helped me a lot, decreased my pain, and allowed me to swim and walk. Unfortunately I also have diabetes, and had too much weight gain, so stopped the lyrica. I'm seeing dr end of next week, and may ask to try it again. I think the benifits oudo the increase in weight.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't realise at time it would cause weight gain so didn't watch closly enough. Will try to do better next time. I used to have horses, rode a lot, raised cattle, etc. had 60 acres to take care of. Don't give up what you love to do. I have degenerative disc disease, neck fusion, diabetes, and fibro. If you feel like doing something, do it. Just do it in moderation. Good luck, and keep posting. Sometimes we don't always answer right away, but you are not alone out there. Prayers........",

There are also lots of support groups and forums out there for people with diabetes that you could join, there are some people on the MS forums that have diabetes and an old practising docotr Quix who has an amazing amount of info to give.Please dont get depressed Judy i am here for you whenever you need to talk, im sorry your husband is not more supportive, i dont have MSN.Its only nautural to feel down after being told this but in time you will get used to it and i find the best thing is get as much information about drugs and diet and exercise as possible so you can help yourself feel the best you possibly can in this situation.Take Care and keep in touchSamantha",

Avoid cookies, candy, cakes etc.\u00a0\u00a0If you must indulge limit it to one to satisfy your craving.\u00a0\u00a0Since your body doesn't use carbs correctly you will crave carbs because your body is looking for the sugar for energy.\u00a0\u00a0Your cells are line a ball and when working correctly the sugar will enter the ball through the wall adn get used for energy.\u00a0\u00a0When you are diabetic the cells wall doesn't allow the sugar to enter the ball so the sugar is just sitting on the outside wall of the ball waiting to enter which isn't going to happen.\u00a0\u00a0They build up on the outside of the wall untill the blood which is passing over it makes it come away from the outside wall of the cell and flow through your bloodstream.\u00a0\u00a0This is what makes too much sugar in your blood hence diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Don't be depressed.\u00a0\u00a0You don't have cancer.\u00a0\u00a0With a little education and good choices on what you eat you will be able to handle this.\u00a0\u00a0I went to a cookie exchange tonight with my book club.\u00a0\u00a0I did not make any cookies nor did I bring any home.\u00a0\u00a0I did taste a tiny piece of a cookie one lady raved about just to see if it was as good as she said.\u00a0\u00a0It was.\u00a0\u00a0I took a copy of the receipe and will see if I can modify it to work for my dietary needs. I didn't want to miss out on the conversation and good cheer just because I couldn't have the cookies.\u00a0\u00a0I could have made them and brought home the exchanged cookies but I knew my will power has it limits and I would have eaten what I shouldn't have.\u00a0\u00a0It was easier to not do the cookies.\u00a0\u00a0It is all about choices.\u00a0\u00a0But you do need to know how to make the right ones so you can make them.\u00a0\u00a0I will help you with any information I can.\u00a0\u00a0Just ask.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0You are not alone out there.\u00a0\u00a0I feel your frustration.",
