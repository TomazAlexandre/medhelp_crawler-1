            "answer": "HiThanks for the post! How are you now?Your symptoms could be due to anemia. A report of February is of no help. What was the report in October. Also please give the reference range your lab is using. Other than anemia your symptoms could be due to low or high BP, diabetes, fatigue, stress and improper sleep.I think you should discuss this with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining and results of various tests. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
