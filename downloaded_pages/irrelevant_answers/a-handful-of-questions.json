            "answer": "Hi\u00a0\u00a0Pat M.First I want to tell you that I am not a medical professional, so my advice/input is soley based on personal experience and knowledge and is not in place of medical advice.My son, now 9-1/2 was diagnosed at the age of 3.\u00a0\u00a0He is on the pump, as well, however, he has only been on it for a little under 2 months.\u00a0\u00a0My sister was diagnosed 8 yrs. ago at the age of 24.I just took a look at his leg where his infusion set is and I do not see any white bumps and honestly, have not noticed any thus far.While searching in regards to the bumps, this is what I found: (this info. can be found on page 3 at this url http://www.minimed.com/patientfam/pdf/tapetips_07.15.03.pdf)\"Proper infusion site selection and rotation promotes predictable insulin absorption and protects infusion sites from undesirable tissue changes such as hardening and bumps.\"\u00a0\u00a0Now, it did not say white bumps, so I am unsure if this is related to your situation.\u00a0\u00a0You might want to go to this page yourself and read all of the info.\u00a0\u00a0Also, on page 4 at this same address it states \"sites should be changed at least every 48-72 hours, or upon advice of your healthcare provider.\"I change my son's set every 3rd day.\u00a0\u00a0We changed his on Sat afternoon, so this afternoon is when we will change it again.As far as waking up when Low during sleep, I do know that my sister, like you, will have lows during the night that wake her, however, there have been times when my son was asleep and for some reason I decided to test him....maybe his forehead was sweaty when I checked on him or I had a gut feeling and he was low and asleep and I gently woke him and squirted frosting in his cheek and had him sip on a juicebox, so possibly everyone is different.I am looking forward to the day when this new device is on the market where you can set it to have an alarm go off at certain readings, such as 80 and 250.\u00a0\u00a0I do know that if I can get one of those for my son it will help alleviate night anxiety and school anxiety for me.As far as waiting and changing infusion sets on the 5th day, again we were told every 3 days.\u00a0\u00a0Someone else who posts here may have more info. for you, as we are new to the pump, but are very happy with it.Please keep checking back, as you will receive comments in regards to your questions.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry if I could not fully answer your questions.Keep taking care of yourself:)",

            "answer": "Well just to clarify on those little white dots. I've had them for a pretty long time (not sure exactly), so I'm pretty sure its no big deal. I actually changed from the Silouette to the Quickset about 5-6 months ago. That might be a reason. (The Quickset goes straight in, whereas the Silouette goes in at an angle.) I went to my 3 month checkup, and they looked at my site. (Not because I told them too, I guess they are required) They never said anything, so I assumed I was well. I don't see any drawbacks to them however. When I go for my next visit in early November, I'll ask them.",

            "answer": "Hi Pat :)I am not a physician, just a young type 1 DMer for 10 years and pumper for 2 years now.\u00a0\u00a0Due to financial reasons, I change my infusion site only when my bgs start going high, or I have pain at the site.\u00a0\u00a0I am by no means advocating this practice, as I am sure that it is probably not the safest method.\u00a0\u00a0I am lucky and have the advantage of online classes for school and I also work at home, so I am near my tester most of the time and can monitor my bgs closely.\u00a0\u00a0By only changing the sites when its high or painful, sometimes I only go 1-2 days, sometimes I go up to a week.\u00a0\u00a0Once again, I am not advocating this in any way!\u00a0\u00a0Just letting you know, that I myself, also use the infusion set for longer than the recommended length of time.Regarding your comment about waking up with low bgs.\u00a0\u00a0I almost always wake up when my bg goes below 50 at night (usually in a pool of sweat :P ), but there are times when I don't.\u00a0\u00a0You can refer to my previous post \"Low Blood Sugar Seizure\" as a kind of 'be careful' note, to not always depend on waking up when it begins to/does go low.\u00a0\u00a0As a precautionary measure, I won't go to bed unless my bg is above 100, you may want to discuss this with your endo.Lastly, about your 'bumps.'\u00a0\u00a0I have never heard of these before and I would definitly talk to your endo about them.\u00a0\u00a0This could be a possible minor allergic reaction to the adhesive or insulin (did you recently change to Novolog?), or it could be nothing at all!\u00a0\u00a0You can never know for sure without discussing this with your endo.Hope I've helped you in one way or another.\u00a0\u00a0My biggest advice to you, is to always discuss all your concerns with your endo, who has gone through extensive training, and should be able to answer all of your questions, or refer you to someone else who can.~vprrchk",

            "answer": "Hello again,I completely agree with vprrchk about not going to bed unless you are above 100.\u00a0\u00a0You\" meaning anyone living with diabetes:)I like to see my son around 125 or a bit higher at bedtime.\u00a0\u00a0 Before he started on the pump, I actually liked seeing his BG at about 180 before he went to bed since he was on NPH and I worried about it peaking during the night and causing him to go low, but now on the pump. for the most part if he is over 100 when he goes to bed, he is in good shape.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, if he had extra physical activity even in the late afternoon, I do worry about that kicking in later and causing a low, so on a day like that I might make sure he is 150-ish before going to bed.This may sound lame, however, how would someone living with diabetes know if every low woke them, unless they were monitored for several nights???\u00a0\u00a0There could be times at night that my son dips a little low and then that particular hormone (not sure of the name:) kicks in and brings him up.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes in that case he might wake up high...Take care and if you do find ut the culprit that is causing those little white bumps, pleasse post so we can all be enlightened.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!!",

            "answer": "Hi Pat,I am a long time DMer, and I don't use a pump(yet) so I can't comment on when to change sites. What I do have experience with, however, is adhesives and their effect on the skin. I can't wear bandages, or even hypoallergenic adhesives (EKG pads) on my skin for very long without experiencing irritation, itching and eventually bumps. These are often fluid filled and similar to what you might find with r first degree sunburn. You may wish to investigate whether you have or are developing a sensitivity or allergic reaction to the adhesive used with your infusion set. If this is the case, there may be alternatives that you are less sensitive to. If your physician cannot explain the cause and any possible complications, I would think you may wish to visit s dermatologist for evaluation of the cause. It is always best to know all you can about what is happening to your body, for as a diabetic you are your own primary caregiver. If you don't address it, no one else may.Good luck",

            "answer": "In regards to talking to your endo about those bumps:Long story, but I'll cut out all the long boring stuff.\u00a0\u00a0I started having, what my endo thought was hypersensitivity to insulin (which was pretty scary to me), and so she sent me to a dermatologist.\u00a0\u00a0There is actually a test that can be done, where they inject a little bit of the insulin (or maybe an ineffective version of the insulin, I'm not sure), on your forearm every 15 minutes, I think it was.\u00a0\u00a0Kind of like your other general allergy tests.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure they could do this for you for anything you think could be causing the bumps (adhesive, insulin, prep, or other), to find out what it is.~vprrchk",

    "question": "Hey.I've have diabetes for about 4 years now. I just had a few questions about some things. (Im on the Pump)1. I have these white dots around where my site is located. Are these normal?2. Do you always wake up when you are low while sleeping? I find this is the case for me.3. I use Novalog, which is supposed to be better for the skin. (It's basically the same as\u00a0\u00a0Humalog...eh, I'm sure all of you know) I usually go about five days between site changes. I see no infection, and my blood sugars are fine. Is this okay? I mean I know you are supposed to leave it in for a maximum of 3 days, but I see effect on me when I leave it in longer.That's all I can think of now, but maybe I'll think of more as I get responses.Thanks everyone. :)",
