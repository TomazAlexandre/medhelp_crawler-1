            "answer": "Welcome back to the forum.Testicular pain plus urethral discharge are definitely reasons to be concerned about an STD and to see a health care provider ASAP; it raises concerns about epididymitis, a testicular infection.\u00a0\u00a0Above age 35, the majority of epididymitis is not due to STD; in younger men and especially under age 30, most cases are due to gonorrhea or chlamydia.\u00a0\u00a0Had you sought my advice when you had those symptoms, I would have advised prompt medical evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, since they have faded, it's very unlikely you had epididymitis.\u00a0\u00a0You might have had a flare in your prostatitis, which could cause all the symptoms you mention, with no STD problem at all.\u00a0\u00a0Beyond that, it's awfully difficult to judge whether there is currently anything to be concerned about.As for one of your partner's symptoms, vaginal discharge with odor indeed can be evidence of an infection.\u00a0\u00a0As with epididymitis, there are both STD and non-STD infections that could be responsible.\u00a0\u00a0I have no way of judging at this point.You are clearly at risk for STDs, as is anybody who has unprotecgted sex with two different partners in a short period of time.\u00a0\u00a0On that basis alone, you should have periodic testing for common STDs like gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis and HIV.\u00a0\u00a0So if you haven't been evaluated for STDs recently, this would be a good time.\u00a0\u00a0Your situation is complicated by your prior prostate gland problem -- making it even more difficult for any distant, online resource to judge what's going on.As for your numbered issues, I have addressed the potential interaction with your prostate gland problem.\u00a0\u00a0Your diabetes probably isn't relevant, although it might increase the chance of a bacterial (non-STD) urinary tract infection.\u00a0\u00a0However, this depends on how well your diabetes is controlled.\u00a0\u00a0That one partner had negative STD testing is reassuring, but doesn't help me assess your situation. The other partner's thyroid condition is irrelevant.Bottom line:\u00a0\u00a0See your prostate and/or diabetes doctor or clinic and get tested for STDs.\u00a0\u00a0My guess is that the results will be negative, but better safe than sorry.Regards--\u00a0\u00a0HHH, MD",

            "answer": "Thank you I just want to add that, girl #2 has no discharge but a foul odor durning menstruation only. The sore testicles seem and my discharge seems to be something that happens in the summer time to me and the discharge seem more seamen colored most of the time and comes when I sit down for long periods of time. Also girl#1 told me she was retested in September and everything was negative(if I can believe that) but reassuring and like you said everything will probably turn ok. Bottom line I am going to get tested and I'll let you know the results. Thank you.",

    "question": "Had unprotected sex on June17th 2010 with girl #1. Then had sex unprotected with girl #2 on June 24th, one day late gilr #2 had her menstral cycle which went on for 2 weeks and she said that had never happen before. Had no symptoms until girl #2 told me about the extended menstral cycle. At that time I had some pain in my right testicle for about 2 or 3 weeks, and some white discharge(is something I've had happen before). After I convinced my self I didn't have anything the symptoms kinda of went away. Now it's 4 months later girl #2 had had a unusual foul smelling abnormal menstral cycle for the past 2 months the smell is only when she has her cycle, no discharge no pain during voiding or other symtoms. Her Doctor told her it might be a infection or a clot caused by her IUD...1. I am a diabetic2. I have prostate problems(which I have had for years, no BPH but problem voiding)3. Girl #1 had STD testing in April( all negative)4. Girl #2 has a Thyroid problem that might be uncontrolledGive me your opinion if you think I have a STD or is it just a coincidence?",
