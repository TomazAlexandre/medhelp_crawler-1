    "question": "This is my second pregnancy and I had an apt yesterday. He said he was going to do another ultrasound next visit to check fluid and the size of the baby. I didn't have this with my first. With her, the last ultrasound was at 20 weeks. Is this normal or should I be worried something is wrong? He didn't say anything was but other people keep asking me if everything is ok when I tell them and it's worrying me! Any help appreciated",
