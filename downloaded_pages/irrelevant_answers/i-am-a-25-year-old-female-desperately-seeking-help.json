            "answer": "Hello~I am sorry you are experiencing all of these symptoms. The first thought that came to my mind was Fibromyalgia or Chronic Fatigue, were you tested for these? Also, not to alarm you, but MS can have these symptoms as well, if you have not seen a neurologist, I would suggest you do so.I would also suggest seeing a chiropractor, you may have some pinched nerves in your neck and spine that are causing some of the symptoms.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your response. I was hoping to hear some theories that didn&#39;t involve malignancies. I am very worried. My neurologist has scheduled me for an MRI of my spine. Hopefully it will reveal the problem and not be another waste of money. :(",
