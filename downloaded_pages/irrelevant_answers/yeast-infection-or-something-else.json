            "answer": "Hi,Yeast infection is best diagnosed on a wet smear and not on a pap test. Repeated yeast infection is a sign of decreased immunity and hence you need to rule out anaemia, chronic infection in the body and diabetes. Taking of multi-vitamin supplements and having a healthy diet will help. Also vaginal pessary and keeping the area clean and dry will help. Consult your Doctor. Hope this helps.The answer is based on information provided. Exact advice is not possible without a proper examination and investigations. You are requested to consult your Doctor. Take care and keep us posted.",
