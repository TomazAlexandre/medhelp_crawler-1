    "question": "I am a 55 year old male diabetic type 1. I was diagnosed with type 1, 25 years ago.Last june my GP advised me to start taking zokor 20 mgs to lower my cholesterol levels. Total cholesterol was 5.02 and LDL was 3.42. Normal levels are\u00a0\u00a0between 2- 5 and between 0.10 - 3.88.\u00a0\u00a0Liver ALT was 48. (normal levels are between 4-41).My Bilirubin was reading 25.7. Normal reading is between 1.72 - 17.10. I have always had high bilirubin readings. I think they call it gilbert`s syndrome.We did another blood test after about 2.5 months and ALT went up to 91 and bilirubin was 34.4.We did another blood test after another 2 months and ALT went up to 125 and bilirubin was 20.5Tests for Hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. But ASMA test was positive ++.GP told me to stop taking Zokor immediately.I know that a side effect of Zokor is to raise ALT levels. But does zokor also raise ASMA levels?Thanks for your patience.",
