With my second baby I did a little research and found untreated diabetes can be damaging to the baby and even lead to fetal death and actually took the test correctly, failed of course, and underwent the treatment for diabetes. It wasn't fun but I knew my baby was healthy AND sticking to the healthy diet kept my weight gain down a lot from the end of my first pregnancy",

I'm not wanting to \"cheat\" since I would just like a healthier reading next time and obviosly throughout the ENTIRE pregnancy. Would like to know from others who have not passed what you can do to avoid it getting out of control. I was a lot healthier and active my first pregnancy so I'm slightly worried this time around about what this could mean in the long run.",

Lots of veggies and protiens- lean meats, cheese,\u00a0\u00a0eggs. You should be careful with fruit because that raises your blood sugar also. Limit pasta, rice and potatoes.\u00a0\u00a0Switch to whole wheat versions when you do have them. Limit fruit juices as well and of course soda.It's tough, I'm struggling get with it myself.\u00a0\u00a0But anything to keep my baby healthy.\u00a0\u00a0Take it easy mama",
