            "answer": "Hello,Excessive thirst is called polydipsia medically. Excessive thirst is common after eating salty and spicy food.This is because salt which contains sodium and chloride,the body uses water to flush extra sodium away and hence one feels thirsty.There is no proven remedy as such which can be a remedy for excessive thirst except water ,but it has been found that adding a wedge of lemon or orange peel, a sprig of mint or\u00a0\u00a0fresh coriander to water helps a lot. Drinking plenty of non-caffeinated fluids, such as tender coconut water, fresh lime water, butter milk or milk shakes also helps.But if the symptom of excessive thirst persists then diabetes has to be ruled out.Also other conditions that need to be ruled out are hypokalemia and diabetes insipidus.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I recently did a blood test to check for thyroid and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Everything came back fine.I recently got a UTI and was put on Cipro. Had slight reaction to the medication so my GP told me to stop using it (after 5 days).\u00a0\u00a0For the past 4 days I have been feeling very thirsty. I feel like I cant get enough water.\u00a0\u00a0I just drink, drink, drink.\u00a0\u00a0And I normally drink about 6-8 glasses of water daily so I doubt that I am dehydrated. If I am not diabetic,\u00a0\u00a0what could be causing this excessive thirst issue?\u00a0\u00a0Any tips on how to cure this?",
