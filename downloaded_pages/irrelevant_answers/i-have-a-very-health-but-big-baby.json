    "question": "My son was born 3.2kg's. He is now 7monthes and is over 16kg's. during my pregnancey i couldnt eat and struggled with 1meal a day. My baby is a good eater but doesnt drink to much then normal. I give him water with his solids. he has only just started sleeping thru the nite. A lot of people tell me i must be over feeding him for him to be so big. he's now almost outgrown size 3 (which really should fit a 3year old) im 6'1in height and med build and my husband is 6'4 (hes also a maori from new zealand) and a large build we r very broard people. my son is also very long and has an over average size head, but it fits with his length n weight oh and he has very long feet. Could he have any underlying medical conditions which is making him grow so fast? I know babies r supposed to grow but he's grom from 5 o clothing to now almost a size 4 in 7 months, thats 7 sizes",
