Maybe you should get some blood drawn to check your levels.\u00a0\u00a0Why would your doctor think you are looking for a fix?\u00a0\u00a0Maybe try a different doctor?Take care, and I hope you feel better.",

            "answer": "Sometimes I've heard that people have these w/d symptoms months after they've been clean. But from what I've heard, it's mild but comes out of the blue. I'm just into my 25th day but I have felt residual w/d symptoms myself even after the worst first week. Not sure why that happens. Other recovering addicts have told me the same thing after many months. It is mild but still disturbing. Our brains must still be healing our brain chem changes. Maybe someone who knows more will be around to offer advice. Great job on 8 months! I'm not a doc but just relaying what several people have told me.",

Can cause headaches,severe lethargy,shakes. I've had hypoglycaemia since I was 10. I'd deff go see a doctor and get a bunch of tests done.",

I guess mostly I'm just ashamed and overly critical of myself. :/ I guess I'll just have to suck it up and make an appointment. It's been almost 8 months, I just want to be normal again.",

I have felt the exact same way before.\u00a0\u00a0I guess my thought now is, so what?\u00a0\u00a0The bottom line is that you are clean now, and you may have a medical issue that is unrelated to your addiction.\u00a0\u00a0These days I think doctors see this situation a lot. Please don't let this keep you from seeing a doctor. Be happy and proud of what you have been through and what you have accomplished.\u00a0\u00a0Addiction is not something that we have to spend the rest of our lives being ashamed of.\u00a0\u00a0That being said, I get how you are feeling.

            "answer": "Well thats just it.. relapse. Ive stayed clean solid without any slips. Im hopeful that others will give it a shot a normal life and OD one day. Ive seen way too many try to do it cold turkey without the help of a drug treatment/program. Im not trying to cause harm. Just help. Ive lost way too many friends who redused to \"substitute\" one drug for another because they've heard that way too many times. If being off an opiate is something you truly want, then a methadone or suboxone program would work wonders. So please dont turn something innocent into something other. Like I said, harm is furthest from my intention. I feel that not enough addicts know about Methadone or Suboxone. Had I know ten years prior to starting the Methadone program I would have done it way sooner.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes to all..",

    "question": "on the 25th of this month it will be my 8 month anniversary of going CT from methadone and percocets. I don't think I'm in danger of using as I've cut out everyone from that life. I couldn't even talk to those people if I wanted to. So here's the issue: lately I've been feeling like I'm in withdrawal again. I have a hard time getting motivated, I have 0 energy, very light sleep, body aches and pains, and horrible headaches. I just do what I've been doing, just soldier on. It's getting to the point where I'm not sure if something may actually be wrong with me. I just don't want to go to the dr and have yet another person look at me like I'm the scum of the earth looking for a fix. I refuse to do that ever again. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there anything I can do??",
