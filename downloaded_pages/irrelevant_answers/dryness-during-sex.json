            "answer": "Hello,High levels of stress are responsible for causing such vaginal dryness. It is true that decreased estrogen levels is the principal cause of vaginal dryness but other conditions like Sjogren\u2019s syndrome also need to be probed thoroughly. Dryness of vagina is also a manifestation of diabetes. So please get your blood sugar levels and HB a1C levels done.Allergies like soap allergy, hygiene products, douches and perfume allergy in some of the cosmetics can also contribute to vaginal dryness. Try using mild soaps like dove and avoid dousing the area. Also wear cotton clothes and change your undergarments twice a day. Apart from these, endocrine abnormalities like prolactinemia, Hypergonadotropic ovarian failure, Lactotroph adenoma , Panhypopituitarism and premature menopause may cause vaginal dryness. My sincere advice is to consult an endocrinologist apart from a gynecologist to rule out these conditions.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
