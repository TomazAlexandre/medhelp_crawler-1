            "answer": "Yeah its really hard for me too keep up with numbers too. As long as your borderline and not full blown my doc said I can just take it easy on everything white and anything fried or sweet. ( breads, crackers, rice, potatoes **starches & cards. , fried foods aren't healthy anyways plus they can give u severe reflux or heartburn, and sugars clearly you're temporarily diabetic you shouldn't be eating to much sugar! Fruits and juices included. Now this is not saying that you have to completely cut all these foods off your menu but lessen them as much as possible BCUZ if you over indulge and don't pay any attention to what you eat it can increase your babies weight..Ur amount of water surrounding your baby..and cause the baby to have obesity issues as a child and or adult.",

            "answer": "Thanks ladies! I've been checking 3 times a day, alternating between testing before and after meals. Had to be under 5.8 before a meal and under 7.8 after a meal. I managed to find an online shop which stocks sugar free, carb free and no added sugar items-don't know what I'd do without chocolate!I've learned about glycemic load, which means even when something is low in carbs and sugar it can hit quicker than something which appears to be higher. Just to make matters more confusing. I also found that high fat items reduce the speed at which carbs are absorbed-so having cheese with your carbs technically means you could have more!Only 6 or so weeks till I'll be back on the chocolate!Anyone else been told they're being induced early?",

    "question": "Anyone else been diagnosed with gestational diabetes? This is my 2nd pregnancy and I wasn't offered the glucose tolerance test with my first. I am only borderline but finding it a tad difficult to gauge my carb and sugar intake. Getting a little nervous about risks tho and being induced-they're currently saying they'll induce me a week early.",
