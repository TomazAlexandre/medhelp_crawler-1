If HBSAG drops sequentially, the chances are high that virus is seroconverting.)yes and no, hbsag can stay at 10iu/ml for 5 to 10years without any immune modulation push.it is decreasing but we dont know the time to clear2. If not, Shall I take some medications to assist the process??peginterferon plus simvastatin and then update us on results, you ll sure clear hbsag by 48weeks if not less",

My docs sound confident in not recommending anything as my virus is silent!You suggest that there could be side effects.
