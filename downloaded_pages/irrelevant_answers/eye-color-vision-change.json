    "question": "Hello. I am 20 years old and I have a question about my color vision changing. I noticed that every once and a while I will notice that one eye sees everything in a shade of red, while the other eye seems to see colors normally. I can tell colors apart but if I was looking at a white piece of paper or a white wall, one eye will see it (and all other things) in a shade of red. This also happens sometimes when I wake up in the morning. If i'm laying on my left side, then my left eye will see things in a shade of red. If i turned on the right side, after a while my right eye will see in a shade of red. It goes away after a while (it lasts for about 10 min. when i notice it) but I dont know what it is. I also dont know if it's something I should worry about.",
