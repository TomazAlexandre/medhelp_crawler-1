            "answer": "It depends on how old the child is, but if she is old enough to help manage her blood glucose, you may want to look in to getting her on an insulin pump.\u00a0\u00a0When on a pump she CAN have some of the foods that aren't the greatest, as long as she just puts a bolus figure in to the pump, so no more \"sneaking\" needed.\u00a0\u00a0(Even if she isn't old enough to bolus herself, if you make it clear that she can have \"treats\" occasionally as long as she tells you what she wants to eat, with a pump it's no big deal.)\u00a0\u00a0Our now 11 month old is on an Animus Ping pump and it's great... of course we aim to feed him healthy food most times, but if he sees his 2 year old older brother eating a cookie, of course he wants one too.Other than that, you'll need to make sure that she gets daily exercise and eating a good breakfast is also very important.\u00a0\u00a0Be mentally prepared that you will be having to count carbs for EVERYTHING she eats (and I've found our family in general eats better now that we are reading food labels!), that you'll inevitably have to deal with highs and lows, that you'll be taking her for regular endocrinologist check-ups every 3 months, and that there can be complications if her blood glucose isn't controlled.\u00a0\u00a0However, the most important thing is to think about the child first-- and not the disease!\u00a0\u00a0If she tugs at your heart, go for it and don't let the disease stop you.\u00a0\u00a0JD isn't the end of the world, and it doesn't define the child.\u00a0\u00a0Check out the JDRF.org website for lots of info about the disease, and the latest on the research for a cure.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully within the next few years there will be an artificial pancreas on the market and these kids won't have to be pricking their finger and self-administering insulin.\u00a0\u00a0My best advice is that if you love the child, JD is just a minor inconvenience that any parent can learn to deal with.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

            "answer": "I am really pleased to read your post and to know that there are still people with good hearts out there!\u00a0\u00a0I am the mother to two children with type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter is age 10 and was diagnosed with this illness at the age of 2.\u00a0\u00a0She has been on the whole range of treatment and is currently on a Medtronic insulin pump.\u00a0\u00a0My son on the other hand is age 14 and was diagnosed at the age of 12.\u00a0\u00a0He is on multiple daily injections.\u00a0\u00a0Both children live life to the fullest.\u00a0\u00a0There are a lot of ways to overcome the candy jar problem.\u00a0\u00a0This child does not necessarily have to go on an insulin pump to achieve this but with a bit of education from the dietician learn the best way to deal with this addiction.\u00a0\u00a0A banned candy jar will definitely make it more attractive!!I totally agree that if you love the child JD is just a minor inconvenience!\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes has made us have a far closer bond with our children as they are so dependent upon you to assist them with various aspects be it hypos, school issues, bullying or whatever.\u00a0\u00a0All the child needs is routine and stability and the rest will follow.\u00a0\u00a0These children have to cope with huge responsibilities and\u00a0\u00a0I think it is fantastic that you are considering adopting a child with this problem, what a nice person you must be.Good luck, I am sure you will find caring for this child very rewarding and I look forward to hear how you get on.",

            "answer": "Thank you both! We consider us the lucky ones but our friends just call us crazy. :) We have had an empty nest for YEARS! We have 4 grown boys and it has been soooo quiet. (Enter cricket sounds) We are hoping to be chosen for the little lady with JD and her sister. We should know in a few weeks if we get to meet them. So we have gotten a tease of information and pictures. OMG! They are sooo cute! We look at their pictures several times a day and just wonder how they are doing. Oh, and we have been brushing up on Hannah Montanna.",

    "question": "Hi everyone! We are trying to adopt and have just gotten info on an older child with JD. Has issues with sneaking things she shouldn't have (which I am sure a lot of kids do). We have so many questions and are trying to picture if we can provide this child with a home that would be deserving. We know the simple things will have to occur ie: get rid of the candy jar! Watch carbs.\u00a0\u00a0What advise would you give us?Thank you!",
