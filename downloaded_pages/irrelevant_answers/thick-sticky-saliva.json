            "answer": "Hello,I cannot confirm anything without examination but it sounds like chronic gingivitis. Gingivitis is an inflammatory process limited to the mucosal epithelial tissue surrounding the cervical portion of the teeth and the alveolar processes.Other possibilities are chronic sinusitis, taking some medicines like diuretics, antihistamines, antidepressants and muscle relaxants, Diabetes and hypothyroidism, nerve (to salivary glands) damage, Autoimmune conditions such as Sjogren's syndrome and sarcoidosis - the inflammation of body tissue.I feel that you should get yourself thoroughly examined by a physician/dentist and start with the treatment. Till that time, chew sugar free gum or suck on sugar free sweets and drink plenty of water and avoid caffeine drinks.Pls don\u2019t smoke tobacco or drink alcohol and brush and floss thoroughly and regularly to avoid a build up of plaque which leads to tooth decay.Hope it helps. Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.Kind regards",
