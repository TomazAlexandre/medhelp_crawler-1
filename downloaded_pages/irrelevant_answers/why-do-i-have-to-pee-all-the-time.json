            "answer": "Hello,What you seem to be having is called polyuria.It can be due to excessive consumption of fluids, intake of diuretic fluids like caffeine, chocolate, coffee, tea, soft drinks, hot spicy foods; juices high in acid and alcoholic beverages. It can also occur in diabetes and high doses of vit C and B2.Pls check out if there is any intake of the above said medicines or foods.Aldara is not shown to cause any increase in frequency of urination although it can cause increased chances of UTI which in turn cause poyuria.If the symptoms persist then pls get it evaluated from a physician and get ruled out the various medical conditions causing polyuria.I hope it helps. Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts.Kind regards.",

            "answer": "well, i've tried changing my diet and I can't seem to loose the feeling that I have to pee a lot. It doesn't feel like an emergency, and sometimes it seems like there is nothing at all. It mainly is a problem in the evening, i've noticed I've been having lots of gas and intestinal cramps. Could there be some relationship? My HMO didn't seem to think it was any concern. but really its a bother! I've been tested for all STDs and UTI and they all came back negative. What do I do?",

    "question": "I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with HPV because I had warts on my rectum (i'm a male). I was prescribed ALDARA cream for it. I left the cream on for too long the first week and it felt reallly irritated. I learned later your supposed to wash it off in the morning. After the first week I developed another problem and I wonder if it has something to do with ALDARA. I feel like I have to pee ALL the time. after I go to the bathroom I feel like I have to run back in! It makes my job horrible. Could the cream have just caused swelling that's not letting everything work properly? I've never felt like this before and the only thing I can think is that its must be cause by the cream since it happened after I started using it. Please help, I don't have health insurance and can't afford to run back to the doctor after this last thing. thanks",
