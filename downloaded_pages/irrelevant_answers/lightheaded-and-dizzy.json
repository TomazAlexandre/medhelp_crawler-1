            "answer": "Has anyone checked your blood sugar to make sure you don't have diabetes? It could be low blood sugar.... maybe start keeping track of what you eat and what time it is when you eat and then marking down what time it is when these episodes happen.... I would talk to the doctor and have them do a REAL blood sugar test. I cap REAL bc they need to have you fast and check your blood sugar and then recheck it(I believe) but if they don't have you fast first then the test isn't really going to find anything. and I think that they test it a couple times... anyway, that's what I would suggest.also....have they checked out if it might be hormonal? jw....",

I did use to have low Bp but now that's normal but it didn't cure the dizziness and faint feelings. It almost feels as if someone hits me in the back of my head before a spill starts.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you have headaches and hot flashes and lightheadedness with a feeling of passing out, you could be having either polycystic ovarian disease or GERD with or without H pylori infection. These are the two conditions to be ruled out first. Other conditions to be strongly ruled out in your case could be cervical spinal nerve compression, Meniere\u2019s disease of the ear, wax in the ear, infection of the middle or inner ear, benign positional vertigo and benign intracranial hypertension. Hence it is important to consult an ENT specialist and a neurologist too. At times back and neck problems may persist for years before they really start giving trouble. Chances of TMJ too should be looked into. Other causes are anemia, hypoglycemia or low sugar and some endocrine problems, such as an underactive thyroid (called hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (called hyperthyroidism), adrenal insufficiency (called Addison's disease),\u00a0\u00a0and in some cases, diabetes, may lead to hypotension and hence lightheadedness and an off balance feeling. It can also be an anxiety and panic attack. It is really difficult to comment on the net. I suggest you consult your PCP to run the basic investigations and get an insight into what could be the cause. Depending on clinical examination and tests, your PCP can refer you to the appropriate specialist. Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "OK I have been dealing with this problem for about 7 or 8 years, I will be completely fine one minuet and the next I have this sudden feeling of someone hitting me in the back of my head, the room starts to spin my heart starts to race and I lose my balence, but just as fast as it comes it leaves. I have been to many diffrent doctors and they havent found anything. After completing holster test (the heart monitors) and a tilt table test the results have proven nothing. The doctors seem to believe the heart rate excelrating is because I am a growing teenagers and is quite common. I am olny 19 and I cant help but feel like there is something else at work here, but I have no idea on what it may be. If anyone has any clus i would gladly appreciate it.",
