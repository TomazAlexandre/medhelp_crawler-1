            "answer": "Did you doctors give you an idea of what to do? Sometimes wearing a patch over the eye (over glasses) can give it a rest as well as just tears in a bottle to help with dryness - but they may want to do more if you are more uncomfortable. Have you conveyed to them how bothersome your eye is? Have you seen an eye doctor (an MD, not just a person who does glasses) or even a neuro-opthomologist? Bring a copy of your scan or report with you.I really would report this as if it gets worse, well, eyes don't do well with damage.",

            "answer": "I am not saying to do it forever... just so you can function. My mom keeps having strokes and gets double vision (uncontrolled diabetes, refuses to stop smoking and drinking), so she wears a patch so she can walk and function better.The root cause sounds like it is the location of the cyst as that is near the optic nerve I think. The third ventricle is beneath the corpus callosum and surrounded by the thalamus. I think your cyst is in the Foramen of Monro or Interventricular foramina based on what you said.Until the cyst changes size - by surgery or something - it is not going to change. You need to address that with a neurosurgeon.",

    "question": "I am 33. This past sunday, I awoke with a blurred vision out of my right eye. After a ct scan I wasalso initially diagnosed with colloid cyst, just as you on 3rd ventriclurla monroe. I am wondering what to do as the blurriness and discomfort on the right eye has not gone away (5 days later)",
