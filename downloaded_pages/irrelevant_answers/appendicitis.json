            "answer": "Dear GerryFromDerry,While I am a volunteer for JDRF, I am not a doctor and am not qualified to give you medical advise. I can give you my own personal experience.I would like to know when you were diagnosed with diabetes. From what you have said regarding your symptom's, you may want to see a GI doctor. There is a complication called gastroparesis. My son, who is 27, was diagnosed with this 3 years ago. I am not suggesting that you have it, but if you are not getting answer's, it might be worth checking out. Normally, the muscles in the wall of the stomach contract in a coordinated way to move food through the stomach into the small intestine. The autonomic nervous system controls this muscular action. Diabetes can damage the autonomic nerves. This is called diabetic autonomic neuropathy. As a result, the stomach loses it's coordinated muscular activity and doesn't empty the stomach properly.Symptoms can include pain, nausea, vomiting, heartburn and an early fullness when eating. My son's doctor, who is a endo and also is very involved with research, has also found that some people with gastroparesis have a problem drinking alcohol. He described it as almost an allergy. This does not have anything to do with being an alcoholic. My son rarely drank, but when he did he would sometimes end up in the hospital. He no longer drinks at all and it has helped. There are medications that can also help.Please let us know how you are doing in any case. As I said before, this may not be the case with you. Your pain and nausea could be symptoms of many different problems. It could even be an ulcer, but in any case, I would recommend that you seek help from a doctor who specialize's in stomach problems. I wish you the best of luck. Keep in touch.dm",

            "answer": "Go the doctor right away, tho' I'm guessing that by the time you read this, you may already have HAD to go.What you describe could be a number of things, including pancreatitis, appendicitis, diverticulitis, ... or something else altogether.This set of symptoms doesn't seem to be the type one can afford to ignore.Pls see a doc/urgent care right away.\u00a0\u00a0Hope you'll write again to let us know how you're doing.",

    "question": "My question is. I get pains in the upper left quadrant of my abdomen. I have contact nausea and slight unsteadiness. I have had a CT of my head and a ECG of my heart to rule out anything extremely serious.At times the nausea gets soo bad i feel like i may faint.Also the pains in my abdomen seem to get worse when i eat or after a night out drinking. Then the pain gets very sharp and spreads to the left side and lower left of the back, i get hit by a sudden feeling of weakness and have to lie down.What are the possible causes of this pain, and could it be linked to my other symptoms?p.s.\u00a0\u00a0i am fully aware that this is not a diagnosis, it is just to know wether or not i should get this checked by my GP.p.p.s i am male, 20, 5ft 10\", and weigh 10 1/2 stone and otherwise healthy.",
