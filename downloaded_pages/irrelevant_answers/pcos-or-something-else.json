            "answer": "You may have PCOS given your history of irregular cycles and increased facial hair. The following is some general information on PCOS from my clinic website:PCOS can affect 5% of all women and common symptoms include irregular menstrual cycles, increased growth of hair on the body, loss of hair on the head, acne, and weight gain. Based on the 2003 ESHRE/ASRM sponsored Consensus Workshop Group, PCOS is diagnosed in women who meet two of the three following criteria: ovarian dysfunction (not ovulating regularly), hyperandrogenism (increased male type hormones on lab testing or clinically increased hair growth), or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (ovaries which show multiple small cysts on ultrasound). PCOS is a common cause of infertility and puts women at an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. There is also increased risk of insulin resistance, hypertension, and abnormalities of cholesterol and triglycerides in women with PCOS. Due to these risks, we advise our patients with PCOS to have the complete metabolic assessment with complete lipid panel testing and a two hour glucose tolerance test.I suggest that you see a doctor to see if you have PCOS and to find out why you are having pelvic pain. You can see a gynecologist or a Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility specialist who specializes in female hormnone disorders. I wish you wellness.",

NO i havent she thougth thats what i may have ran alot of test and nothing really abnormal (cant really remember its been awhile)and referred me to an ob/gyn. she just did a regular check and pap (neg results never heard anything back) no ultra or vaginal sound to be sure. put on metformin and yaz BC took for about 5/6 months and stopped the metformin made me sick and quit taking the yaz altogether no sexual drive at all (whole other issue ) and well since i quit taking them about 7/8 months now and still no period. i do feel lots of pressure on the right and left sides of my pelvic area annoying pains and pressures nothing where i have to go into fetal position for just pressures ( pretty much constant) and lower back pain every know and then. something too a noticed is my bowl movements they jump from normal to soft to where i need to go but cant? diabetes runs in my family really bad, my mother and sister cervical cancer . could there be something else wrong with me or is it the \"unsure do i really have PCOS\" ?",
