            "answer": "Good info for anyone that has served and is in need of disability!How about those of us that didn't? Is our MS service related too? Just kidding I have to laugh when I find out things like this.I am thrilled for anyone that this may help because they need it and if they did serve than they deserve it. I just don't get how they can call it service related when there are so many of us with MS that never had the honor of serving.Oh well who cares why they say it is, for those who qualify GO GET IT!- thanks for sharingErin :)",

            "answer": "Gulf war syndrome, spending time at places like Perris Island, getting 18 vaccines in one day, sometimes twice in a a few years, has led two lawsuits from MS and focal neuropathy patients who were diagnoed soon after these events. It raised eyebrows for me when I discovered that the cmpany that makes several of the disease modifying drugs are the same companies that made the vaccines the Army used during the years in question. They also stopped using them because of the numbers of affected troops.\u00a0\u00a0They have hundreds of MS centers for excellence at VA hospitals, none for diabetes or heart disease, etc. which are far more common coincidence? No",

    "question": "Hi All,It has been suggested to me a couple of times that M.S. is service related. I never really paid any attention to it as I know that the cause for M.S. is unkown, and generally service-connected disabilities have a known or suspected cause.Well, I found out today through my regional V.A. office that M.S. is considered service related when a diagnosis is made within 7 years of discharge and there is at least 10% disability.Hopefully this will help somebody...Disability check, here I come!Here's a post on another site that I found via google for anybody who is interested. This is where I started my research, and like I said, ended at my regional VA office. http://www.chemtrailcentral.com/ubb/Forum3/HTML/000043.htmlKenny",
