            "answer": "Hello there,You said your cat has strange symptoms similar to diabetes. What arethese strange symptoms? If you suspect your cat has diabetes, I wouldsuggest you take her to your vet asap. Take that money you were goingto use to purchase the home tests your listed and take your kitty forprofessional medical advice. Our cat was diagnosed with diabetes througha blood test. The blood test is not expensive atleast not here in Canada.Diabetes is nothing to fool around with. If your kitty has diabetes she needsproper medical attention, probably special food which will need to be determined by your vet and the amount of food has to be determined too.Good luck. Eve",

            "answer": "has she been drinking alot more than usual? that is more a sign of diabetes than eating more, and usually its a worry when they eat lots but start dropping weight rather than gaining....go ahead and try the strips, IMO she really doesn't sound like there is much to be concerned about....UNLESS she is drinking alot, constantly hungry and NOT gaining weight..than see a Vet..of course if you are still concerned be sure to get proper Vet advice and testing...",
