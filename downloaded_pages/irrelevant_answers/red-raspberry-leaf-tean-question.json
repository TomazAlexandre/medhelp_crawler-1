            "answer": "This all depends,if u ever had a previous c-section dont take it. It can give u fake contractions which wod cause ur scar to rupture. Otherwise start taking one cup a day from around 32wks, by 37wks drink 3-4cups. U will feel really healthy. It tones ur uterus and makes the contractions stronger but better for ur uterus.is known to speed up labour too. Also makes ur uterus go back to proper size very quickly afterwards. As for the bleeding u are meant to bleed less than normal.not sure if it stops it completely.",

            "answer": "I looked on a website. I hope i remember this in my 3rd ttrimester.If you\u2019re anything like me and you\u2019ve never made tea before the whole thing can seem a bit confusing. So I will post directions for those who were in my shoes. If you bought the tea in loose leaf form (meaning you have a bag full of herbs sitting in front of you) you can either make it one cup at a time or make it in a larger quantity. If you\u2019re going to drink it hot stick to one cup at a time. If you\u2019re like me and prefer it cold it is easiest to make it in a batch. You can sweeten it with honey or sugar if you like or some prefer to squeeze in a fresh lemon or an orange.If you\u2019ll be making one cup batches you will need something to put the tea in. A reusable tea bag works well or you can buy a little tea infuser (they only run a few dollars and you can buy them in kitchen departments or stores).",

It does not, however, counter the pain of pelvic dilation.-Assists in the production of plentiful breast milk-Can help make labor faster: RRL works to encourage the uterus to let go and function without tension. It doesn\u2019t strengthen contractions but it does allow the uterus to work more efficiently-Studies show that women taking RRL have a reduced incidence of artificial rupture of membranes, forceps delivery or cesareanOther Uses for Red Raspberry Leaf:-Treating the common cold or flu (Treat with a RRL fast. Drink only the tea while your symptoms persist. Once your symptoms are gone return to eating fresh fruits/vegetables.)-Treating sore throat-Treating diarrhea (Drink 6 cups a day to treat diarrhea)-Regulating a menstrual period and decreasing heavy periods (Drink 2-3 cups per day. After 2-3 months you should obtain a regular cycle.)-Treating Acne: It can act as an astringent on irritated skin by tightening the top layers of skin which effectively reduces secretions, relieves irritation and improves tissue firmness.-Can be used as a mouth wash to soothe mouth and throat irritations-Can lower blood sugar in those suffering with diabetes (Those with diabetes must take care not to take RRL in too high of doses or it could actually cause their blood sugar to drop too low).",
