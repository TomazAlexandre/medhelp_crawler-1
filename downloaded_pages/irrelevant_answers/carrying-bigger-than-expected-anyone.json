You could just have a longer baby...also all pregnancies are different and that may be normal for you!",

Eventually she just told me that some women have a more nourishing placenta. I think that was her nice way of telling me to quit eating so much, lol. Anyway, my water broke at 35 weeks, and my son was 6 lb 3 oz.",

            "answer": "I've been measuring 2 weeks ahead as well. I'm 38 weeks and the baby is already measuring 40 weeks so I'm afraid when I get to 40 weeks the baby will be huge.\u00a0\u00a0I was hoping that my due date was wrong because it was changed in the beginning pushed back by 27 days so I was hoping that maybe they just pushed it back too far...but the ultrasound tech last week said probly not she said in the third trimester it just means the baby is big not that you are farther along than you thought....but you never know because even the early ultrasounds can be a week or two off. My Dr is keeping an eye on the baby's size I have my weekly apt tomorrow and he might send me for another ultrasound to check the weight again. He said he might induce me if needed. I'm just hoping the baby comes by himself a little early. The Dr even said that maybe I will go a week early. He's not huge yet but I'm afraid if he stays in too much longer he will be. the ultrasound said 7 lbs 6 ounces last week. Ultrasiunds can be innacurate though a pound over or under. So I'm hoping maybe he is smaller I'm praying he's not bigger. The Dr felt the baby by pressing on my stomach and said the baby doesn't feel that big even though my stomach is huge.I've had people ask me if I'm having twins....I'm still afraid one is hiding. The Dr said he could feel the entire baby the head and butt and he didn't even feel like 7.6 lbs so I don't knoe.... I think i just carry big. Im small and i didnt even gain that much weight. Im a picky eater and dont eat that much...so i dont know how the baby got big. So we will see.",
