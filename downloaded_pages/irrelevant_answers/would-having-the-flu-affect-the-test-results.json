    "question": "I got the call from my doctor today saying I have gestational diabetes & anemia. I've had anemia off & on all my life but the diabetes is new for me. The day before my test I had flu like symptoms, I threw up all morning, not normal for me with this pregnancy, I didn't eat anything but a small dinner that day. The next morning I had a half cup of coffee with international delight sweeter & an apple then did my blood test. I'm just confused because I don't indulge in sweets or junk food, I eat small meals/snacks all day, dinner is my biggest meal. I have no symptoms of gestational diabetes, and have 2 kids already, its never been an issue with either of them when I was pregnant! Could the test be wrong?",
