            "answer": "Hi,That is a tough one to answer without knowing the daily pattern, your wife's medications(all of them), and her eating/activity patterns. many things affect glucose patterns during the day so pinpointing it without the complete picture is impossible. I suggest your wife speak with her endocrinologist or seke out an opinion of a diabetes specialist who can go through everyting in detail and make changes to her regimen.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and take care,Anita Ramsetty, MD",

            "answer": "Hi,A few examples of what could make your wife's blood sugars fluctuate:\u00a0\u00a0activity patterns such as vigorous exercise, her diet(especially carbohydrates eaten during a meal),the timing and dose of her medications(not just diabetes pills, but others as well) and if she has other medical issues such as kidney problems. Given the possible contributions from any or many factors, I cannot responsibly give you a pinpoint answer, I am afraid. I really would need a complete history and records in order to do that for your wife.Ideally what she needs is a glucose log of atleast a few days' length with glucoses checked about 3-4 times a day, and a visit to her doctor who can then review the numbers and speak with her about her activities and diet while reviewing the glucose numbers. Then the reasons for her patterns can likely be discovered and fixed. Hope this helps! Take care.Anita Ramsetty,MD",
