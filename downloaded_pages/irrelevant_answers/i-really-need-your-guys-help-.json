            "answer": "It's been more than long enough to get yourself a type specific herpes igg blood test for hsv1 and hsv2. Why not go get one and get it over with? It could've just been some type of localized infection going on and it could've been a uti but then it could've been a heck of a lot of other things too.\u00a0\u00a0Follow up with your doctor and make sure that you don't have a low level yeast infection too that is at its worst during your period too.grace",

            "answer": "See, the thing is, the sore started out as just a bump underneath the skin. It didnt even hurt until the sore thingy appeared. Im not even sure it was a sore, just this little indented raw patch. It wasnt even red, neither was the sore. It was really dry, no fluid and like I said, went away with antibacterial stuff. Also, the UTI happened about two weeks after the sore was gone, none of these things happen at the same time.Ive also noticed that when Im worried about herpes, thats when I have the symptoms. When Im not worried, or Im distracted, i dont have a problem. Before I knew the symptoms of herpes, I never ever had a problem. During the time I had the UTI, I had a lot of white watery discharge, if that makes any sense.From what i understand, this seems like more of a yeast infection than a herpes infection. I would bet its more that if its even anything than herpes, given everything. When this little sore appeared I hadnt been sexually active for more than 6 months. Before I thought I had anything I was fine. I am severe hypochondriac. I've thought I had HIV, diabetes, hypothyroid something, hepatitus, gonnerhea...the list goes on. Thats what really makes me second guess myself is that I KNOW I obsess over things like this.The burning when I pee seems to happen for about a day before my period. Only lasts until I drink some water, than goes away.Where can I find some good info on yeast infections and such?Thanks so much.",

    "question": "Thanks in advance for helping me out.Here's the deal. In January I got this this little sore area. It cleared up with some neosporin and there was green stuff on the bandage I covered it with. Was only there for 3 days until I put the neosporin on. Once I applied the neosporin, it stopped hurting and was gone within 48 hours. No blistering, scabbing, nothing. Had what i assumed to be was a UTI which cleared up with cipro 500 1x a day for 5 daysSince that time, I have been worried to death about herpes. I get random burning when I pee and elsewhere, tingling and itching to the point where I actually get red and irritated.Most of this seems to happen around my period, mostly before and after. Until I thought I had a herpes, none of this was going on. I have had no recurrences since that initial sore. It was the only one I've ever had. Whats more is Ive noticed that until I read these herpes symptoms, I didnt have them.So, my question is this: Do you think this is a legitimate case of herpes or just anxiety?Thanks again.",
