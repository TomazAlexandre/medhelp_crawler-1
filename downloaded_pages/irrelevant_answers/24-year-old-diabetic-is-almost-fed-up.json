            "answer": "Thought I would add a link that lists organizations that claim to provide insulin pump supplies free of charge if a person provides financial proof that they are eligible.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t have experience in obtaining free insulin pump supplies from any organization, so you may want to email these organizations.\u00a0\u00a0The link is:http://www.isletsofhope.com/diabetes/assistance-programs/free-insulin-pump-supplies-1.htmlThe organizations listed at this link that appear to be the most helpful are:http://www.charlesray.g12.com/The Charles Ray III Diabetes Association (their email address is ***@****);\u00a0\u00a0Since I noticed you live in North Carolina, you may want to check with this association since their website says they are located in Apex, North Carolina.\u00a0\u00a0One drawback though is their $15 application fee.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to email them and explain your situation, and maybe they could tell you whether you would be eligible for their program without having to pay an application fee.http://www.insulin-pumpers.org/(their email address is HELP@insulin-pumpers.org); I wasn\u2019t able to find any specific information on the website about financial assistance for pump supplies, but the link said they \u201coffer financial assistance through their Insulin Pumpers Foundation program.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0You may want to email them and explain your situation, and maybe they can direct you to the appropriate help.http://www.ipump.org/(their email address is program-***@****); Even though their website says they are currently only assisting uninsured children under the age of 21, they say they assist adults when \u201cfunding permits.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to email them and see if they are currently assisting adults.http://www.isletsofhope.com/diabetes/assistance-programs/free-insulin-pump-supplies-1.html also lists and describes several other links that may be helpful.If you haven\u2019t already, you may also want to consider applying for disability through your local Social Security office since you seem to have a lot of health problems.\u00a0\u00a0If Social Security found you to be disabled, you would be able to get free health insurance.Hope this helps & God Bless You!",

            "answer": "My son lost his Medicaid coverage a couple months ago when he turned 21. We were both frantically trying to figure out how we could afford to keep him on his Animas pump since he pretty much refused to go back to syringes. I tried all those links that are listed above in the other responses, and trust me, none of them can offer any assistance for those over 18. And the ones that offer \"discounts\" on prescriptions are worthless for type 1's. None of those websites offer test strips or pump supplies such as cartridges and infusion sets.My son is a full time college student and currently looking for part-time work. As a single mom, I can't afford to purchase health insurance for either of us. Here's what we came up with as a temporary way to keep him on his pump, as well as get test strips and other supplies. He no longer sees an endo, but now sees an Internal Medicine Resident (doctor in training) near one of our local hospitals and pays a very small fee on a sliding scale. He is currently waiting for our County health plan to start accepting new clients, which usually happens only once a year. If he gets in, he will get basic medical care (which includes doctor visits and prescriptions, including test strips) for about $10 per month. The county plan will not cover pump supplies, but the Animas (insulin pump company) rep in our area is supplying him with \"free samples\" of infusion sets for as long as he needs them, although he can't request a certain length of tubing, but that's OK cuz beggars can't be choosers! Animas will also give him a discount for cash payment when he needs to order more cartridges, and those are much cheaper than the infusion sets (approx $30 a box) which lasts him at least a month. I've been buying his test stips on eBay (yes it's safe....always ask for the expiration dates) and pay way less than pharmacies, usually around 30 cents per strip. And Novo Nordisk (Novolog) will provide you with free insulin, although they must send it directly to a physician's office.Are you currently wearing a pump? Are you seeing a doctor? It sounds like you need some major adjustmemts to your daily insulin doses. Please ask your doctor to help you with this. There is no reason to have an A1C that high. It sounds like you are not getting enough insulin, both short and long acting. If you cannot get help from your doctor with figuring out the correct insulin amount, there are books you can buy (or perhaps find at your local library) to help you figure this out on your own. Do not delay in changing your insulin doses! You are hurting your body, and the longer you go with high A1c's, the more likely you will develop major diabetes related complications (heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, retinopothy, neuropathy) as you get older. Please let us know how you are doing.",

    "question": "I am a diabetic who has been diabetoc for almost 17 years! When I was 19 I lost my health insurance so therefore I had to come off of my insulin pump because the supplies are so expensive. I also had to stop seeing my endocronologist because of this reason. I was recently diagnosed with Panic with anxiety, ADHD, and major depressive disorder and they said it is linked alot to my diabetes. I cannot control my diabetes as much as I try. I dont excercise on a regular basis but I run 2 times a week and walk alot. I can never be still. I test my BS 5 times aday and take anywhere from 7 to 9 shots aday to control my diabetes. I just had my hemoglobin A1c done and it is 14! And I am trying so hard! Im not lazy I do try.\u00a0\u00a0I cook good meals, I eat right (with the occasional snack) I excercise, Im always on the go! This is really stressing me out! I had to sell my car to afford to get back on the pump to get supplies because the control was soooooo far gone! My doctor thinks I am nuts becasue she cant understand why my BS runs so high! I dont drink sodas (diet or reg) and I watch what I eat! I am on a sliding scale of 15:1 (carbs to humalog) 12 U of Lantus a day, and herbal vitamins to control other health problems such as Iron deficiency and folic acid along with celexa for my anxiety. I sit around and try to think of ways to help this problem but Im all out of answers. I cant sleep because I have a history of passing out in my sleep and Im scared I will pass out and wont wake up so Im up every 2 hours testing at night sometimes. I check before I go to bed but that still doesnt help. In the 17 years that I have been diabetic I have always struggled with my BS going low in my sleep and me waking up in the 30's or 40's! Doctors have moved insulin around put me on continuous gluclose monitoring system and NOTHING WORKS! I cant afford my medicines so I have to \"BUDGET\" the amount used which I know is alot of the problem but I cant afford to go to the drs. I have one bill I pay and that s internet to stay in contact with my family so its not like my money is being wasted elsewhere. I just dont know how long I can take this. Its so fusterating that alot of other people can get health insurance but I cant!? and I need it?! My mom and dad are both disabled so they dont have the money to help out. My boyfriend is a veteran and helps out as much as he can but his money can only go so far.If anyone has any suggestions that might help me please let me know. I dont know what else to do.Thanks for reading my rant. It feels kinda good to get it all out in the open.",
