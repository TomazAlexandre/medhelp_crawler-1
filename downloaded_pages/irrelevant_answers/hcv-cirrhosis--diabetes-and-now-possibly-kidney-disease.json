            "answer": "What is the reference interval on the labs for your kidney values? Values like that could be related to medication, dehydration or not going to the bathroom (urinating) enough. This is entirely without other info or predictors related to your health. In general a wait and see perspective is not unusual. The thing is since you are cirrhotic and have diabetes I strongly encourage you to transfer your care to a Hepatologist who is trained to deal with coexisting medical conditions. That truly is the best person to determine how to proceed.I saw this yesterday and wondered. I wish I could offer more. You might want to repost in the Cirrhosis of the Liver Forumhttp://www.medhelp.org/forums/Cirrhosis-of-the-Liver/show/1390Meanwhile it would help to know when you had your fibrosis assessed and by what means and what genotype of HCV you have and whether you have treated in the past. It might be time to consider your treatment options if you have not already.",

    "question": "So I went to my PCP to follow up on my A1C for my diabetes, going through my results my GFR was 56 and Creatinine was at 1.53 my Dr. wants to follow up next month. I decided to go through my previous blood work for the last year and found that my GFR has been declining in the last year, while my Creatinine level was moving up. I actually had recently went to see the Dr. treating my HCV and those results also showed the same results in GFR and Creatinine level approx. 8 days. My question, is this a normal progression considering my other ailments. Should i try to see a different doc or wait til next month?",
