            "answer": "1) unlikely - the varicella zoster virus usually sticks to one or a few 'dermatomes' - band like areas of skin that are supplied by a singel sensory nerve. Disseminted zoster can occur, usually in patients with a compromised immune system like AIDS.2) For sensory nerve pain, some first line agents are Neurontin and now Lyrica. Some antidepressants also treat nerve pain but the SSRI group (like Zoloft) are not usually used for this indication3) having one autoimmune disease makes it MORE likely to have other autoimmune disease, we do not know why, it is within are genetic makeup/susceptibility tothese types of diseases. MS and most neuropathies are not classified as autoimmune diseases with increased risk in patients with other autoimmune disease.4) this is acceptable, follow up tests can reveal changes or progression and the clinical course might give clues or prompt further testing. Other tests that may be beneficial might be an examination of the spinal fluid, and a HIV/Syphilis test.5) the clinical picture you present is non-specific, I cannot give you a definite clinical diagnosis, the more common causes for sensory neuropathies are diabetes, B12, HIV, amyloid, or paraneoplastic neuropathy.Good luck",

            "answer": "In the last few days I have experienced the twitching more consistantly when at rest. I feel it in both calves, and both hands in the fingers and also my jaw at times.\u00a0\u00a0I made a neurologist appointment for dec 20. Having read many more of the posts this week, I feel that I am experiencing an autoimmune peripheral neuropathy (based on the PA I have).\u00a0\u00a0It seems that a steroid is the drug of choice in that instance.\u00a0\u00a0I'll see what the dr. says.\u00a0\u00a0Can I wait until Dec 20 (9 days) or do I risk any nerve damage?\u00a0\u00a0Still no pain or weakness. The Zoloft is making me less anxious, but it has given me some insomnia which doesn't help me.",
