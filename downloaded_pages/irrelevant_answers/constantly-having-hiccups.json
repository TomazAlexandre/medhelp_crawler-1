            "answer": "I hope your husband will look into ALTERNATIVE health methods, under good medical supervision, so he can hopefully SAFELY get off (or decrease) his many medications.Try having him press on an acupressure point, just above his upper lip, in the middle, between the bottom of his nose, and the top edge of his upper lip (in the center).This acupuncture point has worked for my husband and myself, to stop \"regular\" hiccups.Also, look at some GASTRIC REFLUX TIPS (without acid blockers) that I will cut & paste, below. I hope your husband feels better, and gets his health back, as soon as possible.Some GASTRIC REFLUX TIPS (without acid blockers):GER=Gastro-Esophageal Reflux. (Gastro=stomach. Esophagus=food tube.)LPR= Laryngeal-Pharyngeal Reflux. (Larynx=voice box, containing the 2 vocal cords. Pharynx=throat, above the larynx. The larynx is above the trachea/windpipe.)Reflux=acidic or alkaline stomach material that backs up into the esophagus (food tube), causing any of these problems: VCD/Vocal Cord Dysfunction/Laryngospasm attacks, cough, voice problems, asthma, globus (feeling of lump in throat), constant need to clear throat, worsening of sinus condition, sore throat, pre-cancerous conditions of throat &/or esophagus, etc.SOME GER/LPR CONTROL THINGS WE DO, that we learned from the excellent book: STOMACH AILMENTS AND DIGESTIVE DISTURBANCES, by Michael T. Murray, N.D. See page 9, References, in my website: http://cantbreathesuspectvcd.com\u00a0\u00a0 and, also see GER/LPR info on page 5, and on LINKS page.PLEASE READ THIS GREAT BOOK. It may possibly be bought on-line, from Michael T. Murray",
