            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. of increased T2/Flair signals indicate small vessel ischemic disease or changes of brain blood vessels. These changes are seen in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or Wilson's Disease, migraine headaches, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. You may not be suffering from small vessel disease, but yes, some small vessels of brain have got involved due to any of the above causes. So the cause has to be found out and treated. Numbness of leg can also be due to peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes or thyroid disorders. It can also be a pinched nerve in lower back.\u00a0\u00a0Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.
