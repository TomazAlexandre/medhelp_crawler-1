            "answer": "Hello Sumeet,One thing that can cause diabetics to lose weight is if our blood sugar is not well controlled.\u00a0\u00a0If our blood sugar is high, that means that the sugars from the foods we eat is, essentially, \"stuck\" floating around in our blood stream.\u00a0\u00a0The results of that is at least 2-fold:\u00a0\u00a0first, the excess sugar is causing damage to our organs (kidneys, nervous system, eyes, vascular system) and second, the cells that NEED the sugar for fuel -- well, those cells simply are starving.\u00a0\u00a0It's ironic -- all that sugar floating in the blood stream and little of it available to the cells.So if we're experiencing high blood sugar all the time -- say 200 or more for days, weeks, months at a time, then we're slowing wasting away.\u00a0\u00a0To begin to maintain a healthy weight requires hard work to gradually bring blood sugar into normal ranges most of the time.Do you have access to an endocrinologist? I recommend you work with this type of physician soon, because they specialize in the treatment of diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0Many of us find that Certified Diabetes Educators are a big help in working out daily details of managing this disease.Here are some good websites with information on kidney function tests.\u00a0\u00a0My endocrinologist orders some of these tests once a year for me.This site has info on different tests:http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/kidneytests/This site has info on kidneys \"in general\" and may help you understand the connection between diabetes management and kidney health:http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/yourkidneys/Good luck, Sumeet.\u00a0\u00a0Do check back and remember that none of us here is a physician, so work closely with your physician to gain good control over your diabetes.",

            "answer": "Sumeet,Urine Microalbumin:Microalbuminuria (persistent albumin in the urine) has been shown to be the earliest stage of diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease) in Type 1 diabetes and a marker for development of nephropathy in Type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 Microalbuminuria is also a marker of increased cardiovascular disease.An annual test for the presence of microalbumin should be done.Talk to your diabetes educator/doctor about gaining weight.\u00a0\u00a0You will probably need to eat a certain amount of calories each day and make sure your blood sugars are in the normal range.\u00a0\u00a0Your weight loss may have been pre-diagnosis and once your blood sugars are in the normal range, you will be able to gain weight again.",
