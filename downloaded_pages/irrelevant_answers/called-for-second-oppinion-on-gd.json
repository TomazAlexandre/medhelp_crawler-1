Plus it made me feel really sick after.Was your Marcus a bit bigger also?\u00a0\u00a0I thought they usually follow suit.Anyhow, glad your ok. :-)",

            "answer": "Marcus was a big 6 lbs 11 oz, and only 2 days early.... never measured big, gained more weight (55 lbs), never had sugar in urine, never even test for GDThis one, measuring big, sugar in urine 3 times, tested and passed GD screening, spotting bright red blood all the time...these boys so far have not been the same except no morning sickness...I pray for a little 6 lbs 11 oz, I will even take 7 lbs, but pray for me if it is bigger. I will cry, I had stitches with Marcus and they hurt really bad. He never froze me and I had no drugs. Plus peeing burned like a #$%#, I can't explain the stinging of that.Friday is the ultrasound so we will see how he is doing size and health wise. I will be off next week so no internet unless I go to mom's house. And the week of March 26 I'm leaving work early to spend time with marcus. I will miss all you guys.",

And can they really feel this top of the uterus exactly?I was 2 weeks ahead on Feb 12, and on March 5 I was 3 weeks. My mother in law says it depends on where the full moon is. I'm due May 8 and the full moon in May 2, unless we use the April 2 moon. lol\u00a0\u00a0 My mom keeps saying I'm going April 1. Wouldn't that be a joke...TTYL",

            "answer": "I've been searching all over for alternative methods of testing for GD, b/c you've got me so curious.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing I could find is from some lay midwives who substitute jelly beans or a PURE CARBOHYDRATE breakfast for the oral glucola.As long as your sandwiches you ate didn't have protein in them, the test was probably ok. Substandard, but probably ok. Protein alters the metabolism of the glucose, and thus you might not see the abnormal rise you would get with the pure carb of the drink, if you had GD.Whew!\u00a0\u00a0Theres a lot out there on GD testing, but very little on using food for testing. Interesting subject, thanks for bringing it up!",

    "question": "Hello Ladies,\u00a0\u00a0I posted yesterday about my concern with sugar in my urine.\u00a0\u00a0All of you suggested the drink test, and didn't like the way my doctor did the eat lunch and then test....Well I thought about it a lot and decided to check around. I called our local Diabetes Association and they forwarded me to the General Hospital. Apparently we have Diabetes Educators and nutritionist there. I talked with them on the phone since they know everything about Diabetes. They are aware of some doctors doing food test instead of drink tests. She said leaking sugar is not as bad as sugar in the blood. I told her what I ate, 2 sandwiches & 2 bananas (knowing bananas are high and eat them all the time) According to the her, I ate more sugar in my food than what is in the drink. The sandwichs and bananas are equal, and possibly more concentrated than the drink.\u00a0\u00a0She said that some women only get G.D. in the last three weeks of pregnancy and that they most likely will do another blood test if they find sugar again in the urine next time.I just wanted you all to know that his way may not be as crazy as we all thought and that the National Association for Diabetes agrees that there are two ways to do it. And that I should just keep an eye on it. Sugar in blood is bad, sugar in urine can be okay. Something about pregnancy reduces the amount of sugar you process and some bodies excrete it in blood others just pass it in urine.... like me.Thanks for listening to me complain.\u00a0\u00a0I have my u/s on Friday at 3:40pm to see if everything is okay.",
