            "answer": "If you're in the US it might not be an option. I'm a type 2 diabetic so I for sure know the seriousness of this. The thing with an A1C test is that it tests you for the past three months, respectively. Sometimes it may be a new problem and not something that has happened the whole time you've been pregnant so it's not as accurate as the glucose test, or the time being. I know you are worried about putting that much sugar in your body but you have to think of it as a preventative for long term effects on your baby. If you have GD it can cause your baby's heart to thicken which can cause baby to grow at faster rate (like steroids) which can cause heart problems and organ problems, not to mention all sorts of other things. You can inquire to your doctor about a different test but you definitely need to have something equivalent done. I've been dealing with this my whole pregnancy and it isn't a walk in the park so the sooner you know the better it is for you and baby",

    "question": "MY glucola test is in a few weeks. As you may know, the protocol is to down a 50 gram glucose drink and then draw bloodwork. I'm very holistic and picky when coming to what I put in my body and instictively, it doesn't seem right to drown my body with 50 grams of glucose. I know many of you will not agree with me and say I should sacrifice for my baby and I know that. But are there any alternatives to this test? Such as just taking blood to test A1C?",
