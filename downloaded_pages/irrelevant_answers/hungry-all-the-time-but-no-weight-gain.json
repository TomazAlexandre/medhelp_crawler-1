    "question": "My 41/2 year old son has been an type 1 diabetic since age 2 , he has always been smaller than children his age. When we discovered he was diabetic we hoped that would help, and it did some what. But now for the last 1 year or so my son is extremely hungry all the time. He eats every hour or sooner so times. There is no distracting him or telling him no he still insisted he is starving. Doctors have tested him for celiac's disease and other common absorption problem.. nothing. He will be 5 in a few months and is the same size as my 2 year old, people believe that they are twins, if that gives you an idea. Doctors said it could be habit, but he eats everything you give him and doesn't gain weight, so i'm not convinced. Any suggestions or ideas of what is causing this please advise.",
