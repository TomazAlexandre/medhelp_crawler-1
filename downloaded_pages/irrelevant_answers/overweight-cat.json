            "answer": "I took my cat to the vet for her regular shots and held her on the counter so she was standing on her hind feet and showed the doctor her profile and asked if her Santa-Claus-like tummy was possibly from having worms.\u00a0\u00a0He stood in profile and stuck out his gut and patted it and said, \"About as much possibility as this being from worms.\u00a0\u00a0Naah, she's just fat.\"\u00a0\u00a0It was pretty funny because their profiles looked exactly alike.Yes, do worry about it, I put my girl on a totally different diet regime when I got her home.\u00a0\u00a0Some people stand calmly by as their cat hits 18, 19, then 20, then 21 lbs., but it really is just as bad for cats as it is for people for all the same reasons.",

            "answer": "A veterinarian friend of our says a little secret of the animal world is cats can tolerate a bit of over weight better than other animals.However, fat IS fat.Miss Teia was over 19 pounds when we first got her in June 2009 and she was a tub-a-lard (cute,in a pear shaped way, though).\u00a0\u00a0We put her on the indoor formula kibble the other girls were eating, have been mixing that for the past year or so with no-grain kibble, plus getting them all to eat more canned.Teia is now a little over 11 pounds, and very sprightly for her almost 15 years.\u00a0\u00a0Her recent blood work came back A-OK.Chessie is about 19 pounds, down from 23, and has a little trouble with complete personal grooming, so I wash her bum once a week or so.\u00a0\u00a0Her blood work was good, too.Hildie is about 17 pounds, up from 13 before her diabetes was brought under control, she'd been close to 20.\u00a0\u00a0Again, good blood work at the last check a week or so ago.",
