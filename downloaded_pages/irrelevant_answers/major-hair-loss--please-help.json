            "answer": "Hello,Since the bald spot is in a particular area, so the possibility of fungal infection of the head esp. tinea capitis needs to be evaluated.It is contagious and can spread direct contact with someone who has the condition, or if you touch contaminated items such as combs, hats, clothing, or similar surfaces. I suggest you to get it evaluated from a dermatologist. Diagnosis is by clinical examination of the scalp as well as a skin lesion biopsy with microscopic examination. My sincere advice would be to get it examined from a dermatologist. Treatment includes washing the scalp with shampoo with selenium sulfide (2.5%) or zinc pyrithione (1-2%) used 2-3 times weekly at home. Oral steroids, Griseofulvin and oral antifungals may also be required.Hope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts. Kind regards.",

            "answer": "My hair has been thinning all over for months. I assumed it was thyroid related but now I'm not too sure. My thyroid issues are changing. It's not the same as it was when I was younger. My symptoms are worse and more of them. This started itching on and off about 2 months ago. There is bumps all over. Some are small and some are like Whelps very large. My hair fell out in large amounts suddenly. A few weeks ago. Smaller spots on the top of my head and behind my ears. Even my ears are itchy. I went to the doctor yesterday. With my diabetes, thyroid and hair problems they didn't even look at it. Just said that I should see a specialist. It could take 3 weeks to get an appointment with a dermatologist. The doctor's office had put me on anti depression medicine 2 different times, until I suggested that my thyroid should be checked again. I told them yesterday that I was not taking it and I did not think I am depressed. Just \"not myself\". Thyroid is a hard thing to deal with. Thanks for the comments. I'm going to use every bit of info and take it all with me to my next appointment. Thank You!!!!",
