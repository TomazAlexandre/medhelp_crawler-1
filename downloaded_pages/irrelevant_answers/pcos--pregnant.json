I'm now in my second trimester with everything ticking along as it should. All women and pregnancies are different so probably best to speak to your ob about your situation. Best wishes to you and your little one :)",

            "answer": "I'm 30 weeks. 26 years old. Have Pcos. Was so worried about everything. So far everything has gone super smoothly. Drs are not concerned unless you start showing worrying symptoms. Keep doing everything as normal unless told otherwise. Keep track of anything worrying you and tell the dr. With Pcos there is an increased risk of misscarriage, and gestational diabetes. I had a scare at 9 weeks with a small amount of bleeding but it was all good. My results for diabetes are all normal. I have a high BMI too. So glad it's going so smooth. Just breathe deep and hope for the best.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",
