            "answer": "Its caused by the hormones that ur placenta send out to ur body and usually only lasts until the baby is born. You have to be put on a diet and check ur blood sugars to make sure they are fine otherwise they will put u on meds, so follow the diet plan they give u. And when u get further along they will just monitor the babys growth because gd causes baby to grow larger than normal so if the baby is larger then u will need a csection. I have gd and this is my second pregnancy and I am on a controlled diet but I am having a csection because I had it with my first.",
