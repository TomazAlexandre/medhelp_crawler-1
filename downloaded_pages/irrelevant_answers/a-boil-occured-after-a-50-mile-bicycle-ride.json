The bump may eventually enlarge and drain pus profusely. This may be associated with fever at one point and severe pain and tenderness over the area.On the other hand, a perianal abscess may be due to an inflammation and infection of underlying structures of the rectum and anus :\" It arises from an infection at one of the anal crypts of Morgani which leads to inflammation and abscess formation. \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perianal_abscessYou need further evaluation by a physician.

            "answer": "What kind of underwear did you wear? I run, and I've found that the special runner's underwear (with minimal seams) is much more comfortable and causes a lot less rubbing against the skin down there. I've heard MANY cyclists complain about perianal skin irritations, so you're not alone.Generally, you get what you pay for with that stuff.",
