            "answer": "I had a similar experience.\u00a0\u00a0I was referred to a rheumatlogist for aworkup regarding costochondritis and other pain syndromes.\u00a0\u00a0Hechecked my reflexes and they were all way beyond normal, they werehyperreflective.\u00a0\u00a0He (the doc,) called his nurse and P.A. in to see my relexes, and the doctor said it was due to my thyroid.,\u00a0\u00a0Wel, I havebeen taking thyroid since 1985, but the hyper reflexes told him I was on way too much medication and stop it immediately.\u00a0\u00a0I called my regular internist and saw him. He said I have what is called centra hypothyroidism, meaning my pituitary gland doesn't tell my thyrid to make thyroid, and that the test in this disease is not interpreted the same.\u00a0\u00a0Who knows, it's always something, and it seems it's left up tous to get the correct answer and not just rely on one persons opinion.I'd suggest you have a serious discussion with your doctor about thyroid disease.",

    "question": "I went to the neuro two years ago and had hyper flexes on both knees and both arms. I do have bipolar/anxiety and take zoloft, gabentin, wellbutrin, temazepam, and xanax.Well I went to the doctors Thursday to get tested for diabetes and my thyroid. All is normal.During the visit he tapped my knees and elbows and they were hyper flexes, or overexaggerated. Not enough to kick in the face but enough to worry me. This happend symmetry, in all reflexes. Not just on one side. My question is it normal for some to hyperflexes?When I seen my other doctor a year ago he did the same thing but my reflexes werent hyper.So again is this normal for some people, especially since it happend on both sides. Im 33 and a single parent.Thank you,",
