            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. You need to consult a neurologist and get a MRI of the lower spine. If you have herniated discs or pinched nerves, you will need physiotherapy, pain killers, and other lower back exercises to treat this. Also wearing lumbo-sacral corsets while at work may help. If you sit for long time, use soft and well padded seats. Air tubes can also be used for sitting. You should get up and walk once in a while.Other possibilities are low vitamin B12, or peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes, hypothyroidism or lupus etc. Please consult a doctor who can investigate this for you. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I have a pins and needles feeling that comes onto my torso and head when I am working out or during sexual activity. It starts to feel like a slight burn almost like I am going to break a sweat then it feels like I am being pricked with large needles everywhere. The pins and needles pain only started recently but gradually getting worse. I cant help but think it may be related to a lower back injury from 2010. I have seen 2 different chiropractors since my injury and although I feel 50% better, my right rear hip still hurts sharply most of the time as well as a popping sound/feeling in my lower spine that I never had prior to the injury. My job requires me to sit for nearly 8 hours at time so I can not imagine that helps tremendously.",
