            "answer": "I have to disagree with the previous poster, the comment is misleading. A fasting level of 107 mg/dl indicates prediabetes.Fasting glucose levels:Normal: 60/70 to 99 mg/dlPrediabetes: 100 to 125 mg/dlDiabetes: above 125 mg/dlYou doctor could have taken it one step further by ordering you to undergo an A1c test. An A1c provides an insight on glucose levels over the past 3 months. A fasting test tests your glucose level only at the time of your blood draw, not what it was the day, week, or months prior. But don't blame your doctor as some doctors do nothing until the onset of disease, then they take action. I think of it as being reactive not proactive.You have the chance to reverse your condition with a little proactive effort on your part. Limit your intake on foods made with white flour - white breads, crackers, pasta & starches like potatoes - as these foods quickly turn into sugar after eating. Do some sort of physical exercise daily [walking is good] to burn off excess sugar, and maintain proper weight. Of course avoid sugary foods & liquids, especially deserts. Good luck.",

            "answer": "I agree with waverider...except I feel it is the doctor's fault for not recognizing this as being prediabetic. Something's wrong when lay people pick up on something a doctor doesn't. Fortunately waverider gave you great advice, and it's now that you want to work hard to turn this around, and you can.\u00a0\u00a0This same thing happened to my husband.\u00a0\u00a0The flight surgeon would find a small amount of sugar in his urine and when he mentioned it to his PCP, he was told not to worry about it....now he has full blown Type II Diabetes, is on insulin, and others medications.\u00a0\u00a0He can no longer fly, but had he been told to take this seriously, there's a good chance he'd still be flying and a non diabteic. Good luck and take care!",

            "answer": "Good advice above. My goal is to test normal although I realise I'm diabetic for the rest of my life. I have lost 50+ lbs and gone from obese on the BMI test to a shade above normal weight. I credit watching those carbs; no more than 60 per meal. I expect my next A1C to be below 6%. Good luck",
