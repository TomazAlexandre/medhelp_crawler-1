    "question": "3 months a go I had a severe chest pain on the left side and eventually went to emergency service. It was diagnosed as chest wall pain and I was adviced to take iboprofen and rest. It has been 3 months although now it isn't severely painful it still hurts a lot and I suspect that diagnose may not be too accurate.I am currently unemployed I had no choice but to go to emeregency 3 months ago, but now I can live with it(i can breath now, 3 months ago couldn't even breath)I don't have insurance and don't have any info about health insurance and I do not have the financial power to pay for prospective tests that might be required for diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0According to my research chest wall pain must have been healed long time ago. What should i do to learn the cause of the pain in my chest?",
