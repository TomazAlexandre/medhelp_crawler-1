And I don't have a problem eating.\u00a0\u00a0I put a few pounds on and it goes away quick less then a week. I think I'm starting to look very thin. Went to eye doc cause had a problem with my left eye but he said I had very low blood pressure, and I think I might have some bad symptoms over the past year from it and still. Does anyone know what maybe causing this?",
