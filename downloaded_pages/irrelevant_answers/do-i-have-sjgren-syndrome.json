            "answer": "Hello Needtoknow,Please excuse my tardy response. I hope you are monitoring this site. Your questions, input and comments are important to us.I am sorry to hear about your un-diagnosed\u00a0\u00a0symptoms(SX). Unfortunately and according to the Sjogren's Syndrome Resource site reaching a diagnosis can often be difficult and has been found to take an average of 3.9 years from the onset of symptoms. That's a lot of wait time - causing frustration and fear.You are fairly young to present with this disease as the average age is late 40s. That fact may be one of the reasons your Rheumatologist is hesitant to DX (diagnosis) you with this condition.It can be a difficult disease to live with but if it's any comfort to you Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s is serious but generally not fatal.I am far from an expert in Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s but what I do know is any medical test that returns in the \"gray zone\" means what you think - it's not totally negative for the disease but it's not a strong enough reading to confirm you have the disease.This can be equated to ppl that have Borderline (gray zone)\u00a0\u00a0Blood Sugars. It's not a high enough reading/results/number to label someone with diabetes - but it bears watching. That's what your lab results are telling the physician.So no it doesn't mean that you will have Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s - but it does mean that you require \"watching\". There are additional tests that can be preformed. And remember that lab tests alone are not sufficient to diagnose any autoimmune disorder. There is a lot more that goes into a DX.I wish I had better answers. I can hear your anxiety and concern. My heart goes out to you. I know this may not mean a lot to you right now - but you are young - a lot of research is being done for causes and treatments and yes cures for Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s. It's very possible that there will be a cure or life changing treatment found for this condition. I've seen it happen in my lifetime with other disease conditions.I'm sorry Needtoknow but I doubt there's anyone that can provide you with a definitive answer right now. I know this is frustrating and frightening.So hang in there. Please keep in touch.Peace,~Tuck",

            "answer": "Hey Need2knoww.Grey is good!It means you have an opportunity to take measures to PREVENT Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s.Optimizing your immune system is a good start.Many autoimmune conditions have underlying imbalances caused by genetics (with the advancement of epigenetics we may be able to do something about gene defects in many cases), food sensitivities like gluten (elimination diet or specific tests), heavy metals detoxification),traumatic events ( therapy, eft, energy medicine etc).Leave no stone unturned!You mentioned your thyroid is fine.Can you verify you were checked for Type 2 Hypothyroidism as well ?(Thyroid resistance just like in Diabetes type 2).For this you need Free T3, Free T4 and Reverse T3 testsHypothyroidism is the precursor to many serious conditions!!!It is good to be very thorough! Conventional medicine has many gaps.Your dry mouth and dry eyes could be secondary to your anxiety.Did you experience any traumatic events in your life?Let me know and if you need any more details on anything, but please note that my comments and suggestions are not intended to replace medical advice.Best wishes,Niko",

Does it mean I have or will certainly have Sj\u00f6gren?ANA 0.5\u00a0\u00a0INDEXNormal values: 0 - 1.5I got also my thyroid checked and it's fine.I really need to know if I have any hope of not having this dissease (SS).Thanks!",
