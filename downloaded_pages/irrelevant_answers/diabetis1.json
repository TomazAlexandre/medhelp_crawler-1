            "answer": "My name is Krysie,I have been diabetic type 2 for 2 weeks now. I am very over weight, and also have asthma which makes it hard for me to do much exercises. The diabetic diet works great for me. I have lost 7 lbs! see every 15 carbs = 1 net carb. for breakfast you can have 2 to 3 net carbs, lunch 3 to 4 net carbs, and for dinner 4 to 5 net carbs. Of course i ususally only have 3 to 4 for lunch and 3 to 4 for dinner. They have put me on a 1800 calorie diet, but i ususally only eat around 1200, but only because im just not that hungry. Also you are supposed to eat about every 4 hours. so for snack you can have 1 to 2 net carbs. a good snack is carrots and lt. ranch or pretzel sticks w' 1 tblspoon of peanut butter. :D also, if you want to get fit and thin w/o \"killing yourself\" try walking and doing yoga at least 3 times a week. It really helps. I would add the exercise tracker, diabetic tracker, and food tracker. They really do help. I wish you the best of luck",
