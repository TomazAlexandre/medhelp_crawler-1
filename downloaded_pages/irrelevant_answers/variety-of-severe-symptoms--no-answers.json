            "answer": "Hello.I'm sorry to hear your mom is going through so much. I know trying to figure out the problem can be so hard on the person suffering but also the family and\u00a0\u00a0loved ones.I've suffered with Lupus, Budd-Chiari of the liver, Lupus Myocarditis, pericardial effusion, and blood clotting syndrome. Each time I begin to feel ill, my instincts, in regards to my illness, are always right. First and foremost, it is always so important to keep the pressure on her physician and any other doctor she visits.I suffer with the same symptoms on a daily basis but they are kept under control with medication and frequent doctor visits. The cause of my symptoms is my heart. Since October 2014, I have been in the hospital six times staying 4+ days at a time. The cause of my cold skin, sweating, fatigue, tightness in my chest, emotional distress, headaches, twitching thoughtout my body, burning in my back (this symptom is due to previous blood clots in my liver), and nausea is the myocarditis. Myocarditis is where a portion of my heart, and the muscle, are not keeping up with the surrounding heart muscles. This is a very serious condition and can cause death if it goes untreated for too\u00a0\u00a0long.I would definitely requst an MRI on her heart WITH contrast as well as an ultrasound. The doctors originally weren't looking at the outer part of my heart but only the inner lining. So, when my triponin levels were coming back at extremely high leves and I had not suffered a heart attack, I questioned if they had looked at the outside of my heart. I had already had a cardiac cath done and was told there was nothing wrong with my heart...um...that wasn't okay with me so I was persistant and it paid off...big time.I hope you get some definitive answers quickly and she starts to feel better.Brandi",
