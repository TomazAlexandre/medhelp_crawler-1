Breast milk is the most easy and natural thing for babies digestive system, because it has our immunities in it babies are sick less often. Breastfeeding is also linked to lower risk of gastrointestinal problems, upper respiratory infections, asthma, diabetes,\u00a0\u00a0and leukemia in babies and young children. Then there is the added benefit of it being cheaper, less supplies (dirty bottles), and you get more bonding skin to skin contact with your little one.",

Whichever you choose i wish you luck and I'm sorry to hear about your mom.",

It was tough!But anyway, I breastfeed because it's cheap, convenient for me as a part-time stay-at-home mom, it's easier to lose the weight, and it's so good for the baby and for me. Try reading \"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding\" before baby arrives. It will answer all your questions. Good luck! It's very worth it!",

It's just an easy way to feed them no buying expensive formula. You could always buy a hand pump if it feels\u00a0\u00a0awkward but that is a bit\u00a0\u00a0more time\u00a0\u00a0consuming but try it and if it fails then use a pump and use a bottle.",

    "question": "With my previous pregnancies I bottle fed all my babies. I still want to do the same with this one but since my mommy passed away from breast cancer February 22, 2014 I was thinking about reconsidering because I read up on breast feeding and it said if i breast feed it can reduce my chance of getting breast cancer. I still am freaked out about breastfeeding though. I've heard so many things about it that's why I decided to bottle feed in the past. April is approaching quick and I need to make my mind up fast! If you ladies can help me out on your experience with breastfeeding? I'll appreciate it.",
