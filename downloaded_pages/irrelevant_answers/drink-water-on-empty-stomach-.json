            "answer": "I've heard that drinking ionized water results in alkaline water that is cleaner, better tasting, and better for people. I believe it but I can't buy a ionizer right now. So I use the next best thing: Distilled water.Distilled water works much like that of a magnet. It picks up rejected and discarded minerals, which are debris obstructing normal body function, and then transports them to the kidneys for elimination from the system. Minerals which are usable by the body, become part of the body, and the magnetic action of the distilled water has no effect on them. So drinking distilled water is the best for cleaning out this debris from the system.As much as we need to drink water, one time that we should NOT drink water is with meals. Drinking with meals dilutes the gastric juice and slows the digestive process. So your absolutely right. The best time to drink water is between meals\u201420 minutes before a meal, and not until 2 hours after a meal\u2014to obtain maximum digestion of your meal. When you are ill, drink plenty of water. This replaces any fluid lost during a fever and insures that every part of your body will function well.",

There is a right way and a wrong way to drink it, sadly, it is not taught in most schools, not even naturopathic ones. It is so important too.",

However, the cold water will solidify the oily stuff that you have just consumed . It will slow down the digestion.Once this 'sludge' reacts with the acid, it will break down and be absorbed by the intestine faster than the solid food. It will line the intestine. Very soon, this will turn into fats and lead to cancer..
