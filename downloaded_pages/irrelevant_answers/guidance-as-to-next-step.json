            "answer": "You may have what's called a peripheral neuropathy which is a disease of the nerves to your limbs that in many patients start as numb/tingling in the distal parts like the hands and feet. An EMG (preferrably done at a major academic/clinical center) may be helpful as would be routine lab work to look for causes such as diabetes, thyroid, electrolytes. Alcohol is another cause as well as hereditary neuropathies. Treatment would consist of both symptomatic relief (neurontin, elavil) and of the underlying condition. Good luck.",

    "question": "Two years ago I began experiencing intermittant paresthesias in hands & feet. W/in months the paresthesias became constant & was coupled with intense burning sensations in my legs up to my thighs.\u00a0\u00a0Add'l symptoms: weakness in my extremities,particulary the left side, pressure around the left eye with occasional blurring, a recurring flu x6 feeling,sharp pains in toes, squiggly feelings at base of neck, numbness in my hands upon waking, right back pain & constipation.\u00a0\u00a0Fortunately I don't\u00a0\u00a0experience all of these symptoms at one time-the one constant is the paresthesis in my feet-and although I feel very tired at times these symptoms haven't physically disabled me in any way. Tests: standard blood work, MRI of brain &\u00a0\u00a0cervical spine w/contrast,carotid ultrasound,24 hour heart monitor,echocardiogram,evoked potentials. Tests were within normal ranges and/or negative with exception of MRI of cervical spine which indicated mild degenerative disc disease and the lower extremity EP study was inaccurate due to unfavorable signal-to-noise ratios. I've been examined by two Neurologists who found nothing neurologically amiss. First Neuro felt anxiety related symptoms should be considered;the second Neuro suggested Neurontin, which lessened the burning sensations(not constant)for about 6 months. When my symptoms became very intense in Jan we agreed to discontinue Neurontin inasmuch as it was not effective. The Neuro suggested I take Naproxen and perhaps consult an Internist.I've tried Accupuncture, Osteopath & do see a Psychiatrist since this began. Is it time to let this go & move on",
