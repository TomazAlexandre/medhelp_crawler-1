            "answer": "Hello!Thank you kindly for responding.\u00a0\u00a0Actually I had read about that condition and looked at some photographs, it is quite different from these lesions I have been experiencing.However, what you said led to some additional online searching.In answer to your question, I do have some other symptoms - I have at present a right hand I can barely use, quite painful, swollen with multiple trigger fingers, left hand starting to mimic the right.\u00a0\u00a0I have also had what I thought was seasonal allergies based upon skin on my face reddening with slight swelling occasionally and itchy eyes. My feet have been feeling frozen for two years, sleep with a heating pad at the bottom of my bed - they are not cold to the touch but the sensation is though they are in a bucket of ice water. Regardless I have been trying to maintain an active life because that so helps with the glucose levels and in general keeps me from being quite cranky!I attributed some of this to possible complications of Type 1 diabetes but did go see an Osteopath who ordered some blood tests. Also, I am often exausted - sometimes because of lack of sleep but sometimes I've had plenty of sleep and still feel just awful.So after running around the internet I discovered Lupus and I am wondering if that is not what is going on.I have a wonderful physician but am a self-pay client and the budget does not allow for too many tests or appointments. Insulin is very costly.I have also found that complaints at appointments about some of these things are not taken as seriously as perhaps they should.\u00a0\u00a0Because I have lost two of my three children (ALL and genetic hemochromastosis) and obviously experienced depression that some of this may be in my head. When I brought my hand into the DO's office he took it very seriously, nothing like some good ole physical evidence to stop that \"Are you in therapy?\" ridiculous question.Sorry to babble on like this - my own father is a retired GP but he's on the other side of the country and telling him my nail broke upsets him after what we have all been through.Thanks again for your response.\u00a0\u00a0I see the DO again this coming Friday.Take care!Alison",

            "answer": "Hi,I am really sorry to hear all that you have been through and admire your courage and approach.Considering your medical history and the other problems you mention, i have to suggest that you consult a certified physician and if possible an endocrinologist for your diabetes and its complications.It would not be advisable or possible to suggest anything without a proper detailed clinical examination and certain investigations.Let us know what your doctor advises and post us about how you are doing.Regards.",

            "answer": "Thanks again!\u00a0\u00a0Heartily agree - I go to Joslin Clinic every six months, diabetes in excellent control.I will certainly speak to the osteopath Friday, he is in an orthopedic practice and likely will be referred to an endocrynologist with all of this. Might have to rob a bank first!Take care - I will surely post when I have a name for this - really the sores on the scalp are most distressing, would love to rid myself of those.Thank you again!",

    "question": "I am 50 years old, a type 1 diabetic, otherwise in fairly good health.For about six years now I have had recurring sores on my scalp and a very itchy scalp at times.\u00a0\u00a0The sores are deep, scab over eventually but the scabs are very thick and do not go away on their own, even after months. While they remain the area is very painful and tight. I have to remove them myself, use topical drying agents and anticeptics.\u00a0\u00a0What remains is a significant dent in my scalp where hair will no longer grow.Has anyone else experienced these?\u00a0\u00a0I have never had success with the very nice but usually puzzled dermatologist in our area, creams and lotions cost a fortune and not a one has ever worked.",
