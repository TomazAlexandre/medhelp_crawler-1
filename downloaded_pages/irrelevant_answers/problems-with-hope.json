            "answer": "Okay first of all everyone has days when life seems way too much to handle.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes can make you feel despair because it seems like so much to do and and it is not going to go away.\u00a0\u00a0I get it--I have been diabetic for 27 years.\u00a0\u00a0It is a long time and a lot of shots and testing and going to the doctor andblood work, low and high blood sugar readings, believe me I KNOW!\u00a0\u00a0But what I don't get is the loss of friends.\u00a0\u00a0I am older and therefore wiser, but if you lose a friend because you are diabetic than I can't see how that friendship was ever a good one or a real one.Who exactly are you talking to?\u00a0\u00a0Did you try going to the JDRF website?\u00a0\u00a0It is www.JDRF.org, try going to that site and finding where you can look for your local chapter or an online friend with diabetes or go to the part of the site where it say life with diabetes and scroll down to teens.I think if you try talking to someone with diabetes you might find something other than sympathy and judgement.\u00a0\u00a0You will probably find understanding and someone who knows what you are going through.",

            "answer": "Hey, I'm Zac, originally from Texas but living in Maine (4 now).\u00a0\u00a0I've been diabetic type 1 since I was a young teen.\u00a0\u00a0Seriously, I can remember the first minute I knew there was something wrong with my body.After loosing eighteen pounds in a week, gone through at least 100 bottles of soda and water, I was in the hospital with a blood sugar lvl of 823.Years later, things aren't much better.\u00a0\u00a0Though our A1c is supposed to be seven or under, the lowest mine has ever been was 8.2.\u00a0\u00a0It's 9.3 right now...Currently I am suffering from nerve damage in my lower legs.\u00a0\u00a0No numbness or loss of circulation but it hurts like...beep.Hope...I understand how distant that sort of feeling is.\u00a0\u00a0In school, when I had to leave the room to take my blood sugar, or go to the cafeteria to get juice and bring my bs up, it wasn't uncommon to get accused of using my diabetes to slip out of class.\u00a0\u00a0One time a syringe fell out of my back pack and I was interrogated by the vice principal.When I got a job I took my insulin in the bathroom.\u00a0\u00a0Well, I almost got fired because the boss thought I was doing drugs.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is hell.Nothing is more pathetic than a diabetic type 2 patient telling me their success stories and how I should learn from it.\u00a0\u00a0For one thing type 2 is not near as fatal or bad as type 1. Secondly, type 2 can usually be prevented by not gaining weight.\u00a0\u00a0Why did I get diabetes? I was never near overweight.\u00a0\u00a0My doctors don't even understand.I get used to be scolded at by dietitians and other diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0I get warned a lot.\u00a0\u00a0Seriously, I know the dangers.\u00a0\u00a0I know that I am living on borrowed time and time is critical.\u00a0\u00a0Surely you know too, diabetes is very personal. Each patient suffers often completely different issues than others!I get so tired, I'm always so tired.\u00a0\u00a0I've missed a lot of school and work because of the constant fatigue and sickness.\u00a0\u00a0I have all the reasons to control my diabetes but I seem to can't.\u00a0\u00a0For a brittle type 1 diabetic to have an A1c below eight demands CONSTANT attention, focus, and concentration almost around the clock.\u00a0\u00a0You need to have a very uniformed sleep pattern, meal plan, snack plan, and exercise plan.\u00a0\u00a0In short, you might as well be a robot.\u00a0\u00a0I get depressed a lot.\u00a0\u00a0I feel diabetes takes away my freedom.\u00a0\u00a0And the cost keeps me in poverty.I pray for a cure.\u00a0\u00a0But we are always told about how a cure is just around the corner.\u00a0\u00a0I almost think its a conspiracy.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes treatment and medications bring in billions of dollars a year to our country's medical system. I know it may sound silly but something else sounds silly as well.\u00a0\u00a0It is 2007 and even though the glucometers have grown smaller and smarter, we are still sticking our fingers and injecting insulin.diabeticchick, I really and truly do understand your hopelessness, all my heart goes out to you.\u00a0\u00a0You are in my prayers.\u00a0\u00a0Let your story be one of triumph and survival.\u00a0\u00a0The only answer I have for you is to find your hope in the things that you love doing.\u00a0\u00a0Find hope in all that you aspire and dream of being and doing someday.\u00a0\u00a0Do not let diabetes have power over your heart and your spirit.\u00a0\u00a0Instead, fill your heart and spirit with the things that make you happy instead.Good luck and all my best to you.",

            "answer": "Nice comment above^^^^^.\u00a0\u00a0Just wondering are you still in school.\u00a0\u00a0I also believe that doctors and such tell their patients that a cure is right around the corner.\u00a0\u00a0They probably do it to give the people hope, or to help convince them that they need to keep lower a1cs.\u00a0\u00a0Also, isnt diabetes genetic?\u00a0\u00a0Dont you think you could have possibilly developed it cause it was in your genes. and in fact you did nothing wrong..so i agree, go live your life to the fullest.",
