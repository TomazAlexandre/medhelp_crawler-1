            "answer": "Hello,Recurrent urine infections could be due to various reasons. Most common cause is stones in kidney which is blocking urine pathway. Other causes are changing sexual partners frequently, pregnancy, diabetes and of course childhood infections.The urine can also be due to retention of urine anywhere in its flow due to obstruction. The obstruction can be due to abnormality of structures since birth, stones etc.So you should get a ultrasound, CT scan done to rule out kidney stones and also some urine and blood tests. I suggest you to consult a urologist.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "Hello,Blood in urine means hematuria. Causes include lesions of the urinary tract, contamination during menstruation, trauma, tumours, malaria or stones in the urinary tract.I feel that without clinical examination, pinpointing a diagnosis is tough. Also a complete urine examination and culture may be required. Please consult a urologist for confirming the diagnosis.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
