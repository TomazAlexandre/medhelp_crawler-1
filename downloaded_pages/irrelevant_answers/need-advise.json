    "question": "i had my weekly check up on Tuesday I'm currently 37w3d. I've got diabetes and I'm on insulin, every visit I have been to they put up my insulin dose. The past two weeks appointment I had 1 doctor said I will be going into labour around 38-39weeks not over my due date for me being a diabetic. But on Tuesday I saw a different doctor and she said something different, she said they won't induce me unless 40 weeks. I really don't want to go till 40weeks as I'm worried my baby will become to big and complications might happen. I asked her to give me a due date but she refused she said we will discuss it on your 39week appointment. Is that normal for her not to give me a due date?? It's just confuses me how 2 doctors say 2 different things. :(",
