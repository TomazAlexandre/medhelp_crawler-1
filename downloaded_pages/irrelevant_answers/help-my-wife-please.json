            "answer": "Just curious, but has she had her hormones/testosterone checked?\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, which is caused by an insulin resistant hormone.\u00a0\u00a0This can cause the weight problems.\u00a0\u00a0It is my understanding that unless the hormone is stabilized, diet and exercise wont do hardly anything.\u00a0\u00a0I now have to take Metformin (just started taking it) to get mine under control.\u00a0\u00a0Once this kicks in, with diet and exercise I should start seeing results.\u00a0\u00a0I also had 2 abdominal surgeries and my problems from this syndrome kicked in afterward.\u00a0\u00a0Probably unrelated to the surgeries, unless there's some weird hormonal imbalance that can occur after a surgery...;) (OK, you know I'm kidding) Oh, I tested normal on all of the same tests she took too.\u00a0\u00a0It wasnt until a DR finally tested my testosterone level and it was elevated.\u00a0\u00a0Unexplained weight gain and not being able to lose it despite true efforts is a sign of this that many people with this syndrome complain about.\u00a0\u00a0BUT, unexplained weight gain can be a variety of problems, but look into all angles.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

    "question": "I set up this account in hopes that my wife will see that their are others out there that know what's happening and understand. She has had 2 adominal tumor operations in the last year. After each operation she lost muscle response and gained weight. She has been going to the Gym, reduced her intake by 40%, takes her vitamins and drinks more water than most fish have to swim in, it seems. She has been actually GAINING weight! She has reached the end of her patience at 5'1\" and 230lbs. She has had blood work ups ... nothing, she has had full physicals ... nothing, thyroid test, diabetes test, hormone test ... and nothing. No thing that would cause her to continue to gain weight. Anyone know another step to take, a problem we may have missed?I have made this initial plee, and all corespondance will now go to her.Please help if you can,Concerned Hubby",
