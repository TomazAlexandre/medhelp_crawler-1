The whole basis of naturopathy is to look at the body as a whole and treat imbalances and weak areas.\u00a0\u00a0Thus you need to work with someone who has been trained - naturopathic doctors here in Canada undergo the same length of training as regular family doctors.Prednisone is very dangerous but for you is needed so therefore you need to understand that medication can cause problems but greater issues will happen if you don't take them.I wish you all the best and hope it gets easier for you!",
