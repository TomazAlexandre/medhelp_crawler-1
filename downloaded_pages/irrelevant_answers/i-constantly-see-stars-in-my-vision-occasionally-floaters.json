    "question": "Hello,I am only 19 years old and have no medical history. For the past 4 months I have had a problem which has been increasing over time. It used to be that just in the dark, my vision would get very hazy and I would see stars everywhere. Like hundreds and hundreds of speckled lights everywhere. I also would notice an occasional \"floater\" every know and then. It then progressed to when I looked into the sky I would see floating \"stars\" everywhere. Now EVERYTHING I look at is starry all over the place ALL the time. Its not that it lasts for 5-10 minutes at a time but it is constant. I always see hundreds of speckles/stars/particles or whatever you want to call them flying around.I'm not too sure and I do not know what to think or do.Your opinions mean the world to me.",
