            "answer": "Thanks for your post.\u00a0\u00a0You make a great point that losing weight is good for your health, from diabetes to heart disease to everything in between.\u00a0\u00a0It would be helpful to know what kind of heart surgery is being recommended, because sometimes there are procedures that are less invasive that could be considered, and could result in some improvement in how you feel.Weight loss surgery can be a great option for some people, but keep in mind that it often does come down to surgical risk.\u00a0\u00a0I think that getting more information is a very good idea, and I'd suggest that you ask your primary care doctor to recommend a surgeon in your area, if only to discuss your operative risk and also to learn more about the various procedures available.\u00a0\u00a0I think this is the next step for you.\u00a0\u00a0If you'd like to post further about your heart condition, I can try to provide more information.\u00a0\u00a0Take care!",

            "answer": "Your low ejection fraction does increase your surgical risk, even in the absence of any significant blockages on your recent angiogram.\u00a0\u00a0I do think that speaking with a surgeon still would be useful in terms of understanding your level of risk better.",
