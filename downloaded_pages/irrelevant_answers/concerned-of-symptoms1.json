I know the exam and tests are not pleasant, but if anything else is going on, you really need to know and more importantly, NOT knowing and NOT getting treatment could result in really bad consequences... please see your doc and let her/him know everything...Best to you...",

    "question": "About a week ago i caught a urinary tract infection. Or atleast that is what i thought and was told that i had. It started off with blood in urine. Got antibiotics been taking them ever since. Since then i have had no bleeding. Only mild burning when i urinate. I also took cranberry juice as well to help it out some more. Since then it seems to be going away. So i don't know if these symptoms i am experiencing are related to my symptoms below.For the past few days i have been experiencing symptoms. I have had tingling in my forearms and my shins. As well as muscle aches on my upper leg and forearms. I don't believe i have excessive thirst. Usually drink around 4 cups of water throughout the entire day. Or frequent urination. Although i do have the feeling of wanting to urinate even after i have finished urinating. So i end up going to the bathroom because of it. Only to urinate it very little as if i didn't need to. My urine does have an odor but i don't know if these urinary symptoms are because of the urinary tract infection that i have.Sometimes i lose sleep over these symptoms. Mainly because i am overly worried and stressed about them. So i am hoping if i could get an opinion or advice please. Thank you for your time.",
