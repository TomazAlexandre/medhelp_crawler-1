            "answer": "The diagnosis of PCOS is made if you have any two of the following: irregular periods, excessive hair growth and/or elevated male hormone levels, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. If any two of the above are present, then there is no need for a more detailed exam. The hormone levels to be tested are testosterone, +/- free testosterone, DHEA-S, TSH, prolactin, FSH. Were these done? Also, if you have PCOS and are overweight, it would be reasonable to screen also for diabetes.The treatment for PCOS depends on your goals. If you are trying to get pregnant, then fertility medication would be the appropriate treatment. If you are not trying to get pregnant, then you require a medication that contains a progesterone drug in it, such as the pill. The reason is that progesterone, which is only released by the ovary for two weeks after every ovulation, protects your uterus from cancer. If you are not ovulating , then you need to get progesterone somehow, and the pill is great choice for most patients.Ovaries are not painful with polycystic ovary syndrome, and so one cannot attibute your discomfort to polycystic ovary syndrome.",

            "answer": "Sorry, I got cut off....Until you want a family. One test is to get a pelvic Ultrasound, which is what they did to show that I had PCOS. It showed a lot of abnormal cysts, and that's why I was getting my period. The b.c. pill can be used, because it should give you your menses, but I'm trying to concieve.I'm on Metformin and Clomid. I also got a colposcopy due to the abnormal cysyts to make sure they are not cancerous. So, 1) Pelvic/vaginal u.s./ 2) Possible bloodwork.It's also good to get 2nd opinions if you don't feel comfortable with what your Gyn thinks.",

The provera pills are just for helping you start your period each month, NOT to ovulate!!!!\u00a0\u00a0Just because you have a period DOES NOT mean you ovulated!!!!\u00a0\u00a0If your doctor is giving you provera to have a baby I would see another doctor, I would see a specialist, because most OB GYN doctors are not experienced enough with PCOS because it is actually an endocrine problem.....there are fertility specialist that are also Endocrinologist....that is the BEST person to see if you are Serious about having a baby!!!!\u00a0\u00a0They usually with start you out with Metformin pills, which is to controle your insuline (eventhough you might not be diabetic, People with PCOS have insuline resistance.) Then they will give you Clomid pills (an ovulation drug). If these don't work there are further measures to take, and more advances have been made every year for infertility due to PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0If you need to talk my email is babygirl_garcia81***@****, good luck!!!!!",

I can have 4- 12 months break between my periods. but everyday I feel quite a lot of pain and discomfort.This feels exactly like PMT.2 months ago I have been dignosed with policystic ovary syndrome. I was prescribed contraceptive pill as a treatment method but I am still experiencing a lot of discomfort and pain. I would like to know if there is another treatment method for this condition.
