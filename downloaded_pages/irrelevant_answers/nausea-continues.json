            "answer": "hi, I am sorry you still have so many problems with the nausea. i don't know if you are taking any medications for it, and also whether you have tried different ones. (my oncologist prescribed about 3-4 different ones so I could take what worked best?) and the medication that I preferred over all the other ones is called Reglan. i just wanted to tell you this in case you are interested. it's very safe, and doesn't make you as drowsy as many of the other ones. it works pretty much by speeding up the emptying process of food in your stomach. (i.e. chemo really slows that down, and some people with diabetes also have difficulty with this proces) Anyway, it really helped me. kat\u00a0\u00a0PS: also make sure you are not dehydrated.",
