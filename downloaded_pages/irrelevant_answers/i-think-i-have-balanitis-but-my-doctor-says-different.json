            "answer": "How are you? Balanitis is inflammation of the glans penis.Inflammation has many possible causes, including irritation by environmental substances, physical trauma, and infection by a wide variety of pathogens. Diabetes can make balanitis more likely, especially if the blood sugar is poorly controlled. Diagnosis may include careful identification of the cause with swabs and cultures. It would be good to confirm the diagnosis and see your doctor for proper management.I hope this helps. Take care and keep us posted.",
