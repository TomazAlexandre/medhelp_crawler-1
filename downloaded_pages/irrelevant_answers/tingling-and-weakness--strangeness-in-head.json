            "answer": "I would consider a referral to a neurologist to examine the nerve symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Nerve conduction studies and a brain MRI can be considered as initial, comprehensive testing.Blood tests looking for vitamin B12 deficiency, thyroid dysfunction and diabetes should also be considered.\u00a0\u00a0I would also consider an ANA level to rule out rheumatologic disease.If negative, stress and anxiety can certainly lead to some of the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0However, I would exclude more serious, neurologic disease, before attributing the symptoms to stress.These options can be discussed with your neurologist.Followup with your physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

            "answer": "I had been experiencing similar symptoms and had the same tests done as you. I felt nausea, fatigue, headaches, muscle weakness on the right side of my face, difficulty breathing, etc. I finally looked up my symptoms online and came across a website about carbon monoxide poisoning. I bought a test for the home and put it in my car. Sure enough, my car had been emitting these poisons. I then began to think back to when I was the most sick and I almost passed out in my car. If they test you for it, it will be through blood work. However, I think the carbon monoxide leaves the body and can be difficult to find after a certain amount of time surpasses. I hope this helps you. The only cure they can give you is pure oxygen. Take no chances-get the carbon monoxide test. They sell them at walmart for about twenty dollars. God Bless You, and i hope you find what ails you.",

    "question": "About two weeks ago I began getting symptoms of slight weakness in right arm. I had this before and blamed it on lots of computer work.\u00a0\u00a0However this time it was different in that it moved to legs.\u00a0\u00a0I have been having tightness in calves, pins in needles in legs,legs fall asleep easily like when I put one on top of the other. Tingling then tightness in face, usually on right side though sometimes not.\u00a0\u00a0Face seems sensitive to cold/tightness more likely when subjected to cold.\u00a0\u00a0Feels like there is sometimes movement inside my head and it's mostly on my right side and nearer to the top.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes seems to happen same time as change in symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0My left arm has a cold feeling \"inside\".\u00a0\u00a0I also noticed this in my legs today, like there's someting cold touching them but there's not.\u00a0\u00a0Had sore back - started with tingling, then burning.\u00a0\u00a0All symptoms seem to last about a day and then move on.\u00a0\u00a0Also feel tingling on my ear and sometimes get a sore ear when my face is tingling.\u00a0\u00a0I feel nauseous and can hardly eat.\u00a0\u00a0I have lost ten punds in these two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I've been through a tremendous amount of stress in the past eight months.\u00a0\u00a0Have had at least one anxiety attack before (5 years ago). Latest symptoms started immediately after I completed a major career task which had been a source to some of my stress.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I'm falling apart.\u00a0\u00a0Seeing a neurologist next week but wanted to know whether they might sound anxiety related or not.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
