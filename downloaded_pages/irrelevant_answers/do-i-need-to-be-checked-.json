            "answer": "It would be worth getting checked out by your primary care doctor.\u00a0\u00a0The three most important metrics are blood pressure cholesterol and glucose. I'm 50 and have a family history of heart disease and have done a considerable amount of research this past year.\u00a0\u00a0Modern medicine will tell you that a lot of it is genetic, but that is not necessarily true.\u00a0\u00a0The inherited tendancy is only a predisposition and it doesn't necessarily dictate the outcome.\u00a0\u00a0Many of these conditions results from various external factors.\u00a0\u00a0Lifestyle is probably more important as is diet.\u00a0\u00a0I would probably also ask for an LpA test if cholesterol levels are questionable as it is a genetic risk factor not altered by diet or exercise.",
