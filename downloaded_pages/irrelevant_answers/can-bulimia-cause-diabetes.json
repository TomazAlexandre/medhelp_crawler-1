            "answer": "I have it now, and I was bulemic from 12-19(ish), messing with your blood sugars can trigger issues. Diabetics need to regulate their blood sugars, many aren't insulin dependant, but I have to watch what I eat and drink. My GP said being bulemic sure didn't help me at all. Go to your doctor if you have questions, you may have a genetic disposition like I do, though I didn't know it.",
