            "answer": "Banking your babys cord blood is an excellent program. My husband and I looked into it with our two youngest children (as it wasn't offered with our 3 older ones). There are a couple of things you must consider and weigh against the cost. Do you have a genetic history of health concerns. This would be the reason you would bank cord blood, or if your child should develop a form of cancer down the road.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, the cost is a monthly payment to pay for the cryo, and it isn't cheap. However, you need to look into family histories on both sides. Cord blood is primarily used as \"stem cells\".\u00a0\u00a0I have a 17 year old that has had chronic blood issues and at one time was thought to have ALL. The cure for this is Bone Marrow or Stem Cell transplants.\u00a0\u00a0Fortunately we did not have to undergo that, but there are kids everywhere who do. Kids with cancer undergo Chemo to destroy their marrow and need to obviously replace it from a donor. We decided to donate our childrens cord blood for that exact reason, we knew that the cord blood would be tested and used to save a child in desperate need of stem cell transplant. And the beauty of it is that stem cells don't require a \"match\". Everyone can use them.\u00a0\u00a0I don't remember the exact company but you can look online. We were sent the collection package which we took to our physician to look at, we then brought it with us at delivery. The hospital called the courier provided by the company and it was sent. Very smooth, and our children now have a certificate in their baby books that they can see how they may have saved a life of another child :).\u00a0\u00a0Donating the cord blood was totally free. I wish more people would consider cord blood donation. Good Luck and Congratulations.",
