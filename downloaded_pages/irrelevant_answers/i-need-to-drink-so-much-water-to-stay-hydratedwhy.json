            "answer": "You're making a few incorrect assumptions here.\u00a0\u00a0For one, you're assuming you are always near dehydration if you don't consume your 8-10 glasses of water a day.\u00a0\u00a0That's not true at all, and the only way you would KNOW that is by having blood tests done.You're also making the assumption that when your urine is darker, you are dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0That is also wrong.\u00a0\u00a0It just means, the less water you drink, the more concentrated your urine is, when you drink your 8 glasses a day, your urine is more dilute.\u00a0\u00a0Neither situation is better or worse than the other, as long as you would drink a few beverages a day (with normal exertion), you have nothing to worry about.Dehydration is not something that happens willy nilly.\u00a0\u00a0It really takes some extreme circumstances to interrupt the balance that much to cause dehydration,\u00a0\u00a0For example, a stomach virus with a lot of vomiting and diahrrea would put one at risk, because you are losing fluid faster than you can put it in.\u00a0\u00a0Same way with extreme exertion (sports) without drinking water.\u00a0\u00a0That would also place you at risk.\u00a0\u00a0Going from 8 glasses of water to 2 isn't going to do that.So, to answer your question, NO, you have nothing to be concerned about.\u00a0\u00a0You are musinterpreting what it means to be dehydrated.",

            "answer": "That was really informative.\u00a0\u00a0But years ago when I did a pee sample and my urine was darkish yellow the nurse said, \"you need to drink more water...enough so that your urine is almost clear.\"\u00a0\u00a0So I've been using that as a gauge ever since.Also I get sooo thirsty.\u00a0\u00a0Esp in the morning after a small breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0I need like 60 ounce of water in the first hour of my day before I feel not thirsty anymore. Isn't that weird????",

            "answer": "Additionally, some foods may also cause your urine to have a dark yellow color. If you are drinking enough water, but your still have dark yellow urine color, then it may be food based. For example, beets, blackberries and asparagus can cause a dark yellow urine color. If you feel it's not food related perhaps it's time you visit a doctor for a full health evaluation, testing your kidney, bladder and liver functions. Be sure to take a list of all medications, supplements and vitamins you take for your doctor to review. Good luck -btw, how is your pre-diabetes?",

Being too high if I'm thirsty all the time?\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if this means anything but I bought a finger poking BS test kit and have been checking my BS levels throughout the day for a couple weeks, and it's always a very normal reading--obviously higher after meals but I've never seen it over 145 (and that was right after dinner).\u00a0\u00a0Usually I'm in the 90s (I'm I'm not fasting).Also I seem MOST thirsty after eating sweets.\u00a0\u00a0Is that a normal reaction?\u00a0\u00a0If I'm not eating sweets I definitely do not get thirsty all the time.",

            "answer": "I think I have a very similar problem to you. I'm 29, fairly athletic (BMI 23 and fairly muscular) and constantly have to drink water (4-6 liters per day). I do exercise quite a bit but even on days that I do nothing I require quite a bit more water than the average person.I've had every single possible test the docs could think of to discover the problem. Sugar comes back perfect, kidney perfect. I'm writing this at 1 pm and I've consumed 3.5 liters so far today and I feel thirsty. It drives me a little nuts as I prefer to drink filtered water due to the taste but both of the 1 liter Nalgene bottles I carry around are empty.I do sweat quite a bit. It is possible that if you're in an environment that allows your perspiration to evaporate very quickly you may be losing fluid much faster than you might think. I suspect this may be the case with me. My brother who has the same build/height as me does not have the problem.I wish you luck in your search for an answer.",
