            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Any abnormal sensation in lower extremities while trying to sleep is usually due to\u00a0\u00a0\u2018restless leg syndrome\u2019 (RLS). The leg pain of RLS typically eases with movement of the legs and becomes more evident at rest or while you are asleep. Usually cause of RLS is not known but few medications such as lithium, antidepressants and beta-blockers (such as bisoprolol) can trigger the symptoms. Other reasons of RLS could be rheumatoid arthritis, kidney failure, diabetes or any underlying heart disorder. In addition restless syndrome has been found to be associated with stress, fatigue, magnesium deficiency, vitamin B-12 deficiency, anemia and other systemic diseases. Though there is no permanent cure of RLS, regular & sound sleep helps get relief from symptoms. Supplements of iron/vitamin also help some. Sometimes medications such as levodopa, bromocriptine, oxycodone may be tried to provide some relief from the symptoms. Avoiding alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine may partly relieve your symptoms. Other useful measures are stretching, alternate hot and cold packs or baths, massage and applying vibrators on the feet and legs before bedtime. Relaxation and meditation can also help. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Consult a sleep specialist. Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "So this has been happening ever since I was little, but only recently has it been happening more often and becoming more uncomfortable.Basically I hop into bed, and as soon as I relax I get this uncomfortable sensation in my thighs, buttocks and groin area. It is really really hard to explain. Sort of like a yawn but in these areas.The only way to relieve this sensation is by tensing my legs and buttocks. This only relieves it for a couple of seconds. It comes back as soon as I stop tensing.If I don't do this, I get a painful warm tingle all over my body and then I have no choice!It is so annoying and uncomfortable sometimes I toss and turn and end up crying myself to sleep.Thanks for any help, I'm desperate!!",
