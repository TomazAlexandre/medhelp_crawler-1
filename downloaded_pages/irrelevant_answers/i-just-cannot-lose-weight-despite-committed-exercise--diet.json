            "answer": "First off, I think you are restricting your calories too much.\u00a0\u00a0Your body has to have so many calories, in order to function properly - you should only restrict your calorie intake by a few hundred, then make sure you use an equal amount in exercise.That said, I'd have to ask if you've been checked for a thyroid disorder; hypothyroidism is a very common cause for inability to lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0Type II diabetes or insulin resistance is another........ you should get checked for both.\u00a0\u00a0For thyroid, you should have TSH, Free T3 and Free T4.For insulin resistance/type II diabetes, you should get a hemoglobin A1c and check fasting blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Talk to your doctor.",

            "answer": "Thanks Barb, but I've had a good run of blood tests lately because of all the injuries, the ones you mention I had about 6 weeks ago and they were all clear.I'll try recalculating my calorie in take and watching for the next 2 weeks, see if it makes a difference.Thanks again,Vicky",

            "answer": "Sorry, reading this over, I see in your original post that you had thyroid tests done.\u00a0\u00a0I do hope they tested more than just TSH, which is not a good indicator of actual thyroid hormone levels. You should also have had free T and free T4.\u00a0\u00a0If those levels are low in their ranges, you could still have trouble losing weight.A couple more things to keep in mind - it looks like you are doing, pretty much, the same work out every day, except adding the weights on Mon, Wed, Fri.\u00a0\u00a0It's best to switch it up, so your body doesn't get used to it and it's no longer a challenge.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe you could throw in a 30 minute walk a couple days/week or 30 minutes of yoga, or something, just so your body doesn't get used to the same things.Another thing is, with all the exercise, you are building muscle.\u00a0\u00a0Muscle is denser than fat, so you may be losing fat, just not weight.\u00a0\u00a0You should also check your measurements and/or note how your clothes fit.Types of food you're eating makes a big difference as well.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you're opting for as many fresh veggies, as you can, with lean protein, low/no fat dairy, etc.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the follow up.Yep, I've had pretty thorough thyroid tests as my mum has has issues with an overactive thyroid for many years.A lot of what you've said about exercise I am doing (just didn't want to bore with an opening post) but having you say it back to me does help reassure me that I'm doing ok in that area.\u00a0\u00a0So, thanks!! I either increase resistance, pace or include sprints.\u00a0\u00a0The type of exercise is consistent but how I 'execute' varies.\u00a0\u00a0Saying that I think I'll start rowing every other day and perhaps ditch the weights as that should compensate.Seems like I do have to take a much closer look at my diet as I'm burning 1000 cals a day at the gym.",

    "question": "I started at the gym almost 3 months ago and have lost just 4lbs.\u00a0\u00a0At this point, I should point out that I'm 5ft 9\" and currently 13st 2lb.\u00a0\u00a0My physical comfort weight range is 10st 10lb - 11st 3lb, so I have just shy of 2st to lose.Due to a range of injuries (I'm a wreck) I've had to tailor my work outs to only include non-impact and fluid motionTue & Thur:20 mins circuit training (weights & cardio)60 mins med-resistance on eliptical trainer10 mins power platesMon, Wed, Fri:20 mins circuit training (weights & cardio)60 mins med-resistance on eliptical trainer20 mins weights (leg press, shoulder press etc)10 mins power platesSat:20 mins circuit trainingSundays are rest days.My 'maintain' calorie intake is circa 2500 calories and my diet is restricted to 1500 calories.I'll also note that I had a fair few blood tests lately (hormones, thyroid etc) and I also have naproxen and tramadol as repeat prescriptions, with amitryptiline added this week.What more can I possibly do?",
