    "question": "I tested recently & found high insulin in my blood (fasting in morning). Against a norm of\u00a0\u00a0maximum 9, my insulin level was 21.47.\u00a0\u00a0But my sugar levels are ok -- fasting 96; PP (2 hours)-- 139; HBA1C-- 5.8%. All these show non-diabetic condition. I am otherwise obese 82.5 kg height 1.63 m (5ft 4 in) and suffer from high BP (150/100 without med. and 130/90 after taking morning Natrilix SR and Amlopress 2.5 mg and night alprazolam 0.25). I also suffer from depression. All these appear heriditary. My doctor advises that high insulin will lead to pancreatic fatigue in 5-10 years and prescribed pioglar 30 (ranbaxy) after dinner. I have been taking this for last 15 days. I am finding lot of fatigue increasing after starting medicine and willpower to work rapidly going down with wanting to just lie down whole day. Mornings specially bad, with no desire to walk excercise etc. My pulse is heriditarily low running between 58 and 66 due to condition called partial right bundle branch block in the heart, which i am told by doctors is a condition without significance and does not require pacemaker (only LBBB condition requires which is not my case). I am 56 years old. My sexual desires have never been very high unless on some drug/aphrodasiac/hormone, which i dont normally take. Pl advise on my health as the health status is affecting my work output and efficiency, which has gone down last 3 years and i feel tired all time without enjoyment------jaypee",
