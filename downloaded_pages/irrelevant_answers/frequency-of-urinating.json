If you think it is a problem, then talk to your doctor. They can do some testing and find out what is going on.",

            "answer": "I would make an appointment with your doctor. Do you have a good diet? If not, I would ask to be checked for diabetes. You don't have to be overweight to have it. I'm skinny myself and have pre-diabetes, very close to that line. Also, just to let you know, the sphincter muscle is only for your anus. The muscle for holding your urine is your pelvic floor muscle. You can try doing kegel exercises and see if that helps. That may be good to do no matter, what. Though I would still make the doctors appointment and see what they say. If you have diabetes, it isn't something you should ignore.",

            "answer": "If you had a muscle problem you would have problems with leaking urine. I would get an A1C test done which checks your sugar level average for the last three months. One of the signs of pre-diabetes (which i also have) and diabetes is frequent urination which you have if you are going every 2 hours or so. The body is trying to get rid of excess sugar in the body. See a doctor about this.",
