            "answer": "Start to read everything you can get your hands on, and stick with what resonates with you. Recovery in any process means consistent learning. Try meditation, and living healthily in the moment. As for your boyfriend being defensive, you may have to engage in marriage counseling. His being defensive is going to sabotage your recovery, and that's not okay. If he can't start fresh, and live in the moment, he may not be the guy that you need. No one can erase the past, we can only learn from it.",
