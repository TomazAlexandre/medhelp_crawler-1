            "answer": "Almost everyone will develop antibodies up to 8 weeks, no doubt. So your 13 week test is more than excellent and proves that you don\u2019t have HIV.There are no illnesses or medications that affect HIV test results. The only exceptions are life-threatening illnesses like terminal cancer, very potent chemotherapy or immunosuppressive drugs. Delayed seroconversion or late seroconversion = urban myth, because of tests that are available today, and no matter which Ab test you did, it is conclusive at that time.To say 1 in 65 000...Hmm..\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure. We do not have that information. But we can say that only those who are near death may not develop antibodies. Usually they are already hospitalized for other conditions, but generally it has not been much of them so far.",
