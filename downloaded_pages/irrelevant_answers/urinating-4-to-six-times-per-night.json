            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Excessive fluid intake and GU infections, increased urinary frequency could be related to GU inflammations, growths/ masses, neuro-muscular causes, hormonal/ endocrine issues, diabetes etc. I would suggest getting this evaluated by an internist initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
