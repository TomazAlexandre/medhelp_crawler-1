            "answer": "Hi!Obviously your question is one that only you and your family can answer--I assume you are considering terminating the pregnancy. There are a lot of moral dilemmas associated with that as well as some medical/surgical risk with that procedure too.If my patient decided on termination, I would advise her to do it ASAP--in fact probably the \"medical abortion\" with RU-486 would be optimal in your case because most of the time it doesn't involve surgery.I have also seen countless people go through a third c/section and TUBAL ligation at the same time! I think if you are well prepared, with good ultrasound information, at a good medical center, and with expert surgeons, you should do fine--of course there are never any guarantees in life!I would advise my patients AGAINST a normal vaginal delivery.If you DO go through with the pregnancy, make sure that they provide you with the things listed above--like a high risk specialist, etc.\u00a0\u00a0You can also bank your own blood (freeze a pint or two) under many circumstances even while you are pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0If you are going to do that--its better to start early.I hope I haven't misunderstood your question!Hope the information is useful!Good luck with your decision!Dr B",

            "answer": "I was told after having my first child that I should really think long and hard about having another. My first one was a vaginal delivery, 3 weeks early and 9lbs 1oz, I also had toximia and gestational diabetes. I gave birth 22 months later with my boy who was about 21/2 weeks early, emergency c-section, and 9lbs 14oz. (no diabetes) Two days after having him I had to have 2 units of blood given to me. A little over 2 years later I gave birth to my 3rd and final child. he was 3 weeks early, 9lbs 5oz and also a c-section.. except for this one was planned. My suggestion is to pray really hard about what to do. I personally do not believe in abortion unless deffinate death or serious injury is possible. My suggestion is to talk to your doctor and discuss the pros and cons to having this child. Miracles do happen every day and this could be one of them. Just keep in mind that it isnt that unborn childs fault that he/she was concieved and it deserves every right as the next child at a chance for life. thanks",
