            "answer": "Usually, you don't have to do the 3 hour test unless you didn't pass the 1 hour glucose test, I've never heard of someone taking the 3 right off the bat, if that's what you mean... I took my 1 hour test a few days ago and never had to do the 3 hour (third pregnancy here), because I tested negative each time.Anyway, you're given a glucose drink that tastes kind like Gatorade and basically sit around until time passes and then they draw your blood. This is a test to see whether or not you may have gestational diabetes by testing your blood sugar levels. Most doctors will tell you not to eat anything sweet (if anything at all) hours before the test, or it could cause a spike and you could get a false positive.",
