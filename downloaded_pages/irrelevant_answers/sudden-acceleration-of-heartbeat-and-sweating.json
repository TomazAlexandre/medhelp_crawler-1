            "answer": "Hi tom, I did not measure mt heart pulse. the heartbeat acceleration starts suddenly but ends gradually (while lay down and resting). when it starts I first feel anxious, then I get so irritable/uncomfortable (hard to really explain). After that it comes the nauseous feeling and the dizziness (seeing while spots).At that point I feel like all energy have been drained out, and that when I have to lay down as standing or even talking becomes more troubling.I did at some point think it might be some sort of diabetes but according to blood tests I don't have diabetes.",

    "question": "I am 28 years old going into 29. I am 5\" and 117 lbs. I have no family history of any heart diseases.What usually happens is that my heart rate would suddenly start accelerating, then I start feeling dizzy, sweating and light headed and nauseous,\u00a0\u00a0every motion becomes too much of an effort such as standing, talking or anything. All I usually can do it to lay down and try to relax until it goes away (it usually takes from 30-60 mins to feel functional again)This have happened few time in my life, I remember the first time I was 16 and setting in the living room and just finished drinking coffee, I thought maybe i had to much coffee for the day and just let it slide. It is usually associated with those days that I don't eat well, however I consider myself very healthy, I'm not a fan of junk food and I do workout but get into some periods of laziness.This also sometime happens after an intense cardio workout even if I have done the workout many times before with no issues.I am just trying to figure out what might be the cause for this. it is becoming an issue as the last time it happened I was in the mall and I basically had to get help to get home and I was in no condition to drive or even walk.",
