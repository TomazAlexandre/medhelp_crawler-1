            "answer": "Hi,This may be a case of stomatitis or cheilitis. Also, mild lip irritations secondary to a dermatitis or an allergic reaction may cause scaling or cracking of the lips.I suggest that you seek consult with a dermatologist. You may need topical antibiotic medications. This may also be a fungal infection.Microscopic evaluation of skin scrapings from the area may help ascertain the presence of a fungal infection.Drink plenty of water everyday. Avoid hot beverages and spicy food. If you have any allergies avoid any known triggers. Avoid applying any lotions and creams on the lips as this may only aggravate the condition. If this has been present for quite some time, an underlying vitamin or nutrient deficiency also need to be ruled out.How old are you?Do you have any other associated conditions like diabetes?",

            "answer": "About 6 months ago a small area near the corner of my top lip started to crack, became slightly more red than the surrounding lip area, and flakes continously every day. Sometimes it gets slightly itchy. I have tried cold sore creams, and moisturizing lip balms A LOT and neither of these have any effect. I have also been drinking huge amounts of water every day. I have also tried going for weeks without applying anything to the area and this also has no effect, the small area just keeps on drying out and peeling away.I am 24, very fit and healthy, with no allergies.I assume you would just suggest going to see a dermitologist...?",
