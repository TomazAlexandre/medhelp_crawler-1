            "answer": "Hello,you will need to keep increasing your insulin dose until it does work.\u00a0\u00a0You are taking steroid which means that you could be quite insulin resistant and will need quite a high dose.You should be using both basal (long acting) for your background blood sugar and bolus (short acting insulin) to cover meals.Are you working with a diabetes educator?Would highly recommend the book diabetes solutions by Dr. Richard Bernstein as it explains well how to use insulin, and also alow carb diet to help reduce how much insulin you actually need.",

    "question": "I was maintaining my blood sugar between 80 - 120, only taking Glipizde 5 mg twice a day.I was having a problem with my toes on my left foot, so my doctor gave me Lyrica.After about a week my blood sugar went way up. Talked to my doctor and he said to quit taking Lyrica.My blood sugar never came back down, after several months of closely monitoring what I ate and increasing myGlipizide to 2 tablets twice a day. Nothing, still high.I am now on Insulin glargine (rDNA origin) injections, and have been increasing the dosage bi-weekly and still nothing.Anyone got any idea how to get this under control? Wish I had come to this board before I started taking the Lyrica. I tend to have problems with drugs quite often.I have Crohn's disease, with a foot of my Ilium, Cecum, and Ascending Colon taken out.I suffer from a pinched nerve in my neck that affects my shoulder and upper left arm, get shots once in awhile which helps.I have a damaged nerve around my mid section caused by Shingles, which can get quite bad at timesArthritis in my knees, which I get shots that help.The drugs I am taking:AciphexBuspirone - had a bad side effect to Tegretol, which caused permanent extreme anxietyCyanocobal (B12) injections - no terminal Ilium.GabapentinGlipizide XLHydrocodone/APAPInsulin Glargine (rDNA) orgin)Metoprolol - bad side effect to Purinethol caused permanent Angina/High blood pressureRapaflo - Urination problem",
