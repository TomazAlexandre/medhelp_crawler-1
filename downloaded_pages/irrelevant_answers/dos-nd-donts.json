Eat stuff with fiber near the end of the first trimester or if u get constipated(i didnt want to use one of the kinds u mix with water so i eat the nutrigrain bars:)) if ur suffering from morning sickness, eat before u get out of bed, and eat small meals throughout the entire day, if u keep ur belly full u dont get as sick! Dont take any medications without talking to your dr first unless its tylenol extra strength which is the only pain medication i know u can take. Good luck hun!",
