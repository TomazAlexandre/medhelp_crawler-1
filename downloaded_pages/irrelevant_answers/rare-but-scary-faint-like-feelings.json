            "answer": "lynn,Your symptoms are pretty nonspecific and its hard to tell whats going on with an internet post. With your past history, I wouldn't think that your symptoms are specifically cardiac related.I know its hard to trust your physician, but you should explore why exactly you are not comfortable with their opinion of your symptoms and have come here looking for more help.There isnt a good cure for orthostatic changes in blood pressure other than hydration and a few medications with limited success.good luck",

            "answer": "the same thing happens to me often. ill think i feel dizzy and get a little panicky.. but when i stop and take a second to analyze what im really feeling, its vertigo dizziness, not a fainting dizziness.. The key difference is you arent seeing spots or getting tunnel vision, you should still mention it to your doctor though.",

            "answer": "Hi after reading a few of your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosied with gastroparesis (slow stomach emptying) 3 years ago, but then I started experiencing other really weird feelings in my body, which doctors kept saying were psychosomatic or menopause, as every blood test done showed nothing.\u00a0\u00a0I finally figured it out myself after overseeing one test that came back with a blood sugar level of 2.\u00a0\u00a0I believe the levels should be between 5-11 in australia.\u00a0\u00a0When I questioned the doctor he said it was because I was fasting, however it was not, I had this test done 2 hours after eating lunch.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have diabetes. I have low blood sugars, that fluctuate all the time, one minute I would be perfectly fine and the next minute, like a light switch went on and a sensation that I could not explain apart from saying bizarre would creep through my body, I'd feel faint, tingling lips, dizziness, confusion, strangest feeling in head (thought stroke) very frightening, I would almost pass out, weakness, heart ponding, this would keep coming and going.\u00a0\u00a0I would then instinctively drink a can of lemonade or eat something very sweet, which seemed to make me feel a lot better, however after 2-3 hours I would experience these attacks again and sometimes even worse, as now I believe when the blood sugar raised with the sweets it would then a few hours later plumpite again as I was not eating anything to sustain a balanced level - so I was peaking.\u00a0\u00a0I then started to wake at night calling out in my sleep then experiencing the same dreaded feelings. I have now started eating every 2-3 hours and lighter meals (heavy meals still play havic with me). I have been relatively attack free except for 4 months, which is the first for 3 years, If I do experience attacks I instantly eat 6 jelly beans which pushes my blood sugar levels ups and eat a piece of wholemeal grain bread, as when the levels drop, they only drop half way and then meet the food I have eating, so seem to even out.\u00a0\u00a0I had been living this nightmare every day for 3 years - I can't tell you the relief I feel know there was actually something wrong with me.....hope this can help you...but please make sure you keep seeing your doctors...",

            "answer": "I have a similiar problem, though my arrhythmias are few and far bewteen, I have PVCs and very rarely tachycardia , well controlled with atenolol and cozaar , nearly 42 year old male.gallbladder removed in 93, over 300 stones, coventional 7 inch cut, took quite a while to recover.I also have glucose intolerance 2 docs say borderline/ mild diabetes, 3 say glucose intolerance I test at home , from what I gather i agree glucose intolerane if i keep on a strict diet completely normal blood sugar, basically same reading since 1990. Also have a connective tissue disease/disorder.I personally think my PVCs and tachy are related to my glucose intolerance and also my connective tissue problem, so far 2 cardiologists agrees that is probabaly the cause though essentially normal cardiac evaluations.",

    "question": "hadan ablation for PSVT about 3 years ago.stillhave a few skipped beats and flutters but nothing very sustained &my palpitations are very much better. I am taking 40mg. of prozac & a tiny amount of klonopin.I hate taking drugs & was sure they would backfire & make palps worse but amazingly I am having way fewer palps. I do have,rarely,light headedness. Sometimes I have taken my blood pressure in the morning & it drops when I stand & I have a little pulse pressure, for example from 110/68 sitting to 95 /75 standing. I figure i need to drink more water or gatorade. this doesn't happen all the time but it has scared me. Also, while sitting and talking with a friend, happily chatting for an hour, recently felt lightheaded and faint. I did not feel my heart beat out of synch, did not see stars or gray out. Later that day i got an earache and have had some vertigo this week (ragweed is getting to me) I wonder if i am confusing an inner ear thing with \"faintness\". Because i have worried so much & know a lot of docs due towork,have managed to have almost every heart test in the book from ep study to probably 25 holters(echo stress test in feb.totally normal),even microvolt alternans (volunteered as a control to get the test HA!totally neg.)everything always fine except benign pacs,few pvcs.I did \"fail\" (BP dropped did not faint)a tilt top table some 15 years ago but no one seems interested these days in following up. just told exercise (do a little but my heart scares worry me)stay hydrated.Docs think i'm anxious,heart fine. any explanation for these occasional weak fainty spells?",
