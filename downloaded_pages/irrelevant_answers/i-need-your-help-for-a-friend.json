            "answer": "A couple of things I would try.....I love ovulation predictor kits.\u00a0\u00a0Especially if she has a somewhat irregular cycle, she might find them really helpful.\u00a0\u00a0I really liked the ClearBlue Easy Digital, but they are a bit pricey.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I took clomid for 3 or 4 cycles and it was the only time I did not conceive.\u00a0\u00a0I am not entirely certain of the stat, but I think it's something like 20% of women have this happen....clomid can create hostile mucus actually preventing conception.\u00a0\u00a0She should ask her Dr. about it, I am not sure if there is a way to test for it, but I would think there would be.\u00a0\u00a0And finally, I took robitussin (the cough syrup) starting about 5-6 days before ovulation.\u00a0\u00a0It helps increase the amount of fertile mucus (it has to be the right type though...only 1 active ingredient.\u00a0\u00a0Google it for the right name, I can't remember).\u00a0\u00a0Oh, and a few last tips....cut out or cut down on caffeine and alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0Only because it deydrates and again, can decrease fertile mucus.\u00a0\u00a0Increase water intake as well.That's all I can think of.\u00a0\u00a0I hope it helps.\u00a0\u00a0Your a good friend for trying to help her out.\u00a0\u00a0It's so frustrating and heartbreaking to see those that really should be moms having so much trouble.\u00a0\u00a0I hope it all works out for her.",

            "answer": "Another monitor that works great for women with irregular cycles is the ovacue.\u00a0\u00a0No monthly sticks to buy but initially it is a bit more expensive.\u00a0\u00a0I checked into it before I started to get pregnant and they even have a rent to buy option now.http://www.zetek.net/ovacue_fertility_monitor.htmSupposed to be more accurate and tell you sooner.",

            "answer": "PCOS stands for polycystic ovary symdrom.According to my MD a small dose of Glucophage can help with PCOS (this medication is more often used for diabetes, in bigger doses). He recommended I take it because I was not able to get pregnant anymore after my last miscarriage, and as I had nothing to loose I took it ... funny thing is yes I did get pregnant 3 months after starting the Glucophage but my OB-gyn does not think I ever had PCOS.... though I did have a giant cyst that killed my left ovary years ago.",

            "answer": "no you don't have to be overweight for PCOS BUT it does affect the chances of having it and many women who have it are overweight. From what I've learned (and someone correct me if I'm wrong) if the woman gets to an ideal weight her cycle should go correct again.was her cycle fine when her weight was down?When your overweight your body produces more insulin which is why ppl may need diabetes medicine to help conceive.",

    "question": "Ok so I have this friend, she was my best friend throughout HS, but lately we dont seem to talk much and everything has been strained.Ok heres the story~My friend is 31 and has been TTC for about 7 years. Well the day before her big 3-0 she found out she was pregnant! I was so excited for her! I have always wanted to be pregnant with her and sit and talk about babies. Well I had had my 3rd son at this point but had started TTC again becuase it took so long the last time around. A week later I got my BFP!! Yay!! We are going to have babies a week apart! Well around week 10 she m/c. She had an u/s and the baby didnt have a hb and stopped growing some time ago. Well her baby was due August 09, same as mine. She lost her baby Dec 08 and since has not been able to get pregnant again. She has been on 4 rounds of clomid as far as I know but refuses to go to the doctor for more tests. Her bf wont get tested either, he says if its meant to be it will be. He has an 11 year old from a previous realationship so he says its not him. She doesnt have a regular cycle either hence the clomid from her doc. I keep telling her it will happen again because she was pregnant once but things arent looking that good:~( Is there anything she can do to help increase her odss/??? I have told her to take prenatals and to BD every other day leading up to the big \"O\". Is there anything eles??? I have never had too much trouble TTC except with #3 and that is all I basicly did and I eventually got pregnant after almost 2 years but with er its been 6!! I would love to get a phone call from her telling me she got a BFP!! Sadly she was one of the only ones to even come visit me in the hospital after my DD was born even when it must have been hell for her:~( She has such a good heart and would make a great mommy, why is it that she cant get pregnant when she wants it sooooo bad and other just drink the right water and end up knocked up?? Im so sad for her right now:~(Thank you in advance,Tabitha",
