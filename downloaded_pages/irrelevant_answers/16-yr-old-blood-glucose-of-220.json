            "answer": "Hi!If you have a family history of diabetes\u2014either on your side or on your son's father's side, then in all probability your son too has diabetes. Fasting level of 220 is pretty high as you probably know. Stress, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, infection etc can contribute toward the increase. Other than this a high energy drink, a drink rich in carbohydrates can be the cause.\u00a0\u00a0Please consult your PCP for primary examination. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you for responding ! I thought it was too high as well, and my mother does have diabetes and was put on insulin yesterday. He is definately not obese or sedentary in any way. In fact, he is quite active and skinny. He has never had a primary physician so we went to a Dr on Monday about these concerns and he treated me like I was an idiot ! When I told him that we checked him and his fasting glucose was 220, he said \"Well where are those labs then\", like I was making it up. I told him it was on a meter and that my son doesn't feel good quite often. This man treated me so badly, So I decided we should probably go to see a different Dr.. Are you located in Las Vegas, or could you reccommend one that is ? My son is on full medicaid. With Grammies history I am a little concerned.",

    "question": "Yesterday morning we got up to take our diabetic grammie to a health fair, while there I tested my glucose which was 92. I also tested my 16 year old sons, and his was 220. He hadnt eaten that morning and only had an allergy pill, an ibuprofen, and a glass of water beacause of a headache (pressure behind his eyes) and didnt feel good ! I've made an appointment with a primary physician but its driving me nuts, could it mean anything other than diabetes ?",
