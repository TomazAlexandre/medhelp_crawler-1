    "question": "I am 18, I have been diagnosed with IBS.\u00a0\u00a0Lately, after I eat (not al the time) I get kind of dizzy.\u00a0\u00a0Is this normal for people with IBS or should I be worried about diabetes. I don't really know the symptoms, but most of my Mom's side of the family has it and my mom had a thyroid disorder before she died. I also get kind of hot and tired once and a while! It hurts under my right rib cage and in my back near that area. Can someone help??",
