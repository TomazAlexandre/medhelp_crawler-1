            "answer": "Your whole life is gonna change! You can espect that. At night itll get hard for you to sleep comfortabley. My friend got one of those O shaped pillows and put her belly in it at night and it'd be much more comfy for her. You may get sick a lot. If you do, eat some crackers right before you get out of bed and it should calm it down a bit. If you have some bleeding, dont hesitate to get it checked out. If you have horrible pain, dont wait to go in! Youre probably going to be gassy! It may be embarassing. You'll be peeing more most likely. Gosh theres so much stuff...i cant even think of it all at the moment. Im sure whatever I dont cover a bunch of ladies will on here",
