Low magnesium is was what was caused my mood swings. This is what I was taught no vitamin d means no magnesium, no magnesium means no calcium.",

    "question": "I am 44y.o. male - fairly healthy - former military.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with Vit D Deficiency in October.\u00a0\u00a0I am a now a contractor in Afghanistan and back in September I began feeling weaker and weaker.\u00a0\u00a0I thought I just had the flu. On two separate days, I \"crashed\" so bad\u00a0\u00a0that they took me to the clinic but couldn't find any problems.\u00a0\u00a0I was sent to Dubai - where, again nothing was found to be wrong with me - no diabetes, heart problems, thyroid - nothing!\u00a0\u00a0I came back to Afghanistan where I again \"crashed\" and they sent me home.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor found it on the 2nd test - thankfully and I got \"better.\"\u00a0\u00a0I was at 16 on the test.\u00a0\u00a0I started taking the 50K IUs and after 3 weeks came back to work in Afghanistan.When I returned back, I found that the stress, high altitude, and rapid pace have been extremely difficult for me and sometimes I just feel so lethargic, tired, and overly emotional.\u00a0\u00a0In part because of the holiday and homesickness - but sometimes I am an emotional wreck when I feel \"exhausted\" from the deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0I know that is what it is because a couple hours later, I will be a LOT better.\u00a0\u00a0I keep telling myself to \"wait it out\" and the funky-feeling will go away - it's just not a good way to live day-to-day, even really minute-by-minute.Does anyone else have their symptoms change minute-to-minute?\u00a0\u00a0Is anyone else emotionally depressed at times from this?\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate any stories/advice because I can feel totally different about every five minutes.Also - I worry if there is more to deal with besides Vit D Deficiency - like Cancer, MS, thyroid, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Is that normal to have - even though I had FLYING COLORS during two separate physicals.I can't tell \"everyone\" here what a blessing it was to find this site to know that I am not alone.\u00a0\u00a0I am a bit of a worrier and being away from medical care has made me go crazy sometimes with concern for what is happening.\u00a0\u00a0Just reading the stories of others has greatly encouraged me to push through, even in this difficult situation.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks ahead of time for any responses.",
