            "answer": "I haven't been personally, but I have a friend who has been denied insurance, partially because of thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0He has Graves Disease and had his thyroid removed many years ago. He also has type II diabetes and high blood pressure, both controlled with medication, but definitely contributing factors; he's been denied insurance by several companies, and thyroid has been listed as partial reason for denial.I'm planning to retire later this year, and most likely will run into the same issues.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have diabetes (at this time), however, I've been on med for high blood pressure for many years, and of course, my Hashi/hypo status, along with pernicious anemia...... should be good for a few denials.",

            "answer": "Hey LM:No denial of coverage, but with change to Medicare Anthem Blue Cross Freedom Blue from Health Net, Cytomel went from costing $35 to costing $85. Nightmare. The only other company that even had it on their formulary was Aetna, and the cost was the same. There is no price break for ordering it from mail order 3 months at a time, whereas before, I got 3 months worth for the price of 2 months. The pressure to change to generic medication is economically intense, and if you try to get generic medication for a lesser price through Walgreen's or CVS programs, they will not assure you that it will be from the same manufacturer every time for consistency of potency.",

            "answer": "Yep , its play time till 2014.If there denying thyroid patients, then they must be denying around 25% of the public. I would guess around 25% has more (worse) health issues than thyroid. Rule of thumb, if they dont ask,..........then dont tell.Ive been paying for dessicated out of pocket for a couple years without ins Rx , its relatively inexpensive, but they dont like it. Go figure.And ins has dropped many Rx meds this year for other conditions from what I have heard.",

I have had to change health insurances at least four times since the TT (17yrs ago), but NOT once was I ever denied, nor did I have to pay higher premiums. Some forms asked about medical history & I listed it, but no problems stemmed from it. Now I am only on my husband's insurance as opposed to mine offered here at work.",

LOLI think this mostly applies to individual insurance - they are most likely to look at everything.Group coverage seems to have way less questions. I have never seen thyroid on the 'check off box' list.There is also the law that states you may be denied new coverage if you did not previously have any. Very high deductible is still included as 'coverage' , so people at need this as a minimum.",

    "question": "Health insurance is a hot topic as the prices soar and they cover less and less, no shocker there. Changes are happening at a very fast pace all of a sudden, and, of course we get the short end of the stick.Some basic meds are not even covered at all by some insurance companies now.I have not personally seen any insurance company list hypothyroid on there current conditions list or denial of coverage list, but apparently this can be the case. There are different state laws that pertain to this as well.So anyone had coverage denied or pay even higher premiums based on their thyroid disorder recently?",
