But it will only cause contractions if your body is ready like any other home remedy your body needs to be ready. I've been drinking 3 cups a day everyday for a week and I've had 1 contraction but I'm only 35 weeks so my body isn't ready but I'm hoping this does help it prepare. I'm also taking 3 evening primrose oil capsules a day 2 orally and 1 vaginally.",
