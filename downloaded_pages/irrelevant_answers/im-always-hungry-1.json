            "answer": "Before my first pregnancy I hated chocolate and sweets. I got pregnant and it seemed like I could never get enough of sweets. I was very bad I was 130 and ended up 203...scary. I couldn't control myself so losing the weight was hard. Its been three years and I'm having my 2nd baby this time I'm disgusted with sweets, raw meats, and pasta. I love meat and pasta but it turns my stomach but I'm drawn to lots of fruits now I can't get enough lol",
