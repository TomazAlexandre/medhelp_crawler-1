            "answer": "HI,First congrats to your husband for doing such a great job with exercise and diet changes--those are very difficult to implement, so excellent work!His A1C is overall very good, although not entirely \"normal\" as in \"not diabetic.\" His average glucose is consistent with this A1C. He could be higher during the night as well as after meals so those are two areas you could investigate.\u00a0\u00a0Continuing with dietary and exercise changes are the best things he can do to prevent further increases in glucose levels. If it does come to needing medication, he is far from needing insulin right now. Oral agents would certainly be the first steps.Cinnamon has some data but not a ton, but may be worth a try. Other herbs have less data in western trials, but I am not against them as long as they are not harmful to your husband be sure he discusses even herbal remedies with his doctor as well.Tae care and all the best to you both.",
