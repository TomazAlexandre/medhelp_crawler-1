    "question": "For the past year or so, whenever I get hot or feel overheated, I get very painful pins and needles pain starting in my lower abdomen that travels up to my neck (but not down my arms). I feel like I am being stabbed by thousands of needles. The pain only occurs in my torso (abdomen, chest, breasts, back, lower neck, armpits), It occurred mainly around my menstrual period but now occurs almost every day, several times a day. If I cool my body down (ie...move from a hot shower into a cool room) they stop. Sometimes I feel chilled when this happens, but my body feels hot to the touch. I have been to two doctors and they won't give me any answers just tell me to take Advil. This is making me very scared. I am a 21 year old female. Has anyone heard of this condition?",
