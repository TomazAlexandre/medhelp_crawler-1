            "answer": "Lol...I would like to know the logic as well. I'm a little thick but my Dr never told me to watch my weight. Luckily, I've only gained 5 pounds, but I understand most of the weight will hit me in the third trimester. I'm not looking forward to it, unless it's just the belly weight. :)",

            "answer": "I agree, I was 238 pre-pregnancy and I lost 15 in my first trimester. It wasn't until my third trimester that I starting gaining it all back. I gained all 15 back by 30 weeks, by 34 weeks I had gained 12 more pounds, by 36 weeks I was at 22 pounds total weight gain. Luckily I dont have a mean doctor who tells me im fat lol. But I went for my 37 week check up on wednesday and I lost 9 pounds (in a week idk how that'possible!\u00a0\u00a0Lol)I also hate that since I was only advised to gain 10-15 pounds I have to really think about what I eat and the cravings I give into. -___-",

            "answer": "Just because you are heavier doesnt mean you arent healthy. I've had no complications my pregnancy. I have excellent blood pressure, no gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and my baby is weighing normally for 37 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0 I think it really depends on how you take care of yourself.",

            "answer": "The reasoning is you already have enough fat stored to support the baby where a thinner person doesnt. So thinner ppl need to gain more so the baby is healthy. As long as the baby is growing you should be fine. Like the comment above be too big can cause problems and complications. My ob hasn't said anything about my weight they jus make sure the baby is growing. I was 215-220 prepregnancy and my weight ranges from 220-228 at each appointment. But he is growing bc my belly is bigger lol.\u00a0\u00a0Jus eat healthy and your babies should be fine and hopefully your dr won't be an a s s",

My blood pressure normal and all other risk factors are low so maybe thats why I really don't know.\u00a0\u00a0I've gained 21lbs and when I started losing weight because I wasnt eating right because I was working 70+hrs a week he got on to me for the hours but nothing else. I have liver issues but thats the omly thing and that was a preexisting condition",

            "answer": "With my first I was 100 lbs pre pregnancy. My 2nd I was 120 and 10 years later. I've been told too watch my weight gain and I was also personally wanting to watch my weight gain. It's a lot harder to lose after baby than before. I've always been told that 25-30 lbs is a normal gain. I want my pre pregnancy body back as I'm sure most woman do. I don't think doctors are mean for it I think they're just stressing the importance of eating healthy and such for baby. Instead of a bag of cheetos eat an apple..Instead of devouring a gallon of ice cream have a smoothie etc..",

    "question": "Ok.. I find this so annoying.\u00a0\u00a0I read alot of these weight gain posts. Most women who are \"heavier\" like myself always get told to only gain 10-15 lbs. But thinner set women are gaining 30-60lbs. Please tell me the logic of this. If your fat dont gain but if your thin its a damn buffet! .. sorry rant over!",
