            "answer": "Thanks Waverider, I'll try to remember using upper and lower case.Listened to the Novolog Flex Pen Demo. Have been researching this problem like a demon ,,, I'm a little Hyper!!My family doc has been in touch with Nordisk, My heart doc and family doc both say try different places , love handle, thigh , flabby part of upper arm .. until it starts working!I'm heavy\u00a0\u00a0.. big stomach .. best guess is that I was trying [unsuccessfully] to inject through FAT!!\u00a0\u00a0Tried love handle today , not able [without help] to pinch the flabby part of upper and inject . Actually tried one of those clips that keep snack bags closed .. to no avail.Had a big stream of insulin pop out when I tested the First Injection today , the second test was normal .. a couple of drops .. maybe its starting to work, I need to be patient , I think and stop panicking!!Nordisk is sending\u00a0\u00a0a Diabetes\u00a0\u00a0consultant\u00a0\u00a0next Wednesday at the family doc's. I'll be there.I have been injecting over 60 units [the limit on Flexpen] , using the same needle.Now using two needles .. starting yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0Just picked up from the demo that prior to using each needle , I should roll the pen back and forth and up and down .. for each needle!!. I'll start doing that.Hope this posting\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/ comment\u00a0\u00a0wasn't too lengthy. Thanks again.",

            "answer": "Update: NOVOLOGMIX 70/30 FLEXPENMet with the Diabetes Consultant.Looks like most of my assumptions were wrong!!She verified that before each injection I should roll the pen back\u00a0\u00a0and forth and up and down .. ten times each.\u00a0\u00a0[ I suspect that this is A VERY IMPORTANT STEP] !!Since I'm taking two injections back to back\u00a0\u00a0,, it is not necessary to change needles, but I must do a test shot each time (2 units).It is perfectly normal for a big stream of insulin to shoot out during the test shot.I will now take a blood reading , and inject\u00a0\u00a010 minutes before eating , am and pm.I'm\u00a0\u00a0changing when I get up, setting the alarm each day at 7:00am -- 7:30am in order to test and inject\u00a0\u00a0early hopefully by 9:00am. I am also using a sleeping pill ,If I eat an early dinner ( before 4:30pm)\u00a0\u00a0, I wont inject until 5:30pm.( per the consultant)She examined my stomach , and didn't see any reason why I could not inject 2 inches from my belly button.Since Sept 3rd , thanks to you via the Nordisk demo, I began rolling the pen as demonstrated .Sept 5th am\u00a0\u00a0 blood sugar came in at\u00a0\u00a0141 !! . .\u00a0\u00a0lowest since Arpil 2009., 9/6 5:00pm:169, 9/7 1:45pm: 135, 9/9 4:00pm:83\u00a0\u00a0[drank some orange juice] [day of the consultant visit]\u00a0\u00a09/10 8:30am:148 !!, 9/10 3:00pm 118 !!I see that the insulin is\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 working , now that I'm using the proper procedures,and trying to inject ,eat\u00a0\u00a0on a somewhat regular basis.My lifestlye is such that I only eat two meals a day , complicating my control, I carry glocuse and try to eat a pretzel around 1:00pm every day.I wont be surprised\u00a0\u00a0to have near future bouts of severe low blood sugar.I'm familiar with the program . . .\u00a0\u00a0massive muscle spasms, leg cremps!!My dosage(s) were raised because of my high blood sugar level reading and periodic blood tests.!!I wont change my dosage on my own!I'll track and report my stats regularly to the family doc: am blood sugar , inject time ,brkfast time, pm blood sugar[prior to dinner] , inject time and dinner time.One thing thats new : I used to be able to tell or feel when my blood sugar was low , and I would take Glocuse ! . . .Now I can no longer tell\u00a0\u00a0. . If I feel different sweaty, dizzy , shaky\u00a0\u00a0 or just not comfortable . .\u00a0\u00a0I will test my blood sugar and act appropriately.Doc\u00a0\u00a0will schedule me for a Diabetes class\u00a0\u00a0to revisit\u00a0\u00a0the basics of Diabetes care.I very much appreciate WaveRider's suggestion that I view the Nordisk demo . I THINK\u00a0\u00a0I NAILED IT ! !\u00a0\u00a0[preparing the pen - rolling rolling rolling roll on!\u00a0\u00a0]If anyone would like to comment or ask any questions , feel free!!",

            "answer": "Hey, great news that you learned all the proper pen techniques and that you're getting a handle on your glucose levels. And, thanks for posting back what you've learned too. Very good information.Have you ever though of making a YouTube video on how you, the patient, uses the pen? I think it would benefit many to see a video from a real patient. Just my opinion.Don't let diabetes take control of your life, take control of your diabetes. It's a challenge that you have to work at everyday, but if you like challenges then it becomes fun to learn new things about yourself. Keep up the good work.",
