            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!I would suggest you consult a doctor ASAP. You either have some problem at the cervical vertebral level or in the brain. I would say cervical vertebral level is most likely like a pinched nerve, prolapsed disc, canal stenosis, slipped disc etc.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I have been controlling my type 2 diabetes with actos, lipitor, lisinopril, amaryl, and metfirman for the last\u00a0\u00a02 years. Recently, i was laying down and when I got up I felt my neck grinding. A few days later I noticed my tonuge was numb and tingling. then I noticed my right eye and right side of my face and head was numb. I have been having reduced mucle movement on that side. I do not have insurance and am unable to see a doctor. I get my diabetic medical treatment at a clinic. They are not equiped to handle nerve issues. We have a local hospital that takes people who cn not pay for services but it will take at least 3 weeks to get registard and make an appointment. should I wait for the appointment or should I try some other way to see a doctor immediately? Can anyone give me any advice.",
