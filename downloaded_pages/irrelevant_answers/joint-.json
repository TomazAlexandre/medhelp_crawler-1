This does not mean it is not related, just that I have never run across others who have experienced these symptoms.I am so sorry about your health care. I know how frustrating it can be. Please keep following the comments as you may recieve more info in regards to your situation.Best Wishes,dm",

            "answer": "Sheesh!\u00a0\u00a0You've been thru a lot!I have read elsewhere about frozen shoulder, trigger fingers, carpal tunnel, etc being complication of long term diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Like you, I've had this disease a long time (~35 years).One of the first suggestions is always to improve our blood sugar control if it's not already excellent.\u00a0\u00a0Many of these symptoms can be eased with better blood sugars.Tinnitus can sometimes result from (high) blood pressure and so I'd encourage you to have that checked out, too.\u00a0\u00a0Home blood pressure monitors are available for $20-$40 and is a great investment if you can possibly afford it.\u00a0\u00a0Some pharmacies & supermarket drug stores even have free blood pressure machines.If your blood pressure is above 120/80 (max max max), then there is room for improvement by modifying diet/exercise and/or taking BP meds.\u00a0\u00a0There's a category of bp meds called ACE inhibitors that're even recommended to diabetics with normal BP as kidney protection.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a physician, but hope these ideas are helpful and will perhaps give you something more to discuss with your endocrinologist.Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you'll check back and let us know how things are going.",

I have also heard that joint pain and muscle pain are other indications. I do have rheumatoid artritis and some of your symptoms (jaw problems and joint pain) are somethings that I deal with. RA diagnoses is a very simple blood test and it maybe be worth checking out with your doctor. Again, I'm not a physician and am coming at this from my own personal experience.

            "answer": "Hi, I've also had diabetes melitus for 33 years and have suffered from the complications for just over a year now.For long enough my doc has been saying it's just your age and it's the onset of arthritus but after doing some research I've discovered that it is actually trigger finger adn frozen shoulder that's wrong with me and there are treatments available.They start out with cortisone injections into the hood that covers the tendons, where it attaches to the bone. In most diabetics this only has up to a 50% chance of success, which means the next srep is an operation to release the tendon and this is much more successful.I'm going to see my GP tommorrow and my next appointment with my diabetes advisor is in March and everyone had better watch out because I'm sick and tired of being told I've just got to learn to live with this imobility when I know there are treatments available.You definately should go see a good endocrinologist and have a complete check up by them.",

I have been blown off by my ortho doctor who basically tells me to better control my Diabetes and I wouldn't have shoulder problems. My over all A1c's have been good.

It's still not \"normal\" but it isn't a problem anymore.

            "answer": "I've had Type I diabetes for 25 years and definitely sympathize with the pain and frustration associated with frozen shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0I've had frozen shoulder both on the left and right sides, at different times.\u00a0\u00a0The first was the right and lasted about 5 years.\u00a0\u00a0The pain was excruciating when reaching for things or making sudden movements.\u00a0\u00a0Often the pain kept me from sleeping on my back, my stomach, or either side and soon I found myself taking pain medication (Talacen/Vicodin) and sleeping pills (Ambien) to get a decent night's sleep.\u00a0\u00a0I tried cortisone injections, physiotherapy, acupuncture, chiropractic, massage, and nothing seemed to work.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, after all else seemed to fail, my doctor and I decided to try surgery ('arthroscopic' I think).\u00a0\u00a0During the surgery my doctor found nothing inherently wrong with my shoulder but decided to remove a ligament that would have the affect of releasing some of the pressure on the inflamed area.\u00a0\u00a0He also manipulated my shoulder and removed some scar tissue.\u00a0\u00a0It worked, although I still am skeptical that surgery was necessary.A few years later I got frozen shoulder on my left side.\u00a0\u00a0This time I was determined to avoid surgery.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor prescribed physical therapy again several times but still I got very little relief.\u00a0\u00a0But I noticed that what little relief I did get seemed to be associated with the therapist's doing soft tissue work, much more so than the exercises.\u00a0\u00a0Luckily, I found a therapist on the internet who claimed to have a lot of experience fixing frozen shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0She practiced what she called 'Tandem Point' therapy - I guess you could describe it as a combination of massage therapy and acupressure.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, after about 4 to 5 visits I was virtually pain free and had recovered about 90% of my mobility!!\u00a0\u00a0Since then she has moved out of the area but I have found similar practitioners to manage my occasional 'flare ups'.\u00a0\u00a0'Rolfing' has also been effective for me.\u00a0\u00a0These treatments aren't typically covered by insurance but even so it's cheaper than surgery. And lastly, drinking lots of water everyday seems to keep my muscles and joints a little happier - makes me wonder if us diabetics are chronically dehydrated??\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, my suggestion to you would be to find a good massage therapist who is very familiar with frozen shoulder and even better aware of it's relationship to diabetes.Best of luck to you!",

            "answer": "I am now in physical therapy and I too have found a wonderful therapist who does exactly what yours did. The Tandem Point therapy really works! My left shoulder is doing much better. I am still struggling with my right and I think it is because it is still in the Freezing Stage which we all know can become painful for up to 5 months after the onset. I have a question for you. Did you ever experience pain and tightness in your lower arms and wrist? Almost like there was a rubberband being tightened around your wrist? I saw a specialist and he said he doesn't think it has anything to do with carpel tunnel but rather the shoulder instead. What is your opinion on this?",

That being said, I do believe there is a strong relationship between problems with the lower arm and the shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0I would tend to think that stiffness and immobility of the lower arm would me more likely to cause problems in the shoulder than the other way around.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to me that if the lower arm is stiff and in pain, you'd be likely to tense up and compensate for it some other way, and that could translate to the shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0Do you work with your hands a lot or use the computer several hours/day?",
