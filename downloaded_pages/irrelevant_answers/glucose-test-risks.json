I'm honestly not concerned about having gestational diabetes, even with family history of diabetes. All my family members who have it, it's weight related(obesity) and I am the exact opposite. I'm 105 dripping wet, as the hubby puts it, when not pregnant. So far this pregnancy both baby and myself have been relatively healthy (I have GERD, only pregnancy related) but aside from that, healthy. My Dr says I'll have a big baby, about 6lbs, which for my petiteness is big and my first born was 4.13.",

            "answer": "Will your doctor let u have it done at an outside lab? I worked for Quest and you can go there and have it done. I had gestional diabetes with my son hes 11. Im currently about 8 weeks. I think that there is more health risk than big babies if you have it. My sugar went high a few times and it was very concerning. People end up in the hospital with high sugar. I work in a hospital now. So big babies is not the worst thing. Please talk to your doctor.",

Unfortunately I now have no one to watch my 6 year old autistic son for me and get him to school, so it looks like I may have to opt out on having the test done. Does anyone know what the risks are of NOT having the test? Or has Anyone opted out of it and been ok, or had diabetes. I'm just really worried and don't want to put myself and my baby at risk but I have no choice in missing it.",
