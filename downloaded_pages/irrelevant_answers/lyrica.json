    "question": "Im fixing to have surgery in a couple of weeks and my doctor prescribed me lyrica today.Does anyone know if this will help?Ive already had one procedure done.They basicaly went in and shave some of my disc off to take pressure off of the syatic nerve.Not sure what they call that but i do have the paper here i got from the doctors office.Im just waiting on workers comp to approve the surgery and i need to go get these filled today.The doctors report said(description of surgey lumbar laminectomy discectomy fusion lumbar four five with decompression bilateral lateral fusion lumbar four five possible posterior lumbar fusion).Then it says in real tiny words next to it segment fixation harvest iliac bone graft tangent allograft intraoperative monitoring system.I guess the best way they described it to me was that there going to hook something to my spine to monitor me while im under to make sure that if i start having complications it will detect it?",
