            "answer": "A. You have a number of symptoms, and some could be due to perimenopause.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms like hot flashes, palpitations and forgetfulness all could be due to it.\u00a0\u00a0Losing urine happens to 1 in 3 women and is common. It may be due to perimenopause but can also be due to changes in your tissue. Many women are embarrassed and wait up to 3 years or more to tell their doctors.\u00a0\u00a0Tell yours. Maybe your own gynecologist can also help you and if not, ask for a referral to a urogynecologist who deals with these problems.Your tingling in your feet could be due to many things.\u00a0\u00a0Since you have arthritis and a back ache, you could have a bulging disc that is in your backbone or a bone spur or other problem putting pressure on your nerves and causing the tingling.\u00a0\u00a0Mention this to your doctor also and ask if you can have a referral to an orthopedic doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, pathology that shows proliferative endometrium is very good and means there is no cancer of the lining.Machelle M.

            "answer": "Another thought, as I get older and heading towards menopause, I thought menstrual periods would slow down but they have not, actually are getting heavier than ever before.\u00a0\u00a0They're probably not very heavy compared to many women, but for myself, they are.\u00a0\u00a0My periods have always been scant, but are getting heavier.\u00a0\u00a0Another reason Dr. did D&C, which was just done last week.",

    "question": "I'm 52, perimenopause I think, still monthly periods, had postcoital bleeding, had US, D&C, hysteroscopy.\u00a0\u00a0Only finding was 2 uterine polyps which were removed.\u00a0\u00a0Pathology showed proliferative pattern endometrium, prolonged estrogen effect, stromal breakdown (which I think is normal for menstrual cycle), haven't talked to Dr. yet, but I work in the hospital dept. and I transcribed my own report.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. said uterus was anteverted 8 cm. Even tho it's not enlarged, could the anteverted uterus cause urinary incontinence with sneezing and coughing?\u00a0\u00a0I did not ask my Dr. this as I'm too embarrassed but I may ask when she calls with biopsy results. Also since I still have monthly periods, so no hormone imbalance, could I still have perimenopause symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0The ones I notice most are hot flashes, palpitations, forgetfulness.\u00a0\u00a0I also have a low back ache after lying in bed all night which gets better as I move about, and tingling in feet.\u00a0\u00a0X-rays show mild arthritis.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes and thyroid normal.\u00a0\u00a0Neurontin was no help.\u00a0\u00a0Antiarthritic no help so far.\u00a0\u00a0Could this aching in back and feet tingling be related at all to perimenopause?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
