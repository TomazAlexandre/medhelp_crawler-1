            "answer": "Cinnamon is not going to help you with blood sugars of 361...trust me! What time is it in relation to a meal? If it is 1-3 hours after a meal it sounds like you need to be on a bolus (fast-acting) insulin before your meals as well as the Lantus. That is generally the standard of care. I would make an appointment with your endo ASAP (regular doctors may not know how to work with basal/bolus insulin). In the meantime, do what you can to get your numbers down: reduce your carb intake as much as you possibly can (eat meat, fish, or other protein and fresh vegies, eliminate as much as possible starches). It is not recommended to exercise when you are that high. Drink a lot of water. If your numbers remain that high and you start to feel flu symptoms or to vomit, go to the ER.",
