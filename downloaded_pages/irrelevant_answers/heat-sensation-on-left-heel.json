            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Paresthesias or abnormal sensations can be due to diabetes, thyroid disorders, Lyme's or lupus should also be ruled out. The symptoms in your case could be due to spinal nerve compression in the lumbo-sacral region. This can occur due to spondylosis, narrowing of root canal, bulging disc, reduced disc space, tumors etc. A MRI of the region can help you diagnose this. This does not look like a vascular pathology. Please consult a neurologist for this. It can also be due to a vascular problem like deep vein thrombosis or a clot in deep veins. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
