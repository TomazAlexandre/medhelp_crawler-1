            "answer": "I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing so many health issues.\u00a0\u00a0I had MAJOR fatigue in January, to visit doctor after doctor, and really no diagnosis until, by a CT scan, found a thyroid nodule.\u00a0\u00a0I had my thyroid removed 7/1, and I can tell you that all my fatigue, depression, weight gain, muscle pain was attributed to the thyroid, even though my\u00a0\u00a0blood tests came back 'normal' my body was not producing enough thyroid hormone.\u00a0\u00a0I think that due to your hands and feet tingling you may have low calcium levels or diabetes, but I would also insist on having a thyroid scan and check your free T3 & T4 levels, along with having a Lyme antibody test done.\u00a0\u00a0I also tested positive for Lyme, which caused all the above symptoms, and the ones you're experiencing (the heart, the stomach, low blood pressure), and had to be on antibiotics, and got somewhat better, but I still was sick until my thyroidectomy.\u00a0\u00a0I felt like I couldn't go on, either,\u00a0\u00a0with worsening fatigue, and I'm a very positive person, so it was frightening to change so drastically and only be told by doctors 'they either didn't know' or 'you're depressed' and try to hand me a script for some type of pill that will make me feel worse.Keep pursuing the thyroid/Lyme issues.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you well, my friend!\u00a0\u00a0Please post after you've investigated the thyroid.HugsMargaret",
