            "answer": "I've never been a smoker either, but THIS is why I'm happy to live in Washington (believe me it's not because of the winter weather. LOL!), because you can't smoke in ANY building and supossed to be at least 25' from them if you are smoking! But this is all within the last couple years, prior to that I actually had to quit clubbing all together because of the \"smoke headaches\", so it may very well be the cause of how you're feeling today. Tomorrow you'll probably have a better idea as to what is going on, because it may very well be the Flu! good luck, and Congrats on your 6th day!",

    "question": "OK guys this is going to sound weird.I am a pretty healthy person as far as colds ect.I had an old friend in town for the weekend and took her out on the town Friday and Saterday night.I drank alittle both nights,but not enough to impair driving.Not to much at all.I havent been out like that in about 8 months,but we did have fun,I was ok Saterday when I woke up.But today,Oh my God.It feels like I got ran over by a truck.I feel like I am going through w/ds.I have been in the bath off and on all day and my nose and face hurt sooo bad.I also have no kind of energy what so ever.I am not out of pills so I know it is not w/ds.I am not a smoker so I am thinking that maybe I breathed in too much smoke.Or maybe its because Im just not used to going out or drinking at all.Like I said I have not went out or drank anything in 8 months or so.Or maybe I really am getting the flu???All I know is that lastnight I was fine and I woke up this morning and wwanted to die!!!!!I know this is off subject a little bit but does anyone have any thoughts???Thanks guys.By the way taper is going great.I am on day 6 and rockin it.Jennifer",
