    "question": "Hello,I am a 21 year old female.A couple of nights ago, I woke up around 5am to use the bathroom. I felt woozy, and all of a sudden got a very sharp pain in my stomach. I got very lightheaded and dizzy. It felt like I was having a seizure and next thing i remember is waking up on the ground next to the toilet, with a busted lip and the whole right side of my face bruised. Im not sure if its because of my gall bladder being removed, or possibly diabetes (for it runs in my family)",
