I also had the burning and pain in my legs for a while... only after treatment.I would definitely check with the doctor about the eye problem though. It could be something totally irrelevant to post interferon problems.Hope you find out what it is, or better, that it goes away!",

I definately think there are 'withdrawals' from these drugs.\u00a0\u00a0It may in fact be caused by our own immune systems coming back online as against the drugs leaving our systems.The one thing I can tell you is the further I get from EOT the better I feel!All the best to youEpi :)",

            "answer": "Well, thank you for the responses. The whole diabetes thing scares me to be honest. I'm not overweight or anything, haven't had any other symptoms to indicate diabetes, and ALSO, this was a concern of mine about half way through treatment, especially since I was on a medication that is notorious for causing diabetes...So I had bloodwork and everything was perfect. Of course, that was a good 6 months ago. If my glucose levels and all that were perfect 5 months into treatment, would it be possible for it to change that drastically like that? I'm hoping this is just general slight vision deterioration from the interferon. I did make an appointment with an opthamologist though.",

They immediately sent me to a the Ophthalmologist to have my eyes checked as Interferon can cause some serious eye problems namely cotton wool spots and retinal hemorrhages. My eyes checked out fine. I experienced it again late in treatment.I did notice during treatment and after that my vision has gotten worse. I had\u00a0\u00a020/15 vision my whole life. My eyes were beginning to slowly change with age (48), as I noticed my arms were becoming too short when reading the menu at restaurants LOL. Since beginning treatment and post my eyes have gotten progressively worse. I can not read anything without glasses anymore or perform any type of \"small delicate\" type things at work anymore with out my dollar store glasses. I do find it a bit disturbing. I can not say it is from treatment but it does seem very coincidental that so many of us notice similar effects.",

So I have both of them. Blurred vision and eye floaters. I feel that before I went on this treatment that something like this would happen to my eyes and so it did. I had to pray for God to help me. It was very bad. Please keep the sun light out of your eyes what ever you do. Take care, bye!",

    "question": "Ok, so as many of you know, I just finished treatment about a month ago. Well, within the last week or so, my vision has gotten significantly blurry. Now, I know the variety of eye problems this stuff can cause, and it was a concern of mine from day one. However, my vision was fine the entire time I was on treatment. Now all of a sudden, that rapidly changes. Is it possible that this could be some kind of withdrawal symptom? Since I'm now at a time when it's really starting to leave my body? I did get a weird burning-type ache in my legs for a few days about two weeks after my last dose, and the whole withdrawal thing came to my mind at that point as well, since I hadn't experienced that prior either. Is it even possible that it's related to the interferon if it has only now become an issue, weeks after my last dose? You guys have been such a huge help to me, and I thank you in advance.",
