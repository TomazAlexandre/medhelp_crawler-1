            "answer": "Hi!If there is no visible swelling then sprain and fracture are more or less ruled out. Instead the pain/pull/discomfort could be due to arthritis, gout, pseudo gout, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or carpel tunnel syndrome. If you are a diabetic or have a family history of diabetes, this should be checked as diabetes can cause stiff joints of hand.You can dip your hands in warm and cool water alternatively, exercise your wrist, and apply local analgesics. However, you must find the cause of your problem.This may not bother you so much now, but it is best to consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",

    "question": "I think the last 2 months I have actually strained my wrists but not the normal swelling. As when I carry food shopping only slightly heavy 2-3 bags I get a pull in the wrist area and can be sore. Even simple carrying a bag of milk and a bottle of sprite can set it off and in past weeks they have been really weak holding even a glass of water, toothbrush, Sometimes using a knife in left hand, opening milk etc. I have been wearing wrist brace and have some gel from doctors. Is there anything else I can do at home instead of bothering the doctor and if this sounds like a strain? Help would be great.Why are no results showing up if I'am uncomfortable?",
