            "answer": "Hi,Sorry for the delay, I have been away for a couple of days. I hope you get this as I really would appreciate your advice as you have a medical background.I am a female aged 24 years old (living in the UK) experiencing severe stomach pain. I also have other symptoms which include weight loss, passing urine frequently, burning on urination, I have a heavy vaginal discharge and notice that sometimes there will be a streak of blood in it. I feel very weak and tired all the time and can only eat small amounts of food at a time as the pain in my stomach gets worse after eating a meal. I was recently diagnosed with having H.Pylori and was given antibiotics for one week only. After finishing the course I went back to see my doctor as my symptoms still remain the same and because I feel really unwell. The doctor told me to wait a couple of weeks as the antibiotics are still in my system and that she will refer me for a ultrasound scan.If I am being honest I think I have had this H. Pylori for a long time because I have had these symptoms for a number of years. The pain in my stomach is both lower and upper and is constant. The pain gets sharper and more unbearable after eating a meal.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, I can only eat small amounts of food at a time.\u00a0\u00a0I read on the internet that if you have had H. Pylori for a long time it could cause cancer.The other symptoms include urinating frequently, stinging/burning on urination and I also have a heavy vaginal discharge and have noticed a streak of blood in it sometimes which I am very worried about. I had this discharge back in 2005 and it is now 2008. I was recently told that the results back in 2005 showed that I had an infection but I was never informed and was never treated for it. How much damage could this have caused?Having recently plucked up the courage to go to the doctors I had another swab. Results came back,there was an infection( Obviously, it has been there for 3 years ). Was given antibiotics for one week only but it has not cleared. I went back to my doctor who wants me to go for yet another swab to see if the same infection is still there and she has also referred me for an ultrasound scan which I have had recently and it came back normal. No other tests have been carried out. Another symptom is weight loss, over the past year I have gone from a size 12 to a size 6. If I am hungry I will eat, I am not anorexic. I am really concered for my health as I feel very weak and tired all the time and in constant pain in my stomach. Any ideas of what this could be?The only tests I have had are routine blood tests and an ultrasound scan which came back normal. Also, considering that my mother was diagnosed with extensive endometriosis there is a possibility that I could have it too.Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

            "answer": "H.PYLORIYou should have a BREATH test for H. pylori, made by gastroenterologist, when you'll body will be cleared of antibiotics (maybe a week after stopping any antibiotic, but you don't stop them without doctor approval). Blood test in your case won't be good since it shows previous infections also. Then you should have two week tripple therapy, which is by two antibiotics and an anti-acid drug by your doctor's choise. Antibiotics often have unpleasant side effects (mainly nausea), but try to overcome them and have a fool treatment course. It may help, if you avoid fatty food, spices, acidic foods (fruits, wine, alcohol, vinegar, vit C, aspirin, ibuprofen) and whatever irritates you.H. pylori causes inflammation of stomach, gastric or duodenal ulcer or cancer. These may be considered as three stages of this chronic infection. In your case, ulcer is possible. This can be diagnosed only by esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy, which is usually preceded by X-ray with barium swallow.After antibiotics for H. pylori, you'll still probably need anti-acid drugs for some time. If symptoms won't improve considerably, you'll need endoscopy and biopsy to find out is it ulcer or cancer.FREQUENT URINATING / VAGINAL DISCHARGEFirst thought is an infection. You should insist to have an urine culture and vaginal swabs, antibiotic susceptibility test, and antibiotic treatment according to lab results, and not just \"usual\" antibiotics, which are prescribed in urinary infection without testing.If also an AMOUNT of urine is increased, it may be diabetes. Candida infection (urinary and vaginal) commonly accompany it. If you think, it could be diabetes, have a blood glucose checked.You have to cure these infections, and then see if any symptoms will persist, and then think from there. Endometriosis would also be possible, but first you need to cure infections.",
