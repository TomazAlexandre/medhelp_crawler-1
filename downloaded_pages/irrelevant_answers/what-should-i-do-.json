Maybe you should eat more but try to stay within your calorie intake being that you have gestational diabetes. I feel bad for you because I just failed my 1hr glucose test but passed the 3hr one.

    "question": "I'm 31+3 weeks pregnant, I went to the midwives at exactly 30 weeks pregnant. My midwife basically told me I have protein in my urine but my blood pressure is fine she also told me to ring the hospital if I get bad head aches ect.Since then I've been waking up to head aches, they're not bad but sometimes can be sharp at the back of my head I also get pins and needles and numbness in my left hand.. Is this a sign I'm developing pre-eclampsia?Just to add I'm on hight dependency and I have Gestational diabetes.",
