            "answer": "Under no circumstances should you be under the \"care\" of a non-MD, non-physician optometrist (had a O.D. degree after his name).

Specifically with this problem I would suggest a Eye MD specializing in retina disease.\u00a0\u00a0Find one at www.aao.orgThis is a very serious problem and the first thing is to find out what caused the bleeding. The most common things would be: diabetic proliferative retinopathy, retinal tear, retinal detachment, blockage of the main veins in the eye.This is VERY important.JCH III MD",
