Im taking 100mg a day of iron with orange juice for the absorption.\u00a0\u00a0I stopped taking prenantals. But eating foods that supply a lot of nutrients. Iron can be hard on the stomach but depending on the dosage and such you can always take half in the morning and half a night.",

    "question": "So far im taking a prenatal supplement that has iron, an iron supplement, vitamin c to help absorb iron, and now im prescribed glyburide to help regulate my fasting blood sugars with gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I was only slightly anemic and to take soo much iron to supplement? seems excessive epecially when ive read about a link to iron supplementation with high blood sugars and increases risk for type two diabetes. Vitamin c has side effects of its own including nausea which I now experience again at 28 weeks due to vitamin c supplement. I had a yeast infection which hadnt been bothering me for a couole days now and doc still says to use monistat which itches burns and causes cramping when I wasnt even that uncomfortable and I felt like my body was dealing with it. And now I understand the use of meds because fasting blood sugars are high but there arent any other methods I could try before taking a med with its side effects. One of which is heart disease which is also side effect of iron and vitamin c? I wanted this pregnancy to be natural and full of life but beginning to feel overmedicated\u00a0\u00a0and depressed :(",
