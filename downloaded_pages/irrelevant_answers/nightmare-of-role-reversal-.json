            "answer": "My heart breaks for you. I can \"feel\" your pain, and I am so sorry. I hope your husband will start to get better, with changing the meds. I am glad you called the ambulance, sounds like he needed to be seen and quick.My mother was in the same \"boat\" as you. My dad was her primary caregiver and my siblings and I often thought, that we hoped nothing would ever happen to my dad. Didn't know what my mom would do, although there are 3 of us and we would all help out. I know my mom also thought this pretty often, and it was really difficult for her. Lots and lots of stress with those circumstances.I don't have to much to add, just wanted you to know that I am thinking of you and wishing you well.Warmly,Michelle",

            "answer": "My heart really goes out to you too, I also had a very bad reaction to Statins but I realised it sooner. However, I had the same experience with Tagamet for an undx stomach ulcer (same year I first had ON) it turned out to be IBS that was some 20 years ago. I was very poorly too and the medics feared for my liver and kidneys. I made a full recovery but it took some time, I suffered a lot of pain too.There is a forum of medics on the web who are fighting against the trend to perscribe stains to everyone. After my bad experience with them I read Dr. Malcolm Kendricks book The Great Cholestrol Con. It is a very scary book about drug company profits, ghost writing of medical papersand funding of reserch.\u00a0\u00a0I won't go into details just google both of the above.Statins are one of my pet hates they cause more than they cure (you might have noticed). Just take care of yourself for now too, you need to preserve your strength too. You must be angry at the medics also but it's not worth the energy!Sending cyber hugs across the sea I really feel for you.LovePatx",

            "answer": "Your story is not boring! How dare you say that! You are reaching out with your story and your husbands' story in the hope it can help others who read it. And also for support, both emotional and for help. All of the above posts have excellent suggestions. We know health agencies are overwhelmed right now with all the suffering both physical, emotional, and mental due to the economy. When my mom was sick in the hospital, the hospital social person helped set my dad up with meals-on-wheels, and even offered to find rides to the store to shop or the hospital so he could visit. They are a wonderful resource. M-O-W will also deliver after your husband comes home, for both of you. A lot of Senior Centers have a van or bus that will pick you up at your house and take you where you need to go. Shopping, dr, to the hospital. And usually very low cost or free. I know you are exhausted right now, but when you are rested, please look into these resources.Isn't it amazing that when someone who has never been sick gets sick, they suddenly are the \"sickest person in the world\" and need more waiting on and hand holding, than someone who has been sick before or continually with a chronic disease. Being a person with chronic conditions, I know I try not to ask for much help, if I can possible do it myself. Having had one once myself, I know husbands can be big babies, LOL.hugs & prayersMaggie",

            "answer": "Hi, Marcie. So many here can identify with you (which has to be the whole point of health forums anyway!).Lots of times the people who are supposed to be the most knowledgeable are also those most in denial. A doctor I otherwise admire a lot absolutely neglected his own health and never got check-ups, though he would not admit that to most people. He wouldn't exercise and put on quite a lot of weight, despite his own father's problems with heart disease. And this is one of the brightest folks I know. He's okay, but not great, at the moment.There comes the time in most of our lives where role-reversal takes place. This is often with our parents\u00a0\u00a0but can be with anyone close. It can be hard to take over the reins, but take over we must. Just be firm with your husband, and follow your own good instincts no matter what he says. The only good part of this for you is that it happened when it was still quite treatable, and from now on you're in charge.Hang in there.ess",

Not sure what that is about - he is still not very communicative and said he had a bad day today.\u00a0\u00a0This will be 5th day in hospital.Bit worried about infection and him coming home.

    "question": "Up until now my husband who is now retired has been the person that empties the trash, changes lightbulbs, gets me coffee in the morning (actually afternoon) when I get up -\u00a0\u00a0just to get me going.\u00a0\u00a0I use a walker or electric chair half of the time I am up.\u00a0\u00a0He doesn't always do it with good grace, but he does it.\u00a0\u00a0 You just have to be careful what you say!\u00a0\u00a0At one time I had a small tantrum and said \"you're lucky it doesn't happen to you because then you would know what it feels like to be helpless and depend on someone else\"....\u00a0\u00a0 Well, someone heard me apparently although I would not wish anything on anyone else, believe me.To clue you in, 5 weeks ago he was dxed with diabetes Type 12 and has to do his blood sugar 2X daily and follow a different diet from the one that got him to this point.\u00a0\u00a0Needless to say, I might as well have been dxed with diabetes on top of my MS because I'm the one who tests him, records it and makes his meals (nothing fancy).Anyhow, 10 days ago he said he had a pain in his left leg and needed to lay on the couch, not the lazyboy, as it hurt to get up.\u00a0\u00a0He stayed on the couch day and night (no kidding) for the next 10 days getting up only to go to the bathroom using MY walker.\u00a0\u00a0 He got weaker and weaker and could not even sit up or push himself up on the couch. It was heartbreaking to see him go downhill in 10 days.\u00a0\u00a0I was in tears.\u00a0\u00a0He is normally very strong and I couldn't think what it could be. Never been sick or in the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0I could not lift him although I tried. I wanted to call 911 but he dared me not to do it with looks that could kill and said he wouldn't go even if I called..\u00a0\u00a0He kept saying wait until tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0I was\u00a0\u00a0testing his blood, bringing him food but he was eating very little, drinks, water,\u00a0\u00a0meds, clean clothes - in fact\u00a0\u00a0I never stopped and I felt so ill and hurt all over but this was my love who was now hurting and sick and I had nobody to turn to so I had to do it.\u00a0\u00a0 I don't know where I got the strength really, but it just goes to show that the old adrenalin was pumping. I was also very frightened to think if it was permanent or a downhill thing then that was really the end for both of us\u00a0\u00a0as far as living on our own.\u00a0\u00a0Stress and tiredness\u00a0\u00a0is not the word. I just collapsed in bed, couldn't sleep in case he needed something and dreaded getting up,\u00a0\u00a0getting to the kitchen holding onto walls so I could go through it all again.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't been able to sleep, eat or think properly. Finally I had had enough, he wasn't getting any better so I called his doctor who said \"no ifs ands or buts and no negotiations\" he was to go in the ambulance to the hosital and he actually called the ambulance which let me off the hook.He is in the hospital right now after being 9 hours on a guerney before getting a bed (welcome to my world).After tests etc. yesterday they ruled out dvt or stroke.\u00a0\u00a0The hospital doctor says he can't believe how weak his muscles are and how shaky he is but he is almost 100% positive it is the statins he is taking. He called our doctor and said they needed to change everything.\u00a0\u00a0They took him off all his meds and said this is definitely not the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He had been taking Benicar for bp, Lipitor (statin) for cholesterol, Januvet for diabetes and had just\u00a0\u00a0added Niaspan, another statin.\u00a0\u00a0Apparently statins can cause all these symptoms and also can harm your liver and kidneys..\u00a0\u00a0I looked up side effects of statins and was horrified by peoples' experiences.\u00a0\u00a0I keep asking myself why didn't my husband realize this?\u00a0\u00a0He is a (retired) pharnacist.\u00a0\u00a0Between him and the doctor I don't know who is worse.This has really made me realize how vulnerable I am and how little I can do.\u00a0\u00a0I feel trapped really.\u00a0\u00a0For the first time in 3 years\u00a0\u00a0I walked down the driveway scared to death at 4:30 in the morning so nobody would see me, with the walker of course (and very, very slowly) to get the mail and the paper.\u00a0\u00a0I even tied the garbage to the walker and left it at the curb.\u00a0\u00a0Couldn't figure out how to get the garbage can down there. So while he is in the hospital, that is my plan.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My neighbor got us some bread, milk and eggs and then left on vacation for the week. I don't drive any more so this will have to do until next weekend. But where there's a will there's a way I guess.\u00a0\u00a0This all made me think of grannyhotwheels and her husband being sick\u00a0\u00a0- you just get through it somehow.You can tell I am\u00a0\u00a0sleep deprived by this long post..Sorry If it is boring but it has helped me get my thoughts together :)Marcie",
