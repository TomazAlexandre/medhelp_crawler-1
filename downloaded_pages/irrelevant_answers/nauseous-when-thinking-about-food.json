I had a stomach virus! If you are vomiting or diarrhea is happening then you may have a virus, if not, you may have an eating disorder. I wish you luck and hope you feel better!\u00a0\u00a0ask a doctor for help! it may be serious",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you are a 15 year old girl and have a history of missed periods and unprotected sex, then this nausea could be due to pregnancy. Other than this commonest cause of chronic nausea is acidity. Take omeprazole (empty stomach in morning) and antacid gel and see if it helps. Liver and kidney dysfunction is another cause. Hence kidney and liver function tests should be done. Other causes are diabetes and hypothyroidism. Electrolyte imbalance too can cause nausea. IBS, gluten or lactose intolerance, parasites in gut too can be the cause. A stool test should be done for worms, giardiasis etc. Also if nothing is found then food challenge test to detect food intolerance should be done.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "For about a month now I have been feeling very strange. I am definitely a person who loves to eat, but recently even the thought of food makes me want to gag. No matter how hungry I am, I just cannot force myself to eat, and\u00a0\u00a0when I finally do, it takes all the strength in the world to keep it down and the nauseous feelings don't go away for hours. I have no idea what to do. I am only 15 years old, my mother is convinced there's nothing wrong with me, but I definitely know something is not right, see as I love food. I'm not on any pills or medication so it's not a side effect. Is this a mental problem? Or do I have some sort of virus?",
