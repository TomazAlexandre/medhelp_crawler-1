            "answer": "I hear you girl! My daughter is 4 and I was induced with her because the labor wasn't progressing fast enough. She came out 8 pounds 14 ounces. It worries me no matter what because either they won't induce and he will get huge and I would possibly need c-section or if they do induce I know it is super painful and intense. I don't want him here too early but I also don't want a baby that is too large and not healthy..",

    "question": "Had doctor visit yesterday and my doctor said she would like a dating ultrasound done because he's measuring big. Went in for the ultrasound and was told he's 17 days ahead of edd. So suppose to be 29 weeks and she said measuring at 31 weeks and 5 days. She also informed me he is 4 pounds. Just wondering if anyone can relate or have any thoughts? Won't see my doctor for another two weeks..",
