            "answer": "Hi,these constant high numbers are not normal and your husband has very high risk of severe complications and damage to his body.Target 'normal' numbers even for a diabetic are < 140 (with a range of about 80 - 140).Your doctor is doing him a grave disservice by not managing him properly.\u00a0\u00a0If he cannot get his numbers down with diet, exercise and his current meds he may need to be on insulin or a different medicine.I strongly recommend he find another doctor who would be willing and able to treat him properly.",

            "answer": "I absolutely agree with Sally and I don't think your husband should wait, as the more time spent at these high numbers the more likely diabetic complications.My question is, is your husband Type 1 or Type 2? I'm not sure what you mean by a pancreatic attack; was he in DKA when he was first diagnosed? This is much more common with Type 1's than Type 2's. (though not unheard of). You also don't say if he had good numbers for awhile but then it started creeping up. If this is happening at 2 years in, there is a chance he was misdiagnosed as Type 2 (I was) and is in fact Type 1 or LADA/1.5. I strongly encourage you to see that endo. You can't afford NOT to pay for the gas. (not meaning to be unsympathetic, money is hard, diabetic complications are a lot harder.)",

            "answer": "Hi Sally,Thanks for your post.\u00a0\u00a0Even tho my husband has been diagnosed for going on 3 years, we still don't know too much about this.One thing I forgot to mention is that he is already on insulin and has been since diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0He takes 30 to 40 units of Lantus every night.I can't tell you how much nagging (and every other type of method available) I've done to get him to eat right.\u00a0\u00a0He is under a lot of anxiety, stress and depression right now (finances!) and has gotten into a routine of not getting up until 10am, drink coffee and watch TV and MAYBE move around a little bit during the day and then have his first meal somewhere between 2 and 4pm.\u00a0\u00a0I finally got him to eat some fruit, but he's like a little boy trying to eat vegetables!\u00a0\u00a0Some he likes, but he just doesn't have a very good diet at all!The exercising is only done when he needs to walk into a store or bank, etc, after driving there.I'm at my wits ends trying to get him to change.\u00a0\u00a0He understands the seriousness of it all, but just doesn't have the ambition to follow thru.I think my next step is to get him set up with that endo again.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again.",

            "answer": "Hi Zoe ~As far as him being type I or type II, we've never been told anything but type II and from what I've researched, type I is when you get it at a young age.\u00a0\u00a0Is that wrong?\u00a0\u00a0My husband was 49 when diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0And I've definitely never heard anything, or read anything about LADA/1.5.His high numbers have always been the case.\u00a0\u00a0I can think of only two times he went down to 60 and we had the quick fix sugar pill and it worked fast. And his doctor knows this. (quack quack)\u00a0\u00a0But ~~~ so has my husband - so who is worse? the Doc or my husband?His pancreatic attack, well, his triglycerides were at 5,000.\u00a0\u00a0These, I believe are normal at 35 to 160 or so.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor even told us he made a new Nevada State record. (we were visiting Reno when all this happened on our weekend trip).I'm looking at 2 of his ACL test results.\u00a0\u00a0The one dated 7/9/09 show his triglyceride at 446 and the ALC at 7.3,\u00a0\u00a0Then on 12/22/09 the tri's\u00a0\u00a0had jumped to 969 and the ALC was at 8.8.\u00a0\u00a0Well, without knowing what all this means, all I can tell is that EVERYTHING is HIGH. He went this morning for another blood test and we will know Thursday, 2/25.I don't know what you mean by DNK.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure, either, what a pancreatic attack is, but thats what they told us. We've never had anyone suggest it has anything to do with cancer of the pancreas, but I can sure tell you it's painful.\u00a0\u00a0(the only time I would agree with my husband that a man-pain is worse than a woman's labor pain)I've got him on Splenda and absolutely no sugar (I don't even buy it anymore) occasional fresh fruit, only peas and broccoli for green vegetables, I try my best to send him out on errands to town so he gets up and has to walk even a little.\u00a0\u00a0I'm lecturing all the time about him needing to follow the rules.\u00a0\u00a0I'm also trying to wear him down about going back to that endo.\u00a0\u00a0I am doing the best I can, but to tell ya, I'm totally disabled myself, I can barely walk, along with the anxiety, stress, depression, problems resulting from 3 back surgeries and even a brain surgery.\u00a0\u00a0 I have his mom getting on him, both his daughters getting on him....I just don't know what else to do.\u00a0\u00a0I make him read anything I see on line (such as these two comments)\u00a0\u00a0I can't stand for very long, so he's always done the cooking.\u00a0\u00a0He's an excellent cook, too, but if I request green beans, I see them on my plate but not his.\u00a0\u00a0I've even gone as far as to do what I did with my boys when they were little ~ they had to take one bite a year of something they hated. Thats all, once a year. And, eventually both of them ended up liking most of those previously 'icky' food.He got a sore on a toe hang nail yesterday and it looked infected and I got the opportunity to get him so freaked out he made it to that blood test finally and made a doctor appt. the next day.\u00a0\u00a0He's already gone thru a sore on his arm that a dermatologist gave him ointment for.Your statement that 'money is hard, diabetic complications are a lot harder' got a rise from him. Even an 'mmmmm' in a deep thinking way.Thanks again for your replyKarri",

            "answer": "Everything you state, Karri, Makes that endo seem more and more necessary. Three years and his numbers have always been high??? He is at serious risk for diabetic complications. I can't believe his doctor would accept this. Lantus is a basal insulin and needed for background, but if your husband is high (which it sounds like he is) two hours after eating, he also needs bolus shots, to cover his food. A basal/bolus regimen is standard. As for Type, I was misdiagnosed as Type 2 at age 58. I'm LADA which for all intents and purposes is Type 1. It is not only for children. I'm not saying that is your husband's case. He definitely needs to see that endo ASAP and get on a treatment that will work.",

            "answer": "My husband does have a different insulin he is SUPPOSE to be using - it's called HUMALOG.\u00a0\u00a0He only used it for a short while so we have this vile sitting in the fridge.Of course, his test results today showed levels going down.\u00a0\u00a0Today his Triglyceride came in at 376.\u00a0\u00a0Remember, July is was 446, then December it jumped to 969. Well, today its 376.His July A1C was 7.3, jumped to 8.8 in December and today was 8.1.This is just so confusing!\u00a0\u00a0I AM talking more and more about going to the endo and I think I'm actually seeing him thinking it over.\u00a0\u00a0I really think that sore on his toe may have been the turning point. Even tho the doctor told him the cure I told him to use (Tea Tree Oil) was the best option and his toe looks so much better.But, funny as it goes, back in 1999 I went to our doctor for an ingrown toenail, he asked me how long it had been since I had my last seizure and I said mid-1980's ( but I'd only a a few in my life ), he requested me to get an MRI.\u00a0\u00a0This scan detected an AVM (something similar to an aneurysm).\u00a0\u00a0If I hadn't gone in for an ingrown toe nail, he said I could have walked out of his office and keeled over from it bursting.\u00a0\u00a0I had my brain surgery 6 months later. And now my husband's toe may be the turning stone for him to finally take this diabetes seriously.",

Pancreatitis is often a trigger for development of diabetes mellitus. Right now, the fact is that you husban is a patient of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Please get his HbA1C done from a pathology lab and let me know. I also need his current fasting and post prandial blood sugar.

    "question": "What would cause my husband's blood sugar levels to always be high?\u00a0\u00a0We discovered he was diabetic 2 1/2 years ago when he had a very, very severe pancreatic attack.\u00a0\u00a0Taken by ambulance to the hospital and stayed in ER for about 8 hours.\u00a0\u00a0When we returned home, it was only 20 minutes before we were in the car rushing to the hospital again.\u00a0\u00a0This time they kept him for 2 weeks.Ok, thats the history.\u00a0\u00a0Now I would like to know about these high numbers.\u00a0\u00a0He has even gotten as high as almost hitting 400.\u00a0\u00a0His average is 220 to 320.\u00a0\u00a0It's been a long time since he had too low of numbers and that only happened a few times.\u00a0\u00a0He takes metformin and tricor for the diabetes, as well as several other medications such as methadone (for pain), vicodin (only occationally) and ativan for anxiety.He gets blood tests about every 4 months, but the doctor doesn't seem to care very much to resolve this.\u00a0\u00a0He only goes to our family doctor because the specialist is an hour away and we just can't afford the gas.Are these constant high numbers dangerous, or could they be 'his normal'?",
