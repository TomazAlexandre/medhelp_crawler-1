I am suffering from this problem since 9 years. No cause is found. General statement from doctor would be ' this may be due to trapped nerve'.***** B12 level. If they are low, take injection of B12 in parental form.Oral will not have any effect. IN short, pursue related specialists. If you are lucky, you may find the diagnosis.

    "question": "Hi,\u00a0\u00a0I am a 35 year old male, a few months ago I started to get a tingle/ tickle in both arms and legs all day everyday.\u00a0\u00a0I used to experience this feeling sometimes in my legs at night before going to sleep but that was all, now I have this in all 4 limbs and it is very uncomfortable and frustrating.\u00a0\u00a0I have had an ECG and a brain scan for separate reasons and these are all normal apart from slight high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0What I have read is that this could be restless leg syndrome or a trapped nerve, so any advice would be appreciated.Steven",
