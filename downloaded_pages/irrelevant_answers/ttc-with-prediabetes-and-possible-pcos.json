            "answer": "Congratulations, you appear to be well on your way to being normal, nondiabetic. Continue with the weight loss, increase walking to moderate, and continue with the diabetic diet. Next doctor visit ask for an A1c [HgbA1c, HgA1c] test. You can Google A1c for an explanation why it is considered the standard test for determining diabetes. Lastly, do you have a home glucose test meter? If not, ask your doctor for one. Read other threads on this forum for testing times and appropriate levels. Good luck.",
