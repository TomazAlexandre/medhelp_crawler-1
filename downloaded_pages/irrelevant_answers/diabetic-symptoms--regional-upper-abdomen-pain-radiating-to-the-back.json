            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.I am glad that you have made an appointment with your doctor. It is important to listen to your body. You know your body best and are the best gauge of something not being right. Make sure that you describe all of your symptoms to your doctor, and your concerns. For some people, a trip to the doctor can cause them to become nervous. Sometimes they forget to ask some of their most pressing questions while in the office. It can help to write down your questions so that you make sure that you get to everything.I wish that I could give you some clarity about your symptoms/pain. Unfortunately, in order to properly diagnose any condition you would need to be physically examined and appropriate tests run. I am glad that you will see your doctor this week. Good luck, and I hope you are feeling better.Cathy",

    "question": "Hello I'm new here. When I'm in a panic, I get really wordy and I then to ramble on, so bear with me, please. I'll keep it short.Years of drinking fizzy drinks, sometimes downing 2 litre bottled drinks in one sitting have finally caught up with me. I've had symptoms that indicate that I may have had diabetes. I've been in a state of denial about it for years. I've long suspected, but life's issues push these thoughts out.Over the winter, symptoms have become more serve than ever before. It came about all so suddenly. Symptoms ranging from a dull ache around the upper abdomen region to very sharp tingling pain sensations around my hands and feet with very dry eyes. This usually happens after meals with no sugar content or even a quick snack rich in sugars. I get really tired a lot and fall to sleep during the day. I only pass a lot of urine after drinking a lot of water. Now it\u2019s just the case of me eating the smallest things that'll set things off. I'm just wondering is this usual with diabetes?For some reason, I really don't think it is \"normal\", but I'm no expert. The one thing I'm really, really concerned about is whether it could be Pancreatic Cancer. So little about it is known and symptoms only develop only when it\u2019s in its advanced stage.I've read somewhere that one of the symptoms of Pancreatic Cancer is a dull ache around the upper abdomen. The other week, I've had pain in that region that was radiating from the front to my back accompanied with shoulder pain. Now I just wake up to a dull ache.The weekend is over and now I can book an appointment with my GP and finally get myself checked out. I'm most likely to see him at the end of the week so right now it'll be sleepless nights until I get some sort of definitive answer and even then I have a feeling I won't get anything definitive until I get the test done.Well you know that's not good enough for me. I need something definitive now and that why I'm here. What is your opinion?",
