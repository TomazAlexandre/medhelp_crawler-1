            "answer": "I hope the B12 caps make a difference, but even if you do happen to have a B12 deficiency, usually you need to be on B12 shots and B12 caplets don't usually do the trick.\u00a0\u00a0It depends on what the B12 deficiency is due to.\u00a0\u00a0I was mildly B12 deficient and started the caps and they worked well fairly quickly for me (probably in a few months' time), but I eat a mostly vegan diet--so I was getting very little B12 in my diet.\u00a0\u00a0But most people who are B12 deficient DO get enough B12 in their diet and have something called pernicious anemia and need to get injections (not saying you have this-I have no idea-just explaining the difference).\u00a0\u00a0The way to find out if you are even deficient is to get a B12 blood test done.\u00a0\u00a0It might not even be this.",

    "question": "I started having tingling sensation in my left hand about two weeks ago, followed by the right hand and then my left foot.\u00a0\u00a0At first I thought it was due to degenerative disk disease in my neck, but that would not account for my foot.\u00a0\u00a0Then the tingling changed to almost a burning sensation whenever I touch something.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My left foot is starting to exhibit the same signs.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure that this is a neurological condition since I saw somewhere that the burning sensation could be attributed to Diabetes Type II.\u00a0\u00a0Is there any relief (short and long term)?\u00a0\u00a0How can I narrow this down?\u00a0\u00a0I'm seeing a neurologist in a week, but would like to know more if someone has any info.",
