            "answer": "Some women with PCOS are not overweight, but most are. Also, some do ovulate. PCOS can occur later in life. You may also have another type of hormonal imbalance, or be peri-menopausal (although you seem too young for that). Pcos is usually treated with birth control pills, and metformin. I suggest having a complete female hormone panel of bloodwork done as your starting point. Good luck, and post if you get any answers.",
