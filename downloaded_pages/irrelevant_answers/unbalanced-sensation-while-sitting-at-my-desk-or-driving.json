            "answer": "Hello dear and welcome to the medhelp forum. These symptoms could be due to vertigo. There are causes like inner ear involvement, meniere\u2019s disease or commonly due to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Did you have any injury to the head? This sensation could also be associated with migraines if you have headaches. TIA or transient ischemic attacks need to be ruled out since these could cause transient loss of consciousness and may be a forerunner of stroke. You need to check with an ophthalmologist for evaluation of macular function since any edema; holes or degeneration can cause visual distortion. This may be seen in diabetes, post cataract surgery if you had any. These are some speculations, you consult a physician who can assess and direct you to the right specialist doctor. Best wishes.",

            "answer": "Hello dear, thanks for the query. Anxieties can affect any perception depending on the degree that you have been stressed up. Since you say you have blocked sinuses and allergies, any upper respiratory tract infection in the throat, nose or sinuses can affect the middle ear via the Eustachian tube. Fluid in the middle ear can cause dizziness symptoms due to adjoining inner ear. You need to keep your sinuses dry and clear by steam inhalation, decongestants, and blowing out the secretions. An antibiotic is needed if the secretions are infected. Consult an otolaryngologist and a physician for your symptoms. Best wishes.",

    "question": "Hi - I was hoping that someone could help me out. About a week ago I was in a meeting at work and I experienced what I would call a mini panic attack. The room got smaller and the people in front of me seemed to be somewhat elevated. Since then, everytime I set at my desk or drive I get the sensation that things appear narrow or that I'm looking up at them. More of unbalanced feeling. It's hard to describe but I'm hoping someone can help me out before I go see a litney of doctors.",
