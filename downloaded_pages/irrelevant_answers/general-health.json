            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Usually lymphnodes in occipital area swell due to local infection like dandruff, eczema, dermatitis etc. The commonest cause of feeling cold is low external temperature. There can be several other causes like hypothyroidism, liver diseases, low Vit B12, adrenal insufficiency, liver failure and as a side effect of some drugs. Chills are also felt when a fever is about to start in case of malaria and bacterial infections due to release of toxins. One can also feel chilled if you are about to break into viral fever. Vit B12 deficiency causes feeling cold, tiredness, dizziness etc. Low intrinsic factor in gut that hampers absorption, pernicious anemia, parasites in the gut, diet poor in Vit B12, Crohn;s disease, IBS, or poor metabolism by liver are the causes behind it. The hands could be cold due to reduced blood supply as in diabetes, carpal tunnel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, poor sleep, smoking, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon and pinched cervical spinal nerve.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
