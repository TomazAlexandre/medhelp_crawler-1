            "answer": "Hi !\u00a0\u00a0I can tell you that John F. Kennedy had addison's disease and I've read that he had been suffering symptoms years before he was diagnosed. It is true that if your mother gets ill or suffers from severe stress... than she could have an adrenal crisis.I don't know what to tell you... other than you may want to call her physician and let him know.Good luck !!!!",

            "answer": "I agree. What can you do? Two of my sons have diabetes, since 98. I had perfect control over their diabetes when they were little, now they are 15 abd 16 and I can beg and plead with them to do what they need to do. I stay on them 24/7!!! BUT...what it boils down to, I cant watch them 24/7. They go to school and they travel constantly playing sports so i cant watch them!!! It does break my heart, but at the end of the day I cant make them eat right unless I am with them which isnt very much. Your Mom, she is going to do what she wants...Enjoy your boys and just pray for her to wake up and take care of herself. You dont need to obsess over it, you have enough going on with children and being busy! You can be concerned and pray! I have 4 boys and 2 girls.",

            "answer": "Hi.....I was diagnosed with Addisons disease in 1976......it took quite some time before we came to the correct diagnosis..........and I can emphatically say..........noone simply recovers from Addisons disease..........the adrenals stop working properly........and they just don't star up again when they feel better.............I'm guessing that if your Mom hasn't taken her hydrocortisone as she's said she hasn't........she was misdiagnosed in the first place...........or........she certainly wouldn't be feeling very well.........or would be worse.......as in dead ! My very best to you in handling your Mom........she sounds like a handful.................peace and love.......Norma",
