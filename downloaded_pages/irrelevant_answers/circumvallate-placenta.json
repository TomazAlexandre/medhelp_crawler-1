Her doctors are monitoring her very closely just to make sure. In other words don't take it lightly,\u00a0\u00a0ask your doctors questions and get answers. I hope this help....Good-luck with the pregnancy.",

    "question": "Does anyone know anything about Circumvallate Placenta?\u00a0\u00a0My 18w u/s showed that my placenta was circumvallate and I'm not finding a lot online to tell me about it.\u00a0\u00a0All I can find out is that the ends of the placenta are curled up some which leaves less attached to the uterine wall which can cause less nutrients to get to the baby and can cause intrauterine growth restriction.\u00a0\u00a0I also find that it can lead to placental abruption if any bleeding occurs.\u00a0\u00a0I'm being seen now my a perinatologist in addtion to my high risk OB due to gestational diabetes and AMA, but now this adds even more to my risks.\u00a0\u00a0The perinatologist didn't seem overly concerned when he mentioned it to me, but said we would monitor during my u/s (monthly).\u00a0\u00a0They did not get all the heart shots they wanted on u/s because baby would not stay still long enough to get them....wondering if that would give any indication of issues from the placenta also.I go back to my regular OB tomorrow and will discuss with him but thought I'd see if anyone here has any knowledge of the issue......thanks!",
