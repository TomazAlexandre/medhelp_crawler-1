            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Since you are not able to tolerate temperature fluctuations the first things to be ruled out are thyroid disorders (both hypo and hyper), adrenal gland problems, anemia, diabetes, hypoglycemia, liver diseases, low Vit B12, and vasovagal attacks.You will need simple blood tests to rule out most of these, a blood sugar and blood pressure monitoring at the time of 'attack', and maybe a tilt table test.There are many other causes of dizziness but they do not occur with temperature fluctuations like cervical spondylitis, high blood pressure, TMJ, acidity etc.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",
