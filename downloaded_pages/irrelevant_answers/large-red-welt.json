            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, cellulitis or infection under the skin is one possibility. This can be dangerous as it can spread. It is more common in people with diabetes. The other possibility is a swollen lymph node\u2014there are lymphnodes behind the ear\u2014or it could be hair root infection.You need to consult a doctor who can examine you, as soon as possible. You will probably need a course of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents.Other than this it can be a localized patch of dermatitis or eczema. A skin specialist can help you with this. Take care!",

            "answer": "Hi Kaitlin,I had the same thing....infection behind my ear, swollen, red, painful lump. I went to the doctor and they lanced it and put me on antibiotics. I still get them every so often, but not as bad.\u00a0\u00a0Once on antibiotics, a warm compress might help bring the infection to the surface if the doctor feels it isn't \"ripe\" enough for lancing. Keep the area dry...I used a little bit of rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball to keep mine clean and dry, dabbing several times a day.\u00a0\u00a0Sleeping on the opposite side will help, also...eliminating the pressure and allowing the area to \"air\".Good luck! I know those things hurt alot\u00a0\u00a0:(Weffette",
