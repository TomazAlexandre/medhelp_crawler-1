            "answer": "Thank you for the advice. I just saw an ENT today and he said that my ears and sinuses are fine. He reviewed my blood work and clarified that only my eosinophil count is high. He said that my symptoms are possibly due to allergies, so he recommended trying an over-the-counter antihistamine. I'm going to try that, but is it possible that my symptoms are due to a parasite infection? I haven't kept track on paper, but my symptoms seems to be somewhat cyclical, increasing in severity every few weeks.",

    "question": "I am an active, twenty-year-old female with a healthy diet and low blood pressure. This past fall I began experiencing tingling in my arms and legs, and my hands began going numb and changing colors in response to cold temperatures. I didn\u2019t see a doctor at that time because the tingling sensations were more a nuisance than a major disruption and I also was fairly convinced that I had Raynaud\u2019s.However, in May I began experiencing dizziness and fatigue, which prompted me to see a doctor at a walk-in clinic. I had experienced other periods of dizziness and fatigue over the past few years, but never as severe. A number of blood tests were done to rule out an auto-immune disorder, thyroid problems, diabetes, and anemia. The results were normal. After a few bad weeks which included feeling lightheaded, vertigo, fatigue, tingling, and eye/jaw pain, I began to feel better. However, a month later the fatigue and dizziness returned and the symptoms have continued to come and go since that time.I recently saw a new doctor who performed more blood tests and who ordered an MRI. The only abnormal thing with my blood work was an elevated white blood cell count. (I should mention that my sinuses/ears/throat have been bothering me recently, so it\u2019s possible that the elevated WBC is unrelated to my other symptoms.) The MRI was performed this morning and the results were normal. My doctor recommended seeing both a hematologist and a neurologist, but I am still feeling a bit lost about the best course to take at this point. Prior to my MRI I was really worried that I would be diagnosed with MS, but since that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case, could I possibly be experiencing some sort of allergic reaction rather than a neurological problem? I forgot to mention to my doctor that I tend to wake up with swollen cheeks. (That has been happening for a couple years, so I haven\u2019t been associating it with my other symptoms.)This probably isn\u2019t relevant, but just in case I want to note that my mom was diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s at 31 and she later passed away from Breast Cancer. Luckily she is the only one in my close family with a history of cancer.Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
