            "answer": "Dear MomNancy,Thank you for reaching out to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. I am not a doctor and am not qualified to give you medical advice. However I can give you my own personal experience.A blood sugar of 156 is outside the guidelines for someone without diabetes. It can depend on when you tested her and the last time she had had a meal. I would however recommend that you take her to her pediatrician as soon as possible just to be sure. If she does not have type 1 diabetes it will allieviate your fear and if she does than the sooner she is under a doctors care the better.Please let us know what you find out.Best Wish's,dm",

            "answer": "156 - that's pretty normal for non-diabetic people.\u00a0\u00a0Depends on what she ate prior or how active or not she was just before (remember - adrenalin also raises sugar and so does just sitting).\u00a0\u00a0My parents are non-diabetic and their sugars hit that and higher but go down as well.Unless she is showing the symptoms of diabetes (the constant urination, constant drinking of water, etc.) - I would worry.\u00a0\u00a0But if it would put your mind at ease, have your family doctor do an A1C on her .... that will tell you.",

    "question": "We have a diabetic cat which I monitor frequently using a OneTouchUltra meter at home.\u00a0\u00a0Today my daughter cut her finger sufficient enough to produce a large glob of blood.\u00a0\u00a0Being a curious six-year-old, she asked me to test her blood.\u00a0\u00a0I said sure and was shocked to receive a reading of 156.\u00a0\u00a0Is this potentially \"normal\" for a nondiabetic child or should I call the pediatrician (who I called twice and brought my daugher to see once within the past two weeks, thanks to an unexpected bout with chickenpox)?\u00a0\u00a0I'm not looking for medical advice, just a general opinion as to whether I should be concerned enough to call the pediatrician yet again this month.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
