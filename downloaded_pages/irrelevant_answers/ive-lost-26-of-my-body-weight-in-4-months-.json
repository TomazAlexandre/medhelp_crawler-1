I know you said you've had\u00a0\u00a0the workup but to me something is missing. So, you had a colonoscopy and endoscopy?

I know this also depends on your insurance and I hope you are able to do this without a problem. I wish you a lot of luck and I hope they find out what your underlying problem is. Be well Take Care",

            "answer": "Make sure you get some basic nutrition in your body, despite the fact that your taste and appetite are very low, because you will soon suffer severe consequences of malnutrition with possibly irreversible damage.Products like Ensure or Boost will supply you with the basics, for the time being, until you get this sorted out.Have you ruled out Celiac's, gluten sensitivity -Look into Gliadin test (urine), by Cyrex labs. They test 12 forms-not just the alpha ordered by most doctors- of gliadins regarding gluten intolerance (not necessarily just digestive)- Candida, Leaky Gut Syndrome?Some of these are missed because they are not recognized by conventional medicine, or the proper tests are not done.Let me know if you need more details.Wishing you well.Niko",
