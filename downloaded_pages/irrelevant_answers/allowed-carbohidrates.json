            "answer": "Hello,It is quite safe to limit carbohydrates. However, this will mean that protein and fat intake will need to be increased to ensure adequate calories.Research Low carb diet and diabetes and you will come up with a lot of infomation.You should avoid all refined and processed carbs. This means that your best source of carbs are vegetables (rahter than bread, rice, pasta etc). With diabetes, fruits also need to be limited (particularly the sweet tropical fruits) as they are high in sugar.If you do eat foods like rice and bread, you should eat brown rice and wholegrain bread.\u00a0\u00a0 As foods with more fibre will slow absorption.\u00a0\u00a0But still only eat in moderation.\u00a0\u00a0Make s ure you eat fat and protein with your carbs. This will also slow absorption.I usually don't eat any grains, fruits or starchy vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0But I eat nuts, meats, eggs, avocado, all vegeteables except corn and potatoes, dairy. I do drink wine in moderation.\u00a0\u00a0I am doing fine and feeling great on this diet.\u00a0\u00a0I would normally eat about 50 - 70 g of carbs per day.\u00a0\u00a0My blood sugars can be well controlled on this diet, without medication.In high glycaemic index foods, the carbohydrates are broken down very quickly, and have bigger impact on blood sugar than lower GI foods.\u00a0\u00a0Ie. beans and bagel.\u00a0\u00a0Bagel is high GI and will have more impact on blood sugar than beans, which are low GI - even considering they have the same amount of total carbs.",

            "answer": "1. \"is it important that I also eat (breads, pasta, potatoes and rice in small quantities)?\"Yes, eating these foods in small quantities is possible. But to each individual what is considered small, medium and large may differ. What you may consider small to another person may be medium. You must test preprandial and postprandial to see how much, if any, you can tolerate.2. The difference between simple and complex carbs can be found on the GI. The main point to remember here is that foods with high glycemic index values [simple carbs] should be avoided or taken in moderation while foods with low GI values [complex carbs] are considered a healthier option.Those foods that have high GI values tend to release large amounts of glucose in the blood stream more quickly as compared to those that have low GI values. As a result, the foods with high GI values cause your glucose to rise much faster than the foods low on the GI. Also, eat fruits with other foods to slow the absorption of fructose, fruit sugar.In a nutshell:High GI = simple carbs = high glucose levelsLow GI = complex carbs = low to moderate glucose levelsThe key is test, test, test until you know which foods does what to your glucose levels. Then you will know what to avoid and what to enjoy.",

            "answer": "Thank you so much. Super useful information!.I will try to eat more vegetables as carbohydrate source instead of rice, pasta, etc.Concerning fruits, I do eat a lot of fruits, maybe I would want to cut fruit intake.You mentioned you eat 50 - 70 g of carbs per day. How do you measure the carbs? I have no idea the carb content in each food",

            "answer": "You can look for carbohydrate counters on line.\u00a0\u00a0Here on this site they have trackers.\u00a0\u00a0This includes a food tracker.\u00a0\u00a0If you start a meal tracker for yourself you can enter each food you eat or plan to eat and it will tell you how many carbs are in it (also how many fat and protein grams, and calories). To get your trackers go the the top of the screen and click on \"My Med Help\", click on \"Trackers\" and you will come up with a list of trackers, you can then add the meal tracker.I don't know how big you are, but most likely you'd need somewhere around 2,000 calories a day.Blood sugar control when eating carbs is all about find what you tolerate.\u00a0\u00a0As WaveRider said, test after each meal and you will learn what you can and can't eat.Lower carb fruits such as berries, apples, stone fruits tend to have lower impact than fruits like pineapple, banana, melons, mango.",

            "answer": "THANK YOU SO MUCH! I\u00b4ll check the trackers.When you say that when eating carbs is all about finding what you tolerate, does that mean everyone with sugar problems tolerate different kinds of carbohydrates differently???For example is there someone who tolerates banana differently from another person? or high glicemic foods like banana affect everyone the same way?",

    "question": "Hello. I am trying to do some lifestyle changes including nutrition, but I have some doubts.1. I read that carbohydrates are the main source of energy, so it is important to eat some amount of carbohydrates daily so the body is able to function. There are different types of carbohydrates. For example breads, pasta, potatoes and rice and then there are vegetables and fruits. Can I obtain my carbohydrate intake just by eating (vegetables and fruits), or is it important that I also eat (breads, pasta, potatoes and rice in small quantities)?. Or do I have to eliminate them completely from my diet????2. I do not understand the exact relation between the amount of carbohydrates taken and the glicemic index. Could I eat food of low glicemic index, and still obtain the amount of carbohydrates required daily???? Does high glicemic index means more carbohydrates??? or there is no direct relationship between both???",
