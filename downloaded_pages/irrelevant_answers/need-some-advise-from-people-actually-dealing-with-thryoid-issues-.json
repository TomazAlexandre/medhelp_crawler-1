            "answer": "I would get another just get another Endo, you have symptoms and this guy says go away and come back in six months! I would dump him just for not doing an anti-body test for aut-immune, Hashimoto's or Graves, some nodules will produce hormone on their own, and he only did a TSH. Just to save your self running back and forth trying to find the right MD, make a list of the Endos that you can go to, call the offices and ask them right out if this MD treats Thyroid, Does he base treatments on Free T3 and symptoms or on TSH aloneYou could be Hyper, with the palpatations, and acid reflux is common with thyroid issues,Then you can decide if you want to make an appointment with them or not based on the reply. You should have your Free T3 and Free T4 done, these are much more impotant than TSH since it is only a Pituitary Hormone. Good Luck and if you need any more info, Just Post. Regards FTB4",

    "question": "I will keep this brief.\u00a0\u00a0Have a 3cm complex cystic mass right frontal lobe - US says vascular, multiple nicrocalcifications - FNA Biopsy results as I was told by the Dr. showed follicular cells and thats everything is fine.\u00a0\u00a0I have only been tested for TSH and was told that was normal at 0.91.\u00a0\u00a0Come back in 6 months for another ultrasound - (this is all from an ENT).........Now I have some trouble swallowing although not to bad kinda feels like I have to double swallow to get things down sometimes, I can clearly feel the lump everytime I swallow doesn't hurt but kinda annoying and weird feeling.\u00a0\u00a0I get constant heart palpitations and heart burn which started around 3months ago and nodule was discoved about 1-1/2 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0Now checking my neck more often I found a pea size lump guessing its a lymph node (even had my husband and son feel it to make sure I wasn't imagining it)\u00a0\u00a0 I feel tired and run down alot but I always chalk it up to working full time and raising 3 younger kids.\u00a0\u00a0I ask the Dr. if the heart palpitations could have anything to do with the mass on my thyroid and was told no the nodules don't do things like that...not so sure I believe him but hey he is the Dr. right lolI am trying to decide if I should go for a second opinion and if so should it be another ENT or some other type of Dr. or should I just hang out with this 3cm mass in my neck and heart palpitations for 6 months and just see?Any advise would be greatly appreciated. :)",
