            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Such lumps could be due to neurofibroma (collection of nerve and fibrous tissue) or lipoma (localized collection of fat). Generally they do not require treatment. In diabetes small localized collections of fatty tissue develop under skin where insulin injections are taken. This is not true in your case.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
