            "answer": "Dear NCgirl,I'm not a doctor and don't know much about pre-diabetes, however, I do know that hypoglycemia is a condition, in and of itself, that requires medical treatment.\u00a0\u00a0I have heard that some people with hypoglycemia develop diabetes at some point in their lives, but many do not.\u00a0\u00a0Hypoglycemia is a condition, according to my understanding, where your body metabolizes the sugars you eat very quickly, essentially leaving your body without the fuel it needs to run on.\u00a0\u00a0A change in diet is often recommended; eating frequent meals with lots of protein and complex carbs, since they take a little longer to metabolize.\u00a0\u00a0There are now medications that you can take that will help also.\u00a0\u00a0I would highly recommend that you see an endocrinologist and get some treatment.\u00a0\u00a0The low blood pressure in combination with hypoglycemia can be very scary and dangerous.\u00a0\u00a0The treatment is really easy and very successful. You will feel much better if you understand what is happening and make a few changes in your eating patterns. A doctor is really the best person to tell you how.\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck!Es",

            "answer": "Thank you for your replies. Yesterday I went to the doctor and found out why my sugar and blood pressures were dropping so low. It seems that I have an underlying illness called\u00a0\u00a0\"Opsoclonus Myoclonus Ataxia\".\u00a0\u00a0Basically I'm told that this is a neurological problem where the signals sent out to control the various parts of the body get scrambled sometimes, causing organs and glands, etc. to overact.\u00a0\u00a0In my case, it causes the pancreas to dump huge amounts of either insulin or glucagon into my system, hence the blood sugar goes haywire.\u00a0\u00a0All tests thus far indicate this, and another battery of blood tests was done today.\u00a0\u00a0I'm scheduled for an MRI tomorrow to finalize the diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0The good news is that this problem, while difficult to diagnose in the first place, is very manageable with daily medication. I hope the others on this forum\u00a0\u00a0find a resolution to their problem and get medical help. Thank you once again for your advice.NCgirl1964",

            "answer": "Hi,I also have Hypoglycemia, and I have focused on controlling it through diet. Have you ever heard of food's glycemic index?It's how fast foods/sugar gets absorbed into your system.Speaking for myself only, I prefer not to take medicine if there is a natural way \"out\".I have been using the South Beach diet, and what a world of difference! I tossed all of the anti depressants, and control it all through diet alone.Please check this book out. They should call it The South Beach life saving change of life way to eat, rather than \"Diet\".My Dr. recommended the book, he says he has had patients completely reverse their diabetes following it.And this is a very good, very experienced Dr., the best I have found.Please try it!",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with Hypoglycemia many years ago but never gave it much thought or consideration. When I felt sick or faintish after not eating for many\u00a0\u00a0hours I would just grab something quick and ignor the whole matter. I didn't think hypoglycemia was anything to worry about until lately. Over the last couple of months I've experiecened tingling and numbness in my hands, feet, lips and felt tingling sensations all over my body. My train of thought is interrupted and I feel confused most of the time. I've also fainted a couple of times and I pretty sure I've had at least one siesure. I also have low blood pressure which complicates the issue. When my sugar levels drop my blood pressure follows suit and I get to the point of passing out. I haven't seen a doctor, but I've been reading articles that lead me to believe that I may be pre-diabetic. The only thing is I don't understand how you can go from having low blood sugar to being a diabeitc. I thought diabetics had too much sugar in their blood stream. I've checked mine with a monitor and it usually falls around 70 to 95. My blood pressure usually is around 100/60 but falls to 80/60 to 60/45 when I experience these episodes. Can anyone explain what pre-diabetes is and how you can go from being a person with Hypoglycemia to pre-diabetes? Please resopnd. Thank you!",
