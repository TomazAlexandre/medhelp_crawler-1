            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes both oral contraceptives and antibiotics can cause abdominal bloating. Take probiotics and see. If the bloating is due to antibiotics, it will settle down. If not, change your OCP and see. If still you do not benefit, then other causes will need to be looked at.Other than IBS or spastic colon you could be suffering from Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/ Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, diabetes, food intolerance, malabsorption syndromes, constipation, gallbladder and liver problems, pancreatic dysfunction, or taking a diet rich in sulfites. Cancers of the gut and in female ovarian cancer too could be a cause.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

    "question": "I have been experiencing extreme abdominal bloating for over a year now. I do not think this is related to my diet and my bowels are regular. I've seen mulitple doctors and every test comes back normal. Could this be caused by oral contraceptives or from my daily use of\u00a0\u00a0two different anti-biotics to treat acne and vaginal strep B? I look like I'm pregnant and I'm uncomfortable all the time.",
