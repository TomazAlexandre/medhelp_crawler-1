            "answer": "I agree with the other posters about a low-carb diet.\u00a0\u00a0Since I'm an early riser, eating small meals every two hours allows me to take in something at least 4 times daily, as well as walking exercise plus housework.\u00a0\u00a0I also reorganized my meals so that my heaviest meal is in the middle of the day rather than in the evening when I'm less active, even with late-day walking.\u00a0\u00a0If it's practical, you should keep a supply of health bars in your desk or locker at work to act as a small meal.I have chosen to forgo diabetes medication, so the small meals allow my natural insulin production to be released in small bursts that the body can deal with rather than huge, unabsorbable gushes. I consulted an endocrinologist who explained that any medication has a two-to-three-year productivity span before it needs to be boosted with additional meds.\u00a0\u00a0He also recommended eating less fruit which, of course, contains sugar.If your doctor hasn't given you literature to help plan your meals with diabetes in mind, you can probably download information from the Internet.",

            "answer": "thank you for all your information. i've already started most of what you all have suggested. i have lost 10 lbs in the last 4 months by cutting out rice, breads and pasta. my average carb intake is arounf 40-48 per meal leaving my last meal of the day mostly meat and veggies with low carbs. my heavy meal is lunch at work and i usually fix my lunch myself so that i can control the carbs. i have taken a class at the hospital for diabetes. i don't like taking the meds expecially now that my doctor has increased to another med. when i don't take the meds my blood sugar stays within 10 points. so that tells me that the meds are not working. i have tracked my blood sugar reading for the past 2 wks after adding on the new med and still no change. i have an appointment with my doctor on monday and if she can't figure this out, then i'm going to ask her to send me to an endocrinologist. i have high cholestrol and thyroid problems. my last blood work in december showed my thyroid has good levels and the meds is working. at times i just want to give up on this meds and go back to using herbs, but as we all know the doctors do not accept herbs as treatment. i thank all of you for giving me the information. it helps to know that i am at least eating on the right track. i try to excerise 2 to 3 times a week, but i have bad knees and hip that causes me to not be able to do as much as i would like. again i thank everyone for your help and look forward to any other ideas you might have. i'll let you know next week after i see the doctor.",

            "answer": "If you are really still having high sugars a very low carb diet may be the answer, at least to see how much control you can gain.For example, I usually eat about 10 - 15 g of carbs at breakfast, then 20 g lunch and 20 g dinner.\u00a0\u00a0No snacks.\u00a0\u00a0See if you can get your carb down to 50 - 70 g a day and if this makes a difference.test after meals so you can see the impact of hwat you ate.always eat fat and protein with your carbs.",
