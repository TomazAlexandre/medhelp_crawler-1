            "answer": "Since you gave it time to heal and it hasn't completely, maybe going to the doctor and have them take a look at it is the best option. It is possible that it is a STD (or some other medical condition that makes sex painful), but it could just be friction or tearing (although 2 years is a long time for this to continue). The base of the opening to the vagina can tear slightly if it got stretched too much during intercourse. Maybe you were not excited enough before penetration. Your libido could vary with your cycle or maybe you were just afraid that it would hurt and tear again so you didn't get as excited as normal. You could try some lubricant, but you may also need more foreplay so that the opening expands enough that it doesn't get torn. Also, some angles of entry (due to whatever position you were doing), will stretch the opening more than others, so try to find one where the he goes straight in instead of at an angle. As far the skin sloughing off, if it is still a problem, you could try Monistat's Anti-chaffing gel to reduce friction as you move around during the day (don't use it during sex) or you could try shaving or waxing your hair. As far as the horny husband, you could try things other than vaginal sex, such as oral sex or using your hands or other body parts (although this may not be much fun for you). Goodluck!",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Though Nuva-ring does not cause ulcerations, this could be the likely cause. Hence maybe you should remove this and see if it helps. Bacterial infection and herpes too could be a cause and hence get this tested. It could also be an infected burst Bartholin cyst. Bacterial skin infection as seen in diabetes too could be a cause.Consult your gynecologist as soon as possible. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi, I am 19 and have been married for almost 2 years now. My husband and I were each others firsts, and when we first started having sex, pieces of skin sluffed off, I am assuming it was my hymen. I have been riding horses for 10 years and I don't recall my first time really being painful. But since we got married, I have a small piece of skin that refuses to heal, making intercouse VERY painful. We have been celebate for almost a month now and a couple of days ago we tried to have sex and he barely started pushing into me when it hurt so bad I spotted. I now have a small white area just under the entrace to my vagina. My husband said it looked like an ulcer. I am on the NeuvaRing Birth Control so I don't know if that will have anything to do with it. What do I have? I am planning to go in to a ObGyn to get a diagnosis and find out why it hurts so much! My husband is horny all the time and my usually high Libido has steadily declined to nothing.. I want to know what is wrong! I want it fixed so I can make love to my husband!",
