            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Lupus is a multi-organ disease. It can affect the kidneys, skin, heart, lungs, and GI tract. It can also affect the central nervous system (i.e., psychiatric disturbances, seizures, migraines, sensory changes, and even stroke).The ANA pattern can be seen in many diseases. I would recommend that you have additional tests performed such as a double stranded DNA and SSA/SSB. You may need to see a rheumatologist for the lupus workup but also to rule out other connective tissue disorders such as Sjogrens. Also, if you have not had one performed, an oral glucose tolerance test is necessary to workup the gastroparesis. This is a good test to rule out/in diabetes.Regarding the symptoms you are experiencing, they all may be related to an underlying disorder such as lupus. The tilt table is not impressive based on your description. You should make sure you are drinking plenty of fluids (as recommended by your physician) and monitor your blood pressure. It is hard to say if you need another MRI of the brain. Were your prior MRI\u2019s with contrast or did you have an MRA of the vessels in the brain?I agree that you should see a neurologist to evaluate the sensory changes you are experiencing. However, I highly recommend that you follow up with a rheumatologist. If you do have lupus or another connective tissue disorder, the treatment requires a specialist.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
