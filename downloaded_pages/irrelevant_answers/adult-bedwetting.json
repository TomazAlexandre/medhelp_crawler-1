            "answer": "Hi, probably this overflow incontinence. In this condition, patients never feel the urge to urinate, the bladder never empties, and small amounts of urine leak continuously. Overflow incontinence is prevalent in older men with an enlarged prostate.\u201cOverflow incontinence is a common symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The prostate is located directly beneath the bladder and in front of the rectum. The upper portion of the urethra passes through the prostate, so when the gland becomes enlarged it may obstruct the passage of urine through the urethra.Neurogenic bladder associated with overflow incontinence is caused by the loss of sensation of bladder fullness due to damage or obstruction of sacral nerves (located in the five vertebrae above the sacrum). This may result from certain types of surgery on the spinal cord, sacral spinal tumors, or birth defects. It also may be a complication of various diseases such as diabetes mellitus and polio\u201d.
