            "answer": "A cervical MRI should be enough to pick up any kind of spinal cord lesion that affects the sensations in your arms. A formal neuro exam, visual evoked potentials, and brain MRI that are all normal theoretically point away from the diagnosis of MS. Glad the B12 shots made you feel better. B12 deficiency can leave permanent damage, but usually the degree of the lab value deficiency is much more severe than what you mentioned yours was.One test that may be helpful is an EMG to look at the integrity of the nerves in your arm. You may have what's called a peripheral neuropathy. Talk to your neuro and see what he/ she thinks. GOod luck.",

    "question": "I am a 41 year old woman who has undergone many tests in the last two years to determine the cause of odd tingling/numbness in both hands and both feet. Brain and cervical MRI's, evoked potentials, several neuro exams were all clear. Neuro said absiolutely not MS. I have also been tested for every otherpossible cause - diabetes, thyroid, lupus,Sjorgrens,\u00a0\u00a0etc. The feelings remain constant, I am now experiencing a \"twanging\" feeling ( kind of like an electrical shock) going from my mid-spine to my left arm . It happens when I make a specific movement. Could this indicate a spinal lesion in that area?( I only\u00a0\u00a0had a cervical MRI) . Should I go back to the neuro?I did have a lower-end B-12 ( 300) and have been taking weekly shots, which make me feel better overall, but have not changed the constant tingling. Could low b12\u00a0\u00a0 have caused permanent\u00a0\u00a0damage?I guess my question is - should I just accept this scenario, or does this new symptom indicate a trip\u00a0\u00a0to the neuro ? And do you have any further suggestions for causes? ( I still worry very much about MS)Thnaks for your answer... a wonderful forum !",
