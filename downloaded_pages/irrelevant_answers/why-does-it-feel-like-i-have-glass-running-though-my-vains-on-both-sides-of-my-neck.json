            "answer": "Hi!Yes, an abnormal sensation felt along the course of a nerve is due to neuropathy. It can be diabetes elated in your case. It could also be a pinched spinal nerve in the neck due to wrong posture or working too long on computers etc. You need to keep diabetes under strict control. Also, you can take vitamin B 12 and a multivitamin. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
