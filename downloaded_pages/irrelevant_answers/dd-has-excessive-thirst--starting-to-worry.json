Do you think she just wakes up and it's normal behavior for her to ask for a drink so she does? And when she gets it she just chugs it? I try to limit her intake before bed and she's woke up dry the last week. How is the sleeping in her own room going??",

She'll either get really tired and act it, OR get really tired and geared up!I feel fine, that's why I'm sure something wrong, ha ha.. No headaches, sore boobs, NOTHING.
