Guess I will check on that in the fall when I have a physical.\u00a0\u00a0I thought my post tx weight gain was due to lack of motivation -- still do.\u00a0\u00a0But I just can't figure out why I can't motivate.Hope all is well in the great northwest.bean",

            "answer": "Elaine..LoL.... well... I feel pretty stupid about not knowing about the frozen blood... just never really thought about it I guess... at my old doc in Ga... they just came to your exam room & drew the blood & stuck it in a little wire basket that stood the vials up... & I never saw it again... so it just never occurred to me, However it would still be interesting to know if the dang Hep virus survives FREEZING though...On this other stuff.... I suppose it could be NEITHER... so until I get the actual results its speculating... I just never would have even considered diabetic....I'll just be glad to figure out what the heck has caused that sudden weight gain.. it was like 50 lbs in 4 months... If I'd of only been contending with 10, or even 20... it wouldn't have been near as unsettling ...I do know that when I skip my B12 injections.. I have NO Energy.. so maybe my b12 is masking some symptoms ...Goofers...Ya know... at this point I don't think I even care what they find... I just want what ever it is identified so I can fix or maintain what-ever is going on... shish..I guess sometimes it takes something like this to discover what is going on (like when I went to the doc to quit smoking & discovered Hep C instead).. so maybe all this is good & in the long run, I'll be better off for having discovered it... vs leaving something unknown untreated!MKeela...Holy Cow Woman.. West Nile... That's something you read about & never think anyone you ever know will become affected.. WoW... I'll return the favor & say a special prayer for you tonight too... Thanks !!!!Bean,I didn't yet... but will soon..Honey..LoL... not MY fault their dang freezer was broke.. Ha!Golden...WoW.. You Too..??Well I think my blood pressure was actually GOOD... it was 112 over 68 (so at least I was CALM)...LoLI haven't had a chance to really research any of this yet, but plan to tonight.... I guess if it does turn out to be a glucose thing... it would be due to the past gestational problemo... I'll learn more about those numbers... & what they mean tonight!I got bummed today though because my better half (who does have thyroid problems) got his blood work done yesterday too .. & his was already back... ... guess it took longer for mine because of the additional test.....Grrr... I HATE WAITING!!!Ya'll,Well there will be NO dieting tomorrow by golly.... I am going to be eating my (Bad Carbs)... I am fixing RIBS, Potato Salad, Corn On The Cob.. & I REFUSE To Feel Guilty ... now at the end of the week I may get some post guilt... but for now I am not gonna think or worry about it till I get some kind of dang diagnosis... do you know it has almost been a year since AI have enjoyed potato salad... This just ain't right... I really miss my BAD Foods sometimes... Ha!Hey.... Have a Happy 4th Ya'll.. & eat some extra bad food for me...LoLNaa, seriously.. I hope everyone treating gets to enjoy at least minimal sxs tomorrow!;)",

    "question": "Things that make you go Hummmm,Have ya'll ever heard of.... or did you know.... that when you go for your blood draw for a PCR, that the sample is FROZEN?????Just wondered if anyone ever heard of that or knew That????(Or was there a MISTAKE)...????I went yesterday to have all my bloodwork done for PCR & Thyroid,Well.... I wound up NOT getting the PCR because when the gal went t draw the sample for it in the Drs office.... she had to call the lab to find out which \"Vial\" to use... & was told the \"Purple ICE\"... I was sitting there thinking... HUH....(I could have told her it was the BIG Tube, & that it had a purple stopper in the end) well, (but that's about ALL I knew) She said that they couldn't do my sample because it has to be frozen & sent to the lab, & that their freezer in their little fridge was broken... so I would have to go directly to the lab & have That particular blood draw done .... so I have the slip, & I will still go within a week or so... I just didn't have time to run across town & make yet another stop yesterday!I just thought that was interesting, & I had never heard that before... or didn't KNOW... so makes me wonder if that was correct is all... Humm!!Okay, another Hummmmmmmm!!When I consulted & inquired about the thyroid test... another interesting tidbit came up... the fact that I had gestation diabetes way back when I was prego with my kids... I was informed that 40% of women that had gestation diabetes wind up with adult type 2 diabetes... & that being a diabetic could ALSO cause this massive weight gain that I experienced after coming off of TX... & that it would also explain the \"NOT\" being able to loose the weight either,,.???How Odd!!!Soooo, they ran a check for that too along with the TSH & T4 uptake!!!I'm kind of stumped by this...I mean I pretty much eat a diabetic diet now, ... I watch the carbs, & calories... & make sure that any carbs consumed are only Good Clean Carbs... everything I do is pretty much based on the glycemic index...Makes me wonder \"If\" I turn out to be diabetic... does this mean I will stay fat.. shishHumm, First my Dog.. Now Me..??? How weird would THAT be..??I'm still CONVINCED it has to be my Thyroid.. & not this diabetic stuff... I mean I have no signs... & If gestational diabetes is known to take a turn... wouldn't it have happened LONG before now... I mean my Youngest Child is 19 now.. plus I don't have any signs (that I know of)...Shish!Which would be worse..?? Kind of feels like Pick your Poison.. I think I am just SHOCKED that it was even suggested, I just never would have suspected!!!Anyway, guess I'll know more in 3 or 4 days... just thought it was all rather interesting... & I guess next week I'll drag myself down to the lab for that PCR!Guuurrrr!!!;)P.S... If this lands on the wrong side... I am sorry... the drop down doesn't have an entry for \"COMMUNITY\"",
