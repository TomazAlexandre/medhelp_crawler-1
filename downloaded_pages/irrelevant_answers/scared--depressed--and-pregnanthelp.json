I'm not really sure about the other issues. But I will certainly pray for you and your family! Bless you and may you have a healthy and relaxed 9 months!",

            "answer": "I agree with the others in terms of telling your Doc immediately regarding the medication that you are taking and that you are trying to wean yourself, b/c as mamafessler said, they may have something 'baby-safe\" that will give you just as much pain relief.\u00a0\u00a0Also see what you may be able to take for depression.....There are all kinds of meds that people can take while pregnant....This should be a happy time for you, and if medication helps you along....it will be well worth it.Do not be depressed about the possibility of gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I also failed my 1 hour glucose test (at 6 weeks...due to my mother having gest. diabetes for all 3 of us kids) and took my 3 hour fasting glucose about 1 week later and I passed that one.....So you may be OK as far tas that goes.....The one hour is not fasting, so it's based on whatever you ate prior to the test....anything with high carbs would have caused you to 'fail' it.....I too had terrible headaches.....tylenol didn't work so I just dealt, even though it felt like my head was going to blow off!\u00a0\u00a0heehee......They say that has to do with hormone shifts....Best of luck with everything...and get yourself some baby-safe meds to help you thru this!",

            "answer": "OK gestational diabetes is only a pregnant thing is does NOT mean it will be there forever.. and a lot of women go thru that all the time.\u00a0\u00a0ABOUT the pills FIRST tell your doctor. If anything he will help you. he will not look down on you for telling him...the one thing you should not do is NOT tell him,\u00a0\u00a0And second pain pills are a depressant.. so maybe in you weaned off them you would feel better?\u00a0\u00a0But you need to wean off them. otherwise you can have some serious side effects.. i know personally. your doctor can make the best judgement for how to do that. And try as best as you can to be stress-free and happy. maybe read a magazine or a book just try not to focus on all the bad things and try to focus on the good things that will come in time!good luck:)",

            "answer": "you will probably not like what i have to say, but someone needs to.are you crazy?\u00a0\u00a0why are you taking meds that could harm or kill your baby? i just recently lost a baby and would give anything to be pregnant again. so many women pray for a baby everyday, and you are taking 6-7 pills per day? i understand that you have an addiction, but it isn't just you anymore that you need to be concerned about. do what you need to get help. tell your dr. for one, and if you need to go to rehab, then so be it. your child should be number 1 in your life now.\u00a0\u00a0i am sorry you are depressed, but like everyone else has said, there may be medication out there that is safe for your baby. i think the reason you didn't tell your dr. is because you know that you are not supposed to be taking the pain pills while pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0i am sorry this sounds angry, but have you read any of these forums where people are having hard times conceiving or have lost a baby?\u00a0\u00a0you should read a few.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0get well, for you and your baby. i wish you best of luck.",

            "answer": "Your doctor won't look down on you. His job is to help you. His concern will be your health and that of the unborn baby, so you need to tell him about the meds. He may have an alternative or suggestions for you. I cannot tell you how frustrating it is for a doc to have a patient and only know their partial medical history because something can be misdiagnosed and someone can die or get hurt.As far as your other concerns, fatigue is normal during pregnancy. It's just a symptom and yes, it can be debilitatingly difficult at times. I was so tired most times I could barely walk! Gestational diabetes is just that. Gestational means \"during pregnancy\". But you need to be careful and do what you're supposed to or gestational diabetes can later become regular diabetes.You need progesterone to support the pregnancy. A lot of women do, it's really not a huge deal unless you stop taking it.Focus on the wonderful things about pregnancy. You'll get to see your baby on ultrasound and feel the baby move. Decorate the nursery and pick out names! I kept a journal with my pregnancies and my husband and I would guess our babies' genders and what they would look like. It was so much fun after they were born to read through the journals and see who guessed everything right! (Mostly him, actually!)I found reading the good parts of pregnancy books helped me. Reading about baby's development, etc. Feel free to message me privately if you need some more support.",

    "question": "I am really praying for some kind and supportive advice. I am currently 6wks2days pregnant. I am already haveing numerous issues. i saw my Ob at 4wks5days and had a U/S that showed nothing more than my uterus and a fluid filled sac. Doc said it was to early to see much else. I then recieved a phone call from Ob office stating I needed to start taking PROMETHRIUM because my progestirone was only 11.4 and was put on 200mg X 2 a day. I really don't even feel pregnant, short of extreme fatique and sore boobs. I had a horrible migraine at 51/2 weeks, it lasted 3 days, I called my Ob to see what I could take besides Tylenol, he sent me for a gestational diabetes test, which I failed, I know have to do the 3 hr test and through all of this I have become extremely depressed, i had been diagnosed with Major depresion prior to pregnancy.I have been taking Lortab or Norco along with a variety of other meds for back pain and migraines before my pregnancy, I tried to stop as soon as I had my U/S and felt horrible. My OB does not know about these meds, I am afraid to tell hime for fear he will look down on me for needing these meds, I have given my pain meds to my husband who is only giveing them to me as needed and helping me wean off them. i am down to 6-7 a day within 2 weeks, I was taking 12 a day on bad days.I really hope someone can give me some hopeful advice. My OB is not going to understand my need for Pain meds, I did not tell hime my first appointment think I could just quit, I am scared.... please help me.How concerned should I be about all of these issues?extreme fatique, low progesterone, gestational diabetes, migraines\u00a0\u00a0a dependacy to hydrocodone and major depression?May Godspeed to you all and to my unborn child who has no choice.Sarah",
