    "question": "For the last about 10-15 days, I have severe cracking of the foreskin along with swelling and also the color of the head of my penis varies - day to day - from blotchy gray patches to small bright red spots (underside of head).\u00a0\u00a0I tried cleaning with alcohol, but had unbearable pain (acute burning) for quite a long time even after I washed it off with lots of water. Of late, the head seems ok, but the foreskin continues to be cracked and it is extremely painful to clean the head as I experience a lot of pain when I pull back the foreskin to do this. The cracks -on foreskin-do not seem to be healing. On the contrary, I feel they have increased in number and decreased in individual size.I've had sex with same partner - my wife - since 15 years. She does not seem to have any problems and for last couple of weeks we've stopped having sex. Do not think this is a STD.I do have diabetes which is under control through medication and exercise. Fasting & PP counts are normal (both under 105). What can this be?? What do I do?",
