I dont know what is the problem cause I can have the same symptoms even when its warm outside.The only solution I found helping me getting warm again is when I take a very warm / hot bath. It really does the trick.Good luck\u00a0\u00a0:-)Andrea",

    "question": "I have been snowboarding for over a year and suffer from chills for hours after I get home every time. I live about an hour and a half from the resort and after about 30 minutes after we leave the resort everyone else has warmed up and wants the heater off and I will continue to shiver and freeze the entire ride home and for another 5 hours or so after I get back home. I always change into dry clothes before I leave the resort and am completely fine the entire time I am snowboarding and the first small part of the ride and then out of nowhere my body starts to freak out and I can't get warm no matter what I try. After I get home I will heat blankets but nothing seems to help. I have talked to all the other snowboarders and skiers I know but no one else has had this happen to them.",
