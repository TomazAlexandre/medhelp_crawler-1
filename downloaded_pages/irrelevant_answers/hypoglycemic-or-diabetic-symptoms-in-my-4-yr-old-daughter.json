            "answer": "Dear Mom_Of_four,First off, i'm\u00a0\u00a0not a doctor just a person\u00a0\u00a0with diabetes trying to answer questions from my experience. To me, it seems unlikely that this is caused by diabetes because diabetics sometimes have a 'dawn phenominon' where the blood sugars rises which wouldn't be helped by juice. Although it does seem to resemble high blood sugar which is what happens in undiagnosed diabetes, but this would be best handled by a doctor who may have better insight than me and be able to know by the symptoms and some blood tests.good luck with your doctor appointment, bret",

So, as I said before going to the doctor is the best thing and discussing all your issues with them good too-you know your child!",

            "answer": "Dear Mom_of_4I am not a doctor either but I have been diabetic for 36 years and have a 14 year old daughter myself. It also sounds like low blood sugars to me. I also have night terrors about sharks when I have low bloodsugars at night and I get real tired first thing in the morning because of really low blood sugars. I have grown used to keeping sugar soda by my bed at night. I also think the best thing you can do is talk to her doctor. Good Luck and I hope everything is solved for you",

    "question": "I have an appt set up to see our ped on the 12th.My daughter is 4 and a half and seems to have the occasional \"morning spell\" as I call it.Only seems to happen in the morning.During a spell my dd looks and acts tired,she wants to sit or lay down,she tells me that her tummy hurts.I can literally *see* the color drain from her face and lips (very frightening).I have also noticed that her gums go pale.Her skin feels cool and very clammy.She becomes \"spacey\" like.Shes never been completely unresponsive but she is extending much effort to talk.When I see a \"spell\" coming on,it progresses extremely fast!Juice seems to perk her up slowly.These spells happen infrequently,my first thought was anemia but past tests were negative and I doubted anemia would react to juice??The spells usually last anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour.She is normally a VERY active child.Also,she is a very hearty eater.Wants snacks every 15 minutes.Her BIG thing is bread.She will eat an entire loaf of bread(or more)everyday if I let her.During the day she becomes excessively cranky at times. Whining and crying about minor things,cant seem to sit still.Overly tired or maybe due to low sugar?She also suffers from \"night terrors\".I recently read that low sugar levels during the night can cause terrors.Are pre diagnosed diabetic spells frequent or a slow process like my dd's symptoms?Are these hypo symptoms? Can it lean toward diabetes now,or in the future?I sincerely thank you if you can maybe give me some validation about my fears or helpful insight.Hoping to hear similar stories and outcomes.",
