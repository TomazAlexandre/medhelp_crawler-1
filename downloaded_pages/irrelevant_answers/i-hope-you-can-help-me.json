            "answer": "Hey there,I've just read your last post, so you know what I am going to say.\u00a0\u00a0You absolutely need to be under the care of a psychiatrist.\u00a0\u00a0The way doctors determine if we need to be hospitalized is to ask 'is patient a danger to herself or others'.\u00a0\u00a0The answer is yes to both questions.The answer to this question is: no!\u00a0\u00a0You have tried a short term anti anxiety medication: think it was Xanax.\u00a0\u00a0Great for calming a panic attack, but doesn't stay in system for long.Klonopin would be a better choice for anti anxiety. There are lots of things a doctor can have you try.On May 11 Greenlydia gave all new people in forum very good suggestions for what we need to know when you first contact us.\u00a0\u00a0Please take a look at it.\u00a0\u00a0Would have saved you posting twice within an hour.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, if you just want to post when you feel bad and need to get your emotions out, that is ok too.Hope you will keep posting.\u00a0\u00a0We are not doctors.\u00a0\u00a0But all of us have suffered with extreme anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0Some to point of not being able to function or leave our homes.Last thing I will address: a move from one place to another is not the answer to a mental disorder.\u00a0\u00a0It comes from faulty brain chemistry.\u00a0\u00a0Same as if you had diabetes: it would not go away with a move.\u00a0\u00a0These are internal disorders.\u00a0\u00a0Require medication and doctor's supervision.",

            "answer": "Uh, not to start a ruckus, but nobody knows where anxiety problems or depression comes from.\u00a0\u00a0No one's ever found different brain chemistry is the sufferers and the non-sufferers.\u00a0\u00a0That's pharmaceutical company advertising, not fact.\u00a0\u00a0It may be true, may not be.\u00a0\u00a0It's still an open question.\u00a0\u00a0What is believed is that not all problems are from the same source.\u00a0\u00a0Some anxiety stems from a specific event, not brain chemistry at all even hypothetically.\u00a0\u00a0Some is without any known event, and therefore no known cause.\u00a0\u00a0Medication cures nothing in this area or most others -- it mitigates symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0For many of us, that's the best we can do, and may be for the poster; I don't know.\u00a0\u00a0If there is a cure, it's through therapy and homework, but that's not guaranteed either.\u00a0\u00a0There are many different treatment modalities, some natural, some medicinal, some therapy related, some just go away.\u00a0\u00a0Again, I can't claim to be able to help the poster or know what's needed in this case, but it's good to know there are options.",
