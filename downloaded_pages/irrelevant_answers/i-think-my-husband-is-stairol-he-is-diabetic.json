I am diabetic as well.\u00a0\u00a0Been that way for 19+years.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes should not make him sterile, it is a possibility though.\u00a0\u00a0Like the others said, if you have been pregnant before, it is very uncommon to just become sterile without surgery or some other traumatic event.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetic\u00a0\u00a0men usually dont have much trouble.\u00a0\u00a0From what i have read, i hate to say it, but it seems like the problem may be with you.\u00a0\u00a0Have you always been regular?\u00a0\u00a0Do you have a family history of pregnancy problems? Spontaneous Abortion can happen to anyone, but usually if it happens one time, it can mean other problems.\u00a0\u00a0You should go see your gyno and get checked out. If you dont find anything there, then get his sperm count checked.\u00a0\u00a0If he is not sterile, and you are ok, maybe IVF is a possibility (in vetro fertilization).\u00a0\u00a0That is what we are facing now, only we are trying to find a surrogate mother to have my egg (fertilized by hubby's sperm) implanted in her and she will carry baby to term.\u00a0\u00a0That way baby is still genetically ours.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and if I can help you any, my e-mail addy is ***@****\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck!!you are in my prayers.Christina",
