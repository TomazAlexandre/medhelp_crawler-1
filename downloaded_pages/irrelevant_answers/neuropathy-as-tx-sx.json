METHODS: We studied 52 patientswith HCV (38 men, 14 women; mean age 44.6\u00a0\u00a010.6 years) treated with IFNalpha.Before therapy (T(0)), patients underwent quantitative viral RNA determination,HCV genotype analysis, and neurologic and electrophysiologic evaluation. At theend (T(1)) and after therapy (T(2)), patients were neurologically andelectrophysiologically re-evaluated. Antibodies to gangliosides and sulfatideswere assayed by ELISA at T(0) and T(1). Twenty-three patients with HCV withcomparable age, viral load, and genotype, not treated with IFNalpha, werestudied as controls. RESULTS: Seven patients (six in IFNalpha, one control) hadperipheral neuropathy at recruitment. No significant differences in theelectrophysiologic measures were detected between T(0) and T(1)(repeated-measures analysis of variance [ANOVA]) in any of the 52 patients or inthose with neuropathy at T(0). No changes were found at T(2), independent of theviral response to treatment. Two patients, one with neuropathy, hadantiganglioside antibodies at recruitment. Two patients, one not treated withIFNalpha, developed low antibody titers during follow-up, without symptoms orsigns of neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Pegylated interferon alpha therapy was notassociated with the occurrence (or worsening) of peripheral neuropathy orantibodies to peripheral nerve antigens in patients with hepatitis C virus.",
