I also have to take synthroid and was told that without it there was a high risk of miscarriage and that during pregnancy the meds may need to be increased.",

    "question": "Ok well long story cut short. Trying for a year, nothing :( so March this year got diagnosed with underactive thyroid TSH of 93!! Once in tablets I got pregnant when my TSH hit 30 but early miscarriage. Then I got pregnant again in July with TSH 12 but again miscarried. So thort I'd hold off till it was stable. My TSH is now 0.24 on 125mlg levothyroxine. I'm still petrified that I'm still gonna miscarry when I fall pregnant again. Anyone been through something similar? I'll find out in 10 days if I'm pregnant this cycle :0",
