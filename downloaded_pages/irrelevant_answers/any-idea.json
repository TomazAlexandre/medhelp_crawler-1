            "answer": "You really should get some tests done to help figure out what may be wrong. The first things that come to my mind are glucose tests and thyroid tests. Make sure to ask your doctor to test for your tsh, t3 and t4 because sometimes the tsh isn't reliable. Diabetes uncontrolled is said to give people bad breath sometimes. Although it doesn't sound like your at high risk for it, it may be something to rule out. Either way you should talk to your doctor, because it does sound like something serious might be happening.",

    "question": "I am 41, I don't exercise much, I am 175cm tall & weigh 70kg (most of the time)... Lately (the last 6 months or so) I have been feeling ill after eating (like I haven't eaten all day & will be sick if I don't eat something shortly), have bad breath (so i have been told) & seem to have a lot of rumbles in my stomach in the afternoon.. I know my mum has thyroid tablets, but am unsure if that is for over or under activity. I am sick of feeling hungry all the time, but know I am not... please help as I don't like the idea of bad breath & this sick feeling is really starting to get me down..Thanks..",
