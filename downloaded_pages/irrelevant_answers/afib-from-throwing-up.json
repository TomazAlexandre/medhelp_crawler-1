            "answer": "I read you to say you have a medical diagnosis of intermittent AFib.\u00a0\u00a0 Or is this a self diagnosis or assumption based on your description.\u00a0\u00a0You say the \"test results\" (assumed by a medical doctor) show no abnormalities.\u00a0\u00a0I believe \"paroxysmal\" (intermittent) or less AFib is very hard to diagnose unless one is lucky to be on an EKG when it occurs, or on a wearable monitor.You didn't say why you were throwing up.\u00a0\u00a0If from too much alcohol, I'd say that may be the cause not only of the stomach problem but of the AFib.If your doctor didn't recommend a mild anticoagulant, such as aspirin, I suggest you talk with him/her about this subject.\u00a0\u00a0AFib increases the chance of the formation of blood clots... but in the case of proxo-AFig the increase risk is small, maybe not enough to take the wear and tear of a regular aspirin.\u00a0\u00a0I have taken aspirin for years and have no stomach problems from it.",

            "answer": "I got food poisoning or a stomach virus over the summer and I threw up twice.\u00a0\u00a0Both times I went into what felt like afib.\u00a0\u00a0I have had 1 documented (was on monitor when it happened) episode.\u00a0\u00a0Thankfully, I was able to stop it with vagal manuevers.\u00a0\u00a0Ask my EP at my next appointment and he said it was very common for that to happen because it does something to your vagal nerve.\u00a0\u00a0Now every time I get nauseous I get scared to death.",
