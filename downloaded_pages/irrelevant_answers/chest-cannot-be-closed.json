            "answer": "Hi,How is your sister? There are some cases where the chest is better left opened because of too much swelling or inflammation as a result of the operation.\u00a0\u00a0However, as the swelling subsides, an attempt to closure is done to prevent the risk of infection among other things. There are a lot of factors that could have lead to this. The condition of the patient, the presence of other co-morbidities and her immune system are just some of the reasons why this happened. Discuss any doubts or queries with her doctors. And the way i see it, they are doing their best for her.Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "My Sister had open heart surgery. Her chest could not be closed. They said her heart was too swollen and is very damaged. What are the statistics on this happening. I am very worried and they have put her in a drug induced coma. They will try on Sunday to remove the heart pump and to close up her chest. She had her surgery today on Friday. Any answers as to why and how often this happens? Her Surgical team really is fighting to keep her alive.",
