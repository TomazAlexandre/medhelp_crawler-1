I had bloodwork done about a month ago without thyroid and everything checked out, so last week my doctor did take blood for thyroid and that came out normal as well. Maybe the lack of sleep and anxiety is causing the weight loss but I know my body pretty well and this is very unusual. I will keep rattling their cage if I keep losing weight. Thanks,",

            "answer": "Welcome to the WL&D community!\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for posting your question; you have already received some excellent advice from a few of our caring and knowledgeable members.Am certainly glad to see you know your body well and that you are collaboratively researching some of the possibilities of your recent weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0With your thyroid tests being normal, diabetes also comes to mind.\u00a0\u00a0Have you noticed any change in thirst/drinking?In doing a little research online, here are some reasons for unintentional weight loss that need to be considered and/or researched further .. depression, frequent diarrhea, hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland), infection, poor nutrition, AIDS, and cancer. If you're trying to figure out why someone else is losing weight unintentionally, you may also want to look into drug abuse, eating disorders, and smoking.Unexplained Weight Loss and Colon Cancer - Tumors are their own life form. They require a blood supply and energy to grow, and they also release their own waste products. Since they're living inside you, tumors use your blood and nutrients, and release their waste products inside your body. You're unlikely to notice the diversion of blood and nutrients, but sometimes tumors release chemicals that increase the body's metabolism (such as burn calories faster), which can lead to unexplained weight loss.Medical Attention for Unexplained Weight Loss - According to the National Institutes of Health, adults should consult a medical professional if they've lost more than 5% of their body weight over the past 6 to 12 months without trying. (That would be about 10 pounds for a 200-pound person.) You should also call your doctor if you experience unexplained weight loss in conjunction with other potential colon cancer symptoms.Please don't be alarmed .. this is just information to help you work through this process and get the answers\u00a0\u00a0you need.Very best wishes .. and please let us know how you are doing and what you find out.",
