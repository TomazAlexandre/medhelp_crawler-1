            "answer": "Hi!Even if you are taking multivitamin pills, get your iron levels, hemoglobin levels tested. Iron deficiency is the commonest cause of hair fall. It can also be seasonal hair fall. Hair loss can also be due to dandruff, dermatitis, shampoos, oils, soaps, dust and dirt etc. Thyroid disorders and diabetes too could be a cause. Insomnia, stress and anxiety along with poor diet and excess of caffeine too can be the cause. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I'm 13 right, and I do straighten my hair. Not all the time, like once or twice a month because I have such thick hair and it takes forever. But recently, quite a bit of my hair has been falling out. Not like when I wake up there's like a bunch of hair on my pillow, it's nothing like that. Its like if I had my hair in a ponytail, if I lightly tugged on the tail, then some hair came out. I'm quite worried, but it can't be lack of iron because once a day I take multivitamin tablets. Please help!",
