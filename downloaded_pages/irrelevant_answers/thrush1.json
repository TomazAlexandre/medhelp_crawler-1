            "answer": "Hi,There is a small amount of Candida or fungus that lives in the mouth most of the time. However, when the immune system is weaker, the fungus can grow, leading to thrush. Have this evaluated by your doctor for proper management. Tests such as microscopic examination of mouth scrapings or culture of mouth lesions may be done. Treatment such as antifungal mouthwash\u00a0\u00a0or lozenges may be prescribed by your doctor.Take care and do keep us posted.",
