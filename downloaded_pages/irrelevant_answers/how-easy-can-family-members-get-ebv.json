            "answer": "I wouldn't be too worried over this.... I would consider staying away from this woman if she has an ACTIVE infection. If you and your son are tested... you should know that the majority of the population has a positive EBV titer (IGG), which is indicative of a past infection. If you have a current infection, then you simply need to rest, drink plenty of fluids and follow your physician's advice.If she has CFS and has been ill for over 6 months, I would have some compassion for her. Very few people who have this invisible illness get sympathy... trust me.",

    "question": "I have a neighbor that has EBV and she is so proud of it, loves for people to feel sorry for her, well in the last two months this girl has sleep with many, I mean many people, both boys and girls and loves to brag about it.\u00a0\u00a0She swears up and down that she can't give EBV to anyone but I have a friend who just got it from her and she says over and over that her doctor says she can't spread it which she can.\u00a0\u00a0I have been around her a lot before I knew she had this and so has my 7 year old son, I went and got a blood test for it last week and I am OK but what are the chances that my 7 year old son could get it from just being around her?\u00a0\u00a0I am so upset that she put me and my son at risk and has giving it to other people, I talk to one girl she was with and this girl is very sick, I told her to see her doctor and told her what to look for.\u00a0\u00a0I know of 9 people that hang out at the club house by my house that she has had sex with while she has a swallon splein.\u00a0\u00a0Thats how I found out she had it, she texted me saying it was confirmed her splein was swollan because of her EBV so I went online and read as much as I could about this and boy that is the last thing I need to add with my diabetes!\u00a0\u00a0I have had Diabetes for 27 years and I take very good care of myself..\u00a0\u00a0I don't need some selfesh person who hates the world to try and give me something like this.\u00a0\u00a0I guess my main question is what are the first symptoms of EBV, can a cold sore be a symptom?\u00a0\u00a0My son looks like he may have a cold sore and has never had anything like this in his life so I am worried to death!\u00a0\u00a0I made a appointment for him to see the doctor Monday.\u00a0\u00a0The other thing is how is someone like her stopped from spreading EVB?\u00a0\u00a0She thinks its a big Joke and swears you can't spread it.\u00a0\u00a0She lives in Lake Forest, CA.\u00a0\u00a0Again, how easy can a family member get it even though I tested Negitive for it last week?",
