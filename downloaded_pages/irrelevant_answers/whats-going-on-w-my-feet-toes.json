            "answer": "I would suggest getting tested for raynauds disease, which effects the circulation off the extremities, and can make the fingers and toes turn blue-purple.I am not a doctor, so please dont take my word for it, but raynauds disease could be a possibility, so i would be asking the doctor for a second opinion, instead off your doctor fobbing you off.Wishing you good luck, keep me posted,Nicola.",

            "answer": "In addition to Raynauds, which sounds like a definite possibility, you may want to make sure you don't have diabetes, which can affect circulation in the feet & that you don't have peripheral vascular disease or PVD, which can be hereditary and strike as early as teenage years (perhaps get a check of pedal pulses, doppler for blood flow in your lower extremities and blood cholesterol levels to see if it's high).",

            "answer": "Hi!Welcome to the MedHelp forum!There are a few possibilities like hypothyroidism, peripheral neuropathy like in diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and very cold external temperatures. One possible explanation is \u2018Raynaud\u2019s Syndrome\u2019, either the primary or the secondary variant. The secondary variant is associated with autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid, SLE or scleroderma). This disorder is characterized by episodic contraction of the blood vessels in the fingers and toes. If you smoke or take any drugs, then this purple/black discoloration can be due to them. The other possibility is peripheral vascular disease. You would need angiogram or color dopplar for this.Until you can arrange for investigations, try warm oil massage of calf and feet, for good blood circulation. Keep the legs raised to ensure proper blood supply. Keep the feet warm.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I've ALWAYS had super cold feet but lately I've noticed my toes turn purple sometimes. Yet when ever I press down on my toes- the normal color returns. Well- b/c I got so freaked out about this.. I went to the doctor & she basically said nothings wrong. :-/ (She never ran blood tests or anything like that.) What prompted me to write on here is b/c of what happened last night. I had 3 pairs of socks on (1 thick pair) & my feet were still ICE COLD. I even ran hot water over them but shortly after- they became ice cold again. I even wrapped myself up in a fleece blanket & had a down comforter over top. My feet were still freezing. It was 70 degrees in my house too. My feet ache sometimes too. They can almost look swollen & red. Idk what do to. I'm a 22 yr old female. 5'6\" 115-120 lbs. I don't have health insurance. Is this something I should be concerned about??? PLEASE HELP!!! Thanks:)",
