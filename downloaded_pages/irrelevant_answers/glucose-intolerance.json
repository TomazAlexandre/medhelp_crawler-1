            "answer": "\"Local GP not much help, anyone got any suggestions?\"I would definitely fire the GP and find an Endocrinologist, a diabetes specialist, for complete testing. Low glucose [blood sugar] can be dangerous and life threatening. Too low a person will go into diabetic coma. Some recover, some don't.As far has his weight, beer can raise glucose levels as does simple carbohydrates. The calories in beer will make one fat, get a \"beer belly\". Like asok mentioned, find a dietician/nutritionist. Not familiar with the UK but in the states they are usually found at hospitals or possibly the endo can refer your partner to one.",

    "question": "My partner has been trying to lose weight forever!. When I met him he was about 76 Kilos, 7 years later he is now 82. He is not very tall (5' 6'') so I guess he is about 2 stone over weight. He does not eat very much but unfortunately drinks too much. For a long time I have suspected he is 'glucose intolerant', in that even when he has carbohydrate available he goes shaky and experiences 'low' blood sugar symptoms. For the amount he eats I think he should be able to have more success with weight loss. Even when I have got him to exercise weight loss is very slow and not as it should be. We have has some success with the Atkins diet but again, not great. Local GP not much help, anyone got any suggestions?",
