            "answer": "Hi,Here's the thing with diabetic pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0The\u00a0\u00a0insulin resistance keeps increasing (so blood sugar keeps getting harder to control) as the pregnancy progresses.You will need to increase your meal time insulin, if you are going high.\u00a0\u00a0Sprite is pure sugar; you need to avoid all soft drinks and sugars.Controlling how much carb you eat / Lower carb is really important during pregnancy to be able to control how high your sugars go.\u00a0\u00a0You may need to increase the veges and meats and reduce the breads further.\u00a0\u00a0I found I had to eat very low carb (in addition to using lots of insulin) in order to control my blood sugars when I was pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Your baby doesn't know how much carb you eat, but what affects it is your blood sugar levels.Do you know how to count carbs and match the insulin to the carbs?For example, if you are going to eat 30 g of carb at 1 meal, then you need to know how many units of insulin will cover that.\u00a0\u00a0It may be 1 unit of insulin covers 10 g of carbs?\u00a0\u00a0or maybe 1 unit covers 5 g of carb.\u00a0\u00a0During pregnancy this will continue to change and you will continue to need more insulin.Has your dr instructed you how to do corrections with insulin. For example, when I am high, I know that 1 unit of insulin will bring my blood sugar down by 10 points.\u00a0\u00a0Then if I am 150 at 3 hours after eating, I will correct.Your basal insulin (the levemir) will also need to be increased as the pregnancy progresses.Please ask your doctor about all of the points raised here.Also, you may find that exercise (walking or other exercise for 30 minutes) after eating, helps to bring down your sugars as well.Hope it helps.\u00a0\u00a0The efforts will be worth it.It is possible to control blood sugar to the degree they want, but only if you understand how to use insulin to it's full advantage.You can get the following books which may help, as they describe how to use and adjust insulin doses:-Think Like a PancreasUsing INsulin - John WalshDiabetes Solutions - Dr. BernsteinHopefully your dr. can refer you to a diabetes educator who can teach you further how to adjust and use insulin.",

            "answer": "Hon,You need to eat heaps more fat and protein, and really restrict the carbs.Fat has zero impact on blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Protein has minimal effect and much slower than that of carbs.For example.\u00a0\u00a01 bread (ok), but also 3 or 4 slices of ham, and a couple of slices of cheese, and add some green salad.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or skip the bread altogether and make a huge salad with meat, greens, cheese, and dressing.Avocado is a great source of fat and highly nutritious.\u00a0\u00a0It is also filling.Use your peanut butter (no sugar added, I hope), as a dip for vegetable sticks.Eggs.\u00a0\u00a0Very good!\u00a0\u00a0Omlete or quiche is great with added cheese and veges.\u00a0\u00a0You can even beat the egg with some cream (gives a great texture).\u00a0\u00a0It can also be an option for lunch.\u00a0\u00a0Quiche can keep for several days in the fridge and save you having to cook every day.Hope this helps.Roast chicken (eat the skin as well), and green veges.",

            "answer": "You need to increase your meal time insulin dose already.3 units may no longer be enough.\u00a0\u00a0You may need to increase to 5 units or more.\u00a0\u00a0Please contact your dr about this asap.My doctor let me adjust my own insulin.\u00a0\u00a0He said when consistently high for more than 2 meals increase by 1 - 2 units of meal time insulin and observe.Same for the fasting insulin. If I was higher than the target for 2 days running he had me increase the long acting insulin by 1 - 2 units.\u00a0\u00a0If still high after 2 more days increase by another 1 - 2 units.This will be a time of rapid change and you will need to keep adjusting your insulin levels to match.I still recommend advocado.\u00a0\u00a0it is high in healthy fats and very nutritious.\u00a0\u00a0You just need to take insulin to cover what you are eating.",
