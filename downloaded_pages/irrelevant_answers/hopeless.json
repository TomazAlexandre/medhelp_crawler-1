            "answer": "I have been experiencing the same symptoms you have with your scalp and hair loss for the past 5 years. I currently have patches of bald spots from the hair loss and don't go anywhere without a hat. It's humiliating. My scalp is extremely itchy at night. Bad. I keep telling my family dr. and he does nothing for it, no tests, nothing, just says I have alopecia areata. My hair texture also changed when the hair loss started and I really want answers. I feel hopeless that I will ever have a normal head of hair and stop itching. Plz let me know if the neem shampoo or anything you\u00a0\u00a0have tried has helped you. Thanks and best of luck.",
