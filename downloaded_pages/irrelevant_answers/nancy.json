            "answer": "Don't under estimate the knowledge of an ENT.\u00a0\u00a0My ENT was the one who got my Hashimoto's diagnosed because my pcp refused to help me - based on TSH levels.........\u00a0\u00a0My ENT was the one who referred me to an endo when my pcp refused........A lot of endocrinologists specialize in diabetes, but know very little about thyroid, even though it's also an endocrinology issue.......Pick the one who is willing to test for TSH, FT3, FT4 and antibodies - that's the one who will most likely help you the most.........",
