            "answer": "Interesting post. \"Do these symptoms even sound like diabetes?\" Could be a yes, or a no, or somewhere in-between. Could be what meniere135 said about gluten intolerance. Hard to say as you left off critical information. For example, when you say, \"Doctors say, you've been tested, you're fine...\" leads me to believe you've seen at least two doctors if not more. Yes? What type of doctors - PCP, Endocrinologist, Gastroenterologist? What diabetes tests were performed and the results?\u00a0\u00a0Be exact and specific when posting test results. Keeps us from guessing the test... smiling... and will give us a clue if your issues are diabetes related.",

            "answer": "You are Carb intolerant.Try a low carb diet, lots of lean protein, vegetables and nuts,seeds...A good indicator of how well you tolerate carbs are skinfold measurements. Get your suprailiac and subscapular skinfold measured. If suprailiac is over 8mm you eat to much carbs, if subscapular is over 5-6 you are geneticaly not supposed to eat carbs.",

    "question": "I am a 38 yo female, 5'2\" 100 pounds. I just found out my birthfather died from complications of juvenile diabetes at the age of 35. I have been tested throughtout the years, as have my two daughters, but always comes back normal. I have heart PAC's and PVC's that have been monitored. I feel absolutely terrible after I eat. Usually it's 2-3 hours afterwards. I feel shaky, my heart will race, I feel lightheaded like I may faint. I do notice it's worse after I eat a lot of carbs, so I try to stay away from those. Any suggestions? Doctors say, you've been tested, you're fine...but I don't feel fine. Do these symtpms even sound like diabetes? Thanks so much!",
