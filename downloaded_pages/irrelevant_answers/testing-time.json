            "answer": "Dear,I have done yet another test at 49 days. And did the test at 2 different laboratories and both proved negative tests.Should that be conclusive about HIV?Because I am still feeling much fatigue, have some muscular pains and my inner chest and abdomen seems to be burning a little. I also have very little burning sensation while urinating. Very mild.Am 25 years old.I did a Diabetes test = ok. I did a cholesterole test which happens to be less than 50.I dunno what to think about and what to do. I am worried about this situation.I am normal man. Very athletic.Should be 49 days test for HIV be conclusive?What that could be?I cannot understand.Are these sysmtoms of HIV?Thank you very much Kumar007 for your time",

            "answer": "Morning,The key feature about this Forum is that we individually address the facts that are presented to us rather than just giving a generic - yes/no approach. So you will get some variation in what Jose and I say.99% of people will form antibodies to HIV 1 and 2 by 6 weeks. In the EU the rapid tests are licensed for conclusive results after 12 weeks - however we know that they are better than that - hence the apparent conflict between what Jose says and what I have said.If you were to have a very very high risk exposure - ie being a gay man who had had receptive anal sex with ejaculation by the other person into the rectum and that person was known to be an untreated HIV positive then I would recommend testing either with a DUO repeat at 8 weeks or a rapid test at 12 weeks - although I would not anticipate the result changing - just healthy paranoia. Hope that explains things.best regards, Sean Cummings",
