            "answer": "I have only recently started taking cialis, from the past 3 months. I consulted a urologist and told him about ED he prescribed paxil, but that didnt help. so i was put on cialis. The doctor also performed a penile test and established the fact that the blood flow was found to be normal after injecting in the penis. Cialis has certainly helped but the effects are not the same always. Kindly suggest what to do,please.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that there is something that can help me.Thank you.",
