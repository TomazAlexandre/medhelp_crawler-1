            "answer": "I'm confused. MBredin said \"11.0\" as his blood glucose reading. Then SuperSally replied 11 (180). Which was it? A 180 reading for me is VERY HIGH and of course 11 is almost a coma reading. Can someone tell me if you are talking about a regular reading from a glucometer. I was hospitalized earlier this year when my reading in the ER was 14. They were amazed I was even conscious. I had been passing out at home.",
