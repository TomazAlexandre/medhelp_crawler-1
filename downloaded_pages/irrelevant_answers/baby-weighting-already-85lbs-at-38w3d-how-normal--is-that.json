            "answer": "I am on the same boat as you...I have had all the testings and they all came back fine.. i always measured fine by my due date until yesterday i found out at fundal measurement appoint that i was measuring about 2 weeks ahead.. than i had U/S today and baby is weighing 4.18lb at 31wks.. I m hoping it will level up in next few weeks... but if it didnt i ll have to go for another U/S and see what doctors will suggests... it is also on the average but at 90% centile ... i always measured 10%centile... and it happened with in 3wks.. the only theory i got so far is that baby had growth spurt so it should be fine.. i have appointment on 29 with midwife i m hoping to get more information on that...i have also read that sometimes u/s readings can be inaccurate and baby could be in normal range..",

            "answer": "Yeah? Ive had ultrasounds everytime Ive been to the doc (normal in the two countries ive lived during this pregnancy) and in some the baby has been like a week or 2 ahead of weight but the doctors have always said \"its fine\". Now what I just remembered is that when I got pregnant I didnt know my exact date of conception cause i was very irregular.... so what if this whole time my fetus has actually been 2 weeks older than I thought? Regardless, I just hope its not gestational diabetes, cause that would suck :(",

            "answer": "I'm 34 weeks and at my 32 weeks appt my doctor said my son was on the larger side as well. They were saying he was measuring at 34 weeks, 2 weeks ahead of how i far i really was. They made me take another glucose test to rule a GD again but it came back normal. She said theres nothing wrong with a big baby however I MAY have to have a c section depending how big he gets closer to my due date. i have an appt 36 weeks to check his growth spurt again. He could be normal size but on the u/s he had a large head and abdomen so it could go either way. It ***** that you werent tested for GD at 28 weeks like you were suppose to",

            "answer": "I know right? well i was not in the US (still not there btw) and the doctor said that since nothing shows on any other tests or in my family history that i might have GD, that she didnt feel it was necessary for me to get the test done. Im just hoping the baby ate too much by the time she had the ultrasound done :S omg and to think I have to wait till neeeeext week, this is a torture",

    "question": "So yeah as the title says Im having a big baby which is weird since me and my husband are not big nor tall at all. The doc said that since the baby's belly is a little bigger than usual (still on the \"average\" curve but on the bigger side) that it MIGHT be gestational diabetes but we dont know since my first doctor didnt check for it and now its too late. Im getting so worried because of this! and the weird part is that 2 and a half weeks ago I had an ultrasound and my doc said everything was fine with the baby so in these 2 weeks suddenly the baby is more plump!What do you girls think? would a big baby be normal even if no one in my family has had this problem before? or GD (same, no one in my fam ever had this problem before).",
