            "answer": "We are not allowed to post web links on this forum. If you use Google to search on the 'Glycemic Index', the GI will explain the differences between simple and complex carbs. Besides sugar, simple carbs are a diabetics worst enemy as they quickly raise glucose [blood sugar] levels.Fruits must be eaten with other foods to slow the absorption of fructose [fruit sugar]. Caution with tropical fruits as they contain large amounts of fructose - pineapple, mangoes, papayas. Berries are healthier.Also use Google to locate the ADA [American Diabetes Association] web page, click Food & Fitness for an abundance of recipes. Care must be taken, however, as not all foods can be eaten by all diabetics. Even though the ADA list specific foods first discuss with grandmother about foods that may affect her glucose levels in a negative manner.HTH",
