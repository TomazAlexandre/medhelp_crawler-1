    "question": "Approximately 3 weeks ago I had unprotected oral sex with a sp which lasted approximately 1 minute.4 days after this encounter, the tip of my urethra was irritated and looked slightly red on one side and felt an intermittent slight burning/stinging sensation in my urethra. Some days it was ok, some I felt the irritation. I passed a gonorrhea/chlamydia urine test which came back negative. I went back to the doctor and was given a cream (mixture of cortisone and clotrimaderm) which I used for several days but didn't change anything.I went back and was prescribed Loprox which I applied 2 times a day for 4 days. The irritation redness subdued and the burning/stinging went away.Now the skin below the glans feels irritated and sometimes feel a burning sensation, mostly on the top and right side. I'm not sure if it's the rim of the glans that's irritated or the skin just beneath it. I see no evidence of irritation, the skin isn't red or anything but the sensation is still there. I stopped applying the Loprox yesterday since I know this can cause a burning sensation. The sensation is still slightly there though.If I pull the foreskin down and leave it like that for a while, it seems to relieve the sensation for some reason. I don't know if it's because the area was very moist for a prolonged period of time because of the lotion and got irritated because of it?",
