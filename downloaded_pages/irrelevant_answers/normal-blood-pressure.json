            "answer": "Normal blood pressure should be no higher than 120/80, especially in those with a history of heart disease or those with multiple CV risk factors such as diabetes. Of the blood pressure medications you listed, Losartan and Norvasc are medications often used to treat blood pressure. Having a lower than normal blood pressure is not dangerous unless there are associated symptoms (light-headedness, fatigue, dizziness, etc.).\u00a0\u00a0If experienced, you should speak with her cardiologist/physician about titrating her medications appropriately.Of note, one medication that she should also be on is a beta blocker (given her history of unstable angina).\u00a0\u00a0There may be reasons why this was not started (extremely low heart rate, conduction disease, allergy, etc), but should be addressed by her physician.",
