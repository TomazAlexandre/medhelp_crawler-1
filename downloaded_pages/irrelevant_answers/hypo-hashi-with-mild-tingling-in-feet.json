            "answer": "Hi Rohot_786, I really appreciate your post!! I've been wondering what (or what else)is wrong with me, due to the tingling in my feet! I do have some numbness, but only in my hands and only in the morning. Also, sometimes both of my hands fall asleep while I'm asleep in bed. I was told the hand symptoms as possibily carpal tunnel due to hypothyroid. Someone recently suggested tingling feet might be pre-diabetes, but my glucose is normal, and no one in my family has diabetes. My weight is close to normal. I've been hoping the tingling feet was due to thyroid and high tsh (5.3).\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for posting! Good luck with your health!! We all need it!",

Its seems like many others with hypo/hashi also have tingling and numbness due to high tsh and thyroid!!! My endo MD has told me to wait until my tsh is lower before I consult with a neurologist, but is VERY easy to worry when one has symptoms that seem neurological!! It's a relief to know that other hypo/hashi suffers have the same \"strange\"symptoms like tingling and numbness. The tingling in my feet was the first symptom that I developed when I became hypo, so maybe it will be the last to leave.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you again for sharing this information!!!!",

            "answer": "Wow, I was excited to read all your comments! I've had hypothyroidism for the last 5 years which has recently flipped to hyperthyroidism. A few months prior, I began having similar symptoms as you guys- tingling, numbness especially in my face and leg. As well, I have had a great deal of difficulty swallowing although my endo says my thyroid is not enlarged even slightly.\u00a0\u00a0He has been changing my thyroid medicine and has nearly got my levels to normal, however, the problems persist. I have seen several neurologists and almost all tests came back normal expect my SPECT scan which showed an abnormal blood flow to my brain.I would be very interested in hearing how everyone has dealt with these problems and what if anything your doctors are suggesting/doing to help. Thank you all for sharing- its great to know that I'm not the only one!",

            "answer": "Hi Mel38, Any info about the experiences of others is very useful! I'll definitely post a follow up about the tingling feet issue. Other than thyroid antibodies and high tsh, my blood tests appear normal. I've seen an orthopedist and did back films which were also normal,so it's not back/disc related. I haven't seen an neurologist yet. Most MDs say wait until tsh down to back to normal. The tingling feet was the first symptom that I developed, so maybe it will be the last symptom to resolve. By the way, I also used to have a bit of mild tingling in my back and shoulders at night but that seems to have stopped! I still have other more comon hypo symptoms, so I'm obviously, not well yet. I just started 75 mcg, so time and patience...lots of patience. Good luck!",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with hashi/hypo 3 months. I have mild tingling in my feet sometimes. My B12 is not low. Someone recently mentioned this might be a symptom of pre-diabetes. Should I be concerned about developing diabetes? No family history of diabetes. My Glucose is 96 (still in normal range), my B12 is high: 1253 (due to vitamin intake which I've stopped), My calcium is 10.3 (still normal); my Rheumatoid 5.7 (normal). After 2 months on 50 synthroid my TSH is down to 5.3. Could tingling feet be from hypo thyroid? Or might I be heading for diabetes? Or something else? MD just increased synthroid to 75.",
