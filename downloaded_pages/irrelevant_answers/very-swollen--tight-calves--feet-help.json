            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Since you have both diabetes and Hashimotos and have calf pain, swelling and heat, there are two things to be ruled out immediately. One is deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and atherosclerosis of calf blood vessels should also be looked into by angiograms or color dopplars. DVT can be dangerous if clot moves and lodges in heart, brain or lung. The other is cellulitis and infection under the skin. Both are potentially dangerous problems.Heart, kidney and liver function should also be assessed. Please discuss with your treating doctor immediately. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for responding quickly!\u00a0\u00a0I will take your advice, first thing Monday morningI will contact my doctor. Also I forgot to mention that when he gave me the prescription for theDiuretic & potassium. He also had me get compression socks that are knee high. I don't like them, they hurt like the dickens putting them on. But then for about 2 to 4 hours they feel pretty good. They they start killing me! They start to roll down a little bit from the knee and cut off my circulation off. But when my calves come down a little bit after I have elevated them. They remind me of memory foam you know like when you squeeze gently down it comes back up ever soooo slowly. But you still see your finger prints in it. That's what my calves look like when I put them down from elevating them.Again thank you again...........",
