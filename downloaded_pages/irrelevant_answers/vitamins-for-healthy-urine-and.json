            "answer": "Hi,Firstly, a healthy (that is a normal ) urine is possible if there are no underlying structural abormalities and if there are no underlying systemic disease like hypertension and diabetes. Given that these were excluded, a balanced diet and daily intake of at least 8-10 glasses of water each day will ensure not just a healthy urine but also a healthy body.At this point, cranberry juice has been proven by some studies to decrease the risk of UTI because it prevents binding of certain organisms to the lining of the bladder wall. Vitamin C is an antioxidant and aside from improving circulation and healing (good for the hair and skin) it also acidifies the urine and thus help destroy bacteria.",
