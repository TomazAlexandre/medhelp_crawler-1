    "question": "Maybe once every 2-3 weeks I will have a very quick (basically an instant) amount of discomfort while urinating. Generally, this occurs if I \"push\" while urinating (which I do for no particular reason) and I am usually dehydrated - I urinate frequently when I am hydrated - this has gone on my entire life. Any idea, though, why I experience the slight discomfort occasionally? Could it be std related?",
