            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0Frozen shoulder is a condition that causes restriction of motion in the shoulder joint. It causes pain on all movements of the joint and pain may be felt over the outer part of shoulder and upper arm. For reasons poorly understood, the capsule surrounding the shoulder joint contracts and forms scar tissue. The treatment is by combination of exercises, anti-inflammatory, cortisone injections, physical therapy and application of moist heat (not ice). If this does not help then you may be taken up for manipulation of the joint under anesthesia or for arthroscopy to release the scar tissue.Usually clinical exam is enough to diagnose the condition, but if you have a doubt, please talk to your doctor. MRI can be done for a confirmed diagnosis. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

She did not feel my muscles were in danger.I feel so much better after your answer.Thank you againD",

I ended up with frozen shoulder in the other arm in Aug 2014.\u00a0\u00a0While I was able to get it partially moving, it was never the same. I could not raise my arms above my head. I did get an MRI for the second \"frozen shoulder\" and was diagnosed with labral tear, tendinitis, bursitis, I was a mess but was told at my age, this was to be expected. PT was recommended again.I did the PT with the second just like the first.In March 2017 I had a deep tissue massage. The pain went away after that massage; for the first time since 2014 I am able to raise my arm above my head.I wanted to come back to share in case there is someone else suffering.I feel very blessed to be able to once again be able to use my arms.",

    "question": "Hello, about 5 months ago I started having problems when I would reach forward in a sudden movement and suffer excruiating pain in the bicep.\u00a0\u00a0I thought I had injured in a fall so started ice, heat, ultrasound, etc.Then the pain started happening in the shoulder when I would reach behind me.\u00a0\u00a0I just thought it was spreading, It worsened over time until it seemed to be hurting all the time.I went to a chiropractor who thought I had ripped the labrum and possibly rotator cuffs, he advised an MRI.\u00a0\u00a0I was sent to an orthopedic yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0Upon examination he determined that I had a frozen shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0He admitted that it was not really known how these started however I do have diabetes (which I read is 3 times more likely to get a frozen shoulder).\u00a0\u00a0He said I do not need an MRI as he knows my shoulder is frozen.His answer for me is to start physical therapy to break up the adhesion's and scar tissue.\u00a0\u00a0I am trying to find out as much information as I can.\u00a0\u00a0While I understand the pain starts then a person slowly loses their range of motion but wonder why this happens and where the pain comes from.\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone help me with more information?Is ice or heat better? Can ultrasound help? I am starting PT this morning and am nervous as to how much this will hurt.\u00a0\u00a0Oh he gave me a cortisone shot as well.\u00a0\u00a0While I am happy it is not ripped, I do have some fear that if he is wrong I will be making it worse.Thank you for an advice",
