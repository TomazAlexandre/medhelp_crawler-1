            "answer": "I am taking cipro too. It is strong medicine, i took it for 9 days already. It doesn't help too much with my symptom. it make me sick. I feel my mouth is so dry and i need tons of water. after i took water then i need to run to bathroom every twenty minutes.My doc is on vacation. yesterday night i was very axious too. Uti is not big problem, but it do make me feel bad.Since worry doesn't help too much. therefore, I think we should calm ourself down, then sort some help from doctor. I don't think any symptom will go away without treatment, anxiety really do make thing worse.",

            "answer": "Do you hurt any place else besides while you are going pee? I really think that you are making yourself go a lot because you are thinking about it so much. Just like all of\u00a0\u00a0our other anxiety problems we obsess about them and it makes things 10 times worse. When you go to the bathroom do you go a lot each time, or a little bit? I go to the bathroom all day long, but I live in florida and drink about 64+ ounces of water a day because I get kidney stones. I actually have a 3mm in right kidney right now. Waiting for it to pass.",
