            "answer": "Have you never been to your doctor with this problem to get your blood checked out?If not, then you should go and see a doctor as soon as possible.With you thirsting for blood, seems that you are extremely anaemic.Also such unquenchable thirst can also indicate that you are suffering from diabetes.A simple blood test will confirm whether you do suffer from any form of anaemia and also if you suffer from diabetes.If you are found to be deficient in iron and the group of Vitamin Bs the doctor will be able to prescribe you the appropriate medication.\u00a0\u00a0If you are lacking in B12, you may need to have a course of injections of these.For diabetes, you may be monitored and sent to a dietician with regard to controlling you blood sugars through diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0If the diabetes is more advanced, the doctor would put you on either tablets or insulin injections.\u00a0\u00a0They usually start people off on tablet medications and see how you get on.\u00a0\u00a0If by tablets and diet your sugar levels are not controlled, your doctor may put you on to insulin.The thing with water, although it is good to drink a lot, and 2-3 litres per day is usually recommended, more if it is hot or you sweat and do workouts, drinking an excess of water can also be as dangerous as being dehydrated.Hope you see your doctor as soon as you can so that they find out the problem and treat you appropriately.Let me know how you get on.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "Well, evidently, I have a \"perfect bill of health\".I'm not diabetic, and my iron content is more or less \"normal\".The only thing is that the doctor told me to avoid being in direct sunlight, because that only makes everything even worse, even if I'm not active, and avoid as much of the things I'm allergic/intolerant to as I possibly can (not that I didn't know that, in the first place).But I also have to eat as much red meat (basically anything that can be eaten either rare or relatively 'raw' as I can get. Apparently, blood is the \"Nuber-One\" thing that will keep me perfectly healthy, so whenever I have the chance, I need to eat a rare steak or else find a place that sells \"edible beef blood\", and drink that. Apparently, I'll still be thirsty, but it won't be anywhere near as bad.I still can't believe how stumped the doc looked, this morning. I told him that I hadn't slept, and when he came back with the test results, he just looked at me and said \"I can see why you can't sleepo at night\".Not that most of the following is any news to Me, but he called me out on literally EVERYTHING I hide from the public. I still can't believe he is this smart.1) On a good day, even when I feel weak, I can easily pick up more than five hundred pounds, without breaking a sweat, and I'm even stronger at night,2) my reflexes are almost unnatural, as is my natural/physical speed,3) I evidently heal WAY too quickly to be diabetic,4) my fingernails look like cloudy glass, yet are still strong (I have no idea why he brought that up),5) I can see in the dark better than most people can see in the light (natural night-vision)And to top everything off, most drugs like tranquilizers don't work on me, and even caffeine doesn't affect me. Evidently, my shallow breath, yet relatively \"normal\" heart ratespooks the daylights\" out of the doc.All things considered, I evidently, should not be anywhere near as strong, fast, or as agile as I am. Let alone, should I heal as quickly as I do. (Both my own research and the doctor told me that diabetics are Really Slow in their healing. So that is evidently ruled out. The only thing that seems to really bother him is what looks and feels like a mobile cist below my belt line, which may or may not have to be spliced open, or surgically removed, or it \"may cause sterility\", which I have a feeling I'm already sterile, as it is. I'm having to wait to see if it's actually detrimental, since I've had it for a few years, now.)",

            "answer": "Well that is good news that you are healthy and do not have diabetes.Yes, it is true that people with diabetes who have skin problems heal very slowly.\u00a0\u00a0I am glucose intolerant and I have the same problem with slow healing of wounds.With you saying that your iron level is \"more or less normal\", then it sounds that you are on the low end of \"normal\".Good thing that you like to eat rare steaks and drink good beef blood.Liver and kidneys contain a lot of iron and dark greens.Hope you get on OK with your cyst.\u00a0\u00a0Hope you do not have to wait too long for an appointment.\u00a0\u00a0What makes you think that you are sterile?

    "question": "I know this is going to sound crazy, or like I have some twisted mental problem, but \"whatever\", I guess. I just need an answer, so I can get this off my mind, after seven years.I am always thirsty, to the point of feeling parched, and water never really did anything, and over the years, it seems that straight water only makes me feel ill. I found out, while out with some friends, that for some weird reason, I always feel more than 100% better, after drinking blood of some kind, which I've learned I crave almost like some kind of drug. Evidently, that's where my constant thirst ends, and after drinking, I feel perfectly refreshed.I learned this when I was fifteen, and I'm twenty-two, now. Almost twenty-three.I also begin to feel somewhat sick, like I have the flu, until I drink either blood or wine, or I have to smoke almost profusely, to get the sick feeling to stop. I hide it remarkably well, but it still shows if I'm talking to people, face-to-face, and they see my skin turn almost sickly pale. It goes away, for a little bit, but never for long, and every time it comes back, I feel more and more thirsty, as if I haven't drank anything for several days on end.I've been looking for answers to this, for over five years, and I still can't find anything that makes \"logical\" sense.",
