            "answer": "Hello,as you are vegetarian and most vegetarian foods are carbs, it can be difficult to control blood sugar just by reducing carbs.Your HBA1c is increasing and your fasting blood sugar is well above normal.\u00a0\u00a0From your HBA1C I think your sugars are also high the rest of the day.\u00a0\u00a0Normal HBA1C should be 4.3 - 4.6 (non diabetic) and for persons with diabetes should be as close to normal as possible and ideally < 6.0.Ideally fasting blood sugar is < 95 (ideally 80s).2 hours after eating blood sugar should be ideally < 120.You can test fasting, then 2 hours after every meal (or fasting then before lunch and before dinner) - maybe try this on alterntiave days - to see how high your sugars are and if they are staying high.\u00a0\u00a0You could also test 2 hours after eating (try eating differnety meals) to see which foods do and don't make your sugars high.\u00a0\u00a0Then avoid those foods which raise your blood sugars.My advice is to reduce any fast acting carbs - this would mean replacing things like rice , breads, fruits, with vegetable (except corn and potato) and slower acting carbs such as lentils. Avoid sugar in all added forms. Try to eat more protein and fats (so that you have enough calories for your energy).\u00a0\u00a0Exercise after every meal (ie. walking) may also help reduce blood sugars.Please also talk to your Dr about your meds.\u00a0\u00a0Your glucomet is only at 500 a day? Am I correct?\u00a0\u00a0There is room to increase this dose further.\u00a0\u00a0If this does not get your blood sugars down a low dose of insulin may be an option.\u00a0\u00a0To keep you healthy and avoid complciations, it is very important to normalise blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Your HBA1C is nearly 7 and indicates that you do need to take more efforts (both lifestyle and meds) to reduce it.Hope this can be helpful.",
