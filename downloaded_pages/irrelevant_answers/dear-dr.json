            "answer": "Hi, you should consult Neurologist. Do you get some vision problems too? These kind of symptoms although vague but could be related to multiple sclerosis, diabetes, TIA etc. Are you hypertensive? Another possibility is vitamin B deficiency, peripheral blood smear along with serum vitamin B levels will prove to be helpful.Please get your blood glucose and blood pressure checked. MRI brain will help to pin point brain pathology, if any.",
