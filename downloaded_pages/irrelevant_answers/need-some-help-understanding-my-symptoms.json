            "answer": "The symptoms you report are diffuse and do not allow me to localize them very well to one particular area of the nervous system. I assume your blood work included tests for thyroid disease, B12 levels, folate levels, and diabetes. The normal EMG has excluded damage to the large nerve fibers. However, there are conditions during which the small nerve fibers (typically carrying pain sensations) can be damaged. To document this a special quantitative sensory test would be required. Unfortunately without examining you I cannot determine if this is neurologic or if specific testing is required. The list of possible diagnoses is quite long and more information would be required to narrow the list. I understand you do not have insurance at this point. I would encourage you to contact your local health board and determine if there are free health clinics in the area. Good luck.",

            "answer": "Did you take any drug the months prior to your symptoms? For instance, statins (for lowering cholesterol), some antibiotics (quinolones like levaquin and cipro), lariam (for malaria), and many other drugs are responsible of over two thirds of the non traumatic, non surgical neuropaties.",

            "answer": "Heh, the US with its private health services.. All the world is running jokes on that. If you dont have the money, its bye bye for you. Well, to the point, tingling and sensation of needles or burn in your feet and hands could be the result of irregularities in your bloodflow to those areas. There is a check for that, I believe, but I AM NOT A DOCTOR.",

    "question": "I am a 37 year old female.\u00a0\u00a0About a year ago I started to experience some strange sensations.\u00a0\u00a0It began with tingling in my fingers.\u00a0\u00a0Every so often I will have a pulsating feeling in my hands and fingers, like there is electricity going through them.\u00a0\u00a0This is not consistent however.\u00a0\u00a0I did have an EMG done and this was negative - nothing wrong.\u00a0\u00a0I also had a full blood and urine analysis and nothing was wrong.\u00a0\u00a0What is worse and seems to be more consistent is this tingling in both my legs and trunk areas.\u00a0\u00a0It will come on after I have been walking and sometimes will stop after about a half hour or more and sometimes it is consistent throughout the day.\u00a0\u00a0I also have been having some stiffness in my lower back.\u00a0\u00a0The reason I am turning to this forum is that I have lost my job, due to a merger of companies,\u00a0\u00a0and no longer have medical insurance and therefore am unable to go see a doctor because I simply cannot afford it.\u00a0\u00a0I am not looking for a diagnosis, just some advise as to what you think may be going on with me and if I should be concerned that this is something that could be serious.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate any feedback you are able to give me at this time - thank you",
