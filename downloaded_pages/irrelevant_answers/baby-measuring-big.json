I didn't understand how because I knew when I ovulated but,\u00a0\u00a0they said baby measured bigger and it's correct.

            "answer": "I am 38+5 and my baby has been measuring big since 24w weeks. Due date has not changed at all. It could be from genetics that your baby is big (which is in my case) or from gestational diabetes. Which they will test for that between 24-28 weeks. Don't worry or stress too much.",
