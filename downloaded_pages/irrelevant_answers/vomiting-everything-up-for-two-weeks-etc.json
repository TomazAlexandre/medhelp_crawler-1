            "answer": "HI, you're still so young and 'm sorry to hear what you are going through. This may not be the only answer to your health issues but I'm sure that it could help. In your searches, I want to direct you to learn about Magnesium Deficiency. .. Here is one cut and paste:Magnesium Deficiency SymptomsMagnesium is a mineral responsible for 300 bodily processes. An anti-inflammatory mineral offering protection against illnesses like arthritis and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, magnesium has been used to remedy problems like high blood pressure, diabetes, respiratory issues, and much more. But as you may suspect, just as upping magnesium intake can solve problems, a magnesium deficiency could lead to many of those same issues and much more.Here are\u00a0\u00a0signs of a magnesium deficiency.Calcium deficiencyPoor heart healthWeaknessMuscle crampsTremorsNauseaAnxietyHigh blood pressureType II diabetesRespiratory issuesDizzinessFatiguePotassium deficiencyDifficulty swallowingPoor memoryConfusion+++\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SeizuresIBSColitisUnstable blood sugarHow to Safely Supplement MagnesiumIt\u2019s almost impossible to overdose magnesium by supplementing, but consuming too much magnesium is still not a great idea. Too much of the mineral could lead to some side effects like irregular heartbeat or slowed breathing. Similar to oral ascorbic acid C, there is a bowel tolerance threshold that brings on diarrhea if exceeded. Not all magnesium supplements are easily absorbed, either.\u00a0\u00a0Daily recommended Mg is 320 mg for women but more can be tolerated safely.You can find inexpensive products that feature magnesium glycinate, Citrate , which is among the most readily absorbed forms of magnesium supplements.You can also apply transdermal magnesium chloride (Spray) topically to be absorbed internally through the skin. Magnesium chloride is also known as magnesium oil, though not really an oil. It\u2019s a briny solution from ancient sea beds. It is available through various online sources. Google magnesium oil products.+++++++It is best to use both pills and the spray as it takes 6 to 12 months to get Mg levels to normal. The spray speeds up the process.Please do more readings on Magnesium Deficiency. It's possibly one of the root causes of so many of your health problems. Not saying all.\"the Magnesium Miracle \" book of Dr. Carolyn Dean is an excellent reading. I am sure it will help you take care of yourself by understanding what's going on why and when you're low on minerals esp. Magnesium.Take care. I hope you could do this after your procedures are done..It took many years for you to get here, so please be patient with Mg and give it time to get you better. It will also help you rest, get relaxed, sleep soundly and feel rested.I wish you well.",

            "answer": "I suggest that you start supplementation with Magnesium. It does not work right away, but it will at least be on the works while you are still searching. Of several of your issues, many of these will get started to be better.Mg Glycinate is $4.00 per bottle of 90 caps. I get mine from SwansonsVitamins.For dehydration, try coconut water, its natural body liquid replacement. Even said to be used intravenously for dehydration in the olden years.",

    "question": "Hi, I'm a 23 year old female with a list of medical problems that would go on for days. I suffer from Polycythemia Vera, Carcinoid Cancer, epilepsy, narcolepsy, anemia, hypoglycemia, ulcerative and lymphocytic colitis, crohns disease, mast cell disease........the list could just go on and on but ill stop there.\u00a0\u00a0Two weeks ago I went to my oncologist to get bled as us PV patients call it. They refused to bleed me even though my hemoglobin was way too high because they saw on my CBC I was severely dehydrated. They have me three large bags of fluid and tried to hospitalize me however I rejected because I had a scheduled emergency colonoscopy and upper endo that Friday. When I had my colonoscopy my blood sugar was so low they had to wait to take me back until my sugar came up to a normal level from sugar fluids. Biopsies came back last week showing a have severe inflammation all thought my intestines and I have severe colitis. Along with small polyps. Anyhow the real question is that I have been vomiting up even water for two weeks straight and I'm staying very fatigued, dizzy, loss of balance, blurry vision ( can't even read my phone!) and painful cramping. I went to the ER a few days ago because my GI said he couldn't get me in until aug 27th and I can't wait. I've lost 15 pounds so far from this. My regular doctor refused to even talk about it because he said he didn't want to \"step on my GI's toes\". The ER did a cat scan of my brain due to a concussion a couple of weeks prior from a hospital forcing me to walk out even though I could hardly stand. I kept telling the doc at the ER I wasn't nauseated it just comes up and I know to run for a safe place to vomit. They gave me some zofran and dilaudid and sent me home saying this was not a true emergency. They even gave me water to drink and I puked it up in less then 2 minutes with weird white tissue looking stuff. The nurse said it wasn't real vomit even after I explained that duh there's nothing in my system because I've been vomiting it all up for two weeks!!!\u00a0\u00a0I'm really sick, I'm really frustrated and feel hopeless right now. I'm so sick I can barely go to work or even get up. If anyone has any advice I'd really appreciate it. I'm not pregnant for sure and no evidence of HPylori or Barrett's esophagus. What do I do now??? Where do I go from here?",
