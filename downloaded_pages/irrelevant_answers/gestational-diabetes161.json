GD ***** but I would think you would want to get accurate results, not results that could potentially lead you to having GD un-diagnosed and lead to issues for not only you but also the baby! I got diagnosed and I hate it but I am healthier for my baby and myself! It is hard to change diet and exercise but GD is not the end of everything!",

Your decision, but honestly I would really talk to your dr and not change what you do regularly! Trying to beat/cheat the test isn't a good idea...beat the test because you are healthy and really don't have GD!",
