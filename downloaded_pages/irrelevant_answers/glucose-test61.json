If that comes back positive, you have to fast overnight and go to the lab in the morning, where they will test your blood over a period of a few hours. I had gestational diabetes in my last pregnancy. It's a tough diet to follow, but not life ending.",

We had the check up then I got my blood drawn so there wasn't much extra waiting around. It made me a little sick to my tummy, but not bad. I know a lot of women dread it, but it's really not a big deal.\u00a0\u00a0I've never had to do the 3 hour test so I don't know what it's like.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully you won't have to either.",
