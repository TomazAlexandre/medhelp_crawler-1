            "answer": "Hi and welcome,Whilst some of the symptoms you've mentioned may seem similar to what can happen from a neurological condition like MS, they are actually a different causation eg Maralgia Parasthtica is nerve entrapment or compression, commonly associated with excess weight, injury, pregnancy, Diabetes etcWhat you've described with your hands (numb, tingling, itchy, feel swollen without swelling) is more in line with nerve entrapment or compression too eg ulnar nerve, median nerve etc and possibly Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Tingling and numbness in your fingers or hand, especially your thumb and index, middle or ring fingers are common signs of Carpel tunnel..Viruses and infections that have been linked to the development of Bell's palsy, Bell's palsy occurs when the nerve that controls the facial muscles is swollen, inflamed, or compressed but exactly what causes it, is unknown. If it was temporary it's possibly connected to what happened prior (pain in my neck and shoulder along with pain under my earlobe where the ear separates from head) and afterwards (fever, chills, jerks)...Bumps or lumps in your mouth, high fever and all over body chills have no connection to MS, I originally thought your legs only jumping around 10 years ago sounded like it would of been related to what was also causing the fever and chills, 15-20 minutes is a long time frame, seizure is possible with the fever and 2 people holding them down didn't alter anything, though why just your legs is odd....What occurred back then may be completely unrelated to what's started happening now, if it's only when you are asleep it could be nocturnal myoclonus or periodic limb movement disorder but your saying its happening all the time, no matter your body position, awake or asleep, it's not voluntary like RLS and if the jerking is with that same over the top intensity it has totally got me stumped, someone else might know what it could possibly be..I'm running late so i can't go into the other thoughts i have but i hope this part helps.......JJ",

    "question": "Off and on for years, from about 02 on, I would have little bumps on the right side of my tongue, (I thought it was from hot coffee, I never really thought about it) and pain in my neck and shoulder along with pain under my earlobe where the ear separates from head. I would rub it with my right finger back and forth, not knowing what it was it had just become a part of my life and would come and goIn 2003 I had excruciating\u00a0\u00a0neck and shoulder pain on my right right side a massage helped it some. Then in May of 2006 that terrible neck and shoulder, returned on my right side and stayed for a month.On June 6 2006, I\u00a0\u00a0was struck with Bells Palsy on right side (my husband said he remembered somthing odd from the month before--In May-- that my face made an unusual grimace and dropped before his eyes and straighten up in a matter of seconds)\u00a0\u00a0its been ten years this past June.A month after the diagnosis, my legs began jump uncontrollable they would shake and move for 15-20 min and then sparadicly through the\u00a0\u00a0night (so bad my husband and daughter had to hold one each to make it stop to no avail)this would be accompanied with a high fever and body chills for a couple of nights a week aproximately 3weeks (Only at night) and then it stopped however, now, they jump at will no matter if I'm at home or not; my legs are unctrollabe.Over these past 10 years my speech will slur,toungue will quiver and feel numb, I forget the words I'm trying to say in mid speech and have to think of names of people and items I'll sit there starring at them or the item and will alternate my choice of words or refer to the person as \"You\".after a Hysterectomy in March,\u00a0\u00a0I woke up after surgery,\u00a0\u00a0with numbness on my right-- ring & middle fingers (which subsided after surgey--it went away two days later--) as well as, Maralgia Parasthtica right leg, I can't feel the rop of my thigh to knee cap feels like pins and needles, burning & numb as if I'm being electrocuted. I still suffer with it.In July of this year,my fingers were numb and tingling ( like right after surgey) started with ring finger on the right then to ring finger on left then to ring & middle on right to the same on left, now, all fingers-all 10, are numb tingle and feel tight to me. This happened over a span of a three to four week period.To top it all off my left ring and middle toe gets numb and tingles from time to time and I have stabbing feelings in my eyes.Over the past 5 years my skin has itched terribly for no reason, scalp, feet, hands and web of fingers. On occasion I scratch the top of my feet until they bleed:(\u00a0\u00a0(it comes and goes...)Now, over the years, to include right before surgery, I have had blood test's and show no signs of diabetes or hypertension.Overall I am tired when I wake up and I'm fatigued through the day, I have alternating weakness in my rotator cuffs and sometimes can't even lift my hands above my head.I am now 51...these symptoms\u00a0\u00a0started when I was 38. I am African American woman of mixed descent Irish/black if anyone knows how to helpNeedless to say, I now have depression \u00d710. I dont know what to do. No doctor knows what's wrong.",
