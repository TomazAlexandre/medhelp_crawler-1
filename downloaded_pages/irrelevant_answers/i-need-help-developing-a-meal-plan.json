            "answer": "You have the key to the answer when you say you need a meal plan that suits YOUR life, not anyone elses. Just the same as weight loss diets, if your diabetes diet is such that you won't stick to it, it won't do you any good! Please learn about what foods are high and low in carbs and begin to find things that are lower in carbs that you enjoy. This would include eggs, cheese, meat, fish, fresh vegies, nuts, etc. To figure out what works for you in terms of carbs, please try various meals that you like and then test two hours after you ate and see if you are under 140. If not, then either the particular foods or the amounts of those foods need change. Just to give you an idea things that will jack most people's blood sugar are bread, rice, potatoes, cereal and of course sugar. Also if you exercise regularly that will make a difference in your blood sugar. And losing and then maintaining a healthy weight will make a huge difference as well in your insulin resistance.",

            "answer": "Excellent advice, Zoelula.My own two cents worth is to strive for consistency, at least at first. Get a good idea hgow you handle, for example, a single apple. Then try a single banana. Then try a portion of meat, perhaps a quarterpound on two slices of whole wheat bread. Nothing else. Check glucose levels two hours later. If you are injectables, figure out exactly how much is needed. Get some data. Everyone is a bit different due to weight and metabolism and the stage of the disease.Set up some \"model\" meals of foods that you like in reasonable quantities, test before the meal and two hours afterwards. Become accustomed to \"knowing\" about how many carbs/calories you take in. Take lots of blood sticks.I can't lecture you, but you have to come to terms with the fact that if you don't use a little self-discipline terrible things lie ahead. Goblins in the forest with big fangs and nasty smiles. Scary things that go bump in the night.There are many excellent free diabetic clinics that have nurse practicioners, nutritionists or RN's who are expert in helping you set up a program.If you need additional incentive there is a web site of images of \"diabetic foot\" you can look at.",

            "answer": "It is important to find a doctor you like and for me at least, that would not include one who made me feel bad about myself! Ok, so you haven't been managing your diabetes well, and like caregiver says, that put you at risk of all kinds of ugly complications. But today is a new day and you are here and you are ready! So start by getting a meter and keeping records and doing experiments on yourself to see what works and what doesn't. Too much of anything is of course too much, but do separate what you need to do for your diabetes and what you need to do to lose weight. Weight loss is important of course, but one step at a time. If you lower your carb intake to control your blood sugars you will probably lose weight in the process. No, you can't solve all your health problems with the click of a button but it is a start and good for you for being willing to start the process. I am sending you a private message with a couple websites where there are more diabetics of both types and people working on similar issues to you will help and support you. (WebMD doesn't allow posting them in the forum).Zoe",

            "answer": "There is a good book titled \"There is a Cure for Diabetes\" by Gabriel Cousins, M.D., a proponent of Green Live-Food cuisine. It outlines what Dr. Cousins calls the tree of life 21 day program. Essentially, plant source, or vegan diet, together with caloric restriction and moderate regular exercise.I am not about to endorse the thesis of this book, which I take with a grain of salt. Maybe yes. Maybe no.On the other hand the volume is chock full of studies relating to the effect of food on diabetes. It's well worth a read.Dr. Cousins provides convincing arguments to eliminate milk, milk products white bread and caffeine from your diet. He is also convinced that smoking is also a factor, affecting both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.Lot's of good info.",
