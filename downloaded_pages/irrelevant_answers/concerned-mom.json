            "answer": "Unfortunately, the early teen years are a stage of life where diabetes can pop up even if not on Risperdal. I was diagnosed when almost 13, and this is a common age to see the beginnings of diabetes. So do get him tested. If he has gained a lot of weight (above what is considered normal), a switch to another medication may help, and losing the excess weight may help bring the glucose levels down. In any event, once you have results on the tests, I hope his doctor will have a good plan of action. What a good mom to notice these changes and to be concerned enough to check them out. I hope all will be OK.",

            "answer": "The weight gain is most probably due to risperidone and even if your son is diagnosed with diabetes it won't go away.\u00a0\u00a0 Losing wieght while insulin dependent is hard, but it can be done. You could try letting him drink sugar-free drinks and\u00a0\u00a0eating low carbohydrate foods like raw veggies and fruits, instead of battling over foods.\u00a0\u00a0Take him to his doctor and stay on the Risperidal-risperidone.\u00a0\u00a0Have him tested for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The sugar craving is also from risperidone-other people on antipschotics report the same things.\u00a0\u00a0You might try joining a support group, such as NAMI.org, for the families of mentally ill.",

    "question": "My 13 year old son is bi-polar. He is taking a drug called Risperdal, which can directly affect glucose levels, cholesterol and triglycerides. He has always tolerated this drug very well...been on it for 3 years. We routinely have bloodwork done. In the past 4 months he has gained nearly 20 lbs, drinks and urinates constantly and craves carbs and\u00a0\u00a0sweets. He was always a normal weight before. The most recent fasting glucose registered extremely high and now the psychiatrist is recommending a glucose tolerance test. I am having a very difficult time controlling his fluid and carb intake, however the Risperdal is necessary to control psychotic episodes. We have tried over the years taking him off this drug and putting him on another with very negative results. There is a history of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes on both sides of the family. Have you ever heard of a young teen developing diabetes as a result of other medications?",
