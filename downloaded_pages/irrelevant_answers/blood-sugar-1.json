            "answer": "Your numbers are definitely in the pre'diabetes range, I{m not sure why your doctor hasn{t diagnosed you as such. The criteria for pre'diabetes is over 100 fasting or an A1C of 5.7. Diabetes is fasting of 126 or A1C of 6.5. Non'diabetics generally don{t go over 120 whatever they eat. You should get an A1C done. Being diagnosed pre'diabetic is a good opportunity to make some changes to stop or slow the progression to diabetes including losing weight if needed, reducing carbs and getting regular exercise.",

            "answer": "I don't know anything about anima or platelets. This is a separate issue. Your doctor is wrong because small people CAN have Type 2. They can even more likely have Lada/1.5 which is a slow onset type 1. Get yourself tested for diabetes (A1C) as well as dealing with your other issues.",

            "answer": "As I mentioned above, normal A1C is under 5.7. Anything between 5.7 and 6.4 is considered pre-diabetes, and 6.5 and over is considered diabetes.Those of us who are already diagnosed diabetic (not sure if this is what you are asking) have varied goals. Many doctors are content with an A1C under 7.0. Most of us prefer to be around 6.0 to 6.5. Some people aim to be even lower, having \" normal\"\u00a0\u00a0range A1Cs. This is possible, but hard work.",
