            "answer": "You CAN get Better !! Best luck to you ! You didn\u2019t say how old you are? What your doctor said? Are you on medication? Hope you are. To cut out on salt not good enough, with this low IF you should not use salt at all.You must calculate the sodium in all meal you eat. In one meal can not have more sodium then 400 mg...Did you realized sodium is there in almost everything naturally.\" Salt is not the only source of sodium you should be concerned about. The NIH, American Medical Association (AMA) and American Dietetic Association (ADA) now strongly urge daily consumption of dietary sodum at between 1,300 and 1,800 milligrams. That means all forms of sodium. Unfortunately, there are a great number of hidden sources of sodium in packaged, canned, frozen and prepared foods as well as in dairy products. And now we have to look out for fresh poultry that is brined, fresh pork that is brined and turkeys with additives, and salt brining as part of their everyday processing. (NOTE: Your vitamins and other supplements may also have sodium. A Centrum Senior or comparable vitamin contains nearly 61 mg of sodium. In our low sodium lifestyle, that can be more than 10% of a desirable daily intake.) Various supplements like chondroitin/glucosomine can have as much as 2,000 mg of sodium. Following are the most prevalent sources of sodium. \"http://www.megaheart.com/sodium_all_about.htmlhttp://diet.virginia.com/caloriecounter/caloriecounter.htmhttp://www.annecollins.com/sodium-diet.htm",

I have had this shortness of breath for two weeks. I had an Angiogram and the doctors said \"my Injection Fraction is 5 to 10% and I have complete Heart Block and my heart is not pumping and I have a lot of fluid in my body\" I was given Lasix shots for a week and I am still short of breath and the fluid seems to keep coming faster than ever before.I know can foods have a lot of salt I do not use can foods and I know salt is in most processing so I try to get foods with no salt in them on the label or low salt on the label. My doctors just look at me funny but not telling me any thing and I want to know. I feel me and my wife should know what is really going on with me.",
