I would go to your doctor and let them know whats going on. They can help you get your periods on track which in the end will help you get your lil babe!",

    "question": "Hi,I am a 21 year old female in good health. However, I have always had an unpredictable cycle. Sometimes I would have my period (which is usually just brown spotting) for a couple weeks, and then it would stop - and not come back for a month or two. I am currently trying to conceive, but am worried that I may not be ovulating or fertile. I was on Cyclessa (birth control) for a year and stopped taking it in September 2009. I bled for a month straight and didn't have another period again until the end of January. I thought I might have been pregnant, because I only bled for four days. It seemed like a \"light period\" very pink and light - not normal for me. I took a pregnancy test and it came back negative. After that, I had a period in March, April, and May, but they seemed like they were 40 days apart. I don't know how I am supposed to keep track of my cycle since I seem to spot for four days, bleed for maybe two days, and then spot for a week, until it dissipates. Help!",
