            "answer": "Hi,I have some questions:You have been a migraineur for a long time.Were your headaches associated with any visual symptoms before? For how long have you been experiencing the headaches?Given that you have been properly assessed, this may sound like\u00a0\u00a0migraine aura. However, there are several factors to consider here: Your age, a positive\u00a0\u00a0family history of stroke, heart problems,diabetes, and smoking history may suggest further evaluation.When was the last time you have been thoroughly evaluated? Coagulation factors, blood sugar and vision problems need to be determined to rule out any other underlying conditions.This may sound like a migraine aura.You may discuss with your physicians hypnic headaches. It is best to have a thorough consult done even just for a baseline work up especially if you have not had thorough assessment for a long time.",

            "answer": "Hi,\"Flourescent Microbes\"\u00a0\u00a0yes I had these when I closed my eyes at night and I had other visual disturbances that made me see two sets of vertical blinds and weird patterns on blank walls, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Mine was from the Topamax that I was on for 10 months.\u00a0\u00a0As I increased the dosage, the problems worsened.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a 50 yr. old female also with a LONG migraine history and I have fibromyalgia.\u00a0\u00a0I had to go off the Topamax (the weight loss was great, but the side effects turned me into a depressed zombie).\u00a0\u00a0Now I'm on Lyrica, it's not yet approved for migraines but the testing is very promising, and I have had very few headaches in the last 2 months since I switched and those have been mild.\u00a0\u00a0I hope and think that probably your symptoms are related to the Topamax also.\u00a0\u00a0The prescription description says that visual disturbances are common.Blessings,Maxfli",

            "answer": "This is my 2nd time on it and I am determined not to gain any weight.\u00a0\u00a0Last time I gained 12 pounds, not too bad, but does make you hungry.\u00a0\u00a0I've been back on it a month and no weight gain because I eat dinner around 7 pm now instead of 5:30, so I don't have that urge for snacks later, I just go to bed by 10:30, usually. (except tonight, I'm up looking at this site for why I have constant eyelid twitches!).I am so much more \"normal\" feeling on the Lyrica.\u00a0\u00a0The Topamax was a disaster.\u00a0\u00a0At first, it did help the migraines but then when I would get them they would be bad, and I started getting them more and more frequently until they were 3 or 4 a week.\u00a0\u00a0I had to go off of it for my sanity.\u00a0\u00a0My sinuses and eyes dried up and it made me depressed. It took me about 3 weeks to wean off the Topamax because you have to taper off slowly.Lyrica actually has an anti-depressant quality to it, so I don't feel depressed at all now.I only take 75 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night so I'm on a low-to-moderate dosage, and after about a week of taking it, it will kick in pretty quick to get rid of the fibro pain and stiffness.\u00a0\u00a0The nice effect of only occassional mild migraines is so wonderful after what I went through!Let me know if you try it, and be sure to give it a week before you notice any difference.\u00a0\u00a0You have to ramp up dosage gradually, just like with the T-max.Maxfli",

    "question": "I have a long history of migraine. I'm a 55 yo f. I also take a number of medications, including Topamax for migraine, blood pressure meds, Celebrex, asthma medication and diabetes medication. However I have had recurring visual disturbances that only happen at night. I get up in the middle of the night - to go to the bathroom - and the bathroom is covered in geometric patterns, like a checkered pattern or little lacework pattern. It's everywhere, the walls, tub, sink, floor. I feel like I'm tripping on something!\u00a0\u00a0This only seems evident when I turn the light on, I don't see this in the dark. However, at times when I go back to sleep I see all kinds of squiggly patterns flash in front of eyes - like little flourescent microbes darting back and forth...and then I fall asleep.My neuro has a theory that it's a migraine aura. I sometimes do wake up with a migraine, but with the Topamax I usually don't and I'm still having the visual disturbances.\u00a0\u00a0Should I get a second opinion on this or forget about it?",
