            "answer": "I am not a doctor, but do know that as you have inflammation of the prostate this will explain why you are not able to empty completely and are experience pressure as if you wish to pee.My husband has been prescribed with a hormonal tablet to reduce the size of his prostate.\u00a0\u00a0He too had urinary problems.\u00a0\u00a0He still has urgent needs to pee, but he also has diabetes and that is another cause for frequent urination.The prostate can only be felt by the doctor through the rectum.\u00a0\u00a0Blood tests would also show high PSI levels in someone with prostate problems.Urine analysis would detect waterwork problems, eg bacterial.Ultrasound would pick up any abnomalities in the bladder.As the doctors have diagnosed inflammation of the prostate, you will probably be given further examination to find out the cause of the inflammation and the way to treat it.Another reason for frequent urination can be diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Have they screened you for this as well to rule this out?",

            "answer": "Thanks. Yes, have been tested for Diabetes.There are no further tests prescribed to find the cause of inflammation.I am also lost that no one is able to say clearly whether it is a bladder problem or prostate problem.It seems like if it is not a bladder problem then it has to be a prostate issue - that's been the approach. Take Antibiotics - \"Cipro\" for a month and see. No other treatment. Wait and see.",

            "answer": "I trust your blood test for diabetes came back negative.\u00a0\u00a0So that is now ruled out.If you are no better after taking the antibiotics, I would suggest going back to the doctor for referral to a urologist.\u00a0\u00a0A urologist specialises in anything connected with waterwork system (in our body) as well as the prostate.He would be able to do thorough checks to find the cause of your discomfort.Regarding the constant irritation or sensation of urination in your penis that could be that your urine is too acidic and is aggravating the tube.\u00a0\u00a0(or you may have some obstruction - urologist is the person to find that out).Try drinking a teaspoonful of Bicaronate of Soda in a tumbler full of water to make the urine more alkaline and see if that eases your symptoms.Bicarbonate of Soda is a white natural chemical compound.\u00a0\u00a0Sodium Bicarbonate is made from the elements carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O) and sodium (Na).Basically it is a powder that has many great uses, from baking, cleaning, getting rid of odours and for home remedies.You can get it from general stores and supermarkets.\u00a0\u00a0In the supermarket you will find it in the baking section.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Oetker Bicarbonate of Soda.\u00a0\u00a0You may find some unbranded packets.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Oetker Bicarb is not that expensive.\u00a0\u00a0Do not get baking powder or raising powder - these are a mix of bicarb with Cream of Tarta (a powder to stablize egg whites).\u00a0\u00a0Because there are so many uses for it and you have access to a computer, I thought it better you look at the web links rather than me copy and paste such a lot of information.I have copied and pasted the links below regarding Bicarbhttp://www.buzzle.com/articles/bicarbonate-of-soda.htmlhttp://www.ehow.com/how_5616960_drink-bicarbonate-soda-health.htmlBicarbonate of soda, better known as baking soda or sodium bicarbonate, has numerous uses--it's a cleaning agent, antacid, fire extinguisher and more. There also are interesting health benefits when you drink baking soda, which is alkaline, in water. Viruses and diseases such as colds, flu, cancer and even heart disease thrive in an acidic body, but cannot survive when your body is alkaline. The 2009 Journal of the American Society of Nephrology revealed a study of 134 patients with advanced kidney disease. Taking baking soda daily dramatically slowed down the progression of kidney disease, resulting in no need for dialysis.Hope you are sorted soon, best wishes.",

    "question": "Hi Doc,I am a 40-yr male having Frequent urination - every half hour. The more frustrating issue is the sensation 24x7 in the penis. The penis seems to have some water in it and that has the sensation all the time. The urine urgency sensation that i can not hold anymore also comes in the penis. Prior to this, throughout my life, i always had urination sensation\u00a0\u00a0in my bladder where my bladder used to be full and i can not hold anymore.After 12-days of having this, I have taken antibiotics for another 17 days now. The antibiotics has not cleared the symptoms yet or has given any significant relief. The doctors are not able to say whether it is a Bladder or Prostate issue clearly. What can be done to first find out whether it is a bladder issue or prostate issue. How to rule out both so that it can be due neurological issue etc.. After the rectal exam, two doctors felt it is prostatitis inflammation.",
