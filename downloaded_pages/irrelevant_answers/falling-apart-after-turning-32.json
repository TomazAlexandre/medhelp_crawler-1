    "question": "I'm a 32 year old female. I recently over the past 3 to 4 months have had dizzy spells where I will just almost fall over to the left side. I've also been having spells were my heart is racing. I went last week to the eye doctor because I'm seeing what looks like a spot light in my right eye with spider webs over my eye. I've had a chest cough that feels like something in my lungs for about 1 month that just will not go away. Yesterday my legs started to swell and today they are going to sleep. I really feel like I'm falling apart. Is this just something that will pass or should I have it checked out?",
