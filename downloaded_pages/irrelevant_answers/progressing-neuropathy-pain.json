            "answer": "The pain I have in my hands is a little different. My hands and fingers are very sensitive to touch. If I scrape or rub my hands on something, it almost feels like I cut myself, and the pain lasts for several minutes before slowly dissipating. Sometimes it is so sharp it causes me to tense up. If my hands are feeling very sensitive that day, simply scratching an itch cause me to have pain.We went to the beach this week, and the sensation of walking on the hot sand caused excruciating pain that I have never had before. I believe the hot sand may have triggered the symptoms I am now having in my feet. I have not walked in the sand for several days now and my symptoms are still persistent. I have a burning pain on the tops of my feet and between my toes that is extremely uncomfortable, especially at night. I have not been able to sleep in several days. The pain mostly stays in my feet, but every once in a while I will get a shot up the leg into my lower back and hip area.\u00a0\u00a0Every step feels like I am stepping on something sharp. I am also experiencing a strong itching sensation, but when I scratch the itch, I feel a much deeper burn that persists for several minutes. No sunburn or athletes foot, that was my first thought. Pain is worse on the left side, and is present down the entire left leg.",

    "question": "I am posting my ? in 2 parts:I have been having mild neuropathy pain for years now, mostly in my hands. I thought I may just have a mild case of CT syndrome, as my symptoms were just the occasional numbness and tingling in the hands and fingers. The only history I have of any injury is w/ my epidural for my 2nd child 6 years ago. There was a problem with the insertion of the needle. DR described the incident as a \"wet stick,\" and repositioned the needle. Before he moved it, I was have burning, radiating pain from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet. After he moved it, I had trouble breathing, and they had to put something in my IV to reverse my plummeting BP. I had to stay a few extra days in the hospital so that they could administer a blood patch, since I was having spinal headaches. The patch helped with the headaches, but caused me to have a lot of nerve pain in my extremities for several weeks afterwards, which finally subsided.Over the last several months the pain has spread to my face and legs, and the pain is more sharp instead of the tingling I had before. I am a runner. I don't typically have symptoms with just a light training pace, but my race pace (7.5-8.5 min mile) will actually cause me to have radiating pain into my face and my arms. After full exertion, I can't touch my arms because it feels like I am holding a lit match where touched. This often subsides and goes back to normal after an hour or so. Sometimes during a run it will feel like cold water is running down the back of my legs. Not painful, just uncomfortable, but again, subsides shortly after I finish my run.",
