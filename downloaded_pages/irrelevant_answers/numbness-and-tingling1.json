            "answer": "Good point about the calcium.\u00a0\u00a0My calcium was checked before I left the hospital and I took Calciferol (sp?) and lots of Tums, per docs orders for 14 days post surgery.\u00a0\u00a0The tingling just started within the last few weeks which coincidentally was around the time of the Synthroid dose increase.\u00a0\u00a0I did notice a few days ago some tingling around my mouth but it only lasted a few seconds so I didn't think much about it but that is a clear sign of calcium issue, if in fact there is a calcium issue.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again for the input.",

    "question": "In late August I underwent a total thyroidectomy.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on 150mcg Synthroid.\u00a0\u00a0Earlier this month I had my first blood workup since the thyroidectomy and my TSH was 5.564 and Free T4 of 1.15.\u00a0\u00a0My endo raised my Synthroid to 160mcg and I have since started experiencing slight tingling in my hands.\u00a0\u00a0I have read that with hypothyroidism a symptom can be tingling and numbness but would I be exhibiting these symptoms on higher Synthroid dose.\u00a0\u00a0I am also having some confusion and forgetfulness that seems to have occured since the thyroidectomy.\u00a0\u00a0The tingling makes me think of other issues like circulation issue that could lead to a stroke and diabetes but I am not having any other clinical symptoms that would clearly define that something else is going on.Any input would be greatly appreciated.Thanks.",
