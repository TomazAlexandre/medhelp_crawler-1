            "answer": "Hello,79 is a normal blood sugar and nothing to worry about. You can't go into a diabetic coma with blood sugar at 79.Normal blood sugar range is about 70-120 for non-diabetic persons.If you have had high blood sugars and your blood sugars go down to 79 you may feel a bit shakey or symptoms of low blood sugar, but this is only because you are not used to having normal blood sugar levels.Low blood sugar is typically considered as blood sugars below 65 - 70.\u00a0\u00a0If blood sugar is low it is easy to bring it up by taking a little juice, or sugar.\u00a0\u00a05 - 10 g of sugar may be enough to bring it back up to normal range.hope this helps.",

            "answer": "When you say that your sugar level is 79, do you mean that it is 7.9 mmol/l or 79 mg/dlWith sugar levels of 7.9 mmol/l you would not go into a comma.With sugar levels of 79 mg/dl this is extremely low and you would experience hypoglycaemic symptoms like slurred speech, headache, lack of concentration, extreme hunger and nausea and you would need immediate help by ingesting glucose or if you did go into a coma, then be hospitalised and put on a drip to administer glucose into your body.A HbA1c or A1c reading of 7 would not put you in the risk of getting into a coma.\u00a0\u00a0This is the equivalent of 154 mg/dl and 8.6 mmol/lThe web link below does have a conversion chart that you can look at with regard to sugar level readings.http://diabetes.about.com/od/doctorsandspecialists/a/A1c-To-Eag-Conversion-Chart.htmHope this helps.",

            "answer": "JemmaI dont know where you get your info (I expect from a book).\u00a0\u00a079 is NOT \"extremely low\" it is in fact a in the range of Normal BG (65 to 120).\u00a0\u00a0BG over 136 causes damage to nerves and blood vessels and will lead to complications.BG at 79 will cause ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.BG u der 70 should be avoided due to the possibility of going lower into danger low BG.Having hypo symptoms does not mean you are hypo, just meant there not used to normal BG from being high for so long.\u00a0\u00a0keeping BG so high\u00a0\u00a0as to not have hypo symptoms will lead to continued high BG and complications.\u00a0\u00a0high BG WILL lead to amputating toes then feet then going Blind.79 is NOT high, get used to 79 and you leave the hypo symptoms behind.Low is not until you under 60 and its not dangerous until you get under 50 if even then Ive been as low as 35\u00a0\u00a0its not good to be that low and running that low can cause damage and you can go into a coma.\u00a0\u00a0NO one goes into a come at 70 or 60.",

            "answer": "diabetes86 if you read my message properly you will have seen where I got my information from with regard to the conversation of mg/dl to mmol/lBecause in the US the diabetic measurements are in mg/dl, I do need to have those figures converted to mmol/l to understand the readings better.\u00a0\u00a0mmol/l are the measurement that is used in the UK that I am more familiar with.I also have a knowledge of diabetes and have been to diabetic classes because I too have Type 2 diabetes that is controlled by Metformin 500 SR.\u00a0\u00a0My husband has Type 2 diabetes and has to control his by insulin and Metformin 100mg, my mother has Type 2 diabetes and has to take insulin and Metformin.My mother has on many occasions suffered from hypos and from hypers so I am familiar with those and the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0She too has peripheral nerve damage.\u00a0\u00a0 The way my mother was diagnosed as having diabetes is when alarm bells rang for me when her optician asked her \"Are you a diabetic?\"\u00a0\u00a0She does have diabetic retinopathy.I am aware of the dangers of uncontrolled high sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0My husband's grandmother at the age of 90 suddenly collapsed and was found to have had diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Whilst visiting her in hospital I did see her black foot that was protruding from under the sheets and knew exactly what that was.\u00a0\u00a0Shortly afterwards she had to have her leg amputated.\u00a0\u00a0She lived until she was 92.Two younger persons that I grew up with also through uncontrolled diabetes lost their eyesight and had to have\u00a0\u00a0amputations because of gangrene and long afterwards did die.I too recognise when my body goes into a hypo and have to have something to eat quickly.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed many years ago as having peripheral nerve damage and the neurologist said \"Control your diabetes\".\u00a0\u00a0At that time I was not even diagnosed as having pre-diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I have had pre-diabetes for 6 years before the doctor confirmed that I am now a Type 2 diabetic.I worked with a young person who had diabetes and in fact her co-workers had noticed that something was not right with her. She refused to have her digestive biscuit and a cup of tea and in fact collapsed and went into a coma.\u00a0\u00a0She did survive.I am aware that Hypoglycaemia is a medical condition that occurs when blood sugar levels become less than 70 mg/dL. When the blood sugar levels continue to fall, and become less than 55 mg/dL,A reading of 70 mg/dl is the same as 3.9 mmol/l.\u00a0\u00a0This is low for a diabetic and would cause symptoms of hypoglycaemia.\u00a0\u00a0My mother would experience hypoglycaemic symptoms when her sugar levels dropped to 4.5 mmol/l.\u00a0\u00a0I have experienced hypoglycaemic symptoms myself but do not know how low my sugar levels dropped to as I do not have a glucose monitor.\u00a0\u00a0I do know that I felt extremely ill to the point of vomiting and headache and shaking and had to have something to eat quickly.Although 70 mg/dl won't put someone into a coma, if nothing is done to prevent the sugar levels from dropping further, then there is the risk of collapse.",
