            "answer": "when squamous cells are identified it basically means that skin cells were found in the \"clean catch\" to be cultured. Because of this, they would not be able to get an accurate culture. Normally if you have UTI symptoms you are started on some antibiotic while they run the culture. The purpose of the culture is to make sure they're treating you with the right antibiotics. I would follow up if you are still not well.",
