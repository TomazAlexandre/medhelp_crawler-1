            "answer": "Hi Trin,I believe metformin acts as an insulin sensitizer, rather than a drug that promotes insulin production.\u00a0\u00a0It helps our body\u2019s cells use insulin more efficiently; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely to promote hyperglycemia when taken without other antidiabetes meds. I have occasional periods of hyperglycemia but I also use Glipizide and Avandia.If you decide to incorporate it, you might get GI upset/diarrhea for a week or two initially; we tend to acclimate to it quickly, but the first couple of weeks are interesting :o).For what it\u2019s worth, I used 2g/day throughout my first Tx, but relapsed anyway; so don\u2019t expect it to be a panacea.--Bill",

It's good to know research continues to explore the possibilties.I wonder if some where down the line, we may use supps or an off label med to suppress viral load prior to tx, then zap it with a potent pharmaceutical, but for a shorter length of time, then resume supps and or/off labels for further fibrosis reversal. From what I read also, the lean towards individualized tx is encouraging. Perhaps it'll come down to finding the right \"blend\" for each patient.",

Our FDA went through the same review on Avandia recently, and reluctantly left it on the shelf; however, it is used only when patients are found refractory to other, similar drugs, I believe.FlGuy, although I was down to 185 pounds at one point during treatment, I\u2019m currently the lankiest 6\u2019 0\u201d 250 pounder you\u2019ve ever seen :o). I\u2019ve always led an active lifestyle, so I don\u2019t fit the sedentary profile of typical DM II patients. I imagine perhaps HCV hastened this along; although both my mother and father developed diabetes later in life as well.--Bill",

    "question": "It seems this forum is becoming an alternative / supplement forum so I hope it is ok to post this. Here is an interesting article about a prescription drug, the diabetic drug Metaformin. An old drug that has been around a long time. And is very inexpensive. They are finding it has many uses including anti-cancer properties. I think it is great when an existing\u00a0\u00a0drug is found to work for other diseases. Especially drugs that patents have run out and are now inexpensive. Also Metaformin has shown promise against many cancers.\u00a0\u00a0You will hear more about off label Metaformin use in the near future.Research led by the University of Leeds has found drugs such as anti-diabetic drug Metformin and AICAR, used to combat obesity, can prevent the hepatitis C virus from replicating in the body.Hepatitis C virus affects an estimated three per cent of the world's population and there are four million carriers of the virus in Europe alone. The virus affects the liver and recovery rates are low: only around 40 per cent of hepatitis C sufferers will fully recover, with others developing cirrhosis and in many cases, liver cancer.\"We're very excited about these findings,\" says Professor Mark Harris from the University's Faculty of Biological Sciences. \"These drugs are already on the market, and whilst substantial clinical trials still need to take place before they can be used to treat hepatitis C infection, we think it could be an enormous step forward in the battle against the virus.\"The research was supported by the Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.Drugs such as Metformin and AICAR work by stimulating an enzyme called AMP kinase (AMPK) which regulates energy within our cells - the very enzyme that hepatitis C virus represses to enable it to replicate.AMPK's usual function is to conserve the energy balance in cells, which it does by temporarily shutting down the production of lipids (fats) and membranes when it senses an increase in energy requirements. Professor Harris and his team have now shown that the hepatitis C virus switches off AMPK so that the cell continues production of lipids and membranes, both of which are vital to its survival.\"You'd expect AMPK to be activated when a cell becomes infected by a virus, because it would sense the increase in energy required to enable the virus to replicate. In such cases, AMPK would shut down certain functions of the cell temporarily until the cell's energy is rebalanced,\" says Prof Harris. \"We found that hepatitis C virus, because it needs lipids and membranes, causes the opposite to happen.\"Building on this finding, the research team were able to examine how cells would react when treated with common drugs that stimulate AMPK. They found that in infected cells, the drugs were able to halt virus replication, enabling cells to clear the infection.A patent has been filed on the discovery and the team will shortly embark on a small-scale clinical trial with The University of Nottingham. This will provide a greater evidence base upon which future clinical trials can be based.More information: This research is published in a paper entitled Enhanced hepatitis C virus genome replication and lipid accumulation mediated by inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase in the latest edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).",
