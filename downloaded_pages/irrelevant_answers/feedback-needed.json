            "answer": "Having semi-numb/tingly feeling feet for two weeks can be attributed to diabetes. But this also can be warning signs of other serious health issues briefly mentioned at the end of my post.You can rule out diabetes rather easily; go to your local drug store [CVS, Walgreens, Rite-Aid, Wal-Mart] and purchase an A1c [aye one see] test kit. They usually run around $20.00. You can read about the A1c test here and why it is important in diagnosing diabetes.http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/a1c-test/MY00142The test results are presented in % [percent]. These are what the values mean:Normal - 4.1 to 5%Prediabetes - 5 to 6%Diabetes - above 6.1%If you test normal, call your doctor ASAP to check pressure on a spinal nerve, thyroid issue, abnormal levels of minerals in your body, or the beginning of MS. Good luck",
