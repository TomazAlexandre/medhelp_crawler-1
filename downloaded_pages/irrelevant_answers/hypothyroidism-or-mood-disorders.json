            "answer": "I would suggest that you have your doctor refer you to an endocrinologist. Your Free T4 level is holding nicely, but your free t3 is a little low. Did you know that a lower free t3 has been found to cause depression? Usually a good psychiatrist will test for this since it has become a factor for many patients answers to depression. Your TSH just isn't registering properly with your Free T4. You may need some further pituitary tests.Personally speaking I think that I would demand to see an endocrinologist. I would also ask your psychiatrist to look up and read all the numerous studies pertaining to depression and T3 levels.",

            "answer": "I agree with laura.it appears you may have a problem converting T4 into T3.\u00a0\u00a0While many Dr's seem to dismiss this possibility, some trials have indicated that up to 60% of the people may have this problem.Don't be too alarmed, as simply adding in a T3 medication component can solve this situation.You may want to ask your Dr to change medication to natural Armour which has both T3 and T4 components.\u00a0\u00a0Or add a small dosage of T3 medication such as Cytomel.The trick is that most people will get symptom relief when their Free T4 is about mid range and yours is exactly mid range.\u00a0\u00a0AND their Free T3 in the UPPER 1/3 of the range.\u00a0\u00a0You are testing FT3 at 2.9.\u00a0\u00a0The upper 1/3 of the range starts at 3.57.So as a target you will want to try to get your FT3 to 3.5 or above.Remember that everyone is different and need a different level to feel well.\u00a0\u00a0The mid range and upper 1/3 are a general guideline.Also understand and have your Dr understand that TSH should be disregarded or at least NOT used as a primary tool.\u00a0\u00a0When taking thyroid meds the medication can suppress TSH.\u00a0\u00a0The body ONLY uses the Free T3 molecule and thus this is key to keep track of and it is the only test which correlates to symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0TSH and even Free T4 have almost no correlation with symptoms unless they are dramatically off.DO NOT.\u00a0\u00a0let your Dr treat you until you simply fall somewhere in all of the so called \"normal ranges\".\u00a0\u00a0If you don't get to mid range and upper 1/3 you will likely continue to not feel as well as you could.",

            "answer": "Since thyroid test results will vary somewhat from one lab to another, they develop their own reference ranges for each test.\u00a0\u00a0So it would be best to have the reference range from the lab that ran the test.\u00a0\u00a0That said, I can say that frequently I see reference ranges for Free T4 that are in the area of .60 - 1.50, so your result would be lower than desired in that range.\u00a0\u00a0Just because a thyroid test result falls within the range does not mean that it is adequate for you.\u00a0\u00a0The ranges are far too broad.Also, the Free T4 test is not adequate for a good evaluation of thyroid levels.\u00a0\u00a0You also need to test for Free T3.\u00a0\u00a0Free T3 is the most important because it largely regulates metabolism and many other body functions.\u00a0\u00a0Scientific studies have also shown that Free T3 correlated best with hypo symptoms, while Free T4 and TSH did not correlate.What symptoms are you having that led you to be tested for thyroid hormone level?",

    "question": "I would like your input as I went back to see my psychiatrist regarding my medication in which she changed Doxepin from 100 mg to 50 mg (due to the fact of me telling her that I am very fatigued) and am still on Trazodone 100 mg she also added Haldol 0.5 mg at bedtime as I was telling her about my anxiety problems where I feel alot of sensations going through my body, feeling shaky etc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I also have been medically diagnosed as having 'hypothyroidism along with 'borderline' diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I am currently taking Synthroid 50 mcg for my hypothyroidism but just watching my diet for the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My prim dr tells me the anxiety is NOT caused by hypothyroidism but other people say it maybe a factor.\u00a0\u00a0I will be seeing my prim dr in Oct for a followup on my hypothyroidism.My latest blood test from July is as follows:Hemoglobin A1C 6.5 which Ref Range 4.0-6.0 Est.
