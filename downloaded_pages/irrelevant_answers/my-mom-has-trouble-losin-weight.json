            "answer": "Another thing can be that her metabolism is a bit different, that happens.My Dad was like that. He then changed his diet, he doesnt eat any sugar, no potatoes, no bread, no rice or pasta. Just veggies, nuts, lean meat and fatty fish, fruits and low fat and no sugar dairy. He lost 30 kgs in a year O.oby the way, you dont loose weight with workout, you just help form muscles and keep the lower weight when you lost some via diet. It also is good for the heart and against insulin resistance.Good luck!",

    "question": "My mom is 52, 5\"3 and around 180 pounds. She doesn't exercise overly vigorously but does go on 2 hour walks about twice a week, and is constantly running around at her full time job. She eats VERY, very well, and almost never eats junk food. She seems to continue gaining weight. I understand that more regular exercise is crucial but she's so tired from working everyday- should she really be struggling with her weight and GAINING weight over the years if she eats incredibly healthy home cooked meals?",
