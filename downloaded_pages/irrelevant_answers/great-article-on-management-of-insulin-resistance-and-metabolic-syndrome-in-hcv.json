            "answer": "is a known complication of all types of liver disease, but research indicates that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection plays a more direct role in abnormal glucose metabolism - an association that appears to differ based on HCV genotype. Studies have shown that HCV infection is associated with a higher rate of diabetes, and that blood glucose abnormalities, in turn, are linked to more severe fibrosis. Sustained responders to interferon-based therapy typically experience improved insulin sensitivity - though patients with insulin resistance are less likely to respond to anti-HCV treatment.Ron",

He even agrees that if he can get his weight under control,\u00a0\u00a0that alone will take care of some of his other problems and then if he decided to tx again,,,better success.",

            "answer": "I agree with most of what you say. I do take exception to your characterization of a person's chances of achieving SVR who has diabetes brought on by HCV as \"nill\". I do so in part because I am diabetic as a result of HCV and yet I am SVR. I am also a transplant recipient who was treated for acute rejection 2 or 3 times with bolus injections of Solu-Medrol and those factors don't bode well at all for one's chances at SVR. I think we should be very careful not to destroy someone's hope because in the final analysis without hope we don't have much left. And people can and do beat the odds and though I don't believe in holding out false hope I also don't believe in dashing someone's hope when there is reason for hope. I'm probably too sensitive about this but that's just the way I am. I wasn't offended by what you said - I just don't agree with it.\u00a0\u00a0Mike",

What I didn't know was that insulin resistance increased fibrosis :-(No wonder I have 10 KPA in my last fibroscan...I've given up on candies and marzipan :-( and I do encourage all my heppers friends to drop sweets in all forms...and those with diabetes maybe should evaluate extending tx or exercise prior and during tx and follow and all of us shoudl manage glucose levels imho",
