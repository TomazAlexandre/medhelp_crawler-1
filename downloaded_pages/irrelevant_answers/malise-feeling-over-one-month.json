            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Malaise without a cause (I say this because you have been extensively investigated) is generally due to fibromyalgia type of syndromes or due to depression and anxiety. Low hemoglobin or iron is another reason, but I think that must have been taken care of in CBC. Was your blood sugar tested? Diabetes is another cause of malaise. Another reason can be Vitamin B (complex or B12) deficiency. A simple blood test can identify this.Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "HiThanks for keeping me posted!Yes, severe acidity can disturb sleep especially if it is associated with GERD or hiatal hernia. You should avoid food at least 2 hours before bedtime. Avoid too much of caffeine.Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
