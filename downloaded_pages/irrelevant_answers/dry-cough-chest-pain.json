            "answer": "Hi,Has a chest xray been done to rule out any rib fracture, chest infection, or air in the pleural space?There could be several causes of the symptoms you are having including a muscle pull, injury or trauma at the site, chest infection, etc.Do you have any associated symptoms?You should apply some local pain relief medications, take some oral pain relief medications, maintain a proper posture throughout the day, try some warm compresses.You could take some antireflux antinausea medications and see if they help with your symptoms - this could be pain due to reflux or GERD.Consult the doctor if the symptoms persist and discuss whether you need to get any investigations including a chest xray and ECG done.Let us know about how you are doing and if you need any other information.Regards.",
