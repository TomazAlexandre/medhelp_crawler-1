            "answer": "I do understand what you're saying and as you know everyone is different!I'm just passing information along. My mother In law had Cholesterol off the charts and never had a problem. She died at 90 from cancer. I eat just about everything my Chol. Is normal. But at the age of 61 I had brain surgery because I had a brain tumor removed and two weeks later I had 3 clots in my left lung and 2 in the right lung. What the doctor found out was that I have 2 genetic factors for have blood clots. After being treated somewhat they said I should be on an aspirin therapy I said I don't have heart problems and that aspirin can cause bleeding and a stroke. The Dr. said you're going on the aspirin and with that 2 weeks later I had 4 clots 2 in each leg. So a long story short I have a filter in me and I take rat poison to keep my blood flowing. I try not to eat anything that contains vitamin KAnd try to supplement with things that thin the blood.",

I cut out my cat's carbs immediately and my cat's dementia symptoms improved drastically (only some mild behavioural issues remaining), she lost weight, her appetite improved, no more severely itchy face/facial scabs, more energy - my cat is playing like a kitten and my cat is 14 years old! So glad that book came out. I have my cat back. :)",

It's inserted through the groin and into the large vein in the abdomen that returns blood from the lower body to the heart. It's permanently implanted.\u00a0\u00a0You know when they did the MRV and Doppler on me and said I had clots I pictured a little blood clot. But that's not the case the clot went just about the length of my legs that's about 7 years ago. About 6 months ago they said the clot in my left side is about 5\"\u00a0\u00a0long and the right side about 3\". The body in time will absorb the clots. As for the rat poison Coumadin is put into rat bait so when they eat the bait they will bleed to death. I guess if it's good enough for rats it's good enough for humans.",
