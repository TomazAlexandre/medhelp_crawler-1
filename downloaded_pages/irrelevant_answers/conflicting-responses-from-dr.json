            "answer": "DOc hasn't said anything about protein being in my urine, the first numbers I gave were the fasting numbers the dietician wanted to see below 90, the doc didn't specify what he wanted to see for fasting, just said between 100-140... my fasting has slowly been coming down almost every day except when I was sick, from a starting fasting B.S.L. of about 129, to today at which point my fasting level was 91.Yesterday after I ate my breakfast out, I tested around noon, it was 252. When I tested at four in the afternoon, it read 68. I also found out TODAY that my meter has been off by at least 12 points on the high-side, so my friend fixed it for me. :-)",

            "answer": "I meant that the Doc said he'd allow for higher blood sugar levels (between 100 & 140, I believe he said), the dietician said she'd like to see it between 90 & 130 or so, and for the most part, I've been in those ranges (except when I go out to eat, which I've now completely cut myself off from because it seems no matter what I eat, (or how little) if I'm eating restaraunt food, it sends it high).... But other than the few from eating out, they are within \"normal ranges\" it all seems so confusing... :-S",

    "question": "I am 32wks, I have gestational diabetes. My dietician set lower goals for my blood-sugar-levels than my Dr. did... I saw my dietician the other day, and she was VERY happy with my new readings. A couple of days later, I got a call from my Dr.'s office to come in a.s.a.p. because he's Not happy with them... if he had set higher goals than the dietician, why would he be upset with my new readings if the dietician isn't? I'm SOOO confused about this, it just doesn't make any sense....",
