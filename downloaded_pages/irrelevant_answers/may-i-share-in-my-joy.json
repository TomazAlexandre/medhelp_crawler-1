    "question": "This is totally off subject, but such a land-mark in my life that I want to scream it to the mountain-tops, with my best freinds; the members of my cyber family on the MS Forum...Fourteen years ago on my 40th birthday I sat in a doctor's office, when he broke the news to me that I was now a Type 2 Diabetic that would have to be treated aggressively.\u00a0\u00a0I had very high and dangerous blood sugar readings.\u00a0\u00a0I first started on oral medication and a strict diet.\u00a0\u00a0Throughout the years, my diabetes could not be controlled and I was placed on pills AND daily insulin shots.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of insulin. It was a fight to keep my diabetes under control.Two and a half years ago, I lost 125 pounds and started to see my blood sugar readings coming down.\u00a0\u00a0I was able to stop insulin.\u00a0\u00a0A true victory for me.\u00a0\u00a0I remained on diabetes pills twice a day until last week.\u00a0\u00a0My blood sugar was low.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor's cut my medication in half.\u00a0\u00a0Another victory.\u00a0\u00a0Today, the doctor's cut ALL my diabetes medicine.First the first time in 14 years I am now FREE of any and all diabetes medicine.\u00a0\u00a0Does that mean that I am cured?\u00a0\u00a0No, I will always have to be careful and watch my sugar closely.\u00a0\u00a0But no more pills....WHOPEEEE!BUT...I DO FEEL FREE...for the first time in 14 years.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for letting me share this news with you.\u00a0\u00a0Wonder if I can get away with going to Dairy Queen tonight for a milkshake with bits of Oreo cookie in them?\u00a0\u00a0Naw...I better leave that stuff alone.Have a GREAT DAY everyone...I know I will....Heather",
