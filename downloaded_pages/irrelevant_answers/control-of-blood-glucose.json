            "answer": "There are lots of philosophies and different diabetic etiologies. It sounds like your physician is conscientious. Your blood sugars are a tad high, and you might want to ask them to switch to Metformin. You might also ask your physician is he would recommend Lantus, a 24 hour injectable insulin. Diabetes tends to be a progressive disorder, unfortunately, but the rate of progression is variable.",

            "answer": "Ok, you seem to be unclear on many things about your diabetes and I seriously urge you to talk more with your doctor or even better see an endocrinologist. Who told you that you are Type 2? GAD antibodies are indicators of Type 1 or LADA/Type 1.5. Type 2's do not have antibodies. It is not a matter of \"getting your GAD number down\" it doesn't work that way. All that the GAD indicates is that you have an autoimmune disease which is Type 1 or LADA. Treatment for Type 1 diabetes is insulin because your body doesn't produce enough which is further indicated by your c-peptide. Please see an endo and get on the correct treatment.",
