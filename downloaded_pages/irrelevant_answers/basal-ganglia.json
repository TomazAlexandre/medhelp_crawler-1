            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Why was the CT done in the first place? Do let us know what symptoms you were having?Tuberous sclerosis is a rare, genetic disease that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs, and skin. This multi system disease can cause symptoms like seizures, behavioral problems, skin problems, lung and kidney disease and developmental delay.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage, without further details. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you for your comment. Well, I went to the allergy doctor and on an xray I had a thickening of the shenoid cortex, right wing. That came out to be fibrous displasia and the dr is not concerned. So this came up, the basal ganglia and the tuberous sclerosis is on my ct scan report as a possible diagnosis. I have read about it and it is extremely rare. This is so strange.My symptoms are headaches everyday, not bad, I take excedrin. I have noticed when I talk I hesitate or something. I cant describe it. Kind of a stutter. Ive been doing that for a month, only 10 times maybe. I originally went in to the allergy clinic for sinus problems. I have taken care it.I have goiters on my thyroid, 8 years. I found out I am vitamin d deficient last nov. I recently found out my adrenal glands are shot and my iron is low.I had my appendix and gallbladder out in 2004. I had a complete hysterectomy in 2005. I had jaw surgery in 2008, due to years of tmj. I thought.Who knows now.I have 6 children, my oldest is in Iraq and two of my sons are diabetic since 1998, so i have had stress as far as adrenals and hysterectomy. I have recently started bio-identical hormones. The adrenal problems are just in my opinion alot of stress, just not taking care of my self.So I am on bio-identical hormones, hydrocortizone pills for adrenals, Armour thyroid, prilosec, I am taking extra vitamin c, multi-vitamins, amino acids, gluatamine, iron, I take prescription vitamin d 50,00 iu once a week,( plus 2,000 daily because after 3 months still low).I just cant believe this because it is so rare. I go in Feb 26 for my first appointment with the neurologist. I know they will want to do an mri.Well, thanks so much. I wanted you to see the big picture of my health.I am a nursing student and I was going to start again next week but with this I have to see it through. Thanks again",

            "answer": "HiThanks for keeping me posted!As far as I know, there are no shifting masses found in the brain except maybe a worm that forms a cyst. Basal ganglion is a normal part embedded in the white matter of the brain. \u2018No intracranial mass-effect\u2019 is meant for any abnormal swellings like an aneurysm, a tumor, a cyst etc. You have a complex array of symptoms. I feel with history of thyroid, Vit D deficiency, high cholesterol, adrenal involvement and a family history of diabetes an autoimmune component should be looked into. Since you have Vitamin D deficiency maybe the parathyroids too should be looked at.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thanks for your advice. I am seeing a neurologist in one week. Im sure we will do an mri and go from there. I have a great endocrinologist and he has run almost every test under the sun. I will ask him about parathyroids. What doctor is most helpful for autoimmune? Ive never looked into it but I guess there is specialist.Here is a possible cause that I feel is a great reason for my wide array of symptoms.I had a complete hysterectomy my health went down hill. Everything works together so the loss of producing my own hormones made a tremendous difference. It put stress on my body and stress on the adrenals. I think my adrenals were all-ready going down hill before then. So your adrenal feeds your thyroid, I dont have severe thyroid problems, just goiters. The endo says i'm neither really high or low. The vitamin d is because of feeling so horrible from lack of hormones and adrenal I never got out. I only get out when I have to. I only move when I have to! So the effect of vitamin d is lack of sunlight.\u00a0\u00a0Ive been inside for 3 years. I mean I would not do any outdoor activity, just to get in and out of my car. My cholesterol was even 197 in my 20's. I am 42 and it is now 220. It is high because I slowly gained 30 pounds after my hysterectomy, thus again because of everything working together. The diabetes just came up with my sons, type 1, it does not run in my family. I had special testing done through their doctor that shows it didnt come from me and that I'd never get it most likey. Thyroid and adrenal problems do not run in my family. The only true genetic thing that does run in my family is high cholesterol. My family is blown away because none of these problems run in our family.So, what do you think of my reasoning?",
