            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!What you have is probably blepharitis or inflammation of eye lids. Wash your eyes by splashing clean water. Then clean debris with soft cotton balls. Apply a warm wet compress to the lids. Apply antibiotic cream. Since it is persisting for so long it can be seborrheic blepharitis or dysfunction of mebomian glands of the eyelid. Tear supplements, bland ointments at night also help. Treating scalp dandruff also brings relief. Consult your eye specialist and discuss. Proper eye care and person hygiene is important. Rule out diabetes as it can cause an infection to persist. Take care!",
