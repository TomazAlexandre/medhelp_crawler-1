            "answer": "GD is caused by a hormone made by the placenta. If you control your diet and watch carb & sugar intake per meal you should be able to control it. Taking your blood sugars 2hrs after each meal should give you a good idea on how your body is handling your insulin levels. I too have GD and so far so good on being controlled just with my diet. It is extremely important to keep yourself in check, granted it is hard!!! I keep a daily log, Am fasting and then 2hrs after each meal. Then take it to the doctor at each visit so they can review the results. You don't want the baby to get too large, for it can cause issues with he delivery and the blood sugars for baby after he/she is born. Hope that bit of info helps you!!!",

If you do eat more carbs, then you will have to go for a walk right after or before to lower it.I also get ultrasounds too to make sure my baby is not getting too big. If she gets too big then they will have to induce me and my doctor and I are both trying to avoid that.I did cheat at my baby shower and had cake and key lime pie!",
