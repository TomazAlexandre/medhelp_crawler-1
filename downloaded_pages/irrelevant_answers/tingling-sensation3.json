            "answer": "Thank you for taking the time to respond. I've done MRI, EEG, carotid...., quite a number of intensive tests. Everything seems to be fine, but God knows I'm not fine. I'll be going for sleep study on 7 Mar. I tried various alternative treatments- acupuncture, reflexology, ayurvedic, etc, no positive results so far. Is there a way to stop the tingling sensations while waiting for the real cause of the problem?",

    "question": "i have tingling/crawling sensation on my arms and legs. There are 'attacks' when my left hand starts shaking. I've done MRI, and host of other tests. Doctors said i'm fine. There are times when I don't get it for three days in a row. But lately, I've been getting the attacks daily. The attacks lasts fro about 30 seconds. I don't see any pattern yet - like what makes the tingling sensation disappears and what makes it comes back. Anyone experience it before?",
