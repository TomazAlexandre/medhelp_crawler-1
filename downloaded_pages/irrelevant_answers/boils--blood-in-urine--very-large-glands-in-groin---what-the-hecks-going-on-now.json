I also get them under my breast, inner thigh, and also my waist. Could this mean I have contracted HIV?? I had an HIV test done in 2008 when I was pregnant with my son. It came back negative. These abscess or boils have been coming and going for years now. WHAT COULD THIS BE??? I had unprotected sex back in 2007. But I took the HIV test in 2008 well over three months. I had unprotected sex with a guy in November of 2009, but I had them before I had sex with him. PLEASE HELP :-(",

    "question": "Not sure whats going on bu I had a crop of boils approx two weeks ago in groin area and back of thighs. My Gp gave me antibiotics which I finished a week ago. The bolis had subsided dramatically and wernt red or causing trouble. Anyway over the last few days I have come out in another crop in a differnt area , my glands are very swollen , red and painful, Ive got quite bad stabbing pain in my left lower back radiating to the abdomen on the left side and blood in my urine. My Gps given me another course of antibiotics differnt ones called co-amoxiclav and sent my urine sample off for analysis. Are the boils and blood in urine related or seperate issues. If so what? Be grateful of any ideas. I did ask my Gp and as usual didnt really get an answer other than oh I think you need antibiotics.Thanks Chris",
