            "answer": "Talk to your doctor. He will do a fasting blood sugar or an A1C which measures the average blood sugars over a period of a couple months. The most common symptoms of diabetes are excessive thirst and urination, sometimes increased hunger,\u00a0\u00a0fatigue and sometimes weight loss. However, many people don't have any symptoms at all until it is quite advanced.
