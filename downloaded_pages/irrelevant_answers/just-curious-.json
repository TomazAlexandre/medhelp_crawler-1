            "answer": "Hey Cindy ..Most DR.(at least here in Canada) will run the ... \"Plasma Glucose test\"\u00a0\u00a0then if there is a higher than normal reading on that they will run the... \"Glucose tolerance test\"\u00a0\u00a0I believe if the reading on that one is higher than 140mg/dl you are considered pre-diabetic and higher than 200mg/dl you are diabetic.The second test is the one GDSgirl mentioned where you drink the sweet stuff and they take blood after a few hrs.Hope that helpsWILL",

            "answer": "Hi Cindy,Your comprehensive metabolic panel often includes a fasting glucose test; you might check there. Typically, we like to see a result of less than 99 mg/dL. Results between 100 and 124 can be suggestive of pre-diabetes, while results above 125 mg/dL can indicate a diabetic condition. All those results are fasting; i.e. nothing but fresh water for 8 hours prior to testing.A better diagnostic test for diabetes is the A1c test; but this won\u2019t normally be ordered unless the health care provider feels it\u2019s indicated.There\u2019s another test called \u2018HOMA-IR\u2019 as well; this is the ratio between blood serum glucose and insulin, and actually defines insulin resistance.The test Denise mentioned is called a \u2018glucose tolerance\u2019 test.Good luck; do what\u2019s necessary to avoid developing diabetes if it looks like an issue; you really don\u2019t want to deal with that if you can avoid it.-Bill",
