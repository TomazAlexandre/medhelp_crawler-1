    "question": "My nurse said my sugar is a bit high probably because me and DH love rice.\u00a0\u00a0I am feeling guilty and sad at the same time for our baby.\u00a0\u00a0It means I am not eating healthy enough? I will have another test on saturday to confirm if I needed medication to lower my sugar level everyday... I am not looking forward to this since it is a 12hour fasting and they have to draw blood on me more than once in a day and they have to keep me in the lab for two hours.Next is the Iron level.. It went down so I was given supplements... it used to be 114 when I started pregnancy and now it went to down to 110.....Does this mean my baby is not receiving enough iron (nutrients)? from me? I'd rather get less iron as long as he gets enough for himself.\u00a0\u00a0I am not getting much sleep these days though...Ladies, please tell me he's getting enough... I am so sad today because of these results.",
