My husbadn, ALSO, suffered from this EXTREMELY painful and debilitating disease. He suffered from it do to Diabetes.What has brought this on you?I DON'T know whether or not an epidural would work or not. I know when my Husband dies in 1994 that it wasn't EVER offered as a possibility for him.He used medications and the TENS Unit.\u00a0\u00a0Have you EVER tried the TENS Unit?I hope that you will give a little more information on YOUR condition such as the UNDERLYING problem that has caused this disorder.I wish you the VERY best and HOPE that you will keep us updated......Sherry",

            "answer": "Becky,Thank you so much for the kind words!I'm so VERY sorry that happened to you as it is such a TERRIBLE disease and is so VERY painful. I know how much my Husband (Jean - French Spelling for Gene) suffered with it.\u00a0\u00a0He was in agonizing pain much of the last few years ALL because of the Neuropathy.Do you go to a PM (Pain Management) Doctor or to a PCP?\u00a0\u00a0 IF you can get a referral to a PM Dr. that would be the best or Neurologist.I'm VERY glad that you DON'T have Diabetes!!! I was SOOOO afraid that you might have it because that is what had caused Jean's.I hope that you will remain an active member and share your experiences on here with all of the other CP Patients on here.I will be looking for you updates about how you are doing.Best Wishes.......Sherry",
