            "answer": "Hello and Welcome to the Pain Mangement Forum. I am sorry to hear that you have undiagnosed pain. Many of us have been where you are.I agree with Mollyrae that you should have some lab work done. Have they considered the Fibro that she suggested?There is also a similar condition called Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS). This is a fancy way to describe muscle pain. It refers to pain and inflammation in the body's soft tissues.Myofascial pain is a chronic condition that affects the fascia (connective tissue that covers the muscles). Myofascial pain syndrome may involve either a single muscle or a muscle group. In some cases, the area where a person experiences the pain may not be where the myofascial pain generator is located. This is called referred pain.Fibromyalgia and MPS can be difficult to distinguish from one another. Some practitioners beleive they are the same. Both have \"trigger points\" meaning an area of extreme tenderness.\u00a0\u00a0Neither of these conditions can be diagnosed through lab work but rather by the symptoms they present.These may not be what you are suffering from, just a thought. Please let us know how you are doing and keep us posted. Best of luck to you.Take Care,Tuck",
