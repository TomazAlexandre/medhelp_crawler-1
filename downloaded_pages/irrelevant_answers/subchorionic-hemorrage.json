I had bleeding about every weekend I even passed a few clots...it was very scary..however, my twin girls are now 9 months old, healthy and thriving.

I delivered early due to one of the placentas becoming weak (possibly an aftermath of the subchrorionic hematoma and gestational diabetes)...just relax and REST REST REST!!!...God bless!!!",
