            "answer": "I would make an appointment with your Doc first of all, if your weight used to be ok then it could be that you have developed something like an over active thyroid. It could be nothing, our weight does change over the years but I think you ought to have some blood tests just to rule out things like diabetes etc.I don't know whether the discharge is related or not.If there is nothing causing your low weight then your doctor can point you in the right direction, a nutritionalist would be a good idea, you don't want to put weight on too quickly!Hopefully you are just one of those lucky people who can eat what you want LOL.",
