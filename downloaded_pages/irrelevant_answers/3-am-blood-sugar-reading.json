            "answer": "I am amazed that a physician treating a Diabetic would say that testing your blood glucose level daily is not important.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor (and my Diabetes nurse) want me to test 4 or 5 times a day.\u00a0\u00a0I have committed to twice a day but try to do more.\u00a0\u00a0I take 40mg of Glipizide & 2000mg of Glucophage daily.If your blood levels are that high, you either are not taking enough medication or are eating the wrong amount of food.\u00a0\u00a0Believe me, those levels are TOO HIGH for your health.My only suggestion to you is to find another Doctor, immediately if not sooner.Anita",
