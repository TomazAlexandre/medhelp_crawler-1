    "question": "I was classified with type 2 diabetes about a year ago. Since then I get these vaginal rashes that my V.A. doctor keeps classifying as yeast infections. She prescribed me doxycycline and that did not help. She prescribed an antibiotic where there are 2 pills which you take 1 every 72 hours...that helped but within a few days it is back again. This time she prescribed sulfamethoxazole-tmp and that has done nothing. This rash appears as raw circles on the inside of my vaginal lips and it itches like hell and because I have vaginal hair it is sore. Any clue what this could be?",
