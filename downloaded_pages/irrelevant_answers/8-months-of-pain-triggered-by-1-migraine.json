            "answer": "Hi,What investigations did you undergo for headache? Was a CT scan/ MRI of spine done?Also did they test you for anemia?I would also suggest you to get a blood sugar test done to rule out diabetes and get your blood pressure checked to rule out hypertension.Also i would suggest you avoid heavy exercises for some time, If you feel the need to sleep more please do so. Eat on time and maintain proper hydration. Dehydration and hypoglycaemia can cause headache and fatigue. Hope this helps!",

            "answer": "I've gotten the blood sugar test done and it was fine.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes does run in my family though.Blood pressure is generally low, but they said not abnormally low.I had a \"brain MRI\" after a regular MRI was done and nothing came up other than a slightly more large than normal left part of my brain.Exercise is not really bothersome.I'm not sure about anemia, I will ask about that next time.Also am interested in seeing if it is auto-immune related or something along those lines.",

    "question": "I've had 3 \"migraines\" in my life.\u00a0\u00a0They were all diagnosed as such after MRI's came up negative and there seemed to be no other explanation.They were all 3 years apart starting when I was 18.After the first two, I felt groggy for a day, and then was fine.Last April, right before my 24th birthday, I got the 3rd one.Seemingly I have never recovered this time.\u00a0\u00a0Every day since, about 10-15 minutes after I wake up, my stomach starts to become tense.\u00a0\u00a0My whole body fails to relax.\u00a0\u00a0This happens every day, all day.\u00a0\u00a0The one thing that has helped it it hysocyamine(sp?), which is an anti-spasmodic.\u00a0\u00a0Helps relax my stomach a bit and enables me to eat regularly.\u00a0\u00a0However, the pain is still there most of the time.Secondly, I am always fatigued and need an overabundance of sleep.\u00a0\u00a0I can still exercise, but I do overheat a bit more than I used to.Thirdly, about a month afterwards I started getting headaches most days, until it became every day.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the neurologist, who gave me Gabapentin(neurotonin).\u00a0\u00a0This helped a lot initially.The other thing that happens is \"hippus\", where my eye pupils expand and contract rapidly for no reason.I also get some other funny things going on, like lines in my vision, burning sensations in my spine and arteries, pressure under my arms, etc.I sleep very well just need an abnormal amount to function somewhat normally.I've been to Gastro, Neurologist(done tilt table), and a general practice doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I've been told it might be \"stress\" or \"anxiety\" etc.\u00a0\u00a0So even though I was pretty sure I was not stressed or anxious, I let them try different anxiety medications, which didn't help the symptoms and just made me more tired.I am young, healthy, athletic and have no medical problems prior to this.\u00a0\u00a0However, it has become hard to function each day in constant pain and secondarily difficulty in focusing and thinking due to that pain.If anyone can help or has suggestions as to where to go from here, or further questions, please let me know.~Grant",
