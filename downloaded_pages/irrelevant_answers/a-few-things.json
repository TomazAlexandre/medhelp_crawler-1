    "question": "I frequently have to urinate after eating something with sugar in it, specfically rice, but it usually happens a few minutes after I eat that certain food as opposed to a few hours later with people who do have diabetes. Not sure if that's a symptom of diabetes or not. I also get this feeling like the sugar just \"sits\" there and it's really uncomfortably and nothing seems to help.I'm also thinking of performing my own glucose tolerance test and was wondering if there was anything I could drink to replace the glucola bottle. Thanks",
