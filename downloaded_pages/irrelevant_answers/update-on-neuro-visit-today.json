    "question": "The neuro visit went well. She had a nerve test done which felt like shocks in my legs & feet & then she did a test with needles. I have neuroapthy & donated bunches of blood for tests to see how B-12 levels, diabetes, Lupus & other things come out. Another MRI in the morning to compare to one three years ago. I feel tired today & took the B-12 shot yesterday! My neuro told me to try & not worry & that we will figure out what's wrong. I'm trying but still can't help but wonder & worry. Sorry so long a post. Talking to you all has helped me too! Thanks!!!Nancy",
