            "answer": "However - if the freeware doesn't quite do what you want or you want something commerically supported with updates, the PDA applications at http://www.calorieking.com may be better for you.I personally am using CalorieKing's Diet Diary for the Palm PDA to quickly build meals and tally up carbs/calories.\u00a0\u00a0Although I don't use it as a diary, I like the fact I cn put together a meal at a restraunt in a minute and have a good handle on carbs/calories to bolus as close as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Like CarbCheck (the freeware I mentioned above), it allows you to add your own foods to its already extensive database of brandname foods and fast food restraunts.\u00a0\u00a0It costs $14 - but for that price, you get the food database CalorieKing compiles doing it's own Nutritional Tests on Brandname foods at their lab - sometimes what's on the box's nutritional label isn't as accurate as most consumers think.\u00a0\u00a0You might be surprised at how low or high you are estimating carbs.\u00a0\u00a0I was .... The software can be downloaded and tried for at least a week before it requires you to buy it and it's also available for Windows and Windows CE PDAs.Again - another software resource for someone with diabetes who (like myself) often gets frustrated and then depressed when it comes to counting carbs at mealtime.If you're a real PALM PDA techie and like to tinker with beta software, CalorieKing has a beta test Yahoo Group at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/cksoftware_betatest_palm/ ....I hope this helps someone.\u00a0\u00a0When I first was diagnosed and asked about meal planning software on various forums and newsgroups - no one said anything.\u00a0\u00a0These programs would have made my earlier days a lot less stressful.",

    "question": "To keep my mind off of Diabetes, especially like today when my Insulin Pump QuickSet didn't go in as ouchless as advertised, I am a electronic gadget/computer geek.\u00a0\u00a0Always on the lookout for something that's fun.\u00a0\u00a0I was like this before being diagnosed, so at least one thing in my life hasn't been changed even though everything else seems to have.I found two FREE applications for PALM pda users that may be of interest to some of you.The most interesting was an app called CARBCHECK by Uwe Trode and available for download at http://clix.to/peachbud.\u00a0\u00a0It's similar to Calorie King's commercial software. CARBCHECK is a no frills application but does exactly what it says - it has a database of ADA Exchanges, Fast Food, and you can even customize the database if you have Micrsoft Excel.\u00a0\u00a0You select what you want and it displays the items and their carbs on the screen in a menu format.\u00a0\u00a0It's a work in progress and at the moment can't tally up the items you choose (Trode is working on that)- but for a quick index for meal (that you can add your own items to)it works in a pinch.The other item is caled GlucoTools by James Cureington at http://glucotools.sourceforge.net.\u00a0\u00a0Again, this is a no frills free PALM pda application.\u00a0\u00a0It tracks your insulin bolus, BG readings, helps calculate correction bolus, and estimates your HbA1c.They're not sophisticated programs nor do they have pretty interfaces .... but I figured I'd share what I found with the rest of you.\u00a0\u00a0Just a few free tools for you to be aware of in case some one you know has a need.",
