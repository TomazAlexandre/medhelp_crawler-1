            "answer": "It does seem rather strange that you only get these injuries whilst on your monthly cycles.Are you eating and drinking enough and sleeping well?When you are swimming you are burning up energy.\u00a0\u00a0If you have not eaten slow release foods the hour before swimming, your sugar levels may be going to low and with this your concentration.\u00a0\u00a0Lack of fluids in the body can also cause lack of concentration.I would suggest that whilst you are on your monthly cycle, you avoid any physical activity and swimming, until you get checked out by your doctor.If you are getting a shoulder and knee problem, ask your swimming tutor to see if you are making any a wrong swimming movements.Make sure that you always warm up your muscles before getting into the water - these are specific exercises so that you do not damage any muscles or ligaments.Book an appointment to see your doctor to get a blood test done to check your iron levels and also a glucose test to see if you have a glucose intolerance, pre diabetes or diabetes.Let us know how you get on.",
