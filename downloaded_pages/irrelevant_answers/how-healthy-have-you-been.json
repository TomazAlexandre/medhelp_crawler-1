            "answer": "I have had MS for almost 3 years but so far seem to have my \"normal\" illnesses. A cold once or twice a year and stomach flu every 3-4 years.No other illnesses even when my DMD lowered my absolute lymphocytes making me immune-compromised (in flu season no less). Bodies are weird, no doubt about it.\u00a0\u00a0:)Corrie",

            "answer": "I am very lucky in that all my life I've been very healthy, way before MS came along. I had many years of school with perfect attendance. I've never had clinical measles or rubella (though I have blood markers for both). I've gone as long as 9 years without a cold. I've never had flu. Knocking on my wooden head, here.\u00a0\u00a0:-) I *have* had infections here and there, but not many.MS doesn't necessarily weaken or deplete white blood cells. It hasn't for me. And taking some of the newer DMDs doesn't block ailments; in fact, they potentially lower resistance because of their own effects on white cells. However, the DMDs target only specific cells, so do not keep us from getting ordinary infections that 'go around.'Speaking only for myself, I believe that it was relatively easier for my strong immune system to go into overdrive than it would be for most. That and a strong family history of autoimmune diseases and thus a genetic disposition made MS more likely for me.",

            "answer": "I have had MS over 50 years since I was a toddler. I had a lot of ear infections and such as a child. I had a bad mononucleosis in 2008 as well as when I was in college. I also have terminal ovarian cancer. My doctor remarks that other than that I am very healthy. I just have bad genetics the BRCA 1 mutation for ovarian and 90% chance of breast cancer. I can walk long distance, swim for an hour, or ride a horse after tacking it up. I do not get the flu and am over a cold in a couple of days.I also have a genetic chance of diabetes. My brother a triatholon has the cancer and risk of diabetes.I don't smoke. I have not had a drink since 1981 and use no drugs. I do take prescriptions. I eat well and exercise. I have most of my life. My doctor says she wishes she had more patients like me lifestyle wise not genetically.Alex",

            "answer": "Hi Deb,We've chatted about this subject a few times over the years, off the top of my head, it's not uncommon for MSers on DMD's to stop experiencing the more common ailments, apart from UTI's, i can't recall why though.Personally, many doctors have told me that i have an over active immune system or an over protective immune system eg when blood tests showed my white cell through the roof, physical reaction to cold temperatures etclol My family say out of everyone, i got the crappy immune system, when i do get sick with a bug or infection i tend to look and feel like i've been run over by a mack truck long after the signs of the bug/infect have gone. I use to work with children with disabilities, schools are a petri dish lol i use to pick up every what ever that was going, since i stopped working i don't seem to get sick anywhere near as often, just what the family bring home to share.Cheers.........JJ",

            "answer": "Depends on the DMD, at the very least. Some of the newer generation are straight-up immuno-supressants, not immuno-modulators like the orals and older injectables. I visit the hospital (home of massive germ bombs) regularly for the study I participate in, and I do pick up colds more frequently and the occasional highly unpleasant bout of gastroenteritis. But I make sure I keep my non-live vaccines up to date and frequently wash my hands, especially in situations like weddings, classrooms, sports matches, etc where I&#39;m really not able to police the hygiene or vaccine history of others. I know I&#39;m now technically in that &quot;compromised immune system&quot; category and make sure I behave accordingly.",

    "question": "This is a weird observation I have made over the last few years. Other than having MS for over 30 years and all the fun side effects it brings, I have been remarkably healthy. Other than a few random UTI's. No flux no strep throat, on real illnesses at all! (knock wood!)This surprises me because MS is an autoimmune disease which of course weakens the white blood cell count.I was wondering if this is true for others. If it is true for many of us, do you think the DMD's we take actually help our immune system by blocking these pesky typical ailments?Deb",
