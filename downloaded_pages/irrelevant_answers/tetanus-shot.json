            "answer": "Tdap is now recommended for all women around 28 weeks gestation to help protect their babies especially against pertussis, better known as whooping cough. A tetanus booster should be given at least every ten years regardless of pregnancy status but since whooping cough has made such a comeback it is very important to give that protection to our little ones. Infants can die of whooping cough. They can't get vaccines of their own right away and so it is our job to get it boost their immunity. Yes, it's safe. If it wasn't safe they wouldn't give it. You'll probably have a sore spot for a couple of days but it's well worth it considering the benefits.",
