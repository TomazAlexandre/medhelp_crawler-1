            "answer": "Most cases of non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy improve on their own without any treatment. THere is no evidence based medicine studies that show that anything helps. Generally I advise: stop smoking, lose weight, exercise, treat high blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol vigorously, take daily asprin.If you have sleep apnea important to treat with CPAP.My mother has NAION and made a full recovery from 20/200 vision right after it happened.JCH MD",

            "answer": "I suggest you ask the CPAP question on a sleep apnea forum. I do know that some of the larger masks can cause drying of the eyes.Although aspirin is over the counter you should discuss the dosage with his MD. It can run from a baby aspirin/day to 4 adult asprin/day.My mother controled her blood pressure and took asprin and did not have it in the second eye.If it happened right now I would suggest chewing an adult asprin and contacting your Eye MD immediately.JCH MD",

            "answer": "You may want to visit the yahoo NAION user group.http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/naion/?v=1&t=search&ch=web&pub=groups&sec=group&slk=1You might find that there are no documented cases within that group that reports that their NAION has been corrected by any means.\u00a0\u00a0Although the visual defect symptoms will improve, that seams to be related to the reduction of the swelling of the optic nerve and adaptation.There is an excellent article written by Dr. Brian Younge which can be found here:http://www.emedicine.com/oph/TOPIC161.HTMBetween those two and other articles, which you can do a search for, you will find much more information than you would expect to find on this board.",
