            "answer": "Hi, Matt!\u00a0\u00a0I haven't heard of repeated insulin shots in the same area causing fat deposits.\u00a0\u00a0What I've typically heard is that it will cause scar tissue to form under the skin.\u00a0\u00a0If you've been using those same sites for 10 years, and not switching around the the arms, legs, or rear end, then it's likely you've caused scar tissue to form, which may be the 'pads' you're seeing.\u00a0\u00a0Do you still get good insulin absorption in your abdomen?",

    "question": "Hi everyone.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 15 and I've had diabetes since I was 5.\u00a0\u00a0When I was diagnosed, mom told me not to take too many injections in my abdomen, but since that was the only place that didn't really hurt, i did it anyway.\u00a0\u00a0Years later, I now have stubborn pads of body fat where I used to take those injections.\u00a0\u00a0All the methods I've tried (cruches, full on sit-ups, weight lifting, etc) haven't done a thing to them.\u00a0\u00a0Is there any alternative, more effective way of getting rid of the fat pads, or is it just fat that's been mutated by the insulin and is now pretty much permanent?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks in advance for all your help!",
