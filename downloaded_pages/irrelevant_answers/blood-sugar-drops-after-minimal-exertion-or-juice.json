            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.The blood glucose values you have given are all within the normal range. It is normal for the values to go up and down throughout the day. Is it possible that there is another cause for your shaky feeling? Have you had any other symptoms? The symptoms of diabetes are frequent urination, thirst, fatigue, blurred vision, cuts/bruises, tingling/numbness of the distal extremities, frequent infections.Good luck. I hope you are feeling better soon.Cathy",

Another 15 minutes it will be 5-10 points higher still (again, no food/juice).",

    "question": "Hello, I have not been diagnosed with diabetes. I have been testing my blood sugar at home the last couple of months. I noticed that commonly I would suddenly feel very hungry after 15 minutes of light-to-moderate exercise. This happens no matter how much I eat or when before-hand.An example of a particularly dramatic drop: blood sugar 137 before exercising. After 15 minutes light-to-moderate exercise, it was 85. This happens all the time, dropping from wherever it is, to the 70-80 range. One time I felt particularly shaky and the reading was 65.What's worse is that I am getting these drops from even minimal physical activity. As an example: blood sugar 110, after walking at a slow pace (strolling) for a mere 10 minutes, I start to feel a little shaky and my sugar is 78. I realize it may not be the absolute number, but the drops, that is causing the shakiness.It is becoming that I am afraid to exercise, and I am taking dried fruit strips with me whenever I go outside, as the feeling is very unsettling.Does anyone have an idea of what could cause this? I brought it up to my GI doctor, but because I presented so many numbers (more than these here), he put me in the \"worrying about nothing\" category. I'm waiting for an appointment with my general practitioner but was hoping to get some info in the meantime.Also, not sure this is related, but the feeling was similar: my sugar was 108. I drank 8 ounces of fruit juice (mostly papaya), and felt almost immediately disoriented. My blood sugar had dropped to 89. What would cause blood sugar to drop almost immediately after drinking fruit juice? And I realized that this must happen often, because in the past I would sometimes sip fruit juice and have a similar feeling. (So no more fruit juice for me!)I hope someone can point me in the right direction as to why this may be happening! I appreciate any and all replies! Thank you.",
