            "answer": "Well I have the same thing, I am 29 weeks and 5 days. As of right now they are just going to monitor me. I failed both glucose test and even with that they will just monitor me. I am now having weekly ultrasound versus two weeks to monitor fluid. I will monitor my sugar at home as well\u00a0\u00a0and unless anything\u00a0\u00a0extremely concerning then I will see an endocrinologist. Until then just monitor what you eat. Unless the fluid increases they don't seem to concerned. Good luck.",
