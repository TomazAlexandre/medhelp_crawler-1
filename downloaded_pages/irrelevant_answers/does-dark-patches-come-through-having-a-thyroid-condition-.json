            "answer": "I read once that thyroid replacement can cause the skin to be more sun sensitive and more prone to burns and pigments.I myself had two wax burns and they resulted in bad pigments but they've healed now though.You should find a good dermatologist or esthetician to help treat your pigment before it's too late. I would wear sun screen and avoid sun and of course tan beds!",
