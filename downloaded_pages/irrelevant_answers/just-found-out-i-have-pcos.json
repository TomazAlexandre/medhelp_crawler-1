            "answer": "Hey, first off take a deep breath and relax. I too have pcos but i have irregular periods and am overweight. What my doctor did was put me on 2000 mg of metformin. It is a pre diabetes drug but also regulates you hormonally. I have my first . Last week and it been 6 months before i haf one. Also there is a drug called clomid and it acts as an ovulation. It is devastating to hear and it does hurt espesically when all you ever wanted was kids\u00a0\u00a0im in the same boat. My advice get all you hormens tested fsh, th, throid blood sugar etc and mention clomid or metformin to your doctor. I dont know if you reside in the U.S.but still mention them. I dont have any other\u00a0\u00a0symptoms besides the overweoght. I have one cyst on my ovary a long time ago but they never mentioned more then that one. Good luck and im here if you ned a budy etc:)",

I found out I had it from an internal pelvis scan but I dont have any of the symptoms that I have read people get from having PCOS. Has anyone had it with no symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0I have regular periods, wouldn't say I was over weight (50kg and 160cm), I dont have excessive hair anywhere it shouldn't be.\u00a0\u00a0Im confused!
