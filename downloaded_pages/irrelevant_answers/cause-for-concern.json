            "answer": "Just because it may look a little swollen doesn't mean anything. I fell for this hype and obsession with thyroid nodules, and had a lobectomy on October 22, that I regret and would give anything to have never had. I can only pray my voice and breath control will completely recover...as well as horrible anxiety and depression as a result. Go to your GP and have your levels checked if it makes you feel better and if they are good, my advice is to leave your healthy body alone.",
