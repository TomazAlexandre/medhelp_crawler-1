            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Headache, fever and rash are mainly due to viral pathology. However in your son\u2019s case the symptoms are far apart, except for the rash and fever. These are also signs of meningitis, but that is a more serious condition and will not linger for so long without serious repercussions. Diabetes should definitely be looked into. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is another possibility. Refractive errors of the eye should also be looked into. Fungal infections too should be investigated.Hope this helps. Do discuss these possibilities with your son\u2019s pediatrician.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "my sons fever and rash went away after a few days. i took him off the nasonex. i wasnt sure about the viral pathology but he was tested when he was little for diabetes.neg. i had already looked into rocky mountain and his symptoms dont match up.he was at the eye doctor when this all started because of the headaches. they found nothing but a little allergy reaction to something. the ear nose throat doctor was the one who put him on the nasonex, every thing else checked out with him too.i didnt think it was meningitis becouse my family doctor checked his glands and neck stiffness.i do know that he did have the fungas on his scalp but i wasnt sure about all the other problems if they could be related to that also. his sores in his mouth and his scalp seem to be better but now he is complaining off a headach again.maybe a side affect from taking him off the nasonex??? he seems very nervous all the time so i thought that could be do to the nasonex also. please let me know what you think. take care.",
