            "answer": "TSH of 3.7 I assume is within your Labs reference range. However if you are not feeling well I would ask doctor to up meds to the next dose and see if you feel better or worse.\u00a0\u00a0Also would suggest to have the FT-4 and FT-3 done along with the TSH because they might be the problem and not your TSH..TPOs are mainly associated with thyroid autoimmune disorders and with thyroid cancers. However, TPO Antibodies assay may occur in organ-specific autoimmune diseases, including pernicious anemia, Addison's disease, type I diabetes mellitus , polyglandular endocrine failure syndromes etc.\u00a0\u00a0There is a tendency for individuals with higher autoantibody levels to be more susceptible to autoimmune hypothyroidism (Hashi), but low concentrations are also found in a significant percentage of the normal population.TPOs will rise if you've had vaccines or are being exposed to something you're allergic to, such as eating gluten when you have gluten sensitivityThere are not really any lifestyle changes or therapies that can prevent or eliminate thyroid antibodies.\u00a0\u00a0That is, nothing can be done about the antibodies for they are not curable nor treatable. Its the thyroid that is treated from the damages done by the TPOs.\u00a0\u00a0So don't be too concerned with Antibodies, its the thyroid and levels to be concerned about.GLGRAVESDISEASEANDRAI/home.msnw",

            "answer": "I wonder if you might be able to help me to better understand what can be done about all of my symptoms. I believe I have (undiagnosed) Hashimoto's but have many symptoms of hyperthyroidism as well. If my thyroid and energy levels are going back and fourth, what kind of treatment can be given?I alternate with hyper and hypo symptoms every few days...and it worsens with my menstrual cycle. Not to mention, I have had a tightness in my neck (thyroid region) for years, a feeling of pressure there, a feeling of mucous build-up in the left thyroid area, my voice is always hoarse, and I feel a strange pressure under my left collarbone, too.Those symptoms are on top of the alternating high and low energy levels, muscle pain, mood changes, body temperature changes, insomnia alternating with exhaustion, muscle weakness, and more...Thank you for explaining any tests I should ask for, and explaining any treatment that can be given to get me well. Are the Dr's just going to wait until my thyroid burns itself out or is there something that can be given to BALANCE me out??Thank u so much for any help and advice u can offer to me!Kimberly:)",
