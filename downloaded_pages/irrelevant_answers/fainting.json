            "answer": "Dear Rosablanca:Sorry to hear about your mother. It is difficult to tell you what happened to your mother.\u00a0\u00a0Such a long time of loss of consciousness is not a simple vagal response.\u00a0\u00a0A simple fainting spell is not a good explanation for what happened. Unless your mother fainted and her head hit a rock and she had a concussion.\u00a0\u00a0This I can't tell.\u00a0\u00a0The more logical explanation is stroke or epilepsy.\u00a0\u00a0A small stroke could certainly do this, as well as a seizure event.Sorry that I am not much help.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

            "answer": "Hi :My mom really fell hard. She fell on the road and hit her face, all the impact of the fall was received by her face. She said it was all so sudden that she could not put her arms to protect herself from the fall and that the scary part.She needed more that 40 stitches. She lost a little piece of her tongue and she needed a lot of stitches under her jaw line. She says she can remember just bit and pieces between the falling and \"really\" waking up at the hospital after the doctors took care of her.I really thought this was a \"neurological\" matter since three weeks previous to this accident she went through a surgical procedure (face lift) and her heart checked out \"fine\" and she said she has feeling just fine before she lost consciousness. Is your answer still the same ? or can you be a little more specific ? Do you agree that is a \"neurological\" matter ?What tests can you suggest she does to find out what happened ?Thank you very much for your prompt response !Rosablanca.",

            "answer": "My father is seventy-four years of age, a diabetic (takes insulin injections), has a history of heart problems (bypass, stroke, angioplasty), and had a pacemaker implanted last year.\u00a0\u00a0Dad has had problems keeping his blood sugar levels within normal limits.\u00a0\u00a0He eats well (lives with my sister) and does get some exercise, but not enough.\u00a0\u00a0He is not overweight.\u00a0\u00a0He has high blood pressure.A couple of weeks ago, Dad had two car accidents (no longer driving now).\u00a0\u00a0In both cases his blood sugar levels were recorded at under thirty.\u00a0\u00a0Luckily, neither he nor anyone else was injured.\u00a0\u00a0His family doctor ordered at CT Scan of his head.\u00a0\u00a0The scan showed that Dad has had a stroke.\u00a0\u00a0Can diabetes (low sugar in particular) trigger a stroke?\u00a0\u00a0Can a stroke trigger low blood sugar?\u00a0\u00a0Can you point me in the direction of further information relating to this subject?Thank you for any help/advice.",

            "answer": "Dear Nancy:As I was reading your posting I was thinking this gentleman had a stroke or seizure, and sure enough your father had a stroke.\u00a0\u00a0The diabetes is one cause of stroke, as the lipid level is high and athroscleroisis is usually prominant, especially in the uncontrolled diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, high blood pressure is another risk factor.\u00a0\u00a0Heart disease is also another risk factor. The stroke (was it ischemic? what territory of vessel was it in?) was not due to low blood sugar but likely the high blood pressure, athrosclerois, and heart problems.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

    "question": "My mom is a healthy 68 year old lady, active and in very good shape.She lives in South America up in the mountains (above 7 thousand feet). One day she was taking a walk with some friends and all of the sudden she fainted. She says that she did not see it coming because she was feeling just fine, She was not dizzy or cold. Her heart felt fine, she just ate lunch half an hour ago. It was so sudden that she could not even strech her arms to protect her body/face. Her face was heavily damaged. She described the event like \"the switch, it was turned off\" and she woke up about 1.5 hours later. She kind of remembers when they put her in the car to take her to the hospital, but everything is very blurry.She does not know what happened. This is the first time in her life that something like this happen and she is afraid it might happen again. What can you tell me about it ? Do you have any suggestions ?. I am also afraid this could happen again when she is driving and the consequences could be fatal !. Thanks a lot !",
