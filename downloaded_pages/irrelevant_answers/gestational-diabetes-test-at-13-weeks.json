            "answer": "This is so confusing to me. I do not know of anyone else who had to take the test so early. I know I was still ++ with my first pregnancy and didnt test until way later on and it was negative. So confused. The problem is that my first visit with my actual OB will not be until right after I take this test. I dont know that she would have even wanted me to have done this. Just frustrated and confused. Do not need the stress of this test right now.",

    "question": "Hello,Today I am going to the doctor for my 13 week checkup and the mid wife I seen during my first official appointment requested that I take the test early for gestational diabetes. I am on the heavier side so I guess I understand but with my first pregnancy I did not have it and am concerned if there is anything else I should be worried about. I am nervous beyond belief as I really do not want to have any complications and feel that taking this test early is a sign that they saw something. Has anyone else had to take the test early? Any feelings on why besides weight, that I would have to take it so early?",
