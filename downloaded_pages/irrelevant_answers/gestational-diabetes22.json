            "answer": "Relax.....too much stress on baby is a good thing. One hour gkucose tests are known to be wrong that is why they do a 3 hour. I failed the one hour with 2 pregnancies but passed the 3 houir. And if you do have gestational diabetes you have a great chance of having a normal healthy baby. You doctors will set you up with a nutritionist and as long as you follow all reccomendations you have a good prognosis. It is common for baby to be a little on the larger side but it does not mean baby is unhealthy. Dont get too stressed......make sure you follow the directions exactly for your next test. One of the biggest reasons the 1 hour is inaccurate is many moms eat or drink when they are not supposed to or the lab performs the test incorrectly. Good luck and congrats on your pregnancy!!",

            "answer": "Thanks, yeah I did eat sugary stuff so I am now a tad afraid of this.I keep reading about it but all I get is the same info.But no one seems to say what are the chances of beating the diabetes and having a healthy baby. All I get are facts on what it does and how the baby can be born big and with respiratory problems. All it does is worry me.Maybe if they gave us hopes and stats on how many people have healthy babies after maintaining their diet it would be a lot less stressing.I really hope that my tests are better on Monday. I really hope me eating cinnamon bread and a choclate-bannana muffin is the reason why my levels were so high.I called them and they said it has no baring on my test. Although what i've read says otherwise. I'll be careful and hope for the best. I worry easy and I don't want to feel aweful for potention issues with my baby.",

            "answer": "Only about 20percent of women who take the 1hr and have high sugars have gestational diabetes. I threw up the 3 hour drink so they tested my fasting blood and said I don't have gd. The 3 hour test is a process quite like the 1 hour. You first get your blood (fasting blood) before you drink the sugar glucose drink. After you drink it you will get your blood tested every hour for 3 hours. You're diagnosed if 2/3 (after fasting) or 3/4 including fasting (this is different depending on testing center) come back with high sugar levels. You can fix it with a diet. If the diet doesn't work you may be given insulin- but the diet usually works. Don't worry though:)",

            "answer": "Every baby has the possibility of getting any problem related to gestational diabetes though. It's not your fault! When were getting bigger we don't have much stomach room which causes our body to not have a lot of room to break down our sugars which can cause high sugar levels in any pregnant woman. Even if you have gestational diabetes then don't worry because many people have had healthy babies with it!",

            "answer": "I actually just failed my 1 hour test. My levels were high enough that my dr is not having me take the 3 hour test, she's sending me straight to the diabetes education. I did take the 3 hour test with my first pregnancy and I passed, but that time I'd only failed my first test by a few points.I'm not worrying too much at this point. I expect to have a healthy baby, if you do have GD just make sure to follow the nutritional guidelines and monitor yourself carefully! It doesn't mean anything will be wrong with your baby or even that the baby will be huge. I'm just crossing my fingers that I won't end up on insulin! Poking my finger is gonna be hard enough for me! Mot a fan of needles. Good luck, take something to eat when the test is over and if you tend to pass out or anything during blood draws don't go alone!",

What can happen to my baby?If I cut the sugars and eat right will I be able to help the baby or is it too late?All I knew about this before is that the baby can be large (which I do not want) or premature.has anyone had gestational diabetes and had a normal baby?
