If just a regular doctor, but he or she is managing you okay and you feel good in their hands, that should be fine-an endocrinologist is usually more experienced (but in *my* experience, endos seem to be more about diabetes and are woefully misinformed about thyroid.) but if one is recommended to you, it couldn't hurt to see one to see if they have suggestions.",
