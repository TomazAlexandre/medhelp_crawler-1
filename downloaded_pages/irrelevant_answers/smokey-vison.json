            "answer": "You could be experiencing dry eyes. Try an OTC artifical tear drop.\u00a0\u00a0Also, flourescent lighting is horrible on the eyes...try not to look at them. In addition, do see your eye doctor. Let them know you have dry eyes when you call to make the appointment...that way your medical insurance will be billed, not your vision insurance.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Gel eye drops are great AT NIGHT before bed. Otherwise you'll have blurred vision, because it is a gel and much more thick in your eyes.\u00a0\u00a0Ask your pharamcist whats the best artificial tear for the money.If you wear make up...maybe its time to throw out your exixting mascara, eyeliner, etc...and get all new, hypoallergenic ones. Also, if you wear mascara that is waterproof...switch to washable.\u00a0\u00a0The chemicals can play havoc on your eyes. You may also want to try specific vitamins for eye health...again, ask a pharmacist what is good.Good luck!!",

    "question": "On ocasion, I have noticed that when I have looked up at the ceiling (flourescent lighting), that the room looks as if it is filled with smoke. It stays that way all day long and usually the next day it's better. Do you think it is lack of oxygen on my eyes? No I don't wear contacts but I do wear glasses and I sleep with a fan at night.Could my eyes be getting dryed out from the fan at night?",
