            "answer": "You can have labs done that show results \"within lab limits\" and still be undermedicated. It is not a matter of the tests being wrong, it is a matter of the doctor not knowing how to read the test results.It happens all the time, and many suffer for years because their doctor does not see a flag on the result calling it low or high.Hopefully your Endo will know something about thyroids, rather than diabetes, and will see that you need an increase.You probably need a fresh ultrasound before you start asking your Endo about the need for an FNA or other tests or treatment.",

I am going through almost the exact same symptoms, and being told i'm basically making it all up in my head. I have the redness around my neck, exhaustion,pain in muscles, weakness in arms and legs, forgetfulness, mental fog. I have trouble swallowing and feel something in my throat. If you have found any help or at least a diagnosis , I would love to hear about it. If not , we could at least compare notes.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with a multinodular goiter about 5 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0At the time, all of my thyroid panel blood tests wereshowing values within the norm range.

Ifinally asked if I could have a thyroid scan performed.\u00a0\u00a0He agreed.\u00a0\u00a0I was called and told I had a multinodular goiter.I was started on Levothyroxine 75mcg.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms got somewhat better, but not alot.\u00a0\u00a0I have started having frequentproblems swallowing, especially water and tea.\u00a0\u00a0I get choked alot.\u00a0\u00a0I also have a sensation when I'm swallowing of a lump in the left side of my throat.\u00a0\u00a0When I turn my head sharply to the left,\u00a0\u00a0I have a sensation of something pushingin on my throat at the base.\u00a0\u00a0My fluid retention, hair falling out, and fatigue have exacerbated again.\u00a0\u00a0Now I'm havingsevere muscle pain, also.\u00a0\u00a0My neck always looks red or 'sunburned' appearance.\u00a0\u00a0My thyroid blood tests have remained in the norm throughout all of this.\u00a0\u00a0What should I do?\u00a0\u00a0Are there any specific tests I should be requesting?Should I ask for a fine needle biopsy on the nodules?\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms are significantly affecting my life.\u00a0\u00a0I feel likeI'm dragging a one-ton truck around on my back all day.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I'm in a fog mentally.\u00a0\u00a0I forget things easily.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor has talked about referring me to Mayo Clinic.\u00a0\u00a0I live in Oklahoma, so that's quite a haul for me.\u00a0\u00a0Is there something I need to be asking my doctor that I'm missing?\u00a0\u00a0I recently got established with an endocrinologist.THANKS FOR YOUR TIME,Cooncreek 8487",
