And it's red blood cells that absorb glucose once it enters the blood stream.Here's some basics on how to control and manage glucose levels. Not much can be added since you didn't tell us anything about your diabetes, if any. Nor do I recommend medication/s as this is up to a doctor following an evaluation.\u25cf Eat a healthy nutrition of lean meats, poultry, fish, whole grains, fresh vegetables and limited amounts of fruits.\u25cf Avoid manufactured canned and packaged foods. Restrict carbohydrate foods. Restrict foods made with white flour. Avoid starchy foods like potatoes and white rice. These food groups will jack up your glucose levels.\u25cf Maintain a healthy normal body weight. If overweight by a \u2018few\u2019 pounds/kilos, lose the fat\u25cf Maintain a healthy normal lipid panel\u25cf Perform 30 minutes of physical exercise daily - minimum.

            "answer": "Let me add to the \"no exercise\". After further thought, no exercise over 250 mg/dl comes to mind if ketones are present in the urine because you will further increase ketones in your blood which then may lead to DKA [diabetic ketoacidosis]. DKA can lead to serious health consequences such as coma.",
