            "answer": "My friend disagreed with her estimated due date but she said in the end it didn't matter because the dr works off the date they give you in your early scans. If your measuring a bit bigger, you're probably having a big healthy baby unless the dr has talked to you about gestational diabetes. As for kicking, if you're concerned you're not feeling as many kicks it could be because she is running out of room, if you feel a significant difference there's no harm in calling your dr and talking to them about your concerns. Congratulations and good luck!",
