            "answer": "Dear newly diagnosed,I am not a medical professional so I can only share my personal opinion and limited knowledge with you and this is what comes to mind. What does it mean that your blood sugar is kept at 9 without insulin?\u00a0\u00a0I don't believe you can have Type 1 diabetes and not take insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Your body needs insulin to survive even if you don't eat.\u00a0\u00a0Also, it is not a good idea to stay on a no carb diet for a long period of time as you can harm your kidneys.\u00a0\u00a0Did your doctor definitely say Type 1 or could it have been Type 2.\u00a0\u00a0With Type 1 diabetes and no insulin your body will start to burn fat for energy and you could end up with DKA or diabetic ketoacidosis, which could be very serious.\u00a0\u00a0Also, it will be very hard to gain weight without eating carbs.\u00a0\u00a0If this would be Type 2 diabetes, it would make sense to cut back on carbs but not cut them out totally.\u00a0\u00a0And don't forget if you are newly diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, you are probably still in your honeymoon phase and will eventually need more insulin than you do right now.Please be careful.Carol",

            "answer": "Dear pesto,Are you from Canada (in regard to the number 9 you were speaking of)? I know from other postings we have a different numeric system in the U.S. I apologize if I am making an incorrect asumption. I am also wondering if you are speaking about an a1c number. I am also not a physician but agree with cd. If you have type 1 diabetes, you will need insulin as your beta cells in your pancreas are not producing the insulin you need. Have you experienced thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision or excessive hunger? The fact that you are 20 lbs underweight is one sign of type 1. But like cd, I am also wondering if you were diagnosed with type 1 or 2 diabetes. At your age it is normally type 1 and if it is I would recommend that you see an endocrinologist if you are not already.I also agree with cd that you are very possibly in a honeymoon stage and will need insulin.Please know that in any case we are here for you and will give you any support that we can. Please let us know how you are doing. Keep in touch.dm",

            "answer": "Hello Pesto,For many newly diagnosed Type 1s, we go thru what's called honeymoon period during which our pancreas still can produce some insulin to help us along.\u00a0\u00a0Eventually, however, for all Type 1s, the cells that produce die and we must take insulin by injection or pump to stay alive.It's a good idea to be followed by diabetes specialist: an endocrinologist or diabetologist.\u00a0\u00a0They are experts in treating our disease.\u00a0\u00a0Many of us also benefit from working with a certified diabetes educator (usually not a physician, but someone who work as part of our team).I was diagnosed as a teen, and now 35 years later I am healthy (except for diabetes, that is).\u00a0\u00a0I have always strived to live a full & rich life without letting this disease get in my way.\u00a0\u00a0You can do that too, if you learn learn learn all you can about this disease and how to work with a team of medical professionals.\u00a0\u00a0There is a lot to learn and I'd encourage you to visit the JDRF website (http://www.jdrf.org) to gradually build your knowledge and also to get support.Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0Do stay in touch, okay?",

    "question": "I have recently been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, but the blood sugars seem to\u00a0\u00a0be kept at 9 without insulin, that's because my diet has very few carbs e.g. I eat no sugars, baked goods, rice, pasta or potatoes. I eat a lot of protein and vegetables. The specialist seems to think that this is ok, however, my weight is about 20lbs less than it should be. My blood sugars seem fairly stable. I am 19 years old. Is there any danger without carbs in my diet?",
