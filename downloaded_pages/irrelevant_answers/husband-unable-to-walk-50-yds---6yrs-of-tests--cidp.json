            "answer": "Many thanks for your post...we live in England and have never heard of Lyme's disease here, although have encountered it\u00a0\u00a0with a business colleague in New York state.Thanks for your input, still think it is CIDP - talked to hubby today and he is going to get an urgent consult with our GP Monday and for a private consult with a different neurologist,who is specialised in neuro-muscular problems -will probably get an appt within a week - we hav socialised medicine here in England although pay through our taxes) could take 6 months on ther NHS. I think there is an ageism problem which a friend who is a GP said there is , so \"no pockets in shrouds\" syndrome, just want my husband, and me, to have a better quality of life.So good to hear of someone who cares...thank you.Liz.",

    "question": "Hi - my husband is now 79 yrs and for past 6 yrs has had difficulty walking more than 50 yds. He says his body goes leaden from the waist down and he is unable to move his legs.\u00a0\u00a0Both feet are numb and neuropathy has spread half way up his legs. He gets very dizzy, sweating,\u00a0\u00a0muscular weakness on walking even 50 yds. We have seen many specialists:Cardiologist:\u00a0\u00a0angiogram, blocked artery, been there long time, but other smaller arteries have taken over. Recent ECG \"unremarkable\".Vascular Surgeon: 6 yrs ago - angioplasty, stent put in right leg for pvd.. Recent consult: Circulation slightly impaired, but not cause of problem. Referred to neurosurgeon for suspected spinal canal stenosis.Neurosurgeon - also strongly suspected spinal canal stenosis; 2 MRI's showed mild scs, surgeon said not the cause and said neurological in origin. Referred to Neurologist.Neurologist - after cursory consultation referred to neurophysicist for nerve conduction tests on feet and lower legs.\u00a0\u00a0Neurologist reported: \"test consistent with sensory-motor,predominantly sensory, axonal peripheral neuropathy although the neurophysicist felt this may not fully explain all of the patient's problems.\"4 sessions with private chiropractor - some age degeneration in top part of spine. Advised, after reading MRI reports, that he could do no more as neurological problem.Recent consult 2 weeks ago with Neurologist - unable to give definitive diagnosis, ordered multitude blood tests. When pressed, suggested \"may be fibromyalgia or diabetes\". Husband has no pain on walking and has had diabetes tests frequently over the years. Blood test results not available as yet.We really are depressed over no definitive dx and/or treatment. None of his doctors have given us any hope and indeed have said we should just accept the situation at this age. We are not prepared to, until we have exhausted all avenues. Our lifestyle is severely curtailed. Husband is on medication for high cholesterol and takes Adalat, bendroflumethiazide, Simvastatin and aspirin. He has no mental faculty problems whatsoever.I today read an article in a national newspaper, mentioning a male, 79 yrs old, with walking problems - dx Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and symptoms seem very similar.What further tests can be done to get a definitive diagnosis and treatment?Any advice deeply appreciated.Liz.",
