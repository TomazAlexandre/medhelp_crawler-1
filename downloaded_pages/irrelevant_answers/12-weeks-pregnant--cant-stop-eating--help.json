            "answer": "I gained 30 lbs by week 18, due to insatiable hunger in the first trimester. I'm normally a size 3 and dont gain easily, but boy when I'm pregnant I gain a lot. I dont suffer from morning sickness, main symptom is hunger. I felt like I was never full. Now at 24 weeks it has calmed down a lot, a little late since im way past the total amount i should have gained for entire pregnancy. Oh well. Anyway, completly normal.",

            "answer": "From wk like 16-23 I had a crazy appitite and was gaining about 2lbs a wk. My doctors fine with my weight gain for now. I've gained a total, well last time I got on the scale... which I hate to do, I had gained 20lbs and that was last Thursday at the doctors office. Now I'm about to wk 24 and my appitite is slowing down a little, which is good. Thank GOD!! But yeah don't feel bad. Just follow doctors instructions and try to eat healthy stuff too. Fruit is great. I can't keep it in my house. When I get a late night hunger pain I go get a apple or some strawberries. Plus you feel better when you eat good stuff, you tend to feel less yucky and bloated. Good luck.",
