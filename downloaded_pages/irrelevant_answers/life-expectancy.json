            "answer": "Actually from all I have read, most likely if their heart is strong then they will actually drown because their lungs get so full that no air will be able to get in.\u00a0\u00a0If we are extrememly lucky, they will go in their sleep without a struggle.\u00a0\u00a0Too many\u00a0\u00a0times my mother has come close and believe me to see the fear in her eyes because she cannot get a breath is heart breaking. My mother has had heart trouble and several other problems that would normally take a persons life but the doctors tell us that it will be her lungs that fail before anything else.\u00a0\u00a0My mom's lungs are so full that you can hear her \"rattling\" clear across the room with every breath she tries to take. So what do I do? Get so stressed that after the attack and she is resting I go outside for a smoke off all things",
