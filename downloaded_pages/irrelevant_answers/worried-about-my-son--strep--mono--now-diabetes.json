    "question": "Hi,My 6y old son is recovering from strep and mono (diagnosed about 6 days ago.\u00a0\u00a0Before the mono diagnosis they did a urine test to check for diabetes since he was having such a slow recovery from strep. The urine test was negative. The next day they tested and came up positive for mono, explaining the lengthy time to recover from strep.\u00a0\u00a0Now, a couple of days later, he is urinating very frequently. I had a bg meter at home and decided to test him.\u00a0\u00a0It was about 4 hours after his morning cereal and it came back at 124.\u00a0\u00a0Is this normal?\u00a0\u00a0Could the frequent urination be from the mono or recovery?Thanks for any advice you can provide!",
