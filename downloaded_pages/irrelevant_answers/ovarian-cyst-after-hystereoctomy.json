            "answer": "Hi,I had a hysterectomy in 2002 but still have my ovaries and have had cysts on and off since then, so I am watching and waiting I guess until I am a tiny bit older and then will have surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I am 39.I wonder why your Doctor is scheduling surgery for May. What sort of surgery?\u00a0\u00a0Is he just assuming that your pain is from scarring?\u00a0\u00a0Have you had u/s or tvus or any other tests done? Do you know for sure that you have a cyst on your ovary.You have not mentioned your age.\u00a0\u00a0I guess if you are having ongoing problems and you are post menopausal then an option would be to have your other ovary removed.If you could post a little bit more information you may get some more defined answers.Good luck and keep us posted.\u00a0\u00a0Love and prayers to ya...Peace....Kim",
