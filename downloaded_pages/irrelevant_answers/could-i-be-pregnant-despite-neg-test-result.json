    "question": "Hi. I'm 23yrs old and sexually active. I've missed 3 periods now (I never skip periods) and continue to get false reads on urine pregnancy tests. I'm also tired all the time, I've gained weight, I have breast tenderness, and cramping/gas issues. I went to my OBGYN and she also gave me a pregnancy test that was negative. She prescribed estrogen for five days to induce a period and that hasn't worked either.Could I still be pregnant?",
