            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The symptoms in your case could be due to spinal nerve compression in the lumbo-sacral region. This can occur due to spondylosis, narrowing of root canal, bulging disc, reduced disc space, tumors etc. A MRI of the region can help you diagnose this.Paresthesias or abnormal sensations also can be due to peripheral neuropathies related to diabetes, thyroid disorders, Lyme's or lupus should also be ruled out.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

    "question": "For past few months have had a fluttering sensation in my lower back on left side just above hip. Fluttering seems to move in an upwards motion.No pain. Any idea as to what could be the cause? It does feel as though it could be muscular but it's been coming and going for so long now i'm concerned it may be something more serious.",
