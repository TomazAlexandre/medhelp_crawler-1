            "answer": "And I thought my $1000 deductable was bad! Sorry to hear this. I have \"met my deductable for a few years in a row now and spent thousands over that!It is funny (not) how the insurance company can reduce the price if it is submitted to them. My labs for TSH and free t4 would cost me $246.81 if I didn't go through insurance. The final amount the lab will get is $28.20. BCBS disallows $218.61 !Luckily I work for Quest and don't even have to pay for that.Something is not right here.",

    "question": "I need to vent!!!!!\u00a0\u00a0I hope you don't mind.I have been feeling like complete **** for about 2 years.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 29 year old female.\u00a0\u00a0The first dr's were dumb and missed the problem.\u00a0\u00a0I now see an endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0I found out I have type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't feel a great connection with my first endocrinologist and I found another one in the area that is very friendly and thorough.\u00a0\u00a0She ordered lots of blood work and a thyroid sonogram.\u00a0\u00a0The blood work came back indicating I needed to have a MRI of pituitary gland with and without contrast, but she wanted me to check with insurance on it first.My insurance only covers it if the $2000 deductible has been met first!!!! So, I have to pay out of pocket pricing which will likely be better than help from insurance knocking the price down for them being \"in network\".\u00a0\u00a0As if I wasn't stressed enough about having to pay for it, I got a bill yesterday from the hospital for the thyroid sonogram (which by the way came back completely normal) for $600.This blows.\u00a0\u00a0I just don't want to spend this kindof money on these things.\u00a0\u00a0I like to hord my money and spend it on fun things.
