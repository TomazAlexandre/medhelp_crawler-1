            "answer": "Hi - I have never used tobacco and I rarely drink anymore starting in about August (1-2 beers MAYBE every few nights if that). BUT I did drink a lot before August. I smoke a little weed NOW, but none at all when this first started happening or when it progressed.My physical exams always come back positive. I'm almost positive, ever since the first time I had trouble getting it up, that this is all in my head. Whenever its getting to the point of sex, I'm always worrying about my erection... So it has to be that. At least I would think so.. Its just really frustrating and starting to really worry me.",

            "answer": "Stop masturbating so often and try not to worry about it.You are right in that worrying about it is in fact making matters worse for you and the more you think about it, it won't happen.Relax and go with the flow.\u00a0\u00a0If you still continue to have this problem, after not masturbating and relaxing, do make an appointment with your doctor to discuss this with him as you may have an underlying medical problem.There are many reasons why men lose their erections, from tiredness, worry, stress, anxiety, medications that they may be taking and of course if you are drunk the mind may be willing, but \"Percy\" won't be able to deliver.",

    "question": "Hi everyone. I'm posting here because I am very worried about something that has happened to me within the past 8 monthsIt starts when me and my gf of 6 yrs broke up. It was a bad relationship, and I rarely finished during intercourse but, I was able to keep an erection. After we broke up I started masturbating more. Probably 3 times a day on average (sometimes less, sometimes more). Erections were strong and I was able to finish. My problems started when i was really drunk and I took this girl to my friends place after a night at the bars. It got to the point where we were about to have sex and I couldn't get it up. I played it off like I was too drunk but in reality it really worried me, as I've never experienced that before. I continued to masturbate.The months following, with every girl I would bring home, I'd lose my erection right when we were about to have sex.\u00a0\u00a0It started to get the point where I'd have weak erections even when masturbating sometimes, only getting fully erect when I was about to finish. I can get erect of they go down or me or sometimes during foreplay, but it just never seems as strong of an erection. Admittedly, I think I can get strong erections when I masturbate and don't think about it.Now I'm with a girl and I can stay hard enough is most positions, but not rock hard unless We are doing doggy style. Just recently, the passed two times, I couldn't keep it up at all no matter what. Which really started to worry me. Now I'm afraid next time I see her it's going to happen again too.I have a feeling half of it is in my head, the other half from masturbating / watching too much porn? I'm not sure I'm really worried this is irreversible and I won't be able to have a successful sex life. Most of the time instead of actually being excited for sex, I'm worrying about my erection and if I'll be able to actually get one.Any help would be great fully appreciatedThank you.",
