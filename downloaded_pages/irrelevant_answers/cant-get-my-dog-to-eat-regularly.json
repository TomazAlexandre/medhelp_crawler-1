            "answer": "It sounds to me like there is a reason for his lack of interest in food. It could be either pain...nausea... It's unlikely a dog will refuse food generally(even a dog who isn't exercised very much) unless he feels unwell in some way.Has he always been this way -picky with his food? Or has this come on recently?My advice would be to get him a complete blood-screening, just to see if all his organs are working as well as they should be. There may be some imbalances in liver or kidneys, he may even have some underlying issue such as diabetes...you can't know. But the blood screening (Senior Blood Panel) should show up if anything is wrong. Then you and your vet can take it from there.",
