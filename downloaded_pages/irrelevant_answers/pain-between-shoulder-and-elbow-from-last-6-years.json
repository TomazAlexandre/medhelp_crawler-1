            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Upper arm pain can be due to pinched cervical nerves. This cannot be detected on X-rays. Nerve conduction studies and MRI of the spine detects this. You have been to occupational therapists. A chiropractor can help you. Ideally you should consult a neurologist and then consult a good physiotherapist. A combined treatment approach by the two may help.The second possibility is peripheral neuropathy as seen in diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You have had blood tests so diabetes must have been ruled out. Also hypothyroidism needs to be ruled out. Tendonitis or a muscle injury during a stretch can also be the cause. Check if there are any painful pressure points. If there are then you would need to consult a physiotherapist or a chiropractor regarding that.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage on net without examining. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
