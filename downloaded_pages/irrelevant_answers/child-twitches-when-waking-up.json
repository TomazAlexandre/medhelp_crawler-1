            "answer": "Hi RudyV, It is quite common as a mother to be worried about child\u2019s sleep but does she feel the same? At this age fairly they are tuned for a good night's sleep but stress due to illness or studies can cause the sleep deprivation. It is important to keep her glucose level under normal range. As these twitches are occurring on and off now, it is better you take her for an evaluation with a neurologist and also get a sleep study done. Does she have a regular daytime sleep and how active she is otherwise? Do you feel she is able to sleep without you comfortably or feels scared to sleep alone? Give her an early dinner and follow a routine time to put her to sleep with some soft music or her favorite novel. Warm bath and gentle massage at bedtime can be soothing. Observe for some more time or else see a Pediatrician, take care.",

            "answer": "Hi RudyV, Thanks for the reply and hope your daughter is doing well? Do relax, if neurological examination had turned out normal. Had an EEG done anytime? When did neurologist last see her? It is also better to get her evaluated by a sleep specialist. Stress and lack of sleep can trigger these jerks so she needs to relax and avoid too many extra hours of studies at night and going to bed late. If she can get a daytime nap it may be helpful. Do continue to give her gentle massages and warm shower before sleep. Weekend short outings might be refreshing and relaxing. Take care and share your thoughts.",

    "question": "My daughter is a 13 year old.\u00a0\u00a0She also has type 1 Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0We check her sugar every night to make sure she doesn't go high or low.\u00a0\u00a0The last few nights we have gotten her up and after we check her sugar, which is fine, she begins to twitch in her hands and arms for 10 to 20 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0Then it goes away.\u00a0\u00a0This happened about six months ago but she had had a sugar low.\u00a0\u00a0Tests were done on her head and no problems were found.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor believed that this was muscle spasms and not seizures .\u00a0\u00a0It seems on the first two occasions\u00a0\u00a0my daughter was tired.\u00a0\u00a0 The first two times this happened was after Christmas and New Years(she stayed up late).\u00a0\u00a0But were concerned with the last week happening twice and her not being very active.\u00a0\u00a0Last night she feel asleep with her laptop at 10pm.\u00a0\u00a0She normally goes to bed at this time.\u00a0\u00a0When we woke her to go to bed her speech didn't make sense.\u00a0\u00a0She got up and went upstairs then her legs and arms began to twitch.\u00a0\u00a0When she dropped her shoes we knew someting was odd.\u00a0\u00a0When this happened 6 months ago, her sugar was low, but this week her number has been fine.\u00a0\u00a0We got her in bed and she understood what was going on.\u00a0\u00a0I did sense that her eyes were not right last night before bed though. After 10 to 15 minutes, and me rubbing her neck her arms stopped twitching.\u00a0\u00a0Her leg twitches went away as she laid down.\u00a0\u00a0She has no fever but does have allergy issues.\u00a0\u00a0She does complain about swollen glands which I took her to the doctor last week.\u00a0\u00a0He felt that all she needed was Allegra which she finally took today.\u00a0\u00a0She is at the age where it's hard dealing with the issue of diabetes but she is independent with her pump and can do it all on her own(which I am proud). She does a wonderful job with her diabetes and exercises even when not playing sports.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm not sure if its dehydration, potassium issues, muscle spasm, etc.\u00a0\u00a0It's just tough seeing your child in this situtaion.",
