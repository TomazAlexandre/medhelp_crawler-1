            "answer": "I have this too. Its a form of anxiety. Although very annoying it cant be cured only controlled. If there is no bumps or rash then thats what is causing it. If you have any allergies to dust that could be a reason as well. Next time it happens try taking a warm not hot shower. Otherwise I would talk to your doctor about referring you to a psychiatrist they were really helpful to me and now I barely have the itch and when i do it is only mild and usually only in one spot",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Dry skin is the commonest cause of generalized itching. Applying a moisturizer and using only soaps that are gentle on the skin is helpful in this case. Hypothyroidism too causes dry skin. Please get your thyroid function checked. It could also be due to overuse of AC and heaters.\u00a0\u00a0If you have blisters at tip of fingers and dry skin then you need to rule out certain conditions such as diabetes, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and malnutrition.Generalized itching can be due to allergy. Common allergens are pollen, mold, dust, pet dander, synthetic fiber, food, cosmetics (powders, soaps, shampoos\u2014see if anything was recently changed) or drugs. Food allergies like to gluten, lactose, sea food, and alcohol etc too should be looked into.\u00a0\u00a0It could also be due to new soap, talcum powder, clothes etc. You must get an allergy test done, either a skin test or RAST, to know what you are allergic to. Fungal infections like tinea corporis and tinea cruris too cause whole body itching along with genital itching. Liver problems too can cause generalized itching.If the itch is only in the exposed part, it can also be due to sun allergy. Pubic and body lice can be another cause. Worms are another cause of both anal and body itch and hence get a stool test.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
