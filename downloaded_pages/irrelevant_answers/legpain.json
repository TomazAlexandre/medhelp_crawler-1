            "answer": "HiI presume by saying \u2018icewater feeling\u2019, you mean that your feet are absolutely numb and maybe cold. Numbness is caused due to poor circulation of involvement of the nerve supplying the area. Diabetes has to be ruled out first, by simple blood tests done fasting and 2hrs after food. Nerve involvement is generally at the level of your lower spine, due to causes like spondylosis, swellings, tumors, nerve entrapment etc.Hypothyroidism too causes cold feet and so does smoking. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency too causes this problem.You will need to see your neurologist and physician and run tests like X-ray of spine, blood tests to rule out diabetes, hypothyroidism, CT scan or MRI.Hope this helps. If you need more help, please feel free to contact. I\u2019ll be happy to answer your queries. Please keep me posted.",
