My Dr is pretty much the same, her PA was much more thorough about my measurements and all that when my Dr hadn't even told me I've been measuring ahead. I've only had one ultrasound, unless they have concern they won't do much more.",

            "answer": "I think that is pretty normal. My doctor checked for much more during my first pregnancy, but that's because I had hyperemesis. This pregnancy has been more normal so we've just had the minimum done. As always, though, if you're concerned ask them during your visit or call and talk to the nurse.",

(Which I didn't for my first child.) Gd test at 28 weeks. My next appointment is my 31 week one, I'm sure she is going to measure my uterus (belly) too. It's been the same routine as last time.If you are really concerned talk to your doctor. :)",

            "answer": "I'm considered high risk due to past gastric bypass surgery as well as my age (38) the doctor monitors through these 2 methods as well as every 4 week ultrasound to check babies size. I would gently inquire why it is not being followed closely as babies of moms with GD are typically large and you need to know if they will induce you earlier due to size of baby. Don't hesitate to ask your questions.",

            "answer": "My doc Is the Same way. Every time I go in Is The Same routine, check my weight, pee in a cup, wait in The room and He comes in and does heart beat and checks measurement of belly Then asks Is The baby active Or Is there any change with her behavior, and If I'd been in The hospital For any reason since last visit. I'm 34 weeks tomorrow So at my last appointment I asked him to check my cervix and He did and said All Is normal still Then I asked If I should be getting another ultrasound and He ordered For one So I go in Monday For It. Idk If They have Some special way of Just knowing What needs to be known But I was paranoid about baby's position and The possibility of her umbilical cord being wrapped around her neck So That's Why I asked For an ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0I guess If u ask They will be willing to do more But as long as They see No problems with The pregnancy They Just keep It routine. Talk to him about your concerns and If He still seems to not do things thoroughly Then It's clearly an issue and Maybe u can switch to a new one But If he helps Then That's good and You should Just have faith That He knows what He's doing",

I guess it causes more concerns than necessary at\u00a0\u00a0this point in pregnancy. My uterus was measuring a week ahead at the last appt also. Idk I guess just ask him again my next appt this week",

How do I know what position she's in or how big she is, I do have gestaional\u00a0\u00a0diabetes also, so shouldn't he be checking more than just those two things? I've only had the two ultrasounds one at 9 wks the other at 19 wks. I didn't find out I had gd until wk 29.\u00a0\u00a0My niece just ended up having\u00a0\u00a0her baby 4 weeks early because he (ame doctor) wasn't checking on her either",
