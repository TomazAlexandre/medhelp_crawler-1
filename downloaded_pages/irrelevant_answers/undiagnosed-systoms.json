            "answer": "Lightheadedness, juxtaposed with a compensatory high blood pressure, and trembling, is strongly suggestive of both dehydration and either anemia, or a low hematocrit. So square one is to get blood work. The blood pressure reading is not helpful without knowing the heart rate and rhythym.\u00a0\u00a0Rather than getting a simple blood sugar you need a test called an hba1c. In the United States, the hba1c test kits can be purchased in a drug store, as well as on the internet. You really need an in-person evaluation by a physician.",
