            "answer": "A thyroid panel should include TSH, free T3, free T4 and thyroid antibodies - TPOAb (thyroid peroxidase antibodies) and TgAb (thyroglobulin antibodies). A single TSH test can be \"normal' with hypothyroidism. This is why millions are misdiagnosed.Also, magnesium deficiency is easily misdiagnosed as only 1% of magnesium is in the blood. A better test is RBC (red blood cell) magnesium but again your results can be normal with a deficiency. Magnesium balances blood sugar and a deficiency is strongly linked to insulin resistance, pre diabetes and diabetes.",
