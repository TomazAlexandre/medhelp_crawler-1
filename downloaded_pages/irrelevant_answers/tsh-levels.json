            "answer": "It would be much more useful to have test results for the actual, biologically active thyroid hormones, which are FT3 and FT4.\u00a0\u00a0These tests are not to be confused with total T3 and total T4.\u00a0\u00a0Free T3 is actually the most important, because it is four times as potent as FT4 , and it correlates best with hypo symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0TSH does not correlate with hypo symptoms very well at all.\u00a0\u00a0So I suggest that you pursue getting blood tests for FT3 and FT4 as your first priority, then you can see if low levels of these hormones account for your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you get a copy of the lab report, and post results and reference ranges so that our many experienced members can provide the bet response.In the interim, I think you will\u00a0\u00a0find this link to be very worthwhile reading for you.http://www.hormonerestoration.com/Thyroid.html",

            "answer": "Low TSH can be a symptom of problems other than hyperthyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0That is why I suggested getting the \"Frees\" tested, as a diagnostic help.\u00a0\u00a0Also, going to just any endocrinologist does not guarantee expertise in thyroid problems.\u00a0\u00a0Many specialize in diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I would get the blood testing done and discuss options with the doctor, and with members here, then you can determine the need for a good thyroid doctor.",
