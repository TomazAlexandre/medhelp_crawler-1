    "question": "HelloI have a 10 year old son who has always been the one to get all the weird stuff and I really am looking to find some opinions as my next venture will be finding a doctor out of town.My son was healthy except for eczema pretty bad as an infant at birth but at 4mos developed RSV and was hospitalized and has since had asthma and does have allergy problems.\u00a0\u00a0He went through a year in 2nd grade that he was shakey all of the time and we elimnated diabetes and low blood sugar as both his grandparens (father side) have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor figured it was more nerves than an actual illness so we went on.\u00a0\u00a0He has never been a good sleeper and is my worry about everything child.\u00a0\u00a02 years ago, he was 8, he was sick with a fever and was finally hospitalized after 11 days with a fever.\u00a0\u00a0the doctor treated him for Kawasaki Disease as we were waiting for the results of all the tests with the hemoglobin IV.\u00a0\u00a0He did have every symptom related the teh disease too.\u00a0\u00a0He tested posted for Scarlet Fever and then was given a Penicilan shot and shortly recovered after that.Most recently he developed a staph infection on his leg that lasted for over a month, we dont know how it started but he said he got a cut on his leg and it just got worse.\u00a0\u00a0He is also a very active soccer player that was playing 3-4 times a week so that did include wearing shin guards too.\u00a0\u00a0He was taken off of soccer until it healed.\u00a0\u00a0He was given 3 antibiotics before it started to get better and it never did open up as a soar but it was about a 4 x 4 area of his shin that almost looked like a burn.\u00a0\u00a0The last med Clindamycin was very hard on him and he felt sick a lot but it did work so he had to take that for 14 days.\u00a0\u00a0So now we are currently about 2 months since the infection and it has come back!\u00a0\u00a0The doctor put him on the same medication and we go to see her this afternoon and I am hoping for a culture again.\u00a0\u00a0Now, we do live in a small town and I am will be talking to his doctor this afternoon about going to a specialist but I am just wondering if all these things that are happening to him at age 10 could be something that is triggering these symptoms or illnesses?\u00a0\u00a0I am thinking in the right path?",
