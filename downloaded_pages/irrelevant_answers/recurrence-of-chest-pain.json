    "question": "I 'm 66 and have had Type 2 diabetes for about 2 years, and hypertension for about 6, also raised cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0 My untreated BP was around 180-200/110-120 - so not good!\u00a0\u00a0Back in 2007 I was getting quite a bit of chest pain and was investigated, but with treatment my BP fell to around 115-130/65-80 and I had no problems.\u00a0\u00a0(At this time I was not diagnosed with diabetes. I have had a mild cardiac murmur since childhood, but this is considered insignificant.There is a strong history of hypertension - both parents had it severely, several aunts and cousins were hypertensive and died of heart problems.\u00a0\u00a0My father had several heart attacks from age 60 and died of left ventricular failure.\u00a0\u00a0My mother had congestive cardiac failure.Investigations in 2007ECGTreadmill stress testRadio-isotope stress test - very slight narrowing of LAD, but consideredinsignificantEchocardiogram - mild left ventricular hypertrophy, presumably from BPOver the past couple of years my BP has been rising, with my diastolic consistently above 85, and I was surprised that my GP only made one change to my medication.\u00a0\u00a0This last couple of weeks the chest pain on exertion or stress has returned, sometimes radiating to my neck.\u00a0\u00a0Yesterday my BP was 145/95 and I asked if I could add propranolol - also for my essential tremor.I should like my BP to be below 130/80 as I have diabetes and a the above\u00a0\u00a0family history of heart disease.My cholesterol is slightly raised at around 5.5.\u00a0\u00a0I had to come off simvastatin because of muscle pain, and was changed to bezofibrate 400mg daily.\u00a0\u00a0I've not had a cholesterol reading since then.My blood glucose and HbA1c have been good.Current main medication:Adizem XL 120mg daily (diltiazem)Lisinopril 20mg dailyPropranolol 40mg twice daily (added yesterday)Bezafibrate 400mg dailyMetformin 500mg twice dailyIsosorbide mononitrate 10mg daily, increasing to twice daily (from 5 days)GTN spray as requiredMy GP was unsure whether to refer me again today, but we agreed to see how things go with the added medication and review in a month, or earlier if there is no improvement.Does this seem reasonable?",
