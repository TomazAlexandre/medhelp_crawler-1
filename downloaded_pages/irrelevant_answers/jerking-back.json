            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Though it may sound strange to you, it can be an extension of the restless leg syndrome. Please consult the sleep specialist who diagnosed restless leg for you. Other than that get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. This could also be due to peripheral neuropathies like diabetes or due to pinched lumbar nerve.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
