            "answer": "TSH determines if you are thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0A TSH of 1.44 is good.People with no thyroid conditions can have antibodies as well as other health conditions.\u00a0\u00a0Antibodies are not curable or treatable - nothing can be done about them. Antibodies can wax and wane making people think their antibodies are cured, but no doubt they will pop up again to attack the thyroid.Your symptoms could be from something else going on with for they are not exclusive to thyroid.Thyroid is not determined or treated by symptoms nor antibodies alone.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the reply GravesLady.I was hoping to hear from the Doc as to what this might be. I guess it must not be anything since I haven't heard yet. He told me when the first set of results came in that he was looking for Lupus/mixedconnective tissue disease. I saw that I had the antibodies for thyroid and with all my symptoms, I assumed it was a thyroid issue.I guess I was wrong.",

            "answer": "There are studies that suggest taking about 200mcg of Selenium per day can bring thyroid antibodies down (sometimes completely).\u00a0\u00a0You can google it for more information.\u00a0\u00a0Also, Mary Shomon discusses (and recommends) it in her book 'Living Well with Hypothyroidism'.I know it's not a cure-all, but it's cheap and can't hurt.",

The results were: ANA:1:640 ant my TSH: was 1.44So he ordered more blood work: Thyroglobul AB: 20.8 and Thyroid Pero AB: 17.6DNA DS AB: <1:10, Anti RNP: <1.00Does this indicate a thyroid problem? I am in a managed health care system, so I am waiting for this Doc to get back to me.Thanks for your help",
