            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Dry mouth could be the side effect of the medication you are taking. It could be due to Sjogren\u2019s Syndrome but this will also cause dry eyes.GERD or reflux disease too can cause similar symptoms. A generalized dehydration too can cause these problems.Iron and vitamin deficiency, fungal infection, hypertension, diabetes, strokes and transient ischemic attacks, anemia, smoking all cause dry mouth. Poor oral hygiene is another cause. Nerve damage due to some trauma or surgery can be another cause.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
