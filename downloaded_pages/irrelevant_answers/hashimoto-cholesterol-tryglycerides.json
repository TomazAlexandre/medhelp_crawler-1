            "answer": "Doubt thyroid is causing high trigs now that TSH is treated with armour --- may have contributed initially but there must be another cause -- Would look into insulin resistance, esp with the fatty liver -- also called metabolic syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0Low calorie diet with low sugar/starches may help & regular exercise to avoid further weight gain and keep weight off --\u00a0\u00a0my guess is that it accumulated predominantly in the mid-section.\u00a0\u00a0A 2h glucose tolerance test would also screen for early pre-diabetes.",

            "answer": "Just wondering what your TSH is now at, and your Free T-3 and T-4 levels, as not all doctors have the same treatment guidelines, and UNDERtreated hypo can affect cholesterol levels, etc.Like you, I eat a careful diet but still have issues with cholesterol (tho not triglycerides).Oddly, coconut oil has helped me keep my bad cholesterol numbers down.\u00a0\u00a0This is surprising as theoretically it is a saturated fat, altho different than animal fat -- I'm told it is similar to the fats in a human mother's milk.You might want to look into this -- warning: there is coconut oil and there is coconut oil.You might check a health food store to see what they have, and if they have information on which to use.I gave in to taking 10 mg of Lipitor twice a week -- and did take more until my TSH came down.\u00a0\u00a0Was once off the Lipitor, but think that age, etc. plays a role as well. Right now am adding more fiber to my diet hoping that will help.",

            "answer": "Just wanted to put in my two cents about diet sodas.\u00a0\u00a0We have done quite a bit of research on artificial sweeteners and one of the worst is Aspertame which is in most of the diet drinks and all of the chewing gum. This is bad stuff.\u00a0\u00a0It is one of those things that you never know when you have gone over that level that it will give you a problem.\u00a0\u00a0Just like smoking if everybody got lung cancer the cigarettes would have been outlawed a long time ago.\u00a0\u00a0We are now living in an age of chemicals in our food and our homes.\u00a0\u00a0You need to be well informed.",
