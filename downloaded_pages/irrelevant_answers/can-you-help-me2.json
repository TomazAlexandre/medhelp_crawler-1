            "answer": "I'm unclear what your question is. Are you wanting to know why you're spotting, and/or having such long bleeding? If so, it could be because you just gave birth recently and your body is still adjusting, or it could be from you getting off of birth control. It's also possible to be a combination of the two. It can take up to a year for your body to regulate itself after the birth of a child. Are you on any new type of birth control?I don't understand about the test he did and the numbers, so I can't say anything about that.",

            "answer": "Its mostly likely because you just gave birth not too long ago and you were on hormonal birth control and then stopped taking it. Birth control can really mess up your cycle. If you are wondering about being pregnant it would be highly doubtful that you are.",
