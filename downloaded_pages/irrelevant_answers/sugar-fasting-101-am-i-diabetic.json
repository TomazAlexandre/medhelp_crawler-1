            "answer": "Postprandial rises are usually contributed to the foods you eat. Avoid foods made with white flour - breads, crackers - overcooked pasta, white rice, and potatoes as these quickly get digested. The quicker a food is digested the quicker their sugars enter your bloodstream. Doesn't mean you cannot eat these foods just pay careful attention to portion sizes. Also, lowering your carbohydrate intake helps a lot too.",

            "answer": "Hi there,You've got 2\u00a0\u00a0fasting readings of 98 and 101 which indicates that you are a pre-diabetic. I hope that I am wrong.You are 29, I guess you consume soda drinks quite often. Correct me if I am wrong.To know for sure if you are a pre-diabetic or not, then go buy a self-test kit for diabetes called A1C Now, made by Bayer, available at Wal-mart or Walgreens, for about $25 dollars. This kit is VERY acurate. Follow instructions, then within 5 minutes, you'll see the results.If you wanna see a Doctor for Diabetes diagnosis, to me, go see an Endo only.Common or Family\u00a0\u00a0Doctors knows next to nothing about diabetes.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Buddy - Be sure to include some sort of 30-60 minute daily exercise, like walking for example. Exercise helps to:\u2022 Burn off excess fat\u2022 Improve insulin production which helps lower glucose levels\u2022 Lower blood pressure\u2022 Improve overall healthWhen exercising the body requires fuel/energy. It gets this from your muscles and liver. Walking briskly like you're late to catching your airplane flight makes the muscles and liver release stored glucose, in turn you burn this off. Continued exercise cause the muscles to store excess glucose for future use. This lowers your glucose levels.At this stage you already know you are prediabetic. There is no need for an A1c meter. This where the home glucose meter becomes a useful tool. I'm not certain of the health protocols in India regarding home glucose meter purchases. In the States they run around $10-15 American and can be found at most all drug/pharmacy stores. If you are uncertain call your doctor and ask him/her. Test first thing in morning [fasting] then 2-3 hours after a meal [postprandial]. The latter tells you how the foods you consumed affected your glucose levels. Avoid/restrict those that do. Instead of waiting a week to find out if what you did works you can do this multiple times a day.\u00a0\u00a0HTH",
