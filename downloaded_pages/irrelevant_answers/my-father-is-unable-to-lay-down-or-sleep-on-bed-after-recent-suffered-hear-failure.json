            "answer": "Hello,I'm sorry to hear your father has heart failure.This is a serious condition, and a doctor, preferrably a cardiologist, should answer you. There are no doctors on this forum, I can recommend the \"Heart Disease Expert Forum\", and you will get an answer from an experienced cardiologist.As far as I know, treatment of heart failure depends on what caused it. If he got heart failure secondary to a heart attack, treatment (as getting it cured) is difficult, because the heart muscle is damaged. Treatment would be 1) Digitalis (to strengthen the remaining part of the heart), 2) Beta blockers to prevent arrhythmias, and 3) An exercise program to strengthen the remaining part of the heart. In addition, diuretics are used to reduce water in the body.If the heart failure is not caused by \"physical\" damage to the heart, but conditions as tachycardia, hyper/hypothyreoids or blood pressure issues, the first treatment is to treat the underlying disease. The heart capacity will often improve afterwards.High blood pressure and diabetes is extremely important to get controlled in the setting of heart failure.An LV EF of 25% is low (heart capacity is more than 50% reduced). I would advice your father to stay in close contact with his doctor / cardiologist.Best wishes to you both.",

            "answer": "Hi i read your post too...you may want to try to get your father to try to sleep in a fairly up right position at nite..like putting two or three pillows behind his back so that he is sleeping in a postion that would allow blood flow and oxygen levels as that is the normal position that he is in during the daytime and from what you have written his issues seem to be happening at nite.\u00a0\u00a0You will lose nothing by trying it ...it may simply be a situation of posturing and it would make sense to me......good luck to you both",
