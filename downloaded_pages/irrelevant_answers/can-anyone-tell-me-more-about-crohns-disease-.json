            "answer": "Hi - bit difficult to know where to start with your questions - I could write a book about Crohn's Disease! Is your interest academic for a thesis, as a patient or care-giver?Basically, it is an auto-immune disease, where one makes too many white cells which attack the intestines. It is not infectious nor contagious. Current medical scientists do not know why one gets it, there are probably genetic considerations, and its' incidence is elevated in the Jewish Ashkenazi population from Eastern Europe.\u00a0\u00a0It can manifest in children as young as 6 yrs old, but the prevalence is in young people from 18-30 yrs old.\u00a0\u00a0It is currently not considered curable, but eminently treatable, either by surgical intervention or medication. It is not life threatening, except in rare circumstances, such as strictures.\u00a0\u00a0 Treatments vary with the diagnosis, as it can appear from mouth to anus, and rarely, in the eyes. There are many different medications like steroids, immuno-suppressants etc. and sometimes surgery is called for is there are strictures in the intestines. As far as I am aware, the only conclusive diagnosis is from colonoscopy of the large intestine, or endoscopy of the small intestine, with biopsies of tissue taken from abnormal looking areas, which are looked at by a pathologist.Symptoms also vary, from severe diarrhea, weight loss and pain in the lower abdomen and rarely, constipation.\u00a0\u00a0 It should not be confused with ulcerative colitis, as this only affects the outer mucosa of the large intestine, whereas Crohn's affects the whole of the intestinal lining of the small intestine and sometimes the large colon.For a lengthier overview, google \"Crohns Disease\" where there is a lot of good peer reviewed information on current treatments. I would emphasise that no doctor or scientist I have come across knows why it occurs.\u00a0\u00a0Bit like diabetes or asthma I guess.I have had intractable Crohn's for 38 yrs, had many different medications, many hospital in-patient treatments, but still alive and smelling the roses.Let me know if I can help further.Take care,Liz.",
