            "answer": "Hi!If the GFR is low then you need to keep good check on protein and fluid intake. Please do not drink any thing without asking your doctor. You need to be under a nephrologist and a dietician. Salt intake too will have to be restricted.\u00a0\u00a0It is almost impossible to get near normal GFR levels. However with diet control and keeping a good control on diabetes and hypertension, you can slow down further progression and lead a normal life. Please discuss with your treating doctor. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
