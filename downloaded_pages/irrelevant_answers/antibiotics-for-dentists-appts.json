            "answer": "Copied from the Mayo clinicAn American Heart Association (AHA) committee found that for most people, the risk of endocarditis from dental procedures was low. Daily activities, such as brushing, flossing or chewing, are much more likely to cause endocarditis than are bacteria that enter the bloodstream from a single dental procedure.\"Preventive antibiotics before dental work are now recommended only for people who, if they develop endocarditis, are more likely to die or have serious complications,\" says Walter Wilson, M.D., an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic. Dr. Wilson headed the AHA committee that recently revised the guidelines.The new recommendations suggest preventive antibiotics before dental work only for those people with artificial heart valves, a history of infective endocarditis, certain forms of congenital heart disease and cardiac valve abnormalities following a heart transplant.Preventive antibiotics are no longer recommended for many people who have common heart conditions such as mitral valve prolapse or rheumatic heart disease. Before their next dental visit, patients who have taken preventive antibiotics should check with a doctor or dentist to discuss the guideline changes and determine if the medication is necessary",

Thank you both for the info -- it helped me calm down and look at the facts.",

    "question": "I have been told after taking antiobiotics for many years before dental work, that the current theory is they are not needed, even though I have a mild mitral regurge.\u00a0\u00a0I also am on coumadin and antibiotics apparently interacts with that drug.\u00a0\u00a0I need my teeth cleaned very badly -- I have put it off because I've not felt up to it, and I know it is important for heart health to take care of my teeth.\u00a0\u00a0To further complicate matters, I am diabetic and I wonder what would happen if I did develop an infection.\u00a0\u00a0Would I have to go off the Coumadin to be treated for it?\u00a0\u00a0I can and will call the doctor regarding this, but it will be a week or so before I get answers.\u00a0\u00a0Just wondering if anyone has experience with this.\u00a0\u00a0I cancelled an appt. today because I was scared to go.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone can shed some light on this, I'd appreciate it.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
