            "answer": "Hello,Such pain and tingling could be arising from neuropathies secondary to diabetes, nerve entrapment at the thoracic outlet, cervical spondylitis, vitamin deficiency, menopause, endocrinological causes,\u00a0\u00a0and lastly vascular obstructions. The symptoms can be reverted back once the cause has been ascertained. You may consult a primary care general physician for an examination.If there is lesion of any serious nature your physician would then refer to the concerned specialist based on the findings. In the meantime its advisable to use a proper sized pillow for neck support while sleeping, avoid lifting heavy weights, include diets rich in calcium, vitamins to daily routine, mild exercises of the shoulder and neck if there is no pain.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
