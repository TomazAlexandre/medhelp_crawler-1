            "answer": "Usually we recommend conservative therapy for 6-8 weeks and if there's no improvement or worsening of symptoms, then surgery becomes the next step. However, many variables are taken into consideration as to when or if the surgery should be performed such as the patient's age, current medical problems that may make the surgery or recovery period more complicated such as severe lung disease or diabetes, and severity of the back/neck problem. If the symptoms are significantly affecting your daily life and things just aren't getting any better with conservative therapy, then consider getting a second opinion from a spine specialist. With long term compression, there can be permanent damage to the nerves.As for Vax-D, it has shown to be of some benefit in 2 relatively recent studies with 60-70% patients undergoing multiple treatments (about 10 or more) reporting an improvement in symptoms. However, if there is significant nerve damage or signs of serious nerve compression, neurological deterioration or deficits, then more aggressive therapy may be warranted. This needs to be discussed with your neurosurgeon. Again, consider going for a second opinion at a major academic hospital with spine specialists, especially if you have a complicated case.Good luck.",
