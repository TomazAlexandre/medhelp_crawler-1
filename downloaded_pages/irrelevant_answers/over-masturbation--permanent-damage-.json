This is because the conscious mind can only focus on one subject at a time. You are either worrying, or applying yourself to fulfilling your partner emotionally as well as sexually during sex.Over masturbating doesn't cause premature ejaculation or impotency. Make sure you are drinking plenty of filtered water - 2 glasses every two hours, as you may be dehydrated.",
