He is on no medication, just cut the sugar completely. These numbers have been consistently for 3 days. He just to see what would happy ate french toast with syrup yesterday morning with eggs and biscuits; 98 1 hour after. I think they made a mistake. We decided to continue following the no-sugar, low-carb diet just in case and keep checking and do another A1C in 2 months",

(that is his faze 1 insulin response)Test first thing in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0this will tell you if he had DP (dawn Phenomena)when a person becomes diabetic the fasting BG is the last to go bad.Try one time, after his biggest meal testing every 30 minutes for 2 hours. that will give you a good profile of his response to food.",

    "question": "My husband is 65 and normal weight and very physically active. He was recently told he was prediabetic with a HbA1C of 5.9. He was hypoglycemic in his 30s. He has a very strong family History of diabetes; father lost both legs. Most diets are directed toward losing weight, but he does not have an ounce to lose. would just cutting out all sugar and eating a low-carb diet be enough to reverse this or is his genes just going to lead to problems. He already uses an elliptical or treadmill 30 minutes and a total gym workout 3-4 x per week. He has normal triglycerides and cholesterol is 129 and no blood pressure problems. Is there anything we can do or is he just going to convert over.",
