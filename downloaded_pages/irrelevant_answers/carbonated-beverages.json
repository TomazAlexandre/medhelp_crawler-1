            "answer": "Soda without caffeine only has one danger: sugar content. During pregnancy you need to keep an eye on (not necessarily limit) sugar consumption because it can affect Gestational Diabetes which you will be tested for later.Caffeine should be limited to less than 300mg a day...which is anywhere from 5-7 sodas a day, depending on the soda (caffeine content should be listed on the can or can be found online) and approximately 2-3 cups of coffee. I would personally try to stick to 2-3 caffeinated sodas at the most, that's the max I drank during both pregnancies.",
