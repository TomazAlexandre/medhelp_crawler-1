    "question": "My thyroid levels have been too low for a long time because I can't find a decent doctor. The last several months I have a new symptom, my throat is constantly dry, as are my nose and eyes. I drink water all the time, but my throat is still very dry and I feel like I could pass out, like I'm severely dehydrated. My mouth isn't dry though, that has plenty of saliva. Is this all thyroid related. I've been hypothyroid with Hashi's and undertreated for over a year.I don't have diabetes. I've been tested. I am hypoglycemic though.",
