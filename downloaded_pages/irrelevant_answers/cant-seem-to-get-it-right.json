            "answer": "Your doctor probably is right.\u00a0\u00a0And you might have to treat each symptom separately from each other and form thyroid, where possible, if you want any kind of relief.Your doctor has her reasons and she knows your health better than anyone.\u00a0\u00a0Such as:\"Armour Thyroid tablets should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease and it may increase the symptoms of diabetes, mellitus, diabetes inspidus or adrenal insufficiency\".\u00a0\u00a0From the Armour Official Web Stie\"Thyroid extract (Armour Thyroid) is generally not recommended due to variation in potency and contains large amounts of T3 which can cause palpitations and tremors.\" From Thyroid Foundation\"Physicians also are concerned that a tablet of T3 causes higher than normal blood levels of this hormone, posing a risk for dangerous cardiac arythmias and heart attacks...\" From\u00a0\u00a0Thyroid-Fed.org, The New England Journal Of Medicine.\"overall there was little to no evidence that a combinationof T3 added to thyroxine provided therapeutic benefitadditional randomized control trials of L-thyroxine alone vs. thyroxineplus T3 did not show any clinical benefit of T3 supplementationTreatment of hypothyroidism with excess T3 has potential risks and ...\"From MyThyroidThe reason why there can be problems using Armour or cytomel (T3)\u00a0\u00a0has to do with the life span and action of this particular chemical. It has a very short biological life compared to T4, and is also the form of thyroid hormone immediately used by cells. The T4 is continuously converted into T3 in the body as the body needs it. When you swallow a pill with T3 in it (whether it is Armour or cytomel) you are providing a spike of hormone that will be immediately used in cell metabolic functions. It could be that your body does not need the T3 at that point in time, but it gets it anyway. It is difficult, then, to provide enough of a constant of the hormoen, in the background, to avoid ups and downs. In someone with a wonky heart, these ups and downs and create problems.None of the med. options are a 100% guarantee cure-all for symptom nor are they miracle treatments.In case you didn't know, some people develop TED when they take animal-based extracts such as Armour, because the immune system\u00a0\u00a0react to foreign proteins found in glandular extracts. Synthetic meds. doesn't cause this probelm.You can hunt for a doctor who will\u00a0\u00a0prescribe\u00a0\u00a0Armour/Cytomel, I am sure they are out there, but don't expect miracles.Good luck",

            "answer": "Thanks for the info. You have given me alot to think about. I am starting to realize that I just might never feel good again. This is a hard thing to come to terms with. I need to just take one day at a time and maybe try changing my diet.",

            "answer": "Will, I am hoping that some day you will feel good again.\u00a0\u00a0These symptom might eventually surpass as you body heals.\u00a0\u00a0Granted this could take time but hopefully you will reach that point.Mean while we can help ourselves by trying to treat each symptom separate and separate from Thyroid, such as antidepressants/anxiety meds., sleep aids, etc . As well as through good nutrition and diet, vitamin/mineral supplements, exercise, plenty of rest and sleep, keep mental/physical stress down, get rid of any bad habits, etc.Think positive/think positive thoughts, meditation, yoga (there is a yoga exercise position that is good for the thyroid), laugh (watch funny movies/sit coms vs.. sad, laughter is the best medicine). Anyway, I am sure you get the idea.I wish you a happy, health, symptom free life.",

            "answer": "I don't know about your issue but agree with GL. If you are out of options, do try yoga. If you don't want to go to a class, there are lots of beginner yoga dvds. It's a good workout and is a really good stress reliever. Focusing on poses gives your mind something different to think about. I love it.",

    "question": "I have been txing with my doctors for almost 2 years for Hypo/Hashi. He sent me to see an endocrinologist. She increased my synthroid from 75mcg to 88mcg. My TSH levels are normal now but I still feel tired, muscle and joint pain, brain fog, hair loss, weight gain (43lbs), headaches, cronic sinus infections and puffy face and neck on the left side. I have been tested for so many other conditions but todate, all other test come back normal. I have done alot of reading on this subject and found that some people respond to Armour or even using synthroid with cytomel. They say the combination of T3 and T4 seem to make the symptoms go away. I questioned my endocrinologist about this and was told that she would not use cytomel because it causes rapid heart beats. She then stated that according to her last seminar, this is as good as I would ever feel and I would need to learn to live with it. She would not answer my questions. I stood up and walked over to her to show her the book I was reading. She told me to sit down or she would not answer and additional questions. I feel I should be able to ask as many questions as I can. This is my health and if I do not look out for it, who will? I would really like to try Cytomel, but I know she will not write an RX for it. I am not due for a recheck for another 6 months. I need to find something that will give my some releife of my symptoms. I am 36 years old and I feel like I am 80 years old. I can not even imagine living the rest of my like feeling like this. Any suggestions.",
