    "question": "I have been feeling unwell for a while. My first round of blood tests showed I was slightly anemic and b12 deficient. I started taking b12 supplements, and felt better for a couple days, and then got worse. My body temperature is much lower than normal (between 94.1 and 95.6 instead of my normal 97ish), I get dizzy and light headed often, my heart often races when I stand up, my legs hurt like crazy, and I often get shaky. Unfortunately my doctor says they are just panic attacks, but I really don't think they are. Can you recommend anything to test for?",
