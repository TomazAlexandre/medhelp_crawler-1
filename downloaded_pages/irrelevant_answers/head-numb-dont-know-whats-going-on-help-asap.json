    "question": "-HEAD NUMBNESS-OKay lets start with the backround.- About 4 months ago I had what I beleive to be a mini stroke, had all the symptoms, every single one and only other time it happend was a year prior to that episode so im pretty sure thats what it was.- For about two weeks after that everything was fine exept for my hands suddenly and very severly going numb, but I do have a history carple tunnle so I chalked it up to that creeping up on me again.-After that my temple on the right side would get a shocky/tingly type feel along with pressure and would go numb, ocasionaly making side of face go numb along with it. (this occured for a good solid month or so)----Then it started switching sides on and off.-After that my head started getting ALOT of pressure daily, and well needless to say my head goes numb at least 3-4 times a day. Can last for hours... And allways has some sort of pain.----------A little more info:I have a feeling of \"swelling in the upper back of my neck.I get burning sensations on my face ocasionally and also burning sensations in my head.I get a feeling of something leaking inside my head it feels slightly cold, this has been going on LONG before these symptoms started tho. but now its all in different places about 3 to be exact.My head feels like its going to explode alot.And overall my head feels just weird.~~~~~~ Please note that im 17 years old and 38 weeks pregnant symptoms have been non-stop for about 4 months now. Sometimes I think its a tumor other times something being compressed in my neck restricting proper blood flow to the head.I caint even do school work or anything with feeling this way and im sure I will soon be kicked out bcuz of it.I do get some relief with a fluffy neck pillow on the back top of my head while laying down flat, if i put it under my neck it makes it worse.Medical conditions: I came up high on a glucose screening at my prenatal visit but never did the 3 hour evaluation so I dont know if I have gestational diabetes or not but lets just take it as I do..I have anxiety, and moments where i just freak out for no known reason. Other then that I dont have anything KNOWN thats to seriousIf anyone has these symtoms please let me know especially if they know what it is, hopefully i'll get to the e.r and they will do an MRI Im scared!.",
