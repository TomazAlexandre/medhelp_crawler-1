            "answer": "Hello,The most common cause of oily urine is ketones in urine. These appear in individuals with uncontrolled diabetes and also during periods of starvation or a stringent dietary regimen. The other possibility is of Chyle that is produced by your lymph nodes is the reason for the urine's oily residue. This is more noticeable if you left the urine stand for a period of time.Urine analysis may be done to help with the diagnosis.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "I have noticed the same thin shinny film on the toilet water surface after i urinate, and also noticed the film seems to be trying to harden almost like cake frosting, and breaks with the crack opening on the water surface when anything is dropped in the water, and stiff ripples appear near the edges of the crack in the film, taking a split second to flatten out again. this cause me to wonder if sugar or a metal like magnesium or calcium might be involved? I'm 65 and I've never had diabetes as far as i know, but i do know i rarely drink enough water.\u00a0\u00a0I wonder if there's any way short of spector analysis of the toilet water to determine what this is. I know it doesnt appear to be normal, and assume it could be a good way of detecting a problem in the kidneys, if only someone could say what it is most likely to be in the urine making the shiny film. one thing i know is i used a fleet that contained mineral oil a week or so ago, and wonder if\u00a0\u00a0mineral oil could actually make it into the urine unchanged, making an actual oil film, but the stiffness of the film to me suggests a solid dissolved in the urine.",
