            "answer": "Being diagnosed with diabetes doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you will be on insulin right away unless your doctor decides so. I have been diabetic for the past 14 years and was only reciently put on insulin. I&#39;m using the Lentus Solostar pen method and I use the very smallest needles to deliver the insulin. There are times I actually don&#39;t feel the needle or other wise it&#39;s a very painless prick, really. Do a google search to find out more about this system of insulin delivery. Hope this is helpful.",

            "answer": "Some people with type 2 diabetes will find that eating a ketogenic diet eliminates their need for insulin.However, if you really need insulin to contrl blood sugars then please do not be scared to use it.\u00a0\u00a0Blood sugar control is critical to health.The complications of uncontrolled blood sugar will be far worse than the prick of a very small needle.\u00a0\u00a0The need is actually so small and thin that in many cases it cannot be felt.",
