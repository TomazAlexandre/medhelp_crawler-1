            "answer": "I've had the same problem. In my case the cause is very innocent: the balance of the bacteria present in the vagina is disturbed (this in turn could have all kinds of innocent causes: hormones, diabetes, the pil...). This causes the vagina to itch and sometimes even smell bad. This problem, 'a disturbed balance', is a problem many women have!! But not everyone experiences the downsides (itch, smell).My family doctors all said nothing can be done about this imbalance. My mom has had it for years and years, until she stopped taking the pil! But if it really itches, you should go see a doctor. She/he will give you some vaginal pills (after a simple test). This helps get rid of the itch!!Good luck.",
