    "question": "I am newly diagnosed type 1, and have been put on insulin injections since the 2nd july. Recently I have been getting a pain in my stomach and across my right shoulder blade through the centre of my chest. It seems to come on quite randomly and can last from 15 mins to a few hours. Does anyone know what this might be?\u00a0\u00a0Is it related to the diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0I have so many questions.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for any advice.Michele.",
