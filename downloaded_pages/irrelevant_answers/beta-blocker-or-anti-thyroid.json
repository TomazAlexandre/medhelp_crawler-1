            "answer": "Thanks for your insight.The conflicting levels are what made my 2nd opinion doctor not convinced of Graves, as the 1st doctor believes. I have normal BP and am worried about the betablockers. This is crazy.I was thinking of paying $35 to ask Dr. Richard Guttler (on the internet) for his opinion. Any opinions about that?",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with Graves disease by my endo and prescribed methimazole 10mg daily. However, because I have no symptoms, I sought a second opinion. This doctor said my test rsults weren't conclusive of hyperthyroid and prescribed beta blocker Toprol. I haven't taken either. This is so confusing. I'd like to ask Dr. Lupo his opinon but it seems there are no more questions accepted, as I've logged on daily to post to hom for a month and the \"daily question\" quota is full. Maybe someone here can advise me...Here are my tests:TSH \t<0.01Thyroglobulin AB\t12.2Thyroglobulin\t5.7T3\t178T4 Free\u00a0\u00a0\t1.26, 1.08, 1.02T3 Free\t434T3 Total\t203Thyroperoxidase Antibody\t1256RI Uptake and Thyroid Scan\t6 hr. = 40.3%24 hr. = 51.5%Ultrasound Rt.
