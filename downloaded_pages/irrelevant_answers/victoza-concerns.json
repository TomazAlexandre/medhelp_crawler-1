You postedNon-Diabetic level\u00a0\u00a0<6%Goal for Diabetic Patient\u00a0\u00a07%:Therapeutic action 8%What this equates to is:6% = 126 mg/dl7% = 154.2 mg/dl8% = 182.9 mg/dl [waiting to treat is highly questionable]The goal is <5% [96.8 mg/dl] as 5.1% = 99.67 mg/dl, a tad over max normal. My HMO and several major hospitals I deal with target an A1c of 182.9 mg/dl to treat [therapeutic action] is very unhealthy.Forget what the ADA says is \"normal\". Although the ADA provides very useful information one thing it fails on is glucose levels. Why? It is simple, the ADA web site is sponsored by major drug companies. I call it the wolf watching the sheep pen. Calling higher levels normal makes one depend on more medication, not less. The more you need the more you buy, the more profits drug companies make.",

If you're higher in the morning your liver may be in overtime releasing stored glucose. You might try not eating simple carbs, or lower your carb intake at dinner to see if it helps.",

            "answer": "Hey, the discussion of Victoza got lost here somewhere. Why do you all advocate taking insulin with type II diabetes and an A1C of 6-7?\u00a0\u00a0I have artery disease, as do many diabetics whether they know it or not, and high insulin levels in the blood seems directly related to artery disease. Adding insulin when your insulin levels are NOT too low, or are already high because your body is trying to do something about all the sugar, makes no sense!\u00a0\u00a0I found out I had diabetes when I had a 99% blockage in my LAD artery and had a stent implanted! I am lucky I had symptoms, many just fall over dead. At that time, my A1C was 14!Everyone with diabetes should be having the C-peptide test as part of their routine bloodwork, I always make sure it is done, and I ALWAYS get a copy of my bloodwork for my files. As long as my insulin levels are normal (to high-normal), I most certainly do NOT want to add more insulin into my body!\u00a0\u00a0Having an alternative like Victoza is great!\u00a0\u00a0Beats having a heart attack! I have not been managing my blood sugar well either for the last year (mainly because I have not been working out like I was, due to a new job that has made it difficult) and it has crept back up into the 250-300 range with taking 2000mg metformin. After two weeks of Victoza, my sugars have dropped 150 points, with no exercise. Last night I saw 113 on my meter, a sight not seen in ages!\u00a0\u00a0However, the side affects are really beating me up.\u00a0\u00a0I have had constant nausea, dizziness, a generally flu-like feeling all day, and even a low-grade fever at night! But they tell me this will subside soon, and the 150 points I think is worth it, oh and also the 8 lbs I have lost already. AND not having to take insulin which could be hard on my heart, instead to replace a hormone that is found to be lacking in diabetics...that's a no-brainer for me. I started at .6 and am at\u00a0\u00a0the 1.2 dosage now. My doctor does not plan to raise the dosage higher, he thinks that will be enough, and it seems he will be right. Later perhaps, it may need to be raised, but then there will be room to do it.They say it has caused thyroid cancer in mice and rats, but not yet in humans. Perhaps it is too soon for some to take a chance on this drug, but not for me. I am 50 and so am more concerned about a sudden heart episode, really. My own common sense says that introducing a human hormone into the bodies of mice and rats would cause their hormonal glands to freak out, and perhaps produce cancerous cells. The question is, will these modified human hormones do the same to human hormonal glands? So far they have not, and now I guess I am part of the next long-term experiment. I researched, I educated myself, I looked at my situation, and I decided to try it. My doctor recommended it, but that is all. I am the one who made the decision. We could have added more Metformin, and Actos, and then perhaps resorted finally to insulin, or, we could try this. Time will tell if we made the right decision, but my sugar levels are saying, for now at least, that we made the right one.\u00a0\u00a0What I would like to learn here is if there have been any serious side affects (besides pancreatitis which I already know about) in people since the studies were documented in the med insert.",

I have been experiencing the nausea, vomiting, and just not feeling well in general, but I keep telling myself this will pass. I agree with you that this is such a new medication and that all of the side effects experienced during the FDA trials have to be reported no matter how many people experienced them. I know this because I happen to be a clinical trial nurse coordinator and it is my job to report those side effects.Since starting the victoza I also have seen a drop in my blood sugars. Before that I was on FOUR different medications and still experiencing fasting blood sugars of over 250, you can imagine what an after meal blood sugar would be. I did not want to return to being on injectable insulins again because they caused weight gain and that just compounded my other health issues (I also have rheumatoid arthritis).\u00a0\u00a0As long as I can continue to work and do the thintgs enjoy I know that the side effects of the victoza will eventually go away.\u00a0\u00a0The benefits out weigh the side effects any day!",
