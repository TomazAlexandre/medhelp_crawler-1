            "answer": "Hi Sandi,Its too bad so many doctors don't take the time to explain their reasoning behind such statements as what you heard.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe then there wouldn't be so many patients doubting their health problems.\u00a0\u00a0Your problems could be one of my causes, including diabetes side effects oe lupus, fibro and EB.\u00a0\u00a0All of those can cause symptoms that mimic MS.\u00a0\u00a0Count yourself lucky if it is just diabetes.I am so sorry to hear your sister has MS.\u00a0\u00a0Just don't internalize her problems and try to make them your own, ok?stay in touch if you need us,Lulu",

            "answer": "HI JENSEQUITUR,Yeah, I do have diabetes. Have had it for 4 years now, but my sugar numbers are really good.\u00a0\u00a0For the most part I watch.\u00a0\u00a0I\u00a0\u00a0had a bad fall 2 years ago in a movie theater, and fell backwards.\u00a0\u00a0That's when the additional problems i am having started.\u00a0\u00a0The numbness and tremors.\u00a0\u00a0My chiro doesn't think this is from the diabetes, she said some of my problems are too specific.\u00a0\u00a0my lips get numb, my nose, my neck. and i also have tremors on my left side. neuro said possible parkinsons, and he also said i have Lhimettes sign, which he said is very frequent with people who have ms.\u00a0\u00a0my endocrinologist doesn't think this is from diabetes, cause as i said my glucose numbers are pretty good.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not on insulin only oral meds. My neuro said something is wrong and we definitely have to get to the bottom of it because neurologically I seem to be deteriorating, and we have to find out why.\u00a0\u00a0I just want a diagnosis of something, not a run around.\u00a0\u00a0anyway thanks guys\u00a0\u00a0 sandie",

I EVEN HANDED HIM A LIST OF MY SYMPTOMS, BECAUSE I CAN'T REMEMBER ALL OF THEM, AND HE SAID, TAKE THAT BACK I DON'T NEED TO READ THAT. I THEN WENT TO ANOTHER NEUROLOGIST, HE LOOKED AT THE LESION, AND SAID EVERYBODY GETS THEM, YOURS IS NORMAL. HE SAID ALL OF THE NUMBNESS AND TINGLING IN MY FACE, SCALP, HANDS, LEGS, ARM, FEET ETC IS DIABETIC NEUROPATHY.
