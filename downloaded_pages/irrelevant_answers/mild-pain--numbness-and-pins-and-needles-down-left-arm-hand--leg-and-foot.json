            "answer": "Hello,Numbness and parasthesia on the left side of the body means that there may be an abnormality in the right side of the brain.It can be a neurological pathology like motor neuron disease,TIA or stroke or autoimmune condition like multiple sclerosis in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system (CNS), leading to demyelination.It can be diagnosed by MRI brain and MRS of the brain.Other possibilities are vit B12 deficiency,diabetes(already ruled out in your case) , hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism or peripheral nerve trauma or compression.If tingling is there only on the left half of the body,it means a right side pathology of the brain.So I feel that clinical evaluation from a neurologist is necessary to rule it out.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "I have been having a lot of the same symptoms also on my left side, and am also 43. I had some x-rays done through my GP and they showed \"Minimal Spondylosis\" at L3. I am also to see a neurologist to rule out anything else. I have had numbnes/pins and needles off and on from head to toe on my left side. The other day my left cheek felt numb for about an hour and then it just went away. I haven't had it again since then. Also on occasion the tip of my tongue gets a slight feeling of pins and needles. Most of my numbness and tingling is in the left leg and foot. Sometimes in the left arm and hand. I was hoping my GP would order an MRI instead of the x-ray, but I guess that will be done through the neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0My symptoms started in the left foot and have worked their way up my whole left side. Everyday is different. It can be quite frustrating.",

            "answer": "Hi I am nearly 52, reasonable fit but gaining weight. My family have a history of thyroid problems, and angina. I have had some tingling before on the right side but today all of a sudden I had it develop on the left. It started in my foot (most noticible) and I also had it go down my arm to my hand. It felt really strange in my upper arm and now that it is abating I feel like I have muscle fatigue. My friend who is a nurse had me sit down and rest. I have gained weight recently and do have a multi nodula goitre ( I haven't seen anyone to review this in quite a few years). Any suggestions on which way to go medically - I would be a public patient?",

Also, I have been on the antibiotic Levaquin for a recurring sinus infection, and I take Advil for headaches. Today I was doing something physical when all at once my left hand and forearm went totally numb and I felt a bit woozy. It went away in about an hour and a half, but it scared the **** out of me, and according to my Yahoo searching, these are among the symptoms of a mini-stroke. I'm going to see a doctor in a few days, but I am confused, since even with a family history, I'm two decades away from the risk zone for strokes. Any knowledgeable advice would be appreciated.",

It went away in her leg and foot but stayed in her arm and hand for about 24 hours. The doctors were unable to diagnois her. They told her it could be ms, migraines, or even a mini stroke. She's only 41 and healthy. I was just wondering if anyone had a thought on her condition? She did get a mri which showed 3 spots on her brain but have been there for almost 10 years and was told not to worry about it!
