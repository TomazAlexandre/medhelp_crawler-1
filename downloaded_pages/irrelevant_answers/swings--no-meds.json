            "answer": "I am confused as to why doctor would take her off of synthroid. A patient with hashimotos, should have a supressed TSH of between .50-1.0. ALso she needs to have Free T4 and Free T3 done at the same time....not total T3...test is outdated and not usefule. The Free's show the active hormone.Going off medicine doesn't remove symptoms....being properly medicated and reaching optimum levels does remove symptoms.Are you taking her to a thyroid specialist? Not an endo that specializes in diabetes, but a doctor that specializes and understands hashimoto's.There really is not need to keep running the antibody tests...hashimoto's never goes away. Once the antibodies have killed off the thyroid they will most likely lessen in amount, but they will always remain in the body.Testing every 6 weeks is critical as you are trying to find proper levels....that part the dr is actually correct. :)I think you have a dr who doesnt understand the thyroid....medications...numbers...and hashimoto's very well. You may want to search for a better one.My first suggestion is to start reading as much as you can and educate yourself on hashimoto's and thyroid disease. Get on the internet and start reading everything you can. Good luck!",
