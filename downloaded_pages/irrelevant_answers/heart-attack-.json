            "answer": "If you have no history of depression it seems likely to me there is some physiological reason for the symptoms you describe.\u00a0\u00a0I\u00a0\u00a0would suggest another more proactive step, and that is to go to a diagnostic clinic like Mayo, Cleveland, or a university hospital where you can be evaluated by a team of specialists.\u00a0\u00a0 If you are not making progress in your health, then your doctor treating you now should be very willing to make a referral.\u00a0\u00a0If not, do it on your own.\u00a0\u00a0If you can't get a quick appointment, by all means do see a cardiologist and at least rule out heart issues--the sooner the better.",

            "answer": "If everything is checking out OK then perhaps they could check you for fibromyalgia. That causes extreme fatigue and aches and pains that come and go. There's no blood test or x-ray that shows it. It's a syndrome but by checking the proper points on your body for pain, they may be able to figure this out.",

    "question": "I have had two bouts of becoming overwhelmed by a sense of black doom, breaking out in a cold sweat, feeling like I would throw up, and not being able to think, stand, or function. These two episodes have happened over the past two weeks, and each episode lasted about five minutes. When the feeling passed, I felt much better, but my energy was totally drained. Both episodes happened in the morning, on days that I actually felt good about getting out of bed, for a change.I have gained 33 pounds since Christmas, and the weight gain has been documented at my doctor's office. I have had NO energy, and can easily sleep 16 hours per day if allowed. When I wake, I am still miserably tired and literally count the hours until I can sleep again. I have two active children so it's not like I can sleep all day!I have been taking Lexipro which my doctor thinks may be causing the weight gain. I am being weaned off of it now and he has given my Cymbalta. Please note that I am not hiding under covers trying to escape life - I have a wonderful, full, rich life with many blessings including a loving, supportive husband and two children. I have always been described as bubbly, effervescent, and full of life, and I still am, when I am not physically exhausted.I have also had a constant pain in my left shoulder, deep on the inside, as well as pain in my upper back. Sometimes I have body aches that make me feel like I have the flu. I also have a dull pain in my left jaw and sometimes pain radiating down my neck. My doctor has run several tests including thyroid function, glucose, and some neurological studies. Everything comes back perfect, but I still feel bad.Could this be a heart condition? Should I be more pro-active by seeking out a cardiologist on my own? There is a lot of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease in my family. Am I just being a hypochondriac?",
