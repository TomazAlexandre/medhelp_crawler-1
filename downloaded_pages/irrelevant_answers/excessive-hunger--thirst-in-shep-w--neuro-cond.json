            "answer": "Hi.. 6+ cups for a shepherd sound about right.. I've taken care of skinny sheps that need 7 cups a day..I don't know much about Cerebellar Abiotrophy, but I do know that it is has symptoms similar to Degenerative Myelopathy, an incurable autoimmune disease much like MS to humans. DM is very very common among Shepherds(especially the old German bred lines), and can have effects on the kidneys(I forget what exactly), and produce a high ACTH level, which is what they measure to diagnose cushings.Has he been tested to rule out DM? Why do they think CA over DM? I've never heard of a shepherd with CA, but have taken care of a handful with DM-wobbly back end, balance problems, etc are the main symptoms, and since it effects the kidneys and ACTH levels it may be contributing to his drinking problem.Ask your vet about DM and get his ACTH checked.. If its high It may point to Cushings, but underlying I would suspect DM over CA..Take care",

    "question": "Hi there,I have\u00a0\u00a010mo German Shepherd/poss Husky mix that has an undefined Neurological Condition. It's most likely that it is Cerebellar Abiotrophy but of course there is no way to test for it.My question is that he has excessive hunger and thirst.\u00a0\u00a0He drinks almost a gallon of water each day and eats 6 cups or more of food per day. If he misses lunch, he roots for food. If he can't find it, he'll eat rocks or anything he can find. He has had two blood panels (both within normal ranges) as well as a Liver Enzyme check (also within normal range) and just recently a Urinalysis to rule out Kidney infection and that was also normal. He has had these symptoms since I began fostering him at 10 weeks old.Is it possible that the Neuro condition and the excessive hunger and thirst are related or is there something more/tests, etc I can do for him?Thanks!",
