            "answer": "I sure hope you have been referred to an endocrinologist, one who specializes in thyroid, not diabetes.Your TSH is too high and you need thyroid medication. You also need your FreeT3, FreeT4 tested to determine how much thyroid hormone is in your body.Also, get the antibody tests: TGab and TPOab to determine if Hashimoto's is causing this high TSH. Finally, get a thyroid ultrasound.Once you get your TSH levels down and your frees up, then if you still have problems with your monthly, I suggest the birth control pill.That's what I did. I have Hashimoto's. Despite the fact that my frees had come up, I still had awful monthlies. One month hardly anything, and the next month clotting. I had endometriosis three years ago. I also birthed a preemie six years ago. Lots of female issues.I take the birth control pill at night and my thyroid pills in the morning and I'm doing much better.:) Tamra",
