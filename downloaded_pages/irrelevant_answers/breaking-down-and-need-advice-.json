Portion control is the main thing. Its not horrible. I was very upset when I found out. I am almost 34 weeks and found out at 27. I have a healthy baby girl in there that they do moniter closer for her weight but dont stress about it. Stress will make your sugar higher. Just listen to your specialist and remember it is all worth it in the end. You can do this. Dont let it scare and stress you.",

I have gd as well.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with it at 29 weeks and then the clinic didn't get me the referral to the specialist till I was about 33 weeks. My Dr then freaked me out saying I could have a still born or a huge baby and such but so far my baby is very healthy and the only thing I have is lots of fluid bc of the gd. Just like badyas said you'll have to monitor and portion control your food and what you eat , that's all.",
