            "answer": "I hope that when you feel this way you do an immediate glucose test to see what your glucose level is at the time. I would also strongly suggest that you wait 15 minutes to a haf hour if the glucose number is NOT hypoglycemic and test again. I am not a physician, but am a long-time type 1 (35 years on insulin). What you are feeling MAY be the actual dropping of your glucose numbers even if they are not below normal when you first test. Many diabetics can feel when their glucose levels are dropping fast. I am one of these, and I have learned that my feelings are ALWAYS correct, even if the glucometer shows me to have a healthy glucose number at the time. If I do a second test in a half hour, I will always see that the number dropped considerably and what I was feeling was the dropping gluocse. So for me, personally, I treat this sensation with juice or other carbs and then test again. I have heard from other diabetics who can sense the drop also.As for the symptoms being different from the norm, I think you will find as years go by that there are MANY different types of symptoms of hypoglycemia. Sometimes you can get dizzy, at other times you simply get sleepy, and sometimes you think clearly but are unable to command your muscles properly. Although the symptoms are different (different parts of the brain control different life functions and it sort of seems that different parts of the brain are having difficulty at different times), all point to hypoglycemia. Don't guess about it -- do an immediate finger ***** and if normal and the symptoms are continueing, do another one 15 minutes to one half hour later, with coke or juice handy. The panicky feeling is also a symptom of hypoglycemia, and sometimes depression hits hard with hypoglcyemia. The quick drop may well be your problem.If you are experiencing increased heartbeat when this happens, you may also want to ask your doctor to check your thyroid levels, for many type 1 diabetics have thyroid abnormalities at some time in their lives. The same immune system problem that causes the body to attack the insulin-producing cells can also cause it to attack the thyroid and produce odd symptoms such as heart palpitations. You also may have low blood pressure. I would do the glucose checks and treat with juice if necessary, but also talk about this to your doctor if it keeps happening, for it may be a symptom of some other problem that can be easily fixed once diagnosed. I wish you the best.",

            "answer": "As you probably know, we're not physicians here, but there's lots of real world experience here among the folks who post.\u00a0\u00a0I have had \"fleeting\" episodes like you describe, but they don't last more than a few seconds.My advice is to begin to record all the details around the times of those episodes.\u00a0\u00a0Time of day, day of week, location (home, school, work, \"out\"), blood sugar and all the physical symptoms you feel.\u00a0\u00a0Also note what you do to feel better & how long it takes to do so.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, note your stress level when the symptoms happend.\u00a0\u00a0I understand you would feel a bit panicky once it starts, but try to note how you felt before it all started.\u00a0\u00a0There might be environmental triggers to your emotions that begin a chain of events.Some insulins have shorter/longer peaks and duration.\u00a0\u00a0Do you notice any patterns related to the time interval between when you take a shot and when you have these episodes?Your a1c is pretty good, so your overall management seems good.\u00a0\u00a0GOOD FOR YOU!!\u00a0\u00a0Another avenue to consider is your blood pressure and/or potential side effects from other medications you take.\u00a0\u00a0Those symptoms can be caused by many factors, including low blood sugar.Talk with your diabetes specialist about these other ideas if they seem like they might help explain what you're experiencing.\u00a0\u00a0Tune in again, because I'm sure you'll hear from others.",

    "question": "I am wondering if anybody here has made the same experience - I am suffering on a Diabetes Type 1 since 1998.\u00a0\u00a0My HBA1 is ok (6,7) and my problem is either Hypoglycemia than Hyperglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0Does anybody know the following symptoms: increased heartbeat and pulse, vertigo and the feeling to get unconsious any minute? This attack has a duration of 5 - 15 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0It happened four times to me. After the first time I made a medical check-up which brought no results.\u00a0\u00a0I had the impression that my blood suger decreased very fast and that the mentioned symptoms I were some kind of special alert.-very different from the \"normal\" symptoms of a Hypoglycemia-\u00a0\u00a0(I helped myself drinking a lot of coke and tried not to panic)Anyway, your comments, advice or explaination are very welcome.\u00a0\u00a0 The fact that I am not sure what is happening to me in these moments really scares me.\u00a0\u00a0When I do not know what it is, I cannot react properly. And this multiplies my panic in this situation a lot.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much in advance!",
