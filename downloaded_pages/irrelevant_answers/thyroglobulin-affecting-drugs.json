            "answer": "Thyroglobulin gene\u00a0\u00a0is regulated by Insulin and Insulin-like Growth Factor I, As Well As Thyrotropin, in FRTL-5 Thyroid Cells.Thyrotropin (TSH) is presumed to be the prime regulator of thyroid function because it stimulates almost every aspect of thyroid cell metabolism, including the production and secretion of thyroid hormones.Thyroglobulin, the major protein produced by the thyroid cell, is the macromolecularprecursor of the thyroid hormones.TSH increases thyroglobulin .Growth of FRTL-5 cells requires a medium containing insulin, serum,and TSH.Insulin and a component of serum, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I),increase the synthesis of thyroglobulin.So it seems that Insulin DOES have some effect on Thyroglobulin and that a drug isnt the only reason for the thyroglobulin to rise or elevate.Sounds complicated but isnt really.What it means is that insulin and thyroglobulin tend to elevate each other and someone who has both thyroid issues and diabetes has a hard job on their hands of regulating and maintaining levels.If BSL are up, then so too will thyroglobulin levels be elevated too.Hope that answers your question.",

            "answer": "Thank You very much for your quick answer, sure it does answer some questions.Do You (or anyone esle) know how much rise will happen to Thyroglobulin (TG) level due to one insulin injection?is it possible to elevate up to 100 ng/ml or higher from one or more insulin injections?and there are two new questions:1. what is the range of Thyroglobulin (TG) level for Graves' Disease (GD) patients?2. is there any kind of Thyroglobulin (TG) as a drug?Thanks again",

            "answer": "I dont know the range in the USA but here in Australia, it should be under 35 shows antibodies.Maybe someone from the USA can answer that more precisely for you.",

    "question": "Hi,from that I know, Thyroglobulin (TG) is elevated in Hyperthyroidism (including Graves' disease) or Differentiated Thyroid Carcinpma (DTC).Is there any drug affecting TG level and elevating serum TG (e.g. insulin)?How much is the impact?Would that be incresed to 100-200 ng/ml?Earliest responses are much appriciated.",
