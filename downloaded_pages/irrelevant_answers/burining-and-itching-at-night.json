            "answer": "Hi, this is an MS Forum, but I would like to offer one thought that may seem simplistic, but it might be a help.\u00a0\u00a0I practiced medicine for 23 years and frequently heard complaints like this, especially when I was in Chicago.In the fall and winter as the temps fall, we tend to wear heavier clothing that is more absorbant.\u00a0\u00a0This cloth is in closer contact with the skin and tends to absorb a lot of the oil from the skin.\u00a0\u00a0On top of this, the relative humidity falls.\u00a0\u00a0The skin dries out, and dry skin can itch severely.The typical locations of this itching are the thighs and the ankles, but it can happen anywhere.The solution is a good overall moisturizer like cream Eucerin, Cetaphil.\u00a0\u00a0Creams are much better than lotions as many of the lotions have a higher alcohol content.\u00a0\u00a0My only explanation for it happening at midnight is, if that is after you are in bed, your thighs may be warmer and that increases itching.Try a deep moisturizer before you go to bed.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe for the first week use it twice a day.This is an easy thing to try, even if it isn't the answer.Another thought is a an allergy to your detergent.\u00a0\u00a0If the moisturizer fails try a detergent without dyes and perfumes.I'm sure you will get a lot of different ideas, but I have seen this problem hundreds of times and simple dry skin is often the culprit.Quix, MD",

            "answer": "I've heard that dermatologists recommend using lotion within 3 minutes of showering, as the lotion keeps the moisture in the skin.In the winter I used to suffer from nighttime itchy legs a LOT, even though my skin didn't SEEM dry. I didn't really think dry skin was the problem. But I started using lotion right after my shower almost daily, especially during dry, cold weather. It works like a charm!",

    "question": "I get a burining and itching sensation in my inner thighs and lower legs at night around midnight. It happens mostly in the fall and winter. I have ulcerative colitis. I have been to a nuerologist and have no nerve damage. I take a vitamin b12 shot every month, but that has not helped. this has been going on for 2 years now. I have been tested for allergies and blood tested for diabetes all tests look good. Any advise",
