            "answer": "I'm not sure why you only have one response on this topic and concern, but blacking out is NEVER a good thing. Unless you literally meant \"blanking\" out and it wasn't a typo.\u00a0\u00a0Blanking out is something I consider a brain fart, and all of us get it at one time or another, but if your's is frequently occurring, you will definitely need to get that checked out by your primary physician.\u00a0\u00a0If you meant \"blacking\" out, It for sure could be related to your blood pressure, which in turn comes from the heart...that is the primary concern here.\u00a0\u00a0You will need to have an extensive cardiac workup if it has occurred again without you being seen for it.\u00a0\u00a0At age 18, it could also be related to schizophrenia, since that is about the age when symptoms are displayed.\u00a0\u00a0It's true that diabetics suffer from these type of symptoms as well, but at age 18, unless you are very obese, or have type 1 diabetes, the chances of that likelihood is slim.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you!",
