For the microangiopathic or \"Microvascular disease\", Aka small vessel disease, here's a quick link on EHow.http://www.ehow.com/about_5390847_microvascular-disease-symptoms.htmlAnd here's an article on Small vessel chronic ischemic diseasehttp://www.ehow.com/about_4740835_small-vessel-ischemic-disease.htmlSorry, other than what I just\u00a0\u00a0read on the subject, I have no experience with this.

            "answer": "Hi and welcome to the forum.Actually, there is quite a lot on the web about this disorder. Here is a post from MedHelp's Expert Forum on neurology that explains this succinctly:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Neurology/microangiopathic-disease-gliosis/show/330548You don't say what your symptojms have been, but unless you have a history of high blood pressure or other vascular problems, I'd be very leery of this MRI report. You are way too young to have what often is a symptomless disease of older people. We often hear of this diagnosis being fobbed off on people who are eventually diagnosed (correctly) with MS.Not saying this is the case with you, as I have no way of knowing. Just saying that this bears more investigation. Can you tell us more about yourself?ess",

            "answer": "Like ess said, I would be really cautious about accepting an MRI report that blames changes on any type of ischemia.\u00a0\u00a0As I have learned on this site;\u00a0\u00a0Only 30% fo people age 60 show any ischemic changes on an MRI and the probability drops each year.Do you have high blood pressure, diabetes or high cholesterol?\u00a0\u00a0Those things can possibly cause some ischemia.Many of us have MRI's that say the same thing in various wording.\u00a0\u00a0Some docs just explain our symptoms away.\u00a0\u00a0My first Neuro blamed some things on my weight, she also said in her report that I was too old to have MS.If you think something is wrong keep lookingRed",

            "answer": "I seem to have a similar disorder without any risk factors for the disease. It first showed up for me at the same age- I am 54 now. It often seems to end up being a nondiagnosis. For me. I was quite well and working for many years until recently I began to have symptoms again.What these forums have taught me is neuro problems are all on a continuum. Some people have abnormal MRI's with no noticeable impairment, some are very affected, some improve and some continue to struggle.There are others in the \"surviving neurological limboland\" forum with similar diagnoses, plus some here whose symptoms evolved and they ended up with an MS diagnosis.What is probably most important is what symptoms generated the MRI?There is a section on the right called health pages written by very admirable, knowledgeable people. You should check it out, plus I'll add one more link for you that I found useful http://yassermetwally.wordpress.com/2009/12/15/the-mri-white-disease-dilemma/",
