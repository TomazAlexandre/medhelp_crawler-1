            "answer": "Hello bonbons,Please keep in mind that I am NOT a medical professional.\u00a0\u00a0I am a volunteer here and my input is based on experience I have in caring for my son, now 10 who was dd with type 1 at age 3.\u00a0\u00a0In addition my sis (33 yrs. old) was dxd at age 24.My sister is a Licensed Esthetician so she knows a lot about skin care and waxing.\u00a0\u00a0I called her to reiterate your question to her.\u00a0\u00a0Her response was that most likely you have heard things about it not being good for diabetics to wax due to the fact that they might be at an increased risk for infection than a person living without diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0She also stated that glycolic acid (as found in some facial cleansers) is derived from sugar so it would be similar to saying that if she cleans her face with a glycolic cleasner it will affect her blood sugar.Again, I am not a medical professional and have not heard about waxing and diabetics because I have a little boy:)\u00a0\u00a0But, I wanted to run it by my sis becuause of her knowledge.\u00a0\u00a0(in skin care and having diabetes)By the way....very good question.You may receive other comments with other theories, but this is the only input I had to give.\u00a0\u00a0My sister answered right away when I called her and I trust her answer, but then again, she is my sister:)Take care!!!SS",

            "answer": "I'm another volunteer and also not a medical professional.\u00a0\u00a0I have had Type 1 for 35+ years.SS is right that we can't \"absorb\" sugar thru our skin.\u00a0\u00a0The sugar and other carbos we eat get digested and -- eventually -- converted into glucose that's in our blood and nourishes our cells.\u00a0\u00a0We can't digest thru our skin so what's on the skin isn't being converted into glucose.I have used \"sugaring\" ... and make my own mixture of sugar, water & lemon ... to remove unwanted hair.\u00a0\u00a0The caution for diabetics is that there is trauma to the skin that endures waxing or sugaring and if someone has neuropathy and cannot feel heat or pain, they could do severe damage to their skin.\u00a0\u00a0Spa personnel might be very well trained or they might inadvertantly cause some harm.Check with your endocrinologist before going further.\u00a0\u00a0S/He will be able to guide you -- based on your particulars -- whether waxing or sugaring would be a reasonable risk for you to take.\u00a0\u00a0If yuo get the green light, you might seek out a middle-eastern woman who can show you how to make your own mixture (costs pennies for many months' supply) and how to safely do the technique.",

    "question": "I've been looking into using wax & its recommended diabetics do not wax. I just read a previous answer to a waxing question that it may have to do with neuropathy.I was wondering if the amount of fructose, glucose & maltrose used in the wax may be another reason?Is it possible that they could be absorbed through the skin?",
