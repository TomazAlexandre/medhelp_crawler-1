            "answer": "Dear slobbery,Thank you for reaching out to our forum. While I am a volunteer and not a physician, I have tried to do a little research on this possible side effect that your son experienced while using humalog. My son has used it without any problems and I personally had never heard of a behaviour problem associated with its use. Having said that, I did find a wesite associated with the National Institute of Health that shows some of the side effects of humalog.It states that one of the more common side effects is irritability or abnormal behavior. The fact that you took him off it twice and his behavior returned to normal seems like a red flag to me. I'm sorry your son's consultant brushed off your concerns with such ease. I know how very frustrating this can be. As a mother of a 27-year-old son diagnosed at 8 I am fortunate to have had only a few incidents where I felt I wasn't being listened to. A few is too many however when you are the advocate for your child.I will give you the website where I found this information and maybe you can print it out to show to your child's consultant if you like.It is mplus.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/uspd:/203622.html.I hope this helps and look for other comments from others with possible additional information.Best of Luck,dm",

            "answer": "Completely agree with you slobbery. my daughter uses regular insulin since 9 years old now she is 20 and was put on Humalog 25 mix pen and the thing about the aggresive behavoir is true. last week we had to take her to a hospital with a descompensation almost commatose.\u00a0\u00a0I check another forum and it appears the pen humalog works well for adults over 30, 40 50 etc or so but by reading your case I believe it is not suitable for kids with diabetes type I.We pounded on her doctor until he finally and reluctantly agreed to report the insuline - pen failure to Lilly. This is the second time it happens to us, the first time it was due to another pen called Insuman, and Lantus in pen type they proved innefective and costed us lots of money in hospital. I wish this doctor or company reimburses us for all these freightening episodes as well as expenses caused by this pens that resulted in fraud for us.",

    "question": "My 9 year old son was changed to Humalog in October.\u00a0\u00a0Within 24 hours we noticed a complete change of personality.\u00a0\u00a0He became moody, violent to his siblings, abusive and completely unpleasant nearly all of the time.\u00a0\u00a0We stuck it out for a week and then changed him back to his normal insulin.\u00a0\u00a0His behaviour went back to normal very quickly.We then put him back on the humalog and left him on it.\u00a0\u00a0His behaviour became worse overnight and continued like this until just before Christmas when we made the decision to take him off the humalog again for good.\u00a0\u00a0It took 3 days this time for his behaviour to return to normality.I mentioned these problems to his consultant who was very scathing and dismissive and told me the behaviour problems were due to his low blood sugar, even though he regularly has bad hypos on his normal insulin.Has anyone else had these problems and can anyone shed any light on the situation?",
