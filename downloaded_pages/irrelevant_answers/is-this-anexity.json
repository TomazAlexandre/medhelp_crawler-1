            "answer": "Yes, congrats on the weight loss. If you want to keep losing weight, I would try and stay away from medication and try natural methods of diminishing anxiety. Breathing and relaxation techniques would help the best. From experience with SSRI's such as Zoloft and Lexapro they both made me gain 20+lbs of weight. When I went off of them I lost all the weight. A lot of doctors are stating it slows your metabolism (so I Read). I'm not a professional I just know from recent experience that I faced.",

            "answer": "I just felt compelled to reply to your story cause it is almost exactly what i went through.\u00a0\u00a0I was really sick for about 9 months and the doctors had me on paxil and ativan for about 2 but they only made me worse.\u00a0\u00a0I was in the emergency room 6 times in 2 months and was seeing 2 doctors a week for about 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0I was having all the symptoms your having,\u00a0\u00a0I also had a lot of nausea and vomiting and chest pains.\u00a0\u00a0I am totally against drugs now and I dont take anything, not even tylenol.\u00a0\u00a0I started getting myself better the natural way by getting the fearful negative thoughts out of my head and replacing them with positive thoughts, although that was very hard at first and I didnt think it would work. after a few months of doing that I started noticing a change.\u00a0\u00a0I also started eating really healthy and doing yoga, mediating, taking\u00a0\u00a0some herbs occasionally and doing things i enjoy.\u00a0\u00a0one of the things I realized was that I had become extremely fearful and weak.\u00a0\u00a0It takes a while to rewire your brain but its definetly possible. Now when i start to have symptoms I just do deep breathing and remember that its only the adrenaline flowing through my body and that I can control the symptoms and they go away.\u00a0\u00a0I notice that if im doing something I enjoy like taking classes that I like or spending time with friends and family I dont have symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0It took a long time to get to where you are and its going to take a while to get out, but you just have to be strong and try to be happy and most importantly remember thats its your fear thats causing your anxiety and you can get it under control",
