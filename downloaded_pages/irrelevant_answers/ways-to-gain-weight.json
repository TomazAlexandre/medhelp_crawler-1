            "answer": "What is TC?Diabetes type 1 or 2If you are certain about her diagnosis with an eating disorder then that is the place to start otherwise it will be difficult for to even willingly try to gain weight. Trust me, if she is still active in her eating disorder then it is unlikely she will adhere to any kind of proper nutrition to sustain let alone absorb HCV meds\u00a0\u00a0Ditto with Diabetes. Truly there is no plainer way to say you might want to encourage your mum into some kind of therapy before addressing conditions that require adherence to longer term treatment. Her eating disorder is probably the only thing in her life that makes her feel like she has any sense of control over right now and it would behoove you to be sure she is in remission before you take her at her word if she says she is.",

            "answer": "Drinking when you have hep C is like pouring gasoline on a fire.Plus she would not be eligible for a transplant, at least not here in the US. I'm not sure of the rules in New Zealand.How you help her is to first help her with her addiction.You don't state what drugs she's using but drinking,drug addiction and hep C sounds sounds like a fast ride downhill.She may not be clear headed enough to understand how she is killing herself or she may not be able to stop her addictive behavior.If she won't get help, YOU go to an addiction counselor and tell them truthfully everything about your mother and ask them, how to help her.I wish I could be of more help but I'm just a person who had hep C, typing on a computer.Good luck.",

They will give you ways to help both of you.http://www.medhelp.org/forums/Addiction-Substance-Abuse/show/77Honestly though, you might want to discourage her from drinking if you can. That little bit could go a long way.I wish you good luck to both you and your mum.",

            "answer": "My error. I did not realize that TC meant Diabetes Type 1. If she has Type 1 Diabetes, she should not drink Ensure (flavored liquid supplement, looks like milk, comes in a can) unless she talks with her doctor about it and he/she says it is okay to drink it. Ensure and products like Ensure can affect/increase\u00a0\u00a0blood sugar and may throw the person out of stability.Of course, alcohol consumption can do the same thing.And, I agree with the others, she needs treatment for her drug addiction. She is not going to stabilize until she gets treatment for her drug addiction.I also agree with the others that you need to seek help for yourself so that you can cope with her addiction and behavior. Her situation is the result of her own poor decisions and not getting the help she needs. I know it is a disease process, but she is doing nothing to help herself. Her situation is NOT your fault. I know this is a very difficult situation for you, but no matter what happens, it is not your fault. If there is an addiction center nearby or any group that works with the families of addicts, that would be a place to go to get some help and counseling for yourself. They should be able to tell you the best way to approach helping your mother.I certainly do not want to appear to tell you what to do, but moving back in with her may potentially allow her/enable her to continue doing drugs, drinking, and not eating. If you move in and take care of her, she does not have to change a thing and she can continue her destructive behavioral pattern. Plus, it will tear you apart emotionally. That is why you need to get some help for yourself to learn how to deal with your mother and the situation.I am not speaking from a vacuum here. I lived with an alcoholic for years. That type of situation causes an immense amount of stress in the caregiver/concerned person and it often does not help the addict herself.Can you and some family and her friends and her pastor do an Intervention and get her into treatment. Intervention is really an effective method to get people to change their behavior and get help. (Won't work every time, but it very frequently does.) Every Intervention I have participated in or heard about has worked and the person got help and stopped the addiction. Often times people are ready to stop. They just need help to stop. (And by help, I do not mean enabling.)Here is some information about Intervention. You will need help from others. Confronting her by yourself won't work. You need a group that will not back down from her and can refute all of her excuses. You will need to have the treatment plan/place all lined up and ready for her to enter at the end of Intervention.http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/intervention/MH00127/I also agree with Idyllic. It would be a good idea to post on the Addiction forum. You will probably get some very good help and advice on that forum.You are very young to have to deal with this situation. Best of luck to you.",
