    "question": "I have posted a few times that my wife and I are spending a few months taking care of my mother in law.\u00a0\u00a0She has renal failure, high blood pressure, diabetes and had a major heart attack a month ago.Her two sisters and brother in law flew over from Italy yesterday. They have been separated for many years and none of the Italians had visited here in the US before now.\u00a0\u00a0They are all in their 80s and frail now.\u00a0\u00a0Within a few minutes of arrival, the party started!\u00a0\u00a0The years melted away and they were all laughing and telling jokes - making fun of their sexual prowess at 80 and just having a wonderful time. I saw my mother in law smile for the first time in years!It was bittersweet though, I realized that this is most likely the last time they will ever all be together again.\u00a0\u00a0I decided to take out my camera and capture as much of this as possible for the all the grandchildren.\u00a0\u00a0This is a wonderful experience watching the love they all share melt away the years and blunt the pain of loss, age and disease!Family can be one of the most wonderful of life's offerings - not always though :).Eric",
