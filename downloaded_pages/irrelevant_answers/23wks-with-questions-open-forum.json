I am 23wks due June 1 and due to a really rocky start with over stimulated ovaries as I was on fertility injections I have gained only about 2kg (4lb) but I have a pregnant belly just not much weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0I have to have my 3hr glucose test in a week and half as I have PCOS and risk of gestational diabetes...bub already measures 1 week+ ahead of itself and we know exact day and time we conceived.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully the test will be fine and bub will just come when ready.Regarding the wearing of protection, that is wise but cos it has only been like 2-3times we or I have felt like anything it is kind of cruel especially knowing we are pregnant and no need to be careful not to get pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I dont want dh to feel like he is doing it to me..making me have uti's.\u00a0\u00a0It is hard enuf getting him to even go there as he has this thing of it may hurt the baby..lol argh well, if it keeps me from having yucky discharge I guess there is no other alternative.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks heaps",
