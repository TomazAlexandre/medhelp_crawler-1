            "answer": "I don't believe I've heard of, nor have I ever experience sweating as being a normal reaction to acidic foods in particular, though if you were to eat very spicy hot food, that could be a normal reaction.However, I do have a lot of tachycardia (rapid heart rate) and the heart does have to work harder when digesting.\u00a0\u00a0And of course, if you had a rapid heart rate, you might sweat.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm curious about your heart rate at such times.\u00a0\u00a0 A rapid heart rate can be a symptom of a serious allergic reaction, so, particularly if it turns out that's what is causing your sweating, I think you should explore with an allergist whether or not you might be allergic to the things that make you sweat.",

            "answer": "If you can take your pulse for fifteen seconds and times that number by four or if you have a stethoscope and can listen for a minute to how many beats happen during that time, those are ways you should be able to discover if your heartrate is rapid.\u00a0\u00a0I think it wouldn't hurt to see an allergist to test for various food allergies.",

            "answer": "Please see post above.Also, I think it likely if you were to have a rapid heart rate as an allergic reaction (which I saw online), it would be part of a very serious reaction that would have other symptoms present at the same time... so, it is quite possible that particular idea is not the on the right track- I'm sorry I did not mention this earlier.",

            "answer": "Thinking more, diabetes I remember is associated with increased appetite and you had mentioned lack of appetite and I looked and saw those fruits do not have a high glycemic index, and your normal blood sugar really rules that idea out!I'm sorry I've been leading you on a wild goose chase here.\u00a0\u00a0The article I sent you seemed to link eating and sweating with a possible thyroid problem, but as you pointed out, you only have a problem with certain foods which would seem like that wouldn't fit.However... a lack of appetite, which you mentioned you have (on another thread), according to this credible website:http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003121.htmlists hypothyroidism as a possible cause of a decrease in appetite.\u00a0\u00a0Hypothyroidism can also lead to depression, which you mentioned having.\u00a0\u00a0(Although depression itself, which can come on for many reasons, can also cause a lack of appetite.)\u00a0\u00a0Generally, your primary care doctor should routinely check on thyroid function, so you might check to see if they have done blood testing for this recently.",
