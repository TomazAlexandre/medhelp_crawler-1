I seriously laugh when people post they feel bad for having a few pieces of candy or a bite of cake etc. I definitely don't wanna gain tons of weight but if I want pizza then I have pizza. I balance that meal with my other meals. :-) and a bowl of icecream isn't gonna hurt the baby. :-) of course, just my luck my lil guy isn't happy if I eat sweets...makes me sick. Lol but he loves carbs! Haha... Thanks for this post! I needed a smile today.",

            "answer": "The thing is many people overindulge.\u00a0\u00a0You also have to consider that by the time they want sweets, they have eaten a lot of hidden sugar. Sugar is added into everything from cereal to spaghetti sauce. Most people aren't making foods from scratch or reading labels so by the time they indulge in that piece of cake or ice cream, they have already gone over the recommended amount of sugar for the day. It is easier for people to identify sugar in sweets than in everyday food items. Our society needs nutrition lessons.",

I don't feel bad at all about anything I eat.. it's not like I overdo it. I still eat plenty of protein, meats, vegetables, fruit, etc. nothing wrong with ice cream every night if I want it.. I haven't gained a pound. good luck!! (((:",

    "question": "I don't understand why people are so scared of eating a bite of cake or a couple pieces of candy. I have a sweet tooth and always have, I eat sweets EVERYDAY! Either a small bowl of ice cream or maybe a chocolate muffin after dinner. Mind you, I eat extremely well aside from dessert, fruits vegetable lean meat etc.\u00a0\u00a0Im healthy, and so ismy baby. I just find it odd that people deprive them self's of a yummy treat when pregnant but turn around and eat a fast food 3 nights a week (gross) but what brothers me more is when they post about it and people say \"yes sugar is bad, you shouldn't even drink juice, you should drink crystal light instead\" (seen that about 3 times) crystal light??? That sh i t should be banned, not only does it hold no nutritional value but its made of artificial sweeteners? Where's the logic ? I may just be in a bad mood, and annoyed. Am I the only one that feels this way? Don't getme wrong, I'm all about being healthy and ensuring baby is healthy, but it cracks me up people think twice about\u00a0\u00a0sweet but\u00a0\u00a0think its okay to drink or smoke pot?",
