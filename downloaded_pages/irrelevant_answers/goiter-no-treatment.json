            "answer": "The symptoms that you are experiencing points to being hypo and without treatment they can escalate and get worse, The docs go by what the normal ranges are and not what level range your result is at, which they should...because alot of patients are within normal range but do have hypo symptoms. I was, before i had the surgery.Do not allow docs to fool you by saying that other health issues are not related to the thyroid, sooo not true.",
