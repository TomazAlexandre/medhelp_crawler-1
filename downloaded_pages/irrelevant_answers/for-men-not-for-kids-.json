            "answer": "I am the volunteer for today, so I wanted to make sure I responded to you.\u00a0\u00a0I am a female with diabetes for 27 years.\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to say that I understand everything you are going through, but I can sympathize with many things you are saying. Diabetes is VERY frustrating.First an HbA1C is a test that measures the amount of glycosylated hemoglobin in your blood. Glycosylated hemoglobin is a molecule in red blood cells that attaches to glucose (blood sugar). You have more glycosylated hemoglobin if you have more glucose in your blood.The test gives a good estimate of how well diabetes is being managed over the last 2 or 3 months.(from http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003640.htm)You strive for your HbA1C to be at or below 7.0, I do not know what yours is, but I would listen to my doctor about maintaining good control.\u00a0\u00a0I would try to get a better handle on guessing.\u00a0\u00a0I would keep a food journal and blood sugar readings journal, sounds like a pain, but I think it will help you understand your body a little bit better.\u00a0\u00a0Try going to a dietician and find out if your diet could be tweaked a little to maintain better control.\u00a0\u00a0I feel so much better when my blood sugars are under control.If you look in the archives of this forum I believe there are some questions related to your question that might be helpful.",

            "answer": "Hi there fellafirst let me say \"your body is a wondrous piece of work and I feel you need to get to know it better from the inside out\" being a former pastor I think is the first step. you saw stupidity and confusion in the place you were at and you do not suffer fools well! me too. you know your body is a temple and being so it needs to be maintained. The person before has given you some good food for thought but I think you might need a bit more education on the real you. I have been a diabetic\u00a0\u00a0(man's term) for about 16 years and never until now was I controlled. I have ED and a host of many other things always trying to dog me. The trick is not to let it. easy to say I hear you think. not so. as a person with intelligence and coming from where you came in theology you would be aware of your spiritual condition. the spirit which is God within you the hope of glory is a complete thing just waiting for the body to catch up. this will happen when we forget about what we think controls us and realize what makes us - which is nothing short of love. what is the treasure you have in your earthen vessel? friend I would love to chat to you more and build you higher than everest itself - this chat is limited. please check out my post. if you wish to chat even more I have a profile on facebook, just search \"samusay\" just to let you know I am married and my wife loves my sloppy man meat. its not what you have its how you use your tool. you have a great day mate.sam",

            "answer": "Ok thanks a lot guys for the responses...I've taken what yall have said to heart... I've basically been watching my BS every hour or more lately.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I've got a lot better control over it.\u00a0\u00a0Matter of fact, my last H1C or wahtever came out 5.9!\u00a0\u00a0I was pretty surprised actually to hear that, as was my doctor because he said he wouldn't be surprised if it was 8.0.Unfortunately, the ED problem has not gotten any better.\u00a0\u00a0I was subscribed viagra, used it one time, but wasn't real satisfied as the side effects were kinda harsh... although I did get it up.It seems like trying to get a meeting with the president to see my doctor or a urologist, but I'm trying to get in with one to see what I can do for the future.\u00a0\u00a0Obviously I'm working on getting better control, and Ive already been exercising.My doctor said that he thought it would clear up and, \"Return to normal\" after regaining better control over the BS for a while... awhile I guess being months or years I dont know...Its interesting because right before this happend I got a urinary tract infection and started taking antibodies to help clear it up.\u00a0\u00a0It did clear up the frequent urination, but then the ED started.\u00a0\u00a0I dont know if the two would be related or not, but it just seems sudden.\u00a0\u00a0I'm suomewhat of a Buddhist so that goodness for that otherwise I'd probably have a hard time dealing with it, but theres got to be hope or answers out there.\u00a0\u00a0Again, I'm only 25, had this for six years, and felt I did a moderately decent job controlling in comparision to most guys in their early 20's (I haven't drank or smoked very much during that time).\u00a0\u00a0Do you think what my doctor said will ring true about it clearing up, and if so how long you think it will take, and will it be normal again?Thanks",

    "question": "I feel like I have the wieght of the world on my shoulders sometimes, AND then I have to worry about diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0>=)I'm 25... had type I diabetes since I was 19.\u00a0\u00a0I did shots up until about a year ago till I switched to the pump.\u00a0\u00a0This winter I noticed I was urinating WAY too much and it was starting to become irritating/painful.\u00a0\u00a0I knew something was up, so my family doctor put me on anti-bacterial medicine for a possible tract infection (Been on them all week and I think its working).\u00a0\u00a0BUTTTTTTTTTTT... heres the kicker...I'm 25 for God sake... I had sex last weekend, but couldn't maintain an erection for actual intercourse.\u00a0\u00a0Now I'm finding that even when I masturbate its hard (no pun intended) for me to maintain a strong erection.\u00a0\u00a0I saw my diabetic doctor today and he said its because my blood sugars have been up and down lately.\u00a0\u00a0(I'm kind of a guesser sometimes and I get in a habit of it with counting carbs to insulin)I check my blood sugar 5+ times a day, but I guess I shouldn't guess so much in terms of counting carbs to insulin.\u00a0\u00a0My doc think the, \"ED\" (erectile dysfunction) is due to a high Hemoglobin A1C or whatever the hell that is called.\u00a0\u00a0He thinks if I lower it over the next month or so the ED should clear up and hopefully have normal full erections again.\u00a0\u00a0THIS IS SCARY STUFF FOR ME.. and its a lot to freaking handle when I'm 25 AND LIFES A ***** OUTSIDE OF DIABETES!!\u00a0\u00a0I mean for God's sake I think this is more than anyone man should EVER have to deal with!Any men who feel me PLEASE SPEAK TO ME!!\u00a0\u00a0Give me some hope or something (AND DONT TELL ME GOD cause I'm a former pastor!)\u00a0\u00a0I'm gonna join a support group but they dont meet very often (Like once a month... maybe)\u00a0\u00a0I'm going to try not to, \"Guess\" I guess but I check my blood A LOT and feel like I do a, \"Fair\" job of regulating it... but Doc says no.\u00a0\u00a0I mean **** is anybody perfect? I'm finnaly having sex and then I get ED!!\u00a0\u00a0Come on!!!",
