            "answer": "PCOS can make conceiving difficult because it is hard to determine when you will ovulate.\u00a0\u00a0Also if you have very long cycles it is possible that the egg is \"geriatric\" by the time it ovulates (i.e, in a regular cycle it ovulates on day 14, but if you have a 50 day cycles, it ovulates on day 36 and has been subjected to 22 days more exposure to hormones in the ovary which can age it and make conceiving difficult).\u00a0\u00a0PCOS is not really serious and can be treated (I have PCOS and am pregnant now with the help of femara, metformin and HCG trigger) but it does put you in a category of higher risk factors for all sorts of stuff like diabetes, etc.\u00a0\u00a0My advice(but I am not a doctor!) is if you have PCOS and want to get pregnant get on clomid or femara which will help you ovulate sooner, also you may take metformin to reduce any insulin resistance that causes PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0That is what I did and it worked!!\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

            "answer": "Hi,I was diagnosed with PCOS in Oct 07, this was after i went to the doctor and questioned that i have been off the pill for over 2 years but still can not get pregnant. They took several blood tests and then told me i had PCOS, they have told me to loose some weight and take metformin 3 times a day taking my daily intake to 1500mg. I have sucessfully ovulated every month but have not yet falled pregnant.I came off the metformin for 2 weeks after my last period, i have been feeling sick, dizzy and i have to vomit after each meal. I thought i was actually pregnant, but i started the metfirmon again and as a result my period after 1 week came back, i still feel all the symtons. I have not done a pregnacy test.Mt question to you is can metformin bring on a false period even id you are pregnant or should i take this as a sign and try again?",
