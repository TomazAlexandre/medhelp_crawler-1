            "answer": "This is a diabetes forum yet you do not mention diabetes anywhere in your post. However, I'm somewhat familiar with liver diseases so I'll respond as best as I can considering the limited amount of information in your post.\"The doctor has run two sets of tests and his liver enzymes have come back high...\"What are the \"two sets of tests\"? By keeping this a secret makes it hard to answer..\"The only real indication she has given is possible liver cancer.\"What indication? Again you've kept this a secret. The marker for liver cancer [Hepatoma Carcinoma (HCC)] is an AFP [alpha feta protein] test. Other tests that coincide are BUN, alkaline phosphatase, and kidney impairment [creatinine], just to name a few. If these test results return high, the doctor may order a CT Scan with Contrast fluid and/or an MRI to see if the liver is scarred/marked and/or has a lesion. ie. signs of cirrhosis or a tumor. If cancer is suspected, biopsies normally are not performed for fear of the biopsy needle hitting bad tissue [the lesion] then infecting good tissues as it enters the liver and as it is withdrawn. If the CT Scan or MRI results show cirrhosis a biopsy will be ordered to determine the health of the liver and also the extent of damage.\"In his history he spent two years in Argentina and had to come back to the States due to a parasite. No hepatitis present.\"When was this? How long ago? Has he been screened lately for parasites? There are three hepatitis tests; A, B and C. Which one[s]? And were the hep tests performed recently?You present a nice history but leave out many facts. I also wonder why you are posting for your boyfriend and not he?FYI, a few signs of liver disease are:1. Excessive loss of body hair; on sheets and on tub/shower drain2. Night sweats3. Possible severe itching in spots, not all over4. Dark coca cola colored urine5. Yellowish\u00a0\u00a0or very dark stools6. Blood in toilet during bowel movement",

            "answer": "thank you so much for your reply... you have made valid points! I will be sure to follow up once I receive more information.I am posting for him as I am the one who is freaking out and feeling very nervous. I don't want to pound him with questions as it is very difficult for him to talk about it. I posted here as well as the liver disorders forum as I noticed a lot of his symptoms are similiar to diabetes as well.Thanks again for your help.",

But by all means if his doctor and test results suspects liver problems, get him referred to an Hepatologist, a doctor that specializes in liver disease. Rule #1 to protect the liver; zero alcohol/liquor, zero drugs.Good luck.",

    "question": "Hello, I am writing this with extreme gratitude for any information. If you have the slightest idea or suggestion please respond!My boyfriend is 27 years old, slightly overwieght (as he is/was naturally very thin but is now about 15-20lbs overweight), and he works out regularly. In the past year he has had bronchitis at least 3 times, his tonsils removed and has this awful dry cough that won't quit (i say for the past few months).In the past few months many symptoms have developed... He has become very fatigue, extremely thirsty, more sweaty, constantly runs high fevers for a few hours and then it will break, he seems depressed and unmotivated. He has been vomiting(up to a 10day spout), developed a dull pain on his side and back which comes in and out of severeity and has recently (the past few weeks) had a few spells of numbness in both legs (it has caused him to be unable to drive---- I literally had to reach over him to stop the car becuz he had lost all feeling!)The doctor has run two sets of tests and his liver enzymes have come back high... The only real indication she has given is possible liver cancer. He is not a drinker nor a smoker. In his history he spent two years in Argentina and had to come back to the States due to a parasite. No hepatitis present. They are looking to move forward with possibly an MRI or a biopsy.Please help! If you know of any tests we should request at this point. I am very very skeptical of doctors and feel it is best to try to become as knowledgable as possible to make sure we resolve this as quickly and effectively as possible. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you!",
