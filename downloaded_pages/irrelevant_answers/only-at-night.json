    "question": "Help me,I'm a 33yr old female. For about 7 years I've had these symptoms, enough is enough I need to figure it out.7-12 times a year I wake up from a sound sleep feeling extremely nauseous. I try going back to sleep but end up getting worse so I head to the bathroom. I have to sit on the toilet because I end up with diarreah and a bucket in front of me cause I think I'll be sick. Along with this I feel very dizzy and like I'm going to faint. I also get HOT and break out into a sweat. This will last anywhere from 5minutes to an hour.This last time I ended up in the ER because it lasted a lot longer and from my elbows down went completely numb. I couldn't feel the, at all and my hands cramped up and I couldn't move them, my feet were also starting to go numb.Does this sounds familiar to anyone. Please help me!!!",
