            "answer": "It is important to try to eat healthy because you can develop gestational diabetes which is scary for you and baby. Just try to replace cupcakes with watermelon, strawberries, or grapes. Its still sweet but its healthy for you too. If that doesn't work then at least offset your unhealthy cravings with something healthy. Like a cupcake and a salad. And keep taking your prenatals at least until your second trimester.",
