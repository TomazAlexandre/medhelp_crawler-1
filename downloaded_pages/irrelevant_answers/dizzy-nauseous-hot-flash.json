            "answer": "I had the same thing around the same weeks. Very similar story I would stand for awhile but not doing heavy work either. I did get a gestational diabetes test done & everything was perfect. It happened about 6 times at work before my Dr made me stop working. He said there wasn't really anything more serious other than standing for a long period of time. It cause your blood pressure to drop drastically which is why you suddenly start sweating & get really dizzy. Best advice is to try to move around every ten mins if possible. Go outside catch some air come back and you should be fine. Personally I couldn't handle it, nothing worked for me so I had to leave my job temporarily until my baby is born.",

    "question": "I called my triage nurses line because I have been having these like hot flashes at work when all of a sudden I feel like I'm going to faint I see spots and get really hot, nauseas and dizzy. I run to the bathroom because I think I'll throw up and I just sit there for a minute and it just goes away. I'm on my feet all day but when it happens I'm not working really hard. They told me to come in for an appointment asap and if it happens again go to the e.r.? I scheduled one for the morning. What could it be? She didnt really give me an explanation just said I need to be checked out. She said my blood pressure has been slightly elevated my last appointments but the nurse told me it was normal at the time? This only happens at work and it has happened 4 times now. I thought I was dehydrated so I've been drinking more water but it doesn't work. Could it be gestational diabetes I haven't been tested for it yet. Im only 21wks and I will be tested at 28wks. I really hope I don't have to be put on work restrictions or bed rest I just started this job 2wks ago...",
