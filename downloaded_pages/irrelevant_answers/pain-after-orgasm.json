            "answer": "Yes I would explain to primary. Primary may do EKG in office. But it will probably be wasted of $$. They should send u to a cardiologist for a stress test. If there is anything going on...it should pick it up. If u physically can't handle jogging on a treadmill for 5 min..(ugh it feels like forever) they may just order an ultrasound to view heart along with EKG. But u should def get a checkup. Best wishes",
