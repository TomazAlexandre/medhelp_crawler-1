            "answer": "Steroids and other health issues can affect blood sugar levels.While whole grain bread is better for you than white, it could still be increasing your blood sugar levels too much.Maybe you should reduce your bread intake and eat more vegetables and lean proteins and see if that helps bring your blood sugar levels down.\u00a0\u00a0Since you're have trouble keeping your levels steady, you should be very careful to keep your diet as low on the glycemic index as you can.",

            "answer": "Thanks Barb.\u00a0\u00a0I know a little about low glycemic index, but I find Dr.Sears book really hard to read and understand. It is \"Enter The Zone\" and he has a PhD and writes like an intelectual, way about my pay grade.\u00a0\u00a0I am on WW and have lost my weight that way, with walking for exercise.\u00a0\u00a0I eat lean protein, veggies, and salads most of the time.\u00a0\u00a0I love fruit, but limit it , to a day when I have carbs to spare.\u00a0\u00a0As for the wheat bread, it is really hard to eat a sandwich without it.\u00a0\u00a0I found some whole wheat/ black bean tortillas, and I make a wrap with that, instead of bread.\u00a0\u00a0 When I eat a hamburger, I order two small ones, and only use the tops of the buns which are less dense, and get double meat and veggies.\u00a0\u00a0I know I have to stop eating things that hurt me, and I really am trying hard.\u00a0\u00a0I've only known about my problem less than a year, and am trying to work my way through all the things I've been learning.",

            "answer": "Congratulations on losing weight; I've recently been diagnosed with pre-diabetes, so I'm trying to control my diet in order to avoid full blown diabetes.There are a lot of articles on the internet that are very easy to understand about the low glycemic diet.\u00a0\u00a0I can't get into someone who doesn't write so everyone can understand it.I limit fruit, as well, and when I do eat it, I try to stay with the ones that have the most fiber, such as apples, pears, cherries, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I, too, remove the bun from burgers, but I don't get double meat, because there's typically too much fat in restaurant burgers.Here's a good article on glycemic diet: http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/glycemic-index-diet/MY00770There are many others, as well.\u00a0\u00a0Simply google \"low glycemic diet\" and there will be a lot of articles that come up.\u00a0\u00a0Some even give examples of where different foods rank in the glycemic index.We all have some difficulty getting used to new diets...... it hasn't been easy for me, either.",

    "question": "I eat hi carb foods, or low carb foods, and my blood sugar does not come down when I eat the low carbs, it stays in the 130-140 range even then.\u00a0\u00a0I eat whole wheat bread, and sometimes do go to hi carb foods, and then it peaks up in the hi 160's.\u00a0\u00a0I am on Trajenta, have lost 19 lbs, and walk 3-4 times a week.\u00a0\u00a0Recently I had two injections of steroids, but it was two weeks ago, so I doubt that is the cause.\u00a0\u00a0However, I am dealing with a number of health issues, and that is stressful, and I believe that is some of the root cause for the hi readings.\u00a0\u00a0I will see my doctor next month and have blood work done.\u00a0\u00a0With these hi readings I'm afraid my A1C will be up again, since it is the average over three months.",
