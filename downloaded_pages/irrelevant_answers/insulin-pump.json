            "answer": "I am not a physician, but the mom of a type one diabetic.I can tell you that it is not uncommon for teens that are on the pump to want to go back to shots. I have several friends that their kids have done this for several reasons.\u00a0\u00a0 I have asked some of them why.\u00a0\u00a0I was told basically that having something attached to your body 24/7 is not exactly \"COOL\".\u00a0\u00a0Looking normal (in the locker room at sleep over), is important at that age. Body self image is very critical, by the child and his/her peers at that age, Kids just want to fit in, and the pump does not help.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I can say that almost all of the teens I know that went off the pump have gone back on.I would suggest that your son talk to his endocrinologist about this and see if there are other teens in your area have diabetes that your son can talk to.\u00a0\u00a0I know that since we have joined a support group that my daughter feels better and does better with her diabetes.I would contact your local chapter of JDRF or hospital and see if they have and groups.I hope this helps, please check back and let me know how you are doing.",

            "answer": "I have been diabetic since i was 4 years old, i am 23 now. I did not get my pump until i was 18, but I know some of the feelings that the pump gives \"kids\" of that age. The pump, even though it can look like a pager, still feels \"different\" in a way. No matter how you look at it, from the diabetic's point of view, its still treatment and not a part of the \"normal teenage body.\" I dont know if that makes any sense to you at all? I know when i wanted to go out with friends and have fun, i wanted to take my pump off just so i would not be different. I hope this helped some? Good Luck and God Bless you and your family. If you need to talk, or he wants to talk about how he is feeling, my email address is ***@****",

            "answer": "i dont mean to be blunt, but at 17 all guys think about is sex and friends. Peer pressure is really bad. I am 36 and married and it still bothers me(a little) with the sex thing with my wife. Its a very personal problem and tough to talk about. going back to shots \"hides\" diabetes. I hope all goes well...jsut posting a guys point of view.",

            "answer": "Another reason - sometimes you just get tired of the tiny holes the cannula leaves behind.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes they're not noticable, sometimes you hit a patch of skin that just gets irritated.\u00a0\u00a0Although they heal with time, they're annoying.\u00a0\u00a0Or itch.\u00a0\u00a0Although it's trivial in the overall diabetes perspective - you just get sick of the pump routine, checking for air in the lines, pulling out sites and hoping no gushers happen, putting in new sites ....It's really a matter of what works best for him.\u00a0\u00a0If shots work and his BG is stable and he feels good - then maybe the pump wasn't for him.\u00a0\u00a0The pump's not for everyone.\u00a0\u00a0I know diabetics who would never use it and prefer shots.",

    "question": "Hi, my 17 yo son has been a diabetic since age 12.\u00a0\u00a0He got an insulin pump 2 years and seemed pleased with it.\u00a0\u00a0However, last month I discovered he was not wearing his pump.\u00a0\u00a0He had gone back to giving himself shots of insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone else experienced this? And if so, can you help me to understand why he would want to\u00a0\u00a0go back to taking shots?\u00a0\u00a0He has had a very difficult time adjusting to his diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0His BS runs high often that is when he tests. I am at my wits end!\u00a0\u00a0I just wish I could take control of his diabetes for him.\u00a0\u00a0I worry about him so much.Thank you for this forum.\u00a0\u00a0It helps just to write it out and get it out of my head.",
