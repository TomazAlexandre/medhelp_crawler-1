Sorry that I can't be of any more help, I have no info on this nor have\u00a0\u00a0I experienced it, but this could be an indication of a problem.--actually I take that back I looked it up for you and what popped up was gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia and even eclampsia, which is very serious. You probably shouldn't have waited until your third time experiencing this to bring it up, I would call your doctor as soon as you're able and tell him/her that this happened and let them run some tests on you.Look up \"eclampsia\" and \"eclamptic convulsions\"\u00a0\u00a0it could possibly be something less serious, but better safe than sorry!",
