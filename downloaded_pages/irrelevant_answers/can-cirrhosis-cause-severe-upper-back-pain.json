    "question": "Hello,My name is Jill, and I am 49 y.o.Long story short, car accident in 1999 which brought about three cervical surgeries in six years, culminating in damage to my vagus nerve.\u00a0\u00a0I was placed in a halo, in the hosp for ten days after the vagus nerve damage.\u00a0\u00a0In the next five days, I developed diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Within a month home, I developed gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0Now, two months ago, they discovered a 2.8 cm tumor in the head of my pancreas, and a smaller one, 1.2 cm\u00a0\u00a0(mass) cyst?\u00a0\u00a0on my liver.I was told that I have cirrhosis by an Internist who was treating my hypoglycemia in Nov. of 09, and now these masses?\u00a0\u00a0The first test was only an ultrasound, the second was a C/T.I am on SSI with only Medicare.\u00a0\u00a0My primary is a P.A. at a Rural Health Clinic.\u00a0\u00a0I have also fallen through the cracks.Also, I found out myself, that my pH is LOW.\u00a0\u00a0Under 7 in fact.\u00a0\u00a0I almost suspect metobolic acidosis, or diabetic acidosis, but I (again) digress!\u00a0\u00a0Sorry.The pain I originally posted about, occured three weeks ago, and again 10 days ago.\u00a0\u00a0The WORST vise-grip pain tight across my entire upper abdomen,, lower chect area.\u00a0\u00a0It felt like both a heart attack, and six broken ribs!!!\u00a0\u00a0Both times the pain did not subside for about four days.\u00a0\u00a0Also, immediate white or yellow stools.I do not drink, haven't for 24 years, but I drank my share from 19-26.\u00a0\u00a0Internist thinks the damage was lurking all these years.\u00a0\u00a0Now, I wonder what is my greater problem , liver?\u00a0\u00a0Pancreas? Or low pH?I am sorry this is all over the place.\u00a0\u00a0Not to pull the sympathy card,..but, I lost my 23 y.o. daughter four years ago, and I do not think I am quite ready to go join her YET, as I just had a Grandson born last Thurs., and I have another one due in 4 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I'd appreciate any guidance, support, info, etc,...Thank you so much for reading this and for your precious TIME!Jillofark",
