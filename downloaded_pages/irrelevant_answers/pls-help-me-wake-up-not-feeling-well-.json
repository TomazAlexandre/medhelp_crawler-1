            "answer": "I have been reading about Magnesium deficiency and that could be your problem.\u00a0\u00a0Although we get magnesium in our multivitamins, sometimes it's the wrong type.\u00a0\u00a0I personally switched from magnesium oxide to Magnesium Glyconate after doing some research on the different types of magnesium.Some of the symptoms of a lack of magnesium include:\u00a0\u00a0Lethargy, impaired memory, cognitive function, weakness, tremors, involuntary eye movements, calcium deficiency, potassium deficiency, irregular heartbeat, insomnia, numbness and tingling, salt cravings, ADHD, migraine, osteoporosis, premenstrual syndrome, diabetes, asthma, muscle twitching and spasms, stomach cramps, bad body odor, and the list goes on.\u00a0\u00a0You might want to look up magnesium deficiency online.Wishing you the best",

            "answer": "May be a good idea to get checked out for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0A hBA1c blood test would confirm whether you have a problem with sugar levels or not.When you wake up in the morning you have an empty stomach and very low sugar levels and this can give you the sensations that you feel.I presume that you start to feel better after having eaten breakfast and had a drink.It may help you to have a light snack an hour or so before you go to bed to see if that helps.",

            "answer": "Hypoglycemia can happen to people who do not suffer from diabetes.And it is when the sugar levels drops too low.I used to suffer with it a lot too and then was diagnosed as being glucose intolerant.\u00a0\u00a0When I started to feel hungry it would give me a headache, feeling very sick to the point that I was nearly throwing up.The slow energy release foods and not skipping on food is a good way to avoid hypoglycaemia.Carbs and sugary foods spike up the energy very quickly, but also the sugar levels in the blood drop quickly too.Best wishes.",

He would hold his breath at night and scare me half to death. This made him wake up a lot. By morning he was exhausted from such restless sleep.He needed to go to a neurologist and have a sleep study done. He has been using a C-Pap machine for the last 10 years and wakes up feeling completely rested.Just a thought!",
