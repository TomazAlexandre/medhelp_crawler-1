            "answer": "Well I haven't had these symptoms all my life but I have for the past few years. After finding out I had diabetes and trying to work on that, these symptoms have been a lot less. My doctors seem to think for me it is a combination of the diabetes, sleep apnea, hypothyroidism, and stress! And all that certainly doesn't help if you have any depression either.I don't know but I guess I would ask myself if any of these are any way producing any of these symptoms. Have you had checks done for diabetes or thyroid? Are you getting enough sleep during the night? How is your stress levels. They can do a number on you for sure.Have you went to another doctor to see if they find the same things?You got me though if it's been happening all your life.",

            "answer": "It could be Anxiety. When my anxiety was really bad I had the shortness of breath like I wasnt getting enough air, burning in my chest, severe fatigue, shakiness, heart and pulse would start beating out of my chest. Sometimes my pulse would just pound hard for hours with no signs of panic..Of course these could all be other things so I would continue to research (web md) and see a doctor.",

            "answer": "Have you seen a nuerologist?\u00a0\u00a0I'm a nurse and this sounds very serious. I cannot believe you haven't been referred to a heart specialist or a neurologist.Please seek one. Even an ear nose and throat doctor might be the answer. Make sure you give them every symptom every time you visit. It could be a blockage in your sinus which is easy to correct or something more serious with your heart or brain or arteries.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Thyroid, adrenals, testosterone level, parathyroid gland function, diabetes, Vit D, Vit B12, and muscle enzymes should be tested to find the cause. Chronic fatigue syndrome, sleep disorders, fibromyalgia, liver and kidney disorders too could be the cause.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
