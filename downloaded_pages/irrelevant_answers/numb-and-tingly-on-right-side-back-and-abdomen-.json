    "question": "I started having back pain on the right side which progressed slowly (within a week) to my side and abdomen.\u00a0\u00a0The area became very sensitive to the touch and numb and tingly feeling.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the doctors and they diagnosed me with Shingles (I have no rash or itching, and they did not confirm with blood work or anything).\u00a0\u00a0They put me on an anti viral medication for 1 week and in that time the sensations has progressed down my right leg as well. It often feels like a wave of warm water is rushing through that part of my body. Like I have (BenGay) rubbed on there. I have had a bloated stomach and some diarhea but do not know if these symptoms are related to this or not.\u00a0\u00a0Also, my rib cage and hip on that side feel very sore.\u00a0\u00a0Like I have been beaten up.\u00a0\u00a0Are all of these symtoms normal for shingles?\u00a0\u00a0I have no rash or severe pain like I keep hearing about.\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned that it might be something else.\u00a0\u00a0I have had gestational diabetes in my past two pregnancies and have been told I am at high risk for type 2 diabetes (my father had it) I have gained about 10 pounds in the last month. I feel tired and sluggish sometimes to the point were I can't keep my eyes open at work.\u00a0\u00a0I have to get up and go for a walk to wake myself up. -any ideas or suggestions?",
