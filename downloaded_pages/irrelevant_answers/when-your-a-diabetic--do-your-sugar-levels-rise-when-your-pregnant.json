            "answer": "I must have missed where you wrote the high sugar levels? I can't seem to find that. Hmmm....anyway I don't know that, that would be a significant probability of pregnancy however, if they are over 200 thats nothing to let go, you need to have it addressed asap. I do know that diabetes can be a problem when you are pregnant but I can't say I ever heard that those symptoms point to pregnancy. I agree...try the over the counter pregnancy test if you have missed your cycle.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
