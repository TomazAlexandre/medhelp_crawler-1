Have to check my sugar 4 times a day and it's always over what it should be. I changed my diet and only drink water and been counting my carbs as best I can. Next step for me is the insulin pill. Find out next week if they are going to put me on it.\u00a0\u00a0Just want my baby and me to be ok.\u00a0\u00a0Can't remember my numbers for the test but if you didn't pass you should find out that day. Good luck to you!",
