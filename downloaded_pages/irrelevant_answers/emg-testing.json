            "answer": "Diabetes can cause both peripheral vascualar disease and a peripheral neuropathy (damage to nerves)You most likely have both, as the symptoms you describe are more suggestive of neuropathy than vascular insuffieciency (although the vascular issues may be contributing)A good test is an EMG needle study and nerve conduction studies to evaluate for a problem with the nerves. The diagnosis is also clinical though and you should see a good neurologist for a neurological examination. Treatment is based on good sugar control and nerve pain medications for neuropathy like neurontin, amitryptaline, and pregabalin. Other causes of neuropathy are less likely but can be ruled out by simple blood test eg vitamin deficiency, underactive thyroid etcGood luck",
