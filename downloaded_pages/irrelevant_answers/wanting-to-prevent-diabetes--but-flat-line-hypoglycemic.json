            "answer": "Sorry, I don't get your post. Are you asking for help with diabetes or with weight loss? Not quite sure how to answer you but I'll give it a whirl. Hope others come along with ideas too.Reactive hypoglycemia is when glucose [blood sugar] drops after meals. This is not classified as diabetes. So I'm not quite sure if you're a type 1 diabetic or not. Google it, it may be you, it may not. If you feel you are there is a strict diet one must adhere to. You might try posting on the type 1 forum to see if others have experienced what you're going through.If I were in your shoes I would see/speak with an Endocrinologist [diabetes specialist] along with a Nutritionist/Dietitian. The former to get properly tested and diagnosed, the latter for guidance on proper nutrition. Your after meal tiredness [guessing on my part] could stem from eating too much fruit causing a sugar crash. Good luck",

            "answer": "Hi and thanks for your reply.First, I'm definitely NOT a type 1 diabetic. Thankfully that was not my lot.My concern is regarding type 2 diabetes, and preventing its development, as well as weight loss, since this is by far my biggest risk factor, I believe. I'm overweight (borderline obese), and trying to lose weight. But I have a few questions, and wanted to air them out in hopes maybe I could discuss them with someone. Here are some of my questions:- I've read that flat-line hypoglycemia is not really considered hypoglycemia, but that it's a pre-diabetic condition. Is this truly the case?- Also, I'm wondering about diet. I know there's a lot here about low-carbing, but I've also read a lot about vegan diets helping prevent diabetes. Do you happen to have any information on that, maybe recommendations for someone who wants to be a vegan, but who also wants to lose weight and prevent diabetes? Or should someone in my position, with demonstrated flatline hypoglycemia, instead go the low-carb route?- Does this sound like a sugar-related reaction: \"I find myself feeling somewhat tired after meals (not mentally or even sluggish, but my eyes get \"dry\", as if I should be going to bed. This happens anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour after a meal, despite my body wanting to get up and go running).\"Unfortunately, dietitians are very few and far between in my podunk little area of the country, so that's out of the question.\u00a0\u00a0Silly though it may be, I think I just wanted to chat with someone who I don't have to make an appointment with about this before making an appointment with an endocrinologist.",

            "answer": "I understand your concern about getting diabetes and am glad you are asking questions beforehand. No one on any health forum can diagnose your over the iNet. Speculating about this and that leads nowhere too. Bottom line, nothing can take the place of proper testing, evaluation and diagnosis at a doctor's office.Flat line hypoglycemia - Can be both too little insulin production or too much insulin production, or both. It appears you were informed of this but no further testing were carried out to determine the root cause. As suggested earlier, go see an Endo. not only for diabetes retesting but also the following:1. Thyroid - a malfunctioning thyroid not only disrupts your pancreas but also may affect your endocrine system as well2. Pancreas - C-Peptide test measures how much insulin your pancreas produces. In your case, it may be too much.3. Insulin test - measures how insulin in your blood is produced by the body. Goes hand-in-hand with c-peptide.Read up on Reactive HypoglycemiaRead up on the GI [glycemic Index]Read up on good complex carbs vs bad simple carbsCall and make an appointment with an Endo.",

    "question": "I'm a 31 year old Hispanic male. Current weight 232lbs, (height = 6'1) with most of it concentrated around my waist. Still, this is also the lowest I've been since I was 13. About a year ago I had a GTT done which revealed me to be a flat-line hypoglycemic. (Fasting = 79, 1/2hr = 81, 1hr = 71, 2hr =79) I have a very strong family history of diabetes and am working to prevent it in myself At least, that's what I hope.Currently I:- walk/run (4mph+, usually on an incline of 2-10 degrees) between 15 and 40 miles per week- am a mostly vegan and try to avoid refined sugars of any sort. I do eat sashimi once every few weeks.- My diet's content is around 12% fat (most of it coming from things like flax (omega 3's) and nuts), 13% protein (beans, quinoa, and soy), and 75% carbs (>50g fiber per day).Of course, my sugar intake tends to be high, mostly due to a high intake of fruits (usually berries or bananas, but often also peaches, apples, and pears).While the switch to a vegan diet has helped in many ways (I'm more clear headed, I'm more relaxed, have lost weight and feel very good most of the time), I find myself feeling somewhat tired after meals (not mentally or even sluggish, but my eyes get \"dry\", as if I should be going to bed. This happens anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour after a meal, despite my body wanting to get up and go running). I keep thinking this might be a warning sign that I'm NOT doing it right, despite the studies which show that those who follow a low-fat vegan diet develop diabetes at 1/2 the rate of those who don't, and despite the results of a Pritikin-style diet, which I currently follow.Can anyone offer any advice? I'm working on losing weight, and would even sacrifice my veganism (temporarily) for its sake, since I'm definitely an \"Apple\", and must lose the weight around my waist.\u00a0\u00a0(More info on this thread in the Weight Loss forum:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Weight-Loss--Dieting/Advice-needed-on-a-weight-loss-strategy/show/1472876-- basically it's a thread wherein I ask about a possible strategy, plus offer some more background info)Current stats:=========Weight: 232lbsHeight: 6'1Sex: MaleBackground: HispanicFasting blood sugar: 79 (GTT showed no rise above 81, and a drop to 71 after 1 hour, before normalization). last blood glucose test was about 9 months ago and showed blood sugar level of about 80).Triglycerides: 50Cholesterol: 113 total (HDL 42, LDL 65) (This was pre-vegan. Increasing anxiety for a short time was a sign that the total cholesterol was dropping, likely the LDL)Medical history:-> Right Bundle Branch Block (idiopathic; no other sights of heart disease)-> Gastroparesis (idiopathic, intermittent now)-> GERD (which gets worse with increasing weight)-> No gallbladder (removed in 2009)Thank you.",
