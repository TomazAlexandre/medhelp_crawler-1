    "question": "Water broke at 1:30am July 12. Got to hospital around 3. Labor did not progress like we were hoping for. I didn't dilate pass 5cm...we tried any and everything...i got potocin at 445 AM...they went as high on the dosage as possible which is \u2020o 40, finally at 8 our doctor made the call to do a c section. I couldn't hold on anymore, I was so exhausted. We have a beautiful baby girl weighing 10lbs 3oz, no way she was coming the natural way. I was scared BC I've never had any type of surgery before, I am sore but am managing... Our daughter had to spend the night in the NICU due to low blood sugar, just for observation...can't wait to go see her!!",
