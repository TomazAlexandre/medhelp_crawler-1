            "answer": "Hello,If there is any redness of the skin along with the burning sensation then irritant contact dermatitis has to be ruled out.But if there is no change in the color or texture of skin then other possibilities have to be ruled out.Such symptoms are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the burning sensation is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a physician as it can be due to peripheral vascular disease or neuropathy.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
