            "answer": "Hello,there are no such thing as essential carbs, but there are such thing as essential fats and proteins.However, some foods with carbs also contain vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients.If you want to go low carb, this is fine and can be very effective, but you should still eat plenty of non-starchy vegetables (basically everything execpt corn and potato is ok, and particularly the green veges).No need for fruits (nonstarchy veges contain all the same nutrients as fruit), and grains and sweetened foods.I would highly recommend the book \"Diabetes Solutions\" by Dr. Richard Berstein.\u00a0\u00a0He recommends a diet of about 30 g of carbs/day and also gives excellent advice on managing diabetes.Congratulations on getting healthy!\u00a0\u00a0Keep up the good work.",
