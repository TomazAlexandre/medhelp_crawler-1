            "answer": "First thing first, what are you doing to control and manage your diabetes?* Are you following a diabetic diet?* Is your body weight normal for your height?* Is your BMI index in the normal range?* Do you perform daily 30 minute physical exercise/s?You must adhere to all the above or your glucose will get out of control. Your elevated A1c [HbA1c] indicates you are not practicing one or more of the above, the next step being put on insulin.Tests briefly explained:C-Peptide tests the amount of natural insulin you still makeGAD-65 is a type of antibodies our bodies produce when our immune system is attacking our Beta insulin producing cells.If your GAD-65 results are positive read up on LADA [Latent Autoimmune Disease in Adults]. Usually C-Peptide and GAD-65 are ordered if LADA is suspected. Since every lab, and especially a lab in India, differ in their test result ranges we cannot comment further on your posted results. Hopefully your lab copy provides low - high ranges which you can discuss with your doctor/s. Good luck.",
