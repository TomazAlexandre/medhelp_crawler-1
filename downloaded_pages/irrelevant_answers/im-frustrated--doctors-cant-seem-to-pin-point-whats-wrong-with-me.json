            "answer": "Hello - thanks for asking your question.You describinng right testicular pain, frequent urination, and lower stomach pain.\u00a0\u00a0Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis, scrotal ultrasound negative, CT scan showed diverticulosis.A hernia is possible, but if 2 doctors checked for this and found nothing, then it is unlikely.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot comment further on the possibility of hernia without examining you myself.One option may be prostatitis.\u00a0\u00a0Chronic prostatitis can present with lower abdominal pain and urinary frequency.\u00a0\u00a0Prostatitis can present with or without inflammation.\u00a0\u00a0To diagnose this, a prostatic massage needs to be performed.\u00a0\u00a0Urine tests and cultures of both the urine and prostatic secretions before and after massage is used to diagnose this.\u00a0\u00a0If the diagnosis of prostatis is made, then antibiotics are typically prescribed for 4-12 weeks (i.e. the 2 week course you took would not be sufficient).You may want to discuss this option with your urologist.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Thanks,Kevin, M.D.",

As you see Doctors do a good job of\u00a0\u00a0denying the illness . the condition is endemic They will probably recognise it when someone puts the cure in the book .",

            "answer": "I hate to be the bearer of bad news, Paj, but Candida infection is already in the books, including skin, esophageal, foreskin, and intestinal.\u00a0\u00a0Thing is, you're not likely to have intestinal candida infection unless you have diabetes, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, chronic illness, or immunocompromization.In the case of broad spectrum antibiotics, the Candida goes away when antibiotic therapy is discontinued.\u00a0\u00a0In the case of diabetes, it goes away when the diabetes is managed.\u00a0\u00a0Antifungal therapy for intestinal candida infection is generally unneeded unless the patient is immunocompromised.\u00a0\u00a0This includes but it not limited to:*certain oral steriods (this includes athsma inhalers)*debilitating illness*congestive heart failure*AIDS*immunosuppressants in the case of those with organ transplants*radiation or chemotherapyInfection of the penis glans and underside of the foreskin in uncircumsized males is also possible, but only occurs as a result of intercourse with partner who has a vaginal candida infection, or possibly by recieving oral sex from a partner with an oral infection.Diaper rash can also be caused by candida infection.\u00a0\u00a0For infections involving the skin or vagina, over-the-counter topical treatments are generally more than enough to eradicate the overgrowth in healthy individuals.",

In the case of diabetes, it goes away when the diabetes is managed.Where do you get these gems?When I express an opinion it comes from experience and three years of research, in those years I have exchanged views with many doctors and have been privy to the health issues and progress of many sufferers.Where do you come from? what are your credentials ? what are your references both personally & from medical science for your argument . Give me an argument backed up with facts!!! Not meaningless opinions!!!",

    "question": "I am a 51 year old male in relatively good health except for the listed problem below. In late October of 2002 I began to have pain in my right testical and frequent urination. I went to the doctors and he said I had a bacteria infection and I took Cipro for 2 weeks and it almost went away. but in a couple of weeks I found myself back at the doctors and this time I was having pain in my lower stomic also. I asked for more antibiotics (Cipro) and this time the infection in the right testical went away and the varicous vains in the right testical left as well and no more frequent urination. A urin and blood test were both done. I also\u00a0\u00a0had an ultra sound of the testical which showed nothing. Now the pain in my lower stomic was getting worse. I went back to the doctors and he examined me and recomended I get a Cat scan which I did and this showed diverticulous so I had a colonoscopy done also which varified 4 pockets in the large intestine. So I have Diverticulous but they don't think this is why I have the pain, and it is getting worse too. When I cough I can feel something moving like if you were to squeez a water balloon and the water went from one side to the other and the pain is not real bad mostly a discomfort type of feeling. I asked the doctor if this could be a hernia and both doctors checked for that and found no sigh of a hernia. I am courently awaiting urology to call me to make an appointment to be checked out and maybe take a look at my bladder. Do you think I am doing everthing I should about this problem and what do you think about the hernia? Is there anything else I and the doctors should be doing or might what to consider? Thank you very much, Tom.",
