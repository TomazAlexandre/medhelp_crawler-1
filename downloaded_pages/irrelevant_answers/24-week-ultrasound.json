            "answer": "My last ultrasound was four weeks ago, prior to being diagnosed with gestational diabetes. So, they wanted to do another to make sure the baby isn't getting too big. My next ultrasound is in six weeks (at 30 weeks pg), and I'll begin twice-weekly stress tests at that point. I'll have another ultrasound every two weeks after the 30-week mark to monitor the baby's size. OB said that if the baby is getting large, he'll induce me at 37 weeks...which is fine by me. (My son was born at almost 37 weeks and he was 8 lbs 5 oz. And I didn't have GD at that time.)And, Pam...no advice. Except that I'm overweight to begin with, so maybe that's why I don't seem to gain a lot of weight when I'm pregnant. (12 pounds with my daughter, 4 pounds with my son.) You could start out 75 pounds overweight and you'll be all good...lol. I'm sure the gestational diabetes has made a difference, too. I had gained about three pounds, but lost four in the last few weeks after being diagnosed. I'm not necessarily on a *diet...but I am making better choices and limiting food that is high on the glycemic index. It's actually been surprisingly easy!Tricia",

    "question": "Just an update! Had my 24-week ultrasound today, and everything looks perfect! I was concerned about how big he might be getting due to the GD, but his weight is right on track. They said he's 1 pound 12 oz right now. His length was long...measuring at 26 weeks, rather than 24. But, that's okay, as long as he's not fat, too! LOL. Brain and heart and spine are perfect. And...I weigh one pound less than when I got pregnant! :-) So...happy day for me! Can't wait until the little monkey gets here!Tricia",
