ODST is a much more 1:1 type of interaction that starts over a secure website and can grow, depending on the interests/needs of the folks asking for help & information.Good luck to you & your daughter.",

    "question": "I am wondering if there is someone out here who would like to sell a remote for a minimed 722 insulin pump?? My daughter is 13 years old and would like to wear her pump in a discreet area while she is at school. She would like to be able to access her bolus without having to figit under her clothes. I did see them on the MiniMed website but we simply cant afford that remote. Hopefully there is someone here with a kind heart and shallow pockets that might give us a fabulous deal on that remote.\u00a0\u00a0I have already contacted the MiniMed Rep, as well as, the distributor, they have both said that the remote control is an extra cost.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you in advance for your responses.",
