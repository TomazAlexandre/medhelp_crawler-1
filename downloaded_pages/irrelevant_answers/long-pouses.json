            "answer": "Question:Patient with diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia is having long asymptomatic pauses in Holter monitoring.Answer:I hope your hypertension, diabetes and cholesterol are well regulated. That's the most important factors to maintain good cardiac health. We are not doctors and can't advice further plan of action.Regarding the pauses; your cardiologist must evaluate how long they are, when they occur, and what the most likely explaination for them is. Some pauses are normal, but at daytime they should not be longer than 2,7 seconds. At night they should not be longer than 3 seconds, unless with atrial fibrillation, where pauses are normal as long as they don't cause symptoms.Pauses often indicate sinus node dysfunction or in some cases overdosage / side effects of beta blockers and/or calcium channel blockers. They both suppress sinus node function and conduction time in the heart.You don't mention how long the pauses are and how frequent they are. I would advice you to contact your cardiologist.",
