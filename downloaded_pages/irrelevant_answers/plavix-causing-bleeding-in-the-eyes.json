            "answer": "Hello Lundy,I'm also not a doc and agree that slow healing should be dicussed with your dad's doc.\u00a0\u00a0I can see where you might be concerned that any drug that'll help blood flow more easily thru one's vascular system might make for more bleeding in one's eyes.In general, folks with diabetes heal slowly if our blood sugars are not well-controlled; the \"catch 22\" seems to be that illness and other stressors make it harder for us to hvae good blood sugar control even when we're trying to do the right things.I hope your dad's retinopathy stabilizes.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it takes a while, tho' and anything you can do to encourage him will help the emotional & stress side of all this.I wish good luck to you both.",
