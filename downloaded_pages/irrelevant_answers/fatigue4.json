            "answer": "Hi!Extreme fatigue could be due to menopause/hormonal imbalance of PCOD, anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems. Another possibility is sleep disturbances (like sleep apnea, imbalance of rapid eye and non rapid eye movement sleep etc.). You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, low Vit B12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium. Hyperthyroidism too causes increased sweating and tiredness.\u00a0\u00a0 Postviral fatigue syndrome is another possibility. Persisting EBV infection or mono can also be the cause. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

            "answer": "I would say to start with the basics, try eating right, taking supplements increasing water intake, and exercising. Even if you're too tired now to exercise, get your butt up and start just five minutes...everytime you think of it. If that doesn't help after a couple weeks Then start up some lab work. Also note to yourself and your dr if ibuprofen seems to help you feel better all around.",
