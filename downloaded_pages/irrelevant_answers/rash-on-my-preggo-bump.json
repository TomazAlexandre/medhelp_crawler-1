            "answer": "No no I remember watching \"Pregnancy For Dummies\" on tv once where all they play all day is **** like babies: special delivery n stuff like that for new or expecting mommies.But anyways, I remember them saying that something about a rash that some women get. Like a bumpy, or an eczema-looking rash on different parts of their bodies.And the only cure for it is delivery.There's alot of stuff we gatta watch out for cuz the only cure for some of these things are delivery so if you get it early, you gatta deal with it till the baby comes.Ugh.Like pregnancy induced diabetes, n that rash you're experiencing... n all these other things like increased blood pressure...But if it is that rash I remember them saying, then no it's not harmful to your baby because he/she caused it along with your hormones.lol.But I would mention it to your doctor just incase.",
