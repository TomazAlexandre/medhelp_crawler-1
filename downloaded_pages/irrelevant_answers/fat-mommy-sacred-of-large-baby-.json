            "answer": "Being big doesn't mean you'll have a big baby. Most of the women in my family are tiny and still do. My mother is 5'2\" and was barely 100 lbs when wet... popped out 5 kids.. each of us 10-12 lbs each and she did it naturally. In our area 8-9 lb babies are normal and we don't consider them large until they reach 10lbs or more. My husbands family is all large women who have tiny babies at 6lbs or less... you may have a large child if your blood sugar stays high or if you end up on insulin (that stuff is steroids for babies) but as long as you keep it stable you probably won't have a problem.",

    "question": "Before I became pregnant I had already put on a lot of weight, I was 250. Now at 33 weeks I'm almost 300 lbs but I don't look it. I don't even look pregant. I'm 5'8 and have a weird body shape where I'm small up top and large on the bottom. Besides me gaining so much weight im healthy; no high blood pressure/ diabetes or anything of that sort. I'm determined to loose the weight once my baby is here (don't like being fat) but I'm afraid that my son will be more than 8lbs.. can any heavy mom's share some in sight on this?",
