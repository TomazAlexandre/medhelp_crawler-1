            "answer": "I've never heard of that before, but I wish you the best. If I were you, I would google and search online your symptoms to see if you can find some conditions that cause what you are experiencing. That way, the next time you go to the doctor you can ask them to test you for this, this, and this. It stinks, but sometimes you have to search for your own answers before a doctor will be able to help you!",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!A pain of this type could be due to peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or hypothyroidism. It could also be a pinched nerve at cervical spine, shoulder or elbow joint. Hence a nerve conduction study should be done. Possibility of deep vein thrombisis should be ruled out by a duplex ultrasound of arm. You had a MRI-probably cervical spine, so this cause is ruled out.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 28 year old female.. For the past 2 years, on and off...I get this weird pain in my upper left arm...most times it feels like a tight muscle or pinch or squeeze, sometimes I get a burning sensation or tingling, but I basically always feel it.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't 'hurt', but it is very uncomfortable and bothersome...I always think there is something majorly wrong with me, and overthinking the arm pain gives me anxiety!\u00a0\u00a0And that doesn't help, cause then I feel it more!\u00a0\u00a0It's a vicious cycle.\u00a0\u00a0When I first felt the pain, my doc sent me for MRI's and EKG's, but all the tests came out fine...I'm confused as to the cause, and paranoid as to what is really going on with my arm...anyone else experiencing this?\u00a0\u00a0Please give me your insight",
