            "answer": "I can understand your frustration especially since you're doing all the right things to control your glucose levels. You may wish to have your pancreas checked to see why its not producing the needed insulin. If your pancreas checks out OK, the next gland to check is your thyroid. Thyroid disorders have been known to disrupt the pancreas. From there its your immune system.Good luck.",
