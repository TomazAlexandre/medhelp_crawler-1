            "answer": "That very well could be the case. The disease is nonlinear so you the problem is we don't know if it will suddenly decide to progress at a faster rate even if you don't drink and take good care of yourself.\u00a0\u00a0You are at higher risk for other diseases than a Hep C negative person, diabetes and lymphoma are two that come to mind but there are a number of others too. It's a tough decision I know.Here is some info. towards the lower half of the page there is a chart that shows progression to cirrhosis in years basedliver damage level and other info. that might be helpful. I'd also go to clinicaloptions.com and view the videos there that talk about progression and the treat or not treat dilemma. It is free and super informative but you do have to register. Well worth it.http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/443005_7",

    "question": "While I await my biopsy results, I have a question.Due to my now X-wife having sex all over the place, I had a full examination 3 years ago. I was checked for HCV as well as all other things known. I gave blood and no flags went up either. This indicates I may have not had the virus very long at all. Hopefully the results from a recent biopsy will support this theory.Anyway, I came up with HCV Type-2A, VL of 750k and treated for 24 weeks, undetectable at 10 and 24 weeks but relapsed at the 6 month test with a VL of 460k. I was then referred to Dr. Gitlin.In my short talks with Dr. Gitlin, it was said that it is not uncommon for folks with the virus and no detectable liver damage to not treat, but keep monitored. He no way shape or form let me think this was my prognosis or his common practice. I was just trying to get as many questions in as possible and he replied to some of them in short fashion. He did not want to speak much about\u00a0\u00a0anything untill my blood work and biopsy results were in his hands. and I fully agree with him. No talk too soon until all the facts are in.I am 52 years old. If I have no liver damage, why should I treat again? As slow as the virus takes to damage the liver, it would seem that I would have died of old age or lightning strik before it would kill my liver?Please comment.",
