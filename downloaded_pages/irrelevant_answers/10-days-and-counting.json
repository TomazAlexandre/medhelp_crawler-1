            "answer": "Stress could cause your periods to be late or not at all.\u00a0\u00a0bruising could and I am not saying it is but could be a sign of diabetes, any family history??\u00a0\u00a0 I can't say about the cramps, but you really need to get sleep I know it is hard when you are extremely scared, trust me been there and done that.I would ask your doctor to run some test, like thyroid and diabetes and see if it is something that can be diagnosed, you shouldn't have to go on like this.good luck and I REALLY hope they can get to the bottom of thisMichelle",

    "question": "Hello and Thanks in advance for your response... I am a 21 year old, and have been late for my period for 10 days now. Thats irregular for me,when I am late its usually for 2-4 days,never more. Im under decent ammounts of stress lately, I cant sleep at night, up till 5 AM at times and wake up at 1-2 PM then come 7 PM I sleep for a bit. I have cramping as usual and back/chest pains.Breats are sore, headaches now and then,and irregular heart beats(fast) for a few seconds.Also something that usually happens to me I dont know why, I get these unusual brusings around my body. Happens alot,around the time of my period or not, it happens. I went to the doctors for this, and she said it was normal. But told me to take vitamins,which made it worse I think, because my hair started to get thinner! and still is getting thinner when even though I stopped taking them. FOOD!! something I THOUGHT I LOVED! but now i cant stand eating anymore,when I do, i just never finish my plate, my apetite is just not there anymore. Im 4'11 and weigh 115-118 thats normal for me. ANY RESPONSE please..",
