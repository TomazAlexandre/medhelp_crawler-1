            "answer": "Hello poohcarr,I agree that you should see a cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0Studies show that patients get better cardiac care from a cardiologist compared to GPs.\u00a0\u00a0Is it safe for me to assume he is on other medications besides just lasix?You husband has several risk factors for coronary diseasediabetes,high blood pressurecholesterolfamily historyI assume he doesn't smoke.This is someone that I would aggressively manage risk factors and would have on several medications that are proven to decrease cardiac events and mortality.aspirinstatinprobably a beta blocker and possibly an ACE inhibitorI am not sure how to interpret the report you mentioned above.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure if left ventricular enlargement means chamber enlargment, post stress dilation, or left ventricular hypertrophy.\u00a0\u00a0I think your best bet is to see a specialist.good luck and thanks for posting!",

    "question": "Hello,my husband whom is 48 years old and a strong family history of heart disease(father died at 52,brother at 47 ,3 aunts also died early of massive heart attacks) had an abnormal ekg in office visit.They sent him for a cardiolite stress test.The test showed mild left ventricular enlargement,thinning of radiotracer uptake in the inferior wall.the left ventricular ejection fraction is estimated at 50%.He has high blood pressure,high cholestrol,diabetes,and takes 80 mg of lasix 2x a day.The doctor told him that they would monitor him but we are still very concerned.Can you tell us what the test showed exactly,should he be seeing a heart doctor? Thank you!",
