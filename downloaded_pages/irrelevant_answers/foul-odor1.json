            "answer": "hello. according to online resources, the odor could be caused by several things. the most serious being liver or kidney failure. when these organs are damaged, the processes by which they remove toxins can be affected, resulting in a buildup of these toxins which in turn cause the odor. although elevated liver panels can indicate problems, the most accurate method of determining damage is a biopsy (taking a small sample of liver tissue) which can give a much better indication than blood tests alone. more importantly, the drinking you described will almost certainly cause major life threatening conditions if it has not already done so, and any damage done will not be effectively treated as long as the alcohol consumption continues. an alcoholic death is a horrible way to go, and there are resources available that can help such as aa and\u00a0\u00a0medical treatment. i know because i drank the same way for many years, and was able to get sober by reaching out for the help available to me. best wishes, gm",
