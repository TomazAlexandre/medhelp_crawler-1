            "answer": "That sounds very similar to what I suffered.\u00a0\u00a0Like urself if I missed a meal I would become very weak and shaky. I was tested for Diabetes but was ok.\u00a0\u00a0Doc said it was stress but when I hired a Nutritionist she found that my meals and snacks were low in Protein and high in Carbs.\u00a0\u00a0It was only when I started having a high Protein diet that my stress levels dropped and the shakiness has subsided.Eating protein rich foods such as eggs, meat, fish, milk, cheece, yogurt, nuts, pulses and legemes will help u feel more stable.Even between meals don't go for a chocolate bar as that is mainly carbs, instead have a yogurt or cheece, tuna, egg samwiche...Eggs are very high in protein and so are perfect if ur having a shaky moment, boiled is better.Give this a try and I think in a week or less u'll feel stronger.",

            "answer": "P.s forgot to mention that another reason for the shakiness could be that ur adrenals glands might be exhausted. In times of extreme stress the adrenals are over worked and become depleted, which can cause extreme fatigue, anxiety, shakiness.\u00a0\u00a0Increasing ur level of Zinc and vitamin B6 will help.\u00a0\u00a0Although it would probably be best to take a high strength muti-vitamin\\mineral. That way u'll cover any vitamin\\mineral that may be low.If after a few weeks things don't start getting better u should go back and ask for a full blood check up, to check for thyroid, Diabetes, kidney, liver issues....",
