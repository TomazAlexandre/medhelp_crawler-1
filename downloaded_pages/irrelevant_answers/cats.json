            "answer": "alien makes some good points.....I'd also like to add it sounds to me like she is simply hungry. ...she is getting quantity NOT quality food and perhaps lacking in the nutrition she needs especially for a senior cat.Iams is not a good food dear, can foods are a must...but find some with NO grains and NO meat by-products, you will notice a huge difference in the quantity kitty wants and how much more satisfied she will be...the better cat foods do cost more however I find they don't eat nearly as much when they are satisfied.try Wellness, Core, EVO, Merrick or Tiki(avail at petco)these are a few of the best...good luck\u2665Opus",

    "question": "I have a home with multiple cats ranging from 1 1/2 years to 12 years old.\u00a0\u00a0My 12 year old cat Sassy was at one point the cat that 'scrammed' when strangers came to the home.\u00a0\u00a0After I got the two youngest cats last year she would hardly ever come out of her sleeping area.\u00a0\u00a0I had to coax her with canned food.\u00a0\u00a0She lost weight and I took her to the vet and was treated for urinary tract infection.\u00a0\u00a0Ever since that time she is now the most aggressive of all the cats (as I come in the house, she is waiting there MEOWING at the top of her lungs).\u00a0\u00a0She no long hides, she appears to be always hungry and her preference is canned food and IAMS hairball dry food, she is thin, but still very active, jumping, chasing things and will nip you if you don't pet her when she wants.\u00a0\u00a0I called the vet and the tech told me that it's possible she is demanding food because she is afraid of the other cats trying to eat her food.\u00a0\u00a0I feed her separate from the other cats, as I don't feed them canned food.\u00a0\u00a0 Is there something wrong with my cat?Thanks, Roberta",
