            "answer": "You have developed diabetic neuropathy, and from here on in have to take special care of your feet. Wear comfortably loosely fitting shoes and only fresh white socks. Never wear socks more than a day.\u00a0\u00a0Inspect your feet daily and have the toenails trimmed by a podiatrist. Immediately see a podiatrist at the slightest infection. And see a podiatrist regularly, in any event. 1000 mg of omega-3 fish oils and a slow-release niacin tablet once a day will help with microcirculation. Take special care to insure your hba1c is within normal limits. Alpha-lipoic acid supplements have been anecdotally recommended to assist in stopping nerve damage. From the standpoint of the literature, the jury is out.",
