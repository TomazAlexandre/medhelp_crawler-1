ThanksOct 2010Impression:Scattered small nonspecific T2 hyperintense foci in the periventricuar white matter and centrum semiovale. These areas are devoid of surrounding mass effect, enhancement, or restricted diffusion. In the appropriate clinical setting of hypertension or diabetes these meaty are squeal of small vessel ischemia. Other differential considerations include sequel of prior trauma or infection such as Lyme disease. Vasculitides to include white matter changes associated with migraine headaches. A demyelinating process cannot be completely excluded based on this appearance.May 2011Impression1. Nonspecific hemispheric leukoencephalopathy. In addition mildy confluent abnormal T2 signal is present in the temporal subcortical white matter on each side. Differential includes a demyelinating condition such as multiple sclerosis,vasculitis, and less likely migraines or early manifestation of chronic small vessel disease. Given the presence of confluence signal in the temporal subcortical white matter, CADASIL (cerebral autosomal domnant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) is aslo in the differental.3. Stable bright T1 signal in the globus pallidus with early changes in the dentate nuclei and accompanying increased susceptiblilty on greadient images, also involving the lateral margins of the caudent nuclei. Differential includes liver disease, parenteral nutrution (TPN), early manifestation of age related mineralization ( normally occurs in patients greater than 30 years of age) or endocrine disorser such as hypothyroidsim and hyperpaarthyoidism4. Moderate to severe nonspecific right mastiod air cell opacification with mild to moderate changes in the left mastoid air cells. Boderline sized right retropharyngeal lymph nodes measuring 6 mm in short axis dimension.The findings in the right side mastiod air cells has worsen since the prior exam",
