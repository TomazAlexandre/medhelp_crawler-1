            "answer": "I have suffered from psychotic major depression for 9 years now. Taken a lot of meds, also gained 100lbs, total weight gain of 130lbs from start to now. Anyway I now might have diabetes from the ZYPREXA that caused the last 60lb gain. I am really afraid of starting the Geodon and making the switch. I usually end up in the hospital, this time I am afraid of what will take place. My question is, can someone suffer from PMD for 9 years or do u think that the diagnosis must be wrong? Also I am having trouble at work as I cannot concentrate and I am making stupid errors from all the paperwork. Do people with this type of illness usually end up on disability?",

    "question": "17 years ago, mt mother started to hear voices and she had anxiety attacks, and deep depression. In the first few years of her illness, she spent weeks in psychiatric hospitals at a time. She called the paramedics to our home many times. She had her good days, but her life became captivated with her illness. Doctors perscribed medication after medication until one day they found one that controlled her anxiety and depression. Although the side effects were great. Over the last ten years, she gained 150 lbs. She developed Insomnia, has high blood pressure, and recently the doctor told her she might have diabetes- she'll know for sure after an appointment tomorrow. Since a child, she's always eated extremely healthy and she raised my brother and I very healthy also. She never eats white flour, white rice, processed sugar, red meat, soda, milk, fried foods, fast food ect. NEVER! My mother and father have enjoyed a diet of salads everyday, fresh fruit, tofu, chicken, fish and whole grains for the past 25 years! All that just to say her health prolems are not a result of her diet by any means. My mother exercises as much as possible, but often one leg will go numb, or she just to tierd. Everytime she tells her doctor she has a problem, she gets another medication. a lot of her meds are to treat side effects of other meds. Meds mother is on: blood pressure- diovan, norvas, Triamterine AZTZ; Psychiatric-zyprexa, clonipin, geodon, trazadone; Sleep- sonata. She also takes two herbal supplements- somatrol, sound sleep. I am worried for her life. I positive if we were a wealthy family, we could find alternitive healthcare for my mother. But, we're not, however we are concered and involved in her life. If there was some way her body could be de-toxed and she could be admitted to a facility where they will monitor and treat the root of her illness, maybe she could get her life back after all these years. This message is sent out in urjency to anyone who has an inkling of an idea. HELP!! My mother and father live in Philadelphia. I live in Los Angeles. 310-967-3953 or ***@****. Thank you.",
