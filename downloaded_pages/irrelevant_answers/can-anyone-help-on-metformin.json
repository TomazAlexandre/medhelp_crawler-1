            "answer": "Well metformin helps in stimulating your ovaries... its really for diabetes but studies have shown that it stimulates your ovaries which means it gives you nice healthy eggs, a lot of the times it is good to take it with clomid but i would deff talk to you dr. about it again so he can explain it better. If you feel he is always rushing you then i would get a diff Dr. Dr's usually don't rush.. but good luck!!!",
