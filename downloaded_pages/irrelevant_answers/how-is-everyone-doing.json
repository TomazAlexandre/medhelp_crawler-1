            "answer": "I hope all goes well at your ultrasound and your little one cooperates so you can find out the gender! :0)Other than being very tired all the time, all is going well with this pregnancy. Thankfully, the complications I have had in my previous pregnancies have not been a problem with this one so far. I had a small concern at 17wks due to the placenta being too close to my cervix, but latest u/s shows it is moving up and out of the way. I have another glucose test tomorrow, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that all goes well (I had gestational diabetes with my other two).",
