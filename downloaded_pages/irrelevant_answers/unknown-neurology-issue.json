My worry that while I waste time going to doctors that can't help, whatever is wrong with me could be getting worse. I have an appointment tomorrow. I guess depending on what he tells me I will make an appointment with an allergist. At this point I just want to know what is wrong with me. The not knowing is making me crazy.",

    "question": "I have been having a tight skin sensation in my arms and legs. At times it feels like a tingling sensation. It comes and goes for no reason. I have had blood work to rule out lupus, celiacs, diabetes and rheumatoid issues. The doctor also said my symptoms were to symmetrical to be ms. Now she's trying to tell me its an allergic reaction to something but I'm not convinced. I don't know what to do at this point since the doctor isn't much help. I'm worried that its something bad but I feel like the doctor doesn't know and is no longer willing to help me.",
