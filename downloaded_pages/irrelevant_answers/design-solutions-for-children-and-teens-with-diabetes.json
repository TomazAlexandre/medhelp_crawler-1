            "answer": "Josh, what a wonderful idea for a design. I wish you the best in this project.As for my opinion, one of the worst challenges is for the child to take time out from his or her busy schedule to test and take insulin or bolus a pump. Another big issue is making sure that the child has something sweet such as sports drink or juice or glucose tablets with them at all times in case they get hypoglycemic.Any other suggestions are very welcome here.",

I wanted to pump so bad and now that i have it, i don't like it because it is so big and obvious. I am one of those females that keepp things hidden i guess...i just want to be normal really.

    "question": "Hello,I am looking to design an object/s for youngsters with diabetes to help manage and maintain their health more effectively. First of all, I need to find out firsthand from parents the things that, on a daily basis, create barriers to your child caring for themselves. What are the specific challenges that you and your child face when they are not with you? I would be eternally grateful to anyone who could offer feedback.Good luck!Josh",
