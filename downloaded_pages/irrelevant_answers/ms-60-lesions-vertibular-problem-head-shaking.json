            "answer": "Hi fm64You're in the right place to get support nod to vent if you need. It's hard to tell from what you've said so far as so many different things have the symptoms you describe.Good luck with your appt on Thurs, write down some questions you might want to ask in case you forget at the time, have a list of symptoms and any causes of flare ups as that can be useful for the doc as they put the picture together.I suspect you won't get immediate answers as they'll want/need to do some tests etc to help them see what is going on for you.Let us know what they have to say and I'm sure the medical peeps on the forum will chip in with their opinions - which are usually pretty helpful.Nx",

            "answer": "Hi and welcome,There are numerous non demyelination related conditions that also cause brain lesions, diabetes as far as i'm aware is actually associated with vascular lesions and potentially could be the explanation but you'll have a better idea of what your dealing with after you've seen the neurologist on Thursday. Let us know how you get on...Cheers........JJ",

            "answer": "Hi M -Here are my thoughts on your neuro appointment. Let he/she do the work. They should take a thorough history. I would focus on the top 3-4 symotoms as relates to quality of life. If they want more they should ask. Try not to suggest diagagnoses. They hate that, and you're liable to end up in their \"nut\" group :-)Keep us posted.Kyle",

I have a job that uses my hands and arms and the computer and these things and looking down make the head shaking really bad.\u00a0\u00a0Light duty for now...\u00a0\u00a0Thx",

            "answer": "Your neuro said you're too old for MS? Or am I misunderstanding you? But if that's what was said, I urge you to fire that neuro forthwith and find someone competent. There is no upper age for MS--many people in their 60s and beyond have been diagnosed, and there is good scientific data demonstrating that.I don't at all know that you have MS, but you have enough MS-like symptoms that you should be checked out by a neuro specializing in MS. If you're a reasonably large metro area this shouldn't be too hard. Try your local chapter of the Nat'l MS Society for suggestions. Good luck.ess",

            "answer": "If a neurologist ever says 'too old for MS'...it's time for a new neurologist. I know it can be exhausting to change horses mid-stream, but they just flat-out have their facts wrong. Of course, we can't say if you are dealing with MS or something else, but a statement like that is a huge red flag to me.",
