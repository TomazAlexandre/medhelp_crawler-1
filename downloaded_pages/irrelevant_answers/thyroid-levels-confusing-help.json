            "answer": "Definitely not normal test results.\u00a0\u00a0An Endo is probably a good idea at this time, but not just any Endo.\u00a0\u00a0Many of them specialize in diabetes, not thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0You'd be amazed at the number of horror stories from members who have gone to just any Endo, and been misdiagnosed and treated ineffectively.Rather than waste your time and get frustrated, you need to find a good thyroid doctor who will do the necessary testing and then treat you clinically (for symptoms) by testing and adjusting the actual, biologically active thyroid hormones, FT3 and FT4, with medication as necessary to relieve symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0If you will identify your location, you could get lucky and get a recommendation for a good thyroid doctor from a member with personal experience with the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0 Lacking such a recommendation we can make suggestions for other ways.",

    "question": "I have had some symptoms of hyperthyroid in the past few years. But I have also gained a ton of weight. I got my thyroid test back today. Tsh was .55 and Free T4 was .67. According to the ranges they gave me both levels are on the very low end of normal. So am I normal? I have read online that both of these hormones being low could mean a pituitary problem. Should I ask to be refered to an endocrinologist or should I just accept I'm normal and leave it alone?",
