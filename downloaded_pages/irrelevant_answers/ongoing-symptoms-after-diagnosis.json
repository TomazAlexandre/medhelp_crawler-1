            "answer": "\"Thanks. I am aware of neuropathic complications but I understood it took years for them to develop, not weeks.\"Those are my thoughts exactly and this is why I believe that you need to talk to your endocrinologist about ANY symptoms you are experiencing outside of what would be considered usual symptoms for low and / or high blood sugar.",

            "answer": "Hi Tim,Were you diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes or Type 1?Sometimes diagnosis (especially Type 2) comes after having the underlying condition for a long time and so symptoms have, as you point out, accumulated over time.While it may feel like a \"long time\" sicne diagnosis, you body was stressed for even longer before then and it may take time for your system to return to normal and to FEEL normal.The best goal you can shoot for is normal blood sugars, because it's the elevated blood sugars that lead to most of the complications.\u00a0\u00a0Blood sugars will always have fluctuations thru the day, the week, the month -- tightening up control means lowering the highs (both the number and the duration) and avoiding lows.\u00a0\u00a0We strive for that with frequent testing and learning how our body responds to exercise (short term, long term), foods, illness, stress, etc.Probably you have a followup with your endocrinologist in a couple of months.\u00a0\u00a0That's a good opprotunity to compare how you feel and for your doc to evaluate the need for other specialists to participate in your care.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, if symptoms worsen or if your blood sugar readings are consistently out of your target range, check in much sooner.It's a considerable learning curve, and you can master it.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your comments. I was diagnosed with mody diabetes, my blood sugar levels have been very stable since diagnosis through diet and exercise although they were quite high when I was diagnosed.I've had stable levels for about 6 weeks now and I thought these symptoms might go away sooner than that but I am seeing my doctor next week. It may well be neuro damage from having the condition for a while before diagnosis.Thanks again for your comments.",

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with Diabetes, about 2 months ago. I am a 34 year old male, very fit and do lots of exercise.My blood sugars are controlled via exercise and diet but I am experiencing general feelings of numbness, particularly in both hands and lower arms although also sometimes in my thigh / leg.I get very tired in the afternoon and also get random pins and needles feelings.Is it normal to go through a readjustment period in the first few months following diagnosis, with these sort of symptoms?My blood sugar levels were very high when I was diagnosed.",
