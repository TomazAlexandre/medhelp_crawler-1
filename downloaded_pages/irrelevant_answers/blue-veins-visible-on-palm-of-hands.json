            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Well, it could be Raynaud\u2019s disease. However if you are lean and thin with very less fat in the body and fair skinned, then this could also be a normal finding.Mottled appearance and numbness can be due to clot formation in the veins or faulty valves. Peripheral vascular disease as in diabetes and hypothyroidism too should be ruled out.It is really very difficult to comment what is causing this. Please discuss this with your PCP and get a referral for a vascular specialist.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
