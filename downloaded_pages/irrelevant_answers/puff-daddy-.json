    "question": "Help.My dad is suffering from some kind of disease or allergy that no doctors can identify what it is. He will randomly swell up in different parts of his body, sometimes it is due to irritation ( hiking=foot swelling, tight belt= waist swelling etc) and sometimes it is totally random. He's already had to cut off 2 wedding rings in fear of losing his finger because his hand was so swollen. And today his face swelled up so bad he couldn't see and we had to take him to the ER.Does anyone have any ideal what could be happening or a suggestion for him to try?Please reply.",
