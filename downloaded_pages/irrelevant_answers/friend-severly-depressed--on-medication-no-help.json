            "answer": "To overcome depression takes a combo of the right med and therapy.Sometimes it takes awhaile to get the right med but it is so worth it not to give up.I was on many meds for bi polar before I got on the meds I am on now and I still go to therapy.(6 years now)She also need to eat a balanced diet, exercise,( 30 min\u00a0\u00a0brisk walk will do,Nothing strenuous.) and regular rest in additiontion to the meds and therapy.You are a good friend to wnat to help.You have to have tough love love though and ask does she take her meds consistatnly and does she gets some exercise/stuff lkike that. Many time s a med will start working and then the patient stops taking it( I know for I have done this.) but it is kie diabetes you take your med everyday .Its a small price to pay for feeling yourself and not in the depression.Let me know how it goes for your friend. Maybe you could get her to post here.This is a good place to come especially if you need to talk or vent.My prayers are with you and your friend.Love Venora",
