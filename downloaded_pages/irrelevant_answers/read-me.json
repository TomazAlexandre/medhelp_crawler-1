            "answer": "@Tia2015Congratulations on your pregnancy!When I gave birth to my son (natural) I did three things that I think helped me a lot. The first thing I did was give my nurse and doctor my birth plan. I discussed it with them and explained that I wanted to go natural and would appreciate their support by not throwing drugs at me (but keeping them available if needed) and just helping me stay as comfortable as possible. The second thing I did was give in to the contractions and change positions when needed. Fighting the contractions only makes the pain feel worse and changing positions will help you get more comfortable and in my case it sped up my delivery which was only seven hours long. By being in multiple positions it allowed my baby to drop a lot quicker. Third, have a great support system in the room with you. For me, that was my hubby and nurse. Have them talk to you to keep you distracted or if you prefer quite have them dim the lights and massage your back (helped me a ton). Don't worry sweetie.. your body was made for this and you can do it! Just remember the reason why you're doing it and it will be all worth it. Also, if you feel that you need the epidural than please get it. Good luck hun! And I hope I helped a little :)",

            "answer": "First off, I would like to say congrats on being a mother . It's the greatest blessing I have ever recieved. I am a mother myself. I have a 10& a half month old daughter with another baby on the way. I another currently 7 weeks & 2 days pregnant. I went to the E.R. last Sunday night due to old blood (dark brown) discharge and I thought it was something bad. They told me baby looks fine and that if I'm going to have a miscarriage that there is nothing that I or they can do to stop it. Well last night, I went to the bathroom to pee and as I got off the toilet seat, right before I was going to flush, the water in the toilet was red. Like a light red...I started crying and shaking right away. My husband told me that I have nothing to worry about since every pregnancy is different and that it's probably nothing. He's not that worried about it since we have an ultrasound appointment with my gyno on Tuesday. This morning I woke up with mild cramping on my right ovary I believe. I have no better way of describing it. My question to you is: did you have anything like this occur while you were pregnant? I didn't have any bleeding whatsoever while I was pregnant with my daughter so I'm really freaked out. I hate going to the E.R. because whenever I go, they tell me that the baby is fine at this point and then they just give me a heads up like it could possibly be a threatened miscarriage. I feel like I'm losing my mind. Idk.\u00a0\u00a0I just hope everything is ok with my little baby.",

            "answer": "@Roxxxy915Yes I had gestational diabetes when I was pregnant.I was diagnosed at around 35 weeks. When I got the news I was devastated and (at work) cried my eyes out because I thought I was harming my baby. I met with a dietician and she helped me with a meal plan. I was only allowed a certain amount of carbs per meal and I had to eat three meals and three snacks everyday. I had to check my sugar four times a day as well. If you have it I do recommend that you seek a dietician. Mine helped a lot and I no longer have it. My baby had to get his blood drawn three times once he was born to make sure his sugar was okay and he was perfectly fine. If you're really concerned you can start by not drinking drinks with a lot of sugar. Try not to have fruit and milk in the morning (contains a lot of sugar) and walk at least ten minutes after every meal. Don't be nervous you will be fine! :)",

            "answer": "@Happymama20I did not bleed at all during my pregnancy but I have known women that did. As for the cramping and bleeding at the same time please bring that up to your doctor immediately! I can't tell you wether or not everything is okay because I'm not a doctor unfortunately :( I wish I could comfort you better and give you a better answer. If you don't want to go to the ER maybe try and move your ultrasound appointment up. Good luck to you and your angel! Keep your head up and think positive\u2661",

Congratulations on your pregnancy and I think its great that you talk to women about csections. Pregnant women should really get as much information as possible on both natural and cesarean labor. I was so determined and sure I was going to deliver naturally that I never bothered to even think about having a csection. Emergencies do happen and not everything goes as planned all of the time so thank you for helping others :)!",
