            "answer": "Have you had an antibodies test done yet for Graves or Hashimotos?Asthma and Diabetes as well as Graves Disease and Hashimotos are all Autoimmune Diseases.Usually they say that if you have one autoimmune disease that you can end up with another autoimmune disease.The TSH can be disrupted by many things going on in your body...even the common cold.You need your antibodies tested and your Doctor will recommend whether you are on T4 replacement.Free T3 and Free T4 blood tests are more reliable than the T3 and T4.This shows the amount of T3 and T4 that are not protein bound in your body and are available for use.If your FT3 and FT4 are normal and if you take a T4 replacement med, you are at risk of going Hyper quickly.What does your Doctor say about the Labs?",

            "answer": "A TSH 8.8 with normal free T3 and free T4 and symptoms is called subclinical hypothyroidism. I think you should test for the thyroid antibodies as\u00a0\u00a0Smilerdeb told you. Looks like you have also a metabolic syndrome (high\u00a0\u00a0triglycerides ). You should also do a glucose tolerance test, your sugar levels are very high. Treating hypothyroidism helps with your symptoms and helps to control the sugar levels.",
