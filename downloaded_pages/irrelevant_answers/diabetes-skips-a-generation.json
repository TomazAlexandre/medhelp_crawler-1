            "answer": "I remember hearing that years ago. I have heard every single example of genetics with diabetes of both types from the skipped generation to \"nobody in my family\" to parents, to siblings, etc. I think genetics and diabetes is complex. I absolutely would not be confident that the children won't get diabetes. Type 2 diabetes which previously affected only middle aged people has become much more common in overweight youth. I highly recommend she change her habits, not just for diabetes but for the myriad health problems that are impacted by excessive weight and poor eating and exercise habits.",
