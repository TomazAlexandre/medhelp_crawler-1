            "answer": "Breath problems are tough ones.\u00a0\u00a0To be certain, they are bacterial in nature but they often have another underlying cause.\u00a0\u00a0Many systemic conditions can cause said problems, such as diabetes, which produces what dentists call \"ketone breath\".\u00a0\u00a0Sounds like you may have a salivary flow problem.\u00a0\u00a0Your saliva acts not only to lubricate the mouth and help in chewing, but also to kill bacteria.\u00a0\u00a0If it is ropy (which, again, can be a symptom of a systemic condition), that tells me that there may be a problem with your salivary gland function.\u00a0\u00a0Are your tonsils abnormally large?\u00a0\u00a0Are you on any medications, such as allergy meds or hypertension drugs?\u00a0\u00a0There are a myriad of drugs that impair salivary flow and could worsen your problem.\u00a0\u00a0For a quick fix, you might look in to the Breath Rx line of products, but maybe what I have written will turn a light bulb on and help you realize something else you didn't think of previously that may be causing your condition.\u00a0\u00a0If not, don't be alarmed and all of a sudden think you have some radical problem you were not aware of.\u00a0\u00a0That is very unlikely.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps you are just unaware of what is causing the problem, and the answer is right in front of you.\u00a0\u00a0It's a tough issue, and I have many patients I shrug my shoulders at, too.\u00a0\u00a0I'd just suggest you look at your meds and health history, and take all the steps you can to reduce the bacterial load in your mouth.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes,",

    "question": "Hello,I have a very embarrassing question, but am hoping you can help.I am a 31 year old, healthy, female, but I am terribly afraid that I have bad breath ALL the time, even though I am diligent (to the point of almost obsessive) about my oral hygiene.\u00a0\u00a0I can't tell you how much i've spent on mouthwashes and toothpastes and tongue scrapers, etc.I have never been diagnosed with gum problems and at my last 6 month checkup, had no cavities, or other issues.I floss everyday, brush 2, 3, 4 or more times a day, chew lots of gum, etc.however, I feel like i always have bad breath.i constantly have the feelings like i have a big wad of thick salvia in the back of my throat and drainage (though it's always clear).\u00a0\u00a0the salvia gets worse and thicker when I brush or with certain foods (mainly soft drinks and chocolate so i try to avoid those things).I have tried meds for gerd, but they didn't seem to help with these issues.i just can't tell because i, personally, can't smell it.\u00a0\u00a0I try to 'breath' into my hands, but i can't smell anything.\u00a0\u00a0i've asked my mom and she says she hasn't noticed, but i'm afraid she just doesn't want to hurt my feelings. I'm too embarrassed to ask my husband so i have all but stopped kissing and close contact with ANYONE.WOULD i be able to smell if it was bad?\u00a0\u00a0 am i just being paranoid?please help!!thanks!",
