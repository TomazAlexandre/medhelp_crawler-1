            "answer": "Congrats, you appear to have your nutrition down solid. Don't consider all carbs in the same boat, we need 'good' carbs to give us fuel. But keep your carb intake at a minimum. Carbs next to sugar is a diabetics worse enemy. Google search simple vs complex carbs for suggestions. The latter is what you want to consume, the former avoid. Lastly, eat fruits with other foods to slow the absorption of fructose [fruit sugar].You should see a physical therapist at your local hospital for exercise suggestions. I have ideas but they may aggravate your osteoarthritis. Best leave this to a professional.By the way it's called A1c, not AC1. [smiling] The 5.9% equates to an 123 mg/dl glucose level. Diabetes starts at 126 mg/dl. Your doctor is correct, lose the gut and you have a great chance of reversing yourself back to normal levels. Good luck.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the responses. You've given me information I had not found. I'm all for trying the cleansing and supplements. I have been the supplement queen for several years since being diagnosed with Hep C. Horrible treatment, but I did beat it. This is when the healthy eating began and is very similar to the diabetes diet requirements. I have not been eating the fruit with my meals but will start.Thanks for correcting me on the A1c. Also checked our the simple/complex carbs which had me confused.One more question, my dr. will re do labs in three months. For some reason a three month wait is not comforting. Should I buy a meter now and check my sugar etc just to be safe?sdm52",

            "answer": "\"my dr. will re do labs in three months.\"This is probably a follow up A1c. The A1c measure your glucose over the past 2-3 months. Thus the wait period.\"Should I buy a meter now and check my sugar etc just to be safe?\"Why not? This way you will see how foods you consumed, along with weight loss and exercise, affected your glucose levels. Buy a reputable 'name' brand meter.\u00a0\u00a0Read the instructions carefully. Some meters require calibration prior to use. If you're uncertain on what to buy call your doctor's office and ask for their suggestion. In any case try to keep a daily log of your test results, average them out weekly then monthly, then your 3 mo avg. Take a copy of your log to the doctor's office.",

    "question": "Hello all,I've been lurking around off and on for a couple of weeks. Okay, I'm not good at the terminology yet, but I will catch on I promise.I was diagnosed with pre diabetes to type 2 a few weeks ago. I hope I get this right, my AC1 (?) is 5.9 and insulin 2.3. My dr. told me to cut the carbs and sugar, which I have done; and as he put it lose the gut. No one in my family has had diabetes.I'm female, 5'5\" 140 lbs. and 59 years old. Good grief, I need to exercise. So, I have started walking at lunch time when the weather permits. I've pull out the ab lounge and dusted off the cob webs. I have osteoarthritis in the toes, knees, hands, and shoulders so have to be careful not to aggravate the joints and cause further damage.\u00a0\u00a0I also have back problems so need to be careful not to throw it out of whack. Any suggestions other than the ab lounge and walking that I can possible do to get rid of the gut?As for food, a little rough cooking for me. I try to make meals I can freeze. My latest creation last weekend was brown rice with chicken breast cubed, carrots, spinach and corn all mixed together with garlic powder. I eat 12 grain bread, the wheat pasta's, have used stevia for years. I eat a lot of salads with plenty of veggies. Snack on carrots, celery, cucumbers, etc. Fruits are usually apples and avocado. What else should I be doing?And what can I drink besides water and my 3 cups of coffee in the morning?Okay, sorry for the book just wanted to make sure you had enough information to offer advice.Thanks to you all.sdm52",
