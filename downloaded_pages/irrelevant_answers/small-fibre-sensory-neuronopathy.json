            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I cannot tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.It is believed that most patients with small fiber neuropathy will experience a slowly progressive course with signs and symptoms spreading proximally over time.\u00a0\u00a0The progression of symptoms is thought to be slow, although we do not yet have long-term studies to confirm this.\u00a0\u00a0It is important to mention that treatment of associated conditions, such as diabetes, can substantially improve prognosis.\u00a0\u00a0In earlier stages of diabetes related neuropathy, the neuropathy may be reversible with proper medical management.If other causes for your symptoms have been ruled out, and are indeed related to a small fiber neuropathy, it appears that you are experiencing dysautonomia (malfunction of the autonomic nervous system).\u00a0\u00a0It may be helpful to seek the evaluation of a neurologist who specializes in this area to help with management of your symptoms.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "Hi57 year old woman from Scotland, I was dx with PN eight years ago since then things have progressed have now been dx with small fibre sensory neuronopathy(after seeing a professor in London) I have had every test imaginable and nothing has shown up to the cause. My neuro has informed me this condition is very rare and I\u00a0\u00a0cannot find out very much information about it, my concern is how bad can it get as I ended up in hospital a few weeks ago after passing out(been getting dizzy spells for a while) they put me on a heart monitor till next day as I have been getting palpatations again, have had for a few years take bisoprolol 5mg every day(tracing was fine), the thing that scared me a bit was when the consultant said the reason for keeping me in was my condition can affect the organs, I would appreciate very much if you can tell me what the future holds with this condition.......ty.........Marie",
