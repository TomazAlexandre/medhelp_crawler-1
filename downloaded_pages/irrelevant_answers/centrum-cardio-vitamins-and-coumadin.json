    "question": "I have been taking Coumadin since 1997 (I'm 59) due to heart valve surgery. Recently, I stopped taking all statin medications due to severe muscle pain and weakness getting worse. I am concerned about my cholesterol levels and triglycerides. I am on a strict diet, but high cholesterol and triglycerides are genetic. Is it safe for me to take Centrum Cardio Vitamins (with plant phytols) to help lower my cholesterol? Also, does buffered niacin (or non-flushing niacin) work equally as well as regular niacin in helping to lower cholesterol? And is it safe to take with coumadin?",
