            "answer": "Hi!The types of changes mentioned in the MRI are seen in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or Wilson's Disease, migraine headaches, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Though they are of no immediate threat, all these causes, and the presence of ischemic changes can be a risk factor for future stroke. Hence, prevention methods should include a healthy lifestyle, and a combination of diet, exercise, and medicines. You should also aim to improve your memory through memory games and especially designed exercises. For this you will need to consult a neuro-psychiatrist. Also, the sinus issues have to be dealt with as chronic sinusitis too can affect the brain function. Please discuss with your treating doctors. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
