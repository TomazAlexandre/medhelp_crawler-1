            "answer": "Hi Judy,Welcome to the Senior Health Forum. I am glad that you found us and took the time to post ... but so VERY sorry to hear about your Nanna's condition. I am sure this is very difficult time and my heart goes out to you.There is no way of knowing the outcome of your Nanna's medical situation. I have seen patients older then your Nanna recover and return to previous functioning levels. I have also seen younger patients succumb in the same or similar medical condition/situation.The chance of a repeat cardiac episode is highest in approximately the first 72 hours. The amount of heart muscle damage and your Nanna's previous health will play a roll in her recovery to some degree. She is probably receiving an IV diuretic (like Lasix) to decrease any fluid build up around her heart and lungs. I assume they are watching for CHF (Congestive Heart Failure) that can follow a MI, especially in seniors.Prayers, love and the skill of her physician(s) should all be relied upon at this time. None of us can guess the outcome. I do wish you both the best and will be thinking of you. Please let us know how you and your Nanna is doing.Take Care,~Tuck",

            "answer": "I would be very optimistic. Meanwhile you can assume they are giving her the best of care.There are good chances for full recovery, but it depends upon the degree of damage. The term \"heart attack\" is rather meaningless.Visit often, hold her hand or keep your hand on her shoulder when you visit, and do not hesitate to inquire as to the name of the physician on duty and ask him, or the duty nurse a question every time you visit. Not that patients are ignored, but in a busy hospital\u00a0\u00a0\"the squeaky wheel gets the grease\".One of the biggest problems is the oxygen bubbler, which can pump water into the lungs, and the respiratory techs do not always pay attention to this.Ask if you can bring her little \"treats\" such as her favorite ice-cream or yogurt and do so.If you can bring a little radio with earphones or a means she can listen to music do so.",
