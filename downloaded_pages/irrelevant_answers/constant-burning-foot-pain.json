            "answer": "Hello,This constant burning pain has been present after the foot was stabbed, hence it looks like a local nerve trauma and nerve irritation. You need to consult a neurologist and get a nerve conduction test and nerve biopsy done. Also then other important causes of burning feet like diabetes and peripheral vascular disease need to be ruled out. It is important to get your fasting blood sugar levels done to confirm the diagnosis.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
