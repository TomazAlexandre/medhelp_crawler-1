            "answer": "I have Gestational Diabetes. My OB is keeping a close watch of me and baby by me coming in to see him every week till my daughter is born. I did not see a diabetes specialest but I did meet with a dietetion. She went over portion sizes, carb counting, good and bad choices, and alot reading material and lists.\u00a0\u00a0It is really easy and not scary at all. I check my blood sugars 4 times a day in the morning and two hours after every meal. Every doctor is different but for me my doctor wont put me on meds unless out of my weekly blood sugars more than a third of them are higher than they need to be. Just eat healthy and keep a good track of levels and you should be fine. I have been warned once you get farther along levels tend to get higher and if a good diet does not help may need meds. May try a oral med first and if that does not help the may go to insulin. I know alot of women who managed fine with just diet no meds what so ever so dont be alarmed. When the baby is born I have heard they tend to be a little bit bigger but thats not always the case and they have low blood sugar when they are born and may need itravenous meds or just sugar water to bring it up but thats not always the case either. I also read they have higher risk of jaundice but a few hours under a light helps and even natural sunlight at home. Remember everyone is different and you will know whats best for you. I hope some of this helps and wish you luck.",

            "answer": "I have to see a specialist for my gd. She's called a perinatologist basically all she does is check my list of blood sugar counts and do an ultrasound to see how baby is growing. She just recently had me start coming in twice a week for a NST. Which is basically just sitting there strapped to a monitor for 30 minutes while they measure baby's movements and any contractions I might have.",

What should I expect when I see the specialist? What do they do?2.
