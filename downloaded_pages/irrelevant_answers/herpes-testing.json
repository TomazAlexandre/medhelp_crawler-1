    "question": "Hello all,About a year ago, I went to the doctor because I was having many yeast infections. The doctor wanted to do testing for all the STD's and also herpes. All the STD tests were ok but the herpes test came back pos. for both of them, they did a blood test from my arm. I still do not show any signs of herpes. I want to go back to another doctor for more testing but they do not offer the herpes select test, which I got off this site. What test should I ask for when I go back to the doctor. I would like to know which one I have to be for sure. Thanks",
