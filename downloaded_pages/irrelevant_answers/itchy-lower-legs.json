            "answer": "Hi Ma'am,How are you? The itching may be attributed to skin disorders, certain diseases, certain medications, dry skin, contact with irritants, fungal infection and the act of scratching can cause further itching. Systemic diseases that can cause itching include liver disease, kidney failure, lymphomas, leukemias and other blood disorders, and, occasionally, thyroid disease, diabetes, and cancer. Have this evaluated further to rule out\u00a0\u00a0conditions mentioned.\u00a0\u00a0Moisturizers and antihistamines may help provide relief.Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I'm a 43 year old woman. The last few weeks, my lower legs itch like crazy. There's no rash, no bumps, no hives. I've used lotions including Sarna. Not much help. Nowhere else on my body itches. If it were due to allergies to, say, dryer sheets, wouldn't it be all over my body or at least in the most prone areas such as my under arm areas, thighs, stomach, etc.?The only thing I've done different is began taking Theanine Serene with Relora to help with my anxiety disorder. I can't afford to see a psychiatrist and I definitely can't afford the rx they'd most likely prescribe. This is why I'm trying the alternative route. I looked up these alternative ingredients and found nothing on the net about anyone ever having side effects.What's happening to me?",
