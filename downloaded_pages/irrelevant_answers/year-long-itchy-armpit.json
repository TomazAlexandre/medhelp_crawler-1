            "answer": "Hello,For such kind of itchy armpit, fungal infection and eczema need to be ruled out. for ruling out fungal infection, KOH examination of the skin scrapings can be done and a biopsy skin will help rule out any eczema.Decreased or absent sweating is called anhidrosis. It may be caused in autonomic neuropathy like diabetes, alcoholism, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome(an autoimmune disease causing inflammation and decreased secretions by certain glands of the body) and Ross syndrome(a peripheral nerve disorder) ; skin conditions like hidradenitis suppurativa ;medicines like anticholinergics, tricyclic antidepressants and some antipsychotic;genetic disorder(hypohydrotic ectodermal dysplasia) and dehydration.I feel that a clinical evaluation and investigations are needed in confirming a diagnosis. Please consult a physician/neurologist for the same.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
