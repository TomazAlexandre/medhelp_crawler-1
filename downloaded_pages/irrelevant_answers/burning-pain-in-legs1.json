            "answer": "Hi madhusudhan,How are you feeling now?You mentioned you are having this feeling from past 6 years, what all treatment modalities and imaging being done to evaluate this problem?Have you consulted a neurologist so far?Any form tingling, numbness or burning sensations arises due to some nerve pathology.Either it can be due to nerve being damaged or diseased. Damaging to nerve can occur due to nerve impingement along its course of distribution or any trauma directly to nerve.There are some systemic causes like Diabetes, fluctuation in BP, vitamin deficiency, dehydration which will affect the nerves as well.I think you need to consult a neurologist, if you have not consulted one.If you have already consulted a neurologist, then you should be taking a review opinion on this.Hope this helps.Keep me informed regarding your decision and disease progression.Bye.",
