    "question": "Our 3 yr old son has had many problems since birth. He has a slightly lower than normal muscle tone. One side of his face was bigger due to a weak muscle. It has gotten alot better. His main problems right now are hypo and hyperglycemia. This has gone on for amlost 2 years now. When sick his sugar drops to about 30 and then goes high when treating it. He has had many episodes where, after eating... (usually, something with high carbs) his sugar will drop to the 40's! The low blood sugars are accompanied with screaming, and crying, and 'what looks like rage!' He doens't understand anything at the time. His sugar leves have been as high as 496. They do not stay high and he does not have diabetes. He has EXTREMELY bad leg pains! He may be getting ready to have a muscle biopsy. We just got his labs back from August.. His ck levels were normal at 101, his pyruvate was.7, also normal. His lactic acid was 2.7 which is pretty low, right? Normal is 4.5 to 19.8. Does this mean anything? He is due to see a neurologist (muscle specialist) on the 25th. He tires easily. He cannot play in the heat without his sugar dropping to at least 60 within an hour.He constantly want's to drink soda. It has been a while since he has had a high sugar level. The most recent problem was 2 nights ago. When he ate Raisin Bran cereal and a few extra raisins... About 30 mintues later his sugar dropped to 49! He was in a fit..Rolled over on his face and his hands clinched. However, after a few minutes, his sugar slowly started coming back up on it's own. With nothig to drink or eat. What could this be?",
