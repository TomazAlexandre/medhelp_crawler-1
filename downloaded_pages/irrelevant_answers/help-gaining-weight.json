            "answer": "This may not be what you want to hear, but maturation is probably going to take care of your thinness.\u00a0\u00a0You just have to be patient.\u00a0\u00a0It actually was the norm for American teenagers to be thin until about 1980, when our eating habits started changing for the worse.\u00a0\u00a0People of all ages got heavier when we started to eat a lot of junk food and drink a lot of soda pop -- but I don't recommend that, because it's not healthy.Eat healthy food, and eat all you want.\u00a0\u00a0Have fun with your exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Love yourself as you are. Eat all you want of healthy foods like whole-grain breads, fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meats, fish, and nuts and seeds.\u00a0\u00a0Other than that, I don't know of any good way to gain weight.\u00a0\u00a0You may simply not be able to gain much weight at age 14, and that's normal.\u00a0\u00a0Leave the junk food and sugar alone.\u00a0\u00a0They're not good for you, and you can form bad habits with those unhealthy foods that will stick with you for many years, even after you have gained all the weight you want to.You can eat full-fat dairy products, because you can use the calories.\u00a0\u00a0You don't need to drink reduced fat milk or skim milk, and you don't need to eat reduced fat cheese.\u00a0\u00a0If you enjoy eating nuts and seeds (like sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds), you can eat all you want of those.\u00a0\u00a0If you do like nuts and seeds, you can eat handfuls of them raw or dry-roasted, but I would stay away from the ones cooked in oil, because the oil that is used for that is not usually the healthiest.For the age that you are, your body is doing what nature intended.\u00a0\u00a0Please don't judge your appearance by comparing yourself to mature women or even to the girls your own age who live on junk food and soda pop.\u00a0\u00a0Many of your peers are, in truth, overweight.\u00a0\u00a0Don't be jealous of them.\u00a0\u00a0Instead, be happy.The right clothes look fantastic on slender girls.\u00a0\u00a0Just get good at picking out the styles that flatter you.\u00a0\u00a0You will be able to wear certain things that most girls can't wear and wish they could.\u00a0\u00a0Try on lots of clothes in the mirror, see what you think looks good on your, and also get feedback from others about what you look good in.\u00a0\u00a0When you get a compliment on your clothes, figure out what it was about that piece that makes you look good, and focus on adding more of that style to your wardrobe.The real issue is not to gain weight, but to be happy in your life.\u00a0\u00a0Right?\u00a0\u00a0Okay, you can do it.",
