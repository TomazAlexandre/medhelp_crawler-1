            "answer": "I had migranes from magnesium deficiency. And I lost excess magnesium through the urine due to insulin resistance. Not a single labs showed up insulin resistance except the insulin test and my insulin levels were very high. My symptoms already told me all about insulin resistance however!I know insulin resistance is a symptom (some say a cause) of PCOS. I can suggest taking magnesium supplements. The right type of magnesium as some do not absorb well. Magnesium oxide only absorbs 4% for instance. I take magnesium chelated with amino acids.Also the LCHF (low carb high fat) diet would be worth trying out as well. Excerpts from two articles from Diet Doctor...School Refuses to Serve Food that Keeps Student Healthy...\"Emil Elmqvist, 17 years old, didn\u2019t just lose 66 lbs (30 kg) when he began eating an LCHF diet. He also lost his troublesome migraines, which is a common positive side effect of LCHF.\"\u201cLCHF Helped Me Get Pregnant!\u201d...\"Isabelle Nelson is another woman who struggled in vain to get pregnant, due to the common hormonal imbalance PCOS. But after adopting a LCHF diet and losing 35 lbs in two months what so often happens happened:Just for fun, she took a pregnancy test. The test showed that she was pregnant.\"",

            "answer": "I just found this info...\"In the 1980s, research on the role of insulin resistance in the development of PCOS became widely known in the fertility treatment community. It appears that insulin resistance probably contributes to the development of PCOS in most women. In some of these women, insulin resistance is related to obesity and genetic factors, both of which are also linked to PCOS.\"I knew that was likely as PCOS was so rare in the 50's and now it's common like obesity and diabetes. I personally ate too much sugar and developed severe insulin resistance.",
