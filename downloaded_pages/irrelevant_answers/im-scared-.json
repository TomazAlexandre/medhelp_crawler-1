            "answer": "If you are in America generic insulin (Humalin N and Humalin-R) can be bought over the counter at wall mart and other pharmacies.\u00a0\u00a0This does not give as flat a response as the modern insulins, but they still work and may tide you over until you can get back on insurance.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully your dr can guide\u00a0\u00a0you on their use.",

            "answer": "As well as making good choices of what you are eating and drinking, do some form of physical exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Even if you go for a walk twice a day is better than nothing.Exercising will help to boost your metabolism to burn the energy that you are eating.Eat small portions - have your 3 main meals with a healthy snack in between.\u00a0\u00a0Don't forget that drinking fizzy drinks, fruit juices and squashes will also spike up your sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0Drink more water instead of juices.You can look on the web of what a \"healthy plate\" looks like to help you choose the right foods.\u00a0\u00a0Portion sizes are important too as well as exercise.Have you recently had any steroids, or have an infection?\u00a0\u00a0This will spike up your sugar levels.If you can, it would probably helpful for you to see a diabetic nurse and a dietician that specialises in diabetes.What types of diabetic meds are you on?\u00a0\u00a0You do not need to answer that.Metformin does come in different strengths and also as a Slow Release.My husband was put on Victosa (injection) as well as other tablets.\u00a0\u00a0He asked to be put on the normal insulin and that with the Metformin 1000mg SR has been working for him.\u00a0\u00a0He does for 2 walks a day and we have changed our diet.A tip for you.\u00a0\u00a0If you buy yogurts and ready made meals - do check the ingredients label and the percentages of what the product contains.\u00a0\u00a0Avoid having anything that has more than 3% of sugar per 100grm.\u00a0\u00a0Foods that are labelled \"healthy\" may not be as healthy as you may think.\u00a0\u00a0Low fat products usually contain more sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Sugar comes under different names - anything ending with \"ose\" will be a form of sugar, eg. glucose, fructose, maltose.Best wishes.Best of luck.",

            "answer": "Sometimes you can call the manufacture of the insulin and see if they have a program where they give u the insulin for free. When I was laid off I researched and I was on lantus and I reached out and they sent the paper work to my doctor and I got my meds free for almost a year. Until my insurance came through. Look into it. It first hurt. Good luck",
