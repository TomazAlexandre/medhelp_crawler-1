            "answer": "It's very simple. If u had a c section b4, the likelihood is that ur having another. Very few doc will let u try naturally after u had 1. If u haven't or its ur 1st then u will try naturally until either u can't push any more n r exhausted n have no strength left or u or baby go into distress. Witch the doc won't know til u r delivering. Or after ur 36 weeks when they check u n if u have ur placenta covering the cervix u will n\u00e9e a c section. If baby is breech n they can't turn him u will need a csection. Or any type of medical emergency u will need a c section like if u have preeclamsia, umbilical is wrapped around the neck or sometimes if u have diabetes. Etc. But this the doc will know once it's closer to due date. If ur not having complications then ur going for natural birth.",
