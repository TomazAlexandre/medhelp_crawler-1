            "answer": "Hi!Well, the report rules out Myesthenia gravis because the amplitude decrement on repetitive nerve stimulation was not more than 10% of elicited CMAPS. The report however finds compression of sacral nerve roots, often responsible for sciatica type of pain.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or symptoms mimicking ALS, chronic fatigue syndrome, lupus, and Lymes can also cause muscle weakness. ALS like symptoms can be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, severe anemia, spinal nerve compression high up in the cervical spine, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritic changes of the vertebrae, calcium deficiency, low Vit D, electrolyte disturbance, peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or hypothyroidism or due to bad posture. Hence these should be tested for.Please discuss with your treating doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I have an EMG test that the doctor cannot explain. It say I have these complex findings: \u201c Repetitive stimulation of the left posterior tibial nerve (recording AH) found a decrement in amplitude, but not area of more than 10% of elicited CMAPS.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0It also said I have \u201csevere ongoing denervation of my S1 and S2.\u201dThe report recommended that I have further \u201cproximal muscle testing, but my neurologist refused.\u00a0\u00a0He said \u201cyou already had an EMG test.\u201dI have constant sacroiliac aching and stiffness (worse in the mornings, when my legs feel slightly numb and heavy.)I cannot stand or walk longer than about 20-30 minutes, because it causes leg\u00a0\u00a0muscle pain (burning heaviness like cement) in both legs that gets progressively worse when I stand or walk, and it is relieved when I sit.Also, my arm muscles hurt when I exercise or stretch them and they get heavy, also. I feel sick, too.Can anyone tell me what my EMG means and what is wrong with my legs?",
