            "answer": "Hello,Neuropathy, the abnormal function of the nerves resulting in hypersensitivity and complaints of burning, numbness and lack of sensation in the feet and legs, is frequently associated with diabetes. Is your husband diabetic.It may or may not be associated with \"poor circulation\". Peripheral Arterial blockages, which causes poor circulation, can cause neuropathy over time because the nerve function may be damaged by the lack of oxygen over a long period.In this case the CT scan may have indicated the degree of blockage in the illiac blood vessels. The fact that it just described tortuous and atherosclerotic\" vessels does not neccessarily mean that there was signicant blockagesIf there are significant blockages in the iliac vessels, these blockages can usually be treated by angioplasty (balloon) with or without stent placement. This is one of the few areas where the results of balloons and stents approach the durability of surgery.Your husband should have pulse volume recording (pvr) or ankle brachial index (abi) to evaluate the state of his circulation to the feet. Good Luck",

    "question": "My 77 years old husband developed neuropathy in both legs closely following bypass surgery.\u00a0\u00a06 years later a CT Scan for an aortic aneurysm picked up \"atherosclerotic and tortuous\"\u00a0\u00a0common iliac arteries.\u00a0\u00a0He was on morphine for 4 years and now he's on Hydrocodone.\u00a0\u00a0My guess is that now he has PAD with his neruropathy. He is not diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Would, if this diagnosis is true, be eligible for\u00a0\u00a0balloon therapy?\u00a0\u00a0He had Medicaid and Medicare.\u00a0\u00a0The aneurysm was only 3.5 cm so that's not an issue.Sandy in FL",
