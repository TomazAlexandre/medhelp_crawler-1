            "answer": "The gynomastia would merit some lab tests. Sounds like you might have hormonal probs in addition to the pain issues. I'm thinking that you should see an endocrinologist who specializes in non-diabetes, like a neuroendocrinologist. I'm thinking that your thyroid and maybe some others are not behaving themselves.Your thyroid (hair thinning, gynomastia, energy levels), adrenal (makes precursors to the sex hormones and cortisol which can cause fatigue if low) and pituitary gland (master gland that makes a LOT of hormones that control the other glands and prolactin) should be evaluated and there are labs tests for this.At least you rule this out by getting the tests.HorselipEspecially have your prolactin. testosterone, LH/FSH, Free T3, Free T4, AM cortisol, IGF-1, aldosterone, DHEA-S",

            "answer": "Hello Arnold,Welcome to the Pain Mangement Forum. I had a bit of trouble following your post so forgive me if I have misunderstood something.I agree with horselip. I too think you need to check into the function of your thyroid. It may be helpful to be evaluated by an endocrinologist. They do more than specialize in diabetes, though some to focus more in that area.An endocrinologist specialize in the endocrine systems which includes the structure and function of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, the\u00a0\u00a0thyroid gland, the pancreas (where the islets of Langerhans that secrete insulin and glucagon is located), adrenal glands, the\u00a0\u00a0sex organs (ovaries & testes hormones) and the pineal gland (located in your brain).The abnormal coloration of your urine may be offering a clue that should be investigated. Sometimes if the urine is rust color it can signal a disorder in your lymph system. The lymphatic system is an extensive drainage network that helps keep bodily fluid levels in balance and defends the body against infections. It is made up of a network of lymphatic vessels that carry lymph (a clear, watery fluid\u00a0\u00a0that contains protein molecules, salts, glucose, urea, and other substances) throughout the bodyIn other words some thinking outside the box may be beneficial. If you begin with one specialist, such as an endocrinologist they can refer you on to another speciality once they have ruled out anything related to the endocrine system.I know it's frustrating when you keep running into dead ends but I encourage you to keep searching for answers. You are much too young to continue with problematic undiagnosed systems.I hope you will keep in touch with us and let us know how you are doing. I will look forward with great interest to hear the results of your searching. Please fel free to ask additional questions. Best of luck to you.Peace,~Tuck",
