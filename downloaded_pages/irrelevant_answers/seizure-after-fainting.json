            "answer": "Hi,Both high and low sugar levels can cause seizures. This a problem specially seen in diabetics whose blood sugar levels fluctuate over time due to medications, concurrent illnesses and metabolic factors.This seems to be likely cause in your friend\u2019s case too. I would suggest you to ask her to discuss this issue with her treating doctor and keep a close watch on her blood sugar levels.If the condition still persists she needs to undergo an EEG exam to rule out epilepsy.Thanks",
