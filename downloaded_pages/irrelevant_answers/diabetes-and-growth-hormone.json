            "answer": "Hi,You certainly have been through a great deal in the past years and have quite a complicated history. I am sure you are reday to feel well again, but I do not know if I have a quick answer for you, given your complex history and my inability to know it well.I will say that if you have all those autoimmune disorders, you most likely have a type of Endocrine disease called APS--Autoimmune polyglandular Syndrome, where multiple organs are involved.\u00a0\u00a0Your questions: 1) Re another stim test for growth hormone production--I am not sure where your growth hormone deficiency is coming from, so rechecking it may be a good idea, but this is one best left to your doctors who know your complete history. 2)Stim test for Addisons--most likely if the Addisons is true Addisons(from autoimune destruction) then repeating the stim test will not change your management, and I am afraid doctors do not use the results of the stim test to figure out your steroid dose. So it may put you through another test for nothing. 3) the fluctuating blood sugars--a very complicated situation. what are you taking for diabetes right now? Do you track the numbers during the day? Are they related to the timing of your steroid dose? You need someone to review your blood sugar log and diet to help you figure this one out. 4)I think a good endocrinologist and also a neurologist shold be the combination that helps the best5)Growth hormone and cancer--there are some concerns out there but I think good monitoring of your health AND the correct dosing of the medication should help take care of those concerns.I am sorry I could not give more specific advice but your history is quite complicated and without complete information I cannot give specifics. Take care and talk over all your concerns with your doctor soon,Anita Ramsetty,MD",

            "answer": "Wow! You have really been through a great deal. I am terribly sorry. I believe, if a person has one autoimmune disease there is an increased risk ( I think\u00a0\u00a0I read up to 25%) that they will have more than one. You may want to go to a\u00a0\u00a0medical center (like Clevland Clinic) or a university hosiptal for evaluation.Good luck.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 5 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I was placed on avandamet, but was changed to metformin and avandia when they stopped manufacturing it.\u00a0\u00a0My blood sugar started flip-flopping and got so bad that it was dropping into the 20's and 30's.\u00a0\u00a0I got my gp to send me to an endocrinologist and he did a lot of test (including two seperate stimulation tests).\u00a0\u00a0He said my body was producing no growth hormone and no steroids.\u00a0\u00a0He placed me on both and I have been taking them for over a year.\u00a0\u00a0During this year I have gained 30 pounds, my stomach is hard as are the muscles in my shoulders.\u00a0\u00a0I have constant back pain and my blood sugar is once again fluctuating from the 30's to the 300's.\u00a0\u00a0The endocrinologist wrote down a diagnosis of Addison's disease.\u00a0\u00a0I have read all about it, and think it could be the answer.\u00a0\u00a0My problem is with the fluctuating sugar levels and weight gain and muscle tightness shouldn't another stim test be done to make sure I still need the growth hormone and steroids.\u00a0\u00a0I also have multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia.\u00a0\u00a0Since all of these are autoimmune diseases should my adrenal and pituitary glands be checked out?\u00a0\u00a0I have been to numerous specialists and it seems they all find something within their specialty, give me medicine for it and think that's it.\u00a0\u00a0Is there such a doctor as a diagnostician that can take everything wrong with me and tell me what is wrong?\u00a0\u00a0I was also diagnosed with celiac's disease and vitamin d deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0I am desperate to find an answer.\u00a0\u00a0I am worried about continuing on the growth hormone because I have heard it causes cancer to grow at an accelerated rate.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have cancer now, but did in 1976 *(cervical).\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I am dying and they will find out what is wrong with me after I'm dead.\u00a0\u00a0If you have any suggestions, please reply.Thanks.",
