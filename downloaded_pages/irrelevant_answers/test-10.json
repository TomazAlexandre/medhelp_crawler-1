            "answer": "Pump therapy in diabetes can be very beneficial. A pump can reduce the incidence of high blood sugars as well as low blood sugar. Pump therapy also enables the pump wearer to have more flexibility in what they can eat and also when they eat. The pump makes it easier to live life without limits and if you don't want to eat you don't have to eat. I love my pump and would recommend it to anyone as long as they were ready and wanted the responsibility of having a piece of hardware with them at all times. Even while they are sleeping.",
