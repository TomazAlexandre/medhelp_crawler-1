            "answer": "She has had thyroid problems. In fact, she had to have half of it taken out a long time ago. Underactive thyroid by the way. When we went to the doctor, he told us that the thyroid wasn't causing all her symptoms and that something else was. She's not on any medications, she's not diabetic. Nobody else in the family has these symptoms. Besides that thyroid part, she's been healthy as a horse.",

    "question": "Hello, I can't seem to figure out what my mother has. Keep in mind she's 55 and has gone through menopause. She's had extreme swelling in her face, throat, hands, feet, stomach, and tongue for about 2.5 years now. No one can find out what's wrong, except a dermatologist says it's an allergic reaction to something. We've changed everything in the house, including food, detergents, fabrics, candles, anything that may cause a reaction, and no luck. We even tried to see if it was Gluten related and that was ruled out. The skin on her fingers is turning a yellow-ish color, is extremely rough, and even peeling. She tells me that sometimes she loses feeling in said hands quite often, and sometimes her feet. Also, whenever she goes outside, and might sweat from yard work, she bleeds through the pores in her arms. If anyone knows anything about these symptoms and what might be causing it..please let me know asap. Thanks for your time.",
