            "answer": "Thank you Buggie I have looked up all about PCOS\u00a0\u00a0in fact it was me that found out that she had all the symptoms when she was 13\u00a0\u00a0no comutors then went to the local library and looked up the symptoms myself and I took her to the fifth doctor\u00a0\u00a0that I had asked about the symptoms she had such as bulking up from a skinny little girl to looking like a swimmer who had been taking steriods and having pain each month and having facial hair she should\u00a0\u00a0not have had at that age . This was at The Royal Womens Hospital in Melbourne Australia and the professer that we saw said she looks perfectly fine to me and I said well she's not ,she was sometimes nearly collapsing when I went to pick her up after school . She was doing ballet at the time and\u00a0\u00a0of course weightgoing on was no noso she was beside herself about gaining weight and that led to Bullimia\u00a0\u00a0four doctors treated me like an idiot and then that comment from the Professer really threw me he then said\u00a0\u00a0I am sending her upstairs to have an ultra sound just to satisfy youWell the lady who did the ultra sound called me in to have a look she said she had never seen anything like it so many cysts\u00a0\u00a0. So\u00a0\u00a0I was furious the solution was according to the Professer was to put her on the pill and of course thats what I did . Buggie I also didn't say before but my husband her father is a Vietnam Veteran who was exposed to Agent Orange so goodness knows if this caused all the probs she has had\u00a0\u00a0. Please pray for her she is a\u00a0\u00a0lovely girl and the best daughter and would make a lovely mum\u00a0\u00a0thanks again for your replyPS\u00a0\u00a0No diabetes in our family at all",

            "answer": "I know plenty of ppl who have PCOS who's parents are not diabetic, did not take meds while preg, and whose fathers were not exposed to agent orange. I am one of those ppl. My symptoms didn't show til I was about 24. The same thing with a co-worker of mine. In order to get pregnant I saw a Reproductive Endocrinologist. Look for one there in Australia if you haven't already. They understand fertility and the PCOS so they are able to treat both.\u00a0\u00a0Please don't blame yourself. I think its just a thing that happens in nature.",
