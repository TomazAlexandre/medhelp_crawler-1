            "answer": "HiThis could be folliculitis. Nothing can be said with surety however without having a look at the lesions.In most individuals there are outbreaks of folliculitis from time to time.Folliculitis is infection and inflammation of the hair follicles. The condition may be superficial (i.e., on the surface of the skin) or deep within the follicles.The most common cause of folliculitis is infection by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus.Folliculitis symptoms can appear independent of infection. Exposure of the skin to certain chemicals, especially oils and tars, can trigger an outbreak. People with depressed immune systems, diabetes, or obesity have a greater risk of contracting folliculitis than the general population.Patients with chronic unresponsive folliculitis may require investigation into the source of the infection. S. aureus bacteria can live in the patient's nostrils, periodically triggering a folliculitis outbreak.Individuals who are predisposed to folliculitis should be extremely careful about personal hygiene. Application of antiseptic washes may help prevent recurrences. A topical antibiotic cream, mupirocin (Bactroban\u00ae), has been effective at reducing bacterial colonization in the nostrils. It is applied twice daily for a week and is repeated every 6 months.If there any of the mentioned medical causes then treating those will reduce the occurence of the condition.http://www.dermatologychannel.net/follicle/folliculitis.shtmlSome stubborn cases of folliculitis have been responsive to laser-assisted hair removal. This process uses a laser to destroy the follicle. This reduces the scarring that results from folliculitis.Let us know if you need any other information and consult a skin specialist if the lesion is persistent.Regards.",

            "answer": "Hi,Glad the post was of some help to you.You need to wash the areas several times with fresh water. Do not use any cosmetic products at the sites.Apply calamine lotion at the site of the lesions and see if it helps. You could take some oral antihistamine medications like cetrizine or loratadine. You need to maintain a good personal hygiene .Anti-itch drugs, often antihistamine, may reduce the itch during a flare up of eczema, and the reduced scratching in turn reduces damage and irritation to the skin.Let us know about how you are doing and if you need any other information.Post us about what your doctor advises.Regards.",

    "question": "Ive had a red postule that is maybe half a centimeter in diameter for three months now in my pubic area. I originally thought that it was just an ingrown hair but i could never fish out any hair, ive tried to find any hair and there is nothing there. Also, it fills up with pus. It hasn't really gotten any bigger and it is the only one that i have. It doesn't hurt too much unless it rubs against something hard or i pop it. I have no idea how to get rid of this",
