            "answer": "There is no doctor on this forum, and this is fairly off the topic of diabetes. But I'll comment on it anyway because I worked with alcoholics for many years. Your dad has to want to stop drinking for any kind of treatment to help. If he wants to, I would advise him to attend AA meetings and to see a doctor to see if antabuse would be an option for him. There also are alcoholism forums here that you could post to. If he doesn't want help I would advise you to take care of yourselves. Alanon is a great place to talk with other family members.Back to diabetes, my guess is your dad isn't taking care of his diabetes and the price he will pay for that will be extreme. (amputations, kidney failure). I hope he can get into recovery.",

            "answer": "It is difficult watching someone you love destroy themselves.As Zoelula AA meetings are one road to take. It is going to be difficult to convince him to listen to you.Antabuse is another option, but that is up to the physician.If you are in a church that he attends the pastor might be helpful. Unfortunately this is no longer the case in most communities.Talk to other family members. Sometimes a meeting where all family members confront the alcoholic is helpful in getting them treatment.You are in my prayers.",

    "question": "i wanted to get a doctors opinion. My dad has been heavily drinking for\u00a0\u00a0at least 20 years. In the past 10 years, hes been on and off. For example, he'll stop drinking for 6 months and then he'll drink after 2 or 3 months and then stop again for 6 months. I know he wants to drink the way he used to when he was younger (he used to drink for one week straight-sometimes more- without eating anything and he would stop when his health got extremly bad) but because hes 51 his body cant really take that much alcohol anymore. When he drinks hes very out of control, he wont sleep or eat anything, all he wants to do is drink and drink. he will do same thing in the morning, without eating. Basically, he'll go for weeks without eating or anything else and only drinking alcohol. Now, almost every night he drinks about 2 Henkien 26 ounces light beer. We want him to stop because hes diabetic, has high blood pressure and its just not good for the family.Anyways, my question is do you think anatbuse would be good for him? Will it work? All help, suggestions, and opinions will be greatly appreciated, Thank you!",
