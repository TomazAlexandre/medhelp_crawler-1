            "answer": "Hi,Are there other symptoms present? This could be urinary incontinence, which can result from anatomic, physiologic, or pathologic factors. This could present as frequent nighttime urination, inability to void, even when the urge is felt or dribbling even after voiding. There are several conditions that could lead to this condition such as: benign prostatic hyperplasia;\u00a0\u00a0neurogenic bladder, tumors, and urinary stones .In particular, overflow incontinence is a common symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. If the prostate gland is enlarged,\u00a0\u00a0it may obstruct the passage of urine through the urethra. This will lead to the symptoms. Neurogenic bladder associated with overflow incontinence is caused by the loss of sensation of bladder fullness due to damage or obstruction of sacral nerves and may also be a complication of various diseases such as diabetes mellitus and polio.\u00a0\u00a0Urinary stones may also block the urethra and cause overflow incontinence.It would be best to have this evaluated further for proper management, A complete medical history and physical examination and some laboratory tests are important in determining the diagnosis. Take care and do keep us posted.",
