            "answer": "I was wondering if you've had any other tests done? There are a number of things that can cause the problems you describe, blood sugar disorders (pre-diabetic conditions), undiagnosed clinical depression, and being estrogen dominant (unbalanced female hormones) being at the top of the list. The body is a unit, and what effects one system may effect others. (For example, in diabetes your pancreas isn't working properly and the change the insulin has on your metabolism can result in secondary changes in your thyroid levels.) If you haven't already, keep a diary of your symptoms, what you eat and when, and how much you sleep and at what times. If you feel it may be hormone related, do this for a month, if not, a week or two. You may see patterns that you weren't aware of. Take this to your endo with your next appointment and make him LISTEN to you. Be your own advocate. Hopefully, this will get you started on a path of wellness...To your good health, ~MM",

    "question": "I am 100 lbs overweight, tired, no energy, forgetful, and sometimes have \"brain fog\".\u00a0\u00a0Eating a meal with carbs seems to make the lethargy unbearable, to the point that I can hardly control the desire to go lay down somewhere.\u00a0\u00a0My bloodwork has consistently been out of whack for about 12 years.\u00a0\u00a0When my last child was born 16 years ago, I noticed a distinct difference in my mental ability - whereas before he was born, I was sharp, afterwards I couldn't remember anything and was just all of a sudden stupid.\u00a0\u00a0My thyroid tests always come back low on TSH and the rest normal.\u00a0\u00a0This is my last test:Thyroxine (T4) Free, Direct\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.01 ng/dLTSH\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00.180L uIU/mLT3\u00a0\u00a0 195 ng/dLThyroid Peroxidase (TPO) ab\u00a0\u00a0<10 IU/mLI was referred to an endocrinologist who said that no treatment was needed.\u00a0\u00a0I just don't get how I could have symptoms of being hypothyroid but have bloodwork that indicates hyperthyroid.What do you think?Thanks,BettyBoop201",
