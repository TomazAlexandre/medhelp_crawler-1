            "answer": "Hi,I think it could be Candida or Streptococcus infection called Erysipelas.This is an acute inflammation of the skin with lymphatic involvement. The streptococci are localized in the dermis and hypodermis. It usually affects the face, particularly in the elderly, but may occur elsewhere. It may be bilateral and is sometimes recurrent. There is usually a history of sore throat, but the mode of spread to the skin is unknown. It is usually accompanied by fever, rigors, and toxicity. The cutaneous lesion begins as a localized area of erythema and swelling and then spreads with rapidly advancing raised red margins that are well demarcated from adjacent normal tissue. Facial erysipelas begins over the bridge of the nose and spreads over the cheeks. Vesicles and bullas appear which become crusted when they rupture.It can also be either Psoriasis or Steven-Johnson syndrome.Keep me posted.Bye.",
