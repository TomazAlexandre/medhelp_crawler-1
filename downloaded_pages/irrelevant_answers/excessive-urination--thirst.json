            "answer": "You're posting here because you think your thirst and frequent urination symptom is related to diabetes. This is true but the urination part also can be related to prostrate problems, urinary tract infection, and/or a bladder a infection. You need to see a doctor for a complete evaluation and necessary treatment. It won't go away on its own, it will only get worse to the point of hospitalization. Get off the computer and go see a doctor. After seeing a doctor post back if you have questions on diabetes. Good luck.",

            "answer": "\"I also wonder whethere this problem is completely cureable or not...???\"Currently there is no cure for diabetes. It can, however, be controlled and managed so you can live a normal life, and in some cases reversed. Read other threads on this forum describing lifestyle changes one must make.I don't know the health laws in Nepal but elsewhere in the world to get medication requires a doctor prescribing and a pharmacy fulfilling the prescription.If you ignore getting a medical evaluation, and the frequent urination is caused by something other than diabetes - like an infection - you are facing serious health risks. There is nothing more I can say to add to what I already mentioned, your health and life is at risk, go see a doctor.",
