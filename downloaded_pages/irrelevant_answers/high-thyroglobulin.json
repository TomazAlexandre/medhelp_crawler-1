            "answer": "A one-time Tg (thyroglobulin) est is not a good indicator of thyroid cancer in someone who has a thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0It's like a one-time CA-125 for ovarian cancer.\u00a0\u00a0There is no personal reference range - the trend is often more important than the actual number.For those of us who have had our thyroid removed for cancer it is a necessary test to check for recurrence.Since you have had a hormone-fed cancer it is important for you to be closely watched for other hormone-fed cancers (ovarian and thyroid, specifically).\u00a0\u00a0 I would contact an endocrinologist who specializes in thyroids (most only deal with diabetes) and get in to see him/her.\u00a0\u00a0Take your medical records including your breast cancer information, tests, etc.\u00a0\u00a0You will probably be scheduled for ultrasounds and perhaps a CT or MRI.Don't just let a regular doctor feel your neck or look at your labs and shrug their shoulders.\u00a0\u00a0Many (okay, most) don't have a clue about thyroid cancer, thyroglobulin, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Get to a specialist.\u00a0\u00a0From one cancer survivor to another, better safe than sorry.Please take care,Utahmommapapillary carcinoma '03recurrence and RAI '06 and possibly '08three sisters with papillary carcinoma (one with spread to the breast)",

    "question": "I am just finished with breast cancer treatment and had routine lab tests done, my TSH was 0.06 (low), thyroglobulin78.8 (high), thyroglobulin antibody 1.8 (normal), Free T4 1.0 (normal), anti-TPO antibody 38 (normal).\u00a0\u00a0As youcan imagine I am wondering if this could be indicative of thyroid cancer? My regular Dr. never mentioned it,orfelt my thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0I thought she would order and Ultrasound but ordered some more thyriod blood tests in 6-8weeks.\u00a0\u00a0My oncologist wants me to have my thyroid evaluated by my regular MD.\u00a0\u00a0I am most concerned with thehigh thyroglobulin, what does that mean?Thank you for your help with this",
