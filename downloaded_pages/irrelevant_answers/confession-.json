            "answer": "Soda os honestly very very bad in large quantities. It's actually less of a risk factor to drink a large cup of coffee in the the morning rather then sodas during the day. soda is not only high in caffeine but also sugar. Studies have shown that children whose mothers drank excessive amounts of soda per day had sorter attention spans and took longer to retain basic knowledge. Not to mention chances for diabetes later in life increases drastically. If you get nauseous easily try drinking pregnancy teas. Eating smaller meals throughout the day and try to ween yourself off of sodas slowly if necessary.",

            "answer": "Do some weaning off of the caffeine...even if it tastes bad or not as good...your body is addicted to the caffeine, not the taste, right? Another bad thing is that caffeine is a diaretic, which makes you pee out all of your hydration and during pregnancy you need so so much hydration...I drink a lot of sweet tea so I switched to decaf and put less sugar and at Starbucks I used to get full caffeinated, then half caffeine and now I get decaf . I also started putting water in the fridge and I sometimes mix my juice with some water because it gives me heartburn otherwise.",
