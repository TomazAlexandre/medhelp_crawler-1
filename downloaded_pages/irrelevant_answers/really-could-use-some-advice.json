            "answer": "I'm sorry for your loss. I have had anxiety for 15 years, and this sounds like anxiety. The fact that your lost your dad 2 years from yesterday is triggering some strong emotions. Going to counciling for anxiety is great. I think therapy especially cognitive behavioral therapy really helps. Just stay positive and work on tools for your anxiety. Take care",
