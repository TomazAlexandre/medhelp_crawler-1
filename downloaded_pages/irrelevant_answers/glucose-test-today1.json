            "answer": "I gained a lot for some reason and exercised through whole pregnancy(am at 36 weeks) and had to take both. I was nervous about the 2nd test, but passed all but one of the 4 draws, which didn't have to do with my weight gain or what i ate. Just how my body was slower to break down sugar in the 2nd hour. My 1 hr fail and the draw i didn't pass were barely over what they should be if that helps.",

            "answer": "Hi mommies!! First off good luck @pattyann215. I unfortunately failed my screening an my 3hr so I'm officially diagnosed with gestational diabetes :( I'm almost 33wks and I have gained much weight at all...but as @elle30 said my body took the full 3 hrs to get back down to normal levels (so I failed the 2 middle draws). Next week I see a nutritionist for a diet (which I'm really bad at). The upside is I'm not too far from the finish line! I hope you pass...it's not the worst hung that can happen but it surely adds some stress u don't need. Good luck!",
