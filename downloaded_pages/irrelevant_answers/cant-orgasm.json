    "question": "Im a relatively healthy 20 year old male (6' 180lbs) and I am gay. I used to masturbate 1-2 times a day (dry, i just learned that its terrible for you) sometimes more depending on how bored I was (often not more than 2 times though) and it was at a fast pace. I'm kind of in between being cut and uncut, it's hard to explain but its like the doctor tried to circumsize me but didn't cut enough off so there is some extra skin. No matter what my boyfriend does, I can't bring myself to orgasm. I think it could be a sensitivity issue since I often lose my erection when he does oral (doesn't feel like much) or tries to jack me off. I took a 10 day break from masturbating/sex/porn and on the 10th day I noticed my erection was harder and felt more sensitivity from oral (not a lot though) but i still lost my erection even after actual intercourse and couldn't finish, even after 10 days.. Does anybody have an idea of what might be going on?",
