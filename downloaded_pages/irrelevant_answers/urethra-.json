            "answer": "It sounds as though you initially developed an infection beneath your foreskin that is associated with not pulling the foreskin back each day and washing the area with soap and water. This may be associated with diabetes (high blood sugar) which is something that you should have evaluated. Diabetes can also increase your chances of getting a urine infection.The way you collect your urine can affect the results. You should do a \"clean catch, midstream\" sample. This means that you should pull back the foreskin so that the head of you penis is exposed and then you should start urinating into the toilette bowl. After you pass a half a cup of urine, then start collecting some urine into the sterile jar from the lab. This will give you the most accurate collection without taking the urine from you with a needle or catheter.Bacteria in numbers less than 100,000 on a single sample collected in this manner, especially with a lack of symptoms, are unlikely to represent a true urine infection. Repeated urine cultures with low colony counts of the same bacteria increase the likelihood that you truly do have a urine infection.At this time, if you persist in having evidence of a urine infection, you need at least a renal and bladder ultrasound and possible, workup for diabetes and some might see the need for a look inside your bladder (cystoscopy).I would suggest that you see a specialist in urinary problems (urologist).S.A.Liroff, M.D.This information is provided for general medical educational purposes only.
