            "answer": "There are a number of conditions that might be a problem. I'm not a doctor, but these should be checked out. 1. You may be wearing shoes that are wrong for your feet. Try going to a specialty shoe store and get fitted by a trained specialist for at least one pair. Give them a chance and perhaps the numbness will go away. 2) You may have undiagnosed diabetes (type 1 or type 2) If you book an appointment with an endocrinologist he/she will check your blood sugars and the level of damage to your toes. If these don't work, ask the endocrinologist for other suggestions.",
