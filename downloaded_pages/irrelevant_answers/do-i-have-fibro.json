            "answer": "Nobody can diagnose you over the internet and this isn't the physicians' forum. I can tell you though if you have depression, then you can have some physical symptoms and that could include aches/pains and sleeping so much. I would consider talking to your physician about your depression; perhaps getting treated and see if you still have symptoms. If you are convinced that your physical symptoms started before your depression, then I would consider getting tested first for autoimmune conditions, thryoid problems, Sjogren's syndrome and vitamin deficiencies.",

Before I was diagnosed and treated for CFS, I used to bruise and remember once I had a bruise for over 6 months !The poster definitely needs a complete workup and her physician should probably order a complete chem panel, including glucose, sed rate, lyme disease titer and an ANA to rule out the possibility of an autoimmune disease. If all of that is negative, I would then consider ordering hormone tests and an MRI of the brain.",
