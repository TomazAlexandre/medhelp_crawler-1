            "answer": "You will be ok no matter the outcome. Gestational diabetes is rare effecting 10 to 15% of pregnancies around the world. I'm one of the few that failed and was taken very by surprise by it. I wss depressed at first and have days where it can be hard but I've found some great ways to cheat the diet a bit and it hasnt all been bad honestly. Also its common for a lot of women to fail the one hour. If you do get diagnosed know you have support and youll be ok. Add me if you want or need someone to talk to about it. Hope you pass. <3",

It's not that hard to monitor and self test everyday. I know, I'm doing it too! It's not often that moms to be will need insulin, but if you do then listen to your Dr follow their instructions and you should be fine. Stressing will get you no where and is t healthy. :)",
