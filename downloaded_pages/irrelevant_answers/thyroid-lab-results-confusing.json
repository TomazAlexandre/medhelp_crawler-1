            "answer": "With those symptoms and test results, yes I think you should start looking for an Endo that is a good thyroid doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Many Endos specialize in diabetes, rather than thyroid, so it might be worthwhile to post a message asking for a PM recommending an Endo in your area, who is a good thyroid doctor.You will need to find one that is willing to test and adjust your FT3 and FT4 levels with whatever meds are required to alleviate your symptoms, rather than just medicating you based on TSH\u00a0\u00a0levels.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms are the most important, not TSH level.This is a good article that would be worthwhile reading for you.http://www.hormonerestoration.com/Thyroid.html",
