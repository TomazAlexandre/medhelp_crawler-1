            "answer": "I went to a diabetes education class that teaches about the sliding scale and how to take your Humalog.\u00a0\u00a0However, my doc gave me a formula to use to counteract high blood sugars when not enough insulin has been taken.\u00a0\u00a0It's (bloodsugar) - 100 divided by 40.\u00a0\u00a0So, if your blood sugar is 300 you would subtract 100 to get 200.\u00a0\u00a0Divide that by 40 to get 5 units of Humalog.\u00a0\u00a0I also have a scale for when I eat.\u00a0\u00a0It's for every 15 grams of carbs I take 2 units of Humalog.\u00a0\u00a0When your blood sugar is high in the morning you would do both of these things.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, you need to talk w/ your doc about all of this because everyone is different.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest, however, that you first talk to your doc about the high blood sugars in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0He/She can adjust your Lantus so that your blood sugar will even out.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Thanks for that info. I just changed over this last week, so I'm still adjusting my dose. My doc said to start out taking 1 unit of Humalog for every 15 grams of carbs before the meal. I had never heard of the formula for the sliding scale. That could come in handy.",

    "question": "I have recently been switched to Lantus & Humalog and I have some questions. I take it in the morning. If I awake with an abnormal blood sugar (too high) I assume I would take a small dose of fast acting. Would I also take a small dose of fast acting if my blood sugar is normal, as to cover my breakfast? I know to count the carbs before the lunch meal and the dinner meal, but didn't ask about the breakfast meal.",
