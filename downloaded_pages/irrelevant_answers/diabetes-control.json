            "answer": "Reasonable meaning I dont eat the obvious junk food like chips/pop/cookies and I limit pasta and breads to 15 carb choice.\u00a0\u00a0I weigh 180 which may be the thyroid thing as I am hypo and I don't exercise like I would like to due to bone spurs in the hips. I usually eat twice a day because it is when I take my insulin. I sometimes will snack on nuts and I do drink alot of milk (2%) soon changing to skim. Sometimes I throw a banana or apple into my day. I do not believe I overeat but I do think I am not active enough. Hence the weight. The thing is I don't think I metoblize things well including my meds. I also have a real hard time always having to adjust my thyroid meds. I am also on other meds that may add to the weight.",

    "question": "There was a mix-up in my insulin medications and I decided to skip taking insulin till I seen my doctor. Now I relize this is not something I should have done but in doing so I relized that my blood sugar levels have been staying the same. In previous times when I was on Novalog 70/30 the more units I took the higher my levels went . Then I was switched to Lantus and still my levels stayed at 200-240 range with a couple in the 300. Always 200-220 in the morning. The only time I notice a change is if I don't eat after breakfast and go shopping all day! I seem to get closer to the 120 mark. I am sure it is due to the exercise shopping requires. What I am wondering is what kind of diabetic am I if insulin and oral meds are not bringing my levels under control? My diet if anything is not eating enough. I have been trying to eat like they tell me but I often don't want to eatevery 2 hours. No appetite? I like to eat when I am hungry. And I don't do the soda pop high carb thing. I eat very reasonable. I am also hypothyroid and have had a heart attack (reason?)\u00a0\u00a0with prehypertension and high cholesterol levels. Could I have some other problem besides Diabetes? For the last 6 years my A1C levels have been 7.5 to 9. something or other (can't remember).\u00a0\u00a0Thanks to any suggestions.",
