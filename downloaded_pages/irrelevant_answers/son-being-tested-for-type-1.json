            "answer": "Yes, these are symptoms of diabetes but also\u00a0\u00a0other conditions as well. The doctor is trying to figure out the cause of these symptoms. You can't just assume is diabetes. Hang in there, good luckPS when I was 17 months old I had a bad cold, my parents took me to the doctor and she told my parents to take me to the hospital inmediately. I was diagnosed with diabetes. Symptoms can be deceiving.",

            "answer": "Hey there, it seems that he does have some symptoms that point to diabetes. Is your son constantly thirsty, or does he drink a lot? Go to the bathroom often? These are signs that his blood glucose levels may be high.I myself have been diagnosed with diabetes since I was 8. Living a healthy life (more or less) as a diabetic for almost 13 years now.",

            "answer": "He does drink a lot. He drinks in the middle of the night too. The doctor came back and said that his blood sugar levels on an A1C were in the normal range. But they tested his insulin levels and they were low. The don't think that he has diabetes, but they are not positive. She said they are going to have him come in every two weeks for the next 3 months or so. If he doesn't gain weight, they are going to rerun those tests plus some others. So I guess for right now all we can do is wait. His next appointment is this Wednesday. Thank you so much for your responses. It is nice to know that, if we do eventually face this as a diagnosis, I have a place to turn.",

    "question": "I took my 8 year old son in for a Dr. Appt meant for a totally unrelated cause, and I left with him being tested for Type 1 diabetes. Being a typical mom, I am worried sick. So I figured I could get a little info here. They tested him because while at the appointment I mentioned that he seemed to have lost a lot of weight recently. I wasn't sure if maybe he was just growing taller or was getting skinnier. They measured and weighed him, and then compared it to his visit at the end of September (last time we had been there). He has lost almost 4 pounds, and he has grown two inches. He eats ALL the time! So I was shocked he had lost so much weight. He also has headaches - often. They sent him for blood and urine testing. I got a call at 9pm from the doctor saying the the sugars were okay? but there were keytones? so she wanted to run more tests. She was going to try to run more tests on the left over blood they already had. He has an appointment in two weeks for a recheck on the original reason for the appointment. I just wanted to know if these are symptoms that would likely be linked to Type 1, or is the doctor just being cautious. Thanks!",
