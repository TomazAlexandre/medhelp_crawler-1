            "answer": "Ok! Was just worried about the baby being born too early. I've been reading up on it, and a lot of people say that if your body and baby aren't ready, that usually nothing will happen. Was just worried! So is it literally a half a cup of each, or 4oz of each to make an 8oz glass?",

            "answer": "Unless you are already in early stages of labor, there is absolutely nothing you can do to induce labor. That's why even so many medical inductions in hospitals fail and end in c section.",

            "answer": "I read u can do it up to 2 times a day it doesnt have to be. And yea since your 3 cm already it wouldnt hurt to try. How many weeks are u? As long as ur at least 37 then your term so dont worry about the baby comming too soon. But if your only 30 weeks dont do it. And as for wayfunmommy she is right about if your body isnt ready it wont help but most inductions end like that because the meds dont allow you to labor properly in some cases. I know for a fact they wont induce you if your not effaced or dialated, they check that. But i have to have my second c sec in april and if i could try to self induce over medically i would try at home first for sure so theres no harm in trying as long as your past 37 weeks.",

        {
            "answer": "Yeah, I totally understand that. Obviously, a baby won't come unless your body is at least close to or fully ready. I'm definitely dilated though, and close to fully efaced. I will be exactly 37 weeks tomorrow though. That's why I was curious about going ahead and drinking that mixture. I definitely wouldn't try it if I was only 30 weeks!! Lol",

I was back and forth about trying last night, so I didn't. I think I'm going to tonight though! I was having a few contractions last night anyway, so might as well try it!! I'll keep you updated!",
