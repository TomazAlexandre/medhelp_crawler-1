    "question": "Im 5'8 and at a healthy 220lbs. Im 18wks pregnant and my Dr. keeps getting on me about not gaining any weight. I eat just as much as I used to, and I've always been a healthy eater and walk almost every day. My mom had gestational diabetes with me and my two sisters. I think im afraid I will have it too- therefore I subconsciously eat less... How am I supposed to put on just the right amount of weight? The last thing I want is to be hounded for putting on too much weight. But I want to make sure my baby is getting everything it needs.How do I slowly gain the right amount of weight?",
