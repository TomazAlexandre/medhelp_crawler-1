            "answer": "I have no idea what caused this, but if you have IBS and GERD you're certainly not healthy.\u00a0\u00a0You're not digesting your food properly, for one thing, and probably not eating the right things.\u00a0\u00a0This can be treated, and I think it's best treated naturally, as meds can make the problem chronic.\u00a0\u00a0Have you seen anyone such as a holistic nutritionist to see if you can make dietary and lifestyle changes to get past this?",

            "answer": "Turmeric is a wonderful anti-inflammatory and helpful for the liver, but it's also a hot herb and some people with GERD will be adversely affected by it if they don't take well to hot herbs.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone is different.\u00a0\u00a0As to the original poster, leaning toward vegetarian doesn't say anything about whether your diet is healthy for you or not.\u00a0\u00a0Some people do well that way, some don't.\u00a0\u00a0And you have to eat healthy foods and eat them at the right time; a lot of animal foods are healthier than a lot of vegetarian foods.\u00a0\u00a0It's what suits you best, including seemingly silly things like not eating before lying down and chewing your food thoroughly and discovering if there are foods you just can't digest.\u00a0\u00a0Guess what I'm saying is, GERD isn't a disease, it's an imbalance, and doesn't have to last a lifetime -- it isn't diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

    "question": "I suddenly just had the urge to go the bathroom and had a sharp pain shoot through my chest up to my neck. It was worse when I breathed deeply. It actually radiated to the back of my head. I went to the bathroom, everything was normal. I threw up because of the pain and I was a bit nauseous. It has now subsided but it scared pretty terribly. I've been diagnosed with IBS and GERD and have felt similar pain in my throat before.I have no headache, no problems breathing, no dizziness, no headache, I'm very coherent andcurrently trying to relax. I have not been diagnosed with any heart related problems. I'm 22, 121 lbs, fit, supposedly healthy (my doctor has said).",
