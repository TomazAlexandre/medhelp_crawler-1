            "answer": "Pain all-over is related more to polyneuropathy and it could be caused by glucose intolerance, inflammatory disease, toxicity (if you consume a lot of simple carbs you may have excess tartaric acid-a muscle toxin\u00a0\u00a0which lowers malic acid, an acid important for proper metabolic function. Raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar is the top remedy).A low carb diet, avoiding breads, pastas, sweets, sodas,sugary and starchy foods might make a notable difference. Artificial sugars should be avoided as well.Coconut oil used in cooking instead of inflammatory cooking oils helps in many different ways, since it does not promote inflammation (it is resistant to high temperatures) and it also has antifungal, antiviral, antimicrobial and antiparasitic properties.I hope this helps.Best wishes,Niko",

            "answer": "Well peripheral neuropathy is more the numbness and strange sensations. .. burning feelings too. . Is a nerve pain not a body ache. ..I don't know if this is even possibly what's wrong with you but my sister has fibromialgia.. and she aches all over.
