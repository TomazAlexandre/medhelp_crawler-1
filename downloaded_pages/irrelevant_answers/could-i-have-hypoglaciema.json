            "answer": "Rachel,Sounds to me like you may be experiencing hypoglycemia, though i certainly am not a doctor. i would advise checking as frequently as possible before your doctor appointment. He/She should be able to make sense out of your readings, a couple of day's worth should give a normal pattern of how you range.With blood issues like this knowledge is power, which is why i advised checking as completely as possible for the doctor and also write in meals and snacks also. Because it all boils down to how your body can/can't digest carbohydrates.Hope you find a program that works for you, bret",

            "answer": "Hi Rachel,Two of my daughters are hypoglycemic. One fainted a work due to low blood sugar and suffered a significant head injury when she fell. It is a real condition with real consequences, including the potential to increase insulin resistance leading to type 2 diabetes.The most common treatment for hypoglycemia is to adjust diet, and this you could try\u00a0\u00a0to see if your symptoms and BS swings get better. My daughters have learned to avoid refined sweets and juices that raise blood glucose quickly (orange juice is one of the worst. To avoid the swings, and fix\u00a0\u00a0the lows they eat protean based energy bars and nuts as snacks. This require the body to produce insulin at a much lower rate. It is the rapid overproduction of insulin in response to rapid glucose rise that causes the wild swings from low to high and back to low. Trying to correct with a sugary snacks will just repeat the cycle.It is sometimes hard to find physicians that will recognize hypoglycemia as a disease, and it is often hard to catch high or low readings in lab tests. Making your own measurements is certainly is a good step towards allowing your physician to determining whether you are hypoglycemic. To properly understand and formulate a diet that can help you verify and, if necessary, control hypoglycemia, I would recommend seeing a dietician. They are more open to recognizing and treating this condition. There are probably also a number of books on this subject that may help. Be careful to look for books on hypoglycemic diet and not just a low carb diet. The focus of weight loss books is not blood sugar control.Good luck,Larry",

            "answer": "Rachel,Your readings are generally in the normal range. But the symptoms you describe sound like hypoglycemia. And you could be missing something because of the gaps between tests.A 5 hour Glucose Tolerance Test would give you a better handle on what is happening. After doing an initial test, you consume 75 grams of glucose. Then you test every hour for the next 5 hours.For more info about the GTT see this page : http://www.endocrineweb.com/diabetes/diagnosis.html . If you have reactive hypoglycemia, you could expect to see your blood sugar levels dropping below normal levels after 3 hours.If you think that low blood sugars are an issue, ask your doctor to arrange a GTT for you.Cheers,Mark",

            "answer": "Some fluctuation is very normal, but being as low as you are all day is not. Even if your overall glucose levels average out to the low side of normal, at a glucose reading of 80, most folks start to feel crummy and when below that, may lose ability to concentrate, muscle coordination, and even reaction time, making you dangerous if you drive a vehicle. Many doctors tend to not take hypoglycemia seriously, but it can affect quality of life or even put you in danger at times, such as when driving a vehicle.The web site posted here may be very helpful to you, and the advice to try protein snacks and avoid high-carb foods is the usual advice given. Some folks find that when they start to eat lower-carbohydrate meals, the hypoglcemia make get WORSE for a few days as the body continues to over-produce insulin, but then may improve greatly as the pancreas ceases to be stimulated to produce insulin because there are fewer carbs being consumed.",

            "answer": "Rachel,Have you done the glucose tolerance test yet? It will definately clarify your thinking. And it will provide you with hard evidence to take to the doctor. Go to this page for instructions :http://www.endocrineweb.com/diabetes/diagnosis.htmlHighlight the address above, and copy & paste it into the browser address field. And press return. Doing the test is very easy. And the results show just how your body responds to a glucose load.It sounds like you are getting blood sugars readings all over the place. Be sure to wash your hands before you ***** your finger.Cheers,Mark",
