            "answer": "Just curious, do you take your temperature when this happens or are you strictly going by what someone tells you that your head feels hot to them?\u00a0\u00a0I'm just wondering because it can make a difference in how someone else's (or even your own) skin temperature feels if the person doing the touching has cold hands or poor circulation, etc.Next time this happens, I would definitely do an actual temperature reading with a good thermometer - in fact, keep track of your temperature at different times during the day for a few days and that way when you do go to the doctor, you can show them what you've documented - it will make it easier for them to figure out what's causing the temperature fluctuations.But I do agree that you need to be seen by a doctor, not only for the temperature, but also for the abdominal pain.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!White blood cells in urine means there is some infection. Ideally you should ask for a culture sensitivity of urine. This will tell you what organism is causing the infection and what antibiotic will kill it permanently. Please do not take any antibiotic without this test because if the organism is not sensitive to the antibiotic, it will only sit quietly for some time and then flare up again.Also get tested for diabetes.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "If you do have a kidney stone, it'll depend on the size and location of the stone as to whether they will just wait and see if you pass it or not.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes instead of surgery, they can do a lithotripsy procedure that uses sound waves to help break up the stone so it's easier to pass.\u00a0\u00a0My father is very prone to kidney stones and has had this procedure several times.Also, if it is a kidney stone and they determine that you also are prone to \"make\" them, they may put you on a medication that will help your body to not make so much uric acid, which is something that many (but not all) kidney stones are made of.\u00a0\u00a0My dad also takes this type of medication and it has greatly reduced his number of kidney stones.Best of luck and keepus posted.",
