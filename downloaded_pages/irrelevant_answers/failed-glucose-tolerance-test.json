            "answer": "I failed my 1 hour glucose test too...I was an 8.1 and the cutoff was 7.8, so I had to do the 2 hour glucose test. I ended up throwing up halfway through the 2 hour glucose test and the doc sent me to the diabetes counsellor for precautionary measures. After about 2 weeks of testing my blodd te doc let me retake the 2 hour test and my levels came back perfect and i dont have to see the diabetes doc anymore!I had eaten something the morning of my 1 hour test which could have thrown me off but I had to fast for at least 10 hours before the 2 hour test, and I made sure to cut back on any sweets about a week beofre I retook the 2 hour test!Good Luck!",

    "question": "Last week I took my glucose tolerance and I just found out that I failed it, but a lot. My blood sugar was 160 and the cut off is 130. So, now I have to take another, more rigorous test this week. My issue is that for the last 2-3 weeks I've had quite a sweet tooth. I've been craving fruit, pies, pastries you name it - and I've been eating them.My doctor said that I can't give myself gestational diabetes by eating sweets, but could something I ate the night before the test, like a bowl of cherries, have given the first test a false positive? The morning before the test I didn't eat any sugar, I just had eggs and sausage for breakfast. I can't quite remember what I ate the day before.Does anyone know the chances of me failing the second screening based on the numbers from my first test? I'm really scared. I failed by a lot! I'm planning to lay off the sweets for the weekend and then take the test on Monday. My hope is that it will make the second test as accurate as possible if I'm not indulging in sweets the day before. I don't plan on indulging in them in the future anyway.",
