    "question": "For more than a year now I have been struggling with diarrhea and pain on the upper right side of the abdomen. I have done several tests and scans. Nothing other than hypertension and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was found. I have made several treatments to stop these symptoms with no real improvement.On the last 3 months situation has gotten worse. A\u00a0\u00a0painless lump on the right side of the neck has developed. The abdominal pain that usually is dull, radiates now to the back. Sometimes, especially at night the pain is\u00a0\u00a0stabbing and too strong to be able to sleep. I lost appettite due to being with nausea all the time, especially when the meal contains fatty food.I also have been on the last week with constant dizziness, and now 2 days ago my eyes started to turn yellow.I have done more tests 3 weeks ago and nothing else has been found other than I probably now have diabetes.I do not know what else to do. Any help would be much appreciated!",
