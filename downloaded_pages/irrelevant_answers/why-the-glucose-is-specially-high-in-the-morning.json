            "answer": "I am not a physician but the mom f a type 1 diabetic and a volunteer.The morning blood sugar is a fasting blood sugar and tells the doctor how your body reacts with out food.\u00a0\u00a0The body releases hormones (growth etc.), while the body is at rest. Most hormones are glucose based and can affect blood sugar that is why when women menstruate and children have growth spurts their blood sugars and insulin dosages need to be changed.I would suggest you ask your doctor what blood sugar range he would like you to be in and what you could do to be in better control.",

            "answer": "Yumin,\"Fasting blood sugar\" is just the blood sugar reading when a person is fasting.\u00a0\u00a0\"Fasting\" means nothing to eat or drink for 8-12 hours.When we do a blood test in the morning, just as we wake up, we call that a fasting blood test.\u00a0\u00a0It is common for our fasting numbers to be a little higher than at other times of the day, as has already been explained.Perhaps you can find some good books written in your native language to help you understand some of the many small details of this disease.\u00a0\u00a0I admire your ability to communicate so well in a different language, and yet there is the chance that you can learn even more by using resources in multiple languages.Hope this helps.",
