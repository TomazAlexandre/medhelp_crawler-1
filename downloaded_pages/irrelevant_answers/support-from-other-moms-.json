    "question": "I'm 19 wks and 4 days long. I weight 151lbs...n I'm 5'3.\u00a0\u00a0I had a accident in 08 which led me to have constant low back pain...now I also have gestational diabetes. This has been a transition for me but in order to have a normal pregnancy I have to change a lot of my eating habits and check my sugar levels every day.But the issue at the moment....Two days ago while I slept I endure this sharp cramp on my leg which has led me to two days of misery. Its difficult to walk and go up and down the stairs for me. I need some help or advice on how to relieve this and find out if there are any mothers out there who are in the same shoes... I love my husband but sometimes I don't feel he understands what I'm going through even though I explain it to him. But boys would be boys!! Thank you xo",
