            "answer": "Uhhhhhhh... that is definitely CRAZY!!! Does not make one smidgen of sense. She needs to go to a different hospital. I'm sure she wants HER doctor to delivery her baby but this could be a matter of live and death. At 5 cm dilated you are considered to be in labor. She should be at the hospital, not at home unless she wants a home birth!",

            "answer": "I can maybe see not breaking her water, which is odd since she is so far along, but I would think they would at least keep her in the hospital to monitor her!!!",

            "answer": "she goes to a clinic set up within the hospital, so whatever doctor is on call will be the one to deliver her baby, which can be between 6 different doctors!!! they told her to go home and wait it out until her water breaks on its own. i told her to go the the ER of a different hospital, but she's afraid to since they won't have her records or birth plan. im just hoping everything goes well for her and my unborn neice since...thank you for reassuring me im not insane in wanting her to disagree with the 'doctors'",

    "question": "this is in regard to my sister-in-law...she is currently 37weeks...since she was 36 weeks she was 2cm and 70% effaced...she went to the hospital yesterday b/c she was having contraction 2-10 minutes apart that began in her back and came across her stomach. she is now 5cm yet still only 70% effaced. she has gestational (sp) diabetes and at her last ultrasound they said she had a lot of amnio fluid...now this week they said they wanted to do an amnio test to ensure the baby's lungs are developed. due to the fact that she is so far along and has the diabetes, im sure the lungs are just fine. what i dont get is this is her 2nd child(she also has gest.diabetes with her 1st baby), she delivered a baby girl at 36wks before and my neice was just fine, so why push the amnio now? the hospital actually sent her home and said...and i quote \"we dont break waters on weekends\"...if they are so worried about all the amnio fluid and how big the baby is, why wouldn't they want it out since she is in labor? any answers would help!!!",
