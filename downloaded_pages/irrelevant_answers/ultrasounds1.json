            "answer": "They usually do only 2 or 3 unless you have some kind of complication... my last pregnancy I had 4 (an extra one because I switched doctors).... this pregnancy I've had a bunch--- too many to count--- they were doing monthly ultrasounds because I had high blood pressure and they thought baby would be growth restricted since she was measuring smaller than normal and that is common with woman with high blood pressure.... then I went off that medicine and got diagnosed with gestational diabetes at 29 weeks... joy! So now they are doing growth scans to make sure she doesnt get too big... its been a roller coaster with this pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I have ultrasounds every 2 weeks until 36 weeks and then it will change to twice a week until she is here. .. I'm 33 weeks and quite frankly I am SICK of going to the doctor",
