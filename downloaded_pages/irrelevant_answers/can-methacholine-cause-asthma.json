            "answer": "Sorry that you are feeling so pooly. From what I understand, methacholine will trigger an asthma flareup in people who do have asthma, causing a drop in peak flow of 20%. If you don't have asthma your reaction will be less, causing a drop less than 20%.When I took the test I was hypersensitive for awhile afterward but returned to normal eventually. I did test positive for asthma so my experience with methacholine may be different than yours. Methacholine is an irritant so some reaction is to be expected I suppose.I hope you're feeling better.",

    "question": "I'm a 29 YOF. My doctor wanted me to take the methacholine chalIenge becasue I do, occasionally, have breathing difficulties.\u00a0\u00a0I have type 1 diabetes and sometime wonder if I get confused with my body trying to release the acidity build up in my blood (DKS symptoms) or if I am really having a hard time breathing.\u00a0\u00a0I took the methochline challenge test yesterday and my readings were wonderful (well over 100% before and after).\u00a0\u00a0I did have some difficulties during the test, but I suppose nothing like someone who is truly ashmatic.\u00a0\u00a0The nurse said that I did wonderfully through all 6 steps of the mehocholine inhalations.\u00a0\u00a0Although during the test, after and a now a day later I still have tightening of the chest and my throat is swollen.\u00a0\u00a0How long does it take to recover from this testing - will my lungs & throat be the same again?\u00a0\u00a0Could it be that this test is causing me to develop & or make my symptoms worse even a day after?\u00a0\u00a0The nurses say that things are fine & my breathing is wonderful.\u00a0\u00a0If things are so great then why am I feeling this way?Thank you for you valued time!",
