            "answer": "Hi.At this point , it will not be wise to assume that these visual symptoms are due to a migraine episode.I suggest that you seek immediate consult with a neurologist for a thorough assessment.When was the last time you had a cranial CT scan done? I suggest that you discuss having a CT scan or cranial MRI done to rule out any intracranial involvement.You had previous episodes of headaches and neurologic deficits in the past. With a new onset symptom, prompt assessment is necessary.Just a few questions:Do you have any underlying systemic problem like\u00a0\u00a0diabetes or hypertension?Any intake of medications?Any thyroid or cardiac\u00a0\u00a0problems?Were your clotting factors thoroughly assessed before?",

    "question": "I have had recent spells of my visual field picture being chopped up into many different smaller frames but none of them link, like a jigsaw where the pieces don't fit. It then becomes worse and\u00a0\u00a0I cannot seem to make sense if what I see at all, my brain does not compute what my eyes are seeing.I do not recognize my surroundings.I fixed the paddock gate by feel with much concentration and found I couldn't see which way was back to the house. I found myself crawling along the ground as I think it must have felt safer than being on my feet, feeling somewhat unsteady with my heart racing too.I finally worked out which way to go and with much concentration and made it back. Afterwards I felt shaky and a bit nauseous. I am aware when this happens I am outside and that there has been an initial sensitivity to the early morning sunlight slanting into my eyes.There was no limb weakness or tingling or headache or blurring of vision. I am 64, have had many standard migraines in the past with the very occasional zig zag aura but none for many years, just the occasional tension headache with tight neck and back muscles. I see a chiro for this with much help from him.I had one 2 minute spell 20 years ago of losing power of arm, face and speech and many spells of dizziness since I was a child, but especially around menstrual and menopausal times. I have had tinnitus for 16 years.Recently I have had a numb feeling in the side of my face, the back of my upper arm and the back of my thigh. When I decided this was stress it immediately it disappeared!! I am particularly stressed at the moment. I am wondering if this strange visual disconnection is migrainous in origin please???",
