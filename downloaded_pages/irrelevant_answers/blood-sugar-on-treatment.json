            "answer": "You didn't indicate whether both of your readings were based on fasting glucose but I assume the 88 was. If your BS got to the 400s you have a problem and would probably be classified as a diabetic. Your body either doesn't make enough insulin or the insulin your body does make is ineffective or both. If I were you I would take this seriously. If you do not have a glucose monitor you should get one immediately and begin to test your blood before and after meals and when you awaken and before you go to sleep. That is really the only way you can know what is going on with your blood sugar. Your doctor can give you a script for one and I believe that it will be free. The test strips would fall under your copay if you have insurance but they can be costly depending on your copay and the frequency at which you test. I could take oral meds but I choose to inject insulin because I believe it has a greater effectiveness and it doesn't have the side effects of oral meds. I use a pen where you dial up the dose and the needle is so tiny that if you have any fat on your body you wouldn't even feel the injection. Diabetes and insulin resistance are negative predictors for a positive outcome of HCV treatment but I reached SVR and took insulin throughout my treatment so it can be done. But, you must be aware of where you are in terms of blood sugar, not only for the treatment but for your overall health. The people that don't take this disease seriously are the ones who make up the statistics - cardiac event, macular degeneration, limb loss, kidney dysfunction and the list goes on. Give yourself the advantage of knowing what your blood sugar is and how various foods influence it and if it is out of range treat it with something. I wish you luck. Mike",

    "question": "My blood sugar went up to 400 or something when I started tx in Sept. My Dr. wanted to put me on the oral drug for high sugar but it is hard on your liver. I decided that I had to get it under control!(I didn't need another med) I gave up all sugar in Oct. and watch carbs and fats also. My last test was 88. I wonder will it straighen out after I complete tx or will I always be predisposed to it. I've read alot about metabolic disorder lately and how it affects tx. If it is under control does it still affect svr chances?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just wondering....",
