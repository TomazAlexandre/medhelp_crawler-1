            "answer": "Hello,Without examination confirmation of a diagnosis is tough but urge of frequent urination can be due to increased intake of fluids or diabetes mellitus.Other possibilities are glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis(inflammation of the kidneys),urinary tract infection,hypercalcemia,hypokalemia(low potassium),hyperthyroidism,hyperparathyroidism,diuretic drugs and benign hyperplasia of the prostate(in elderly males).In my opinion, investigations like kidney functions, blood sugar levels, ultrasound lower abdomen(already ruled out kidney causes) ,intravenous pyelography ,prostate specific antigen blood test,thyroid function tests and cystoscopy may be needed to confirm a diagnosis.I sincerely advise you to consult a urologist or nephrologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.Kind regards.",

            "answer": "Hello Doctor,I mentioned a cytoscopy to a urologist once and she laughed at me, because she said that all my previous urinalysis tests have never been indicative of anything. I recently had an abdomen and pelvis MRI so that will hopefully help shed some light on what is going on down there.Thanks for your time.",

    "question": "It seems like everytime I drink something I have to pee. WHY? It never used to be like this up to 9 months ago and prior. Have my muscles just gone weak down there? I used to be able to drink a whole bunch of liquids and just urinate after a couple of them, as it stands now though, I would probobaly have to pee after the first drink. I mean regular things too, not alcohol (which I haven't drank in about 10 months).The urologist has done a urinalysis and says that things are normal. An abdominal ultrasound says that my kidneys are normal in size. What can be the cause behind all this? I'm currently not on any medication, and haven't been for about 3 months. I do have a varicocele (really thick veins) in my scrotum. Would that be affecting how much I urinate? If not, what other possible causes can there be? I appreciate your reading.I am 24, 5'10, male, 145 lbs",
