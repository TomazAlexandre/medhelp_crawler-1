            "answer": "How do you know you are not hypothyroid? From a lab test or from symptoms? There is a growing movement in thyroid treatment that the TSH is not a particular good measure of thyroid function, and that patients should be dosed by symptoms. My doctor is dosing me by symptoms, and I feel so much better than I did when my previous doc was dosing by labs......just a thought. Are you having hypo symptoms?",

He also sent me for a bone densitometry which came back as low bone density.\u00a0\u00a0He is also the doctor who said he thought my Graves was in remission and ordered me off of the Methimazole. My regular endo. has me take 3-4 blood tests when I go for my thyroid testing so I am confident that he is correct about my thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0It has always tended to be high anyway and never low.\u00a0\u00a0I will continue to go for my regular thyroid checks.\u00a0\u00a0Are there any other tests I should have in regards to the Gastroparesis?\u00a0\u00a0I have had so many symptoms over the past year that may or may not be related to each other.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your comments.",
