            "answer": "Hello.Have you repeated any blood tests? And did you have this burning sensation earlier? There is probably a coincidence that this has happened after the event. Studies have shown that most of the herpes infections go without symptoms for a long time.You must also consider other causes that might cause neuropathy. Rule out diabetes.Regards",
