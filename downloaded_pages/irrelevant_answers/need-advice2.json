            "answer": "Hi,Your blood sugar is high.\u00a0\u00a0How old are you?\u00a0\u00a0Are you overweight? Do you exercise? Do you have any family history of diabetes?metformin is usually the first line of treatment for type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0For type 1 (there is also adult onset type 1), the treatment is insulin.So, if you answered yes to the overweight, it is possible that metformin (combined with active lifestyle, low carbohydrate diet, and weight loss will work).If you are slim, active, and no family history of type 2, I would be going straight to that specialist.Monitor your blood sugar fasting, 2 hours after each meal.\u00a0\u00a0This will help you to adjust what you eat and to see the effect of the meds and your efforts.\u00a0\u00a0I'd say give t he metformin and low carb etc. a shot for 2 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0If in that time your sugar levels are coming down\u00a0\u00a0(may not yet be on target, but should be on the way there) then you are on the right track.\u00a0\u00a0If not, go see if you can get put on insulin.Note:\u00a0\u00a0 Truely normal fasting levels shouldd be < 100Truely normal 2 hours after eating should be < 120 (ideally also < 100).You could send me a message if you'd like some links to a great support group, and also a fabulous website that will give you a great intro to diabetes and managing it.\u00a0\u00a0We are not allowed to link here in the public forum.",

            "answer": "At times it's hard to believe you have come down with a serious disease, especially when you feel OK. Diabetes is a silent disease where many people do not have symptoms, then whammo, a doctor's visit and test reveal that you have it. The latest figure is 26 million Americans have been diagnosed with diabetes, up 1.8 million from the previous year and the number is steadily growing larger each day.The best things you can do for yourself is:1.) Listen and follow your doctor's instructions.2.) Take your medication as instructed.3.) Educate yourself [Google search] on this disease - how to treat, how to self test, what you can do to help yourself lower your blood sugar levels [medication alone will not do it].4.) Read other forum posts for suggestions.5.) Reread and understand what supersally posted. If not, ask questions.Diabetes becomes a progressive disease that will lead to neuropathy and possible amputation if ignored. If your levels remain above 200 mg/dl you WILL be put on insulin. Yours is 300 mg/dl, three times above the normal limit. That is dangerous.",
