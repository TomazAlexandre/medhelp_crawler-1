No immediate subependymoma, S. left temporal lobe white matter lesions are evident. There is no evidence of diffusion restriction. There is no evidence of pathologic enhancement. The venricles, cisterns and sluci appear normal. There is no evidence of mass or hemorrhage.There is mild maxillary and ethmoid sinus mucosal thickenning. No air-fluid levels are identified.IMPRESSION: SEVERAL NONSPECIFIC FOCI OF INCREASED SIGNAL WITHIN THE PEROVENTRICOLAR WHITE MATTER. NO COMPELLING SUGGESTION OF DEMYELINATING DISEASE.
