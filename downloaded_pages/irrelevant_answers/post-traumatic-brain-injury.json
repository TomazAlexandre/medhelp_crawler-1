            "answer": "As you are aware it is not uncommon for individuals who have had severe head trauma to have cognitive difficulties. However, if there has been a recent change, then I agree it should be evaluated. The treatable forms of dementia should be excluded by checking thyroid function, vitamin B12, and a test for syphylis (RPR). I think formal neruopsychological testing would be appropriate to define the areas which he is having difficulties in. Also, if brain imaging has not been performed, it should be considered.The tingling in his toes and fingers could be related to a peripheral neuropathy, which is a dying back of the nerves. A EMG test may be useful to clarify this possibility. Common causes for peripheral neuropathy include: diabetes, thyroid disease, or B12 deficiency.I hope these explanations help you. Good Luck",

            "answer": "mlyn,there is a hormone deficiency that can result from a traumatic head injury. Its called growth hormone deficiency. The somatrophs in the pituitary gland are extremely sensitive to damage and it is common to get this kind of problem with a head injury.i know many patients being treated for this that have had head injuries.this is a treatable disease.symptoms include lack of concentration, brain fog, fatigue, and depression (and more).i urge you to do some research on this so that you can see if he has this.The neuro MD suggested thyriod tests and tests for B12 and peripheral neuropathies.in addition-- a IGF-1 test should be done to see if he has low GH.With growth hormone deficiency, the peripheral neuropathy can be related as well as the b12 deficiency. a thyriod problem could also tell you that the problem is in the pituitary gland-- where GHD stems from.to start you off researching this subject go to:hgfound.orgmagicfoundation.orggrowthhormonedeficiency.orgat the hgfound.org website there is an adult internet support group you can join and there are members that have had head injuries and are being treated for this deficiency.good luck",

    "question": "My husband had a severe head injury in 1979.He was in a coma for 3 weeks. Since then he has had other concussions. He bumps his head as though his sense of space is faulty. He recoverd with some residuals but continued to function at his profession for a few years after which he resigned his position and worked as a salesman until 1999. He is experiencing trouble concentrating. He has had trouble finding words since the accident but that is getting worse. His cognitive abilities are getting worse. He gets sweats, intermittedly, night or day and has tingling in his hands and feet,also intermitedly.He is charming, works out regularly, and plays golf. He is fit.He had a series of tests last year at the U of FL, Gainsville. He did not have Alzhiemer's at that time.I am very concerned. We consulted a neurologist rec: by the U of FL. He hints at Alzeimer,s, ignores any other cause and has ordered cognitve tests. Can there be other reasons for my husband,s symptons?",
