            "answer": "Hi,The two main causes of chronic kidney disease are diabetes and high blood pressure. Glomerulonephritis,inherited kidney diseases,\u00a0\u00a0congenital conditions and infection may also be responsible. A lot of studies\u00a0\u00a0 have linked soda\u00a0\u00a0to diabetes. Though drinking soda will not directly cause diabetes, it adds extra calories to the diet that may cause weight gain, increasing the risk for developing diabetes. Lifestyle modification and healthy diet can significantly lower the risk of diabetes and other chronic conditions including\u00a0\u00a0CKD. Hope this helps. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I am 57, was diagnosed with stage 3 CKD last July (the end of June my eGFR was 46). I am a non-drinker, hardly take otc pills ever. Even when I have chronic pain. But since my early 20's I started drinking Pepsi, for about 20 years and then Dr. Pepper for the last 12 or so. I hardly ever drank water, maybe 20 ounces a day (mostly during the night).Could flooding my body with pop ever day have caused my CKD?My lowest BP was 100/62 and the highest was 132/80 in the past 12 months, with most of my BP's falling in the 120's/78-80's range.\u00a0\u00a0I am over weight. Have not used salt since 1974. The past year I have almost stop eating beef and pork. Beef I have maybe once or twice a month and pork maybe once a week.",
