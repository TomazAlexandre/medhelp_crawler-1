            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Iron deficiency is the commonest cause of hair loss. Iron deficiency can be due to poor intake or poor absorption or due to hidden loss from bleeding as is seen in UTI and gut problems like IBS. The cause of anemia has to be found out by various blood tests. Iron replacement along with diet rich in iron and hemoglobin should be given. Please consult a hematologist if iron deficiency is detected. Hair loss can also be due to dandruff, dermatitis, shampoos, oils, soaps, dust and dirt etc. Thyroid disorders and diabetes too could be a cause. Insomnia, stress and anxiety along with poor diet and excess of caffeine too can be the cause.\u00a0\u00a0I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0In your case it can be iron deficiency, thyroid or diabetes or insomnia due to stress and anxiety.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
