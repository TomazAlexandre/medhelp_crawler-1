    "question": "Since my DCR with insertion of Crawford and Jones tubes in Jan, I have had constant infection. 10 days ago I had sinus surgery to drain maxillary sinus. That worked for 9 days. The infection returned. I've been on 5 different antibiotics since Jan surgery. Is it possible that I'm allergic to the tubes?",
