            "answer": "Hi!If the site where your teeth were pulled out is still bleeding then you need to get a bleeding time and a clotting time test done. Also, your dentist would stuff in a pack to give pressure to stop the bleeding. If it is still painful, it may be due to the exposed nerve endings. Please discuss this with your dentist. You may also need anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce both pain and inflammation. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
