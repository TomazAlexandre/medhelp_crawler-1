You would be better to go to the \"Liver Disorders forum I have put below.From what i know of NASH and NAFLD(fatty liver ) there is no cure per say,other than first and foremost to lose weight if you are overweight,make sure diabetes is under control,exercise regularly.no alcohol and eat a healthy diet. I also believe your doc is correct in saying there is no cure by meds.Hope that helpsWILL",
