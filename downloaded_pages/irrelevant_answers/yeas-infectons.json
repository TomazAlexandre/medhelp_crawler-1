    "question": "my question has a few parts. First I was tested for Hiv at least 4 weeks after exposure (unprotected oral sex, protected vaginal sex)probably longer but I cant remember exactly. 4 weeks later my wife was tested. Both were negitive. Since she has had multible yeas infectons (around 6 or 8 in the past year) treated by cream and months of difleucan. After months of symptom free while on difleucan the symptoms came back 1 month after last pill was taking , she went to gyno and was diagnosed as yeast infection. Was told that alot of things could cause this including hiv.No sex outside of the relationship has happend except that which was mentioned. They took blood from her to \"run tests\" which I think include hiv and this has started my mind wondering.Should I be concerned about HIV ?",
