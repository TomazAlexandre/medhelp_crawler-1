    "question": "Hi, I am a teen who has been experiencing some symptoms and am not sure if it is diabetes or if I am over reacting. I had constant thirst and urination which ended last week. Now I am just thirsty yet get nauseated when I eat or drink. I have lost two pounds and experience fatigue and dizziness. Money is tight right now and I don't want to waste money on a doctor if I am over reacting. Since I am not using the restroom and not as thirst because of the neausa I am uncertain that it is diabetes. I can't eat anymore without feeling sick and tired after, yet I do get extremely hungry. Please, what is wrong with me?",
