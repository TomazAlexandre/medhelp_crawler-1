            "answer": "The A1C is merely an average of the blood sugars over a period of time of 2-3 months. Your A1C definitely doesn't reflect the range you describe of 89 to 130. Sometimes it seems as though it isn't accounted for exactly, by the daily numbers but yours is pretty far off. Could it be that the period of time included a time before you got your blood sugars into range to account for the higher average?As for what you can do to get your blood sugars down, you mention the meds you take but not the other important other things you need to do to manage Type 2 which is maintain a healthy BMI (weight), exercise and reduce your carb intake.",
