            "answer": "The first things I'd recommend are that you get your thyroid tested to insure proper function.\u00a0\u00a0Get the following tests (and don't settle for less): TSH, Free T3 and Free T4.\u00a0\u00a0These will determine if you have hypothyroidism.You should also get your blood sugar levels tested.\u00a0\u00a0I'd recommend a blood glucose and an A1c test.\u00a0\u00a0This will help determine if you have, or are at risk of type II diabetes.Once those are determined, you should start out by making very simple changes to your diet and/or exercise.\u00a0\u00a0For diet, maybe start out drinking water instead of sodas or fruit juice.\u00a0\u00a0Eat carrot/celery sticks instead of a candy bar or pastry.\u00a0\u00a0Switch to whole grain breads, pastas and limit servings/day.\u00a0\u00a0Just a few suggestions to start with.For exercise - park further from the entrance, when you shop so you have to walk further.\u00a0\u00a0Try yoga, which takes considerable concentration and will help strengthen your core muscles and\u00a0\u00a0help you breathe better.\u00a0\u00a0I don't recommend strenuous exercise right off the bat.\u00a0\u00a0Start slow with a few minutes of walking (30 if you can, but less, if not), light yoga, etc until you build muscles and can tolerate more.You didn't get obese all at once, you can't expect to lose the weight all at once, so just take it slow and easy; one step at a time.",
