Or what else it could mean?\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a skinny person to begin with,\u00a0\u00a0I've got a little extra fluff but not super big... Maybe that causes me to measure big?\u00a0\u00a0I have glucose test this Thursday when I'm 28 weeks followed by an appt with my obgyn.\u00a0\u00a0I had a glucose test at 14 weeks and all was good.",
