            "answer": "My daughter is 4 and she was a easy pregnancy and good labor. Long but good. I'm almost 28 weeks with a boy and my goodness my pelvic bome hurts all the time.\u00a0\u00a0Your bones are softening for labor so it will hurt more down there plus the weight of your uterus and your baby pushing down doesn't help either. I haven't gained weight as well. I failed the first test for gd and failed the second too but 2 out of 3 tests were normal so my doctor isn't too concerned other than talk to the dietition. I got the call and just broke down and cried. For the gd just do what you need to do to make sure you and the baby are both healthy.",

            "answer": "I was shocked when I got the call but my family reassured me if he was really concerned he would have asked me to come in asap and start medication but he didn't and just told me to keep eating how I am. Hope everything goes well for you too and you have a smooth labor. Well as smooth as labor can be",

            "answer": "I definitely have more pressure with my second than I did with my first. Try some pelvic tilts--they really help to alleviate pelvic pain and can help baby shift to a more comfy position. I'm also waiting for glucose test results. Wishing you the best!",

            "answer": "I had GD with my first and I was insulin dependant. It did not affect my labor. I would have done it without an epidural if it hadn't been 100% back labor and the fact I had been up for 3 days. Natural birth with 1hr pushing (due to het being face-up and not wanting to flip over)",
