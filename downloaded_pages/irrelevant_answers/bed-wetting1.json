            "answer": "Sorry for the tardy response.All I can do is relate my early experiences with diabetes and frequent urination (polyurea) to you. Just prior to being oficially diagnosed a diabetic I had a marked increase in frquency of urinations during the day time and I would have to get up at least 3-4 times during the night. On one occasion I did wet the bed and suffered the same embarrasment that you said you felt.You should be examined by a physician to see if you are a diabetic or if there are any other problems that might contribute to your urination problems. I can tell you that when I got my diabetes under controll I also gained control of my frequent urinations and had no more bed wetting incidents.Good Luck and let us know how you are doing.",

            "answer": "HUH? Your post is contradictory. First you say, \"I haven't been diagnosed with diabetes yet but I am over weight and don't always eat properly.\" Then the very next sentence you say, \"I have had a history of hypoglycemia...\" Was this or is this history self diagnosed?As you may have read bed wetting in adult diabetes is rare/uncommon and requires you to be evaluated by a doctor.",

(Neither she nor I could figure out what that problem was,)Anyway, you need to check with your physician.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetic or not, if you suffer Sleep Apnea you need to be checked.\u00a0\u00a0Don't be afraid or ashamed to admit the problem to the doctor, they've heard everything I have found!!!Good Luck,Anita",

            "answer": "Just to let ya'll know.... Diabetes is High and Low Sugar! You can be hypoglycemic without being diagnosed as a full diabetic. I know I was one of those people. I now have type 2 and am apparently one step from type 1. I am here on this page cause I too have been experiencing bed wetting and it is getting worse. Docs have put me through tests and none so far will give me an explination(sp?) as to why I do this crap all of a sudden. Was hoping to find better answers online. Anyhow, just a lil diabetic info to those whom don't know the difference.",

            "answer": "I'm sorry but there is no such thing as \"type 2 one step away from type 1\". Your type does not change. You can be type 2 and become insulin dependent over time but you remain type 2. They are very different conditions, type 2 is characterized by insulin resistance, type 1 is an autoimmune disorder in which your body produces little or no insulin. There are, however, some people diagnosed as adults who were initially misdiagnosed as type 2 due to age but who are, in fact, something called LADA/1.5. They are basically type 1's but with a slower loss of insulin production. (I'm one of those)",
