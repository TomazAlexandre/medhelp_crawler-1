Protein has lesser impact on blood sugars even though it does break down to relase some sugar, and healthy fats do not affect blood sugars (healthy fats are naturally occuring unprocessed fats and will include animal fats, cold pressed nut oils, including coconut, olive oil, butter, cream).Exercise also helps to reduce insulin resistance.Hope this helps",
