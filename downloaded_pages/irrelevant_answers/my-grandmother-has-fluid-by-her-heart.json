            "answer": "Pericardial effusion has many causes, and the tests she\u2019s going to have are to determine the cause.Did your grandmother get any infection recently? Does she complain from any chronic medical condition like diabetes and hypertension? Was the cause of her hysterectomy a cancer uterus? What is her kidneys status?All these questions need to be answered to determine the underlying cause of her pericardial effusion. In addition, she is supposed to have echo done to see the amount of the fluid to decide whether it can be removed medically or if she needs invasive procedures to remove the excessive fluid.I hope this has been of some help. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask any further questions. I will do my best to answer you.",
