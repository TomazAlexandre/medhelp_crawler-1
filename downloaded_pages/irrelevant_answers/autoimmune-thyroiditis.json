And from what I have read, one will be dominate over the other for a period of time, then the other will dominate for a while.\u00a0\u00a0They both, or I should say symptoms/side effects, do not appear at the same time nor simultaneously.Far as I know, they\u00a0\u00a0do not know the why or what causes the auto/immune system to attack, however they are getting close for autoimmune diabetes. I have not read up on this in a long time nor know if there is any new info.I checked the Autoimmune Forum and did't seen anything regarding Graves' or Hashi, but I only looked on page one.GLJanuary is Thyroid Awareness Month, a month when various organizations put together informational efforts to help us all learn more about thyroid disease here in the U.S.January is National Graves Disease Awareness MonthNational Graves' Disease Awareness Week 1/7 thr 1/13",

It is a polar end diagnosis--Graves--the other end of the spectrum is Hashimoto's--so the two are not together at one time.It is at the top--the forum covers it but a lot of people don't think of Hash and Graves as particularly autoimmune--they focus on the gland itself.",
