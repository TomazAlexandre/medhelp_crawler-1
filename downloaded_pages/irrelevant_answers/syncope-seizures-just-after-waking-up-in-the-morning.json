My episodes have all happened after I've been awake for a few minutes. Usually I've already walked up and down stairs. Three of them have happened while I was sitting down.",

    "question": "23 year-old male. Diabetic. I had my first episode on August 1st. I was sitting on my couch just after waking up. I apparently slumped over on the couch and was non-responsive. My parents called an ambulance. I woke up while being put into the ambulance feeling fine. At the emergency room they took my blood sugar and at that point I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. After getting a head CT and it being normal they just prescribed me something for my blood sugar and released me. They just figured I had passed out because of a combination of having 300+ blood sugar count and having a late and exhausting night with few hours sleep. Everything is fine, until 4 weeks later on my way to the bathroom after just waking up I just drop to the floor. Ambulance comes again. This time I come to on the floor with the paramedics in the room. They take my blood sugar, it's fine. (around 150) I'm taken to the emergency room. Same thing, they can find nothing wrong with me and I'm released. These episodes have happened once every few weeks since then. I've stopped having anyone call an ambulance unless I'm visibly injured. (Which I haven't been) My blood sugar count is always normal. I have an EEG and an appointment scheduled with a Neurologist for December. In total I've had 6 episodes, they only occur within the first 15-30 minutes after waking up in the morning and always spaced weeks apart. Anyone familiar with these symptoms?",
