            "answer": "rapid weight gain is thought to contribute to a risk factor for GD, but like sehale said, it appears to be mostly either in your genes to get it or not, and a family history of GD can raise your risk significantly.Sprite is better than pepsi, and on that note coke is slightly better than pepsi too because it has slightly less sugar.You can have soda, pretty much ANY type of soda, in moderation. The goal is to keep your \"junk sugar\" intake as low as possible, and keep your caffeine intake moderate (less than 200mg a day on average depending on your OB - most sodas with caffeine have 20-40mg per 12oz, so do the math to figure out the max number you should drink a day depending on your soda of choice).The biggest thing with sodas is to just be aware, and avoid diet soda :-).",
