            "answer": "Hi,Many people feel unwell during that test because the glucose load is so high, but it is difficult to know if you felt strange because you went very high, or because your body overcompensated and brought your levels down too fast. You need some blood glucose readings to know for sure. You can try checking your sugars on your own after high carb meals to see what readings you get. If they are higher than 200, or lower than 60, or they drop very fast( e.g from 180 to 80 over 5 minutes), that would explain some of your symptoms and you should speak to your doctor about what needs to be done.Take care.",

    "question": "I just had a 3 hour glucose tolerance test. After coming home, a wave of heart pounding sweats and shaking came over me--I thought I was going to pass out. I am being tested because my fasting glucose came back alittle high. I am 54 and had gestational diabetes and my father has type 2. Why did this test have this affect on me.\u00a0\u00a0This will happen to me several hours after having only carbs, but this was very severe.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for any info on this, Lynn",
