He's noticed the difference in my cloths and told me that my belly sticks out further than my boobs. He was worried also b/c I started shaking all over after we walked through the coffee isle. We've been trying for a year a 2 mths. My son needs someone to play with.",

            "answer": "If you gained weight then your hormones are out of wack. I would wait patiently and treat yourself like you are. It's not going to hurt to take vitamines and excersise. My doctor prescribed me vitamins when I told her I wanted to get pregnant. I work out three times a week and it helps with the stress during the week. I started gainig weight even though I work out, so that left me questioning if I might be or not too. I just know I have to wait is out b/c pee tests don'/t do me any good. If you don't start your period in two mths then I would get a blood test. That's what I've been doing. Atleast I know I'm healthy for the baby and that's all that matters. I have PCOS and type II diabetes and that puts my periods all out of wack. So, I can't count on a missed period telling me either. I've been walking a lot and every time I've ever walked 4-5 time a week I either start my period or ,like with my son, I was prego. Not saying that would work for you, but for some weird reason the more walking or running I do, the more chance I have a period that mth. I hope this helps.",

    "question": "I was late for my period last mth and then it started (I thought?) last wk of Sept with only 5 days of wiping blood. I pretty much didn't need a pad or anything. It was only showing when I went to the bathroom. Well,week after, my breasts got sore, got heartburn bad, felt bloaded, forgetful, tired, nausia ( but no throw up), and constipation. Well, this week, back started to hurt, my pants won't button up, my shirt won't button at the bottom, and I went down the coffee isle at the store and wanted to hurl. I took preg test after bleed and came out neg. so I will take one after I know I'm late again. What do you think? I was preg w/ my son and didn't know it until 5th mth b/c wouldn't show on pee test. So I don't trust the pee test.",
