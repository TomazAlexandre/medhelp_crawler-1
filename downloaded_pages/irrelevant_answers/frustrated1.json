            "answer": "Hi Nicole, welcome to our little MS community,Your experiencing, burning, tingling and numbness which is called paresthesia, and it's a common sx of peripheral nerve damage but it can also be caused by many other conditions eg alcoholism, diabetes, vit deficiency - anemia, B etc, thyroid disorders, viral etc etc.....Numbness or tingling in all peripherals (both hands and both feet), would 'not' be consistent with MS as the causation, basically because of how MS works.Has your actual eyeball started twitching or is it the eye lid, either upper or lower?Cheers.........JJ",

            "answer": "Hi Nicole -Eben though we all have our very own unique flavor of MS, most of us have had some combination or permutation of the symptoms you describe. JJ is rght in that most of the time MS does not present with bilateral symptoms. Because MS attacks individual nerve sites, its symptoms reflect the information that is normally transmitted through a specific site; i.e. left leg movement.There are exceptions, me for example :-) my first relapse wad characterized by bilateral foot numbness. That was 22 years ago and as the feeling returned I did nothing about it for the next 20 years. This is an example of unlilateral brain dumbness :-)The MRI is a good place to start your search, as is seeing a neurologist. Keep us posted.Kyle",

    "question": "I am 25 years old and have been having some weird symptoms. The past 2 months I have been having numbness and tingling in my hands and feet. Had one day of face tingling/numbness. My feet and legs have a burning sensation throughout the day. My feet sometimes feel tight, heavy and feel like they are going to give out. Some of my joints feel stiff. I have had muscle spasms. My left eye has been twitching off and on. I'm tired mentally and physically. I have had several labs done. Seen my PCP and a rheumatologists. They have ruled out lupus, arthritis, diabetes, and fibromyalgia. Scheduled for MRI Thursday. Also am being referred to neurologists. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this?",
