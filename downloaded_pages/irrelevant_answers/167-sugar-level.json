Caffeine dissipates around 1.5% per hour. If you drank 3-4 strong cups of coffee, with or without sugar, the leftover caffeine can skewer your test results. Try testing first thing in the morning [fasting] before you consumed any liquids or foods. This will provide you with a more accurate representation of your blood glucose levels. Be sure to calibrate the meter beforehand.2.] Are you planning on seeing your doctor soon? As previously mentioned test your T1 & T2 antibodies. With an AI disorder your thyroid and/or pancreas may have issues which may cause impaired/elevated blood glucose levels.",
