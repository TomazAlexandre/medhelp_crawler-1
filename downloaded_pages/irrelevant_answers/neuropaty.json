            "answer": "Hi.It is possible that most of your symptoms are related to diabetic neuropathy, although other conditions that could be present concomitantly cannot be ruled out at this point.Nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant but is commonly used off-label for treatment of neuropathic pain. Other drugs that can be used and might help relieve some of your pain include imipramine, narcotic analgesics such as morphine, anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or gabapentin, and antiarrhythmics.You mentioned being currently part of a clinical study for Bristol Myers. Are you under a nondisclosure agreement with them or can you tell us what drug you are being tested with for diabetes? Before you try alternatives for your pain, you might need to inform the study researchers about your current and planned alternative medications as they may interfere with the study results.Hope this helps. Good luck.",

            "answer": "I am not sure if I can tell the name of the drug yet, I have been with them for 2 years almost and just signed on for another two for the continued study to see how we cope with it on long term use. I will check with them to see if I can give the name. I do tell them what I will be using as a new drug come into need and they document the name and amount and then if it changes I have to let them know. I am hoping this drug helps to relieve pain and it seems to be taking the edge off but the feeling of being a little drunk leaves me afraid to drive my car. My stomach has a slightly nervous (butterfly) feeling in it and I feel different in the head slightly. Maybe that is just the feeling I need if it is acting like an antidepressant too. I don't think I was depressed before but the pain was getting to me since it is so constant.and I just don't know how much longer I can take it so finally I have agreed to take a drug. Because I don't drink alcohol or do any street drugs it might be just me who is worried and maybe I will not notice it later. It is funny that we pay a price to get rid of a problem. I will say this, my feet are hurting right now but less then they were before the pill. Last night was my first pill and tonight I just took my second, see what happens tomorrow. Anyway thanks for the quick reply especially on this special day. Merry Christmas to you and your family.",

I am also pasting\u00a0\u00a0the text of my previous posting narrating my problem.I had warm sensation on the soles of my feet in the summer and sensation of cold/hot in the spine near the shoulder blade in winter. the symptoms were very mild and few and far between.This continued for 30 years.Now those symptoms are gone but new symptoms-feeling tightmess in my soles of both feet since last 3years. I was a smoker for 50 + years.Probably this must have caused the problem. there is no medicine or even diagnosis of this problem. Suggestion to any therapy will be appriciated.",

    "question": "I am 44 yr old and have neuropathy in feet.due to diabetes. I am in a clinical study with Bristol Meyers for diabetes and so blood is for the most part under control. BP is 118 over 76, heart is rate is70s to 80s, Cholesteral LDL is 1.71, Triglicerides is high- 6.0 area. I am on Lipidil now at 145 mg and nortriptyline for pain at 25mg. Also Metformine 2000mg per day. First off, How am I doing? Anything else I can do?My pains include foot heat and cold sensitiveness, tingling, pain, balls of foot pain, ankle pain which drives me nuts at night, Also pain in left hip on certain movements, Left shoulder pain on certain movements, Knee pain and the feeling of swelling sometimes, Tennis elbow and arm pain and pain in my hands at certain movements like gripping. I also have diareeha most times. My blood checks and check ups say that my liver is ok, kidneys are not leaking, cardiogram is good and LDL has dropped from 3.70 to 1.71 in the past year. The problem is that I can't seem to lessen the pains and now have gone on to using the Nortriptyline which I have been trying to avoid for over two years now. I seem to have some relief but feeling of being on the edge of getting slightly drunk (happy). Should I become a user of this drug or is there something better? I agreed with pain specialist to try it out but I did not seem to get a whole lot of story on it and just want to hear from someone else on it and what else I could do.",
