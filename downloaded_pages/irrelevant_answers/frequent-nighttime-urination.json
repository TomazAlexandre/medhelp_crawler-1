            "answer": "frequent urination at night isn't a sign of herpes infection. You need to continue to follow up with your provider for this.\u00a0\u00a0It could be many things from too much caffeine/sugar consumption during your waking hours, nerves, infection or even something like diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Stop assuming that everything in your body means herpes and continue to look for other causes with your provider.grace",

    "question": "I already know I have Herpes 2, but am not back in the US so I can get on medication. I have frequent nighttime urination which is caused by the Herpes 2 ( i had done a bacteria urine test and it was negative) . I just wondered, when I get on Valtrex will it take care of the frequent urination at night or do I need to get other medication for that? Anyone out there ever experience it.I think a lot of persons come here for support, not just because they are worried they might be infected. I would love giving support. I have only been diagnosed about 3 weeks or less and I have to do the talk now several times to one past lover and to two persons I am meeting next week and it wall went very positively. Once you feel in yourself it is the right thing to do, I found that men appreciate the honesty. Oneof my\u00a0\u00a0ex's is a doctor. And he was not at all freaked out. he made me feel okay about it. He said...gosh this is so common. And yes, he would still like to date me.So it is scary when you first get the news and I have met many on the herpes dating site that just have given up on dating, but I want to say.....dont give up. You can find a nice loving partner just the same. And being honest and being able to be open, is such a great relief.",
