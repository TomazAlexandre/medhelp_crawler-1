            "answer": "We were giving Hildie 3 units twice a day beginning at the end of last July. After we saw the new vet a couple of months ago, with the blood sugar reading being at the low end of normal (95) at the time he estimates maximum performance from the dose, dose was reduced to 2 1/2 units twice a day.Hildie had lost weight, especially in her hindquarters, and muscle tone.\u00a0\u00a0She is rolly polly again (a good friend who is a vet says a dark secret is that kitties can withstand being a little overweight better than other animals) and has fully regained strength in her back legs.The first few months we were here, Hildie had to climb up to the back of the La-zee-boy in the sunroom.\u00a0\u00a0Now, she jumps from the arm of the couch, about 3 feet over and 2 feet up.My research has shown that with a good regimen of diet and other treatment, feline diabetes can go into remission.Miss Teia has gained back a little of the weight she lost under the stress of the move and eats about 3/4ths of her calories from wet food now.\u00a0\u00a0She ate no wet food when we first took her in a little over 4 years ago.Hildie eats about half and half wet to kibble.Chessie eats about 3 bites of kibble for every bite of canned.We'll be bringing all three girls in next month for their annual checkup.",

    "question": "...temporary headquarter.As I type, Missy Teia is sleeping on her favorite spot by the patio door,\u00a0\u00a0tuckered out from having had a little boxing match through the glass with Momma Cat from next door.Miss Hildie is asleep in the middle of the sunroom carpet, flat on her back, hind legs outstretched, right arm out and left paw over her chest.\u00a0\u00a0The lower dose of insulin seems to be just right.\u00a0\u00a0We're going to do a full day blood sugar curve for the vet and see if it can be furthered reduced.Miss Chessie just went back upstairs from one of her increasingly frequent visits downstairs.\u00a0\u00a0Last night she even made a tour of the sunroom.\u00a0\u00a0Both Teia and Hildie watched her with nary a peep.",
