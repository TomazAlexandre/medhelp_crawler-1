            "answer": "Welcome to Type 2 Diabetes.... not really a great club to belong to and losing weight is an issue anyhow, with diabetes it can be a miserable nightmare.I'm not a doctor or a dietician, so it might not be a bad idea to talk to them.\u00a0\u00a0What I can tell you is what worked for me in the past.\u00a0\u00a0Carbohydrates.... simple carbohydrates have to go.\u00a0\u00a0No excuse for them in your diet anyway because they will spike your blood glucose levels.\u00a0\u00a0(My doctor told me in a joking fashion, \"anything good, quit eating or drinking it\".)So, besides losing the simple carbs, boost the protein and change up your eating times and meal sizes.\u00a0\u00a0Instead of 3 regular meals, eat 5 small ones.\u00a0\u00a0Drink a ton of water to stay hydrated and to keep you more full for a longer amount of time.\u00a0\u00a0Change your workout routine every couple of weeks and if you are not lifting weights or doing \"weight bearing exercises\" start doing that now.I just thought of this too.... although you are not necessarily losing weight, you may be burning fat and replacing it with muscle.\u00a0\u00a0That is a good thing because muscle is a fraction of the size of fat.\u00a0\u00a0Again, all of the above apply here as well.\u00a0\u00a0Eat better, only the healthiest choices and smaller but more frequent meals.\u00a0\u00a0Drink a lot of water, lift weights and keep on the cardio.",

            "answer": "By the way, instead of weighing yourself as a measurement of success, try using a tape measure for a while rather than the scale.\u00a0\u00a0Look at your body and measure your trouble areas.\u00a0\u00a0Measure your waist, thighs, chest and upper arms about once a week.",

            "answer": "I'll tell you a couple of things that I do, but first I have to tell you this: don't buy anything that says \"sugar free\" those type of food have aspartame, which is a sugar substitute, bad for you. Anyways here's a couple of things that I do...first, smoothies...everyone's on the juicing kick right now, which is good, but juice doesn't have the fiber like smoothies.\u00a0\u00a0I put kale, collard greens, spinach, a carrot, small piece of ginger root, whatever fruit I have on hand, a scoop ground flax seed, 100% juice, and soy milk. Another thing I do is what I call bean salad.\u00a0\u00a0I get dried beans, any kind you like, I do a combo.\u00a0\u00a0Then you soak them in water over night then cook for two hours, smash and flavor.\u00a0\u00a0I dont buy canned beans because they add sodium and are cooked in lard...adds salt and fat.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, this way you have a lot of beans. So I get a bowl of greens, add a scoop of beans, tomatoes, salsa, avocado, whatever you would like...delicious and healthy, hope this helps!",

            "answer": "Totally agree with Brice, about losing the simple carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Avoid as much processed food as you can. Make sure you have lean protein with every meal/snack.\u00a0\u00a0A good snack might be an apple with peanut butter, or celery with peanut butter, a yogurt, cheese stick, etc.Center your meals around non starchy veggies, with your protein.\u00a0\u00a0Opt for fats, such as those found in olive oil, avocados, nuts, etc.Also agree that with your exercise, you might be building muscle, which is a good thing.\u00a0\u00a0Muscle is what burns fat.Another thing you might have checked out is your thyroid. If your thyroid hormone levels are too low, it will be very difficult to lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0I have the double whammy of being hypothyroid AND on the verge of type II diabetes (insulin resistance).",
