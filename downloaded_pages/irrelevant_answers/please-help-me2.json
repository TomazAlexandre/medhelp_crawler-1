    "question": "Ok, heres goes. I'm currently active duty in the Navy. I've been having these problems for about a year now, and doctors can't really diagnose me. Here are my symptoms:-Burning/Itching/Tingling of the hands and feet, along with swelling-Burning/Itching of red lesions (not sure if thats what they are or not, but they look like red bumps that are usually not in any particular shape, but are usually about 2-3 inches wide), i get these all over my body.-Extreme fatigue, it doesn't matter if I get 11,10,9,8\u00a0\u00a0hours of sleep I still feel very tired and weak.There are quite a few other things that are going on with me, but these symptoms are my main concern. I believe it could be diabetes. The specialist I seen about a month and a half ago asked me if there was any family history of diabetes, and I told her no. I was talking to my mother about all of this and I had mentioned my doctor asking about that, and she said that both my grandfather's brothers died from diabetes (on her side), one of my other grandfathers brothers died from it (on my dads side), and she had gestational diabetes when she was pregnant with me, and now her doctor is thinking she may have diabetes. She goes back to the doctor in a week for labs.Does it sound like I'm at risk? Could this be whats causing my complications? The specialist had originaly diagnosed me with burgers disease, but had called me about a month later and told me that it wasn't(after they took a biopsy from my hand). She couldn't really pinpoint the problem, just that I had some type of neuropathy. What do you guys think? I'd really",
