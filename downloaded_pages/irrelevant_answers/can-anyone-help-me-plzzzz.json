            "answer": "Hello,There are some reasons for recurrent thrush infection. These include when symptoms may not be due to thrush, when thrush is caused by other strains of Candida spp. such as Candida glabrata( These may not be so easily treated with the usual anti-thrush medicines), you are taking antibiotics, or if you have undiagnosed or poorly controlled diabetes.You should get a fungal culture of vaginal discharge done and all these causes ruled out.For recurrent candidiasis, we use topical or oral antifungals but for longer than usual. This may be for 7-14 days for topical treatments followed by fluconazole tablet once per week. This is called maintenance treatment, which often prevents thrush from recurring. Sometimes it is followed for 6 weeks.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
