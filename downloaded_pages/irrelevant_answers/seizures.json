Its a very scary experience for the person seeing it but its more terrifying for the person who its happening to so just stay calm and talk to him.. first u want to ask him his name, then ask him what month and year is it just to make sure he's fine and his brain function is ok ...but he does need to go get checked out by a physician.",

    "question": "I'm very concerned about my dad, he's been having episodes of uncontrollable shaking, muscle locking, pain and massiev temperature spikes; in moments like this he can't move or talk. My concerrn is parkinsons or epilepsy but these seizures have increased over time and when they started they were just shaking hands that when away after eating. He's been tested for diabetes, anxiety, parkinsons etc; and all of them have come up as negative. I'm really concerned about him and\u00a0\u00a0if anybody has experienced this and knows what it is or has any information about it please, please let me know. I know I don't have all the facts about what happens to him because i'm not the one experiencing it, but from what i've seen it's really taking a toll on him.thank you to anyone who reads this and can helpJade",
