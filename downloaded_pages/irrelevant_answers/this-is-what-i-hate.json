            "answer": "Hello,Increased hunger is called polyphagia and it can be due to many causes. In your case it can be due to psychological stress or hormone changes causing these symptoms.Please get your blood sugar (preferably GTT)done as polyphagia can be due to diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis and hypoglycemic attacks.Also get your stool examination done as polyphagia can also be due to intestinal worms.It can be due to graves disease or hyperthyroidism also.Please consult a neurologist or endocrinologist for the confirmatory diagnosis.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
