            "answer": "\"Last night I had borrowed an old gluecose tester from my dad\"Careful, an old meter and/or a meter out of calibration may show false positive results or totally inaccurate test results. Meters need to be calibrated every three months.Last years fasting levels don't count today. Go see your doctor and get tested, at least get the HgbA1c test. A fasting test only measures that moment at the time of the test not over period of days. The A1c goes back three months. The latter will determine whether you are a diabetic and/or a candidate.This site will show you a range of 'normal' glucose ranges and as you will see they drift all over the place from a low of 70 up to 160 depending on when you test.http://tinyurl.com/ywohjmHere is a link to the Mayo Clinic diabetes test page where it will explain the various tests.\u00a0\u00a0http://tinyurl.com/22lo2wBe sure to tell your doctor about your fatigue. Fatigue means lacking energy or strength and is a very common symptom. However, the term in common usage may mean many things, among them; drowsiness, listlessness, muscle weakness, malaise, sleepiness, and so on. You should include a treadmill heart stress test to rule out cardiology issues too.",

            "answer": "Kevin - Testing a meter and calibrating a meter are not the same. Testing is done by the patient while calibration is performed by the manufacturer. One tests the meter for accuracy. If it fails, one sends it back to the mfg for calibration but in most cases the mfg will just replace your failed unit with a new model.stryped - Here's a good read on HgbA1c home test kits http://www.mendosa.com/homeA1c.htm and\u00a0\u00a0List of NGSP Certified Laboratories (updated 1/08, listed by date ...",

    "question": "Just had some general questions. 1st, my dad is a diabetic. I am not as far as I know. He developed it in his 50's I believe. Everyone on his side of the family has it and heart disease and are overweight.I am 36, 6 feet tall 165 lbs. I am a runner. Last night I had borrowed an old gluecose tester from my dad. I ate a salad for lunch at 12:00 or so then nothing until dinner. At dinner I ate lasagna, salad, sweet tea. Anyway 30-45 minutes after dinner, my blood sugar was 118. Is this normal or does it seem kind of high? At the doctor last year fasting it was 91.Also, I have been suffereing from severe fatigue after my long runs and have to basically sit down for the rest of the day which I hate. I am going to start to check my blood sugar after these runs to see what it is. I eat alot after the long runs but it does not seem to help.What is the optimal blood sugar before starting a run, during a run,\u00a0\u00a0and after a long run?",
