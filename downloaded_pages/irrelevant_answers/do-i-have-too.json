            "answer": "Gestational diabetes can lead to macrosomia, or a \"fat\" baby. Babies with macrosomia face health problems of their own, including damage to their shoulders during birth. Because of the extra insulin made by the baby's pancreas, newborns may have very low blood glucose levels at birth and are also at higher risk for breathing problems. Babies with excess insulin become children who are at risk for obesity and adults who are at risk for type 2 diabetes - See more at: http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/gestational/what-is-gestational-diabetes.html#sthash.sKPG1Yqo.dpuf",

It may not affect the mother too terribly much but it can be extremely dangerous to the baby if not controlled.You say you work in the medical field - but you don't understand why it's important or how the testing is done or whether refusal is an option? Go ahead and get the test done. It's one quick drink and one quick blood draw and it can mean the difference between your baby being safe and healthy or your baby needing to stay in the nicu and possibly having lifelong medical complications.",
