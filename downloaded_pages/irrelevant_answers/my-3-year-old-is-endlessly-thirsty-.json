            "answer": "My daughter had very similar symptoms.She started out being very thirsty ALL the time. \u00a0Then she would be sick.She would seem to get better for a few months then relapse.After browsing the web for a long time after she became sick again, I noticed a trend regarding Type 1 Diabetes and increased thirst.I took her to her pediatrician and inquired as to he thought Type 1 could be a possibility and he dismissed my concerns and said she looked like she nay be getting a throat infection (she'd been vomiting!).One week later she started vomiting and could not stop. \u00a0I took her to the ER where they found her blood sugar to be 964 (normal is 80-120 and coma is possible over 600)! \u00a0Type 1 was confirmed immediately.PLEASE if your child is displaying these symptoms INSIST your doctor does a glucose test. \u00a0You can also buy a Relion glucose meter and test strips for $25 at Walmart. \u00a0 No prescription is necessary!You need only the meter, \u00a0strips, \u00a0alcohol wipes, and a little finger lancet to draw a small drop of blood. \u00a0Remember that 80-120 is a normal sugar (very slightly higher after a meal is normal), anything over 200... go to the doctor! \u00a0I wish every day I had known how easily I could have just checked her myself and helped her sooner.SymptomsBy Mayo Clinic StaffType 1 diabetes signs and symptoms can come on quickly and may include:Increased thirstFrequent urinationBedwetting in children who previously didn't wet the bed during the nightExtreme hungerUnintended weight lossIrritability and other mood changesFatigue and weaknessBlurred visionIn females, a vaginal yeast infectionhttp://mobile.walmart.com/ip/ReliOn-Prime-Blood-Glucose-Monitoring-System-Blue/20752266?type=searchhttp://mobile.walmart.com/ip/ReliOn-Prime-Blood-Glucose-Test-Strips-50ct/20752265?type=search",

    "question": "My 3 year old daughter is Endlessly thirsty. Over the last\u00a0\u00a0month Ive noticed her drinking is unquenchable. shes always been a \"drinker\" Where she seems to be thirsty all the time and she only really wants to drink (since shes been drinking from cups, for about 8 months) Recently she will ask me over and over for drinks and no matter how many i give her she wants another one. and when i finaly tell her no more, she will cry and cry! it wont stop, until she gets more to drink. She is not having a sweet tooth, asking for juice or anything like that, she wants water too! A couple times now I have caught her now in the bathroom climbed up on the sink and drinking tap water strait out from the faucet! It worries me, why is she still so thirsty that she has to suck water from a sink. She is still eating, she is just unquenchably thirsty. Does any one know if this is normal? Or what Could be going on with her? Thankyou!",
