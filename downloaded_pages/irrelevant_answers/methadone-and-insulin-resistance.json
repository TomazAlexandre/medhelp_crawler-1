            "answer": "I am a type I diabetic, and I believe it was brought about by doing meth and cocaine for about two years. I'm so glad you are trying to clean yourself up, but do see a doctor on being insulin resistant. I almost died because of this. Insulin resistance is nothing to take for granted. Please seek medical advice, and keep up the great work for trying to clean up. My hats off to you",

    "question": "Hi everyone, I was wondering if anyone could help me....I have been clean from all drugs since june, but prior to june I was on methadone for about 4 years (I feel disgusted saying that). Prior to that I was abusing oxycontin daily for 3 years. I am 24 years old. I am not overwieght, nor do I have diabetes in my immediate family, but I am concerned that I may have developed insulin resistance or that my hormones might have been very adversely affected by the drugs I was on for the past 7 years.Anyone know anything about this or can give me some advice?",
