    "question": "Hi I have borderline\u00a0\u00a0type II...I have been having a strange sensation in my feet, kind of like itching from the inside out, no amount of scratching helps, it comes and goes and happens just as I lay down in bed, it really drives me nuts and I wondered if it has anything to do with the diabetes or not? What could this be?",
