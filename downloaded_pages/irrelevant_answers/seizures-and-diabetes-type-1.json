            "answer": "Hello BevSells,I'm another volunteer and not a medical professional.\u00a0\u00a0Seizures can be caused by so many things, including low blood sugars.It would be good to talk to your grandchild's physician about the potential relationship (if any) between an infection in one's mouth/head (gum/oral & sinus infections are sometimes related, too) and seizures.\u00a0\u00a0Because everything you're reporting is happening in such close space & time, it seems reasonable that you're checking into any association.I hope that things stabilize for you all soon -- and that you'll let us know how things are progressing.",
