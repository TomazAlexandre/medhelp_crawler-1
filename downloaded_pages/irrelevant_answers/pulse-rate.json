            "answer": "The pulse rate, is, of course, the number of heartbeats per minute.There are two types of heartrate:(1) Compensatory(2) IdiopathicNormal heart rate is compensatory. Feedback mechanisms, primarily located in the left and right carotid arteries on the neck constantly measure the concentration of oxygen (02) and carbon dioxide (C02). The body produces exactly the right heartrate for the right situation.As air is inhaled and passes through the lungs there is a transfer of gases within the alveoli. Increasing the heart rate increases the surface area per unit time exposed to air.The body basicly establishes a heartrate that ensures the brain and tissues are always adequately oxygenated. When you escape and run from a predator (your ex-girlfriend?), the muscles need more oxygen so the heartrate increases.The heart rate is established by several pacemaker sites. The primary site is in what is called the atria. There are backup sites within the heart tissue in the event the atria malfunctions.Sometimes the atria sends inappropriate signals, which increases the heart rate without a true need for more oxygen. Sometimes the cause can never be established. This is called idiopathic tachycardia. Sometimes the sensors in the carotids degrade and malfunction, usually as a result of atheroschlerotic deposits or long-term smoking. The signals sent back become inappropriate.A higher heart rate increases pressure within the blood vessels and the increased diameter impinging on nerve tissue may result in neurological symptoms, specifically \"headache\".Glucose levels do not normally directly affect heartrate. Indirectly, under certain circumstances, unusual glucose levels may cause feedback mechanisms to increase blood pressure, but this is not cut-and-dried.",

            "answer": "I have reactive hypoglycemia and my pulse rate is very fast an 1 1/2 hours after I eat any kind of carbs. I would normally be in the low 70's and it would increase to the mid 90's without any exercise. I would also develop headaches when my blood sugar would drop. I would usually have them in the morning when I first wake up. If you have some kind of blood sugar imbalance you can develop headaches any time of the day. These are both very common symptoms to have if your blood sugar is high or low. How do you know your blood sugar is up? Do you use a glucose meter?",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Persistently high blood sugar can cause heart disease, kidney disease, resultant high blood pressure and because of heart disease a rapid pulse rate that you may become aware of (palpitations). High BP could be the cause of headaches.You need to get certain investigations done like fasting and post prandial sugar, glycosylated hemoglobin levels to know you over all blood sugar status. You may need further testing for kidney and heart function.I suggest you consult a diabetologist ASAP and not ignore this at all.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
