If you want to eat larger amounts, be consistent with how much you eat day to day, so that your medication can be monitored correctly via your blood tests.Try to stick with\u00a0\u00a0vegetables low in Vitamin K such as corn, carrots, cauliflower, eggplant, onions, green beans, peppers and tomato.Eat other foods low in Vitamin K, including meats, fruits, grains and dairy.Use oils that are low in Vitamin K such as corn oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil and sesame oil. Canola oil and soybean oil have the highest Vitamin K content.As for type 2 diabetes...are you on medication or insulin?\u00a0\u00a0Obviously, you need to limit your intake of sugars, highly processed foods, fruits, juices, etc.\u00a0\u00a0You may not need to keep them out of your diet completely, but limit them as your doctor advises.I feel you really should ask your doctor for a consult with a registered dietician.\u00a0\u00a0I think what you are asking for is too detailed and complicated to answer here.Best of luck.",
