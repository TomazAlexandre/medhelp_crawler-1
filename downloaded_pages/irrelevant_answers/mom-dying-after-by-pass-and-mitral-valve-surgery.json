            "answer": "Cindy,I'm terribly sorry for what you are going through with your mother.Q:\"Is this common with complicated cases?\"The combination of valvular surgery and bypass surgery carries a mortality risk measured at no less than 1 in 20 persons (5%).Q:\"My next question is what is the likelihood of things turning around at this point?\"When the lungs, kidney, and cardiovascular system all begin to fail, the mortality for the person suffering with the organ failures is quite high.\u00a0\u00a0You are in the awful position now of having to trust the doctors to guide you.\u00a0\u00a0Thankfully, most doctors are skilled and compassionate (I certainly hope that is what you have encountered), so let them give you some direction.The best piece of advice I can give, having seen this situation more times than I care to remember, is to communicate with your family (including your mother if she is able) and decide what you think your mother would want.\u00a0\u00a0There is usually no rush on end-of-life decisions, so try to not feel pressured.\u00a0\u00a0Take strength from where you can -- sometimes from one another, sometimes from prayer, sometimes from memories of better times with your mother.I'll keep you in my thoughts, and I'll check this board periodically thru the weekend to help as I'm able.",

We listened as a group to daily updates(in person or by phone) with the medical staff, consulted with other specialties,prayed for answers to our doubts and fears about decision making. Take it one day at a time, things may change daily or slowly and decisions may become more clear as to the path you will take. Update when and if you have time....as you can see and read here you are not alone.......and I can not say enough about the caring response from the MD, words and advice can change the course of one's life in difficult times.",

    "question": "My mom, who has diabetes, received two valve replacements, one mechanical, the other tissue (cow)valve; also, she had a double bypass in which they used one of the larger heart veesels.She was O.K. the first week but then on the Friday following the surgery they lost her blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0They put her on stong meds to raise her BP.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors were very concerned she wouldn't make it through the weekend.\u00a0\u00a0She also acquired Pneumonia at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0She progressed for a couple days and remained there until this morning (Friday).Now the meds to elevate her BP are doubled(at maximum), still her bp is only 90 over 48-53 range.\u00a0\u00a0She's also now on 90% oxygen, yesterday 30%.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors told me today she isn't going to make it.\u00a0\u00a0Her kidneys shut down since Tues. She's been receiving continuous dialysis. In addition, she is a complicated becase because of her diabetes.My question is: Is this common with complicated cases? The nurses said things could possibly turn around.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor asked if I wanted to start removing some of the life support to let her go naturally but I said to wait on that for a while.\u00a0\u00a0The nurses told me there is a chance her bp could start coming up again.My next question is what is the likelihood of things turning around at this point?Please help me, I don't know what to do.",
