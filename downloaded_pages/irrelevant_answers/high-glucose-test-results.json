Most of the time it can be controlled w/ diet even if you are diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I hope the next one is fine but if not it's not the end of the world.\u00a0\u00a0Thank goodness they have testing to monitor that stuff!\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.dottie",

            "answer": "non stress test is a test were the monitor how many times your baby moves in a half an hour... they do an u/s to measure the amniotic fluid and you get to see your baby twice a week haha.... when you take insulin the baby can get distressed and they just want to make sure everything is ok... also the induced me b/c the doc said there is a high rate of still borns in the last 3 weeks when you are on insulin... I sure all will be ok....I took my first 1 hr one at 12w to check early because of my history but it came back 118 which was fine I take my next at 28w I am sure I will have it as I have had it with two of my others... I am hoping I wont be insulin dependent this time because I am 100lbs lighter this time than last... but if I keep eating all of these sweets I just might be!!! :(",

The key is low carb (no sugar, sorry), and eating several small meals during the day. That is what I have been trying to do, and it seems to be working (so far).\u00a0\u00a0Don't worry, your little one will be just fine. :)",
