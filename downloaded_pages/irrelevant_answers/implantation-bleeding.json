            "answer": "This is how I figured I was pregnant! The implantation bleeding and SEVERE fatigue. I also got period like cramps. Like yourself I didnt get periods, havent had one for 4 years lol! I figured I wouldnt be able to fall pregnant due to many complication with kidneys etc so pleasantly surprised when I was! I took cheap tests when I suspected I was but all negative, figured I was testing too early. But my partner was so excited he ran straight out to buy a clear blue digital so I took it the next morning and sure enough there it was, 2-3 weeks. Currently 24 weeks now :) good luck and be patient x",
