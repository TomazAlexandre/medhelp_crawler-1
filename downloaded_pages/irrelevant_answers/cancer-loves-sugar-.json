            "answer": "I've never heard of the insulin-estrogen connection, but it kind of sounds plausible.\u00a0\u00a0I would check out that link to make sure there is some hard science to back it up, because cancer does like estrogen and a large load of blood glucose does cause a temporary insulin surge.\u00a0\u00a0I would guess unrefined sugar and most carbohydrate foods probably cause a bit less of a glucose load in the bloodstream and therefore less of an insulin surge than refined sugar products, and my guess is that there should be a lot of information out there in the diabetes literature.\u00a0\u00a0Let us know what you uncover, particularly about the connection between insulin and estrogen.",

    "question": "Last May I was diagnosed with breast cancer (stage 1-- tumor was 1 cm, E.R. positive, node negative, grade 3, Her2 negative; oncotype score was 29), had a lumpectomy, sentinel node biopsy, chemo, and now I'm getting radiation therapy. I have been researching lifestyle factors (in alternative as well as conventional literature) in breast cancer, including nutrition. I have received conflicting information in the literature. I have read that white refined sugar promotes tumor growth, while unrefined sugars, e.g. fructose, maple syrup, agave nectar, etc., do not, and are therefore safe to consume. Conversely, I also have read that unrefined sugars do promote tumor growth because they raise the body's insulin levels, which in turn promotes estrogen production. Is there any conclusive science that the medical community is aware of, on any of this?If some sugar (refined or otherwise) can be safely consumed, i.e. \"in moderation,\" what does moderation mean?How much is okay?",
