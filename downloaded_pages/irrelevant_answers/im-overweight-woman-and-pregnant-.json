            "answer": "I have been overweight with all 3 of my pregnancies, my current one is high risk but not because of my weight. Being overweight does not automatically put you at high risk, it is just a bit more likely to have more complications, like gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, etc. Eat healthy (ease off the carbs), walk a lot for exercise, drink lots of water! And try to stay in the weight range you are given. Good luck and congratulations on your pregnancy!",

            "answer": "It depends on how overweight you are. If it's only 30 pounds or so, you might actually be healthier than some. Your body likes to have extra fat for the baby. That's why it's do easy to gain weight while pregnant. If not, then just eat healthy and be moderately active. Like taking a walk every day. And you should be fine. :)",
