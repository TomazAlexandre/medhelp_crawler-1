            "answer": "My gyn put me on Yaz to get rid of my cysts on my ovaries and regulate my cycles.. I don't know anything about fertilaid.I would probably research other OBs because I don't think prenatals can regulate a cycle, and plus I think they should be much more responsive to questions. They should have at least said they would look into it.\u00a0\u00a0good luck!!! :)",

            "answer": "Doctors probably won't talk to you much about alternative therapies like herbal supplements and what not. I know mine didn't! I took Vitex (Chastberry) to help regulate my cycles. I also started acupuncture to help balance things out. I tried on my own to conceive for about 8 months before starting the Vitex. I really saw immediate changes when I started taking it. I started the acupuncture a few weeks after the vitex. 6 weeks into my acupuncture treatment my acupuncturist told me I needed to take a HPT because she was feeling that I was pregnant. Sure enough...I was :) So, if you are looking for something less invasive than drugs you might consider trying the Vitex and/or acupuncture. Some insurance will cover it and some won't. To me it was worth the money to try it. I'm so glad I did. I was kicking myself for not going sooner. I have continued to see the acupuncturist once a month during my pregnancy. I have had no morning sickness and in general...I feel really good.edI have heard of Fertilaid. I don't know of anyone personally that has used it though. Read up on Vitex and see what you think of that. It won't hurt anything to try it.",

I am saying if you want a normal cycle you start with Vitex and you will see the difference right away. I am taking them 3 x a day then after 8 weeks I took them two times a day now am down to once a day as for what the bottle says.and I get mine online at GNC and its only 7$ thats awesome.. no side effect or nothing.Am Ov on CD 11-12 and thats awesome my cycles are 23-24 now thats a amazing to me since I would go months with out AF at all.Try it and see it works.. and is even better for those with PCOS.
