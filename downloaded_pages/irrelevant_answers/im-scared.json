            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The feeling could be the side effects of the drugs you are taking. Suddenly stopping any SSRI drug can cause withdrawal syndrome characterized by nausea, electric shock like feeling, sweating, insomnia, confusion, vertigo, tremor and nightmares.It can also be due to fibromyalgia, can be due Vit D or Vit B12 deficiency or peripheral neuropathy of diabetes and hypothyroidism. A pinched nerve can also be the cause. Lyme\u2019s disease is another possibility.The best thing would be to consult a general practitioner or PCP and try and assess what is the cause of your problem. Then proper referral for concerned specialist can take things further and get you proper treatment. Take care!",
