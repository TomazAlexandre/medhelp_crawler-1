Just get your records and keep calling places somebody will take you. Just make sure know that you have been seeing a Dr and your switching.",

This is the only reason why I couldn't leave. And shes not even the doctor who manages my diabetes my high risk doctor does. They are the ones who helped me get it down. They agreed that a hospital visit was not necessary, i just needed my insulin.",

            "answer": "As a nurse I am surprised that they jumped right to trying to send you to the hospital knowing they had neglected to get you your insulin. You were perfectly reasonable to ask for the insulin first to see if that would work. I have had that happen with residents before and we never just send them out. We talk to the doc and give them a dose of insulin. Why would you needlessly subject someone to a long day at the ER without trying insulin first?\u00a0\u00a0I would say that you are better off but I would demand that they continue care until you are able to secure treatment with another provider. You'll be able to find someone I'm sure. Good luck mama.",

    "question": "A few weeks ago, my obgyn told me to go to the hospital to be triaged after having some difficulty with my blood sugar. It was completely due to them not filling my script for insulin. I explained that I could not make proper care arrangements for my family at the time, and could not go ( I literally had no one to help, which is rare). She begrudgingly filled my script, and after one dose of insulin my blood sigar went back to normal. The next day i received a certified letter for termination of obstetrical care. This is outrageous, and due to how late I am in my pregnancy no other OBGYN is willing to take me on.",
