            "answer": "hi.\u00a0\u00a0i spotted about 4-5 days before my period then it would come as normal when i was taking metformin; which was nice because i never knew when my period was coming so it was a warning for me like... better have some tampons in your purse. LoL\u00a0\u00a0he had me on it because apparently i do not ovulate and have PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0I took it for a couple months but the way it made me feel, i.e. sick with diarrhea was just not worth it to me.\u00a0\u00a0After I stopped taking it though I had normal periods for about 4 months.\u00a0\u00a0Now I am back to being all screwed up (it's been almost 80 days since my last period).\u00a0\u00a0Give it some time and perhaps it will straighten everything out.",

            "answer": "SillyRenee- what dose did they start you out at? They should start you out very slowly (like 50mg) and slowly increase it to reduce those symptoms. Believe me, you will get used to Metformin and it will help your PCOS and ovulation problems! For some people the side effects are definitely more intense.",
