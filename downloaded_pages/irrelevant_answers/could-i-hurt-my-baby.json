            "answer": "I work woth brittle diabetics. I dont believe there is much of a difference between type 1 2 or gestational but I can tell you how we manage out pts sugars.We test before they eat.. so that we know if they need coverage of insulin before their meal. We also test if they were high before eating.. a little while after eating to make sure all is well.Fat free is best because fat turns to sugar in the body just as carbs do. The sensitive thing with that is being prgo your baby needs fatty things like whole milk and such so idk what would be best. Maybe just reduced fat but not fat free.Also go for natural if possible.. peanut buttwr unless organic is loaded with sugar. Bananas and orange juice as well are high in sugars. We give them when a pts sugar is low.",

            "answer": "I have gestational diabetes and am limited to 175 carbs a day. I am also on insulin. I took that part hard. But you have to look at it as that if you are on insulin its not your fault but your hormones. They are just not letting your pancreas create the insulin needed to help break down carbs. I test my blood sugar 7 times a day and take three shots of insulin. It can get very tedious. I eat things like while grain bread and the pair it with an egg. For snacks I eat plain Greek yogurt and cottage cheese. Both have lots of protein in one serving. Then I would pair that with a cup if watermelon or strawberries. Also try to walk or do house chores for 10-15 mins after you eat your bigger meals and drink water with your meals. Both things help break down the carbs and bring down your sugar.I personally am so tired of gd. I can't wait till my baby comes out!",

            "answer": "I test first thing in the morning to see hat my levels are, then I eat breakfast and I test 2 hours after the start of any meal. I've bought everything according to what I can eat with the diet they've put me on. Like I said, the diet they have me on has me counting carbs. So for breakfast Im allowed about 15-30 carbs (1-2 carb choices) and I get the same amount for my 2 snacks between breakfast and lunch and between lunch and dinner. For my two larger meals I'm allowed about 45-60 carbs (3-4 carb choices). So as my dietician told me, portion control is key, making sure I measure out what I'm eating and reading labels as best as possible also no fast food or eating out until I deliver basically since there's no actual telling what's in their food.I'm not on any medications as of now but that's the next step if my levels don't stay where they're supposed to. In the morning they want it between 85-90 and after meals under 120 but its so hard as I was saying to actually eat a meal and keep them lower even if its sugar free, reduced fat, protein enriched, or super full of fiber.",

            "answer": "I just feel like ok yeah I have into cravings more this pregnancy so I feel like this is my fault not my hormones. The thing with the insulin shots, anyone in my family diagnosed with gd and put on medications never came off them after birth and now have it the rest of their life and since we are prone to diabetes I'm worried about having to be on medication for the rest of these 9 long weeks because of never coming off. I'm 23 and so worried ill have all the same problems as the other women in my family and I'm just so absolutely terrified of it all. But now with how little I'm eating (I'm sure yogurt can't be considered a meal all by itself) I'm worried I'm not giving baby what she needs so I'm at that crossroads between staying healthy and doin what they tell me to or feeding myself to make sure my baby is eating",

    "question": "I'm 31weeks 3 days pregnant and last week I found out I have gestational diabetes. I've been on a 'carb counting' diet ever since and have to check my sugar levels 4 times a day keeping it in a certain range. I've noticed over my week of this diet that anything that's actually a full meal, be it mostly protein and no carbs or under my carb limits spikes my levels. But if I eat snacks as a meal instead (light yogurt for lunch, laughing cow cheese triangle on slices of plain boiled chicken no seasoning for dinner kind of thing) then my levels stay where they told me it should. I'm so deathly afraid to eat anything now and I am starving! I'm worried though that obviously by not eating as much baby isn't getting the nutrients she needs thus I'm worried I'm doing more harm than good.Is there any advice you guys can give me? I want to eat and feel full without feeling like they're going to medicate me because my levels keep spiking. I also want my baby to be healthy but I don't want to starve her either and I really don't know what to do. I've tried a bunch of low carb/no carb dinners and complete portion control but they spike higher than my limits",
