            "answer": "HiWas the cause identified for your Bells lapsy? How much portion of the facial nerve was invloved? Have your symptoms disappeared completely or is the recovery process still not complete? Herpes simplex (HSV) and herpes zoster have been identified as the cause of Bells palsy in a large number of cases.Other causes include tumor, meningitis, stroke, diabetes mellitus, head trauma. Most of us have a dormant HSV in our body and it needs to be reactivated to cause Bells palsy. The reactivated virus can certainly cause damage to the facial nerve. Did your husband suffer from Herpes simplex or Herpes zoster? Herpes simplex is contagious but herpes zoster isn't.Best..",

            "answer": "See a sleep center. Recurrent \"Bells Palsy,\" memory problems, insomnia symptoms, chronic pain, and twitchy feelings in muscles are actually very characteristic of narcolepsy with cataplexy, and it can be exacerbated by the hormone shifts that happen with menstrual cycles. In fact, often times, people don't have \"Bells Palsy,\" but cataplexy. Viruses and some vaccines (namely the H1N1) can actually precipitate this, but it can happen seemingly in random fashion, too.Common misdiagnoses are depression, epilepsy, and migraines.It doesn't look the way you think it looks. I struggled for years to find an answer, and was misdiagnosed several times. I had it with just sleepiness during the day and what looked like insomnia at night for probably about 15-20 years before I ended up with more serious symptoms of narcolepsy that actually included cataplexy (random muscle weakness that can either be isolated, or widespread). Onset is typically in teenage or early adult years but it can come later, and earlier, too.The cataplexy manifested first in my face, as what looked like episodes of Bells Palsy that came and went when I was tired, stressed, or even when I was happy and smiling.\u00a0\u00a0But when I paid closer attention I realized I got weakness and twitching (not uncommon) in my other muscles sometimes too, though I chalked it up to clumsiness until I paid attention. I also had issues with my vision randomly and sleepiness.I went undiagnosed for about 15-20 years, until I finally saw a sleep specialist and she nailed the diagnosis right away. The vast majority of doctors have absolutely no idea what it is or what it looks like, and no routine lab tests, MRI, CT scan, x-ray or anything of that nature will detect it. 75% of people with narcolepsy never get diagnosed in their lifetime.I was tested for epilepsy, migraines, MS, all kinds of things. But nope, it turned out to be narcolepsy!!",

    "question": "I have Bell's Palsy.\u00a0\u00a0I do not remember when I first started noticing it but it had to have been 12-15 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have any tumors.\u00a0\u00a0I have regular MRI's and CAT Scans.\u00a0\u00a0I had a blood test this week because my husband had an outbreak of Herpes.\u00a0\u00a0I have never had any outbreak or other noted symptoms.My questions:\u00a0\u00a01) If the Bell's Palsy is due to Herpes which has always been dormant, can it later cause more damage to the nerve.",
