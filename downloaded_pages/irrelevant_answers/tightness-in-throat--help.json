            "answer": "Hi Wendy, I underwent a hemithyroidectomy 6 weeks ago, and suspect that what you're feeling is similar to my experience. In my case the pressure is especially around the Adam's apple/voice box area, while the tumour that was removed was a lot lower. I'm having a few other problems as well, and am seeing my GP tomorrow.Let me know how your throat develops!",

            "answer": "I'm glad to hear I am not crazy! I have found that massaging the area with vitamin E seems to relieve the pressure a bit. The pressure I'm feeling is actually lower than what your describing, just under my incision. Has your's improved at all with time? What are the other troubles you are having? Let me know how things go with your doctor. Thanks for the reply!",

            "answer": "Hey again, been away for a bit so didn't check the forum. Because I sometimes experience some breathing difficulty in addition to the tightness/pressure (especially later in the day) my GP sent me for some blood tests (including aneamia and diabetes), though not for the thyroid as my levels were OK 3 weeks after the surgery (TSH 1.5, T4 83) and she seems to think it's too early to investigate this further. Hmm.Will try the Vitamin E as well!",
