            "answer": "I'm on Lithium, and it's a very safe drug - extremely high doses have to be monitored careful, like many other drugs. I get my blood sugars checked for Seroqual, which I don't mind, it's a fantastic drug along with Lithium.\u00a0\u00a0I was on Lamactil alone but I became suicidal again, my pdoc put me on 300mgs of Lithium and it was only 2 days and wow what a difference. Since then, I've only had minimal depression. . Unfortunately most BP's have to take a drug cocktail, 2 or more meds.Seroqual at high doses can help with the psychotic features as well. They've also found and higher doses it can act as an AD, very interesting. I was told Zyprexa can be an \"activating drug\" to some, and cause anxiety. Paxil can really numb you out, I asked my pdoc yesterday, but I still feel flat, and she said that would not be a choice for BP, but if your son is really paranoid it might settle him down, an odd choice though.I would sit down with his pdoc if you have power of attorney, which I suggest when he's well to set up with you or a family member, so when he isn't well, his choices of treament are clear. The hospital which the clinic I go to is located, requires it. There are certain drugs I refuse to be on as well as it would be worse if I was put in isolation.You have so many things to deal with, I hope every thing smoothes out and he's feeling better.",

            "answer": "Well let me explain having tried all of these medications again the phrase from the site (everyone really should check it out) \"Depression Central\" \"any medication can cause any side effect\". That comes from a well known mood disorders specialist (not one I have seen).That of course depends. Antipsychotics will all cause tardive dyskinesia and put a person at risk for diabetes and Zyprexa is the prime offender for diabetes. But when Zyprexa worsened my paranoia years ago and it happenned to a friend of mine I knew what was going on. But that's not a \"common\" side effect. As for \"safe\" we should be factual. On the one hand, Lamictal can cause Stephen's Johnson's syndrome in one in a thousand people which is the rash that people worry about and I know someone who almost died of it but yet I'd say Lamictal is safe. Lithium can cause weight gain and has a potential for long term kidney damage so that's why people have blood tests to monitor for that. Some psychiatrists will not use Lithium over ten years for this reason and transition consumers off it and onto other medications but some psychiatrists such as my psychopharmocologist disagree. There are no exact guidelines except with dosaging and the monitoring of blood tests. Even with the Zofran I am I must get a liver function test once a year.Let's look at the two categories of medications. As per the antipsychotics the risk of diabetes is common and can be monitored for and the risk of tardive dyskinesia is to quote my psychopharmocologist \"5% per person per year for typical antipsychotics and 2.5% per person per year for atypical antipsychotics\". Clozaril is the only antipsychotic that is currently a medication that won't cause this long term side effect, which I have in advanced form. As for diabetes Zyprexa is the most likely to cause it but if a person isn't gaining weight on it then they are okay but if they are then its a good idea to ask their psychiatrist to change them to Abilify which is the least likely to cause it although it still happens. As for antipsychotics that will not cause tardive dyskinesia or diabetes and promote a full recovery, the glutamate antagonists, a new class of antipsychotic in development have not caused either of these side effects are promote a fuller recovery. I am on glycine, a glutamate antagonist in Phase II FDA and have made a full recovery from schizoaffective disorder. My psychopharmocologist will be publishing the results in a psychiatric journal. In the meantime for the official study google \"Dr. Javitt, glycine\".As for mood stabilizers there is much out there that is currently available that are approved medications available and used off label experimentally for bipolar. If someone's mood stabilizer is working and they can tolerate the side effects there is no reason to make an immediate change. But if they can't and have tried what's out there then they could consider seeing a mood disorders specialist. Not all medications are as effective on both ends except perhaps Lithium. Depakoate is better on depresion than mania and Lamictal in higher doses can sometimes even create mania. That's why I was taken off Lamictal and changed to another medication. That doesn't mean it will happen but it is a risk but Lamictal, in me at least and other people had less of the cognitive blunting side effects of Lithium and Depakote but each person's biochemistry is different. If you want to find out more about more mood stabilizers that a mood disorders specialist could and would be able to prescribe here's an up to date list:http://www.psycheducation.org/depression/meds/moodstabilizers.htm",

            "answer": "Just a FYI, Lamactil may cause mania at really really high doses. Moderate doses don't. I'm on 200 mgs, and doing just fine!All meds have some side effects, but if prescribed and introduced slowly, many including Lamactil won't have the serious side effects, so don't be scared off by the long lists of possible side effects.",

            "answer": "Lithium is the most effective MS for both mania and depression, your son is somewhat like my normal presentation actually though I do get hypomanic very easily.. Lithium works well for me and its a very safe drug PROVIDED you follow the rules, understand the side effects and get the right tests done.\u00a0\u00a0Its also very cheap.As for people who say Lithium isnt good long term there are many patients who have been on it for 20 or 30 years.The major reason lithium is not prescribed as much in the US is its generic and unprofitable and no one pushes it - preferring the newer AP drugs which are also much more expensive and have serious side effects (Lamactil isnt the worst by any stretch)\u00a0\u00a0Lithium requires an actual patient doctor relationship as it needs to be managed and a lot of pdocs dont want that, the sad fact is they want $$ in the door but not to have to manage a patients care.Cognitive blunting is also very rare on lithium, it is a non psychoactive but it can cause it in some people, pretty much all MS and AP drugs have cognitive effects as do all Anti Depressants regardless of the lies the doctors will tell you.\u00a0\u00a0Anything that messes with brain chemistry can blunt you.",

My weird side effect is craving dairy, I'm not sure which drug is doing it, but at least it's not a bad thing, I was calcium deficient before :)My Dad is diabetic, and is always drinking, he watches his blood sugars very carefully, and he gets tested consistently for his BP and Cholesterols. The tremors can come from all sorts of reason, and your spouse should get checked out that it isn't something else. As well there are other meds that can augment the Lithium and bring that's meds dosage down if it's the culprit. Does she take Lithium more for the depression or for the mania? Depakote, I'm told is not the drug of choice for BP2's, check with her pdoc if she has one. I'm on a combination of Lithium/Lamactil/Seroqual, the first two for depression, the last for the manic/anxiety episodes.\u00a0\u00a0 I've had some serious sweet cravings, but I've been like that off the meds as well.
