    "question": "I am glad its not just me. I guess this started yesterday. I was thinking it felt like laying on my massage mat but now that you say cell phone it does feel more like that. At first I didnt think it had a rythym but thought last night it felt more like a heartbeat, steady but slower. Its in my left leg near my ankle but the rest of my leg has more of a rolling spasam feel sometimes with a slight cramping feel. I did have a bad (spontainious) staff infection in the bone of that leg 11 years ago with a septic ankle and almost lost the leg. I had 5 surgeries to flush the infection from the bone. I had been worried this might have returned. I do have a few health issues like diabetes (insulin dependant) and take a beta blocker as well as thyroid meds. I did read on webmd that thyroid issues can cause lack of blood flow. As long as I am not running a fever I am confident its not a reoccuring staff infection but I would like to know what this is since it showed up out of nowhere.",
