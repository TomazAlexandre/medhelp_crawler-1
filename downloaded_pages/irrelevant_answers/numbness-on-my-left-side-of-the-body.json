            "answer": "HiThanks for writing.I am sorry to say, but what you are suffering from cannot be ignored. What you had was initially a TIA or transient ischemic attack, where there is a partial or temporary loss of blood to the brain.\u201cTIAs are often warning signs that a person is at risk for a more serious and debilitating stroke. About one-third of those who have a TIA will have an acute stroke some time in the future. Many strokes can be prevented by heeding the warning signs of TIAs and treating underlying risk factors. The most important treatable factors linked to TIAs and stroke are high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, heart disease, carotid artery disease, diabetes, and heavy use of alcohol. Medical help is available to reduce and eliminate these factors. Lifestyle changes such as eating a balanced diet, maintaining healthy weight, exercising, and enrolling in smoking and alcohol cessation programs can also reduce these factors.\u201dRefer: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/tia/tia.htmhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_ischemic_attackPlease consult your doctor and a neurologist at the earliest. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else.",
