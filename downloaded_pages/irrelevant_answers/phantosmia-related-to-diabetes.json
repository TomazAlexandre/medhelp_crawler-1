            "answer": "Chefangie, I have been dealing with this phantosmia myself for about a year. this is my 3rd round with it in a yr. The odor for me is really strong cigarette smoke, burning inside my nose. It keeps me awake through the night because the smell is that strong and actually makes my nose sting inside as if someone was really blowing cigarette smoke inside my nose. It is very frustrating to deal with and it makes you feel like you must be going off ones rocker. I two have type 2 diabetes. Thank you, brebka5",
