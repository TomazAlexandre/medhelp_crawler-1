            "answer": "Your glucose level can definitely be tied to thyroid problems.\u00a0\u00a0All of my sisters and I developed Type II diabetes or pre-diabetes after our thyroid surgeries.My symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0I had none.\u00a0\u00a0I had a full-body CT scan run and they found a small nodule in my thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0I went to my doctor and he gave in and ordered an ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0It showed a small, complex nodule and I decided I didn't feel good about it so I had it out.\u00a0\u00a0They found cancer while I was in recovery (hence 1/2 out one year, the other 1/2 the next year).\u00a0\u00a0My labs were completely normal before the surgery.Since both of my surgeries all four of my sisters have had TTs (3 cancerous, 1 precancerous) and my daughter had a TT (precancerous).My levels stayed pretty level until I had to have RAI last November for recurrence - since then I've gone from very hypo (75.9) to very hyper (0.06).Since all that my hypo symptoms were crushing depression, cold all the time, no energy, and terrible body aches.\u00a0\u00a0My hyper symptoms have included insomnia, heat intolerance, restlessness, heart palpitations, and body aches.They might want to check your antibodies too.\u00a0\u00a0All of my family (but me) have Hashi's and that caused their thyroids to enlarge.Thyroid problems - just a laugh a minute!!!I really hope you can get some answers!",

            "answer": "Thanks so much.I was on the internet last night and cannot find the chat room again.\u00a0\u00a0There were a lot of comments on the discussions about some people with a level over 5 could barely function.Do you know if my elevated glucose of 113 can be related also.I recently had foot surgery and I am off work.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like when I can go back, I would not even remember how to do it.My levels were a result of a blood test I had, but the level (TSH) has gone up quickly.\u00a0\u00a0I can't remember the date of my last blood test for thyroid levels, but I don't think it was that long ago.Thanks again.What were your symptoms?",

            "answer": "Don't know about your levels or the ranges for your lab but you sure have the symptoms of hypo.\u00a0\u00a0What type of scan did your doctor want - nuclear scan or ultrasound?It wouldn't hurt to get an ultrasound and schedule with your endo.\u00a0\u00a0There is a chance that you have another nodule or that the remaining part of your thyroid is growing.I know I feel *horrible* with a TSH of anything above about 2.Your TSH does sound high so it wouldn't hurt to start the higher dose while waiting for an appointment with an endo.\u00a0\u00a0Your internist could also order an ultrasound so you could have the results for your endo.Hang tough.",

            "answer": "Hey,Just wanted to pipe in on your TSH level.\u00a0\u00a0It does suggest that you are hypothyroid.\u00a0\u00a0I was on a small dose of synthroid for years and started having symptoms a couple of years ago - hypo symptoms - but my tests always came back \"within ranges\" - which I know now was too high.\u00a0\u00a0At 5.0 I felt horrible.\u00a0\u00a0Turns out - after ultrasound, that I had thyroid nodules - found out after FNA that I had papillary thyroid cancer with follicular variant.\u00a0\u00a0I had TT in August and 175 millicures of RAI-131.\u00a0\u00a0While waiting for RAI, I had to go through HYPO HELL, and my TSH level reached 58.9!!!!\u00a0\u00a0I could barely walk from one side of the room to the other without feeling I needed to sit and rest.\u00a0\u00a0It was horrible.\u00a0\u00a0Just went back to the doc again for recheck on my neck - did tsh - and called me yesterday and said that we were going to lower my dose of 125 to 112.\u00a0\u00a0Turns out my tsh level was 0.19 - with ranges being 0.34 - 5.50.\u00a0\u00a0The only sign of hyperthryoid I've had is irritability and increased hunger.\u00a0\u00a0Other than that, I wouldn't have thought so.Anyway, I hope that things level out for you and that you start feeling better.\u00a0\u00a0It is miserable when your tsh is too high.Peace,Charley",
