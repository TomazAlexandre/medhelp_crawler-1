            "answer": "Migraine headaches can cause many different symptoms, and the symptoms you are describing could be related. However, this is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that other conditions need to be excluded first. Without looking at the scans I cannot comment on the mild prominence. The radiologist feels that the normal fluid spaces in your brain are increased slightly compared to other people your age. The fact that it has not changed in 1 year means that it most likely does not reflect any abnormality. Remember that everyone is different, and \"normal\" is defined by the mejority of people (but not all people).Blood tests for thyroid dysfunction, inflammation, B12 levels, and diabetes should be checked to ensure that they are normal. The normal EMG helps to exclude injuries to the large nerves. Otherwise perhaps a second opinion would be reasonable. They can re-evaluate your history and tests and then make further recommendations. Good luck.",

    "question": "I am 39/male. Migraines began Jan.2003 after 14 months of high abdominal pain that took 3 doctors and 5 tests to determine was gallbladder disease. Headaches started 2 months before cause of the pain was found. I was stressed not knowing if I would die before my wife gave birth to our baby.\u00a0\u00a0After surgery the abdominal pain stopped, but the headaches did not. EEG test was normal. MRI radiologist wrote, \"Mild prominence of the ventricular system which is greater than expected for the patient's age.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise normal MRI, non contrast.\"\u00a0\u00a0That made me nervous, neurologist said not to worry. Medication is neurotin, 1200mg/day.Now a year later my migraines are worse, I feel light headed sometimes, sinus pressure, hot pin feeling in ears. What worries me most is that my arms feel \"heat\" sometimes and legs started tingling for 2 days then stopped for a week then again for 2 days and my knees hurt for a day.\u00a0\u00a0A month later legs started having tingling or pain most days. EMG normal. 2nd MRI one year after 1st still showed nothing but the prominence.\u00a0\u00a0I never had hair on lower shins above ankles. Now have dark spots on skin above ankle joints.\u00a0\u00a0Neurologist suspected CMT, now does not nor ALS/MS.1.Are these \"normal\" migraine symptoms?2.What does the \"prominence\" greater than expected mean?3.Why the tingling and dark spots after a year?\u00a0\u00a0My neuro had no idea.Thank you for your time. I know this was long, I appreciate it.",
