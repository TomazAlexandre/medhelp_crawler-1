            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I am sorry to hear about your daughter. Since all possible causes of vomiting have been ruled out, there is a possibility that this is cyclical vomiting syndrome. This is characterized by bouts of unexplained vomiting that stop as they came with a symptom free period and start again. There is no test to diagnose it yet. Diagnosis is made by a careful history which shows that each vomiting episode was similar to the previous one in terms of pattern, duration and symptoms.While this may not have triggers but often triggers are found like emotional stress, exams, fights in schools, inability to adjust to one\u2019s environment etc.Treatment is supportive with medications to stop vomiting, IV fluids, a calm peaceful environment, counseling of the whole family etc.It is difficult to diagnose on net but I can give you some good leads that should be followed in a person who is vomiting again and again. Commonest cause of chronic nausea and vomiting is acidity. Give her omeprazole (empty stomach in morning) and antacid gel and see if it helps. Liver and kidney dysfunction is another cause. Hence kidney and liver function tests should be done. Other causes are diabetes and hypothyroidism. Electrolyte imbalance too can cause nausea. IBS, gluten or lactose intolerance, parasites in gut too can be the cause. A stool test should be done for worms, giardiasis etc. Also if nothing is found then food challenge test to detect food intolerance should be done.Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "Our daughter has been admitted to the hospital several times for severe vommiting and nausea. She has had every test done except colonooscopy. There is no symptoms of problems with the colon. Doctors said it was vommiting syndrome. Now they say they are not so sure but don't know what it is. Today they discharged my daugter after she was re-hydrated and she felt better so I took her for a bit to eat and she immediatly threw it up. Same day the doctor re-admitted her back to hospital but says he does not know what to do. i'm a little upset the doctor did not give her food before her discharged her as well.",
