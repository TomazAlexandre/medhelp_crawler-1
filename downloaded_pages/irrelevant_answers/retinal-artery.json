    "question": "Hello. My GP referred me to an optometrist for eye testing because I was complaining of vertigo, daily headache, tinnitus and scotoma (sp). My spectacle prescription was still valid but a retinal scan showed pallor and arterial vascular disease consistent with hypertension. I am a 58 yo female with hypo NOT hypertension. My Cholesterol is below normal and I don't have diabetes. I do have a history of bone marrow cancer treated with chemo and a genetic defect in copper metabolism. I have in hospital intravenous copper replacement every 6 weeks with steroid cover of 100mgs hydrocortisone pre and post infusion. I also have Neuro degeneration due to the copper error and am wheelchair bound with cerebellar ataxia and upper motor neurone problems. My Neuro condition is progressive and deteriorating.Is it possible that the constant depletion/replenishment of copper could cause retinal vascular disease? If not, do you have any other suggestions as to the cause. Does it require treatment?",
