    "question": "Hi - 50 year-old male, got a chest x-ray because of possible pnemonia or other complications (had Flu-like symptoms for a while, difficulty breathing, smoking for \"forever\"). On antibiotics, feeling much better.The report comes back saying lungs are clear, but I have a \"tortuous Aorta\" which I suppose means twisted. Can't find a thing on the internet about this. Is this dangerous, what causes this, and what to do about it? I have perfect stats....BP 115/70, no diabetes, no other heart disease that I know of (had every heart test imaginable throughout the years and always perfect). The only issue I ever had was palpitations which were diagnosed as a minor electrical issue, and anxiety issues. I am NOT on any meds whatsoever.",
