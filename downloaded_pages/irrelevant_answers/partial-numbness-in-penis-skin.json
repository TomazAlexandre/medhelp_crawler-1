            "answer": "Hi pintoo,How are you feeling now?Any type of tingling, burning, severe pain, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. The nerve involved appears to be originating from lower back region.Yes, it is your Diabetes and Vitamin B12 deficiency causing numbness all over.This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.In your case I feel it is nutritional deficiency pathology which is causing symptoms.I think you should consult a physician to evaluate your case.Once your vitamin levels are regularized there won\u2019t be any concern further.Hope this helps.Bye.",
