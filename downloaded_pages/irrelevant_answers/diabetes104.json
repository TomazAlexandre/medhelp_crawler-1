            "answer": "Almost all foods can be broken down into sugar (fruits, some vegetable, especially carbs), so with that being said, its almost impossible to get foods with out sugar in them.\u00a0\u00a0Your syptoms seem to point to a high blood sugar, at least for me and for most sick feeling and dizziness are common when you BS levels are elevated.\u00a0\u00a0I cant say anything about the heart palpitations and kidney infections because these could be because of diabetes or some other unrelated issues.\u00a0\u00a0The only real suggestion that I can give you, is to limit the amount of food you eat at one time, especially if it is complex carbs (pastas) because it takes the body longer the break them down, thus creating a higher level of sugar in the blood.\u00a0\u00a0If you reduce the amount in one sitting and try to eat smaller portions more often in the day it may help with you syptoms, but please speak with your health care provider about all of your syptoms to ensure that there is not something else going on with your body.\u00a0\u00a0And good luck.",
