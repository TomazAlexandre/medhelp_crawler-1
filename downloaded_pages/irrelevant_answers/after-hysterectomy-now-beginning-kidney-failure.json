            "answer": "Hi welcome to our forum.I had to resurch your post. It is a new question for me which doesnt happen too often..I been cl here for 2 years.Endo can effect any tissue, muscle, organ in pelvic area. I had endo too my ovary was engulfed in it and attached to bowel.Endometriosis I have noticed long ago a great correlation of women developing thyroid problems...likely because endo and thyroid are both autoimmune.What I discovered today, and I read several articles and doubled checked the facts is there is a 36% chance of increased kidney problems, when a woman has endometriosis. These\u00a0\u00a0can range from endo tissue being attached to malignancy. The range of possible problems is great, so please dont think Im trying to tell you its cancer.I do think you should get to a top notch urologist right away..better safe than to worry. I have to wonder why your family dr or whomever noticed the high creatin did not order more testing. Unless your levels are just borderline.I also know that kidneys can go bad from a few other things like dormant strep infections.I really wish you well,,,,,I think just my opinion remember Im a volunteer not a Dr...if I was you Id bypass the gyn and get to a urologist/urosurgeon as you probably will be instructed to get a biopsy.Have you had any tests ultra sounds? it could be polycystic (many cysts) just so many things.So yes it could be related to the endo...or it could be some completley different reason.please let me know how your doing when you find out any information.do you have blood in urine? pain. fever. difficulty either holding or voiding?Cherie",

    "question": "I had a complete hysterectomy in 11/07 due to severe endometreosis. My doctor said that I was one of the worst cases he had ever seen. I am now 45 yrs. old with no history of kidney disease, high blood pressure or diabetes in my family, but have had high creatnine levels for some time. I was trying to find out if there is anyway that the endometreosis could have effected my kidneys and I would just now, 21/2 years later be experiencing problems?",
