            "answer": "I'm 38 weeks 5 days as well. I have an appointment on the 3rd and if she hasn't come by then they're setting my induction date. I'm not dilated at all and not thinned. I've tried walking, sex, bouncing. And nothing. Guess she's just staying put. Ugh. I feel your pain. I hope I don't have to have a csection.",

    "question": "I am almost 39 weeks, ftm. I'm so frustrated! My cervix is halfway ripened, I haven't dilated, cervix still closed. My baby boy is estimated to be 9.5 lbs at 40 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I have gestational diabetes, so my Dr says it won't be safe to deliver naturally with gs if baby is more than 9 lbs because of broader shoulders. Although he had a nurse make an appointment for me at the hospital to be induced on my due date.\u00a0\u00a0If my body doesn't react to the meds he will perform a c-section.\u00a0\u00a0I really want to have my baby naturally! Who has tried using evening primrose oil, walking, and using a breast pump to help with the labor process? What worked for you?",
