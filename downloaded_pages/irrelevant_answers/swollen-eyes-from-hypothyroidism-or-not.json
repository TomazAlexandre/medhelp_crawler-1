I've been on thyroid medication for the last 17-18 years and my thyroid has only been functioning properly for the last 3 years. I've always retained water, even before I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. I just wish there was something I could do to get them to go back to normal. I've done the tea bags and cucumbers on my eyes, I've put cold sppons on my eyes, I've taken water pills, I elevate my head when I sleep and I just don't know what else I can do. My doctor seems to think it's from allergies, but I don't agree, and she is NOT a thyroid doctor. We don't have a thyroid doctor where I live, so it *****.",

    "question": "I've had hypothyroidism for the last 17 years, and about 2 years ago, the skin between my eyebrows and eyelids became swollen. My doctor says it's from allergies, but I only have seasonal allergies. I think it may be peri orbital edema. I've researched things about my thyroid for many years. I want to know if there is anything I can do to get rid of the puffiness. I also have type 2 diabetes. Any help is appreciated!",
