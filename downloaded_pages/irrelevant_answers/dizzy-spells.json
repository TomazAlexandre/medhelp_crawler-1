My doctor has put me off work now, I was hoping to make it to the middle of june as well but i guess that is not happening. She never gave me any tests because baby is moving fine and growing fine, she just told me to take it easy and rest as much as possible!!",

            "answer": "I have had this problem also, but I'm anemic. I'm constantly tired and I get dizzy to the point where I can't focus. I was hoping to work up until 38 wks but everyday seems like it gets harder and harder. Try talking to your doctor about your concerns because you're going to need all of your energy and strength when it's time to bring baby into the world. Good Luck!!!",

    "question": "I have been haing dizzy spells the past couple of weeks but yesterday was the worst i thought i was gonna pass out and barly made it to sit down i became hot and look like could not get it together so i went straight to labor & delivery they monitored the baby alittle over and hour and she was fine i was sent to the er where they ran test on me and all my bloodwork was fine but my pressure was alittle low so the dr's say the baby is making my pressure drop and or stopping blood from flowing to my entire body and that i would probably keep having these spells until i have her which ***** , but im glad its not gestational diabetes like i thought. I still work but only on the weekend until 6/12 but now i wonder will i make it that long, with my older kids i worked up until the day i had them but knew i would not be able with this one but now i feel like i wont make it to the 12th. Has anyone ever experienced this?",
