    "question": "I have an appt today with my ob/gyn at 15 wk 4 days and also will be doing the glucose test.\u00a0\u00a0Blech.\u00a0\u00a0They want me to do it early because I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes my last pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I hope everything is going ok because I still haven't gained anything and my clothes still all fit. I really don't want to flunk the glucose test, especially this early into the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0That would mean pricking my finger 4 times a day again (and maybe worse) at least last time I didn't have to do it for quite as long.\u00a0\u00a0Well, wish me luck!",
