            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to small blood vessels, chafing or friction rub or dermatitis skin. If it does not hurt, itch or discharge then there is nothing to worry about. Frequency of urination does not have anything to with this mark. Frequent urination can occur due to a number of conditions. One of the commonest is excessive consumption of fluids/liquids. It is also common during the winters when one tends to sweat less and thus our body tries to compensate by making more urine.It can also be due to diabetes mellitus. Other possibilities are diabetes insipidus, glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis(inflammation of the kidneys),urinary tract infection, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia(low potassium),hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism and diuretic drugs.I suggest you to discuss these possibilities with your urologist. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi. I have a tiny, pencil eraser type mark on the head of my penis, just above the rim. It is skin textured still with no cuts in the skin etc. There is no pain or itching to mention. Also just below the head on the other side I have a red mark, but to me it just looks like blood vessels because when I stretch the skin out all I can see is loads of tiny red blood vessels grouped together.I have also been feeling like I need to pee all the time, but I'm not sure if this is because of my overactive imagination thinking about my penis all the time.I have been fearing herpes as I have read it can present as a mild rash, does this sound like it at all?",
