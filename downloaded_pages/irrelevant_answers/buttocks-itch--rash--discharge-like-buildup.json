            "answer": "Hello,From the symptoms it sounds like intertrigo. An intertrigo is an inflammation (rash) of the body folds. It most commonly occurs due to bacterial, viral or fungal infection. An intertrigo usually appears red and raw-looking, and may also itch, ooze, and be sore.Please keep the area clean and apply some topical antiseptics. Also wear loose-fitting cotton clothing and use an antibacterial soap or mild soap like dove. Topical zinc oxide cream like Sudocrem, Desitin are very helpful(apply with a paper towel and not directly with hands).Application of mild steroid cream like dermacort also helps. For the itching please take some over the counter antihistaminic like Benadryl or Claritin.In case the symptoms persist then antifungals may be needed. Please consult a dermatologist in that case.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have had this problem for a few months (3-4) now...Starting from my anus up to the top of my buttocks is a red rash that is VERY itchy and has a yeast-like film across the entire affected area. Often the itching has got so bad that when I scratch it, there is blood.I have changed my diet, tried anti-fungal and yeast creams, rash ointments, etc., and ensured I keep the area clean.I do not have diabetes and live a very healthy life. I am in good shape, eat healthy and exercise regularly.I am a 24 yr old male.I am abroad and cannot visit a doctor at the moment and I've reached my limit of what I can take. It is becoming a source of anxiety.",
