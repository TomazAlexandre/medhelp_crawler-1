            "answer": "I'm not sure if you're talking about 20 years ago or the levels you refer to are from recent testing. A level of 75 mg/dl 2-3 hours after and OGTT [Oral Glucose Tolerance Test] falls within normal range, not requiring a glucose tablet.\"I can't figure out why I would be put on medicine. Can anyone help explain to me what the reasoning would be.\"If still overweight Metformin has been known to be Rx'd to help with weight loss. The person to ask why you were Rx'd Metformin is the Endo. He/she is the only person who knows the reasoning. But then you say, \"since then I have not taken the meds.\" Since when, 20 years ago? Please clarify.Too clarify blood sugar levels; First, your morning fasting levels are normal which have ranges of 60/70 to 99 mg/dl. Second, If \"After a regular meal and even drinking sweet tea my sugar never goes over 145.\" is 2-3 hours post meal then your levels are above normal. Sweet tea implies sugar. Try substituting with Stevia or Splenda. Neither raise blood sugars. Watch your carb and starchy food intake too.Go here to educate yourself on diabetes - easy to read, easy to follow.

            "answer": "Another suggestion: We can cure and prevent the diabetes easily by following the 2 below simple steps. Many diabetic patients followed these steps and found great improvement in sugar level.1. We need to chew the food very well. When you chew it, teeth grind the food well and it will become semi liquid shape with saliva. We need to taste the food while chewing so more saliva will form that will surround the ground food. After the food has become semi liquid shape only, we need to swallow the food.2. We shouldn't open the mouth while chewing until we swallow the food",

    "question": "Years ago the drs told me I had type II diabetes. I'm talking 20 years ago. Lost a lot of weight and never heard anymore about it. I went to a new endocrinologist and had the sugar test done. My h1c test was perfect. I had to go back and do the sugar test. When I started the test fasting my sugar was 117. After drinking the sugar drink the first 30 minute blood test my sugar went to 195, then they took it again at the next 30 minutes and again at the 2 hr mark. My sugar at this time was 75 and they had to give me a sugar tablet to get my level up before I could leave. when I went back to talk to the dr he put me on metformine. since then I have not taken the meds. When I get up in the morning my sugar is between 77 and 90. After a regular meal and even drinking sweet tea my sugar never goes over 145. I don't understand diabetes at all I guess. I can't figure out why I would be put on medicine. Can anyone help explain to me what the reasoning would be.Thanks and God bless",
