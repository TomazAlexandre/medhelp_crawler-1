            "answer": "Hello,I feel so sorry to see you in pain.I would like to add few questions like: Is the tingling/ spams radiating in nature..I mean does it start from the shoulder tip or any another particular point and run to your fingers tips? Secondly do you have such spasms throughout the day as well as night, even when you are resting and not using your hand?I would like to know whether you have concurrent illness like diabetes, high blood pressure etc?From all that you have said its really difficult to tell you what you are suffering from. To be on safer side, I think you should better get in touch with a physician who would examine you neurologically and then opine.I would be happy if you keep in loop.Regards.",
