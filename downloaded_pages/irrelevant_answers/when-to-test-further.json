    "question": "Hi,My question is about when to become concerned about blood sugar readings. The last check-up I had last year showed fasting blood sugar was still normal with a score of 90.\u00a0\u00a099 was the upper limit of normal on the reference range. This was 10 points higher than it was two years ago.Is it too soon to request glucose tolerance testing?My mother is a type 2 diabetic, two of her sisters were as well and died of diabetic complications. One had an amputation as did a brother of my father who was diabetic.I also have Hashimoto's thyroid disease.I am physically active, exercise daily and am of slender weight but so is my mother and were my aunts.Also, when I urinate it smells like a donut shop, It's the only way I can think to describe it, sorry.I eat a lot of fruits, veggies and whole grain foods.So I guess my question is if I just sit and wait to see what happens as the fasting glucose rises, or are there tests that will indicate a problem earlier?",
