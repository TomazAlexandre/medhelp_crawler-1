    "question": "My 3 year old drinks all time, guzzles his drinks all at once then immediatly askes for more. He also urinates frequently, and it smells and is usually a bright/dark yellow. Diabetes runs in out family but the doctor keeps telling me not to worry, because he is a very healthy weight and size. He is a large boy, tall and sturdy. Not overweight, just sturdy. Now he is sleepping all the time. For 12 to 14 hours a night, then 4 hours or more for his afternoon nap. He tells me he is tired and lays himself down. He also has been having Charlie horses in his legs, so bad that he wont walk on it for whole days at time. Again the dr. says its just a charlie horse and give him more potassium, Bannanas are his favorite, he eats one a day at least. The newest complaint is his stomach. He tells me it hurts all the time and dosent want to eat. Hes not strarving, he will eat a little usually just once a day now. Should I be worried?",
