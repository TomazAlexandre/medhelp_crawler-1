            "answer": "Has your ophthalmologist taken a really good look at your retina? My mom had an unusual form of histoplamosis which showed up as little black dots in the capillaries in her retina. This wasn't discovered (even though she had seen an ophthalmologist for years for myopia) until the capillaries blew, causing the same effect as diabetic retinopathy (minus the diabetes). As a result of not getting proper eye care, she's pretty much lost the sight in that eye. Perhaps you can find an ophthalmologist in your area who specializes in retina care.",
