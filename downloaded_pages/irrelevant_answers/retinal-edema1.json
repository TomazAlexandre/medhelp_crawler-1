            "answer": "Why has no one responded to you?I'm just a patient who has had retinal (macular) edema for quite a while. Mine is a postoperative complication. This is a common cause.. especially after cataract surgery when it is called Irvine Gass syndrome. It can occur after other eye surgeries. It can also be caused by neovascular disease or retinal vein occlusion. Diabetes is a common cause, but I really don't think high blood pressure by itself can cause it, but again, I'm a patient not an ophthalmologist. Have you heard or read that high blood pressure can be a cause??? What is your situation? I might be able to offer advice, I've had multiple bouts of cystoid macular edema over 2 1/2 years.",
