            "answer": "Nerve conduction studies test the integrity of your nerves and how fast or slow the message is carried from the starting point to the end.\u00a0\u00a0If it's testing strength, then the direction is from the spinal cord to the body part, and if it's sensory then the direction is the opposite.\u00a0\u00a0If the message is slow, it could mean a number of things, but does not really relate to the BFS or the symptoms you're experiencing.\u00a0\u00a0It just means that for some reason, the message isn't carried at a normal speed because of things like diabetes, trauma,vitamin deficiencies, hereditary problems, electrolye abnormalities, and in the case of carpal tunnel syndrome - pregnancy can be the cause of slowed responses. I would not be too concerned about it especially if you are not having any symptoms of pain, numbness and weakness - just the twitches.\u00a0\u00a0If you are really worried, then consider a repeat nerve conduction test down the line, Hope that helps.",

    "question": "Thank you for answering my question.\u00a0\u00a0I have been having muscle twitches now for almost a year.\u00a0\u00a0They began during my pregnancy last January during a bad bout with the flu and move all over.\u00a0\u00a0They are mostly in my feet, calves but also sometimes in my hands.\u00a0\u00a0I currently have a \"hot spot\" in my right foot that has lasted two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I can see the twitch and when it spasms hard I can see all of my toes move.\u00a0\u00a0It does not hurt but it sure is annoying.\u00a0\u00a0In August my Neuro gave me a mostly left sided EMG.\u00a0\u00a0The needle portion was normal but on both legs I had one area in both of my calves (the same nerve in each calf) that tested \"slightly slower than normal\" on the Nerve Conduction Study.\u00a0\u00a0She did not seem concerned.\u00a0\u00a0She ruled out MS (2 normal Cranial and cervical MRIs over the last 2 years with & without contrast) and ALS.\u00a0\u00a0She said my normal neuro exams over the past 1 1/2 years and the needle portion being normal did not mean ALS.\u00a0\u00a0She said it was BFS and to wait it out.\u00a0\u00a0What does a slow nerve on a NCS mean and why would it be on both legs.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be causing my feet to twitch or is it just anxiety/BFS?\u00a0\u00a0Also - my Neuro worked up extensive bloodwork (lupus, Vitamin B....) and all was normal.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your help!",
