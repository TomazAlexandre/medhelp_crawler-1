            "answer": "Update: went to see another specialist for a second opinion. Bad news.He says the left eye which had the surgery was still definitely detached and would never get better in the state that it is in. The silicone oil bubble seemed to be only partially filled, which could be part of the reason. The right eye will be lasered down on the 22nd so hopefully that will be one less hurdle we need to jump.I want this new specialist to perform another surgery on the left eye if there's a slim hope that the eye is still saveable. Even 10% chance is better than 0% in my opinion.My wife is freaking out at the thought of the laser accidentally destroying her last remaining eye. I can only reassure her that we won't let her go blind, but I'm starting to get a little apprehensive myself.What is the success rate for laser surgery on a detached retina?",

    "question": "My wife had sudden blurred vision back in January. She had prolific retinal detachment due to complications with diabetes. She described it as a blurry mass in both eyes and a line down the center of her left eye, giving her splitscreen vision. Due to insurance complications we weren't able to get surgery until April. The surgeon chose to do one eye at a time, so we decided to do the left eye first. The doctor said the surgery went well, reattached perfectly with minimal scar tissue removed, and he used a silicone bubble to hold the retina in place. It's been six months now and during our last check up he said the retina is healing well and the oil bubble is holding in place. However there might still be a little fluid behind the retina that needs to drain on its own before she can see again. Right now, her vision is completely black in that left eye, and her right still remains detached. I fear that if we delay any more action she could lose her vision completely.Should I get a second opinion on this or is this normal for this type of surgery?",
