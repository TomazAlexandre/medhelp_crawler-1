            "answer": "There is debate whether the terms 'borderline diabetic' or pre-diabetic' are even meaningful. A lot of doctors will tell you, you either are or you aren't. A more meaningful measure of your insulin resisistance is the HOMA test which takes your glucose and insulin into account. There has even been some research showing that the diabetes drug Metformin can help certain sub-groups of HCV patients show better results when treating with IFN. This definitely deserves more research on your part before making any decision on whether to treat and how to approach your treatment. The archives of this site are a good place to start.Good luck.",

    "question": "Iv'e had a liver biopsy twice in the last 10 years, Both time's it came back stage 1, I opted NOT to do the current treatments since my liver is mildly scarred, Iv'e had this for over 30 years and it seems to be moving slowly, Im waiting for better treatments with less toxitity and better SVR, (Im geno type 1), I just found out im also border line Diabetic, The question is, Even though my biopsy results are mild fibrosis, I continue to feel Extremely tired and nauseated!, This is a daily chronic event, I find it difficult to work or just function in general?, The doctor said the diabetes was probably weight related so I even dropped 50lbs!, I still feel as bad as I did when I was Heavy?, Do you think this fatigue and nausea is due more to the Hepatitis C or the diabetes or both?, I keep thinking that if I opted to do the treatments, I feel so BAD now that if I did the treatments, I would probably drop dead!, Your thoughts???",
