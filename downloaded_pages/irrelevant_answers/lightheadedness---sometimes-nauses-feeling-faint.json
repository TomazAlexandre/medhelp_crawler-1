            "answer": "It could be a few things... Have you had any blood tests to check for Anemia? It could also be Diabetes, but there are usually other symptoms involved as well.\u00a0\u00a0If you are a female, it could be pregnancy...\u00a0\u00a0But I think your best bet is Anemia.\u00a0\u00a0You should go to the doctor to get a blood test, and if you don't have insurance, you can get a blood test done at the hospital for like, $75, if you're really worried about it.\u00a0\u00a0If you would like to see if you can get the symptoms down at home, just try eating a more healthy, balanced diet.. If you are vegetarian, you need to up your intake of iron and protein, either take a stronger supplement, or give in and have a steak.\u00a0\u00a0Cow liver is also abundant in iron.\u00a0\u00a0There's my two cents for ya.",
