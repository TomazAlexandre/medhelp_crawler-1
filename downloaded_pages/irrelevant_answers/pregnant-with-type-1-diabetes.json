            "answer": "Hi,I am diabetic and 32 weeks now.Your baby moves more when your sugars are high becuase the high sugar gives him / her extra energy - like when a child takes too much sugar, it gets hyperactive.Please do your very best with your blood sugar and treat your diabetes very agressively.\u00a0\u00a0This is done with insulin (you need to adjust both basal and bolus as the pregnancy progresses), exercise, and eating a lower carbohydrate diet.\u00a0\u00a0Try to avoid foods that you know send you high.\u00a0\u00a0Work closely with your doctors.It is great that your baby is doing well.\u00a0\u00a0What is important is that he doesn't get too much energy particularly in the last months, as this will cause him to produce extra insulin and will make him fat (and may make the delivery more difficult).I am currently being asked to try very hard to limit my weight gain as they are scared my baby is too big.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the input you really helped me a lot. I have gained 15/16 lbs in 21 weeks which is right on track with what my doc says.I have an insulin pump as well as a CGM attached to me trying to monitor the patterns of high/low blood sugars. I teach Spin and exercise regularly. Its weird that when I am teaching a Spin class I can't feel the baby kick but when my blood sugar goes high I can feel her kick me a lot. Oh, having a girl by the way :-)",

            "answer": "I have had 2 children with diabetes. My first i had gestational which later became type 1 somehow... Dr still not sure why... I know its hard soemtimes to keep levels in line. I reccomend more frequent bs checks to help with keeping under control. Also are u on a pump or injections? I ask because with my first i was on injections and 2nd with a pump and it was so much easier to manage with my pump.",
