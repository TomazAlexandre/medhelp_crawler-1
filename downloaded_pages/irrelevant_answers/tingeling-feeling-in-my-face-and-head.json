            "answer": "sounds like to me a nerve problem. i am no expert but had a ruptured disc in my neck. Nerve pain is so crazy. I thought i had messed something up in my shoulder but actually it was a disc pressing on a nerve. it is hard to diagnose unless there is something major going on with a disc. You will have to see a neurologist probably to get a diagnosis if this is the problem.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Tingling in head and neck is seen in peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes. It is also seen in peripheral vascular disease.Compression of cervical spinal nerves too can cause it. It can also be due to cold and sinusitis. In all probability it is cervical nerve compression. Without examining you it is difficult to access the situation. Please do not ignore it. Get a neurological consultation ASAP\u2014maybe from ER, to rule out any hemorrhage in brain (however minor it may be).Other causes are cerebrovascular accident, head injury, facial nerve injury and compartment syndrome.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
