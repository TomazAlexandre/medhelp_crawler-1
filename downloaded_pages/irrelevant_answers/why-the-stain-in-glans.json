            "answer": "I was diagnosed with Epididymitis and hidrocele one month ago. They said that this developed because I had frequent urinary tract infections (2 in a row, to be exactly) but because I was taking fluconazol, in strong dosis, I discontinued the antibiotics for the Epididymitis and the hidrocele (ciprofloxacin). My testicles are not that swollen anymore but I had pain when I ejaculated. I wonder if this may be related to the pain in the body of the penis and the feeling of a swollen glans...Thank you,",

    "question": "I am 21, circumcised and have not had sexual relations. Two years ago, I noticed a stain in the tip of my penis, that covered almost all of the urethral opening. At the same time, big bumps developed in the rim of my penis, 3 to be exactly, but did not pay attention to them. Two months ago, after I hit my penis with a book, I went to see a doctor. He told me the stain was because of my circumcision was damaged and did not consider it too important. Regarding the bumps he gave me an ointment (Bethametasone, Clotrimazole and Genthamicin) and they reduced its size slightly. Around one month ago I developed candidiasis and got tested for diabetes, and other immunodeficiency disorders that came out negative. The doctor suspected it was because of my high level of stress and the fact that I hardly ate during a week.\u00a0\u00a0He gave me fluconazol to treat it and the bumps in the rim of my penis started to get smaller. However, one of the bums turned red in one part, as though it was about to bleed and so did the other. Now, regarding the pain, I have a swollen vein in the place where the book hit, for almost two months. The doctor says it would take a week to heal. I was also not able to get erections until two weeks ago and pain started at that time. throught the body of the penis, what is more I ejaculated once and felt the glans swollen, is it normal? To summarize, I have the following problems:a)there is a stain in the glans of my penis. This has been present for at least 2 years and a half, as far as I can remember. When I was a kid I injured in my penis, but do not remember if I had the stain.b)there are three big bumps in the rim of my penis, they decrease in size with fluconazol, but as I still take it once a week by the end of the week, they are increasing in size again. Two of them have some parts that are turning red, as though they were wanting to bleed.c)I hit my penis, I could not get an erection for one month and two weeks but now that I do, I feel the glans swollen and the body of the penis hurts.d)I have been tested for immunodeficiency virus, diabetes and have not had sex. I have had candidiasis in the past month.I hope you can help me with this, I am getting concerned and I am afraid this may be cancer :(",
