            "answer": "Nothing he is doing is wrong, from what you wrote.Diabetes, in and of itself, is a tiring chronic condition.\u00a0\u00a0Although it's redundant cycle of maintenance (the finger sticks, blood testing, insulin injections, carbo counting) become routine over time, it can and does wear on your mind.Since this is still early (he hasn't made the 1 year mark yet) - there are a lot of things going on and until the dust settles down, he may not be ready to get totally back in the saddle again.\u00a0\u00a0With Diabetes, your body is thrown out of whack. When you start managing Diabetes properly, it takes your body time to get back to something close to normal.\u00a0\u00a0And that includes Sex Drive (hormones).\u00a0\u00a0It's not like \"take some insulin, get back to normal\" ... How much time does it take?\u00a0\u00a0Varies from person to person.Also - beware of depression and burn out.\u00a0\u00a0Kills sex drive fast.\u00a0\u00a0Depresion doesn't necessarily mean crying fits or balling up a corner of a room.\u00a0\u00a0It can also manifest itself in sudden or gradual lack of interest in things.\u00a0\u00a0At first, many Diabetics get real positive about management. Close monitoring, careful eating, doing things by the book to get that \"100\" on the BG meter when they test.\u00a0\u00a0That lasts about 4 months.\u00a0\u00a0Then reality starts to really sink in - the realization that you have to do this \"forever\" and although everyone talks about finding a cure, it still doesn't exist and may not exist in your lifetime.",

            "answer": "I would also recommend finding a doctor he can talk to.\u00a0\u00a0Or talking to some medical professional.\u00a0\u00a0I have had Type 1 Diabetes for 27 years, but, I am a woman.\u00a0\u00a0I have read articles over the years about this problem for men, but, I don't understand it.\u00a0\u00a0In the back of most of my Diabetes Forecast magazines there are tools for Diabetic men who have had some type of sexual problem due to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Again, being a woman, I don't know what they are for, I just know they are always there and I have seen articles about it.The point is, if he discusses it with his doctor, there will be no shock to the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0And, it may be simple to work through with the right information.\u00a0\u00a0The key is finding a doctor he can ask.Good luck with this.\u00a0\u00a0I think it's great that you are supporting him by looking for answers.",

    "question": "My fiancee was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes about 6 months ago. It seemed as if he lost his sex drive... he says it's not that he doesn't want it. He doesn't have a problem getting an erection either. Thats the only problem in our relationship, everything else, emotional is all perfect. We are completely in love. He is taking insulin and his blood sugars are being controlled, however he still hasn't gottan much of a sex drive back. What is it he is doing wrong? We do not feel comfortable seeind his doctor, as he is a family friend, so any advice is appreciated. Thanks.",
