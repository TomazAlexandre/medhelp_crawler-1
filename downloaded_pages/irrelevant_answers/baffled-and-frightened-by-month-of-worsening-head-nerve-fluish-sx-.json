            "answer": "Hello,This feeling of tingling that you are having are called Paresthesia. Chronic paresthesia indicates a problem with the functioning of neurons.Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes(which you already have), hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.Also keep a regular account of your blood sugar levels esp HbA1c.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your input! I didn't know what to call this tingling; now I do!Re your suggestions, what is really baffling is that all of these areas have been checked into, and so far all is \"Normal.\" Vit. B is OK. HbAic is within normal limits (and always has been.) Thyroid panel--no abnormality.Since posting two days ago i've developed tingling in my lower back, primarily on both sides of my spine (not in the center.)The symptoms just keep relocating, and waxing and waning. I still get lightheaded but less often; today there is less tingling in my face but some still there, earache is less though still some pressure on the left side.I feel like my nervous system is under attack by something, but what??.",

    "question": "My symptoms (episodic but frequent lightheadedness, sinus and ear pressure) began suddenly 4 weeks ago and have continued to evolve and move around my head since then. My doctor said i have nothing wrong showing up in my labs at all so this must be classic sinus/inner ear problems, but the way I have been feeling (generalized and unpredictably odd symptoms \"firing off\"in my head and neck and sometimes in my arms--feels more like aflu or inflammation of some sort, despite\u00a0\u00a0NO white cell increase or other signs of bacterial or viral infection. (As a type 1 diabetic of 21 years (a 56 year old femalem) I usually can detect an infection because it raises my blood glucose readings. That isn't happening either). Most of my sx are on the left side of my face/body though recently ear pain has developed to some degree on the right as well.My symptoms haven't abated at all and new ones are constantly evolving for the past\u00a0\u00a04 weeks and this\u00a0\u00a0concerns me a lot. Especially since I developed a feeling of \"fever\" in my body just yesterday (cold chills in my trunk, back, arms and an odd feeling of something in my left armpit in the middle of the night) which comes and goes ---i really feel some infection must have invaded my head and now my body. But no one finds anything abnormal in my tests!Today, after the chills in the morning, I went out in 63 degree sun and had a sudden sense of heat and flushing in my head and face. I never felt this before! Came home and took my temperature---94.5. Just like yesterday.By the way, I've checked my blood pressure as well as glucose readings during these events---basically normal, though my BP has risen slightly to around 136/82 more or less, and then recedes back to the usual 120/80 or even lower which is my norm.THe really confounding symptom is left sided nerve tingling in my face which happened once and went away about a week ago and recurred in limited form just yesterday. (tingling left half of my tongue, lips, cheek, neck--dissipated in about 15-20 minutes. Yesterday the same but limited to lips and part of my cheek.) No weakness or numbness.I can tell my MD is beginning to think me a hypochondriac though I've never been a complainer in the 15 years I've been her patient before.......Seems my symptoms don't fit any category. I worry much more because of my diabetes making me vulnerable and because the symptoms are clearly significant but undiagnosable and so far, untreated.",
