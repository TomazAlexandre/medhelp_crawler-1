            "answer": "The 3 hour is not fun, you get double the sugar, on your empty stomach. They wouldn't even let me drink some water to get rid of the taste. You get poked 4 times...But it's very well possible you'll be OK. They take 4 values and you can have 1 high. My first time 1h was 139 and I failed the 3h, second time 1h was 159 and I passed the 3h... (and I was sleeping inbetween the blood drawings since I was in the hospital), so it's hard to say if walking inbetween will help... Anyway, you're 30w already so in 4-6w your sugar will lower again because your placenta gets older so if you have it it will only be for a couple of weeks. Good luck to you!",

            "answer": "I was 3 points off when I did my 1 hr. The Dr.'s cut off is 140 and i was at 143. My Dr. wouldn't have been concerned and would have just let me go, but my first son was over 9 lbs and sometimes that can be a cause of GD in subsequent pregnancy. Well, my numbers were completely nornmal for the 3 hour test. I am just bound to have big babies. My Dr. said this one is going to be about the same size as the first. Just bring a good book or if you like needle work that would also be something to pass the time. I did mine in the Dr. office and I wasn't allowed to leave, due to common side effects such as dizziness and getting really tired.",
