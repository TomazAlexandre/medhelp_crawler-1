    "question": "Hello! I'm 39w3d and I went to the drs this morning and my Doctor decided to admit me tomorrow night and get me started on cervidil and be induced Friday morning. Anyone else gone thru this with cervidil first? What should I expect? Chain of events? I'm so nervous I'm nauseous! I'm excited to meet my little girl but I wanted to go naturally. But bc of her size and having gestational diabetes he doesn't wanna wait any longer.",
