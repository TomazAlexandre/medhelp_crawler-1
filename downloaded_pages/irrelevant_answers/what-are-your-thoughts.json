            "answer": "While your iron level is good, your ferritin is quite low in the range.\u00a0\u00a0Ferritin is a storage hormone for iron.\u00a0\u00a0Your level indicates that you don't have much iron in reserve.Elevated methylmalonate indicates vitamin B12 deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0You should ask for a standard B12 test, if you haven't already had one.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, do you have results for MCV and RDW on your lab report?\u00a0\u00a0Those are also indicators of vitamin B-12 deficiency.Cholesterol levels look good, though triglycerides are high. High triglycerides can be caused by obesity/overweight, uncontrolled diabetes, hypothyroidism, eating more calories than you use, or excessive alcohol consumption.\u00a0\u00a0High triglycerides are a marker for metabolic syndrome.Your Vitamin D is still pathetically low........lol\u00a0\u00a0 Looks like you may need another mega dose.\u00a0\u00a0Or simply increase your daily dosage and retest to be sure levels are increasing.\u00a0\u00a0Talk to your doctor about this, as low vitamin D can cause many hypo-like symptoms.You're right that the A1c test is run for diabetics, but it's also used in conjunction with other tests to diagnose diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Even though your fasting glucose on that particular test was 92, your A1c indicates that there are times that your blood sugar levels are much higher than normal. You should ask for a Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT).\u00a0\u00a0GTT is a series of glucose tests done at 1 hr intervals, over a period of 3-4 hours, after drinking a very sweet, syrupy liquid.\u00a0\u00a0You should, also, talk to your doctor about getting a blood testing meter and keep track of your levels for a while, just to see what's going on.\u00a0\u00a0Glucose testing meters are quite inexpensive.\u00a0\u00a0While you may not have full fledged diabetes, you could very possibly have insulin resistance, which, typically, leads to type II diabetes. Insulin resistance is also a marker for metabolic syndrome.TSH is a poor indicator of actual thyroid levels. I read another of your posts showing that FT4 was at the top of the range and FT3 on the floor.I agree with the consensus that you should be adding a source of T3.In my opinion, you have more than one thing going on.",

            "answer": "Sorry computer went wack.......the misplaced sentence, \"And yes, I too believe that after colonoscopy, I will increase my iron in taking additional Ferrous Sulfate, and maybe some blackstrap molasses to try and raise the ferritin.\u00a0\u00a0As for raising the D; I currently take 2,000 units daily; how high can I go without toxicity daily?\u00a0\u00a0When I was first tested my level was 16 with 30 being the bottom; after 50,000 units, one tablet weekly for 12 weeks, I. Only came up to 29.\u00a0\u00a0Last tested I was 31 and year later 34.\u00a0\u00a0Very slow process.\u00a0\u00a0I also eat two Brazil Nuts daily for selenium boost.Last but not least, a doctor who will work with T3 supplement to lift symptoms I am experiencing for hyperthyroid as well.Thank you so much for answering my post.\u00a0\u00a0Your advice and comments are truly appreciated and always taken to heart.\u2764",
