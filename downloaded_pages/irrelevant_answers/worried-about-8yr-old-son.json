            "answer": "Hi TonyaR,You're right, I'm no doc, but I do know that an A1c of 5.4 is normal, so I wouldn't worry. You say he's always been a thirsty kid, so that's normal for him-- if his thirst suddenly spiked, that would be different. But of course keep an eye on it, hopefully without pricking him too much for no reason. If he starts losing weight, that's an issue. Having to wake up at night to pee a couple of times because you're drinking so much (and peeing out so much) is also a sign.The signs of type-1 diabetes are extreme thirst and urination, rapid weight loss and blood sugars of typically much higher, like 400, 500, 700. My daughter lost 20 pounds in a month and had sugars of 450 at diagnosis, and we seem to have caught it fairly early, because she wasn't sick and didn't have to be hospitalized.Good luck with him. If you want to make extra sure, you should see an endocrinologist instead of an internist.",

I am going to tell you our story in hopes that something may help you.\u00a0\u00a0I have a 7yr old with ADHD he is under weight. He also is a very thirsty child and he urinates a lot. I took him to the doctor back in August of 2006.\u00a0\u00a0She gave us a glucose monitoring system, and had me check him for one week 3 times a day. She said she was looking for before meal readings of over 130-140mg/dL and 2 hours after meal readings that were over 180mg/dL. When we went back he seemed to be ok. So the doctor wanted to check his weight blood glucose once a week.June of this year I noticed that he lost weight so I checked his weight and he lost 6lbs. I took his blood glucose reading and he was 193 mg/dL fasting.\u00a0\u00a0When I took him back to the doctor he had large keytone",

    "question": "Hello everyone, i am new here and doing research for my little boy. I need some advice, I know you folks are not Dr.'s, but you all have exp.Joshua was 8 this month and has always been a really thirsty kid, which made me suspicious. Tested him @ home just on a whim, and it was 174. So I got a few more readings & contacted the Dr. They did the workup and his A1C was like 5.4, which I know is just within \"normal\". That was all the Dr needed to hear and dismissed it as normal. My gut feeling said to keep an eye on him. A few days ago, I used my last test strip 4 a random reading just as he finished the last bite of lunch and it was 206. Had my Mama, the RN, to recheck on hers and it was 215. I should mention these are higher than the previous ones. This is combined with he seems really sensitive lately, eats every 1 1/2 hours, and ofcourse the drinks a lot.Can any of you make suggestions to me?",
