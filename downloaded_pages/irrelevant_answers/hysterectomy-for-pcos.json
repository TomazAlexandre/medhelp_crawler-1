            "answer": "Greetings SFX,Hysterectomy is not standard treatment for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a disorder that stems from the ovaries. Removing your uterus will not cure PCOS. First line treatment for PCOS often includes combined hormone therapy a.k.a \"birth control pills\" , weight loss, evaluation for endocrine disorders such as diabetes and in the event of hirsutism (male hair pattern) spironolactone. Removal of the ovaries in the reproductive age women is associated. with it own morbidities and is therefore not commonly performed. How ever it is well documented that wedge resection of the ovaries and/or laser drilling of the ovaries is beneficial. The hemorrhagic cyst may be unrelated to your PCOS. Thank you ,Erich T. Wyckoff, MD, FACOG",
