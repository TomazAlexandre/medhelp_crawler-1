    "question": "I am praying that someone will be able to help me.I am a 33 year old female that was diagnosed with Type diabetes at age 15. I have been on insulin from then and for the last 4 or 5 years I have been on a pump.\u00a0\u00a0My HBA1C Levels have been good so I have no issues with my diabetes as far as I am concerned.I was diagnosed with Poly CysticOvarian Syndrome...I have never had normal periods and I have always had to deal with acne.\u00a0\u00a0In order to conceive my first two kids I did like 5 cycles of Clomid with each.\u00a0\u00a0 All pregnancy's were normal.About 5 years ago, I just started with shortness of breath.\u00a0\u00a0It felt as though an elephant was sitting on my chest and I couldn't get the deep breath in.\u00a0\u00a0In order to get a deep breath in I would have to try and force a yawn and after several attempts at forcing the yawn I might get lucky as to drawing the breath in.\u00a0\u00a0I have been to the emergency room on numerous occasions and because my pulse ox was always 99 they would basically dismiss me.I also have most relief lying flat on my back with my arms extended so I feel like I am opening up my rib cage.\u00a0\u00a0When I lay on my side I can barely breathe because it is like my rib cage is collapsing and can't expand to get air in.\u00a0\u00a0They have tried me on advair or singular and stuff like that because they said I have asthma (diagnosis which I still don't believe) but it doesn't work or help me out.I was referred to the cardiologist and was told I have Mitrial Valve Prolapse...(Which till today I still don't believe that diagnosis) and was put on lopressa but the medication would drop my blood pressure so low that I couldn't stand up.\u00a0\u00a0So that medication was stopped.\u00a0\u00a0After that they told me I was mental and had anxiety (zoloft, adavant and the one people always get high on), in which I think they told me that because they didn't know what was going on.I am always tired and the things I use to do its kinda hard to do them anymore because I just have no drive, stamina or energy to follow through.\u00a0\u00a0The only other medicine I was on in addition to my insulin was the birth control pills and my doc decided that I should stop them, but I got pregnant that very month...considering I had PolyCysticOvarianSyndrome and paid to have my first two kids, I guess that was a blessing.\u00a0\u00a0I had another baby and she just turned 3.\u00a0\u00a0I am now on Mirena which is a kind of IUD.\u00a0\u00a0My hair is also brittle and combs out no matter how much I do treatments for it.Over the last few months I have started with balance problems in addition to the shortness of breath.\u00a0\u00a0What would happen is when I get up I would have the \"almost\" blackout effect as I would call it, its like I am so disoriented that I just have to hold on, it is not the roller coaster feeling that comes with vertigo but it lasts for about 30-40 seconds and I just have to catch myself so I don't fall.\u00a0\u00a0This has started happening more frequently, when I bend down to wash my face and get back up or bending over to brush my teeth or even just closing my eyes, I sway all over the place.\u00a0\u00a0Its like shutting off an electrical breaker and cutting it back on quickly, so there is like a glitch in the system which cause just a temporary loss of power and then it resumes where it left off.\u00a0\u00a0I also get the dots of flashing lights when this happens and it honestly is just a bad feeling of the constant rocking and swaying motion.I went to my doc for my pap smear a few weeks ago and I told him what was going on and he was like noooooo this is not normal.\u00a0\u00a0They referred me to the Cleveland Clinic over there in Florida. (I am from the islands so medical facilities/ resources aren't the best).\u00a0\u00a0When I went there I had a neurology consult and a cardiology consult.\u00a0\u00a0They did a brain mri and a few other tests.\u00a0\u00a0One of them showed that the pressure in my ears was abnormal and the doctor told me to do therapy to \"train my brain\" to deal with the swaying.....at which I asked him if I was to just live with it?\u00a0\u00a0His response was basically yes.\u00a0\u00a0I was like but I have not lived with this all my life, and I understand the concept of developing a disease and treating it but I know the cause of my diabetes, my pancreas stopped working.\u00a0\u00a0BUT to tell me that I just need to accept it and live with it is unacceptable because we still don't know what is causing it.\u00a0\u00a0I went up to International patients department who scheduled all my appointments etc and busted out crying and requested a second opinion.International Patients sent me to the ENThroat doctor and he recommended some other balance tests etc including a tilt table test but\u00a0\u00a0everyone seems to be missing something because I feel all of the symptoms I am having are tied together.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It has been 6 years now that I have been dealing with this and it is taking a serious toll on me.As it stands all my symptoms are:Rocking and swayingblurry vision on and off- one day I can see clearly and others its blurryshortness of breathsharp pains when drawing a deep breathhair breakageblacking out with out actually blacking outand I usually have a minty feeling within my head, somewhat tinglyMedications I am on:Novolg insulin in the pump- no more than 45 unites per day that includes basal and bolus doses.Mirena- inserted in 2009- has a 5 year durationConfirmed Diagnosis:Diabetic-Type 1PolyCysticOvarian SyndromeRESULTS from Cleveland Clinic Tests:MRI BRAIN and IAC's without and with gadolinium- Their impressions were:1. No enhancing lesions post gadolinium.2. Mildly prominent cisterna magna. Slight asymmetry of the lateral ventricals.3.\u00a0\u00a0Non specific UBO's in the white matter with the largest being about 4-5mm in the medial left temporal lobe. This could represent demyelination, vasculitis, migraine, a normal varient or ischemic change.4.\u00a0\u00a0No evidence of mass or enhancing lesion involving the IAC's on either side.5. Left maxillary sinusitis with hypertrophy of the turbinates.Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) and Electrocochleography ECoG:Their impression:1.\u00a0\u00a0Today's results are most consistent with the normal transmission time through the lower auditory system in both ears; there is no electrophysiological evidence of the VIII nerve or pontine level auditory pathway lesions.2. ECoG examination was ABNORMAL in both ears; presenting electropsysiological evidence of increased labyrinthine pressure in BOTH ears.TESTS they have recommended which are not scheduled until the middle of September:1. Audiogram and eng2. Tilt Table testI know this was long winded...but any help/input would be GREATLY appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Any recommendations for tests, the type doctor to go to, anyone who has experienced this type thing, anyone who knows of anyone who has experienced this type thing......JUST HELP PLEASE.",
