In addition to having diabetes, these people also have thyroid disease and a poorly working adrenal gland.\u00a0\u00a0Some also have other immune system disorders. If you have this syndrome, your child's risk of getting the syndrome including type 1 diabetes is 1 in 2. k is doubled if you developed diabetes before age 11.\u00a0\u00a0If both you and your partner have type 1 diabetes, the risk is between 1 in 10 and 1 in 4.In other words, the risk is very small for women with type 1 diabetes to have type 1 children, but slightly higher if the parent is a type 1 dad. I personally have 2 young adult children and neither have diabetes. I am female.",

            "answer": "The comment posted by stackchips is absolutely incorrect as far as type 1 diabetes goes. It does NOT tend to run in families, skipping generations. In fact, it most often seems to pop out of nowhere, as far as genetics are concerned, with no other type 1 diabetics in the family. Some researchers think that maybe the type 1 person inherits one faulty gene from each non-diabetic parent, and that this may be why it doesn't tend to run in families but pops up randomly.",

            "answer": "well second off, I have had this disease for well over 20 years, which is probably longer than most of you have lived.\u00a0\u00a0also if you do a little researc you can see that diabetes and some glandular diseases are seen to be genetic, and that there is a strong relationship between them, in generations.\u00a0\u00a0Of course you cant go back far enough into all of your families histroy to see if they had any of these diseases, because the technology did not exist to discover these problems, and the fact that many people use to develop type 2 diabetes, and never get diagnosed and would just live their lives with the disease.\u00a0\u00a0Also it has been proven that if you have diabetes your child or your grandchildren, will develop either diabetes or some glandular problem in their future.",

            "answer": "First off, lets not turn this into MySpace...the kid is only like 17...we all have made stupid comments...Second I do have to agree that there really has never been substantial evidence diabetes is solely or definately hereditary. (To my knowledge of course). I have type 1 and NO ONE in either my maternal or paternal sides have ever had type 1 diabetes. So in my case, doctors say it was not hereditary, but most likely due to an illness suffered when I was a child causing antibodies to be out of whack.So I have to say it could be the luck of the draw. Don't let fear of diabetes keep you from having children. Children are a blessing no matter shape, size, or ailment.Good luck and best wishes to you and your new wife.",

            "answer": "I am the mom of one diabetic child and 2 non-diabetic children. There is NO diabetes on either side of our families and the endocrinologist \"suggested\" it may have been caused by the recent popularity of vaccination \"coctails\" I can't include my oldest son in this, since he is 12 years older than my next non-diabetic child. My middle son was given more \"spaced out\" vaccinations and was given the chicken pox vaccination by itself at his next appointment. My next son (who is 4) was given 6 vaccinations at once (3 needles with 2 vaccinations each) AND the chicken pox one at 14 months. 2 months later, he was diagnosed. The combination of \"live\" vaccinations MAY have caused his pancreas to shut down. I met one man who has 4 girls. 3 are diabetic, one is not. The oldest has no diabetic children the others have yet to have children. I think we may be \"on to something\" if we look into how we vaccinate our children these days. I don't think the high rate of diabetes diagnosis is just coincidence. I think if you have good control, and you are careful, your children should be just fine.",
