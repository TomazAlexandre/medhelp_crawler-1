            "answer": "You need to start making food substitutes and using other tricks to help you stay away from sugary carbohydrates without nutritive value.Stop all sugary drinks as they only make you hungry.\u00a0\u00a0Change to water and unsweetened tea.\u00a0\u00a0Or make your own tea and sweeten it with agave nectar as you can control how much you use and it doesn't raise your blood sugar like other sweeteners.\u00a0\u00a0Yet it is natural.At snack time, have a piece of fruit and nothing else.\u00a0\u00a0A banana is fine, or an apple or orange.\u00a0\u00a0Try having a cup of hot tea when you want something. Don't worry about calories when you are having one piece of whole fruit.\u00a0\u00a0It has fiber and nutrition and is filling and the object is to keep you from eating the addicting foods you crave.Fill up your plate with a mix of vegetables and a small piece of lean meat, poultry or fish.\u00a0\u00a0You could have a small potato or small sweet potato now and then, but avoid anything fried, remove skin from poultry.\u00a0\u00a0You may cook with a small amount of butter mixed with olive oil, but avoid batter coatings.\u00a0\u00a0I hear coconut oil is very good for cooking.Once those evil foods are out of your system, which happens after the first week or two, it will get easier.I disagree with the other poster who suggested artificial sweeteners.\u00a0\u00a0These are not healthy and the body still treats them like sugar as far as insulin release.Don't eat fast food.\u00a0\u00a0Avoid desserts.\u00a0\u00a0Avoid packaged foods.\u00a0\u00a0Try to shop in the outside aisles of the grocery store.\u00a0\u00a0Then you cook your own and have more control.\u00a0\u00a0Weight watchers has recipes on line I believe.",
