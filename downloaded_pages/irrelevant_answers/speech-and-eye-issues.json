            "answer": "It is clear that you have undiagnosed medical problems and need a second or third opinion. The problem is not lack of sleep. You need an MRA and an MRI, preferably a 3T, as of yesterday.Many of the problems (slow eye tracking, speech issues) are sometimes linked to cranial nerve palsys, which may be due to diabetes, infection or abnormal growths. Square one is to get an inexpensive HbA1c.With due respects to your neurologist, you need a fresh evaluation by another neurologist, preferably one affiliated with a teaching hospital.",

            "answer": "Ditto what Caregiver said.TwiddleDee, I like that you continue to ask questions, that you're not dismissing what you're noticing in your body.If you stick your tongue out, is it centered, or does it lean to one side?Do you notice big sighs or big inhales more than usual?What does your perceived muscle weakness look like? Unable to hold your arms out in front of you? Legs sometimes weak?Do you know if you have a deficiency of any B vitamins?",

    "question": "I've had some slow eye movement the past year or so. It's weird, my doctor said it was normal, actually my eye movement was above normal, but I have trouble tracking. And a few months ago, I developed some issues speaking. Nothing too noticeable as far as what people hear, but it's a weird feeling to speak. I can't sing because I don't have the breath to hold any notes (I don't feel short of breath in general), and I have issues with words that use the tongue in succession, like \"yesterday,\" for example. It comes out kind of slurred, like I say \"yesrrday.\"I've had some other issues, such as perceived muscle weakness (I feel weak, but the neurologist I saw said I don't have any muscle weakness). He said everything seemed normal, except when I hold my hands out, they kind of move. Not rapidly and they don't flail, but they kind of shift. I have noticed my hands to tremble a bit. It's not anything major.and lastly, the past few days I've been having a weird issue. It's like I can't trust myself for any sort of knowledge. I know people's names, but for some reason I panic and think \"what if I call them what I think their name is and I get it wrong?\" This is people I've known my whole life, like my family and lifelong friends. I just want to get better, I'm so afraid that I could die from whatever this is.My neurologist diagnosed me with lack of sleep (I've always had trouble falling and staying asleep) and serotonin issues. I don't know how this explains my speech issues or eye issues though... it's really worrying.",
