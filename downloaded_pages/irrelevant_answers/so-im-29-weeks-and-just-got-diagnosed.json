            "answer": "I am 36+5 and I have it as well. In the beginning, I'm not going to lie, it's scary. You will have a class to attend and will have to test your blood four times a day. After the first couple of weeks you will get used to the diet, which in all honesty isn't that bad. Just remember to be aware of your starches, sweets, fried foods, and portion control. If you have any more questions you can message me. Good luck and best wishes!",
