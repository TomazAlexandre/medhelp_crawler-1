    "question": "I saw an immunologist today who has diagnosed me with yet another autoimmune disease.\u00a0\u00a0Dermographic urticaria.\u00a0\u00a0It started almost two years ago with swollen, intensely itchy lymph nodes on the back of my head.\u00a0\u00a0That lasted for 34 days.\u00a0\u00a0On the same day that the lymph nodes calmed down, the rashes started.\u00a0\u00a0They were terrible.I took a short course of prednisone early 2010 and that stopped the rashes completely.\u00a0\u00a0After stopping the prednisone, the rashes returned but not to the same degree.My HCV diagnosis was incidental to all this stuff going on, I was just tested for everything to try to figure out what was wrong with me.\u00a0\u00a0My diagnosis came about a year ago.Is anyone aware of any studies that have proven a link between HCV and autoimmune disorders?\u00a0\u00a0Anything I've found uses words like \"controversial\" or \"yet to be proven\".",
