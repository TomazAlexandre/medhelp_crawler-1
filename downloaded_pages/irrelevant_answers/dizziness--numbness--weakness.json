            "answer": "Hello.Since your symptoms were for a short period, we can consider this to be a short vascular episode where the brain did not get sufficient blood supply. You may have had a hypoglycemic attack also. Or there could have been a low blood pressure episode.These are the possibilities that can be ruled out. You should now keep a watch on your symptoms. May be, you can keep a symptom diary. And if you happen to go to a doctor in the future, you can have a good history to tell.Regards",

            "answer": "Thank you Doctor, For your reply and your comment. This has helped reduce he stress caused by the experience. Diabetes does run rampant in my family and has for generations, both my parents died from the disease. I'm 51 years old and in good shape, I've never had medical issues. I recently returned from 18 months in Afghanistan and a complete physical w/bloodwork I had prior to departure did not reveal any health issues. I feel rugged and healthy as a horse which is why such an experience unraveled me. But I think I'm OK now. Thanks, Joe",

This lasted about an hour and then went away but felt e feeling kinda drained/sapped of energy. I have no health insurance and I can't afford to go to the doctor for diagnostics. Has anyone out there had this experience and been diagosed with something? Please enlighten me, I'm worried. Thank you, Joe",
