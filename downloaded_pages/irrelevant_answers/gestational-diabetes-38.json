            "answer": "i was diagnosed just this week too. had alittle melt down too. but the good news is outcomes for mom and baby are great if well monitored. ive just picked up a blood glucose monitor today after seeing my dr. but the last few days have adjusted my diet. avoid sugar is the big thing. so avoid white bread and other starchy vegetables (potatoes). and try and have protein with every meal it helps slow down the absorption of sugar. if you have fruits stick to apples, pears and dark berries. nuts are a great snack and beans are awesome. here's a sample of what ive been doing breakfast - oatmeal with walnuts and cinnamon (also good for regulating blood sugars) snack two hard boiled eggs. snack apple with cheese ( the added protein from the cheese helps slow down the absorption of the sugar from the apple) lunch veggie minestrone soup afternoon snack greek yogurt alittle later veggies and hummus dinner chicken breast mixed green salad with avocado and a glass of milk. i have a fairly good diet to begin with so the changes weren't too hard and i also have a good amount of knowledge on nutrition and have a close friend with diabetes so i know how she eats. and another important part\u00a0\u00a0to stabilize and regulated your blood sugar is too eat frequently which is whats with all the snacks. hope this helps some more.",

            "answer": "I felt like it was alot to eat, too. My diet is 3 small meals and 3 small snacks... For instance for breakfast at 7am 1-2 eggs with 1-2 slices of toast. I check my blood sugars at 9:30am then have a snack snack is usually a small fruit and 1/4 cup of nuts or a cheese stick. 12:00 is Lunch maybe a spinach salad with a spoon of chicken salad or tuna on top and then another snack two hours or so after that when I checky sugars again. Honestly, your diet doesn't have to change drastically. It is just making sure you have protein with your carbs in your meal and that your meal is not a huge portion. I was diagnosed in August and since my numbers are perfect. I do take insulin before bed because my fasting numbers at night get slightly high. It's suppose to be 95 and below before breakfast and usually comes out 96-99 without the insulin. As our baby grows and our hormones rage my fasting levels change, but I know it doesn't have anything to do with me.Try not to stress. Stay away from sugars and keep your portions controlled and you'll be fine.\u00a0\u00a0I have a week left and my little one is so far perfect 83 percentile last checked :) Good luck!",
