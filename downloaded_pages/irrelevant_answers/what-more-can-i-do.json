            "answer": "Erik,(1) From the information provided, no.\u00a0\u00a0Are you at risk for an obsession disorder? Yes.(2) I have no news on this front.\u00a0\u00a0However, you are a poor candidate for a CETP inhibitor as the risk-benefit ratio is not in your favor given your low-risk profile.(3) More than half of all CAD cannot be explained by traditional risk factors, such as smoking and cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0Pursuing a healthy lifestyle, as you are doing with the exercise, is all that I would recommend.\u00a0\u00a0If I was your doctor, a better use of our time to try to improve your longevity would include counseling about smoking avoidance, seat belt use, taking guns out of your home, and avoidance of high-risk weekend activites.Enjoy your weekend.",

    "question": "Dear Dr.I am a 35 year old male. 5'8\" 150 lbs. H/O PVC's and PAC's and an episode of A-Fib 2 years ago. Otherwise healthy. Normal blood pressure 110/70. No Diabetes. No first degree relative with CAD. Just a grandfather with an MI in his forties and a quadruple bypass 5 years ago, now 80 years old.My HDL level was as low as 27 with Total, LDL, TRI all in the low normal range. I have have been fighting to raise my HDL for two years. I lost 45 pounds through exersise and diet. My family doctor agreed to put me on 20 mg Zocor to raise my HDL a little and to keep my LDL and Total Cholesterol low as to improve my Total/HDL ratio. I tried drinking red wine every day but it gave me the A-Fib. I don't think I could tolerate Niaspan with my Acid Reflux problem. My current Regimen is running on treadmill for 40 minutes, six days a week a low fat diet and 12 ounces of Welch's purple grape juice a day. Also, I just had a treadmill test with nuclear scan which was normal. My most recent Lipid profile is......Total-112LDL-53HDL-36*Tri-122My questions are:1)Do you think I am at high risk for CAD based on the information I have given you?2)Any word on when the CETP inhibitors may be released? I can't wait for them!3)If I were your patient, and based on the information I have given you, what more can I do to improve my HDL?Thanks for your time!",
