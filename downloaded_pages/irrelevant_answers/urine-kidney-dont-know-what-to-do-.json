            "answer": "I had an allergy test some time ago for an itching problem.What drew me to the conclusion of 'kidney problems'is the fact that the problem doesn't seem to be exclusive to protein. When i take multi-vitamins for example the urine increases dramatically, breathing tightens etc. Same with fish oils. It's just worse with protein.It seems that my body just isnt absorbing certain things. Mainly protein and vitamins.I've had an allergy test some years ago.------------------------------And to ozark..Thanks, I will request a test. What about the breathing problems? Would this be common in 'diabetes insipidus'.------------------------------I will cut out high protein foods for few days to see how things go",

    "question": "After suspecting i had kidney disease, blood test results show the 'all clear' for kindey/liver/urine. Which is strange as they don't seem like their working properly. If i so much as eat an egg, urine output extreases dramatically, breathing tightens and a breakout in light upper chest pain (Liver area) sets in.And all this started when i started taking a protein supplement, which i stopped when symptoms came.I also have Sickle cell disease, something that effects my red cells ability to transport oxygen around the body efficiently, possibly leaving certain organs that bit more vuneralble. And though i did wet the bet untill my mid teens (possible reduced renal?)i have had no major problems.I did a 24 hour urine sample at the request of my doctor, and filled up to 2 and a half liters on little fulids, yet my doc says it's fine, but I'm 100% sure there is something wrong.My question is this... Is it possible that i have partial kidney funtion that has been brought to the surface by me taking a protein supplement? My creatinine level is 69umol, what could this tell me about my eGFR and the level of my kidney funtion? What can i do?All feedback deeply appreciated.Side EffectsExsessive/EXTREME Urine output.(Especially after protein or animo acid rich food.) No bloodSlight Diarrhea every other day.Slight soft pain in upperchest (Liver/heart area) mainly after mealtimes/snacks.Weight loss.Tight Breathing (mainly after mealtimes/snacks).I have no allergies, take no drugs and do not drink.",
