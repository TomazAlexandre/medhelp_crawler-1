            "answer": "Dear Danny,People with diabetes are more prone to having Cellulitis, which normally appears on the feet or legs but can appear elsewhere. This may have been the sign that your doctor was following. But the diagnosis of diabetes can't be verified without a blood test. Good luck with your search.bret",

            "answer": "I have two teenage sons (non-diabetic) who both developed skin marks similar to what you describe in your son. They were also 14 years old when they developed these striae(medical term for the marks). We have two type 1 diabetics in the family; one of whom is their brother.When the doctor saw these striae he had them photographed and referred for testing for Cushing's Syndrome as this can be one of the signs along with a raised blood glucose level. Whilst the striae are unsightly, I am glad to say that my sons are otherwise healthy, and some fading of the marks has occurred with time for my older son. My guess is that your doctor is being cautious and testing to rule out Cushing's syndrome in your son which does have one or two symptoms in common with diabetes.I found helpful information online by researching \"striae\" and \"Cushings Syndrome\". It might be worth asking your doctor exactly what his concerns are and what he is looking for.Good luck! I wish you well.I would be interested to hear the outcome.",

    "question": "I have a 14 year old son whom had a sports physical today. One of the first things the doctor noticed was an excessive amout of stretch marks in his bicep, shoulder and back area. he is in good physical condition and looking forward to trying out for football for the first time.Upon seeing these marks, the doctor immediatley ordered tests stating concern about diabetes. Now I have good faith in our family doctor and believe if he is concerned there is a reason, yet I find no mention of skin related symptoms anywhere.Any ideas what he is seeing or why he would be concerned? I really want to read up on this so my wife and I can be as educated as possible.Thank you in advance for any input.Danny",
