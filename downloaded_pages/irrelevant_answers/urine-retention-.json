            "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear about the ongoing voiding issues. :Please try not to be discouraged or frightened, let's see what info we can give you to fill in the blanks a bit. What kind of physician did the procedure (gynecologist, urologist, urogyn)? In this time frame if the surgery went well you should be beyond self-cathing unless there are other health issues that are impacting repair like diabetes (if you have diabetic neuropathy, improperly firing nerve impulses may be impacting the contraction of spinchter and voiding process). Have you discussed this with the physician who did the surgery? In general heal curve can run between 6-12 weeks depending on what repairs are done and what degree of POP existed but by week 6 you should be well on your way to healed.I'm hoping you did not do any heavy lifting or vacuuming post surgery, sometimes that can create problems post surgery. Even lifting grandbabies is a no-no.If the physician who did the surgery was not a urogynecologist, you might want to consider a 2nd opinion on what is going on. Please send more details on backdrop and I'll see what other insights I can give you. Hang in there hon!Sher",

            "answer": "Hi! I had urine retention and hesitancy before my prolapse repair (similar surgery to yours) and had thought it would go away after. But no, it still occurred. I started working with a certified pelvic physical therapist who has been able to make a huge difference in the problem. There is a lot going on with tension in the pelvic muscles, trigger points, pressure, bloating, intestines, etc and so on that can all effect (crap or is is affect?) the ability to urinate. I highly recommend you find someone certified in this. Not just anyone that does pelvic PT but someone actually specifically certified in it. She has been able to do FAR more to help me than even the urogyn has.",

            "answer": "lealea is absolutely right on the money, there is a huge difference between a PT who is certified in pelvic floor and one who is not. MRSA is such a scary scenario and there is no doubt is impacting your heal curve. Dosing with so many antibiotics to get it under control can be so invasive to your normal bodily function. Please make sure to either take probiotics or eat yogurt to balance the flora in your stomach (antibiotics kill off good bacteria which enables the yeast to grow, the probiotics and yogurt replace the good bacteria for balance). If you have infection, you may have internal inflammation which is impacting everything down there function wise. I encourage you to allow as much air as possible to get to the area, if you can sleep with no undies on, it will help-that area of our\u00a0\u00a0bodies retains moisture which encourages bacterial growth.Urine retention is a classic sign of more progressive POP prior to surgery but should not be there after you have completed heal curve post surgery if there are no complications. I am hopeful a urogyn can guide you with this to get the heal process complete; most good urogyns work with and can recommend a good pelvic floor PT. If not let me know, I have a source for finding both urogyns and PTs certified in pelvic floor I can refer you to. For now it is vital to get the MRSA healed up; it will be difficult to get to balance while that is going on.Please keep us in the loop as things progress.Sher",
