            "answer": "i wanted to ask you about psvt. Had a an echo test structually sound heart ef of 65. During periods of strenuous exersize or work i notice the speeding of my heart. Told by regular doctor just anxiety, no kidding. Was told by cardio to take bb but not sure if i should because ive been so scared about it not sure it may be fear driven. Could this be possible? Going to second cardio for another opinion. Thank you very much.",

            "answer": "The reason im not sure of bb is because my resting heart rate can be as low as 48.I read one of your previous post and found it informative about this and exersize.I think the fear of not totaly understanding that they say it wont hurt you can drive it.I to have kept exersizeing even though it scares me.I FELT IF I DIDNT THE FEAR WOULD BE MUCH GREATER!!.I have been told it is nothing to worry about,but it sure does not feel that way when its going on.thanx",

            "answer": "I hope you are able to come to grips with your fear. It must be very hard. My only comment about medication is that BB's have very real side effects and are being phased out as first line HTN treatment. So , obviously your doctor is the first person to consult, but BB's have nasty side effects that include inducing diabetes in some people.\u00a0\u00a0My very anxious mother had diabetes after years of Toprol use ( I further suspect her BP only goes up when she's at the doctor) and she is active and weighs only 108 pounds. She should not have type 2 diabetes, neither of her parents had it, so it's not genetic.If one is not \"structurally\" ill perhaps one should consider discussing alternate therapies for the anxiety with the physician.",

Im hopeing this doctor is more talkative.I did not know what psvt meant but it sure scared the hell out of me!!! my gp said dont worry it is due to stress?I still have not convinced myself it is nothing but im getting closer.thanx",
