            "answer": "HI,A small splurge once in a while is likely okay as long as the servings size is within reason and it doesn't become a habit( for example a \"splurge\" of cake with ice cream every night is not a good idea). Watching your fat and carb intake during the rest of the day is a good idea as well. So enjoy your birthday cake, but keep in mind the big picture too :-)",

    "question": "A few months ago I was diagnosed with PCOS, and I'm insulin resistant.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor told me that I need to go on Metformin and a low-glycemic index diet to avoid getting type 2 diabetes (and other problems) in the future.\u00a0\u00a0So I have been on 500mg of Metformin daily, and I've followed a low-glycemic index diet.\u00a0\u00a0I recently went back for testing and all of my levels are back to normal.\u00a0\u00a0My question is, every once in a while, if I want to splurge, is it ok?\u00a0\u00a0For example, could I have a slice of chocolate cake and a scoop of ice cream on my birthday, as long as I restrict carbs and sugars for the rest of the day?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
