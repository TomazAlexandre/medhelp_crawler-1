My PCP had me do endoscopy with a GI and found an ulcer in my esophogus...........have you gone that route......I would think your doctor would have you admitted and find this problem ASAP with the blood coughing...........Keep the faith",

    "question": "I am a 56 year old woman.\u00a0\u00a0Recently diagnosed with stage 2 Sarcoidosis.\u00a0\u00a0My cat scan and xrays have shown granulomas for the last two years and recent shadows and several changes in the lungs.\u00a0\u00a0Lung function tests were very poor.I was also told that I have fluid around the heart.\u00a0\u00a0I had been diagnosed with fluid around the heart two years ago as well which subsided without treatment.My doctor is planning to treat the Sarcoidosis with very large long term doses of Prednisone (60 mg per day).\u00a0\u00a0I am currently awaiting an appointment with an endocrinologist to rule out diabetes before taking the Prednisone.My symptoms started in January 08 after I had a Niessen Wrap (Fundoplication) surgery.Symptoms are coughing up blood, frequent heart palpitations, extreme shortness of breath, chest discomfort among other things.The coughing up blood is still continuing.\u00a0\u00a0Most often in the sputum, but three times it has been a large amount of bright red clotty blood.\u00a0\u00a0On those occasions I woke up at night with a gurgling sound in my chest and had to cough up the blood.I also have extremely itchy skin, lesions on the torso which have been recurring every year and lasting for five to six months.I have been on inhalers for three years for asthma but now the doctor thinks my asthma like symptoms may be caused by the sarcoidosis and not asthma.I am still taking inhalers but experience extreme shortness of breath with an exertion or walking even half a block.Question:\u00a0\u00a0This sounds like a mess.\u00a0\u00a0Should I be checked for sarcoidosis in other organs besides the lungs?\u00a0\u00a0What about the fluid around the heart?\u00a0\u00a0How concerned should I be?This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/252147\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/252147</a>.",
