            "answer": "Hi,It will help us know what all tests have you undergone. Did you undergo an MRI of brain? These symptoms of leg pain, tingling numbness may be due to peripheral neuropathy which can occur due to diabetes, thyroid deficiency and B 12 deficiency. It is important to rule out these causes.Easy bruising can occur due to fall in platelets, coagulation disorders and certain poisonings. This requires further evaluation. I would suggest you to get it done at your earliest. In the meantime you can try B 12 supplements and see if they help.Keep us posted.",

    "question": "Nerve tics, tingling, pins and needles, leg pain, bruises...?About a month ago I fainted for less then a minute at the train station, I went to a neurologist who sent me to a cardiologist, I was diagnosed with vasovagal syncope. Ever since, I drink lots of fluids and vitamin water. But now, I noticed I get visual disturbances from time to time. Not only that, I feel nerve tics and tingling Sensations throughout my body, like my legs, feet, arms, hands, face and lips. I get headaches about 3 times a week. At times my scalp hurts. I also realized that there are times in which I feel the tingling sensations on my face and neck even my throat when I get into bed. One of the most bothersome symptoms are the leg pains I have. First it was only my right thigh, then the whole leg, now it's both legs and even my heels. I noticed I have bruises on my thighs. At times, even my lower back and buttocks hurt. I wanted to blame stress and anxiety for all this but I know my body and all this is strange. Also, I get nauseous for no reason.\u00a0\u00a0At first I thought it was muscle pain, but this has been this way for two weeks now and it's getting worse.\u00a0\u00a0600 mg motrin has done nothing for me.\u00a0\u00a0I had migranes before, about 4 years ago with similiar symptoms but I didn't have any leg pain at all.",
