            "answer": "My step mother is 4'11\", she delivered a 10 pound baby and an 11 pound baby.\u00a0\u00a0So size is not the main issue, it has to do with whether your pelvic opening is big enough for your baby.\u00a0\u00a0Take your hubby with you to your apt, he will be a good visual aid as you explain your concerns.And a c-cestion is not the worst thing that can happen during childbirth.\u00a0\u00a0I so understand you want to deliver vaginally and I hope that works out for you.Try not to borrow trouble from tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0Your baby will be here soon, focus on that!",

    "question": "Anyone having a big baby?\u00a0\u00a0I am 33 weeks and so far have had 3 ultrasound the last one last monday showing the baby at almost 5 lbs...he wants to do another one at 36 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I passed my gestational diabetes check with flying colors...but my husband is 6ft6 and I am 5ft2,\u00a0\u00a0I kind of expected it to be a big baby, he was 12 lbs at birth (my husband).\u00a0\u00a0 My OB is okay I have no complaints except he has a busy practice and will tell me the same things over and over again at each visit.\u00a0\u00a0Like my back pain...at first he addressed it then backed off (for 2 visits he gave me helpful sigestions and and wanted me on leave, then the next it was like our converations never happened) I finally went to my family doctor who put me on leave becasue of the increase of pain, numbness and baby size.\u00a0\u00a0My fear is that I will have a c-section, I told him that is my fear but I kinda felt it went in one ear and out the other. I guess I shouldn't complain becasue he is doing a fourth ultrasound, but I have this fear he will sit on it until my 40th week and I will be forced into a C section becasue the baby will be to big.Anyone else have these fears or experinces...I hope this post isn't to vague.",
