            "answer": "Hi,Your fasting glucose may be 95, which is still at the high end of normal, but your hba1c of 6.4, gives you an average blood sugar of about 150, which is well above normal.\u00a0\u00a0If you wait until your hba1c is 7.0, this will give you an average blood sugar of close to 180, nearly double normal.\u00a0\u00a0There is much consensus that the risk of heart disease rises significantly as hba1c increases above 5.0.\u00a0\u00a0Given that you already have a history of heart disease, I believe that your cardiologist is quite correct in wanting to be sure that your blood sugar is normalized / as close to truly normal as possible.Metformin / Glucophage is first line treatment for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It helps sensitize your body to insulin and seems to be a very helpful drug.A normal non-diabetic hba1c is < 5.0, with ideal probably being in the mid 4s, with average blood sugars of about 100, which will include fasting numbers of 70 - 90 range, and post eating of 80 - 120 range.\u00a0\u00a0Where I am a person can already be officially diagnosed with diabetes with a hba1c of 5.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ADA line that people with diabetes can safety have a Hba1c of 7.0 is wrong, though there is new advice that people with diabetes should get their hba1c down as close to normal as they safely can.Would suggest you take all measures; exercise, low carb diet, medication, to get your hba1c as close as you can to 5, or ideally mid-4s.\u00a0\u00a0Further would also suggest that you get a blood sugar meter and starting testing about 1.5 - 2 hours after eating.\u00a0\u00a0Your target blood sugar 2 hours after eating should be ideally < 120 (the close to fasting the better), and definitely not higher than 140.\u00a0\u00a0The results of your testing after meals will let you see the effects of different foods and help guide your meal choices.Learn about diabetes, and it's management.\u00a0\u00a0Bernstein Diabetes University on U-tube has lectures which can be useful.\u00a0\u00a0Bernstein is a very strong advocate of normalizing blood sugars for people with diabetes.",

            "answer": "As sally said\u00a0\u00a0a fasting of 95 is OK BUT an A1c of 6.4 means that you are running high BG after meals.\u00a0\u00a0and high BG is not good.\u00a0\u00a0Carbohydrates raise BG.\u00a0\u00a0Get a BG meter (walmart has a cheep one) and test your BG 1 hour and 2 hours after eating your biggest carb meal of the day and see what is says.",

            "answer": "Hi Bob,when you start metformin (unless it is extended release), you need to start it slowly.\u00a0\u00a0You might start with 1/4 tablet / day for a few days, then 1/2 then 1 whole.\u00a0\u00a0Some people get gastric upset /diarrhea when starting metformin.\u00a0\u00a0By starting it slowly you can avoid this.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For most people this side effect is only temporary.Let us know how you go.",

    "question": "My latest blood test (fairly in line with recent tests) indicates I have a serum glucose level of 95 which is high normal, not even pre-diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0My A1C number is 6.4 which is high pre-diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0From what I have read, most medical sources do not recommend medication treatment until the A1C reaches 7.0.\u00a0\u00a0My GP who orders the test said nothing about diabetes medication with these numbers.\u00a0\u00a0However, my cardiologist wants me take Metaformin 500 MG.\u00a0\u00a0When I ask my GP about this,he is evasive.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t think he wants to get caught in the middle.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t understand why a cardiologist should be ordering diabetes medicine for me rather than my GP.I have carotid artery disease and have a stent.\u00a0\u00a0It has been explained to me that my cardiologist is being aggressive in his treatment because of this.\u00a0\u00a0Still, I don\u2019t understand why a person with a glucose range in the normal range should be taking diabetes medication at this point, and with an A1C reading still in the pre-diabetes range.\u00a0\u00a0(I also don\u2019t understand why the two readings conflict like this.)I\u2019m an accountant by occupation, but I\u2019m also a writer of short stories with periodical credits.\u00a0\u00a0If an editor wants to make changes to my work on simple editorial matters, I don\u2019t object.\u00a0\u00a0But if he or she wants to make substantive changes, then I do object.\u00a0\u00a0As the author, I have the final say on such matters.\u00a0\u00a0I try to be cooperative with my physicians, but I maintain that when it comes to my body, I have the final say.\u00a0\u00a0I worry about taking too many medications and especially taking ones that might seem unnecessary.\u00a0\u00a0Any insights would be most appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
