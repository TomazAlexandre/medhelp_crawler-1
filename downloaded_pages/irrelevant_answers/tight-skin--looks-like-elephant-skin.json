They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder.\u00a0\u00a0It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided.
