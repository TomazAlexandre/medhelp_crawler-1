            "answer": "I do exercise as well. It's just I can't seem to eat. I don't like the way food even feels moving/digesting through my stomach. I panic when I feel it. Starvation just feels right to me, going on 40 days of not eating feels right. Now that I've gotten this far I just don't want to start eating again. Even if I do eat again how am I going to transition from one to the other. Then throw into it the \"freak out\" over stomach digesting my food. Thanks for responding I appreciate it. I've had many blood tests recently (including fasting glucose and such) and all my metabolic panels looks normal. That just makes me think (irrationally I'm sure) that \"wow, if I'm ok, then I should just keep on\". It's such a vicious cycle.",

    "question": "I am still considered \"obese\". However I have lost over 110 pounds recently. I severely restrict my intake. At this point on I'm on day 27 without eating more than a few hundred calories a day. (300-400 tops). For 18 of those days I didn't eat anything at all. I have about 80 pounds until I'm in the BMI for my height/weight ratio.So what do I have? I do purge on occasion, but it's a rareity. I just starve. Period.",
