            "answer": "A pituitary lesion can cause your hormones to be abnormal.Was your MRI with and without contrast, and did they take pictures during the injection of the dye? Is your doctor a neuro-endocrinologist? Are they testing all your hormones? Was that the only one that was abnormal? What about the other pituitary hormones?",

            "answer": "It is best to see a neuro-endocrinologist. As you have experienced, not just any neurologist knows pituitary lesions, and you may find that not just any endocrinologist knows them as well. Most endos just treat diabetes and thyroid disorders. But an MRI wiithout contrast is not what is ordered for pituitaries. What is ordered is a dynamic MRI - with and without as well as pictures during the injection of contrast to see if there are abnormalities in uptake.I do hope it goes well for you.",

            "answer": "Did something happen to make you feel anxious (other than what was happening)?If it was anxiety, then the situation would set it off, not get anxious from what is happening which kinda would be normal.Look up thyroid storm. Since your TSH is so low, your body may from time to time realize this and suddenly kick in and give you a jolt of thyroid, and then your body may have regulated itself. That could be one reason. Not sure, but maybe.I hope they can come up with ideas. Sounds awful.",
