            "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I don't think there is anything medically significant in your echo findings. Just do all you can to maintain a healthy lifestyle and i'm sure you have a much better chance than your dad did. Words like like trivial/mild are usually no cause for concern. Have an echo in 2-3 years time and see what happens, if new symptoms develop or what you have now seem to get worse then repeat sooner. Good luck.",

    "question": "thanks for taking my question. i'm 51, went to the doctor and had\u00a0\u00a0different bood pressure reading in my left and right arms. the doctor recommened a transthoracic echocardiography. i was hoping you could translate the results in laymans terms. my doctor is korean and i have a hard time understanding her. i'll give you the summary, normal left ventricular size, mild global LV systolic dysfunction. LV ejection fraction is 51 to 54%. RV size and function are normal. Valvular function is normal. Mild Aortic Root dilatation, no evidence of Coarctation of Aorta. Is this tpyical of someone my age? Other than this I've\u00a0\u00a0never had any health problems.\u00a0\u00a0I don't smoke but i do drink about 6 to 12 beers a week.The only medicine i take daily is zyrtec-d.I don't have a high stress job anymore, i use to run my own construction business(20 years) now i work for the state(water plant operator). Also been married to the same woman for 26 years and have two grown boys out of college, one home,a little stress. My father died of a massive heart attack at sixty(22 years of diabetes and hard work)and my mother had a major stroke after his death,and has almost made a full recovery,grandkids helped.Am I headed down the same road? Can I do something about this with out meds? thanks again for your time, matt c",
