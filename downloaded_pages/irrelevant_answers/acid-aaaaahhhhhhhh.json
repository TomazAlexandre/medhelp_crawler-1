            "answer": "A) Please see your doctor as soon as possible.B) You have a lot of physical problems going on and really need to get checked.1) If you feel you are anemic (you said possibly lo of blood), you need to ask for complete blood count and ask for ferritin and iron saturation to be checked also.2) Your urine is concentrated, which sounds like you may be dehydrated and they may need to give you IV fluids if you are unable to drink adequate fluids with your celiac symptoms and sore tummy.\u00a0\u00a0You also should get your electrolytes checked for imbalances due to poor nutrition.3) Are you regularly monitoring your blood sugar level?\u00a0\u00a0Do you self medicate for your diabetes, based on these levels?4) You say you are freezing- what is your temperature?5) Are you getting treated for your hypothyroidism and thyroid levels regularly monitored?6)Have they checked a blood gastrin level to rule out something rare called Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which can cause too much acid to be produced?",

            "answer": "On point three, I looked up UK normal levels for children with type1 diabetes:Before eating: 4 to 8 mmol/l2 hours post eating: under 10 mmols/lSo, if your number is over 9 before you've had a meal, you likely already know that's too high, while if that's your number after eating, it's ok.When you took your temperature, was it with the old mercury-type under the tongue thermometer?\u00a0\u00a0If so, did you leave the thermometer under your tongue on one side or the other for at least 3 and 1/2 minutes?\u00a0\u00a0If your temperature really was 30.6 C, when I used a program to compute that into Farenheit, which is what we use in the United States, I would be surprised you were still living with such a low temperature of 87.08!About the thyroid- do you mean your TSH is at 1.0?What they gave you was a proton pump inhibitor, which is supposed to help reduce your acid production in your stomach and fibrogel looks to be the same as Metamucil in the United States, which is a bulk forming laxative, thus treating you whether you have unformed stools with your celiac or constipation (but it sounds like your thyroid condition is well-treated and so hopefully constipation is not an issue for you).Retake your temperature- get a parent or guardian to help you.\u00a0\u00a0If your temperature is really that low, have them take you to hospital as I believe that is an emergency situation.\u00a0\u00a0And if you do feel you are not getting enough fluid on your own, that is another emergency situation where you need to be taken in for adequate hydration.",
