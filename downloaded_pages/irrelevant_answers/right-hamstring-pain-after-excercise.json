            "answer": "Hello,Some of the important causes of pain in hamstrings while running are overextension of the muscles,overweight,prolonged standing during the day,dehydration, alterations in the balance of salts in the bloodstream (such as a high or low sodium,calcium or potassium level),neuropathy(esp in diabetes),hypothyroidism,peripheral vascular disease(narrowing of the leg arteries which causes poor circulation),sarcoidosis,excess alcohol,nerve compression, and sometimes liver disease.Some of these causes like dehydration,being overweight,alcohol intake and prolonged standing are modifiable by efforts of the patient. Stretching and massaging the affected muscle before and after running can provide relief.Warm compresses and painkiller such as paracetamol may help to ease muscle discomfort and tenderness that sometimes persists for up to 24 hours after symptoms appear.My advise is to consult a physician and rule out the above medical conditions by thorough investigations as without physical examination and investigations, pinpointing a diagnosis is tough.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted if you have any additional queries.",

            "answer": "I tore my semimembranous tendon of my hamstring back in July. It was confirmed by an MRI.\u00a0\u00a0It is the worst tendon of the hamstring to tear and takes a good 6 months to really heal. The thing is it is going to heal using its own scar tissue.\u00a0\u00a0So you want the best healing scar tissue as possible.\u00a0\u00a0TRUST ME\u00a0\u00a0LET IT HEAL.\u00a0\u00a0It is not worth injuring it more.\u00a0\u00a0I am doing physical therapy and active release therapy which helps to relieve the tendon and the pain.",

    "question": "I am desperate for help here.I *want* to jog/run, BUT, everytime I do anything on the treadmill or on the road, my right hamstring hurts like bloody hell.\u00a0\u00a0I walked 3.5 miles the day before and I'm still icing/heating the muscle.\u00a0\u00a0If I jog, I practically blow out the muscle.I thought perhaps my right leg was longer and purchased a lift for my left heel.No change.I'll be 30 this year and I'm in otherwise good health.I stretch *lightly* beforehand and *really well* afterwards.Can a muscle actually be shorter?I'm plumb out of ideas. Help please.",
