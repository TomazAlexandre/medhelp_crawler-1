            "answer": "I was told I have eczema, and also did a lot of reading on the subject. I also have a problem in the groin region. I don't itch and there is no scales or dried skin. The skin just turns red and burns.The pain is intense at times. Sometimes it only lasts for minutes sometimes for hours. The skin also gets sticky when it's really bad.I was wondering if he has the typical symptoms. They say it always presents with extremely itchy skin which turns red and scaly and only hurts if it flares and bleeds.I talked with a lot of people that have been able to control there eczema by controlling sugar. They stick to a fruit and vegetable diet. By making there bodies more alkiline.Read some articles on alkiline diets. But don't fall into the trap of ionized water. They sell extremely over priced water filters. designed to increase the ph of water.Your body regulates the ph automatically. I'll try to find a link to a web site of a women that is able to control her eczema. She is a dermatologist who is currently fighting the current thinking that all eczema is caused by the immune system and therefor can't be controlled with diet.",

            "answer": "What you have sounds like what my husband has. His skin just turns red and blisters out. It is so itchy that he is scrathing everywhere during his sleep that I feel obligated to stay awake and stop him if he scratches too much. His skin is not scaly or flaky like how eczema is often described. And yes, it burns too, he keeps saying that \"My skin hurts so much\". The problem with him is he hates most of the fruits and most of the vegetables. Making him to eat anything green is almost impossible.I have read about the alkaline versus acidicity of the body that may caused skin inflammation. I dont know whether I should say this but I read somewhere that there is no truth to it. Our body always have a system to control the blood PH. Eating something alkaline or acidic does not make the blood or thebody anymore alkaline or acidic. The article also mentioned that what people claimed 'eating more fruits and veggie' to be helping them is not the fact they make the body more alkaline but the fect that they are getting enough minerals and vitamins in their diet.Anymore insights to this problem is always welcomed. .",

            "answer": "I don't get blisters and I don't itch. I always try to read both sides but over the years I have lost confidence in the medical community. Especially when they say that they don't know what causes it in the first place. You can get ph strips and compare. When I started my ph was 6 average for a week. I started eating better and now it is 7.Your body can only use what you put in it.\u00a0\u00a0I am not to fond of vegetables but will become a vegetarian if it makes this go away.I haven't had time to find that article but, She has a lot of data to back up her claims. Also there is a book I read. The Pro Biotic Revolution by Gary Hufnagle. He talks about disease like eczema and the causes. He said that over 70% of the immune system is in the digestive tract. The more vegetables and pre biotic food that you eat. The better your immune system. He talks about good bacteria and the need for it. That only the modern world has eczema. Saying we caused it by being to clean using antibiotic for everything.",

    "question": "Hi,My husband has atopic eczema that has been going on for more than 3 years. It started off with scaling on his hands which spread to all over his body. We have ruled out that it is not contact dermatitis eczema since it occurs all over his body - typical areas include on the back, on the groin, on his butt, thighs, upper arms and calves. Since his eczema started on his late twenties, I know that the chances are that he will have to deal with this for the rest of his life.We have done everything we could. I\u00a0\u00a0made him try the supplement of vitamins and minerals for skin health like Vitamin C, A, E, Primrose Oil, Fish Oil, Zinc and Lactobasilus Bifidus over 4-5 months course but to no avail. We also use all special skin sensitives soap for him but the eczema keeps coming back. Based on my research, I\u00a0\u00a0know using steroid pills for a long time will impair the kidneys and possibly lead to all related weakenned-immune system issues like fungal/viral infection, so I kept him off steroid pills and keep him on anti-histamine. The problem is, since the eczema keep coming; so he has to be on anti-histamine religiously - day and nite doses. Apart from oral medication, he is also on Elomet and Clovate cream. My question is:1) Will taking daily dosage of anti-histamine (cetrizine) in a long period will do any damage to his organs like liver or kidneys?2) WIll the usage of Clovate/Elomet over long period of time will give any bad effects like thinning of the skin or more serious falre up of eczema.3) Will diabetes make the eczema worse? I think my husband is in borderline diabetic (not sure). The last time I made him tested for glucose, he has been fasted for more than 14 hours and glucose test came out at 5 mmol/L. For me it is pretty high but to make him go on low-sugar diet is pretty difficult since he is naturally stubborn person. :)4) Does occuring eczema indicates more serious problem that just over-reacting immune system for e.g. liver problems or kidneys problem?Please help me. I am very concern wife, I hate to see him suffer and I wish there is something I can do to make the eczema goes away. I have tons of research and listes above are all the questions I cant get the answer directly from any written source over the internet. Thank you!",
