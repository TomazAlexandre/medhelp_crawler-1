            "answer": "There must be some misunderstanding as a valve leakage should not stop an operation but if necessary repair or replace.I am reading between the lines but I believe what has happened your father is in heart failure mode evidenced by fluid retention.\u00a0\u00a0When an indivdual has a low EF (amount of blood pumped into circulation with each heartbeat) the heart usually enlarges inadditon to lower cardiac output...an enlarged heart can result in causing valve leakage.Your father should be hospitalized to reduce swelling (fluid retention) or given medication: a diuretic to reduce fluids, (fluid retension causes the heart to work harder), medication to dilate vessels (relieves some work stress on the heart...reduces blood pressure) and medication to increase heart contractions enabling the heart to pump more blood into circulation with each heartbeat.\u00a0\u00a0This will give the heart time to recovery and the relief may reduce valve leakage.If after this treatment and the heart has reduced in size and cardiac output (EF at the very least above 29%, requires an echo) is increased then a decision can be made and what options are a vailable.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes requires treatment as well.",
