    "question": "I've started having a numb/tingling sensation in my hands and feet. Also just weird sensations when I touch parts of my body. In my hands it could be several fingers or one finger, and can have sharp pain from my elbow down. My hands and feet feel like they are wearing socks or thin gloves. I've started to notice tremors as well in my hands. I've got a buzzing spot on the left side of my foot that will buzz for a second or two then quit and start again. I haven't been sleeping well due to these symptoms waking me up, and I feel like somebody beat me with a bat when I wake up. I've been sent to cardiologist and they found I had PACs and a murmur, but nothing serious. I've recently seen an Optometrists because I had some focus problems, but he said my eyes were perfect. Possible the meds I am taking. I've recently had a MRI of my head with and w/o contrast. All came back normal. All these symptoms seem to kinda come and get worse as time has started. This all started happening last month, first of novemember when I was under alot of health anxiety due to palpations and shortness of breath. Could this just be anxiety/stress, or an autoimmune problem? It's been over a month with no signs of improving. I've been taking Xanax, but it doesn't seem to help, just calm me down from worrying. I've seen a chiropractor as well. He done X-Rays of my neck and lowerback which he thinks could be causing the problem with the tingling/numbess. I think it was along the C5/C6 in my neck. Any help would be great.",
