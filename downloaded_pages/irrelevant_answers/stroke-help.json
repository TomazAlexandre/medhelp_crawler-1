My mother in-law is concerned about his penis because it is reseeding in, to the point that when he needs to use the washroom that his wife needs to help with they both have a difficult time trying to get it out in time since he has little controll over is bladder. I was wondering what causes this and if there is anything that can help him. He is on a lot of meds so something that does not involve a lot of medicine to help him would be greatly appreciated.",
