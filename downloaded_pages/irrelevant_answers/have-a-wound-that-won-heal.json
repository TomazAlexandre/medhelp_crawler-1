            "answer": "Hi,for a nonhealing wound you should see your doctor for expert care and advice, particularly that your home remedies haven't worked.I believe that cortisone would be no help if there is an infection (could make it worse)...Very good control of your blood sugar would also be required, i assume you have diabetes.If you cna't afford to see a Dr. at least go talk to a pharmacist to see what would be appropriate care and they could tell you if you should go to a dr. or not.",

I am also\u00a0\u00a0diabetic. If your wound will not heal don't wait too long see your doctor. I had a cut that took weeks to heal. Infection comes very easy!",
