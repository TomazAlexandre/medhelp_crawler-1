            "answer": "Well with the negative test I see nothing that is going to indicate a STD really. It could be other bacteria not STD related causing the issue that is why seeing a Dr is a better option then buying that screening test having it come out negative then having to see a Dr. Just spending more money and taking more time to get diagnosed.",

            "answer": "Hmm sounds like you could possibly have a yeast infection? You need to get a culture done on the day you have this discharge so it can be properly diagnosed. Don't keep putting this off, regardless of what type of infection it is you need to see a healthcare professional asap. Make sure you drink plenty of water and take a multivitamin so this infection doesn't leave you feeling lousy.How is your diet? Are you at risk for diabetes or have a family history of it? If you intake a lot of sugary foods try to eliminate them and white breads, because if it is a yeast infection the sugar is feeding the overgrowth.",

            "answer": "Yeast infection discharge can be various colors, white, yellow, green etc... a foul fishy smell can also be associated with a yeast infection. Some claim that you can treat at home, but if this has been going on for some time I would consult a physician immediately and unfortunately most treatments for yeast infections that are in stores are more for women. Get to a doctor, I only say this because you may have a huge yeast over growth that can't be treated without antibiotics. Things to do in the mean time, are to keep the area clean, and dry completely when coming out of the shower. You can go to the health food store and purchase apple cider vinegar - fill the tub up enough to cover your groin area and add 2 cups of vinegar to the water, soak for about 30 minutes. If it's a yeast infection you aren't getting the proper nutrients you need either that why I recommended going to the store to get a basic vitamin to take daily. People with diabetes are prone to getting persistent yeast infections as well, cut out all sources of sugar to starve the bad yeast. this means stop eating soda, breads, pastas etc.... switch to gluten free products. Try www.plannedparenthood.org to look up std/yeast infection information.",

    "question": "Hi there, I recently had sti testings for chamydia and gonorrea these both came back negative, i did everything spot on waited a while before i got tested and so on. the reason for getting tested is i once pulled my foreskin back and noticed a green like liquid, and a different stronger smell and my penis head was all red. every day i do this and check sometimes theres no greeny discolour but my penis head always seems to be very red. Also now and again one of my testicles has a minor pain for a few seconds, but this greeny discharge comes every 2 or 3 days and then goes for a day or so this is very weird any ideas as i was negative on both gonorea and clamydia tests... please help im so worried!!!! thankyou",
