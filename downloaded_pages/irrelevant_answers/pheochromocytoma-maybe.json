            "answer": "If you have a pheochromocytoma, your adrenal glands can produce too much of certain hormones, raising your blood pressure and heart rate. A pheochromocytoma may be life-threatening if unrecognized or untreated.Hello...A \"24-hour urinary catacholamines and metanephrines\" should be done. This test looks for adrenaline and the break-down products of adrenaline. Since the body gets rid of these hormones in the urine, those testing will need to collect their urine for 24 hoursThe episodes can occur as frequently as 20 times or, as randomnly as once every few months. Episodes can last a few minutes, several hours or days. Over secretion of catecholamines can lead to persistent high blood pressure or wild fluctuations in your blood pressure. Besides the hypertension other symtptoms may include: headaches, profuse sweating, rapid heart rate, anxiety, pain in the lower chest or abdomen, nausea, heat intolerance and pale skin.Occurrance of a pheochromocytoma is usually rare but not unheard of. SInce you have many of the hallmark symptoms, you should insist that your Dr run the proper tests to rule this in or out.Please keep us posted with your results:)",

    "question": "I had ablation for svt. Diagnosed with high BP, diabetes, anxiety, etc. I have these 'spells' off and on experiencing increased BP (195/120 last 'episode'), rapid heart rate, profuse sweating, stomach pain, nausau, extreme flush feeling of my entire body, extreme panic, and have fainted with a few of these episodes. Also afterwards---I am extremely cold to the point of shivering.\u00a0\u00a0I have experienced these 'spells' for a few years now. I have had cardiologist work up x2 with nothing significant. Int. Med. Dr. just says panic attacks. I dont have panic attacks until I experience these 'spells'. It has been very difficult to get anyone to understand. Your opinion is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",
