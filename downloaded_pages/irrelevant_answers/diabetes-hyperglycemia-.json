            "answer": "Well consider a work up by a doctor that specialize in \"functional medicine\".\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They are going to look at everything.\u00a0\u00a0You can google one in your area.\u00a0\u00a0 Your problem could be anything e.g. thyroid condition, low vitamin D3, etc. etc. etc.\u00a0\u00a0 A good doctor can really evaluate all these things.I say D3, because a friend of mind kept fainting.\u00a0\u00a0They did all kinds of tests and couldn't find anything.\u00a0\u00a0She finally went to a functional medicine doctor who was saw she was low on D3.\u00a0\u00a0She started supplementing and her fainting spells went away.\u00a0\u00a0It was miraculous.Also, you may not be able to do a traditional glucose tolerance test, but you might be able to do a carbohydrate challenge test.\u00a0\u00a0 A carb challenge test can give a doctor a lot of information and at the same time not be so hard on your body.If you get one insist on a 4hr test.\u00a0\u00a0Also insist that they measure your insulin levels at 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 4 also.Also, try to calibrate your glucometer with serum test.\u00a0\u00a0Your glucometer could be off.\u00a0\u00a0 Some of them can be off by as much as 30+%.Be well.",

            "answer": "I agree with what super Sally wrote.\u00a0\u00a0Best option is to eat a low carb, moderate protein with balance of calories from fats, like olive oil, nuts, grass fed butter, etc.\u00a0\u00a0not sure beans and lentils are good for you, as this causes increase in sugar in blood from high carb content.\u00a0\u00a0Also don't be afraid to eat fats.\u00a0\u00a0People who eat low carb with ultra high protein and low fat run into the gluconeogenesis problem, which is your body taking some of the ultra high protein intake and making sugar (glucose).\u00a0\u00a0This is why some people get high blood sugar and heart racing after drinking a large protein shake (with low carb and no fat).\u00a0\u00a0Eat fat with your proteins, like full fat yogurt.\u00a0\u00a0Eat three meals per day, no snacking in between, and typical meal looking like this:\u00a0\u00a0green or low-sugar vegetable with meat/flush/eggs and healthy fats (olive oil, coconut oil, grass fed butter, avocado, nuts, etc).\u00a0\u00a0Stay away from carb rich stuff like beans, rice, pasta, bread, flour, etc.\u00a0\u00a0stay away from sugar. Eat fruit as a rare treat, opt for vegetables instead.",
