Doctor even said once or twice he may be a big baby. But a baby at that size is normal. I'm 37 weeks now and have gained 1 pound so everyone is telling me that the baby will be almost 10 pounds. My sister-in-law has had 3 kids.. Her first one was 5.5.. second one was 6.2 and 3rd was 6.3.... I have an older brother who was 8 pounds.. I was 5.5. I'm also 5'2'' so I feel the pain! Lol",
