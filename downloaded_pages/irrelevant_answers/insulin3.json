            "answer": "Fasting before a test means no food or color liquids for 8-12 hours. Normal fasting blood sugar levels are 60/70 to 99 mg/dl. Prediabetes is 100 to 125 mg/dl. Usually a test result of 109 mg/dl indicates prediabetes. You can verify this by getting an A1c test, which is what doctors use to verify a fasting and/or OGTT test result. Home A1c meters are available OTC or you can ask your doctor for an A1c test. To see if you are at risk of being a t2 diabetic you can take the free online American Diabetes Association [ADA] Diabetes Risk Testhttp://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/prevention/diabetes-risk-test/?loc=DropDownDB-RiskTest",

            "answer": "thanx for your quick reply. I did have black coffee right before the test. I have hypothyroidism. It was a new Endo I saw last June that ordered the blood work. He did not inform me of the insulin of 109 until August. And he told me I was \"becoming insulin resistant\". My glucose was normal. I'm confused. Are insulin and blood sugar the same thing?",

            "answer": "The black coffee 8-12 hours prior to a blood sugar test will skewer test results. That was a no-no. If your Endo was not told about the \"black coffee\" he/she is going by your test result and why you were informed of \"becoming insulin resistant\". As I said earlier, you may or may not be prediabetic. A follow up test is necessary.Before venturing on let's clarify some terms. Blood sugar and glucose in a round about way are synonymous. Blood sugar is used more often than glucose for the simple reason this is what is heard or read most often when diabetes is mentioned.Insulin is produced by your pancreas to allow glucose from your blood to be absorbed by cells in your liver, muscles and fat to be used for your bodies energy needs. It does more but I won't get into that.A thyroid disorder will affect your blood sugar levels too. So it is important to pay careful attention to carbohydrate intake. All carbs raise blood sugar levels but you need carbs for energy. Concentrate on eating complex carbs; whole grains, more vegies, fish and poultry. Lean meats are OK. Avoid simple carbs as the sugars from them quickly enter your bloodstream. Avoid foods made with white flour - breads, crackers, pasta, etc. Also, avoid eating starchy foods such as potatoes and white rice. These along with daily exercise and maintaining normal body weight helps to control blood sugar levels. HTH",

            "answer": "I found out yesterday that I actually had low glucose in June. The Dr. I saw didn't explain this to me. I was confused by the numbers the Dr. gave me, told me, and couldn't find anything about having an insulin level of 109, as he stated. I called his office to ask for both numbers yesterday. She checked my file and said my glucose was low!!!! So now I'm just waiting for my PCP to have a look at my labs and tell me what's going on. Thanx again for your help",
