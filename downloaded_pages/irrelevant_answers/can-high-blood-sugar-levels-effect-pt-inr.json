Now I found another lab. You have to know the range of PT, INR AND PTT., then you see is the numbers match. Sometimes labs use not expensive reactive and this is a problem.Since 1989 I have a notebook with all my labs, results, food etc....well you can contact me ***@****",

    "question": "About 1 year ago I was told I have Pre-Diabetes. Since then I have been on a wieght loss program and have been losing and have not had my blood sugar levels check since that intial diagnosis. With in the last few months my PT-INR levels have been WAY out of control and we are unable to get it under control. I have also been noticing that I am having more symptoms of Type II Diabetes. I have not starting doing anything until now becuase I was thinking that weight loss, high fluid intake and output, tingling of the feet, and fatigue were just from my attempt to get healthy. Can high blood sugar levels effect a PR-INR. For reference my IRN has been ranging from 4.3 and above and 1.8 or lower. I have been adjusting my Coumadin and having my INR check every 10 days for 3 months now and now one can undersand way I can not get a stable INR. This is why I am asking my question.",
