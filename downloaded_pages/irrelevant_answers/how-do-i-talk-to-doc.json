But when he went there to check on me my blood pressure went done and he basically yelled at me saying I was stupid and there wasn't a thing wrong with me... I got a new Dr real quick. Best of luck",

Watch \"The Business of Being Born.\" If I'd seen it before my first child,\u00a0\u00a0I would definitely have stood up for myself more. C-sections are easier,quicker, and more profitable for doctors. Don't be bullied into something you don't want!",

My husband does not want me to have a male Dr.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for the advice on the video. I just want my voice to be heard and decision respected unless of course me and the baby are seriously in danger",

She may have a concern about the baby's size or your health, but you won't know until you ask. If she is rude, then I would tell your husband that your comfort before, during, and after birth trumps his lack of desire for you to have a male ob. I have had a male ob for 3 of mine and not once have they made me feel uncomfortable.",

            "answer": "I initially had a female ob that did not like to be questioned. It is our first child so of course we had questions. My husband and I sat down with her & politely explained our concerns. She basically said we could find another doctor if we weren't pleased. We took her up on her offer & now have a wonderful male doc. I knew if she was rude before the baby then she definitely wouldn't have bedside manners during my delivery. So I say sit down & talk to her & her response will let you know what the next step should be.",

            "answer": "Thanks everyone. I was referred to a specialist by my ob because she said I'm high risk. I met with the specialist yesterday who told me that obesity puts me in the high risk category but I'm not really high risk. The ultra sound showed everything is great with my little girl. The tests all came back great except for iron ...I'm anemic. No diabetes no high bp. Some swelling in my legs but not abnormal. My heart has a pregnancy related murmur but not a worry. I asked the specialist about all my concerns. I was reassured that unless something dramatic changed I could have a natural birth. I feel relieved and followup again with my OB in 3 weeks. Have to retest for diabetes and get my rh- injection. Should be okay we hope.",

My water broke on it's own, but after 25 hours I was still only dilated to a 6 and had a fever for several hours, so due to possible infection I had a C-section (my son also wasn't being very active which concerned them). My bill before insurance was just over $11,000 and my son's was $5,000. I suggest asking your OB if she thinks you can have a natural birth, if she says no or seems hesitant I say find someone else.\u00a0\u00a0Your husband will understand. My doctor wanted to avoid a C-section, but my body wasn't cooperating and the risk of infection and harm to my little man was getting higher.",

    "question": "My Dr makes me feel as if something is wrong with me and my baby every time I see her. I really want a natural birth but I think my Dr might prefer a c section. The way I have been made to feel constantly being told I'm overweight and unhealthy makes me nervous to even discuss with my Dr. I feel like she has her mind made up on how high risk I am. Or maybe I'm not fully understanding her concerns. Any advice?",
