            "answer": "Hi,It is important to know if your thyroid levels are normal or not after treatment. Thyroid dysfunction can cause tingling numbness in the body so it is important to make sure if thyroid levels are in the normal range.Other possibility is peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes and B 12 deficiency. I would suggest you to discuss with your doctor and let us know if you need more information.Thanks",

    "question": "I have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and a vitamin d defiency. I am taking medicine for hypothyroidism and a prescription for the d defiency. I started having tingling in the bottoms of my feet that has spread to my legs, arms and hands. I also have tingling in the back of my neck and slightly in my head. I have had tingling lips and the tip of my tongue. I have muscle twitches all over my body and weakness in my arms and legs. The weakness is more pronounced in my left leg and arm. Occasionally my knees feel tight. At night, I have had strange feelings in both upper arms. Almost like the blood doesn't flow right and I feel like I need to move them. I have had times when my face twitches and it looks strange. Most bothersome is my throat feels funny. I can't tell if my throat is twitching or tingling, it just feels terrible. My doctors says these symptoms are not related to my thyroid condition or the vitamin d defiency. She thinks it's do to stress. I'm not stressed out. These things are happening, because something is just not right. Any ideas would be appreciated. I have had a CT scan and a CBC they were normal.",
