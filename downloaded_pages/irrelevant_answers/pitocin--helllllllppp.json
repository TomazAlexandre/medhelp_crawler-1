Today my doctor brought up me getting induced on Monday as well.\u00a0\u00a0I'm currently 39w4d and I told them I'll wait till I'm 40 weeks then we'll talk induction. I rather wait to see if I have a chance going into labor on my own. I would say try walking , squats, stairs , etc to get things going. I felt a little cheated having to be induced with my first but that's just me. Hopefully I can go into labor myself since I'm 2cm 50% thinned. Good luck momma!",

            "answer": "Due date is Friday. Last week I went in yo be induced (39 weeks like you mentioned) because I have gestational diabetes and had to start a medication for bellspalsy and they didn't want them to throw off the diabetes. I wasn't dialated and cervix was not even close to being ready, it was closed. I hate pain and needles but the iv was not bad. No pain nothing hurt. But I was in the hospital from Wednesday afternoon til Friday morning. Pit did nothing for me:/ I was released. Got on an exercise ball, excercise bike, hot bath. And squats and now I'm finally at a one with my cervix. Just be as active til then. Good luck and you'll do fine:)",

            "answer": "I was induced (in the hospital) with pitocin at 39 weeks because of a medical concern and I was in labor for 30 hours. Stuck at 4cm for 20 of those hours. My contractions started almost immediately and happened like every 2 minutes, after 20 hours I couldn't take it anymore and got the epidural. I am a FTM too so I don't know if they were worse because of the pitocin because I have nothing to\u00a0\u00a0compare it to but I have heard that they are.I would strongly recommend not taking the pitocin at home (don't know how they can do that since it's an IV drug) and I would wait until you are overdue before getting induced unless it's medically necessary. It sounds like your doctor wants to induce you because HE's impatient not for your or baby's health.",

    "question": "Ok so my doc wants to give me pitocin on Monday BC I'm 39 weeks and my baby has not dropped, my cervix has not changed and I have not dialated. He's said it doesn't look like she's coming any time soon so he wanted to send me home with medicine Like pitocin to bring on labor. Has anyone ever had to do this to bring on labor??? If so is it more painful or is there anything I should be worried about? FTM",
