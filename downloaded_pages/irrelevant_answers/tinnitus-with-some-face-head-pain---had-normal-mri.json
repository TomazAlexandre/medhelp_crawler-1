            "answer": "The symptoms you describe sound very similiar to temporal lobe seizures. You can have several of these per day and not even know what happened, they last a mere 5 - 30 seconds and generally not life threatening,however you need to be evaluated by a neurologist. A standard EEG(brain wave testing)may not initially pick up this type of seizure activity, it may require a 2-3 day study or even perhaps an overnite study.Do you have diabetes or an underlying thyroid problem that you are aware of? Certain types of these conditions can cause seizures. Have you had any recent lab work done?",

            "answer": "Interesting.\u00a0\u00a0I had not thought of those. It seems that this happens (mainly) when I have to interact with people this confusion state occurs.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think it's the actual interaction, but I believe it's when I have to think intensely and interact -- using facial expressions, etc.\u00a0\u00a0It's about impossible to describe.\u00a0\u00a0So, I can almost know when it is going to happen again (really anytime I have to interact...)",
