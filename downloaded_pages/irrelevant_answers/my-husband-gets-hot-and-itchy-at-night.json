    "question": "My husband, for quite some time, has been having issues staying asleep for an extended period of time at night because when he does get to sleep he gets physically hot and his legs get really really itchy.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't matter where he sleeps (in the house or if he's away on a business trip), what time he falls asleep, or how much sleep he's had the night before. It will wake him up out of a dead sleep, and when the itchiness is bad he's been known to itch his legs bloody. There are no bumps, bites, bruising or anything. It's been a long drawn out problem for him, and I don't really understand it myself.\u00a0\u00a0He's been known to have restless leg syndrome at night after extended bouts of exercise, but I don't really know if that could in any way be related (especially considering the feeling hot part).\u00a0\u00a0Could it be a blood pressure thing?\u00a0\u00a0Neurological?\u00a0\u00a0I don't know, but would love to find something that might help him find relief so he can get a good night sleep.Thanks for any insight you could provide.",
