            "answer": "Have you tried Government Health plans?\u00a0\u00a0They accept pre-existing, at a price, but when you think about the cost of medical care, versus, the cost of insurance, it still comes out as a good deal, after the 6month waiting period.Once he has been on a plan for a year, then he can change to a different health plan, but he will pay the high prices for it also.Has been gainfully employed for 10 years, prior to becoming ill?\u00a0\u00a0If so, then he has the option of signing up for Social Security Disability, which comes with Medicare, but again, he will pay premiums, and will need a supplemental insurance to pick up the balance, but he'll be looking at a lot lower premiums.I don't now whether CHF will qualify him for SSD, but it sure wouldn't hurt to check it out, and while he's at, check with Adult and Family services to see if the have a health plan for people in his situation.Hope this helps......",
