            "answer": "I am so surprised, I have an appt with the neuro surgeon tomorrow morning. I have been having a lot of trouble with my eyes, but didn't relate that to the cervical problems. They get very blurry, and have trouble focusing. I even got new glasses, and still have to constantly adjust them to try to get clear sight. This can be from the herniated disc? I just figured it was a different issue. I will check out the different type of glucosamine. Willing to try anything that might help. Thank you so much for your quick response. If you can think of anything else I need to ask tomorrow morning, please let me know, definitely will ask about the X-stop. The neuro-surgeon I am seeing is supposed to be one of the best in\u00a0\u00a0the Pacific Northwest....I live in a little town in Eastern Oregon, so have to travel for good medical care. Again, thank you and bless you.",

    "question": "I posted this once, but couldn't see it appear anywhere. I have tried glucosamine for 6mos, with no signs of improvement. The neuor doc recommened watching the lumbar and thoracic regions, but commented that the cervical area was more difficult. I think I confused meyolopathy for radiculopathy. I have radiating pain in left arm, and both shoulders. I show a great deal of \"waterfall\" osteophytes in the thoracic region, with end plate changes in the thoracic spine.what are those? Hope to get my neurosurgeon appointment sometime this week.I would like to handle this conservativly, but am worried about my neck, as I can't tip it to left side more than 10%, cannot touch my chin to chest, and feel a great deal of pressure and pain, with the almost constasnt headaches. Thank you for your input.",
