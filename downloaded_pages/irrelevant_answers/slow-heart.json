It runs in the family.If you are not having problems with dizzy spells then it is probably normal for you. If you are having problems then you should check with your doctor. But from the sounds of your post, you are just a healthy, fit teenager. Go enjoy yourself!",

My family doesn't really have the money to go to a doctor, which is why i'm trying to find a way to help get better without spending money. A low heart rate doesn't run in my family, my dad my brother and I are the only people that have been active in my entire family and they both have high heart rates.",

            "answer": "Now that's a very different story. My low heart rate never caused me problems. At your age you shouldn't be passing out or getting dizzy unless you are extremely dehydrated or overexerted. You should have someone look at you but I really don't have any suggestions. Maybe someone else on this forum will be able to give you some guidance.Could you maybe start with your school nurse or doctor? Does you coach have any suggestions?\u00a0\u00a0Sorry I can't be of help but maybe some else will post some suggestions.",

Not that they would diagnose or treat you!I agree with OxygenRunningOut, you need to be evaluated by a professional to diagnose what is wrong with you. You can help your parents save money in other areas, but not when it comes to your health.",

I know that in athletes it can be in the low 40's and have that be normal but not the passing out.everyone is different. no one in my family was born with heart problems either but y 4th son was. disease can just start for no known reason. there are also plans out there if you have testing done in the hospital where they might \"excuse\" your bill since you can't afford them.it might be something like a vagal response. but in my opinion you should get it checked out before something serious could happen, not saying it is but athletes, especially football players are for some reason having more cardiac issues.good luck and please try to get to a doctor soonmichelle",
