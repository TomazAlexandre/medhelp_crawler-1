Also, what pain mgt methods did you use that caused the pain to disappear?I would appreciate your help with this. Thank you.",

            "answer": "Thanks Kim, will take your advice and walk more. Bonnie Anne, I stopped my Oxycontin program a few months back. I w s prescribed the drug and was addicted within a week. Decided after about thirty days that I had had enough and just walked away from it. Took two months before I was completely free of withdrawal. As for the back, I just didn't do anything that exerted pressure on my legs or back.. I walked on my toes so as not to put pressure on my back because walking on your heels exerts a lot of pressure. I didn't pick up anything over twenty pounds, rested as much as possible and let nature take it's course. As long as there is no pressure on your back from walking heavy, lifting, bending too quickly or any thing else that puts a strain on your back you should gradually be okay.",

    "question": "I am finally without any back pain at all. Last night and today I have felt no pain at all. Even my restless leg syndrome has lessened to a point where it is almost non existent. I also have chronic asthma that causes lung infections about every two or three months. I have been infection free and attack free now for almost five months and at my age that is incredible. I will be going for a blood sugar test next month, According to my doctor I have border line diabetes. This I don't understand. You are either diabetic or not,there is no in between. Prior to my last test, the day before to be exact, and before I wnent on the twelve hour fast before the test,\u00a0\u00a0I had eaten about a half pound of halvah. This is an extremely sweet candy. It looks like asbestos and is perfect for anyone with an extremely sweet tooth. This may have raised my sugar level even though I had not eaten for twelve hours before the test. As for the rest of me I have arthritis of the neck back and right knee. I have glaucoma , loss of hearing and a very tiny prostate cancer. If it wasn't for these problems I would be in perfect shape which means that I am in perfect shape for the shape I'm in.",
