            "answer": "Hi,Atypical urothelial cells in the urinary sediment are a common finding. They may occur in a variety of benign conditions, but also in low-grade tumors. Computerized image analysis of atypical urothelial cells has shown that they could be separated into 2 groups. One of these shares cell features with benign cells and the other with malignant cells.Cancer from another area cannot be the cause for its presence in the urine.How-ever this does not mean you have cancer of the urinary tract .Coupled with the fact that you have experienced weight loss and frequent urination it may be significant.Have you got your blood sugar testet?These same symptoms can be seen in diabetes too.ref:http://www.aqch.com/toc/auto_abstract.php?id=22951",

    "question": "I am a 57 year old female with migratory joint and muscle pain. It ranges from mild to debilitating. I have had this for several years.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor says I have rheumatoid arthritis even though the blood tests do not show the antibodies. His diagnosis is based on the finger and hand deformities in one hand and the painful joints and swelling of joints. I also have experienced weight loss, from 150 to 120 pounds in 6 months. I also have very frequent urination, which I have experienced for several years.\u00a0\u00a0Blood was found in a recent urine sample, another sample showed atypical urothelial cells. Cystoscopy was normal.\u00a0\u00a0Abdominal ultra sound was normal but air in intestine blocked the technician from seeing more. Pelvic ultra sound scheduled.\u00a0\u00a0Could cancer in another area of my body cause atypical urothelial cells in my urine? Would this be indicative of a more advanced form of cancer? Can I have atypical urothelial cells in my urine and not have cancer?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, am concerned.",
