            "answer": "I'm a bit perplexed that you are expressing that much concern and describing your symptoms in detail and expected people on a website to diagnose you! We are not doctors. No, it doesn't sound like anything characteristic of diabetes but it DOES sound like something to have a doctor check out. Please go and see your doctor and have him assess what is going on with your foot.",
