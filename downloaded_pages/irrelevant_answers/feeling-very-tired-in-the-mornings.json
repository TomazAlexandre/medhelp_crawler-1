            "answer": "There are no doctors on this board, male, only other people with diabetesThere are a couple things you don't mention. Do you test your blood sugar? And if so, what sorts of readings are you seeing first thing? You say you feel better after breakfast. How long do you wait to eat? If your blood sugar is low when you get up, you should be eating pretty soon. Also, when did you last see your doctor or get an A1C?You mention drinking. Alcohol lowers blood sugar, sometimes dramatically. If you are drinking even a moderate amount at night, your blood sugar might, in fact, be dipping too low overnight. Do some testing to see what's going on and try making some changes in food and alcohol and if there is no improvement, you might want to see your doctor.",

If you are diabetic, that is the first thing you should check, then look for other possibilities for how you feel. (It isn't ALWAYS diabetes!)140 is too high for a fasting sugar, btw.",

            "answer": "When was your last doctor's visit? If you've been a diabetic for nine years and now have a fasting glucose of 140 mg/dl indicates you've been ignoring your diabetes and haven't paid attention to your doctor's instructions.Testing your glucose levels whenever, in your case last month, and doing \"strenuous exercises at the gym\" because you have 'abundant energy\" only makes matters worse.Bottom line stop posting on forums and make an appointment to see your doctor today for you may have other issues going on; thyroid, pancreas, liver and/or kidney.",
