            "answer": "What you are describing sounds like dysesthesias.\u00a0\u00a0I have similar sensations in my left hand.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to the burning sensation, it always feels like my skin is wrapped too tight around my hand.\u00a0\u00a0My skin is super sensitive on my hand and lower arm, and sometimes a light touch or the rubbing of my sleeve on my arm makes me feel almost nauseated.For this symptom I take the max daily dose (3600mg)\u00a0\u00a0of gabapentin (anti-convulsant) plus 50mg of amitriptyline (tricyclic antidepressant) at night.\u00a0\u00a0It helps to make this pain more bearable, but it never completely goes away.Occasionally I wrap my hand and arm in an ace bandage.\u00a0\u00a0The snugness of it seems to diminish the super sensitivity of the skin.I haven't noticed that this symptom worsens with stress, but it definitely worsens with fatigue, rise in body temp, and overuse of my hand.Apparently this is one of the more difficult MS symptoms to treat.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you are able to get some relief.\u00a0\u00a0 Have you discussed this problem with your GP or neurologist?",

            "answer": "Burning skin was my first symptom. For the longest time I kept looking at the skin on my thighs and it was perfectly normal, not all red and inflamed. I actually used to put a bag of frozen vegetables on the bad places.I still have problems with this, mostly on my right shin, as if a big swooshing paint brush had caused the burning.Since this is a paresthesia, taking ordinary pain meds such as Tylenol has no effect. I have been greatly helped by doses of Lyrica twice a day, and a small dose of amitriptyline at bedtime.For some reason, mentioning burning on legs makes my neuro repeatedly suspect diabetes, even though I am clearly not diabetic, having been tested over and over. Others here have commented that their neuros do the same thing, so it might be best to find a word other than burning when you discuss this. Maybe 'badly chafing'?ess",

            "answer": "Its called cutaneous allodynia,\u00a0\u00a0which basically translates to other skin pain.Interesting your neuro checks for diabetes because my skin pain gets much worse when I eat lots of sugar.I agree with something like gabapentin helping. Right now I am taking Zonegran which is the best so far for me, it has really knocked the pain out, and stabilized my moods.Acupuncture has also done wonders for me in helping with this skin pain and provides almost immediate relief after the treatment.",

    "question": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have very many symptoms thank god..but every once in a while (especially when I am stressed), I gt skin pain.\u00a0\u00a0a part of my skin (usually on my thighs, hands or sometimes on my stomach), feels like it's been burned.\u00a0\u00a0I have it now on my left hand (my two middle fingers mostly) and I keep looking at it to find a burn! It's painful inside my skin and extreemly sensetive to touch and cold or hot water.\u00a0\u00a0If you have ever been burned with hot steam, you would know the horrible sensation.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone else gets that?\u00a0\u00a0And if yes, is there anyway of treating it?Thank you.",
