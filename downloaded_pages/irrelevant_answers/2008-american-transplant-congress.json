            "answer": "Hey Kande!Well, this might not be put in your \"best information\" category. This is sorta like handing you the playbill of the show, but not letting you in to see the play. I posted it just that you can see some of the things that the doctors are looking into at this point - new drugs coming etc, but unfortunately nothing we can read. But at least in knowing what they are talking about at these meetings, patients can ask their doctors what the findings were. Someone had posted on the medical forum a drug that was used for hep along with SOC. By posting that, I was able to email my doc and ask him if it was any good and if I should add it to my tx (I am adding everything at this point but Lysol and dish detergent:) and so anyway he said no, the drug did not work,,,,but at least I knew or heard about it and was able to ask.MO",

    "question": "I thought this might be of interest for a few reasons..Its always encouraging to see how hard doctors are working at trying to help with this disease - though 'at times' we can feel as if we slip through the cracks. And also, reading the different doctors names and where they are from, I would think that you could then google their names and find studies that they have been involved in and be able to learn more and or possibly find a doctor for a second opinion etc if you notice any that are from hospitals in your area - that's if they take on patients.I found that just reading the topics that they will be covering interesting - though we don't have the info to read (not that I would comprehend it all anyway), just found it interesting what they will be discussing. For instance the topic, \"Should Immunosuppression Be Changed in Patients with New Onset Diabetes Mellitus?\"See you guys later,MOhttp://www.atcmeeting.org/2008/index2.cfm?section=program&content=premeeting_symposia",
