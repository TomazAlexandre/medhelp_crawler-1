            "answer": "Unless your doctor says otherwise. The recommended weight gain is different for everyone. I am 5'3\" and weighed 278 before I got pregnant. With a mixture of severe morning sickness, sleeping most of the time and walking when I could I lost 34 pounds my first 15 weeks. I am now 31 weeks and only gained 5 pounds since I was 15 weeks. However my doctor does not want me gaining too much more weight. Your doctor will let you know if s/he is concerned about your weight.",

Yea she gained a little to much bit she was still healthy n so was the baby. I think as long as u dnt have high blood pressure or diabetes n ur baby is healthy u should be fine.",
