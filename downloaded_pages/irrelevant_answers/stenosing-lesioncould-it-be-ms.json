            "answer": "No worries :) thank you for the response and the welcome!I am rethinking the doctor situation already. Its bad enough when they think your crazy or they tell you something is what its not and the meds make you worse. I wish the one who helped the most hadn't retired as soon as I found him it seemed. I plan on calling him and cornering him tomorrow and call and see if I can be put on a cancelation list for sooner to the neurologist as well. In the meantime I am arming myself with questions and hoping my new neurologist wont just see a fat 41 year old and scream diabetes LOL. If he does he better watch out ;)",

            "answer": "I mean corner my currant regular physician O.O looked like I was going to go to old one in retirement. I wish. I guess I will just ask to please have a better understanding of what was found even if he wont give me a complete explanation. I am not sure what a stenosing lesion is except stenosing meaning restricting....and lesion being an abnormal growth. They couls have told me where the growth it. I can only speculate, and that honestly isn't my job....hugs lisa and thank you again!Sincerely, Beth AKA ladygraley",

    "question": "I have been having problems for a loooong time since I was 12. Pain, muscle aches cramping muscles and general horribly feeling and fatigued. I thought I was just nuts. It turned into breathing problems with chronic bronchitis that even 5 rounds of antibiotics wouldn't fix like 2x per year.But things changed this April....my pinky went numb...then the ring finger...by the time I switched dr's and got an apt for a neurologist I was scared to death and my toes and left foot did the same. The first neuro did tests...the nerve conduction and etc. on my arm only. But he promptly sent me packing back to the reg md with \"ulnar nerve palsy\" as a diagnosis....as he said \"its probably diabetes he says. (sigh)In the meantime the dr who finally listened and got me a referral to the Neurologist and a dermatologist retires. Sorry I forgot to mention during the April incident my dry skin on my top of my nose that I have had for years spread to my eyebrow hairline and ears. I also got told I wasn't having an infection that I had leukocytosis. Dermatologist confirmed retired dr's answer of psoriasis on elbows and ankles and sebhorreic dermatitis on my face.So in August I returned to the new dr....he sent me for blood tests and said we would worry about other things later. No diabetes and no thyroid problems. I do have a goiter...no clue where it came from but\u00a0\u00a0reared its ugly head in April as well.\u00a0\u00a0So next I get a call to get xrays, no arthritis no bone spurs. Next a appt. for ct scan. The CT results send a nurse calling me telling me they are normal....and I get told \" make an appt. if symptoms persist\" WTF.Made an appt. go see him get a resounding \"Why didn't you get an MRI?\". At this point I am mad, in pain when I try to sleep cause my muscles are starting to hurt and joint in affected nerve areas. I had a double apt. that day with my 15 yo daughter. Shes had the same probs, but even worse than me when I was younger, for 3 years now. So much so shes got an appt. with a rheumatologist in Nov. So as my appointment ends...he says \"take these anxiety meds (I was freaked out in his office) and this nerontin for pain. We'll call with MRI appointment. Also we havn't ruled out MS.(said with a sense of dread in his voice). He then turns to my daughter and says \"It won't be good news for you if it is MS but it would explain your problems too\" How does one take this? srsly....So on Friday the 6th of September I had a MRI of my neck and cervical. I get a call from the dr's receptionist.....this is all she says \"stenosing lesion, non cancerous. See the new neuro and a neurosurgeon.\" I try to ask questions but get told to look it up online. HELP PLEASE....I went from thinking I am crazy to feeling like I have half an answer :(",
