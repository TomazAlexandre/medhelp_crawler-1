            "answer": "I had a brother-in-law (no longer married into our family so I won't be able to get more info) who had what you describe. He told us that there is an enzyme that metabolizes alcohol and in some people it does not work properly, thus they get drunk quickly on even small amounts of alcohol. I can't recall, but it would make sense it's a liver enzyme. He went on to tell us that some people do not have this enzyme. He said this was a genetic factor in some races and nationalities who have reputations for lots of alcholics among their ranks. I have no clue if this is correct. I am only passing on something I once heard. As JB said, complete abstinence would be the answer even if you don't figure out what the problem is. Best wishes.",

            "answer": "An entire thread about alcohol and withdrawal disappeared over night. what? Couldn't the ole Doctor allow people to see that even in big hospitals they can misdiagnose something as severeas the Delirium Tremens and almost kill a patient because of the lack of knowledge of some of the lesser trained staff? Is he afraid to scare too many alcoholics into not wanting to quit.Well the guy in the DT's who was being tied down finally did get the meds he needs after I",

            "answer": "Have you ever been checked for Diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Could you be having insulin reactions? My sister is /WAS a diabetic (AFTER 34 YEARS OF BEING A DIABETIC SHE JUST GOT A KIDNEY/PANCREAS TRANSPLANT 4 MONTHS AGO.\u00a0\u00a0THEY TOLD MY SISTER THAT THE WAIT WOULD BE 3 YEARS OR MORE IF AT ALL BECAUSE OF NEEDING TWO ORGANS.\u00a0\u00a0TWO WEEKS YES I SAID TWO WEEKS LATER HER BEEPER WENT OFF AND THE REST IS HISTORY.\u00a0\u00a0CAN YOU BELIEVE SHE ONLY WAITED TWO WEEKS. GOT ME BACK INTO CHURCH TOO.) when her blood sugar would get so high she would seem drunk and then black out.\u00a0\u00a0This is when she was 5 and up. She had not been drinking.\u00a0\u00a0I will say too that some years back my sister was FALSELY arrested for DUI.\u00a0\u00a0She tried to tell them she was a diabetic and that her insulin was in the car.\u00a0\u00a0They would not let her get it and show the cops.\u00a0\u00a0They kept her in jail all night long because they said that she was drunk and acting incoherant. She then became more out of it because her blood sugar was totally out of control they actually shackeled her to her bed.\u00a0\u00a0Well one big lawsuit later that my sister won.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone in the courtroom learned how a diabetic can produce the same similarities that someone that is drunk may display.There I go being so long winded. Anyway, get your blood tested.\u00a0\u00a0This sound just like symptoms of diabetes. You mentioned one of your drinks were EGGNOG that drink is VERY high in sugar and carbs.\u00a0\u00a0That would have sent my sister flying if she would have had that in her diabetic days. Please get yourself check ASAP and Please keep us posted too.Marcie!",

            "answer": "nagged the nurses to call his doctor to giver him Ativan for the DT's. They did not know what was wrong with him at the time. His brother became so scared while watching the seizures and DT's that he thanked me, admitted his own alcoholism and left for the states for in-patient detox.So maybe some alcoholics need to know they should be scared when it comes to withdrawal especially when DUI can leave a person in jail long enough to trigger seizures and DT's.",

            "answer": "Alcohol is a posion.If you get ill when you drink alcohol, then don't drink it !\u00a0\u00a0Simple as that.Your family doctor or medical specialist will not tell you to stop drinking alcohol because most MD'S and medical professionals are alcohol drinkers.The vast majority of MD's are highly functional alcoholics. And as such beleive most MDs secretly beleive it is\u00a0\u00a0socially necessary to drink alcohol, to be socially functional. Medical Doctors will not tell you to quit because they need your income as a patient.\u00a0\u00a0Will a real estate agent tell you not to purchase a home?\u00a0\u00a0Will an investment banker advise you not to purchase stock?\u00a0\u00a0So again, will a medical doctor tell you to stop drinking and loose a paying customer?If alcohol makes you sick....stop drinking alcohol, and just learn to deal with the social ramifications because most of this country drinks.\u00a0\u00a0So,\u00a0\u00a0make your choice and live with it ok?\u00a0\u00a0Oh and by the way...taking pain killers for migraines and mixing them with alcohol is suicidal and YOU KNOW THAT !\u00a0\u00a0All the warning labels on pain meds say DON'T DRINK.\u00a0\u00a0So why did you drink on pain meds??\u00a0\u00a0You have a serious drinking problem.\u00a0\u00a0Time to deal with it.\u00a0\u00a0It's rude, but thats reality my friend.From,A recovered alcoholic, 10 years clean.",

    "question": "Over the last 2 years I have developed a condition where on rare occasions I have all the effects of excessive drinking after only 1 or 2 drinks.\u00a0\u00a0I drink socially but not excessively (2-4 drinks over 3-4 hours maybe once a week) and usually have no major effects.\u00a0\u00a0On these occasions I speak of (maybe 4 times in 2 years), all alcohol effects\u00a0\u00a0seem exaggerated.\u00a0\u00a0This happened last night while Christmas Caroling with some friends.\u00a0\u00a0I had 3 small glasses of egg nog, we sang for about 30 minutes, I remember getting our photos taken before we went back inside but nothing after that.\u00a0\u00a0My wife said I was acting really drunk, she got me home and into bed and I don't recall any of this.\u00a0\u00a0On other occasions a single drink has affected my like 6-8.\u00a0\u00a0We are trying to find a common denominator but haven't yet.\u00a0\u00a0It's happened with wine, mixed drinks, and now egg nog so it doesn't appear to be one kind of alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing my wife has noted on all occasions is a strong, almost kerosene smell on my breath.\u00a0\u00a0This last time I had taken some Migraine medicine about 7 hours prior.\u00a0\u00a0It made us wonder if this might be a trigger.\u00a0\u00a0It's the only prescription drug I take.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure how long these drugs stay in the system but I'm sure on previous occasions I didn't have a Migraine the same day but many a day or two prior is possible. I've checked your site but short of one entry on Zyban & alcohol reactions (which sounds similar) I didn't see anything.\u00a0\u00a0Please advise and also if I were to go to a Dr. to get this checked further what kind of Dr. should I go to?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for the help...",
