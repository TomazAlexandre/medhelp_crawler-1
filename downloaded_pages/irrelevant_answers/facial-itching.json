Also use an antibacterial soap or mild soap like dove.Avoid any kind of cosmetics.Also exfoliate the skin at regular intervals with a mild exfoliant. Topical antibiotics such as mupirocin or neomycin containing ointment are also useful in folliculitis.In case the symptoms persist then oral antibiotics may be needed.Pls consult a dermatologist in that case.I hope that helps.Kind regards.",
