            "answer": "I can't tell from your post if you are someone trying to see if they have diabetes, or a diagnosed diabetic wondering where they should be at post prandial. If you are the former, then it would be abnormal to rise above 120 for a non-diabetic. Also for a diagnosed diabetic, many doctors still use the ADA figure of 180 but studies have shown that complications begin at sustained numbers above 140 so that might be a safer goal imho.",

These are basic USA standards and may or may not be practiced by your doctor in Australia. Call or visit or your doctor and ask for his/her reference range.",

For example:-Optimal is about 4.7 (in non diabetics).The cut off for diabeties is usually about 6.0.Obviously there is a very big difference between 4.7 and 6.0.",
