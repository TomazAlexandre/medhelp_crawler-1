            "answer": "Thanks kenkeith! Very helpful information.How long is Cholesterol results measured for? I was told long term, how long is that?For 5 months have been dieting and exercising for up to an hour each day 5 days a week. Before that I would exercise around a hour 2 to 3 days a week. For a couple of years, my diet has been bad in the weekend when I go to my boyfriends house. At my house I have healthy meals. I was wondering if my diet before 5 months ago was why I have mild high cholesterol.",

    "question": "I'm 24, I went for a runtine cholesterol blood test. The doctor said he would test for iron and I think folate levels. When I got my results he said that my iron levels and others (he mentioned kidney) were great. Does anyone know the list of things he would of tested for? Would he be testing for thyroid as well, and all other Vitimins?Also, I have mild high cholesterol, (on a diet now to get down.) I get PAC's, I've heard that they are benign in a structrually normal heart (I've had an echocardiogram, and the results came back normal,) do they have anything to do with cholestrol?",
