            "answer": "I just read your thread under candie1982's post that was duplicated here.\"What are his doctors missing?\"I don't know since you failed to mention the types of doctor's seen by your father. Has your father pointed out the \"small bulge\" to the doctor and/or doctors? Was it just a primary care physician who saw you father? Was he referred to a specialist? It would be nice to know what they had to say about this too. Therefore, without knowing what they did or said, I would concur with peek's statement about seeing a gastro to diagnose your father's abdominal issues. Have him/her check the pancreas and the liver for issues too. Be prepared, this may require extensive testing requiring an assortment of visits to the doctor's office and/or hospital to get to the bottom of his ailments. Good luck.",
