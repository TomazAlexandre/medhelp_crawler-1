            "answer": "The localzation of your symptoms to one area of the nervous system is difficult. An abnormality inside the spinal cord in the neck, such as with a syrinx (hollow cavity within the spinal cord) or tumor, can give you that pattern of sensory abnormality - in a cape distribution over the neck and shoulders, and proximal lower extremities. This would be seen on an MRI though, and you seem to hve had this doneAlthough not a typical distribution, a small fiber neuropathy (disease of the very small sensory nerves) can give similar type symptoms - the causes are usually diabetes or pre-diabetes, or amyloid. A much rarer cause might be a sensory ganglionopathy of the ganglion sensory relay station beside the spinal cord - this is unlikely though and an EMG may be helpfeul in ruling this out. Otherwise an EMG is unlikely to be helpful in the setting of pain symptoms only. Other causes of radiculoneuropathy (nerve roots) shoudl be looked for as they are doing - Lyme, diabetes, viral infections. If everything is still negative the only other ivestigation that might help woul be a skin or nerve biopsy looking for inflammation and/or nerve structure changesGood luck",

            "answer": "Continued ...2. If I get a normal EMG, does this rule out a nerve problem?\u00a0\u00a0Or should I insist on further testing (e.g., spinal tap)?3. Would the Lyme test I had detect the European versions of Lyme?\u00a0\u00a0(I spent time hiking and gardening in Europe last summer.)Thank you!!!",

            "answer": "Oct. of last year I started getting lower back pain, it gradually got a little worse to the point where I went to the chiropractor, that didn't do any good so I started getting other tests such as urology work mri on the lower back etc. Now eight months later things have kind of started to change and along with the sore lower back I have sore and tinglling legs and arms with kind of a dull headache, all that don't seem to be subsiding at all, wondering if anyone could give me any ideas what it might be and what I should do next. Also wanted to mention that I felt lightheaded at times. Thank you very much",

    "question": "For almost 4 months, I've had sharp, burning pain and unpleasant shivery sensations starting at my butt and going down both outer/back thighs.\u00a0\u00a0It's unbearable to sit -- my entire sitting area burns, and there's a gnawing pain almost in my pelvic area.\u00a0\u00a0My legs feel heavy and shaky.\u00a0\u00a0Two months ago, I also started having burning pain and hypersensitivity in my neck and shoulders, as well as from both elbows to my fingers (esp. the pinky and ring fingers).\u00a0\u00a0My finger movements are shaky and jerky, and it's difficult to hold them straight.\u00a0\u00a0My arms feel weaker.\u00a0\u00a0I also started having some discomfort -- jerking, twitching, clicking -- in my jaw area.\u00a0\u00a0When I talk, it feels like after I've had a filling -- a bit tingly and stiff.\u00a0\u00a0I've had urinalysis, blood tests (CBC, CPK, thyroid, calcium, blood sugar, ANA, ESR, RF, B12, folate, syphillis, HIV), spinal x-rays, and a lumbar/cervical/brain MRI.\u00a0\u00a0All normal except CPK, which was slightly elevated (206).\u00a0\u00a0The neurologist said she doesn't think I have a neurological problem because I hadn't lost my reflexes (she tried to convince me it was muscle pain).\u00a0\u00a0But she agreed to test me for Lyme (at my insistence -- she said it's unlikely since I don't have meningitis) and send me for an EMG.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a female, age 30, in excellent health prior to this -- no history of illness or injuries.Questions:1. Given all the negative test results, what possibilities remain?\u00a0\u00a0Is my neurologist right, or is Lyme a possibility?\u00a0\u00a0Are there other infectious diseases that can cause these problems?(Please see below ...)",
