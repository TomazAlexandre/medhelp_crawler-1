            "answer": "Hi,High heels can cause problems for anyone, even people without diabetes because they change the way the foot bears weight and how the muscles are used.\u00a0\u00a0Many people as they get older find they cannot wear high heels comfortably.With diabetes, particularly if the person with diabetes has high blood sugars (normal blood sugars for non diabetic persons are typically in the range of 70 -120, and mostly in the 80s and 90s), there can be many problems.These include poor circulation, neuropathy (nerve pain), muscle damage, at worst even ulcers that do not heal.See a podiatrist is a good start.\u00a0\u00a0 Your friend definitely needs to take good care of her feet.\u00a0\u00a0 This may mean reducing the height of heels, or even changing the types of shoes she wears.Exercises can be done to strenghten her feet.\u00a0\u00a0Specific stretching exercises may also be beneficial (high heels shorted the lenght of the archilles tendon).Hope this is of help.",

            "answer": "Hi there! It's so nice of you to try to get advice for your friend. We have a few articles in the Sugar Sense app and on MedHelp.org about foot care for people with diabetes. Hopefully these will help her -- seeing a podiatrist is a great idea, too, as our poster says. She definitely may need to change her shoes!http://www.medhelp.org/diabetes/articles/Why-Kind-Kicks-Are-Key/1704http://www.medhelp.org/diabetes/articles/Treat-Your-Feet/1705http://www.medhelp.org/diabetes/articles/Diabetes-Foot-Care-Checklist/1706",
