    "question": "My mother has been diagnosed with breast cancer in Jan 2008. She felt the lump around June 2007 but refused to visit the doctor at that point. But now after the diagnosis, iIts been a week since she had a masectomy and the results are beginning to trickle in. My mother is India whereas I live in the US, so I do not have the full picture yet.However the results say Stage II 6 invasive/infiltrating ductal carcinoma (not sure what the 6 stands for) and also she had lymph node removal and its says 33 out of 37 had some cancereous cells. The tumor mass was 2.9cm near the outer left quadrant adjacent to the nipple area. There is no metastasis to any other parts of the body as yet (through xray/bone scan). She will begin chemo say in 2-3 weeks time. We have had no other family history of cancer.In terms of common layman, how aggressive is this kind of cancer? What are the 5-year survival rates? She has diabetes and blood pressure as well- will these conditions make the chemo harder or worsen survival rates? She is undergoing the treatment in Bangalore, India but I want to get her here to the US as I feel the facilities/research/treatment options much better here.I am just freaking out reading various things online.Please helpThanksShweta",
