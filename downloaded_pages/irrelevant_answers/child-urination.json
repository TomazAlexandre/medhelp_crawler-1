            "answer": "okay ... does she feel like this only after eating and not before ? I am wondering about her sugar levels .if she could have low blood sugar , hypoglycemia is low , the fact she wakes in the night unwell could mean she had a drop in blood sugar level .I think she should go for a check up at the doctor and have some blood work done .. This doesnt mean diabetes it means the levels are not balanced as they should be ..What time of evening does she have her last meal and what does she eat ?",
