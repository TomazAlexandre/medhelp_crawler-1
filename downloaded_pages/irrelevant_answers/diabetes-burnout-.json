            "answer": "I totally understand! I have been experiencing that too. I often think about my loved ones who help to me encourage because they care so much about my health I should care too. My dad and my boyfriend try to stay on top of me. They don't nag or anything but they just give me friendly reminders. For example, little sticky notes around the house that say did you check your sugar today. I see that and feel kind of guilty and go check it lol.",

    "question": "Hey guys I'm 17 and have now had diabetes for 10 years. More recently I've had a bad case of diabetes burnout where it's just really hard to motivate myself to do the necessary daily things we all have to do. I was curious if anyone else has ever experienced this and how you worked through it? Any suggestions are greatly appreciated :)",
