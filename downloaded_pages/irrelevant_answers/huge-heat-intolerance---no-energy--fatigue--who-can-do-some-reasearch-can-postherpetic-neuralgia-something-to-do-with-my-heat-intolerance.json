            "answer": "You are doing well with your English, but because you are getting stressed about saying the wrong thing you become nervous and this makes it worse for you. Being stressed can make it a difficult situation where it becomes a type of habit. You feel stressed your body reacts and then you notice this reaction so you become more stressed and it gets worse and worse.You can do something about it. You can learn to recognise that you are feeling the stress and the body reacting by stopping talking, and take a deep breath. Focus and calm your self down and tell yourself, in your mind, 'This is ok, I will be ok.' Do this everytime and you will feel less panicky.As for not going out in the summertime and the lack of energy, you might need to get a doctor to check your thyroid and possibly for diabetes and kidney problems. Many people with thryoid illness can not tolerate heat and become very tired very quickly.So I think you have two issues. One, learn to be calm when you feel you might make a mistake with your language skills, and perhaps even go to classes in conversational English to help practice better, and Two get tested for any medical problem you might have.Cheers",

    "question": "I have a huge anxiety from speaking English. English is my second language, I live in the US for 20 years. I have good professional job for 14 years working with public. I am always doing job above and beyond, during 14 years I got several promotion for job well done. I am working in retail as an department manager, I have to speak with customers or employees consistently. Every time I am having conversations I have to concentrate what I am saying, some times words are coming wrong. I have no reason to be so stressed but I can not control it. Over the years as I live with this huge anxiety I became very heat intolerance. Many years ago every time I made mistake during any English conversations I felled very embarrassed and I would get all red when I made this mistake. After many years I saw some different reactions in my body. When i got embarrassed I got very hot in my face but not red at all. Now when I am speaking (having conversation) my breath is getting hot and hotter with every conversations, by end of the day I am totally overheated in my chest, my breath, my tongue, mouth. The moment when I feel embarrassed for any reason or if I get afraid feeling (afraid to pick up the phone, maybe they will not understand me or maybe I will not understand) my face(inside cheeks) will get very hot, my face will get deadly white and I will have no energy. I will be totally drained. My heat intolerance is so bad that I can no eat or drink anything warm, I can not tolerate temperature over 72F- I have no energy, get very tired and hot on cheeks. I had burn inside my cheeks, they are like on fire. I can not go out during summer time, even if the temperature is 72F. My body overheats and I loose all my energy, I have to lay down to get my energy back. Could somebody have ANY answer or suggestion what to do, who to see, who could help me? Thank you for all your responses.",
