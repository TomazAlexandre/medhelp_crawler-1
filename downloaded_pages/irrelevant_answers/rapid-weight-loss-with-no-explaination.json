    "question": "Hi I am a 20 yr old female and over the last couple weeks i have noticed that i have been loosing a considerable amount of weight. I lost 5 pounds in the last 2 weeks. Im 5'-5\" and now weight 125 compared to a couple weeks ago when i weighed around 130-129.\u00a0\u00a0I have also felt weak, tired, cold, dizzy at times and wake in the night from pins and needles in my arms. Im not overactive but work out a couple times a week when i have time. I have also been eating about the same amount of food i usually do. I cant quite figure it out. It just seems that everytime i step on the scale my weight keeps dropping. I have an appointment with a doctor in a few weeks to run some test but i was wondering if anyone had any advice or experience with these problems to help me figure out what it may be so i have a better idea what to do. I also found a lump in my breast and was wondering if maybe that had someting to do with it. Altho, my doctor assured me it may not be serious but i have a biopsy scheduled later on this week. Any advice or insight anyone has would be appreciated.Thanks for listeningQuin",
