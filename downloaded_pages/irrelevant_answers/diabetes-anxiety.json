            "answer": "Your symptoms don't sound typical of diabetes. Without my handy-dandy crystal ball I cannot look into your head and make a determination since you forgot to tell us about your glucose levels, when you test, how long you have had diabetes, your body weight/height, if you are following a diabetic diet, if you exercise daily, and what, if any, medications you are on. You could be experiencing an allergy attack or have some sort of weird infection or have hidden mental issues. Posting on health forums is not going to get answers or resolve your problem, only a hands on evaluation by a doctor will. Good luck",
