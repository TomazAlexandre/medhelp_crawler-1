            "answer": "For diabetes eye stuff-astralagus or Huong Chi (Chinese for Astralagus) is great. I stopped taking it a bit ago and now-oh no!! See www.bluepoppy.com for info on that. Ebselen along with lutein is supposed to be good. I may have enough money left for Ebselen, but I'm not sure about Nepretin-sounds very good though. I didn't reach the point to get shark's cartrilidge, but I know that would help. 35.5 years taking insulin and I'd have to say I have a bunch of Angels watching over me! I now watch TBN amap since I was raised by non-practicing Catholics. Oh, Dr. Richard K. Bernstein is a must-taking insulin over 50 years!",
