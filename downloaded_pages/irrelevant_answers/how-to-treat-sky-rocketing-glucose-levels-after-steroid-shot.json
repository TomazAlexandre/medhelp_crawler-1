            "answer": "Hi Wjammer!\u00a0\u00a0I am not a medical professional, just a volunteer and a mom of a 17 year old who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 21 months.\u00a0\u00a0I recently spoke with a oncology nurse practitioner as my mother-in-law, who is type 2, is being treated with chemo for pancreatic cancer and is receiving an anti-nausea steroid.\u00a0\u00a0Her bg's have been in good range, but the evening after she receives chemo, her bg sky rockets.\u00a0\u00a0The NP stated that this is a direct effect of the steroid and she would not recommend a medication adjustment as it is a temporary reaction or spike and the bg should come down on it's own.\u00a0\u00a0Apparently, this is a typical side effect when a steroid is given.\u00a0\u00a0Please speak to your physician regarding what plan of action is best for you.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

            "answer": "It has been almost a week since the steroid shot I received which drove my bg levels so high.\u00a0\u00a0They have not come down and I'm really not feeling very well.\u00a0\u00a0I feel sick when I eat and sick if I don't eat.\u00a0\u00a0I feel dizzy and thick-headed all the time.\u00a0\u00a0My weight is dropping quickly, yet I'm always hungry.Is this still related to my type II diabetes being temporarily driven out of control by the steriod shot, or is this something else?\u00a0\u00a0How long will this last?\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas anyone?",

    "question": "I have type II diabetes that I have controlled using exercise and diet.\u00a0\u00a0However, recently my fasting glucose levels have crept up into the high 120's low 130's, so I was already sort of out of control.However, yesterday I had a steriod shot given to me in my knee to treat knee pain.\u00a0\u00a0This morning my fasting glucose level was at 320 (that is much higher than I have ever seen it).\u00a0\u00a0Probably to complicate things I went to a birthday party and had cake and ice cream, which I don't usually have.My question is:\u00a0\u00a0How can I get my blood sugar down.\u00a0\u00a0I don't take any meds and really don't do anything other than exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Today, I have not eaten and I did a little exercise, but my glucose reading is still around 230.\u00a0\u00a0Help!\u00a0\u00a0I don't really know what to do.Thanks in advance for anyone that has any advice to offer.",
