            "answer": "Hello,The symptoms that you are having are related to anxiety and panic attacks. The neck symptoms can be due to postural defects. Treatment includes anti anxiety medicines(available on prescription by a physician).When you have such kind of symptoms, Breathe slowly through the nose using the diaphragm and abdomen. Do not breathe through the mouth. Talking with a supportive person \u2014 someone who has experienced true panic attacks personally; someone who is highly trained in treating panic attacks; loved ones who can offer support and comfort. Also use a thin pillow and do not stoop too much while working on computers. The tingling in toe can be due to vitamin B 12 defciency. Take some multivitamins for some days and if the symptoms persist then please consult a physician to get your blood sugar levels evaluated to rule out any diabetes.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing. Warm regards.",
