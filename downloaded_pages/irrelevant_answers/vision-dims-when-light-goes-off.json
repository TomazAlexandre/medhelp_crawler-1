    "question": "For the last 3 years I've experienced a dimming (almost blindness) of my vision in my right eye - it only happens when I turn my bedside lamp off & when I'm laying on my left side (it doesn't happen when the light goes out & I'm laying on my right side).My vision is fine laying on that side until the light goes out.\u00a0\u00a0When the light goes out, I can hold my hand an inch in front of my face & can't see it out of my right eye, but can with the left (I see shadows & the hallway light, but the right takes about 3 to 4 minutes for my vision to return to normal).\u00a0\u00a0It started happening maybe 1 to 2 times a month & now happens 3 to 4 times a week.\u00a0\u00a0I've had my carotid artery checked & it is fine.\u00a0\u00a0I have gotten ocular migraines & the past. My blood work is all normal - no diabetes or high blood.My rx is strong -6.00 both eyes.\u00a0\u00a0I saw an opthomologist 2 years ago & he says the optic nerve & everything look fine.\u00a0\u00a0I wonder if a growth in the brain might be putting pressure on something, because this phenomenon only happens laying down on the left side.Could this be a symptom of MS?\u00a0\u00a0I've not been diagnose with MS, but over the years have had occasional symptoms - tingling, numbness, feelings of electrical shocks in legs, eye pain & feelings of eye fullness.Anyway, is there anyone out there that may be experiencing anything like this - if so what is going on with you?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for listening.",
