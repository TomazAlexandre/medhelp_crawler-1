            "answer": "Hello,Such tingling sensation in clitoris can be due to allergic contact dermatitis or parasthesia skin. Wear cotton underwear and use mild soaps like Dove. Parasthesia is due to dysfunctioning of neurons. It can be due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency, neujrological causes or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms improve. If the symptoms persist then get the above mentioned possibilities ruled out from a neurologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have an irritating tingling feeling of my clitoris. I have had thrush before and it's not the same symptoms. It feels as if an orgasm is building and makes you feel as if you need to pee. I have applied a cold cloth over my underpants which eased it slightly and applied thrush cream which didn't really help. I have resisted the urge to masturbate/use my vibrator. It has developed over the last few days after having used my vibrator and I am worried I have damaged or inflamed nerves. Googling has made it worse as has just caused me to freak out/panic more about it.",
