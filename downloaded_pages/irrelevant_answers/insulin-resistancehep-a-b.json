    "question": "Hi All.I'm a 51 yr old man living in England. Was diagnosed with Hep C Geno 1a in 2003 and have done 48 weeks tx in 2006-7, and 12 weeks in 2009. Inadequate response to both so now have to wait for Telepravier...expecting 3+ years.I've found from the net that Insulin Resistance may be a major factor in the failure of CHC geno 1a patients to respond to tx. At this stage I would like if possible to identify why I failed to respond to tx so I asked my hepdoc if I could be tested for I.R.\u00a0\u00a0and was told he had no knowledge of it but would get back to me. This was 3 weeks ago and I have heard nothing as yet.I have a regular weight of 77kgs and a spare tyre. I also feel and have felt for some years fatigued.The question I am finding difficult to get an answer to is \"am I worrying for no reason over this\"?I also asked about being vaccinated(sp) against hep A and B. I had bloods taken (again 3 weeks ago) for hep B and have heard nothing. Should I make a fuss about this or am I being overly sensitive?I asked about protection from hep A and was told there is no good reason to have this unless I'm going to a part of the world where it is a known problem. Again, should I be making a fuss or not?You will have gathered by now that I'm not too well informed with regard to these problems but would be so gratefull if someone could give me an insight on how to resolve these questions. I'm allocated 15 minutes every 6 months to talk to a doctor and dont seem to get much out of the experience. (was almost thrown out for taking up so much time 3 weeks ago).If it seems that I'm simply a nutjob then by all means let me know...I stopped biting people's heads off a long time ago!Thankyou in advance for any help, and I wish you all the very best of luck. Peter.",
