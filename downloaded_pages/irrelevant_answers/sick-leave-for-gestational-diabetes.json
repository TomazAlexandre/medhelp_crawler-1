            "answer": "If you can afford it and you have insurance you can have your doctor put you on short term disability due to \"pregnancy related medical condition\" I went on short term disability due to stress on 5/8 even though my maternity leave doesn't start until 5/29. I just couldn't deal with work anymor, but my doctor said he would write a note excusing me due to a \"pregnancy related medical condition\" your insurance can't question it. If you do go that route, just be sure you have a weeks worth of vacation because the first week you would be out of work is what is called an \"elimination period\" where you won't get paid by your short term disability. I hope this helps! :)",

    "question": "Hi ladies! Today i was diagnosed with gestational diabetes at 30 weeks :( Ive noticed\u00a0\u00a0that i get lightheaded and dizzy at work and im not sure if it has to do with my blood sugar levels..\u00a0\u00a0in addition to that,\u00a0\u00a0im just exhausted all the time. i dont think sitting for 8 hours straight at work is helping\u00a0\u00a0me out either... is it reasonable to ask my OB to put me on sick leave until the baby arrives? Is anyone else experiencing this as well? Thanks in advance your input u wonderful ladies!",
