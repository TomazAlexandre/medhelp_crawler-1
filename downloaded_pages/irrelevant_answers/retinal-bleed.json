            "answer": "If your father saw a MD eye physician ophthalmologist then he should have the tests the Eye MD recommended. If he saw a non MD optometrist and your daughter in law works for an Eye MD then I would suggest seeing him/her. If they both are optometrists then I would ask his regular doctor to refer him to an Eye MD ophthalmologist.JCH MD",

            "answer": "Thank you for your reply.\u00a0\u00a0My father did see an opthalmologist but he only recommended he get blood tests by his regular GP for diabetes and hemoglobin.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter-in-law works for a different opthalmologist who said he ususally does other testing himself during the actual eye exam if he sees a retinal bleed.\u00a0\u00a0My father's opthalmologist said he was worried about it but then doesn't want to see him again for 6 months and just to follwo up with the GP.\u00a0\u00a0Seems two opthalmologists are taking two really different approaches on this.\u00a0\u00a0Right now the GP has ordered a some blood work.\u00a0\u00a0I just don't know how concerned to be about it or if he should get a second opinion form a different opthalmologist or if this course of action is all that is warranted at this time.Thank you!",

            "answer": "Generally you are best to go with an Eye MD that has looked in the eye. this comes up all the time. It depends on how the blook looks. If just a few splinter, flame \"bleeding area\" then a suggestion to rule out hypertension or diabetes or blood disorder is all that is necessary.Likely save time and money by going with your fathers Eye MD recommendation.JCH MD",
