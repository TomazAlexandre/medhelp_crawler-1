            "answer": "Usually not that fast.There are 2 approaches your doctor can take.\u00a0\u00a0They can either be reactive and/or proactive.\u00a0\u00a0Your docs are being reactive, treating the issues as they become quite apparent.\u00a0\u00a0Since the progression is obviously fast, it's time to become proactive.Are you monitoring your lipid profile, c-reactive protein, lifestyle factors like smoking + weight?\u00a0\u00a0If it were me and the issue was lipids, I'd go on a \"gorilla statin\", like crestor which is strong but shown to reverse stenosis.\u00a0\u00a0That's just one example.\u00a0\u00a0I'd throw everything at the problem.\u00a0\u00a0I would take the issue seriously with the docs.\u00a0\u00a0Going from fine to 7 stents in less than a year indicates something that requires proactive steps.",

Also, I have a hard time exercising because of the neuropathy and also I experience chest pressure and severe aching down my left arm upon exertion. I am going to begin Cardiac Rehab in one week.

            "answer": "With your low HDL and diabetes it sounds like part of the problem might be a metabolic disorder.\u00a0\u00a0There is too much bad stuff in your blood (sugars and harmful lipids) and not enough good stuff like HDL.\u00a0\u00a0When this happens it causes damage to your vascular system.\u00a0\u00a0The body's reaction to the damage causes the arteries to harden and narrow.\u00a0\u00a0 It's similar to what happens to smokers.I'm wondering what's up with the HDL because lipitor raises HDL.How's your diet?\u00a0\u00a0How's your weight?\u00a0\u00a0Do you smoke?",

    "question": "Hello, I'm new here so I apologize for any errors I may make. I am a 41 yr.old female.In Nov. 2010, I was admitted to ER for chest pain. On day 3 the resident stood in the corner of my hospital room and told me nothing was wrong with me...I was \"probably just depressed\".I continued to deal with the pains until Feb.2011. That morning I woke up with such heaviness in my chest and the worst ache ever going through my left arm. I called my doctor. He said to call 911...I asked if there was something we could do on the phone because the hospital would just tell me I'm depressed. He said no so I did call 911. In ER, they told me nothing was wrong with me...all tests are normal...but because I keep complaining...my cardiologist said he would come in the following day and do a cardiac cath.On the morning of the cath. my cardiologist looked in my eyes and told me...\"I'm sure it's not your heart...I know it's not your heart but we will just do this cath. anyway just to get it over with...you had a cath 6 years ago and it was fine....So, I know it's NOT your heart.\"\u00a0\u00a0As soon as he started, the cardiologist said, \"oh, you have 2 blockages. Well, I don't do angioplasty so someone else will be right in...and he LEFT. The next dr. comes in and says, \"he say u have 2 blockage....u have FIVE\". He put in 4 stents and opened one blockage with a double balloon.I was fine until April 2011, when I began experiencing the same symptoms as I had in Nov 2010 & Feb.2011. Cardiologist #2 did another cath....said \"everything was NORMAL\"....which later on I was told \"it wasn't critical at THAT time.Still complaining all the way to June 2011, the office decides I need a stress test. I went to ER again for same symptoms, they would not release me until my cardiologist saw me. Cardiologist #3 came in and told me my stress test was positive and that he needed to get me in the cath lab STAT. So, another stent is placed and I am \"FINE\". 6 weeks later, I am just getting home from the hospital, which I was at from Monday until Thursday. I had two more stents put in, now I have 7 stents. I still have 2 arteries that are 20% blocked...one new one and one where they put a stent in in Feb. My question is, how quickly do these blockages happen? I mean since they just put a stent in in June and now in July a new blockage (90% blocked) occurs.I appreciate any input you may have.Thank you.",
