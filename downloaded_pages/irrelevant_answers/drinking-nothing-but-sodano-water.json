            "answer": "If it isn't good for momma, it isn't good for baby! A 12-ounce can of soda contains about ten teaspoons of sugar which goes along with how important it is to have a steady insulin level for babies growth. 1 you don't want gestational diabetes 2 why would you want to pump that much sugar into your body and babies? That much caffeine isn't good either but also could contributes to dehydration and constipation.Four 12-ounce cans of soda a day come to about 600 calories. That translates to a pound of extra fat gain a week, putting you at risk for a more difficult delivery and increasing the chances you might develop gestational diabetes. These are \"empty calories,\" meaning they don't provide any of the nutrition you need. Carbonation also robs your body of calcium.You owe it to your health\u2014and that of your baby\u2014to have as pure a diet as possible during your pregnancy. Maybe try la Croix water, it's natural flavored and has carbonation. Once you totally cut soda out of your life you'll feel really good. You stopped now, that's all that matters!",
