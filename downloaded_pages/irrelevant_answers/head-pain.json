            "answer": "Hi Cinderella,Welcome to the Pain Mangement Forum. I am glad that you found us at MedHelp.You are young and this would tend to limit the possibility of some serious conditions such as a CVA (stroke) or hypertension. Does ice help relieve the headaches?However being young there are some infectious diseases that you would want to have ruled out. And of course Aneurysms know no age limit and it is a small possibility that you may want to have investigated.Most common thought would be that you may be experiencing a nasty headache, a tension headache or possibly a cervical alignment issue.I suggest that you consult your PCP. Our members may have additional suggestions for you also.Please let us know how you are doing. I will look forward to your updates.Take Care,~Tuck",

            "answer": "I agree with Tuck on this one, you need to see your PCP about this. It could be something non-serious, but you will want to rule out the serious stuff just to be safe.Good luck and keep us posted,~Dame",

    "question": "The past two days I have had pains in the lower right hand side of my head, they are throbbing pains that seem to come and go. I've taken tylenol for them and they go away for a few minutes but always come back. I just recently had blood work done, and had my blood pressure checked. I'm young, 25, with a family history miles long. Heart attacks, strokes, diabetes. What is going on with me?",
