            "answer": "At this moment I can speculate that the TSH number was elevated.Determining the thyroid volume by palpation is not accurate method, that why they sending you for the ultrasound.The ultrasound will show if any nodules are present, their type, size and shape, as well as the size of the gland.The range of normal thyroid volume must be from 9 to 18 cu cm for women and 8 to 22 cu cm for men.30 % of 30 years old people have small benign nodules in their thyroids seen only on the ultrasound. You can however detect some large nodules yourself by performing AACE recommended thyroid neck check.",

My symptoms are type II diabetes, recent rapid weight gain, hot, swelling hands, lethargic, mood swings, ovarian cysts, pain in the area of my kidneys during stress, etc.",
