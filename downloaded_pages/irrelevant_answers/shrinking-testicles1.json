            "answer": "Hello Sir,The etiologies of shrinking testicles could be numerous, usually hormonal or testosterone imbalances will cause this problem. Are you taking any medications? Are you taking any steroids? Are you a heavy weight lifter? A proper history and physical examination will be required to determine why your testicles are shriking. Also factors like underwear are important as well. If they have become significantly smaller than the were previously, you should consult a urologist. If you have been taking any kinds of medications which are not for severe medical problems (diabetes, hypertension), or taking herbal supplements, discontinue them and see what happens. If you should experience more shrinking/severe pain/or cold sensation to your scrotum, there could be a vascular compromise to your blood flow and an ultrasound of your testicles would be required.Thanks!",

            "answer": "Hello Sir,If your testicles are half the size they used to be, studies would be appropriate. It is possible that you have an endocrine problem (problems with hormones) but it does not seem like vascular compromise is suspicious. You should have your circulating testosterone levels checked, in addition to FSH and LH levels. Consultation with a urologist in your area is probably the appropriate way to begin, a proper history and physical exam will be necessary, especially if you are now experiencing erectile dysfunction. At this time it seems as though it is a hormonal imbalance, and not as a result of hypertension and diabetes, but without a full evaluation, it is not possible for me to determine.Thanks! Let me know if we can provide any additional help.",
