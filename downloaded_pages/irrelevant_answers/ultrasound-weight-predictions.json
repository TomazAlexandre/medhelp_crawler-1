            "answer": "I wouldnt read too much into them. When I went into labor after water breaking with my son at exactly 40 weeks they did an ultrasound to see how he was facing when I got to the hospital... they estimated he would be almost 9lbs... scared the crap out of me... 23 hrs later (I had a long labor) he was born at 7lb 1oz. They say they can be off by 1-2lbs.",

            "answer": "Why are people scared to have big babies anyway? 9 or 10 pound babies are no harder to birth, it's actually the smaller ones that get stuck because their heads done stretch out the vagina as much so their shoulders become stuck. I birthed a 9 pound baby and I was fine.",

            "answer": "I heard they could be 1-2lbs off that ultrasound isn't accurate. @mog_x my mom said I was her biggest baby out of 5 kids and I was 8lbs 2oz and she said she'll never forget that pain that it felt like I was ripping her bottom half off. Also my sister and cousin had 9lb babies said it was the most awful thing ever my sister said she should of delivered c section and it made my cousin never want to have anymore kids so hearing stories like makes me very scared of having big babies!",

        {
            "answer": "I can tell you exactly why... because that is a big baby to push out and if your already scared about labor or having your 1st baby then having a big baby makes you more nervous. A 9-10lb baby is the size of most 1 to 2 months old not a typical newborn size. I had a friend who gave birth to a 10lb baby all natural and she ripped completely to her anus. Hearing horror stories like that dont help either.",
