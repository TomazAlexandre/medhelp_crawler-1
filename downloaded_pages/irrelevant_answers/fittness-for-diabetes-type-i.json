            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.I doubt that masturbation will cause a problem with your diabetes. However, is there someone in your life that you can speak to about feeling lonely? You mention that you feel very weak. Is this keeping you from your normal activities. If so I would recommend speaking with your doctor. There may be something your doctor can suggest to help with the weakness.Cathy",
