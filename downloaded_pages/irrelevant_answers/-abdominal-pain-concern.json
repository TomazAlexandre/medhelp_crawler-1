            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Fluctuating pain in the abdomen and back can be due to gas. If she is overweight and exercises little she could be having hypothyroidism, PCOS, or diabetes which could be causing gas. This needs to be ruled out first. Other than that it can be a kidney stone or urinary bladder infection.Please consult her PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
