            "answer": "hey, here is a possible...I had the exact symptoms last summer. The pain would radiate around the ribs to my back. While in for mamogram I ask the examiner. She said she believed it was a pulled muscle at the \"zyphoid process\". She suggested I confirm with a doctor. Sure enough that is what he said, and I didn't even volunteer the examiners idea until after the doctor said it. I had forgotten what she called it. Apparently it is muscles torn away from the ribcage, just at the junction of the sternum. He said there is really nothing he can do. Just let it heal and avoid lifting or anything else that aggravates it. A continued tear can result in a hernia and they are difficult to repair, as it is heard to sew to rib....bad thing\u00a0\u00a0is he said it takes 6 months to heal. It is now 8 months later and I am no better. So I am not much help other than to put a name to it.",
