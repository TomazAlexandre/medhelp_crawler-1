            "answer": "Hi Cody,I am glad to see that you are trying to control your cardiovascular risk factors.\u00a0\u00a0There isn't much difference in blood pressure control between different\u00a0\u00a0ACEI at max dose.\u00a0\u00a0Once you maximize one ACEI it is usually time to try another class of antihypertensive.The next step I usally have is to add a calcium channel blocker like norvasc.\u00a0\u00a0Diuretics and beta blockers are also decent second agents, but there is increasing evidence that they may cause an increased incidence of type II diabetes.If you have been on Altace for two weeks now and are still hypertensive, I would add a second agent like norvasc.I hope this\u00a0\u00a0answers your question.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and thanks for posting.",

            "answer": "Hmm, that's interesting what the doctor mentioned.\u00a0\u00a0Two people in my family developed type II diabetes within a couple of years of beginning beta blockers despite improvements in their dietary risk factors.Anyhow, just wanted to say your attention to your health is inspiring.\u00a0\u00a0Staying active, keeping tabs on the numbers, I wish I could talk half as much sense into my husband!",

Bad enough having to live with this condition and now finding out the meds I am on can cause another serious condition.\u00a0\u00a0I EAT VERY VERY HEALTHY and exercise religiously...I guess that is all I can do and pray a lot. It sure can get stressful at times living with this.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hope everyone on here is doing WELL.",
