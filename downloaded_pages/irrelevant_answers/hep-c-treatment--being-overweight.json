            "answer": "There are numerous articles written on a lesser response to treatment for those with a higher BMI. Now more focus seems to be on insulin resistance, and may have accounted for earlier statistics relating to BMI.Insulin resistance has been widely discussed here..do a search for more info.http://www.natap.org/2003/oct/102403_8.htm",

            "answer": "Hello peaches.\u00a0\u00a0I had the same concern and, furthermore, I am 64 and have Diabetes II.\u00a0\u00a0I had all sorts of fantasies about how drugs would get stuck in my fat tissue and never make it to the virus or of how my insulin resistance would make me a poor candidate for treatment or I would gain even more weight etc.\u00a0\u00a0Read my blog re my early results of the treatment I am on now.\u00a0\u00a0It didn't make a darn bit of difference (so far).\u00a0\u00a0Supposedly insulin resistance can make things difficult but it didn't for me and my blood sugar is still not normal.\u00a0\u00a0Also, and you may already know this, but it is my understanding that the real bugaboo is not so much the progression from HepC to cirrhosis but the progression of fatty liver disease to cirrhosis which can be much more of a concern and a reason to not dawdle too long over whether to treat.\u00a0\u00a0I would expect though, that the treatment might be more uncomfortable since, if you take Ribaviron, you will need to take a higher dose depending on your weight (it jumps after 75 kg) but I will defer to others on this issue.",

            "answer": "I do have to say that the upper limit BMI in my study was 35 and I would imagine its a good idea to keep it under that.\u00a0\u00a0All I really cared about though was keeping my weight under 165 so I wouldn't have to take more Ribaviron.",

    "question": "OK, I don't think I am going to lose this weight before I start treatment in Oct. I am about 40 pounds overweight and I heard that it's not good when on treatment. I know that it is unhealthy anyway, but my question is, can me being overweight stop my treatment from getting rid of this hep c?",
