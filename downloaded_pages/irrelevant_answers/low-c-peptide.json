            "answer": "Hi Strawberri,Good to hear your pain is better controlled. Definitely watch the constipation--may be time to increase your fiber supplements.A low C-peptide can happen in either Type 1 or a late Type 2 where you have exhausted your pancreatic islet cells. In either case it means you need supplemental insulin.A murmur is a sound made by the heart valves or other structures in the heart when blood passes through them. Different problems cause different murmurs, and some are simply \"innocent murmurs\" cause by high blood flow(like in pregnant women).Hope this helps,take care.",

    "question": "Dr. I got the results for my blood test, and the Dr said my c-peptide was very low and my A1C was 6.9, he changed me from Oxycodone ER to Morphine 15mgs Er. It has helped the pain in my body alot. I am more constipated than before though. Isn't that kinda strange having a low c-peptide test and a 6.9 A1C? He aske me to start taking Rice N Shine to help my Immune system and blood sugars and weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0He gave me a weeks sample. I found it unusual of a Dr. to sugest something Natural, but he said he and others in the office have seen great results from taking this. He alos said I have a loud Mermur caused from the strep he said. What is a Murmer?\u00a0\u00a0I need to lose 17 more lbs he said. I thought a low c-peptide was a sigh of type 1. Thank u for all your past help",
