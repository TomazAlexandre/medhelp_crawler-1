            "answer": "Hi Kanebaby, I am a volunteer and not a physician so I can only speak from experience of living with Type 1 diabetes for 30 years. This is a question that plagues most diabetics. Maintaining control overnight is a very tricky situation and takes a lot of trial and error to get it right. Unfortunately you make find the right dosage of medication that will be just right and suddenly something will change so that dosage no longer is appropriate. My best advise, which I received from my doctor was initially set my alarm to test my blood sugar at differnent times overnight to determine how my blood sugar is reacting. One night it may be 3am the next night 1am etc, this gives you an idea of what is happening and at what hour it may be getting too low. Once you can determine this you can adjust your medication accordingly. You may have to do this as things change perhaps you may have a low blood sugar overnight. I personally sleep with juice boxes next to my bed so I can easily treat the problem if I have to. You must discuss with your doctor any low blood sugar episodes, they will be able to help you make adjustments. If you live with family members they should know how to react to a low blood sugar, if you live alone you may have to always set your alarms to check. But again talk to your doctor they are truly the experts. After 30 years I still have overnight lows once in a while. Best of luck I am sure you will learn quickly how to best care for your body.

            "answer": "Hi KaneBaby,I'm another volunteer & I agree with Kanebaby.You might also set your alarm for a few nights so that you force yourself to wake up to test at say midnite & 3am.\u00a0\u00a0You will lose a little sleep but gain peace of mind.\u00a0\u00a0Once you find your patterns, you'll be able to \"just\" go to sleep.Plan to do checks during the night, tho', when your routine changes (a day of gardening, illness, stress, travel).Good luck and do stay in touch with your doctor as you work with your new med.\u00a0\u00a0If you're on insulin, talk with him/her also about how to adjust dosing.\u00a0\u00a0It's easier to take more/less insulin than it is to take a fraction of a pill ;-)",

Thanks for any help.",
