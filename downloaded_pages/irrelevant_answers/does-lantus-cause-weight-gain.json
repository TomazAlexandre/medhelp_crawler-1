            "answer": "I have noticed a 30 pound weight gain in the past 9 months. My doctor told me that as long as I take insulin I will gain weight. However the question is; Is it the Lantus or the Novolog. When my glucose levels were out of control and I went in to see the doctor on a Tuesday, by the Friday, I had gained 15 pounds and steadily gaining. I am at the point now where I am trying to cut 95% of the carbs out of my diet and increase my physical activity so that I can reduce the need for Novolog, loose weight and eventually loose my need for Lantus as well. Prayerfully this will work. The doctor said that loosing at least 15 pounds would take my insulin dependency level down.",
