            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Get your thyroid tested. Increased sweating is seen in hyperthyroidism and involves mainly the head and neck region. Other endocrine gland related conditions like acromegaly and glucose control disorders (diabetes and hypoglycemia both) all result in increased sweating. Pheochromocytoma, cancers, carcinoid syndromes, tuberculosis and other infections too can cause increased sweating. It can also be due to low blood pressure. Get your adrenal gland function tested also. Wear loose clothes. Carry an astringent and a deodorant. Do not be over anxious about this as this will increase sweating. Easier said than done, but you have to try meditation and yoga to calm your self. Avoid too much of tea, coffee, smoking and spicy food.\u00a0\u00a0Please discuss this with your doctor and get yourself investigated accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0Take care!",
