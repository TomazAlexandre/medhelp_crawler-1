            "answer": "Sabien - Your question caught my attention so I'll get right to the point. I'm 5'7\" and weigh 152 lbs. This is normal weight for my height. To say \"Slightly overweight, 215lbs 5 foot 8.\" is not being honest to yourself. Period.\"I just started to do more exercise now.\" This is good but maintain a schedule. Walking is good to help shed the excess weight. I'm not talking around the block but 2-4 miles daily until you're down to normal weight. Losing weight will help with your fatigue factor and lift your spirits too.I was once a technical operations director for a large compute firm in Silicon Valley. The most fatigued employees drank excessive amounts of soda and ate junk food constantly. If you do, cut it out. A good diet will improve your health.When you had your CBC did the doctor order labs for the followingChemistry:Creatinine (kidney function)GlucoseHemoglobin A1CSerology:Hepatitis A, B, C (surface Core, antibody)If your current PCP doesn't agree with further blood work, go find one that does until you get to the bottom of cause of your fatigue.Good luck and good health.",

            "answer": "Also have your thyroid checked and a glucose test for diabetes(or whatever\u00a0\u00a0test the doc chooses to do) But make sure it is done.\u00a0\u00a0What was your triglycerides #?\u00a0\u00a0 Does high chol. run in your family?\u00a0\u00a0If it does you should be put on a statin to help lower it.\u00a0\u00a0Diet and excercise too! you are what the doctor would call obese. I am too, 50lbs overweight is considered obese. If you are not used to an excercise schedule start tomorrow morning.\u00a0\u00a0Walk atlease 20 mins everyday for a week. The next week walk 25 mins everyday for a week. The next week walk 30 mins etc.\u00a0\u00a0Go the same speed everyday for the first month then speed up abit for the next month. Work on your walking time and speed until you are walking a mile in\u00a0\u00a0approx. 12 minutes. So if you can walk that, you will be walking 4 miles in 48 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0Just keep that up until you hit a plateau. Like not weight loss for 2 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Then you'll need to add a mile to your walk- that would be 60 minutes. Everytime you hit a plateau and still feel the need to lose weight just add a 12 minute mile. Do this for the rest of your life and you will decrease your chances of diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, depression, weak muscles that are easily injured, back problems (watch your walking posture)& so much more. If the weather doesn't permit you to walk safely, go to a mall to walk or join the YMCA and have inside walking and get a trainer to help you with weights, strength training. If you can't make time in the early morning make time at lunch.\u00a0\u00a0But don't excercise with-in 4 hrs of your bedtime. Stay away from sugary carbs, eat more protein,fish, complex carbs, fresh fruits and veggies. Don't fry your foods unless you use spray on oil or virgin oil, baking, broiling and steaming is best. Ease up on the pasta and potatoes, skip sauces, gravy, dressings, breads, and pastries & such.\u00a0\u00a0Eliminate these foods little by little so you won't just give up. Make sure you do the walking though. A stationary bike is good to.Start at 5 miles a day for a week then\u00a0\u00a06,7,8,9... Work up to 10 miles a day at 20 MPH If that's too easy do it farther, longer,harder.\u00a0\u00a0Whatever gives you the results: Atleast 2 pounds a week until you hit a plateau or your correct weight. Then add or maintain it. Just Do It",
