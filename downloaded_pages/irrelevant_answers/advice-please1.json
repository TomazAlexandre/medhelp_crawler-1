            "answer": "Hi,Have you consulted a physician for your condition? Was it a physician who gave you a diagnosis of a fungal infection?This may be a case of candidal balanitis.Balanitis may be due to a bacterial or fungal infection and usually involves the head of the penis.In your case a bacterial infection such as folliculitis may also be considered as a differential as you have mentioned that your pubic area is also involved.Do you have a strong family history of diabetes?Avoid any possible irritants such as strong soaps and tight underpants. Use clothing of cool and light materials only. Also refrain from any sexual activity for the moment until your condition is properly assessed. Avoid unnecessarily manipulating the area and also avoid sharing towels and other personal items.Discuss your medications with your physician. You may need to change or modify this.",
