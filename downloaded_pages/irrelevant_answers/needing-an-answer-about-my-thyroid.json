    "question": "Ok so here is my question?\u00a0\u00a0I have hypothyroidism, and after telling my Dr for some time that my heart beat was too fast they finally did tests too discover I was taking too much....way too much, so: fine the tablets were reduced and although my heart beat is not as rappid as it was there are still problems, I still feel ill.\u00a0\u00a0My heart beat can become fast one minute/day and perfectly normal for a few days after, My T4 was through the roof and my T3 was hardly noticable at all. Something somewhere is not balanced,\u00a0\u00a0I am continuously hot......... when I am normally very cold, , and if I take a little nap.............say 20 minutes laid on the couch, when I wake up I feel drunk!!\u00a0\u00a0and I dont drink!\u00a0\u00a0Its awful and no one seems to be able to shed light on it. I have had an ultra sound on my thyroid and a brain scan and all normal........... iron levels are low but thats nothing new!!\u00a0\u00a0The only extra annoying thing is that my back itches ....... although not as much lately and on my chest I have lightened spots........which is weird too..they have been there for about 2 years too, looks like dry skin but it is not..I can come over all funny one minute and feel perfectly fine the next, as soon as what ever it is calms down... which normally takes about an hour, but it is driving me nuts!!\u00a0\u00a0I am not a person that is easily ill, I dont get colds, I have never been anxious in my life and I am so outgoing that what ever it is getting annoying and this has been on going for 2 years now,\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone shed any light on this!!\u00a0\u00a0There rant over lol!!!",
