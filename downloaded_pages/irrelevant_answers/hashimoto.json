    "question": "Hi,I was dx. with Hashimoto several yrs ago and have been on 88mcg of levothyroxine since. Over the past 6mos. I have been extremely exhausted and the typical low thyroid symptoms. I also have had severe flare ups in my neck where I have 3 levels fused as well as increased shoulder inflammation where I had surgery over a yr ago . Both surgeons told me they do not understand why I have such inflammation per mri and just inject me with steroids. 3 months ago I started on loestrin for perimenopausal sympts that are so severe , including continual sweating , that it was necessary. Since the start of the loestrin , all of my symptoms have been so severe I am missing work . Today my Md. just increased my levothyroxine to 100mcg but did give me the option of the cytomel route. .I just want to feel better. I am aware that loestrin can cause levothyroxine ineffective. I am 53 and feel like 153. I just want to sleep constantly up to 15 hrs a day. Can you tell me what would be the best option for me? btw, my t3 t4 tsh normal low, antibodies high. Thanks so much for any advice you can give. I have a feeling the 100mcg wont be enough to make me feel better either but my Endocrinologist is very conservative. Thanks",
