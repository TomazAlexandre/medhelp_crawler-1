            "answer": "Having a severe low can make a person appear to be drunk and do things that are not normal for them.\u00a0\u00a0When some people are high they also behave differently. I would recommend that your brother talk to his lawyer and his doctor, that he give them permission talk to each other about his condition. (Due to new HIPPA regulations he will need to give them both written permission.)\u00a0\u00a0Together they might be able to prove that it was related to diabetes.Your brother could have been low at the time of the accident, but due to the stress have shot up to a high.\u00a0\u00a0Does your brother where identification showing the police that he is type 1?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hope all goes well.\u00a0\u00a0My prayers and thoughts are with your brother.",
