            "answer": "I had to do this too. Your DR. office or lab didn't give you a prep. list and ideas of what kinds of servings and foods to eat? Your suppose to eat normally and add 10 extra servings of carbs each 3 days. Breads- white or rye: 1 slice is one serving. 1 cup of cereal- grape nuts, ban flakes, etc. Mash potatoes, baked potatoes, french fries. Lots of pasta- 1 cup is a serving. I threw my list out last week because I passed. Sorry I can't think of anything else. Maybe you should call your DR. and ask them too. Good Luck sweetie!!! Hope you pass!! :)",

I have the test tomorrow morning, sucks! Also, stop eating after 10PM the night before the test.",

            "answer": "Thank you ladies! It seems though some variability among your responses, I should follow a regular healthy/balanced food plan but add in extra carbs and fruits, but still avoid sweets/desserts. I'm just worried about all this and want to do whatever I can to change the results for the 3 hour test, so even though I generally eat this way I want to do something different before the test. I know it's not necessarily an awful outcome for me or my baby even if I am diagnosed with gestational diabetes, but I worked hard before getting pregnant to lose 30 lbs (though now I'm back up 20 lbs in week 27 of pregnancy) and still exercising daily to try to prevent diabetes, but I guess this may not have been enough to prevent it. We'll see how the longer test comes out. Best to you taking it today/tomorrow! Let me know what happens if you pass it or not.",

    "question": "I just found out I failed the gestational diabetes screening. The nurse told me to avoid simple sugars and eat carbs for next 3 days (and fast night prior) before I have the 3 hour test. I'm confused b/c I figure simple sugars are desserts like candy, cookies, etc but sugar is in most things like milk, fruit, pasta but she said to eat carbs, and I thought carbs turn into sugar, so what food plan should I follow for next 3 days in prep for the test? I'm really worried b/c I exercise everyday and watch what I eat to avoid getting diabetes, as I am overweight even though I lost some weight before getting pregnant.",
