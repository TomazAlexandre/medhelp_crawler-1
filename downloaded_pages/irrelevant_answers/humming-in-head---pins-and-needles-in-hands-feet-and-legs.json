            "answer": "I have in the past had the exact same symptoms when I would drink too much over many days, and then stop. It would last for many days after I had stopped drinking, and then go away completely. I can't say what your problem is/was, but mine certainly was due to alcohol abuse. I wish you luck, and hope it has cleared up for you because I know what torture it is. Also, pins, needles, and on some occasions, peripheral neuropathy are quite common with the onset of diabetes.",
