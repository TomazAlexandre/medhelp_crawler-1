A low fat high carb \"diet\" just makes the pancreas work harder than it needs too!\u00a0\u00a0 and can cause the pancreas to quit working earlier.The diet you need to be on is a low carb diet.",

            "answer": "Thank you again for the informative replies! :)When i get to see my doctor, i will ask about a possibly new pill, like normal Metformin.And then it seems i also should eat less carbohydrate..i do not know why so much was prescribed for me, maybe because i am too skinny :sThx for the advice for the book!With my 1 hour results from the OGTT i was not sure if the 214.2 mg/dl could mean diabetes because it is above 200, or this is only valid, if it is normal food not the 75 gramm glucose, but then it seems that was also an alerting sign :sGreetings!:)",
