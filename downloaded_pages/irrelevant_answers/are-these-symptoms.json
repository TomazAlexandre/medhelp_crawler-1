            "answer": "I'm not a doctor and can't give you any information on genetic probabilities of getting diabetes, but I can certainly relate to the anxiety of wondering if,what,and when this disease might befall you.You are definitely doing the right thing in being aware of any syptoms and having your glucose checked.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like this may be a good time for you to have a complete physical to rule out any other medical issues.\u00a0\u00a0Of all of your symptoms, thirst and urination would be the most obvious concerns.\u00a0\u00a0Some of the other symptoms could be related, but not necessarily, although I have heard that hypoglycemia (low Blood sugar) is sometimes a precursor to Type I diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Your best bet in this area is to eat frequent healthy meals with a good balance of complex carbs (whole grains) and protein and go lightly on the high fat, high sugar items.It is, however, important to know that eating does not cause Type I or Insulin Dependent Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Type 2 Diabetes is often caused by obesity and overeating to the point that the body becomes unable to produce enough insulin to cover the food being eaten.\u00a0\u00a0In those situations, losing weight and exercising can often eliminate the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Oral medications are given to increase the production of insulin or to increase the bodies ability to absorb and utilize the insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Type 2 diabetes often happens in older people, but is now being seen more in younger people who are very overweight.This is in contrast to Type I Diabetes which is not caused by what you eat.\u00a0\u00a0Although I am no doctor, I know there are\u00a0\u00a0genetic factors and some indications that there is an autoimmune response that may cause Type I diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The result is that the body produces no insulin and therefore requires insulin by injection in order to survive.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure which kind of diabetes your family members have, but your awareness indicates that it might be the Type I variety in which case, wha you eat will noy ultimately influence your getting diabetes or not.\u00a0\u00a0Although, it never hurts to have healthy eating habits.As far as the glucose testing that you will receive at the doctor's office, there are several types.\u00a0\u00a0One is a finger ***** to test the presence of sugar in your blood at that moment.\u00a0\u00a0This is actually the way we diabetics monitor our own blood sugars and insulin intake. If you are concerned about diabetes, you can always puchase a home monitor and test when you feel you have a concern, but don't do this if it will just make you crazy.\u00a0\u00a0The other test is a glucose tolerance test which tests how quickly and effectively your body utilizes sugar.\u00a0\u00a0This test takes several hours and is a process of drinking a sweet liquid and then getting your blood tested over a period of time to see how it deals with the sugar intake.\u00a0\u00a0This test can only be done at the doctor's office and it sounds like it may be a good place for you to start.I hope things turn out well at your doctor's visit.\u00a0\u00a0If you do happen to have diabetes, please write us back. There is a lot of support available to you.\u00a0\u00a0There are also a whole bunch of us out here who have been living successfully with diabetes for 20, 30 and for me, 40 years now.\u00a0\u00a0It's not a great disease to have and we all wish we didn't have it, but it hasn't stopped any of us from leading full, active and productive lives. Good luck to you.Es",

    "question": "Hi, I'm 21 and I have relatives on both sides of my family who are diabetic. With the fact that this disease runs in my family, and some worries and possible symptoms, I am going to be tested next week to make sure everything is okay. I have noticed that when I go a little longer without eating, or sometimes even when I wake up, I feel extremely faint and light-headed, and sometimes I develop a headache. I have heard that this is low blood sugar. Then, sometimes when I eat too much sugar, I get one of those \"sugar headaches.\" Lately, say in the past month, I have had an increase in thirst and urination. I also somehow developed what seems like acid reflux (excessive belching, but not really much acid) and also sometimes I feel like I have a few inflamed taste buds that stick out from my tongue and burn and are irritated or sometimes have no feeling at all. I don't know how or why this would have developed. I'm young, not overweight (though I have gained weight over the past year and don't get as much exercise as I used to), and I had never had any problems with this acid reflux thing until about 3 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0I'm thinking this could all be diabetes-related. I just want to make sure. Has anyone else had any type of symptoms like these or similar? Let me know what you guys think. Also, any tips for preparing for a diabetes test? What should I tell the doctor, what should I expect? thanks!",
