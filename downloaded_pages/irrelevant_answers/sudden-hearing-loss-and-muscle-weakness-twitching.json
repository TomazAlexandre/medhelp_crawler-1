            "answer": "As for twitching & weakness, you might want to look up Magnesium rich foods and see if you are getting enough. If you think you might be deficient, try taking a Magnesium supplement and see if your twitching subsides.http://dietary-supplements.info.nih.gov/factsheets/magnesium.aspSome medications, as you will find, deplete magnesium. Too, magnesium may interfere with certain medications so be sure to read up on this prior to taking supplementation.I do believe stress can exasperate, if not cause twitching on occasion.Good luck!",

            "answer": "I suffer a rare autimune disease, Hyshimotos Encephalopathy, onset\u00a0\u00a03 years ago. With the onset, I received many tests, spinal taps, brian biopsy, chemo (immune supressant), mega dosages of steroids, Plama Frese (sp?) and a cathiter to my chest (after 3 months of living in the hosp not knowing what I had). I got an infestion from this. I am taing a medication that suppress my immune system, CellCept. I was given an IV antibotic, not sure which one, for appox. two weeks. Since the antibotic, I now suffer hearing loss to my left ear and partial to my right. I have had numerous tests done thinking it would improve. Has not. Just this week to went to see a differnt Audiologist who suggested it might be a result of the antibotic I was given. Any suggestions and where I go from here? Thanks for you comments.
