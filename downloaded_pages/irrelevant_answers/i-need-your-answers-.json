I'm 11+5 weeks and its been happening since 8 weeks. & I'm good also, as in no diabetes. I have no Idea if this is normal. I was so overwhelmed and filled with joy at my first appointment and all of my questions went straight out the door. But I will definitely be asking my doctor this coming Thursday at my next appointment. Good luck.",
