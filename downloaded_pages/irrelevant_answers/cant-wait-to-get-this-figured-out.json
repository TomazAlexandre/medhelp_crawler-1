            "answer": "Hi, and welcome to this wonderful forum here on Medhelp.Gosh you sound like you are having a hardtime.with all the symptoms.My first thing i would mention is have you been tested for diabetes insipidus? If not then i would mention it to your doctor for further testing.Also you talk of headaches , tinnitus, and leg cramps, along with fatigue and many more symptoms....I know you look to have had an endocrine work-up, missing the testing for diabetes, and diabetes insipidus...Well i think you need a good auto-immune work -up, these can be done with a good rheumatologist, and maybe if you find a good neurologist, he might do it also.Also regarding the headaches and tinnitus, which have not responded to conventional treatment.I would highly reccommend, getting tested for APS/Hughes Syndrome.The two tests you would need for this, and can be carried out at a doctors surgery, very simply are.ACA= Anticardiolipin Antibodies... and also LA = Lupus Anticoagulant.You usually need two positive bloodtests over the space off about 8-12 weeks, depending on who is your doctor.If however you do test positive then you need to find a good specialist in this condition as this is a auto-immune blood disorder, which can mimic many auto-immune diseases, especially MS.This condition, can cause all different kinds of symptoms, ranging from temperature changes, pins, and needles, cramps anywhere in the body, with chronic migraine type headaches, along with balance, memory, and hearing and vision problems.I hope this has helped you, and im sure you will get plenty of feed back on this forum,Im bumping this post up for further ideas.Good LuckNicola",

            "answer": "Thank you so much. I will definitely ask my doctor about the Hughes syndrome, The doctor is currently looking into Diabetes Insipidus. They have pretty much ruled out Addison's disease and Cushing's disease.Found out today that my kidneys are functioning well given the amount of urine that is coming through.Woke up this morning with the bottom of both of my feet aching. They are aching at this moment as well. This is so bizarre.",

    "question": "Hello,I never thought that I would be posting my symptoms online to try and get input from other people but I am feeling a bit hopeless when it comes to finding an answer as to what is going on with my health. So, I need some good advice. Here is the run down of what has been occurring:About two years ago I started having heavy night sweats about 3-4 times a week. I have to change my clothes 3 times a night at times. I sleep with a fan, very light clothing, and a very light blanket.About a year ago I noticed that I was using the bathroom alot to urinate but only in the last week did I find out through doing intake and output measurement that I am having an output of about 3500mls-4000mls a day when I only drink like 2500-2800mls a day. My doctor asked me to do this intake/output measurement.I have noticed since September that I have grown very tired and have a decreased amount of energy. I still pushed myself to go to work (I am an RN).About a month ago I had a episode where I was vomiting every hour for twelve hours straight. My husband also threw up a couple of times. I also had extreme pain throughout my body especially in my lower back. I ended up staying two nights in the hospital where they took my appendix out even though it wasn't inflamed. However, it was adhered to my abdomen. They did say that I had free fluid in my abdomen from an unknown source which they believe is what caused my pain.Since the surgery my fatigue has worsened two-fold, I have developed palpitations, SOB with little exertion (such as brushing my teeth), chest tightness and SOB just when going from a standing to squatting position, dizziness, randmon leg and arm aches, leg weakness (feels like legs buckle sometimes), sharp random pains behind calf and thigh,\u00a0\u00a0random tingling in my toes and fingers, dull headaches everyday, right eye lid droop, random moments of jumbled words or difficulty finding a word, orthostatic hypotension, HR that on average increases from 70bpm when lying to 115-120 within less than a minute upon standing. Yesterday I had a occurence of ringing in my ears after I felt a pressure release in my ear. The other morning for ten minutes my left side hurt everytime I took a breath.Recently (the last three days) my orthostatic hypotension seems to be better however the HR is increasing the same and the diastolic is coming over 90 when I go from a lying to standing position.Last couple of days my BP has been 102/90, 98/90, 119/93...My systolic drops as I stand and my diastolic rises greatly.All of my blood tests have come back negative (CBC, BMP, Cortisol, Aldosterone/renin, liver enzymes...), my CT scan was normal, my EKG is normal, my EEG is normal. I am still waiting on results from my ECHO, ultra sound of the kidneys, and 24hr urine test. I am scheduled to have a MRI soon.I have been out of work for a month. Before the surgery I was exercising three days a week, working three days a week, and I eat healthy. I don't smoke, drink, or use any kind of drug. I have cut back GREATLY on caffiene intake so as to try and rule that out as a cause for palpitations. Cutting back has not yet helped it though. I am a 23 year old female with a good health history. All of my immediate family members are healthy.I have been taking Synthroid for about 2 1/2 years now for mild hypothyroid.Sorry for this long message. Any thoughts?",
