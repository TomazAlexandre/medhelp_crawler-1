            "answer": "Hello rbk37,We're volunteers here and not medical professionals, so be certain to talk to your daughter's pediatrician about her headaches and the patterns she's noticed.Headaches can be caused by so many things including lack of sleep, dehydration, food allergies, stress, emotions, etc ... so asking your daughter to jot down what's happening (or not happening) when her headaches appear will help her, you & her doctor figure out what's happening.Blood sugar swings can also be associated with headaches, whether low or high.\u00a0\u00a0If your family has a history of Type 2 diabetes (often associated with obesity), it'll be very important to help your daughter develop good eating and exercise habits.Good luck. I hope this turns out to be something simple to work through.",

            "answer": "I had a few questions about Headaches and taking Oxycontin.\u00a0\u00a0My ex-husband just checked into the Diamond Headache Clinic and I was wondering how long it will take to get him off of this medication.\u00a0\u00a0What if he is not honest about his dosage amount?\u00a0\u00a0Will they be able to tell if he he isn't telling them the truth?Also, can Oxycodon (usage after taking for 5 years and being at a dosage that is 4-5 pills a day) affect your judgement and personality?\u00a0\u00a0What are additional ong term affects?\u00a0\u00a0I feel like it definitely affected many aspects of my ex-husbands behavior, but just don't have anything to compare this to. I feel that all of his perscriptions use was a big reason why I finally decided to file for divorce, but it's almost a \"closet\" discussion that people don't have, so I don't know what kinds of long term affects this drug has on people or how to find out answers to my questions.\u00a0\u00a0I've never posted a question on any forum and I'm really not very computer savy, but if anyone can give me any feedback I would greatly appreciate it!",
