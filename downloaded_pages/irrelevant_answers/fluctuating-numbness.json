            "answer": "I have so many of the same symptoms! UGH. So frustrating! I had an MMR vaccine right before my left leg and left side of face went numb. Have you had any vaccines lately? It made me think of that for you because your nurse said it may be a virus.",

    "question": "Male, 45, very good health, 6\u20191\u201d 185 lbs.For 7 weeks, I have been experiencing fluctuating numbness that varies in location - my left leg and foot, pinching/burning palms of both hands, pins/needles both hands and feet. Numbness in my tongue and lower front teeth, and left tear duct pins/needles\u00a0\u00a0On occasion, I\u2019ll get a short bout of hoarseness. All short-lived and will vary in location each day. It seems to be related to pressure on my left lower back just to the left of the tail bone area. I rarely have any numbness when walking/standing. I use a treadmill with no issue. The numbness occurs when sitting/lying down. I can get into sitting/lying positions that stop the numbness. I can create it by returning to certain positions. This leads me to believe some kind of pinched nerve, etc.I first had trouble with my left leg. I could not stand on it for 30 secs., it felt like it was asleep. After the 2nd instance in an 18 hour period, I went to the ER - thinking stroke.\u00a0\u00a0CT, Chest X-ray, EKG, blood, etc. All looked normal. My Gen. Dr. ordered an Ultrasound of the Carotid Arteries and MRI of the Brain. He checked my throat for the hoarseness. All tests looked good.Saw a Neurologist - full exam. Ordered MRIs of my upper/lower spine and an echocardiogram. Blood tests for B12, Folate, Sedimentation Rate Westergren, Lyme Ab Screen, thyroid, ANA, Thrombosis panel. All tests\u00a0\u00a0were \"un-remarkable\u201d. She thought it is a virus that will run its course.I look great on paper. No loss of strength - but very annoying and frustrating as it seems to be related to pressure on my pelvis/hip area. I am posting here to get any advice on next steps.",
