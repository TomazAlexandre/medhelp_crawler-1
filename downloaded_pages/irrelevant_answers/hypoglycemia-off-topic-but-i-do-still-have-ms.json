            "answer": "It seems like last time we talked about this I asked about your blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, your episodes do sound like hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0Some docs believe that this is a precursor to diabetes and some believe that it is an entity unto itself.If you immediately feel better after eating something, then it is likely that your blood sugar was low.The worst triggers of these episodes are foods that cause a big spike in insulin production.\u00a0\u00a0The reason for this is that some foods, like sugary things, cause rapid rise of the blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0In the normal person this cause the body to secrete a burst of insulin to bring the blood sugar down by making it available to the cells as fuel.\u00a0\u00a0This is the main role of insulin.\u00a0\u00a0In the person with hypoglycemic tendencies the production of insulin overshoots its goal and brings the sugar down too fast, bringing it too low and for too long.\u00a0\u00a0This causes the shakiness, confusion, sweating, rapid heart beat, headache, weakness, fainting or severe, overpowering sleepiness.It is this process of bringing the sugar down that led to the development of the glycemic scale.\u00a0\u00a0All carbohydrates stimulate the production of insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Sugar does it the most and fastest and fiber does it the least (well, actually not at all).\u00a0\u00a0They have studied standard servings of hundreds of food and seen which cause the sugar to go highest the fastest.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, sugar is at the top of the list.But, there are two surprises.\u00a0\u00a0There are two foods that are right up there with sugar.\u00a0\u00a0The first is breakfast cereal.\u00a0\u00a0The second is baked potatoes.People with hypoglycemic tendencies will often have a \"crash\" about three hours after a carb-high breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0They may also find that something like a milkshake can cause what my household calls \"sugar coma.\" - that deep unavoidable nap wher you sleep like the dead.To diagnose reactive hypoglycemia, the gold stand is the 5-hour Glucose Tolerance Test.\u00a0\u00a0Typically GTTs only go three hours.\u00a0\u00a0But, this will often miss the deep trough of low blood sugar in the hypoglycemic.Rena - the best way to see if this is a problem is to go on a lower glycemic diet.\u00a0\u00a0Avoid sugar and processed grains and have some protein, especially at breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0Avoid all cereals except complete whole grain ones like regular oatmeal.\u00a0\u00a0Do not eat sugar on it.Also it would be great to check your blood sugar early in such an attack.\u00a0\u00a0Later in the attack, the body puts out adrenaline to save itself and this will pump the blood sugar up some.Well, more than you wanted to know, but a pet epic discourse of mine.\u00a0\u00a0:))Quix",

I studied the diet book for hours that night and decided to start it the next day.\u00a0\u00a0 Hahh!!\u00a0\u00a0I didn't even make it through the day. As soon as I got off work, I drove (although I'm not sure how, as I was trying to black out) to the KFC across the road from our school and ordered a LARGE Pop (don't remember...not the point)!!\u00a0\u00a0I had to pull over & park, to drink it, as I was still about to pass out.\u00a0\u00a0I don't even remember doing alot of this part, just know that I did it afterwards...as I had that KFC cup in my truck.\u00a0\u00a0LOL!!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anyways, that really woke me up to watching what & how I eat...especially DIETS!!!\u00a0\u00a0 The only diet I'm striving to achieve at this point in life (& until I die), is to get back to the most ALL NATURAL, ORGANIC......CHEMICAL & HORMONE FREE FOOD that I can get!!!\u00a0\u00a0 I firmly believe that the rise in diseases, including MS, Fibro, Diabetes, etc...is due to the unphathomable amount of chemicals, hormones, & radiation we're constantly being exposed to.\u00a0\u00a0 Just my thoughts!\u00a0\u00a0;)Normally, I ALWAYS (and have since I was a teenager) carry a mug of some sort of drink throughout the day....for 2 reasons.\u00a0\u00a01) I have chronic dry mouth/throat/eyes...2) my blood sugar seems to drop fairly quickly.\u00a0\u00a0Whenever I start feeling faint, I drink some of my sweet tea, juice (or other?) to quickly 'pick me back up.'\u00a0\u00a0QUIX I never knew that about the \"food spikes.\"\u00a0\u00a0I remember my doctor talking some about sugars and foods to my mother, but I was only about 10 or 11 yrs old at that time, and don't remember much.\u00a0\u00a0Mom never talked about it to me much when I was growing up...she just knew what I needed, when I needed it.\u00a0\u00a0She died 2 weeks after my 18th birthday, (& I miss my best friend so much\u00a0\u00a0:(\u00a0\u00a0..), so I can't ask her any of the \"desperate questions\" that I have about my health.\u00a0\u00a0My closest Grandma (mom's mom) has passed, & I've lost contact with my \"biological portaguese father & grandmother.\"\u00a0\u00a0It's too bad too, because I knew that my \"portaguese Grandmother\" was always sick and was in bad health.\u00a0\u00a0I can't remember now, what it was that she said she had...as it could be helpful in my diagnosis, since so many things are hereditary.BTW QUIX, you posted the symptoms of hypoglycemia, PRECISELY!!...& unfortunetly, I know the \"sugar soma\" all too well!!\u00a0\u00a0Also, if I ever allow a spell to linger too long without food/drink, then I'm severely sick & worthless for the rest of the day...constant nausea, distortion, confusion, racing heart, MIGRAINE, EXHAUSTED,...walking around in a daze!...etc...doesn't matter when I FINALLY get to eat...if I've reached that \"point of no return\"...then it's just over for me that day!!!\u00a0\u00a0So, I try to carry around pieces of candy/snacks in my purse/car for emergencies...in addition to my big mug of course!!\u00a0\u00a0;)RENA, feel free to PM me anytime hon, if you have questions.\u00a0\u00a0Believe me!...I know exactly what you're going through...and it CAN be scary, so don't hesitate to ask. ;)~tj",

            "answer": "Thanks.I think you are saying that you now know that by carrying around candy and snacks you are perpetuating the episodes of hypogycemia.\u00a0\u00a0For everyone reading, using candy causes the blood sugar to be on a continuous rollercoaster of highs and EXTREME lows.\u00a0\u00a0This is all because of the way they induce the production of insulin.\u00a0\u00a0 Tj said it well - food spikes.\u00a0\u00a0Much better to eat 6 or more small meals a day, each to include a little protein and ONLY lower-glycemic carbohydrates.\u00a0\u00a0The protein acts to ease the peaks of the blood sugar highs and lows.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not talking Atkins here (though that is MY preferred diet).\u00a0\u00a0Just check out the glycemic scale and eat the lower carbs plus high grade proteins and healthy fats.\u00a0\u00a0Organic and natural are great, but remember that there are some pretty sugary natural foods.\u00a0\u00a0Treat those as possible enemies until you have \"cleaned up\" and cautiously tried them again.My dad was a severe hypoglycemic for years, lost his job, went on disability and was (mis)diagnosed as schizophrenic.\u00a0\u00a0He couldn't work, couldn't make decisions and was irritable.\u00a0\u00a0An endocrinologist properly diagnosed him, placed him on the above rules and he returned to his prior brilliant self.\u00a0\u00a0His blood glucose was hanging around 40 to 50.You HAVE to stop the sugar!\u00a0\u00a0The withdrawal can be holy h@ll for about three days.\u00a0\u00a0During the time that you are withdrawing from the sugar, eat all you need of proteins and totally whole grains.\u00a0\u00a0Then you can back off once the withdrawal of feeling wretched is over.\u00a0\u00a0The result can be astounding.\u00a0\u00a0This is hard science people - not fad - not supposition.\u00a0\u00a0Initially I would have everyone (hypoglycemics) also be off of white flour, pasta and potatoes, and easy on fruit which also can trigger a too-sensitive pancreas.\u00a0\u00a0Once the blood sugar is stabilized (a week or so) you add in the more high-glycemic\u00a0\u00a0carbs (whole grains are better) and fruit slowly and see how they affect you.Some severe hypoglycemics have to be very careful even with fruit.Great snacks are nuts, cheese, a bit of chicken breast, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Just stay away from the sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I am speaking to those with the reactions to sugar that we are speaking about.\u00a0\u00a0It's a great way to eat anyway, but I am not preaching diet here.\u00a0\u00a0Diet is as dangerous as politics and religion, lol.Tj - Are we on the same page?\u00a0\u00a0Rena?Momma Quix",

            "answer": "Rena, I want you to do a search on The Glycemic Index and give yourself a little education.\u00a0\u00a0The Index lists foods in the order that they cause your blood sugar to go up the fastest.\u00a0\u00a0At the top are sugar and processed flour.\u00a0\u00a0As you go down you get into the more natural, less processed food, vegetables and fiber foods.\u00a0\u00a0For hypoglycemics, you need to understand this concept.What is a carbohydrate?There are three categories of food in the world.\u00a0\u00a0These are carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.A carbohydrate is derived from plants.\u00a0\u00a0They are based on the element carbon (carbo) and water (hydrate= hydrogen and oxygen).\u00a0\u00a0When you look on a package's nutritional information you see how many grams of fats of different kinds, grams of protein and grams of carbohydrate are in that food.\u00a0\u00a0They determine the number of grams of carb in a type of food by burning it and assaying how much carbon is left and how much water is released.The simplest form of carbohydrate is sugar, but processed flour and other grains are close to it.\u00a0\u00a0When you eat the body turns all carbohydrates into blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Sugar is the same as glucose in the blood.\u00a0\u00a0Actually glucose in the simplest form of sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Other sugars are a tiny bit more complicated like fructose, lactose, etc.\u00a0\u00a0When you see a chemical with the ending of -ose on it you are dealing with a form of sugar.In the pancreas is an area that monitors the blood glucose level.\u00a0\u00a0 When a sugar load is eaten the pancreas releases insulin to deal with it by delivering it to the individual cells of the body to use as fuel.\u00a0\u00a0If there is more glucose hanging around than is needed by the cells the insulin does it's secondary job, helping to transform the sugar into fat for storage in case there is a shortage later.\u00a0\u00a0If you consistently eat more than the body needs at the time you start getting fat.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, insulin.Not all carbohydrates affect insulin equally.\u00a0\u00a0Sugar and other readily absorbable carbs cause an immediate spike in insulin.\u00a0\u00a0As I said above, in hypoglycemics, the insulin mechanism overreacts and too much is released.\u00a0\u00a0The blood sugar falls too low, too fast and stays there too long.\u00a0\u00a0This causes the hypoglycemic reaction as the body goes into a stressed mode.\u00a0\u00a0Cells of the body need a steady supply of blood glucose, especially the brain.\u00a0\u00a0When it is too low all h*ll breaks loose and you get the symptoms we have been talking about.Most people discover that they can stop a reaction very early by using sugar.\u00a0\u00a0The problem is that this perpetuates the exagerated rise and fall of the blood sugar and keeps the vicious cycle going.Why not use sugar?\u00a0\u00a0Afterall, diabetics are told to eat a pice of candy or drink a glass of orange juice when their sugar gets too low.\u00a0\u00a0There is a BIG difference.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetics don't have a proper insulin mechanism.\u00a0\u00a0Either they don't produce enough insulin (Type I) or their bodies are resistant to the action of the insulin they do mak (Type II).\u00a0\u00a0So what works for a diabetic can a hypoglycemic more sick.The goal, when you have hypoglycemia is to keep the blood sugar stable and avoid the spikes which result in the dangerous and miserable lows.The solution is to eat more frequently and include other foods than sugar and processed grains that do not cause bigtime production of insulin.\u00a0\u00a0This is where the Glycemic Index comes in. (also called the Glycemic Scale or Ladder).\u00a0\u00a0The first thing you do is eject the sugar and other high glycemic foods from your diet.\u00a0\u00a0This is things like white bread, pasta, pizza crust, bakery goods, rolls, ---- and such.\u00a0\u00a0Replace those with lower glycemic carbs, proteins and a little more healthy fats.\u00a0\u00a0These are converted to blood glucose slower and do not affect the insulin production as much.\u00a0\u00a0The carbohydrates you want are those that are more complex.Complex carbohydrates (often called starches) are like those in whole grains - realizing that these are still higher on the scale than others, legumes (beans, lentils, etc), tomatoes, onions, squash, and other vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0Only whole grain rice with bran is lower on the scale.\u00a0\u00a0Porcessed white rice is still a readily absorbed carbohydrate.\u00a0\u00a0Whole brown rice is much lower.\u00a0\u00a0Things with fiber are are often great choices.\u00a0\u00a0Fiber is a carbohydrate that is not absorbed and is passed in the stool retty much unchanged.\u00a0\u00a0Think of it this way.\u00a0\u00a0A pinecone is a plant.\u00a0\u00a0It is also a carbohydrate and pure fiber.\u00a0\u00a0If you eat a pinecone you will poop a pinecone.\u00a0\u00a0:((Fruit - always the perfect food, yes?\u00a0\u00a0Not necessarily.\u00a0\u00a0If you are a hypoglycemic even fruit can do you dirt, especially if you have uncontrolled hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0The fruits that are lowest on the glycemic scale are the berries - blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries.\u00a0\u00a0Some fruits are pure sugar and are fruits by definition of the way they grow and not by how healthy they are.\u00a0\u00a0Some fruits are pure sugar and are fruits by definition of the way they grow and not by how healthy they are.\u00a0\u00a0(I repeated that for emphasis, because not all things that are natural are healthy for everyone).After stabilizing their blood sugars for a while, many hypoglycemics will be able to add in most real foods (not sugar or processed grains).\u00a0\u00a0The length of time need to return their insulin production toward normal varies from weeks to months or years.\u00a0\u00a0A severe hypoglycemic may be controllable with diet, but may never be able to enjoy sugars without paying a price.\u00a0\u00a0My dad is one of the severe ones.\u00a0\u00a0If he goes on a toot of eating candy and pastries, he slowly gets foggy and unclear in the head, and starts sleeping every day away.What I have seen is that when a hypoglycemic gets clear of the sugar/poison they feel soooo much better that they aren't as tempted by the processed carbohydrates again.What to do about the inevitable crashes, especially early in the process when your insulin production is still way out of control?\u00a0\u00a0A bite (one) of candy is okay, but also eat something lower on the glycemic scale to give you a longer, more drawn out rise in your blood sugar - like a handful of berries and an ounce of cheese, some nuts, or a piece of meatThe crashes can almost be completely eliminated by eating 6 little meals a day - each containing some protein and a low glycemic carb - whole grains or vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0Don't forget healthy fats.During the first week, but especially the first three days, you may have a horrible craving for sweets.\u00a0\u00a0If the snacks don't take care of it, then choose a fruit that is low on the scale or several whole-grain crackers like Triscuit or SunCrisps, or some apple.Hypoglycemia is dangerous in that you could faint while driving or climbing stairs.\u00a0\u00a0Our brains are diseased enough without depriving them of their needed fuel, even for an hour.\u00a0\u00a0You will feel better.\u00a0\u00a0Rena, you will feel less confused, lol.Go look at some sites dedicated to the glycemic scale and or a low-glycemic diet.\u00a0\u00a0It will all begin to make sense to you.\u00a0\u00a0The ultimate goal is to stop pumping out insulin like you were trying to put out a fire.\u00a0\u00a0A side benefit for many eating this way is losing weight.Whew!Quix",

I'm already thin, i can't loose anymore weight but I go through the day on a vicious cycle of up and down on sugar crashes. i'm used to this but i know it's not good, i eat 5-6 small meals a day and juice, candy, fruit bars and anything inbetween if i start to lose it.example: breakfast was rice chex and two cookies, and lunch was chicken, pasta and peas and sweet tea. I'll have to eat soon again, or drink Ensure..Please, what do I do? I've tried to read everything you wrote here. It makes snse but it all bounced around in my head. If I were to get off of sugar completely how would i control it? i hope this makes any sense.~Sunnytoday~",

            "answer": "ST, the point Quix is making with the hypoglycemic's\u00a0\u00a0use of sugar is it puts your insulin production on a roller coaster and never gives your body a chance to equalize at a normal spot.\u00a0\u00a0You want to eat the foods that don't cause these glucose levels spike - either high or low.\u00a0\u00a0My mom bounces all over with her glucose - 35 to 140 in a day's time often.\u00a0\u00a0Once you find the diet that your body reacts to you will feel so much healthier.\u00a0\u00a0Some of it is so simple but other parts are complex and you have to make a concerted effort to understand it before you can eat right to solve the problem.you're sweet enough,Lulu",

Perhaps a nutrionist would be the thing to go to try to get a balance between my gastropareis, IBS, allergies, and blood sugar problems. So far my way has been eat sugar to keep around 100 pounds and if i get to feeling like i'm goin to pass out so i drink juice or eat candy. Reading this post helped me understand that i need to even it out if at all possible. Not sure how i'm going to yet though, i'll ask mom to read this and hlep me apply it to me.i'm glad you think i'm sweet enough.",

            "answer": "Hi there, I have a great cookbook that explains the glycemic index, lists foods and their glycemic index rating; they call it the G-Force.The cookbook is The Healthiest Diet In The World by Nikkin & David Goldbeck.\u00a0\u00a0I found it on clearance, so you may be able to find a copy of it online at a low price.\u00a0\u00a0I've enjoyed a lot of the recipes, and have learned a lot from all the informative pages it contains.One thing that brought it to mind was your mention of artificial sweeteners.\u00a0\u00a0Quix can probably tell us if there is any scientific research to back this up, but let me copy down something that this cookbook says about them:\"Artificial sweeteners, including saccharine, cyclamates, and aspartame, don't turn into glucose and therefore don't raise blood sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0Because of this many people assume they can only help with weight control.If you look back on our discussion .... you may perceive how these sweeteners could actually stimulate weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0Remember, when the brain anticipates food, and sweet food in particular, it sends out signals that arouse insulan even before glucose gets to the bloodstreamSince the brain can't detect the absence of calories, insulin is released even if there is no work for it to do (i.e., there is no glucose released for it to escort into the cells).\u00a0\u00a0As long as this uncalled-for insulin remains in circulation, the effectos of hyperinsulinemia, including fat storage and retention, are set in motion.Moreover, this unsatisfied expectation of calories may manipulate the brain in a way that stimulates hunger.\u00a0\u00a0This effect has been demonstrated in experiments on animals\".Of course, this book was published in 1998, so I'm sure a lot more research has been done since then.Since I had my tummy troubles, I've found it difficult to eat breakfast and sometimes lunch.\u00a0\u00a0I have found that I feel better if I do eat, even if my tummy bloats a little.My favorite breakfasts are a slice of toast with fresh-ground almond butter (no sugar or weird fats added), or a bowl of Natures Path organic pumpkin flaxseed granola with unsweetened almond milk on it.\u00a0\u00a0Oh, or home-cooked old-fashioned oats with some natural no-sugar added applesauce mixed in.When looking for low glycemic foods, such as whole grain bread, look for whole wheat flour as the first ingredient.\u00a0\u00a0Avoid anything with high fructose corn syrup.\u00a0\u00a0A lot of bread includes sugar of some sort; choose one that lists it way down on the list of ingredients, and is something like honey,.molasses, or plain sugar.\u00a0\u00a0They all do the same dance with the blood sugar, but at least honey and molasses have traces of nutrients and are often less processed than other sweeteners.When I consume things with some sweetener in them, I try to balance it with fiber and protein, to slow the jolt of sugar into my bloodstream.Funny, I don't have hypoglycemia or any sign of diabetes; I just started eating this way to improve my health.When my tummy acted up, I had to eat white bread, rice, bananas, and applesauce, which just about drove me crazy.\u00a0\u00a0What I'm saying is that when you get through changing your eating habits, it feels like the normal and desired way to eat.Not to say I don't want a big cookie now and then; I try to select one with oats and walnuts,\u00a0\u00a0going for the healthiest of the bunch.When you think of whole grains, think of things like barley; it not only has a low glycemic index, it can also increase your feeling of fullness.\u00a0\u00a0I make a really yummy chicken veggie barley soup; let me know if you would like the recipe.I want you feeling well and happy, my friend.\u00a0\u00a0Take good care of you, and accept a hug from someone down here in the balmy 50 degree rain.Many hugs,Kathy",
