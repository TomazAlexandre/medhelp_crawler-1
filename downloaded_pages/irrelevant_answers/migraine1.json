(Just curious based on some of your symptoms).I know...tons of questions....I'm a migraine-sufferer also....have been for the past 15+ years and it does suck, no nice way to put it.",

            "answer": "Have you been tested for diabetes beyond the one time you had your blood glucose levels tested (and was this a fasting or non-fasting specimen)? Joint problems are a hallmark of this disease. I also get migraines and have joint problems (and I'm only 22).....but my thyroid has been going crazy for the past year, so you might want to have a thyroid panel done next time you get bloodwork done. Are you on any medication for your migraines? I would definitely consider trying to quit smoking, namely because this could be a cause of your migraines.",

My left eyeball feels like it is terribly strained. there is also a tingling/numbing sensation in the left side of the body including the jaw.I feel totally drained out and am not able to focus at all. I have stopped feeling fresh anymore and always feel like i am stressed out.This headache occurs almost everyday and might last at times for 6-8 hours at a stretch. I also have irritable bowel syndrome and a pain in all my joints of the body especially shoulder and knees.I have got an MRI done of the brain and it was normal.There is a family history of diabetics with my grandfather having it at the age of 34(died at 64).lastly i smoke around a pack a day.please give me a cure if you can.thanks",
