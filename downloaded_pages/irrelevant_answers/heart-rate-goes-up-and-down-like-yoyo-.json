            "answer": "Hello,Depending on your age or conditioning, there is an effect called Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia. Years ago, my dog was laying on the floor, and I had my hand on his side. His heart rate was going faster and slower. After observing, I realized his heart rate fluctuated with his breathing. I already was familiar with the term Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia and was unconcerned.As we breathe in, our heart should increase in rate, as we breathe out, it should slow. It's most pronounced in children and adolescents and, I believe, may occur in conditioned adults as well.Experiment with your monitor, take moderately deep breaths in, slowly, and watch the rate. Then slowly breath out and watch the rate.",
