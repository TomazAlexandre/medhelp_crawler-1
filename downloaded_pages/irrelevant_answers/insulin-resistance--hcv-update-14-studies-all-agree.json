            "answer": "it MAY lose some effect, or, as I suspect, the VEVR that some get immediately lowers the IR.meaning basically absent the hcv virus the insulin level corrects itself. Insulin resistance occurs because our natural interfeon cancels out insulin, requiring more to be produced. The cells then become awash in all the extra insulin the body must produce, and the insulin resistance commences...however, at treatments inception even a 10-20 increase in fasting insulin is linked to drops in rates of SVR.here is a good primer to get folks started if they wish to increase their chances.http://www.medhelp.org/user_journals/show/68011/What-you-Need-to-Know-About-Insulin-Resistance-to-Increase-SVR?personal_page_id=450mb",

            "answer": "opps almost forgot...the other issue is once you start treating you are going to have high Interferon no matter what...therefore your pancreas with work harder, and regulation will be more difficult. The trend toward higher blood sugars in the treatment enviornment is therefore of concern as long as the INF level is being artificially raised.The cells themselves may begin to fair better for a variety of reasons unrelated directly to the insulin however, chiefly because metabolism is far more complex than simply insulin resistance.It's also been show that pituitary function increases absent the virus which also increases cell response, and obviously lowering liver enzymes and hence cell death and waste products all improve cell health...however those metabolic gains can be offset by other unfortunate events in tx....such as thyroid dysfunctions, or full blown type 1 diebetes, also possible outcomes of the tx regime.The real truth is that every patient should be monitored by an endocrinologist to help avoid all the pitfalls, just my opinion.mb",

The median time from treatment to onset was slightly more than half a year, suggesting rapid beta-cell destruction. Onset was significantly faster in patients on pegylated interferon and ribavirin than in those on nonpegylated interferon monotherapy, according to a July 20th online paper in Diabetes Care.Ninety-five percent of patients had anti-islet autoantibodies when their type 1 diabetes was diagnosed.The authors say stronger antiviral treatments may contribute to patients' risk of autoimmune diabetes. They note that pegylation extends the half-life of interferon and ribavirin may alter the immune response.Genetic susceptibility also plays a role.\"Type 1 diabetes susceptibility HLA-DRs in the Japanese population, DR4 and DR9, were also associated with interferon treatment-related type 1 diabetes,\" the authors say.The HLA-DR13 allele was present in 15.4% of interferon-related type 1 diabetics but only in 7.8% of classical type 1 diabetic patients, a significant difference. The frequency of HLA-DR14 was also significantly higher.SOURCE: http://bit.ly/nyPlbIDiabetes Care 2011.",

            "answer": "as best I can tell there is no controversy over the fact that in-range BMI can play a role in improving SVR odds and that a good diet and exercise always\u00a0\u00a0make sense, whether pre, during or post tx. Nor about the existence of a dangerous connection between diabetes and accelerated fibrosis progression. Nor about the fact that monitoring\u00a0\u00a0blood sugar levels should be part of routine health checks.However failure to incorporate the HOMA IR scale into clinical practice seems well justified: as an index it's simply not reliable. The HOMA-1 scale originally proposed by Matthews in '85 was replaced by a recalibrated model in\u00a0\u00a0'98 (HOMA-2) which improved acknowledged deficiencies in the original model. HOMA1 and HOMA2 scores calculated\u00a0\u00a0from the same patient glucose/insulin data can be quite different. Seehttp://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homacalculator/index.phpNotwithstanding the shortcomings of HOMA1, all research has continued to use it because it is expressed as a simple formula whereas HOMA2 requires more elaborate interpolation buried inside the software binary distributed by the authors rather than as a published algorithm.More importantly, unlike say BMI, there are no clear guidelines for\u00a0\u00a0the expected distribution of values among healthy subjects :\u00a0\u00a0how do you know there's a problem?One can't do science without reliable measurement and the HOMA-1 IR index isn't much to build on. This of course doesn't mean the underlying issues aren't real, only that the yardstick is not reliable.",

            "answer": "sorry to be so long in answering, been gone most of the summer...aaron,it could be either type diebetes, the tx can cause either and or both, says so right in the literature and warnings.IR, type 2 occurs when the body is awash in too much insulin, caused by higher interferon, which uses up the insulin forcing the body to make more, and the cells finally shut down and become resistant to protect themselves, which then backfires and harms them,Or type 1,when the organ itself shuts down and can't make the insulin as a result of all this overwork or an autoimmune attack.either evene tis possible, it is also possible to have BOTH type 1 and type 2 diebetes simutaneously, regardless of whether you are treating or not.Willing,I'm not sure which is the more accurate so don't wish to speak out of turn here, but it does bear repeating that at least during treatment the HOMA is more reliable. WHY?The A1C is reliant on the red blood count, and since that is thrown off entirely by the chemo, A!C is not a reliable diagnostic during the chemo.One can't loose 1/3 of their red blood cells, like I did, and then not expect a test relying on RBC to be accuracte. The proof was that I was normal on A1C and highly IR on the HOMA at the same time.All that really proves is that something was askew...but how many times around the elephant before someone figures out it's an elephant? That's for bigger minds than mine,As to which is better outside the treatment landscape, I'm sure there is sound reasoning on both sides of the pond, and I'd be hard pressed to say which group knows more.\u00a0\u00a0Bet ya in about another hundred years they'll figure it out!!\u00a0\u00a0: )\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, pass the stevia...: )",
