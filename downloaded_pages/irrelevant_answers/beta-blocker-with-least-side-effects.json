I do not have a very severe condition, and I find that a little bit of TOPROL XL goes a long way without producing much of a side effect.\u00a0\u00a0I take much less than the standard minimum dose however.",

            "answer": "Thanks to both for repliesBromley, How low of a dose are you on? Do you split a pill? And does it help with anxiety? when I get the tachycardia I get very anxious... kind of vicious circle. I am currently on flecanide but my PCP wants the cardio to change it because of side effects. It helps, but does not control my heart rate.ffmedic 11,Sectral, never heard of that one. Does it control your rate without lowering BP to much. And how about the anxiety issue.. although when my heart rate is under control I don't have a problem with feeling anxious. Its just when my heart \"gets wild\" and I can't get the rate down fast.Does being on beta blockers increase your chances of type 2 diabetes?? I have a HUGE family hx of diabetes.Thanks all!!!",

Maybe you would like to read it. Also, are you being treated for your thyroid problem? Malfunction of the thyroid always compromises the heart...",

            "answer": "Hi, I had PSVT , have a normally low BP and was taking 25mg of metoprolol 2X day. When I first started it, it caused me to be photosensitive, which I found out on a trip to the tropics and had to hide from the sun!...It also made me very fatigued, lethargicand unable to focus. Others have no problem with that dose. I don't take meds usually,and am a lightweight, everyone has different metabolism, physical make up, so you will have to find what works for you. In my case, I started out with very infrequent SVT episodes, then they became more frequent, then with syncope, so I wonder if the metoprolol was ever even working for me. My EP at that time suggested flecainide or an ablation. I chose the latter.Be aware of what triggers you have, staying hydrated is a key one for me. I also was taking all the usual heart supplements...Best wishes",

            "answer": "I started with arrythmia problems at the age of 26. I'll be 47 in a few weeks. I have always taken tenormin. 2 years ago I got diagnosed hypthyroid. What brought about the testing is my tachycardia got worse and \"different\". So I now take levothyroxine for the thyroid. Just had blood done and got my results today. Thyroid is 2.48. But! The \"different\" tachycardia continued after I was diagnosed hypo and on the levo. After many visits to reg doc and cardio and tests, etc. I found out on my own that just being hypo AND on a betablocker means a dosage adjustment needed. So my tenormin dose was doubled and things are much better. The \"different\" tachycardia was PAC's thrown into the mix. About a year ago my cardio decided it was time I get off my old betablocker and try Toprol. It was a huge disaster! Only took it for one day it was quite a horrible day at that. I had horrible PAC's from any and all movement I made so I had to lay in bed allllllll day and not move and went back on the tenormin the next day and I'm staying put with that.Chattychicky",

I was on 240 mg of verapamil and my BP was 80/50 at times and I was SO tired. I will keep this info for future.Right now Cardio gave me 25 mg of Toprol to try..Chattychicky, you got me really scared. I hope you were on a much higher dose. I am going\u00a0\u00a0to score the pill and take 12.5 to start... we shall see. Cardio did say he thinks I will NOT like it but said give it a try. He thinks I will feel to fatigued on 25 mg... so pharmacist suggested trying half- as you do Bromley!!!If not I can go back to flecainide, it works fairly well, just have a dull, low headache alot...and I don't usually get headaches. And my PCP thought it was to serious a drug for my issue.. but cardio lsaid I could stick with that if I want.As for anxiety, when my heart is under control I usually don't have an anxiety issue.. just get it when I have an \"PSVT attack\", or\u00a0\u00a0run of real bad palps which won't stop for some time.Thanks for all your help... will keep you posted!!!",
