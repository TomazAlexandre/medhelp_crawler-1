            "answer": "Different meters have different settings, so check in your manual, but \"Hi\" generally refers to extremely high blood sugars in the 300-500 range. You need to get that number down by safely doing correction boluses based on your correction factor (how many points one unit brings you down), taking into account any fast-acting insulin on board. Drinking a lot of water also helps when you are very high. If you have these high blood sugars ongoing for awhile you are at risk of DKA so if you begin to feel flu-like symptoms or vomiting you need to go to the ER.By the way you've posted in the Type 2 forum.",

            "answer": "Additionally, I reviewed your online MH Diabetes Tracker Stats. I don't mean to sound harsh or make it sound as if I'm putting you down, but having extremely high average glucose readings of 516 mg/dl will lead to serious health issues. Also, having lows of 32 and maximums of 1000 mg/dl, or even swings from 32 to 516 wreaks havoc on your cardio system. This is way too dangerous to continue and must stop immediately.You're young 23 yo. If you wish to continue living a normal life you really need to see an Endocrinologist, get on proper medication, get diabetes educated and practice controlling and managing your diabetes.",

            "answer": "Wow, I hadn't checked the tracker. I absolutely agree with waverider. If you are seeing a regular doctor, get a referral to an endo. PCPs just don't have the knowledge or the time to manage type 1. Also get the book Using Insulin by John Walsh to learn how to better manage your insulin doses and match them to carbs to reduce highs and lows.",
