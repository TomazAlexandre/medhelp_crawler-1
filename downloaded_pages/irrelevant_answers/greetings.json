            "answer": "Glad to have you with us and I'd like to commend you on your 11.5 lb weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have diabetes either, but I have a son who's had type I diabetes since the age of 10, and HIS son was recently diagnosed with type 1, as well; in addition to that, I have a brother and 2 sisters with type II.I, personally, have hypothyroidism and Hashimoto's thyroiditis and pernicious anemia; I've been on blood pressure med for about 10 yrs, and my doctor recently added a second bp med....\u00a0\u00a0Most everyone on the forum is aware of the struggles I've had -- in fact, am still having, and I can most certainly identify with your feelings that doctors often just plain don't care about the patient -- it's all about herding as many people through the office in a day's time as they can.So -- you can see that we are well aware of the struggles that people with medical issues can have with weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0It's really easy for someone to tell us we have to lose weight -- that seems to be \"the magic cure\" for a lot of illnesses, but no one can tell us the \"magic secret\" to success.There are a lot of people on this forum who have lost many pounds -- I, personally, have probably lost around 50 altogether -- the problem is it's the same 5 pounds over and over................lolAnyway, there are as many different ways to losing weight successfully, as there are people who need to lose it.\u00a0\u00a0We can give you ideas, suggestions, friendship, support and all those other things that we need so badly during this difficult and often frustrating journey.........For starters, I might suggest that you begin implementing the food diary here on medhelp to track what you are eating.\u00a0\u00a0That will give you the number of calories you are eating/day so you can compare with what you SHOULD be eating.You don't say what you do for exercise, but some type of exercise is essential, along with the healthy eating.\u00a0\u00a0The two added together may even help with the mood swings, and other symptoms of menopause.I hope you will keep posting and let us get to know you a bit better and we can all work on this together............",

            "answer": "Welcome to the Weight Loss & Dieting Community; we're THRILLED YOU ARE HERE and as you can see, you are most welcome and there is much support from the members here.Barb is correct in encouraging you to implement the Food Diary and I will also suggest the Exercise Tracker.\u00a0\u00a0Those, combined with what you have stated above, will give you an accurate picture of where you are and where you are going.\u00a0\u00a0It will also provide a history of your journey and reports that can be printed and taken with you to your doctor.Personally, I began at 330 pounds and am now at 192.\u00a0\u00a0I have gone through menopause and have not really found it more difficult to lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0The key really is what goes in (what you eat) minus what you burn (use in daily activities and exercise) equals your weight.\u00a0\u00a0Now this can be more difficult if you have a disease, like Hashimoto's or on steroids, etc.\u00a0\u00a0But, as you can see, the lovely people above battle this and succeed.It takes a deficit of 3,500 calories to lose a pound.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, if you cut your calories by 250-500 and increase your current exercise to burn 250-500 calories, you can anticipate losing 1-2 pounds a week.\u00a0\u00a0This can end up being a little more in the beginning (like when I was 330 lbs) versus now (at 192).My suggestion is to make a list of foods you like to eat despite the calories.\u00a0\u00a0Then, we can help you find healthier ways to prepare them or substitutions for them that are healthier.\u00a0\u00a0Please do not think of this as a diet, but a lifestyle change.\u00a0\u00a0Diet indicates a beginning and an end .. and includes the word D-I-E.\u00a0\u00a0A lifestyle change are changes that we make that we can live with and incorporate into our lives to choose to live longer, healthier lives.Perhaps start with 3 small meals and 3 snacks.\u00a0\u00a0This keeps your metabolism working at maximum efficiency.\u00a0\u00a0Try exercising 3-5 times a week and change it up ... our bodies adapt quickly so we need to keep surprising it each day with something new to keep our bodies burning at a maximum level.Including lean meats, low-fat dairy, fresh/frozen fruits and vegetables, whole grain breads and pastas and natural oils (olive oil, the oil found in an avacado, a few pistachios or walnuts) is a good way to start choosing some healthy alternatives.As for sweeteners .. there are many takes on that.\u00a0\u00a0I personally use Splenda and eat chocolate in the form of Blue Bunny fudgesickles for 40 calories each.\u00a0\u00a0I don't deprive myself, I have just made better choices.\u00a0\u00a0Read labels .. it helps you choose.Please stay involved in the board, be active as it will help keep you motivated and you are a valued member of this group.Very best wishes and a warm, warm welcome.\u00a0\u00a0Many hugs ... and pat yourself on the back for what you've accomplished as well as for finding us here for support.\u00a0\u00a0It indicates your sincere desire to make some different choices and is quite an accomplishment.Know that WE BELIEVE IN YOU .. and look forward to your feedback.Love and Huggssss ..Ranae",

    "question": "Hello everyone!I am new here. I'm hoping I can find, friends, encouragement, and a little ray of hope.I was diagnosed about 2 1/2 years ago with High Blood Pressure & Type II Diabetes. I have gone to sooo many doctors since then and have developed \"white coat syndrome\". Some of these doctors just don't seem to care about my well-being. They just keep putting me on more medication and tell me to loose weight. They tell me to come back in 6 months and then they send me on my way.I'm here today because I am sick of struggling by myself. I signed up here because of the weight, food, and diabetes tracker. My weight was 188. Somehow I have managed to bring it down to 175.5 as of today. My short term goal is to get down to at least 140. My neice is getting married in May 2010, and I really would like to look & feel good for her big day.I also am starting menopause, so the weight lose is more of a struggle, along with the anxiety, mood swings and occasional hot flashes......I just want my happy-go-lucky self back. If somebody is willing to help me \"find myself\", I would be eternally grateful!.....lolHave a great day!Rondie",
