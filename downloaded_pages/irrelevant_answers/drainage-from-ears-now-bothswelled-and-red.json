            "answer": "Food allergies can cause swelling, even in the brain and head, which can cause ear infectons and sinus infections. In my family's case the food is any sort of dairy, and for me it's sugar substitues. I have a nephew who kept having ear infections, and was perscribed antibiotics each time. After a year or so the Dr figured out it was the same ear infection, and that it was viral, and he had to ride it out until it cleared on it's own. Both of these may or may not be your case. Hope you find your solution!",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.If there had been ear ache which has been relieved with the bleeding, then most probably it an otitis interna (inner ear infection) and it has ruptured the tympanic membrane. This is all the more significant as there has been discharge. The other common causes for the discharge are\u00a0\u00a0otitis externa or infections of the external ear.Have a culture and sensitivity test done to find out the correct antibiotic that the infecting organism is sensitive to and taking this medication for the required amount of days may help to clear infection. Am hoping Diabetes has been ruled out. Discuss these options with your doctor when you happen to meet him next time.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
