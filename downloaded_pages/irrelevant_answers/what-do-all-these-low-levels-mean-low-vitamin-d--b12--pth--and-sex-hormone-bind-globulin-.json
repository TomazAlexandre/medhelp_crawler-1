            "answer": "Bind Globulin SHBG, can be affected by high levels of insulin. Any family history of diabetes? This just means your body doesn't make enough SHBG to trigger the production of sex hormones as fast as most people.The low PTH can be responsible for low vitamin D. As your kidney needs PTH to make active vitamin D. Fix Hypothyroid, and fix the vitamin D problem.As far as Vitamin B12, you can take a vitamin B12 Complex Pill each morning, they will help you be less fatigued and tired if you are.",
