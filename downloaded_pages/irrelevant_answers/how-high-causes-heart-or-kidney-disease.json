(had never been that high before)\u00a0\u00a0The Advice Nurse I phoned insisted that I come to the Emergency Room where I was given 2 shots of Insulin to bring my level down.\u00a0\u00a0I was there for hours.My physician did not put me on Insulin but rather sent me to an Endroconologist who required that I begin taking Byetta. I believe that this med does not act like Insulin but it did take away the grand appetite which I suffered.\u00a0\u00a0I am now losing weight and my blood levels are pretty good on the whole.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately one can only take this med if you take a certain type of Pill medication (I believe there are only 3).I hope this helps with your question.\u00a0\u00a0I know that I am very satisfied with my results on this medication.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I have suffered Kidney problems ever since I was told that I was Diabetic years ago.\u00a0\u00a0This began when my blood levels were in the 100 - 115 range, so I believe that one must take the advice of your Physician AFTER you have had tests on your Kidneys.\u00a0\u00a0I am unsure, but I follow my Doctors advice as well as looking for information on the net.\u00a0\u00a0(WebMD is a good site)One last thing - only your doctor can tell you if you need the Pills or Insulin.\u00a0\u00a0It is always your choice whether or not you agree and choose to follow their advice.\u00a0\u00a0I had an Uncle who was also diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0When his Kidneys failed his doc wanted him to go on Dialysis, he refused.\u00a0\u00a0Later that year he passed, but then again he was already 95 years old.Good Luck and please keep us posted.\u00a0\u00a0Anita",
