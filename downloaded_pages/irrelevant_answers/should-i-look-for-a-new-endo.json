    "question": "Hello Everyone,This is my first time posting to this forum (though I have been lurking for awhile).Here's my situation:\u00a0\u00a0On June 4, my gynecologist found a nodule on my thyroid and referred me out for an ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0The ultrasound was performed on June 8, and confirmed that I have a 2.5 cm nodule on the right lobe of my thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0I was then referred out to an endocrinologist.Unfortunately, I am a grad student living in a college town, so it appears we have only one endocrinologist to whom the university health center refers out.\u00a0\u00a0My appointment was scheduled for July 13, but I am really concerned about this nodule, so I called to be put on the waiting list if someone canceled.\u00a0\u00a0The endo was able to see me yesterday on short notice.\u00a0\u00a0However, after a very cursory exam, with some blood drawn, he declared that there was clearly nothing wrong with me or my thyroid--except that I had this mass on it.\u00a0\u00a0Any symptoms I have noticed (voice hoarseness, profound fatigue, headaches, nausea, appetite decrease, weight gain) clearly have nothing to do with my thyroid because I don't \"look\" like there's anything wrong with me (the blood work isn't back yet, but whatever).\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the mass on my thyroid is either nothing or cancer.\u00a0\u00a0The mass will have to be biopsied, but the soonest he could do it is August 13--but that doesn't matter because thyroid cancer is so slow growing that waiting to biopsy won't change my outcome if it is cancer.I think this endo is kind of an a$$, but whatever.\u00a0\u00a0My question(s) to you is(are): should I be concerned that he's unconcerned about the nodule?\u00a0\u00a0Or is it a good sign?\u00a0\u00a0Is it typical to wait this long to have a biopsy for a nodule?\u00a0\u00a0Should I just (try) to be patient, or should I fight to see someone else?\u00a0\u00a0I understand that doctors are busy, and perhaps this is no big deal to him--but to me, it means everything.\u00a0\u00a0I am trying to prevent this nodule from hijacking my life, but if it's cancer, I'd rather know NOW.\u00a0\u00a0Isn't it true that there's really no way of knowing how long I've had the nodule, and if it is cancer, when or if it could metastasize?\u00a0\u00a0Should we EVER be laissez faire about a potential cancer?Okay, this has gone on longer than I intended, so if you made it to here, I appreciate it.Thank you,TwistedHelix",
