            "answer": "Thanks for the reply. That's interesting that you bring up a thyroid condition.\u00a0\u00a0During winter months my feet tend to get really cold and my fingers as well. It gets to the point of numbness and I have to soak them in warm water to regain feeling.I was told that it could be thryroid related and I had numerous tests done on regular basis. But nothing showed up along those lines, maybe I should look into it further.",

            "answer": "Hi Real, your fingers that get really cold with numbness could also be raynards disease, for that there a simple thing, Boric acid, youtake a 1/4 teaspoon in a lite of water and drink through the day, everyday and slowly it will go, get your Boric acid from the pharmacist in the chemists.And your other problem comes from masturbating with a to harder grip, you need to go back to basics and relearn to masturbate with a feather light touch, and before you do that, you may need to take a break from masturbating, for 6 to 8 weeks, before you restart, to give you body a chance to relax itself and reboot before you go back into it, and start the feather light touch, with oil, this way it would simulate a vagina.Good Luck",

    "question": "I am a male that hasn't been with many sexual partners, however I'm becoming increasingly frustrated since I can't orgasm easily by vaginal sex due lack of stimulation.\u00a0\u00a0I found that I need a handjob with intense friction and a very strong grip to orgasm.\u00a0\u00a0I also found that having a dryer vagina provides more sensation on my penis allowing for orgasm.\u00a0\u00a0Where as when I use lube for hand jobs or a well lubricated vagina provides very little stimulation on my penis.How do I increase my penile sensitivity so that I can more easily achieve orgasm through traditional vaginal sex?",
