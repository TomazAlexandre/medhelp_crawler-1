            "answer": "All of us who suffer from PCOS, do not suffer from the same symptoms. If you are waiting to have kids for a year, then bc might be your best option just so you can have a period each month. Because when your on bc, it also reduces your risks for ovarian cysts. And also just because you haven't ovulated before, doesn't mean it still couldn't happen if your not on the bc. There's really only one type of PCOS, just different symptoms. Allot of ladies who have it, normally never get a period...but I on the other hand, always had a period just really heavy and long. I also am not insulin resistant too. So as you can see, my symptoms are very different from some of the other ladies on here. I was being treated with BC Yasmin and Metformin. I came off the pill this month for the first time, and I might have ovulated on cd15. So far things are looking good, no irregular bleeding yet.So really it's up to you if you think you should go on bc. To me IMO, I think you should only because your not ready for a baby yet. If you were wanting a baby now, then your doctor would probably treat you with Clomid or another fertitily med.",

            "answer": "It sounds like you are type 2 PCOS, like me. Birth control was the worse choice I have made in treatment. It completely undid all my hard work for weight loss in less than a month (15 pounds with no change in diet and increase in exercise) and has screwed up my periods. I am not insulin resistant and have not had a hard time getting pregnant, I just had a hard time nursing my babies, losing the baby fat, and having a regular period. Yes I have \"picture proof\" of the cysts.I found this blog to be helpful. http://thepcosfactor.blogspot.com/2010/07/know-your-pcos.html",

    "question": "HI ALLSO I am reading some info, seems there are different types of PCOS, which may explain why we are all so darn different!!!So ANYONE with any idea what any of these words means, WHICH AM I? I am trying to work out whether I want to go natural or whether I should do as my Gynea says and stick to BC... I have read with some types this is the worst thing, others - the best... SO SICK of confusing info! (VENT!!!) ... anyway any help on the below would be lovely; my symptoms are...- Normal weight (size 8-10 (max)) 53kgs 165cm tall... (SO normal)- Irregular/no periods- mens' pains all the time/generally dull aches and discomfort (when off pill)- Depression/Anxiety (I get the feeling some people think this is a cop-out)?- Tiredness- Hormones are all normal (except prolactin VERY slightly elivated) meaning all my hormone levels are normal- Policystic Ovaries (none/very irregular ovulation?)I dont like BC pill, and I dont see the point in taking it if a) my hormones are FINE and b) I am not ovulating anyway... so I dont know how I can treat this unless I can work out which type I have?I want to think about children in about a year - so my doc says BC till then, but from what I read it can make it worse in some types (like mine wouldnt be conventional) as all my hormones are fine and I am not overweight or underweight.traditional PCOS -- anovulatory, increased androgens, no insulin resistanceendocrine syndrome X -- anovulatory, increased androgens, insulin resistance or type 2 diabetesnon-traditional PCOS --anovulatory, normal androgens, obese, insulin resistant or type 2 diabetesnon-traditional PCOS -- ovulatory, increased androgens, mild insulin resistanceidiopathic hirsutism -- ovulatory, increased androgens, no insulin resistanceTHANK YOU - hopefully someone can shed some light, I am going to be taking this to my next app to battle it out with them (the fight for natural therapy)...x",
