            "answer": "\"I have just had an emg/nerve conduction study and the doctor was clearly biased.\"That's difficult for us to determine when the results are not posted. Besides, didn't you watch the monitor during the test or ask for a print out and /or obtain an electronic file of the test? Go get a second or third opinion if you feel the testing doctor was \"biased\".\"Yes.. I know that diabetes contributes to this...\"What is \"this\"?Obvious by your symptoms you have seen multiple doctors, but where? Have you gone to a major teaching hospital for analysis? These are normally found on or near major college universities and where the experts practice medicine.Your Tags mention diabetes and pain. Do you have a diabetes question?",
