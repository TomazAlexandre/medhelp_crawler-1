            "answer": "Hi!Since you have muscle cramps, and pins and tingling, electrolyte imbalance should be looked into along with pinched nerves, peripheral neuropathy due to lupus, Lyme\u2019s and thyroid disorders. Get parathyroid function also assessed. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "In September 2013 I was sitting at work in my chair and felt these pins and needles feelings in my hands and feet. There was nerve pain shooting through my arms and hands off and on. I went to doctor and got blood work done. Everything came out normal. Symptoms went away then came back. I forgot to mention. My symptoms seemed like peripheral neuropathy, but no sign of Diabetes. I'm an obsessive thinker and the unknown is driving me crazy. Symptoms went away for a few months but came back. Now I'm getting these feeling of numbness in my hands and legs and back pain. Also muscle cramps and spasms off and on. The more I move around the better I feel. Does this sound like ms?\u00a0\u00a0I don't have eye symptoms other than a few eye twitches. But I have been stressed out. Your advice would be appreciated. Thanks!",
