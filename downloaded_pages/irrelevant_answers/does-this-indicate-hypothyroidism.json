            "answer": "Thank you both for your responses!! I have never heard of Secondary Hypothyroidism...the Nurse practitioner felt it would be better to take a \"wait & see\" approach and re-run labs in 3mos. However, I felt something more should be done! I will contact my primary doctor and be a lil more aggressive in request for treatment.",

    "question": "Hi all,I am a recently diagnosed Lupus and Type 2 diabetes patient. On last week, the Nurse Practitioner ran some additional tests due to tachycardia, hand tremors, excessive sweating, hair loss, and weight gain. I received the results on yesterday but was told labs would be rechecked in 3 months. I'm worried that I won't make it that long!
