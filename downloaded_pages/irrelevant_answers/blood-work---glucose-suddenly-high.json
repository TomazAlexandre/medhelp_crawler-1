At the time A1C was 13.8 meaning avg blood sugar over 300.\u00a0\u00a0Doc say diabetes can be an effect of HCV.\u00a0\u00a0Went on Tx and continued insulin, better diet, light exercise - generally more healty living.\u00a0\u00a0Was PCR clear at week 12 which also coincided with a bunch of endocrinology-type tests.\u00a0\u00a0By that time (12 wks into Tx)A1C down to 6.3 avg blood sugar 120.\u00a0\u00a017 Weeks into TX more endo tests A1C fown to 5.8 - and off insulin.Docs believe (and so do I) that for me diabetes was a manisfestation of HCV and that clearing the virus eliminated the diabetes. Just finished TX (last night\u00a0\u00a0- last of the riba) and have a series of post-TX tests schedule over next 3 months to see what happens after body receovers from 'the stuff'.HCV and Tx seem to mask/hide/elevate/worsen other conditions.\u00a0\u00a0Get with your doc - I had no problems with diabetes during tx - just the opposite.",
