    "question": "Hi! Good day,My father was diagnosed right now with Diabetes and he was experiencing severe pain on his legs that would let him awake during the night. This pain was so severe that would even let him to scream just to relieve somehow. It was almost 6 months now and no exact medicine was available, only pain relievers. Also, he experienced cold hands that will let him go for a hot water just to warm his cold hands. I just wanted to know what would be the exact medications for this illment? Because doctors that diagnosed him will just say that it is brought by the diabetes and that the primary factor is to take medicine for diabetes. But unfortunately, it doesnt help even his sugar level was back to normal.Thank you so much for your time in reading, and i am expecting your humble advice....",
