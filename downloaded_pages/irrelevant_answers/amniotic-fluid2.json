            "answer": "I'm 35.5 and have had too much fluid for about 3 weeks now. They did a double and triple check for diabetes all was fine. All ultrasounds are showing notification normal and can see our lil lady swallowing and everything. Dr told me it sometimes just happens without much explanation and they have continued to monitor. She's weighing in at 7lbs 12oz and with extra fluid Dr thinks she'll be arriving early but otherwise looks healthy. Take it an appt at a time and ask Dr lots of questions to ease your mind!",

            "answer": "Most of the time the extra fluid itself causes absolutely no problems. They monitor you because they want to know WHY you have this extra fluid. Sometimes it happens for no reason but sometimes it can be caused by a swallowing issue in the baby, digestive problems such as duodenal atresia, or if baby is urinating too much (a sign of possible high blood sugar)",

            "answer": "The Dr will be able to have some idea of fluid levels each time you have an ultrasound. It starts becoming a greater concerns around 25-30 weeks. At this point baby should be swallowing and urinating fluid effectively and if there's any concern your Dr may decide to do other tests to more accurately measure",
