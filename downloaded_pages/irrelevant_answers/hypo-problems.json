            "answer": "Thank you ChitChatNine for the help!\u00a0\u00a0I tried to look through but it doesn't seem like there is very much info regarding the pit tumors.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again for trying to help me out!\u00a0\u00a0:)My referral went through already and my appointment is set for Friday, October 3rd, in Omaha, Nebrask with the offices of Dr. Timothy Wahl, Diabetes & Endocrine Associates.\u00a0\u00a0Pretty satisfied that it took only one day to have the referral put into place and an appointment setup.\u00a0\u00a0(I figured it would take a little longer because my husband is military and sometimes they aren't known to be speedy!\u00a0\u00a0haha!)At the same time I'm having to go back to visit with my orthopedic doctor about my right hip, sometimes I wonder if autoimmune disease can attack cartilidge.\u00a0\u00a0I've now had 2 hip surgeries in the past 3 1/2 years due to cartilidge damage and now arthritis.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, a whole other story I'll save for my blog.Thanks again for the help and welcome!Kat",

    "question": "I started out with Graves Disease - thyroid problems when I was 22, that was 14 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I was treated with RAI 131, and had a thyroid storm afterwards.\u00a0\u00a0Went through loads of physical therapy, dermatologists, cardiologists and other speciality doctors until I was back on my feet again.\u00a0\u00a0Have problems with B-12, shots don't work, so I take a form of Methyl B-12 so my body can absorb it.\u00a0\u00a0I've been on 200mcg of Synthroid for quite a long time.Lately I have had problems with my hearing (almost like I'm going deaf), my muscles are cramping again in the middle of the night while sleeping is the worst, my face is swollen, I've gained 30 pounds in a very short period of time, I am tired a lot but I run after my two teens non-stop so never paid much attention to it...and my fingernails are starting to fall off again (the last time that happened I was hyperthyroid).However, I went to visit with my doctor today and she said that my TSH was a little low and my T3 was high and my T4 was low...I don't know I can't remember, I will have to have them make me a copy so I can post it.\u00a0\u00a0She did say that my reflexes were fast to start and extremely slow to return....something about Myxedema possibly or a tumor on the pituatary gland.\u00a0\u00a0I will have a referral to a specialist in 3 days...so I'll know more then.So, my question is, have any of you had similar problems and was it fairly easy to treat?\u00a0\u00a0I know that sounds like such a stupid question, but I would like to know from someone who's walked this journey to advise.\u00a0\u00a0I went through the first part without being able to speak to anyone about what was going on...so now, being a bit older...I would like to seek some wisedom from someone willing to share...Thanks in advance,Kat",
