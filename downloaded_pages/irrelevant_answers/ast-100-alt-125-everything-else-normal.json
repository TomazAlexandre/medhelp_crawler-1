            "answer": "I think your doctor is being careful with you and, in my opinion, that's a very good thing.I am not a doctor or in the medical field in any capacity so bear that in mind as you read this.First, your liver enzymes would probably be characterized as mildly to moderately elevated. They are not that high. You could have a little fatty liver disease which is quite common these days and generally not a serious risk. Your poorly controlled diabetes could have also contributed to your enzyme elevation so you would be wise to attempt to achieve better glucose control. Frequently when a patient presents with elevated liver enzymes doctors order a viral hepatitis panel just to rule out that possibility so don't be alarmed if your doctor orders those tests.Cholesterol lowering drugs - statins - can sometimes cause elevated liver enzymes so it is wise to have a baseline level for your liver enzymes before starting statin therapy.I wouldn't be worried about the sonogram of your liver. As you know it's a non-invasive test and it's good protocol to have this done when you have\u00a0\u00a0 elevated liver enzymes. I will give you one piece of advice however about undergoing the procedure. If a technician or anyone other than a doctor you have a relationship with performs the test I would not ask any questions at all about the results. I did this once and the technician mentioned that my bile ducts may have a problem. I worried myself sick for 5 days until I got to see my hepatologist. When I asked him about my bile ducts he told me they were fine and asked me why I asked him that. I learned then - if the tech said everything was fine I wouldn't be completely relieved until I heard it from my doctor. And if the tech said anything slightly negative I'd worry like a fool. If I have to undergo any tests like that I will not even look at the person performing the test.Good luck to you.Mike",
