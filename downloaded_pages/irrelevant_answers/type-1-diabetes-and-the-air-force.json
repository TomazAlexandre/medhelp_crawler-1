I have the same questions that you had back then in 07'I don't know what is going to happen to me. I'd like to know if you were able to stay in and if not the benefits inwhich you are at nowI hope that this is ok.",

            "answer": "Hi everyone, My brother who is active USAF was just diagnosed with type 1. Me being active USAF and his bigger brother, the first thing I started to do was go through the regs to help him.Not to kill hope but the Air Force doesn't want people with Type 1 Diabetes. Its the liability, its nothing personal. Trying to fight to stay in, seems as if it does\u00a0\u00a0more damage to you because of that fact they view you as you being more capable of handling your diease.My best advice is to document everything and get light-duty profiles. I could not understand what you are all going through, but it is so painful to watch the Air Force take away my brothers uniform, even though he is one of the most capable and strong individuals I have ever met.Its the policy your fighting, so untill they change the policy you have to fight for percentages. Get the best percentages you can. Being a Victim of Diabetes is not your fault, and you should not be punished because of it.There are alot of key things out there that will get you an awesome percentage,\u00a0\u00a0there is a study out there that has proven 1 in 1000 people who have had anthrax vaccine become insulin dependent. You can report this to the CDC.Stay vigilant in reporting every little complication you have. Don't try to fight the system or tough it out, because the Air Force has taken a very stern stance on it. Get your percentage and start early, don't wait until after the MEB!Like others have said, hope for the best and prepare for the worst. Medically seperated you are out there alone, medically retired is no different than a 20 year retirement. The difference between Medically retired and medically seperated is 1%!!! DOCUMENT EVERY LITTLE THING!!!!I hope this helps....Good Luck and Keep Hope in your Heart!",
