            "answer": "Hi...this is hard to look at not seeing the range for the lab that tested ur samples....DO u have the range scale?And u r right there was a change some time ago and not all labs changed their scales to reflect this.....a yr or so ago it affected many with Vitamin D levels...they were all way off bcuz the scales were wrong.So it was not just the scales for thyroid functions that was off...always look into the lab doing ur testing.\"selma\"",

            "answer": "From what I've figured out, my TSH is definitely high. In 2003, the American Assoc. Of Clinical Endocrinologists came out with new regulations saying a TSH over 3.0 is high. It used to be 5.5 or 6 that was considered high. Also, my T4 is low at 1.1, when it should be greater than 4.5. So that would certainly indicate thyroid dysfunction. My body is ramping up the TSH(why it is high) to try to compensate and make enough T4, which it is unable to do. I've not been able to find out what \"normal\" range is for T3. Whether or not the level of antibodies suggests Hashimotos(lab said no), there is certainly thyroid dysfunction.Ive had TSH checked in the past, but never asked for the # before now. Makes me wonder how long this has been going on. Ugh.Could this all be caused by pituitary malfunction from the brain compression, since Hashimotos antibodies were within normal?I called my dr office and told them that TSH should be under 3, according to newer recommendations and asked for a referral to an endocrinologist.",

            "answer": "I know what u mean, but u still have to look at the scale the lab uses...just in case...but yes under 3 is preferred.Make sure the Endo is not one that specializes in Diabetes as they do not test nething but TSH and do not seem to treat Hashimoto's....I tried several...and finally had to give up going to one and my PCP is treating me...the ENDO would not put meon meds.U will need an ultra sound to verify the presence of nodules.....I had drs ask me if I never had thyroid issues, I would say no...bcuz I was never told of nething,...going forward, I say...I have no idea...which makes them stop and look....how should I know???Looking back I can see when I was hyper and times I was hypo....all the unexplained weight gains and losses over the yrs.....I always told my drs but none of them checked for a thyroid issue.I feel we need to get reports on all Labs....and of course MRI's xrays etc......The Thyroid forum here on MedHelp was beneficial in helping me understand a lot of this...so go over there and ask questions-http://www.medhelp.org/forums/Thyroid-Disorders/show/73?camp=mscJust be advised not all Endos r worth their weight in salt....lol....\"selma\"",

            "answer": "Well, with PCOS, type 2 diabetes, and possibly thyroid issues, my dr agreed it was warranted to get a referral to an endo. She put in the referral today, so I should hear from the endo's office next week.I did a lot of research yesterday, and going by the newer recommended values by the American Assoc of Clincal Endocrinologists, my TSH is high, and my free T3 and T4 are low. That points to hypothyroidism.We'll see what the endo says...Thanks guys I appreciate the info and support.-Jenn",

    "question": "Ok, in know Selma deals with this, plus a few others. I was wondering if you guys could give me some insight into my lab results.They're within \"normal\" range per my lab, but I know that in 2005, the American Association of Endocrinologists or whatever association I read about online, recommended that \"normal\" ranges be changed because many people have symptoms even within \"normal\" range. Is my info correct? Let me know what you think please.TSH: 3.5 I know they try to keep thyroid patients between 1-2 because symptoms crop up at higher levels. I believe they recommended that anything above 2.5 warrants investigation by an endocrinologist.T3: 3.2T4: 1.1Hashimotos antibodies: 10I don't know what \"normal\" is supposed to be for those 3, what warrants further investigation.Thanks for the help,-Jen",
