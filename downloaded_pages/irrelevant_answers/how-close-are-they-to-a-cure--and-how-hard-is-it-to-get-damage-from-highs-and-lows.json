            "answer": "I personally am not anticipating a cure for Type 1 any time in the near future, but I think they continue to find technology and medicine that improves treatment of both types of Diabetes. Just look how far we've come since our parents or grandparents time!As for complications, they come from highs, not lows, though there is also some evidence that frequent swings from high to low or back are also damaging. All studies indicate that complications begin to set in with consistent numbers over 140. That doesn't mean if you spike over 140 and then come right back down you are doomed to complications. But you want your goal to be, as much as possible to stay under 140 and if you do go higher you want to do a correction to bring it back down. Frequent testing, reducing carbs and using I:C ratios to determine doses and changing dose as needed are the way to avoid complications. There are people who have gone 50 years without complications; they are not inevitable, but it takes work to maintain good control.",

            "answer": "Thank you! And I go to see my doctor, Next Tuesday, One thing that gets me on a cure this came from my Dr : \"They've proven it to cure mice in less than a week literally, Yes we understand that people are up about a cure saying there wont be one, Because in the 50's - late 90's they did not have technology like we do today. They are in the current process of finding a cure and are close. They used to think that insulin was the cure for diabetes till later researchers found out that insulin was a life support, Not a cure.\" Not being rude, Might I suggest going to \" www.JDRF.org\" List alot and how close they are with all of the stuff funded towards the cure. :-) I expect one in the next 2 - 5 years, Researchers are finding more and more closer to it. They are working on it in humans as I type hehe...No joke. Not trying to change your mind, But to give someone a positive out - look, I myself thought there at first there wouldn't be a cure, But I truely belive there will be one soon. I want to be a marine, And wont give up on a cure, In my opinion it'd be really stupid with all the research and technology grannit a long time ago they said there would be a cure, but they thought it was insulin hehe, Plus they didn't have the technology then, but know we do :-).-- Have a good day!",

Quite scary to be honest but so far she seems to be healthy...",

    "question": "I hear back and forth on how close they are really to a cure, I hear from\u00a0\u00a0some people \"Well, In the next 20 or so years...\", But I also hear from my Dr's, Is that they expect one in the next \"2 - 5 years....\" Just real cerious, Its something thats normally on my mind alot, Hehe. Basing it though the fact that I understand they've done alot of research and proven to literally cure mice in a week or so, of type 1 diabetes, I was wondering how close they are with it in humans. On behalf of that note, With getting kidney and liver damage, and such from running low/high here and there.....How hard is it too get damage, and can the cure work with a little damage? And is there a course of time that it develops? Because there are some days I find that I'm VERRY active, And some days where I don't know if I move an inch heh.",
