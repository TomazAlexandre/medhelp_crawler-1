It pretty much is a meal plan to curve your chocolate intake, take away your bad fats, increase good fats, and stay on better sugars.\u00a0\u00a0(:\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps!!\u00a0\u00a0I've lost 25 lbs. on this.\u00a0\u00a0And I've never felt better!",

    "question": "Hi my name is Danielle. I was diagnosed with PCOS when i was 14 now i am 20. Over the years i have noticed I have gained weight and not only have I noticed but everyone around me noticed...having people tell you your fat is not a good feeling. At first i brushed it off and bought new clothes but now i am getting to the point of I cant take this anymore. I am young i shouldnt be ashamed to take pictures, and put on swimsuits. But as most of us know it is really hard to lose weight. I have tried almost everything!! I am already borderline diabetic so i am afraid if i take the medicine the doctor prescribes i will become diabetic. Help me please at this point i will try anything!!!",
