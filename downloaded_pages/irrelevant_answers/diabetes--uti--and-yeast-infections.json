            "answer": "Hi Katyanne,My sister also has chronic yeast infections, and UTIs, too, and I know how terribly frustrating that can be. I am not a doctor, just a volunteer with a diabetic teenager, so I can't give you any medical advice. I will say that it could very well be that the yeast infections/UTIs bear no relationship to the diabetes.Have you tried Diflucan, the medicine that stops yeast infections right away? I also get a yeast infection within 24 hours of going on antibiotics (of any kind), but if I take one Diflucan pill as soon as I start the antibiotics, I don't have any problems. It's a prescription medication, so you'd have to get it from your doc.I would also say keep trying to figure this out, and consult another specialist. Your doctors should not dismiss what is clearly a recurring and difficult medical problem.Good luck",

            "answer": "My Daughter has chronic UTI's and until about a year ago she was getting one right after the other. Her Urologist recommended a medication called Ellura. It works tons better than any cranberry juice or pill at the store. It's been wonderful. They have a website or you can purchase it on Amazon.com. She's only had one UTI in the last year. The only downfall is the price ( $ 129.00) every three months.",
