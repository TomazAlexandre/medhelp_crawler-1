            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Dreaming that you are emptying the bladder but wetting yourself while sleeping could be a stress disorder or a sleep disorder. This can also be a lucid dream where one is aware of dreaming something. Chances of it being stress incontinence are less as it would cause leaking urine even during the day. The reasons could also be functionally small bladder, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, urinary bladder wall instability, UTI, stones and neurological problems.Limit fluids in the evening. Set up an alarm your self and try and wake up 3-4 hours after sleep and use the washroom. This helps a number of times to break the sleep pattern and you will with time automatically start getting up.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. No, there will be no harm in using the sofa. If possible keep it out in sunshine for a day. Use a disinfectant spray on it. If possible get it dry cleaned.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi,I am a 25yo female. Few nights ago, I dreamt that my bladder was full and dreamt that I went to the toilet to empty my bladder. I then woke up and found that I had wet the sofa. I have dreamt a few times in the past of needing to go to the toilet to empty my bladder and have woken up on time to use the toilet. This is my first time emptying my bladder while dreaming. Is this something to be worried about?Also, I left the urine to dry on the sofa as I don't know how to clean it. There is no smell and stain because I had a sofa cover on. I'm wondering though whether it is dangerous to breathe in the dried urine? Because I understand that urine consists of toxic and waste which are excreted by the body.And is it dangerous to touch the dried urine?",
