            "answer": "University of Michigan MS cline.\u00a0\u00a0The docs have been phenomenal.\u00a0\u00a0His first neuro was just O.K, and at Mayo Clinic, the doc was cold as ice, totally disinterested and almost heartless, although obviously intelligent and experience.\u00a0\u00a0My son's wife constantly encourages him, sypathizes with him, but won't let him feel sorry for himself or bring her down.\u00a0\u00a0She keeps him going.\u00a0\u00a0But, the older kids are starting to notice the difference in my son, and have expressed fear that they too could get MS.\u00a0\u00a0The dynamics are challenging, and anybody who blithely says \"oh, just be positive\"\u00a0\u00a0hasn't a clue.\u00a0\u00a0MS is a minute-to-minute struggle and takes great courage and fortitude to survive.\u00a0\u00a0I have checked out many of your suggestions and my son's wife is also on the hunt for any potential help.I just read \"What's Killing You and What To Do About it!\" by Dr. Donald Monus and David Hamilton.\u00a0\u00a0Monus claims to have cured an MS patient.\u00a0\u00a0He is in Largo, Florida and his number is 727-585-2879.\u00a0\u00a0No website.\u00a0\u00a0But, you can be I will pass this info to my son.You have your hands full and I can only imagine the frustration and pain in your life.\u00a0\u00a0But, continued hope and fierce intention to survive MS is a positive weapon in this fight.",

    "question": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0thanks so much for posting your son's story.\u00a0\u00a0My husband has had progressive leg weakness since 2004 and can no longer run, jump, swim, and has leg pain and spasms.\u00a0\u00a0he has 16 T2 hyperintense lesions and whole brain atrophy, but no diagnosis.I would highly recommend reading \"Climbing Higher\" and \"Living Well\" by Montel Williams.\u00a0\u00a0he talks about his experiences with MS.\u00a0\u00a0he has his own foundation which contribute 100 percent of his donations to medical research for MS.\u00a0\u00a0The Center Without Walls also spends alot of money on research for MS.\u00a0\u00a0The MS society only spends about 20 cents per dollar contributed to research.I would also recommend the book \"Up the Creek With A Paddle\" about LDN.\u00a0\u00a0You might want the information in the future.\u00a0\u00a0Does your son have hyper reflexes on a neuro exam??We have six children and to tell you the truth, the emotional toll this whole disease has been taking on my husband is horrible.\u00a0\u00a0It is destroying us and our family as the neuros continue to enjoy their lives.\u00a0\u00a0I am so frustrated I could scream.I would also recommend \"Lean On Me\" and also go to the website for the \"Rocky Mountain MS Center\".\u00a0\u00a0They embrace conventional and alternative medicine treatments for MS.\u00a0\u00a0They seem very advanced and open to new ideas.\u00a0\u00a0I like their website alot and they seem like a great place for people with MS.Can you please tell me what U of M stands for??Thank you again.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate your post.Elaine",
