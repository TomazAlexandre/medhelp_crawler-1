            "answer": "Anxiety may be responsible. Be active and don't sit for long periods at a one place. Take some walks and some breathing exercises to help you stay calm. Lastly, develop a new hobby, keep yourself occupied, give thanks to God. And If the symptoms continue for long, then you must get diagnosed by a head specialist.",

            "answer": "Hey Chuckie.What you're experiencing is called \"Hypnopompic Hallucination\".It is during the transition from sleep to awakeness that this takes place.In your case I suspect unconscious material (such as images of spiders- which is consistent with your background) gets unveiled (spills over) in the conscious.One thing that I would suggest is that you get sleep apnea, narcolepsy & diabetes-induced dehydration all ruled out, as they could be the triggering factors.I'm a board certified consulting hypnotist by the way.I hope this helps, however, please note that my comments are not intended as a substitute for medical advice.Best wishes.Niko",

    "question": "I'm a 57 year old man, somewhat healthy(have diabetes) and active. Lately, I've been having these visions, of a spider like creature that's crawling on my ceiling and sometimes up my wall then slowly fades away. It happens sometimes after a short nap or if I wake in the middle of the night. I know I'm fully awake because I blink several times and stare at it hard. Its really strange. The color of it is a cream transparent like spider with many many legs, not much of a body or head. The movement of the legs is very fast and noticeable. I was wondering what could be the cause? I'm not on any medications or narcotics other than my insulin. Any diagnosis or suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks.Chuck",
