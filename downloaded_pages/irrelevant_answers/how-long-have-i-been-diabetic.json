            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.There is not way to tell for sure how long you have had diabetes. The onset of complications would be affected by how high your sugar has run. This is why it is so important to control your blood glucose going forward. Keeping control of blood sugar will help to minimize and prevent the complications of diabetes in the future.Cathy",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a year and a half ago.\u00a0\u00a0I had a blood clot in my leg that the doctor called an \"unprovoked event\" so they started looking for possible causes and found diabetes(also a heredity blood clotting factor).\u00a0\u00a0I already have diabetic retinopathy and nerve damage in my feet..\u00a0\u00a0How long does it take for this kind of damage to develop?\u00a0\u00a0In other words, how long have I been diabetic?\u00a0\u00a0 Ballpark.\u00a0\u00a0I don't guess there's any way to determine this exactly. Testing has shown that my heart, liver, and kidneys are undamaged.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for any enlightenment.",
