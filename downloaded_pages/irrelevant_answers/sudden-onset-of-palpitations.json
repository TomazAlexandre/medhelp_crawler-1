    "question": "I am 44, female, and on four meds for HTN.\u00a0\u00a0I am also diabetic and on oral meds, along with various other medical issues (hypothyroid, controlled, for instance).Last night I had a sudden onset of palpitations, with the \"missed/skipped beat\" coming about 5-15 times per minute.\u00a0\u00a0My bp was not terribly high, at around 140's/90's, but I did feel light headed and \"strange\" during this time.\u00a0\u00a0I had just eaten popcorn a while before and my bg was elevated at 198.\u00a0\u00a0I drank some water and took a scheduled potassium supplement a bit early (10meq), but the palps continued for over an hour.\u00a0\u00a0I finally went to bed and when I woke up during the night they were still there, but gone in the morning.I have recently changed from Metformin 100 mg x 2, to Coreg 25 mf x 2, and I also take Adalat 60mg, Lisinopril 20 mg and Micardis 80mg.\u00a0\u00a0I take Metformin 850 x 3, Januvia 100mg (only for about the last two weeks) and just started on Avandia 4 mg for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My other meds are for thyroid, GERD, potassium, generalized dystonia (levodopa).Is this something I should be concerned about?\u00a0\u00a0I see my doctor in a week and a half, but do I need to contact her before then if this happens again?ThanksRamona",
