    "question": "Any time I have the smalleat amount of pop I get very light headed. Even just a sip at times. Just now I have been drinking a cup of 7 up mixed with Orange Juice, the first pop I have had in probably a year, but half way through my drink and I litterally feel like I am going to pass out!Though it is worst with pop, it is beggining to happen with other drinks too. I can't drink Fruitopia anymore, it's progressing to just as bad as pop. And sometime even water. Now not often with water but sometimes it just seems anything I drink period makes me light headed. Not normally enough for my vision to blur and almost pass out like just now though. For the most part just pop and juices though.",
