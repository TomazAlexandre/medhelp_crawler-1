            "answer": "I would definitely say you need some medical attention. In fact, I would copy what you wrote to us and take it directly to the ER. I would think they would have to see you. Your symptoms do not sound good to me, and I would sure be wanting to check them out. I know moving causes stress, and you are undoubtedly under lots of that,but, I feel there is more to this, so, please, try to get attention as soon as possible.Please keep us posted.",

    "question": "I've been told I have a murmor of the heart. If I'm not feeling well, I can feel the heart is not beating good, and with a sthescope I can hear the murmor is loud, and not sounding good. I've just rently moved to the UK, am under stress. I do take blood pressure pills, blood thinning medicine, (warfrin) and metformin for diabetes. I've been hospitalized in the past for pulmonary embolisms and heart arythmias. I had just got here from the USA, and I started feeling my heart having problems to pump blood, very bad arthymias, I was short of breath, and normaly would have it only for a while and then it comes right, it was like this for 4 days, thought it was embolisms but I was on my warfrin. I then got tightness on chest and in the center pain, it lasted for a few minutes and then went away but the breathing problems and weird beatings of heart continued, where my husand said the pulse was weak and sometimes very slow, and then very fast. I was thining of going for help, but I'm visiting here for 6 months. Have no health insurance, and my husband is a British Citizen and his trying to find a job, only when he has one, could he try and help me and the rest of the family to get into the UK. I was weak and very tired for a few days. Then a cough developed, notall the time, but during the day at any time, and I cough until I bring up bubbly frothy sprutum. I also have pain in my right side of back where the lungs are, and have had pain in my bones and joints. I took anti fllmaentary and its now much better, but I'm still left with coughing, right side of back is still painful, and lower back where kidneys are, and I bring up the bubbly phegm. I must mention then ext day I was in a daze,and I would write words I don't remember thinking, words totaly out of place, and light headed etc, not good balance. I'm worried now as what is wrong and whether I should go to a dr, but then I can't have any tests done, because I'm a visitor in the UK.\u00a0\u00a0Do I have a heart defect, or did I have a heart attack or stroke, and what about the pain in the bones, please give me some ideas of what I should do.",
