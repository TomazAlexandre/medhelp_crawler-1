            "answer": "Rita,First of all, since it is on the left side, you may want to confirm your heart is ok.\u00a0\u00a0Other than that, it sounds as if you may have a pinched nerve somewhere maybe in your neck area.\u00a0\u00a0That can make your tingling feeling and race horses could definitely cause the pinching.\u00a0\u00a0After you confirm your heart is ok, I would suggest a visit to the chiropractor or doctor for a muscle relaxer to free it.Good luck to you!Jenny",

            "answer": "I agree with gabbygirl. Since it is on the left side, I would have your heart checked, but, other than that, I suspect it is a pinched nerve and a good chriopractor can help that in no time. I have that same problem, but, in both hands and fingers, and my chiropractor really helps, I also have TOS (thoracic outlet syndrome) and this really causes the tingling, etc. TOS is caused by very tight shoulder blade muscles and also neck muscles and they impinge the flow of blood to the hand and fingers and even the head and face.",
