Which i am hypoglycemic so i guess still with the pregnancy (which is strange). I asked about the water & dr said i am dehydrated & have been since the last apt 2 wks ago. ive been throwing up a lot recently and had the poops & with having the heat on he says thats why. I mean great he can tell me why but i feel like i cant fix it on my own. & if i go to hospital, it has to either be alone (at night) or with my daughter during day. Ugh, im just so frustrated",

    "question": "I'm 32 weeks & not only have I had a lot of issues with preterm labor but now, I feel sick all the time. Also tired all the time but can never seem to fall asleep at night. I feel really dehydrated & Idk how to fix it unless I go get an IV... I drink about eight 32 oz glasses of water a day...at least. Idk what to do anymore. But feeling this way & dealing with my 4 yr old is really making me not want this baby anymore ;(",
