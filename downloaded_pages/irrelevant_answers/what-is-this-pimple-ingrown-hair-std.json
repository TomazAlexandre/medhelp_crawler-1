            "answer": "Hi,How are you feeling?I think you should address the problem step wise.Firstly collect the sample in a sterile container or cotton swab and send for microbiological examination for blood culture.Secondly you need to evaluate for common systemic disorders like diabetes which can prolong the infection.Thirdly it could be due to ingrowth of hair follicle, if you do not have rash or scab formation around your genitalsI think you should consult a Dermatologist has he can do physical examination of the area.Good luck,Bye",

    "question": "There is a \"place\" in my groin area in the pubic hair region that I have a question about.\u00a0\u00a0I thought ingrown hair, but can't find a definite follicle causing the problem.\u00a0\u00a0This has occurred a few times before.\u00a0\u00a0It appears as a dark purple-ish \"underground\" zit like growth (without a surfaced white-head) and when touching, it has pain at times.\u00a0\u00a0When squeezing it to attempt and relieve the \"place,\" I come close to tearing up because it is extremely painful.Every once and a while, I am able to squeeze the problem area and relieve all stored inside which ends up being a decent amount of pus and blood.\u00a0\u00a0It scares me a bit to think of this area.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure its not attractive to anyone who would be exploring that part of my body.\u00a0\u00a0I have looked up Herpes, cysts, pimples, etc, but with no luck on figuring out what it is.If you need any additional information, please let me know.",
