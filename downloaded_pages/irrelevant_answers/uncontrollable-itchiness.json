            "answer": "Penny:After 28 years of itching, I can see why it's getting you down.\u00a0\u00a0\"Stress\" is so all-purpose an explanation that it explains almost nothing.The only condition your description reminds me of is cholinergic urticaria.\u00a0\u00a0These are non-allergic hives, brought on by heat, water, sweating, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone had you try a non-sedating antihistamine like Claritin?\u00a0\u00a0If not, I suggest getting a presription for this and taking one tablet a day for a month or so.\u00a0\u00a0If that suppresses the itch, you may want to stay on it, much as those with allergic noses do.Give it a shot.Best.Dr. Rockoff",

            "answer": "Try tell anyone that you are allergic to water! My son and I both have the same symptoms. I finally found a dermatologist that believed me, and he said that it runs in the family. It happens mostly in summer when the weather is muggy, but the itch is horrible. I now take 25mg of benadryl before showering or swimming, and hope that it doesn't make me drowsy. I have had this for 23 years (I'm 47 now)- mostly on my arms and legs.",

    "question": "Dear Doctor,I get this incredible itching, mostly on arms, and legs, no rashes associated at all, no dry skin, really bad after showers, baths, swimming, etc, makes me cry, getting to hate water.Cant sleep at night, too itchy, as soon as i wake up it starts again.No itching on face or torso, seems like every nerve cell in my body is awake and letting me know it.Ive had it since I was about 15, I am now 43, went to several doctors a few times, said it was stress.Gave me some tables, to take, after a few weeks it stops, then comes back again after a few months or so. Worse in summer, I am happily married, kids stress me out sometimes, is it stress, or something else wrong with my skin. There are no physical symptoms at all, my husband thinks i am crazy, and its all in my head. If there was a rash I could understand it.Have tried different soaps, washing powder, etc, thinking it may be these triggering it, but it comes back.HOW CAN I STOP IT PLEASE!!!! HELP, its driving me nuts!!!",
