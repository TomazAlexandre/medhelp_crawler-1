I didn't do anything different for the 3 hr as far as food intake. Just go in there and take that test and wait. I stressed a lot over it too but there's not much you should do besides knowing that you should eat healthy for the baby. Also, if you truly have GD you should be treated for it because that will put your baby in danger.",
