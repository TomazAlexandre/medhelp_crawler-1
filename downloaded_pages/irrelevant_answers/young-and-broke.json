            "answer": "First, if you have missed a period, take a pregnancy test.\u00a0\u00a0If it's negative then you need to see your doctor for some blood work.\u00a0\u00a0As the above poster said, you should be checked for thryoid disorders and diabetes as these both can cause many of the symptoms you have described.A change in diet can usually cause mild to severe digestive upset.Whether a pregnancy test is negative or positive it would be highly beneficial to see your physician and have tests run just to rule out other isses.\u00a0\u00a0IF you WERE to be diabetic or have a thyroid disorder, for example, you would need special treatment during pregnancy.Good luck!",

            "answer": "One other thing:No one here can give you the \"50/50 chance\" you are wanting in order to make your decision.\u00a0\u00a0With the symptoms you've described, you need to see a physician to be examined.\u00a0\u00a0Whether these symptoms are pregnancy related or something else, it needs to be addressed.\u00a0\u00a0It would be wise for you to find a way to scrape together the money to go see a doctor. Many areas have free or income based medical clinics. Perhaps you can check into those.",

    "question": "Hello my name is Kris i am an overweight 18 year old and i had a few questions me and my fiance believe i am pregnant i have been preganant before but\u00a0\u00a0i had a Miscarriage a couple weeks in so i kinda knew what to expect due to research but this isnt in anything i have read. i recently had to buy jeans that are 3 sizes bigger and gained almost 8lbs, i have a nagging pressure in my upper adomen and my bowels have been out of wack, i cant have anything with sugar in it not even protein shakes. along with mood swings and naseua, my horomones are on over drive i can have a random temper flare for no reason.My sleeping schuedule isnt constant anymore, and it seems hotter to me than it does to my family. i need to know if this is normal and if not what is the best way to go about it? i have recently became a vegeterian again could this be the cause of some of my problems??? Is there a possibility that i could be pregnant? i dont have much money and i want to have at least a\u00a0\u00a0higher possibility than a 50 50 before i go spend a great deal of it on a doctor",
