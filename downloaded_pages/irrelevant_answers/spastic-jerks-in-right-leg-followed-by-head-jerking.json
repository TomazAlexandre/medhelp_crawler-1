            "answer": "First of all, keep in mind that I am unable to diagnose you because I am unable to examine you, this forum is for educational purposes.The symptoms and story that you present sound complex and there is much data that I do not have.\u00a0\u00a0However, if I assume that the EEG, EMG\u00a0\u00a0etc were all normal, and going by your description of the 'jerks' these sound like myoclonus.\u00a0\u00a0This is a rapid jerk taht causes a brief jump in your arm or leg and can have a number of different causes.\u00a0\u00a0The most common is metabolic imbalances or a reaction to a medication (especially narcotic pain medications).\u00a0\u00a0A medication called Klonipin (clonazepam) can often be helpful in suppressing myoclonus, but the cause should be looked for as the first order of buisness.\u00a0\u00a0The pain that you describe makes me concerned about something called diabetic amyotrophy.\u00a0\u00a0This causes severe pain (usually the person cannot find a comfortable position no matter what), often associated with weight loss (10-15 lbs) and is common at the initial presentation of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The good news is that it is generally self limited (although it may last for 6 months to 1 year).\u00a0\u00a0Diabetic amyotrophy has been treated with steroids and/or IVIG in the past, but there is not a lot of evidence to support this.\u00a0\u00a0I would sugges that you go to a neurologist that specializes in neuromuscular neurology at a major academic center to be re-evaluated.I hope this has been helpful.",
