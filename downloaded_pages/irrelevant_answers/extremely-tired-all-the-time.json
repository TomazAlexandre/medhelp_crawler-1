            "answer": "Hi,Maybe you should have had your thyroid function checked? Also thinking diabetes, but then you had probably noticed that you were more thirsty too. Family history plays a role for your physician - and no, to me this doesn't sound very much like a \"teenage problem\".Any fainting episodes if you should have waited too long with a meal?Florena",

            "answer": "PlateletGal: I always wait until the last minute to wake up. I drag out of bed. Drag myself to the bus stop. Drag through school. I start to \"wake up\" around 3rd hour, which is 9:30. Then after lunch I'm out like a light for the rest of the day.ParamedFlorena: I don't faint, but I black out a lot. If I put my head down and when I come back up, I'm usually dizzy, but that goes away right away. And I'm always eating, so theres not really a way to tell if I would faint without eating.I don't think its depression or anything like that either. I have motivations to do good in school and talk to friends, but I'm just so tired. I'm almost falling asleep right now, probably gonna go take a nap.",

            "answer": "If I were you, after having your thyroid and EBV levels checked, I'd also ask to have a sleep study done, especially if everything comes back normal.\u00a0\u00a0You may have UARS (Upper Airways Respiratory Syndrome) or apnea or some other sleep disorder that causes you to not fall deeply enough into sleep for it to be refreshing to you.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, even teens can have sleep apnea.I hope you find out what's up - quickly.\u00a0\u00a0I have personal knowledge of what it's like to go years without enough sleep.\u00a0\u00a0And you're getting to the point where you may want to learn to drive, and a sleep disorder (if you have one) will not only be dangerous for you, but for everyone around you if you drive while sleep deprived.\u00a0\u00a0The good news is that there is much that can be done now for those with sleep disorders - if that's the problem, of course.Get checked out, get the necessary referrals, and good luck.",

For me the blackouts are like looking through a cloudy dark tunnel and I can only see the stuff in the center of my vision (if I can see at all) Our (my family's) theory on the blackouts is hypotension, extremely low blood pressure, and so when you get up all the blood pools in your feet and legs and not enough gets up to your brain/head/eyes.It's nice to know I'm not the only one in this situation. :)",

    "question": "I am 15, 5'7\" and 115lbs. I'm usually pretty tired all the time, but I manage throughout the day. Just recently I became EXTREMELY tired. On Wednesday I came home from school and took a 2 hour nap, then went to bed at 8:30 and woke up around 5:50. Thats a little over 11 hours. I thought I would feel refreshed, but the next day I was even more tired. Again came home from school, took a two hour nap, then went to bed around 9:30 and woke up around 5:50. A little over 10 hours. And today thinking I would feel refreshed...I didn't. I was dragging more than you can imagine. And I've had a headache all day. I'm eating pretty healthy, with the occasional junk food, and I've laid off the energy drinks and the caffeinated pop.Another thing, I've been kinda more hungry than usual. I am NOT going through a growth spurt. For some reason thats the answer to every teenagers problem. I can eat something, then 15 minutes later my stomachs growling. I eat like a truck driver, but I don't gain any weight.Can anyone give me ideas as to why I'm tired and hungry a lot?",
