            "answer": "Hi,Since you have mentioned stiff back and sore neck there is a possibility that these symptoms are due to beginning of spondylitic changes in the spine.Nothing can be said for sure without a clinical exam and X ray of the spine.The possibility of stress and anxiety also cannot be ruled out because stress is a predisposing factor for a whole lot of diseases.Hope this helps!",
