    "question": "About a week ago, I noticed that my left top lip had gone a little numb, it also felt like it was creeping into my upper left cheek (kind of a cold feeling).\u00a0\u00a0It went away, but it came back today, same feeling (while I was walking my dog).\u00a0\u00a0I have a history of ovarian cancer (diagnosed 5 years ago) and have had one recurrence.\u00a0\u00a0I still have neuropathy in my toes.\u00a0\u00a0Currently, I am undergoing testing for possible optic nerve problems in my left eye - About three months ago I started losing vision in my left eye.\u00a0\u00a0I am 59 years old and in good health otherwise, low blood pressure, no diabetes, although I am a light smoker.\u00a0\u00a0Could the numb lip have anything to do with the optic nerve??\u00a0\u00a0What could be going on?",
