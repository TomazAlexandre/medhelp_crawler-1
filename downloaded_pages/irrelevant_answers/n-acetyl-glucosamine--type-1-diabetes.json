    "question": "Has anyone tried using n-acetyl glucosamine in conjunction with their normal insulin regamin (UCI study in August showed it might help)?My 10 year old type 1 diabetic son (diagnosed in 2002) has been taking 3 mg of n-acetyl glucosamine each day for 3 months, and we have seen a reduction in the amount of insulin he needs of about 10 % and a \"evening out\" of his blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, he has had celiac antibodies all these 5 years (but no evidence of celiac in his endoscopy) and his TTG IGA antibodies dropped in half over this same time period (from 150+ to 74).Anyone else having this experience?",
