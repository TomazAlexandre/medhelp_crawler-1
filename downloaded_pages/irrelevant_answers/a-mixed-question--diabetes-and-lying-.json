            "answer": "One young adult diabetic told me once that she feels that diabetes is the only disease in which a normal working pancreas is exchanged for guilt. We DO feel like we have done something \"wrong\" when we test and find the number out of our goal range. So guilt happens. And you feel you can't be honest about that \"bad\" number. People who are not diabetic do not realize how difficult it is for us to try to achieve those \"normal\" glucose numbers before every meal.But the reality is that even non-diabetic people have glucose levels out of the normal pre-meal range of 70-126 after they eat meals, and that glucose numbers for all people change constantly.I personally try to encourage people to never view a number as \"good\" or \"bad\" but more as either a level that is OK to leave alone or as a level that needs some adjustment. That is how the non-diabetic person's brain sees those levels. The brain simply adjusts insulin production when levels go too high or too low. Since our pancreas organs don't work, we have do do this adjustment by injecting more insulin or drinking juice if the levels are not in the normal range. So don't see the number as good or bad, but DO see it as NEUTRAL INFORMATION that tells you whether you need to adjust or not since you have to help your body's normal action.If you test fairly often -- certainly once before every meal and ideally once about halfway in between meals, and adjust to high numbers with quick-acting insulin such as your Humalog, the numbers can never go too far out of range, and even if they DO, they can be normalized within a few hours. If your endocrinologist has never given you training on how much insulin your body (each person is different) requires to normalize when you see out-of-whack numbers, then call and ask for this training, for it is essential for each diabetic person to be able to do this on his or her own.Then the key is to test often and adjust, and build this into your daily routine much like brushing your teeth. You will be surprised at how easy it is to normalize the numbers that way. But do work to forget that guilty feeling when a high or low number shows up -- the only thing you can do \"wrong\" is to not adjust when you see those numbers. The numbers are going to continue to go up and down your entire life. Your job is to adjust insulin and juice to normalize them. If you do that, you are doing good things. Don't focus so much on the number, but instead focus on the action that the number generates. Your a1c levels are the real \"report card\" on how well you do this, so don't worry about individual numbers. I have found that my a1c levels are surprisingly normal and steady when I just do this test often and adjust routine.",

            "answer": "Hi! I am a 24 year old diabetic and I understand everything you did. I did the same thing actually. It gets hard when my sugars are always high and i had my mom always getting on me about how high they were. I would just want tomake everyone happy, but didn't realize that iwas really hurting myself. How long have you been diabetic? I have been a diabetic since I was 8. It is still rough. I have 2 kids now and they pretty much keep me going everyday. If it wasn't for them I don't know were I would be today. Diabetes is a bad disease to have and many ppl don't understand that because they don't have the disease, but hang in there and if you need to talk you can email me at ***@****",

            "answer": "I'm pretty sure we've all been there at some point with this disease. Sometimes lying to yourself and others is the only way to get through it! I have had type 1 for 23 years and am 30 years old now and am wishing I would have taken better care of myself 15 years ago. My left eye is bleeding due to retinopathy. It's fixable but VERY scary. I know it is so hard to live with this every day, I know you just want to be a regular carefree teenager like all you friends, I know that no one you know can help you get through it. Please try testing, right now I am testing 3-8 times a day, my a1c is down to 6.3!!!! I have NEVER been more proud of anything in my whole life. Your guardian will probably not be mad at you for lying, my parents never were, they were sad because they couldn't help me. Please try to be honest about you blood sugars, it is the only way to be healthy.",

    "question": "Hello,I have had diabetes for a while now and just recently I have hit a snag that I have an incredibly hard time fixing and I don't know how. About a year or 2 ago I started to lie about my blood sugars to by guardian because they were always high and he would always complain about it. So one day I wanted to give him a break so I lied about it. Then after that it became automatic to where I wouldn't even test and just tell him something I wanted to hear. Now I know this is wrong but I don't want to tell him. I just want to fix it myself and forget about it. Do any of you have any suggestions about how to keep my blood sugars in order, when I go to sleep my blood sugars always rise for no reason, I currently take Humalog, Humalin 70/30 and Humalin N pen.I don't want to be criticized for this, because I just made a mistake and now really need to correct it before it causes me a problem that won't be forgiven.ThanksRob",
