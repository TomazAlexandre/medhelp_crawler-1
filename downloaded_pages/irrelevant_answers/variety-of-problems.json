            "answer": "Hi!You seem to be having a variety of problems but they may have a single cause behind that. The symptoms could be due to compression of multiple spinal nerves, Vit B12 deficiency, vitamin D deficiency, anemia, vaso-vagal attack, low testosterone, lupus and other autoimmune disorders, heavy metal poisoning, multiple sclerosis, hypothyroidism, diabetes and panic attack. It can also be a type of seizure. If there is a headache then it can be benign intracranial hypertension too.Out of these probably the following have been ruled out: Vit B12 deficiency, vitamin D deficiency, anemia, hypothyroidism and diabetes. So, the other mentioned causes need to be looked into.It can also be fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome if all the above mentioned causes are ruled out. Since, you had a fever feeling for 2 weeks, it can also be post viral fatigue syndrome. This is seen after EBV infection, dengue, or other viral illness. There are no magic pills for it. This can be treated patiently with exercise, good diet, work out plans and multivitamins. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables and proteins should be taken along with a multi vitamin supplement. Eat 5-7 small regular meals every day. Drink plenty of water. Do deep breathing exercises. Join a good trainer and start an exercise program that will help you build up stamina. Try doing an activity a day that interests you. Try to remain calm.A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope you get well soon! Good Luck and take care!",

If they have not been ruled out then yes, blood tests for these too need to be performed.If your father has MS, then you should also be tested for it.",

            "answer": "Depends on what the red dots are, bruise or petechiae.Petechiae are pinpoint-sized red dots under the surface of the skin. They can result from autoimmune disorders, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, bone marrow disorders such as leukemia, inflammation of the veins, as a side effect of certain medications.Deficiency of Vitamin B12, folic acid, or Vit K could be the cause of bruising. They could also be fragile spider veins.",

    "question": "I am 21 year old male from Europe and since 2 years I have had problems. I weigh 60KG and height is 179/180cm.I came back from vacation in Thailand and got fever feeling for 2 weeks. Since then I have chronic blocked nose now runny nose, troubling swallowing and lump in throat feeling.I experience that my limbs go numb very easily if I sit in a certain position, if I lean on my elbow for example for hand might feel numb, or when I sit my butt becomes numb. This is way worse than before. Furthermore I feel a like ''needles pricking me'' this feels often painful and also lately feels warm. This I notice multiple times a minute. I also have a lot of broken blood vessels, red dots one mm width. Sunlight/light has gotten more and more painful than before, Wounds are also healing slower. Furthermore I often feel burning feeling in stomach and bowels and I have had a long time where my poop was very soft/diarrhea .I often feel a ''shooting'' pain which I think are near or from the area of my lymphnodes especially in my head (some are swollen to>one CM but do not hurt when I touch). The pain is from the back of my head/near ear and comes from deeper than just the surface (occipital lymphnode area), I don't feel any swollen things there, but there is where I often have a shooting pains for few seconds and it really feels bad that I can't ignore it while I get it, I get this every few days . Other shooting pain is come for below the outer side of my jaw, (cervical lymphnode area).http://medical.cdn.patient.co.uk/images/142.gifHave a numb spot 3x3 cm on my butt/ lower back near (one cm to the left) of my tailbone, feels way more numb than other place on my body.",
