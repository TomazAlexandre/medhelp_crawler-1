    "question": "Recently, about 3 weeks, my feet feel like they are on fire from the inside out. They are swollen, and painful to walk on. They always \"burn\" at the same time, then they will stop at the same time. At first it was a couple of times a day, but now its most of the day and night. Then last night, I woke up with not only my feet feeling like they were on fire, but both of my hands were on fire too. My hands are very uncordinated and weak. The \"burning\" feeling is so intense, its almost unbareable. I am moving from Texas to Missouri next week, and I dont have time to start medical testing here. If you have any tips, advise, clues, or anything about what this may be, PLEASE let me know. Thank you so much.",
