            "answer": "You need to make an appointment with your doctor and talk about the plan to treat your GD. It is very important for your baby that your blood sugar be controlled. Some people can do this with just diet and exercise, some people need oral medication and some insulin for the duration of the pregnancy. Your doctor will advise you to get a glucose meter (or give you one free) and to test your blood sugar at specific times. He will tell you what your target blood sugars should be and what you need to do to achieve that.",
