            "answer": "If you had a thyroid condition either or both doctors would have called and you would have gotten in to seem them, believe me.\u00a0\u00a0Your levels are fine. Even within the normal levels that you quoted, which is a target level for those already diagnosed and treated and not meant as a diagnose level, which is quite a bit higher (OR LOWER).Antibodies are not curable or treatable, nothing can be done about them. Its the thyroid that is treated from the damages of the antibodies.\u00a0\u00a0Antibodies are present in a high proportion of people with chronic thyroiditis, are also present in lesser numbers of people with other thyroid diseases, other autoimmune disorders such as Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis,\u00a0\u00a0pernicious anemia and people that show no evidence of disease. So therefore, thyroid levels are the prevailing diagnose for thyroid, not antibodies.It might be the diabetes causing some or most or all your issues.\u00a0\u00a0My husband was diabetic and he had periodic hair loss and dry skin.",

    "question": "Hi,Please help me interpret these numbers and help me to know what my next step is.I had a thyroid antibody test and it came back at 110.\u00a0\u00a0I hear that normal is 0-3.9 so this seems off-scale. My T4 was 0.9 and TSH was 1.96.\u00a0\u00a0I have recently had dry skin, hair falling out and puffy eyes.\u00a0\u00a0 I've found it hard to lose weight for years, although appearance of\u00a0\u00a0Type 1 diabetes made me lose 12 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0Energy is not great but okay.\u00a0\u00a0Periods are extra-light, extra-long and closer together (23 days) as of late.I can't get another appointment with any endocrinologist in my area.\u00a0\u00a0(They're booked for months and by doctor doesn't seem to return phone calls).\u00a0\u00a0Could someone please help me know what to do rather than have me stew for six months before I can see my doctor?I'm 41 years old, female (obviously), recently diagnosed (two weeks ago) Type 1 diabetic with GAD65 antibodies of 14.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise good health.\u00a0\u00a0I take 6 U Lantus/day plus an occasional bolus of 1-2 U Novolg for meals that might have carbs.\u00a0\u00a0I am normal weight (142 lbs, 5' 7\") and I exercise every day and I try to eat low-carb.Thank you so much!Wendy",
