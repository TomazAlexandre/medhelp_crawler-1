            "answer": "Though there is a link to family members and developing diabetes, your life style is very important in type 2 diabetes. Your \"confession\" of loving sugar is certainly something to be discussed with your physician. Life style changes have been proven to be beneficial in type 2 diabetes so I would take your physician's advice along these lines.Good Luck.",

            "answer": "Having a parent with diabetes does increase your risk of getting diabetes.Being overweight with more weight around the belly area, and high blood pressure, is also another risk factor to getting diabetes.You can minimise your risks by eating healthily and doing some form of exercise - walking is fine or any type of exercise that you enjoy.\u00a0\u00a0Exercising uses up energy and burns calories.All food is converted into glucose in the body, but the energy from sugar and sugar products will increase your blood sugars in the blood stream very quickly and it will drop quickly.The types of foods that are best to be eaten are those that have a slow energy release.\u00a0\u00a0You can still have sugary foods and sugar but cut down.\u00a0\u00a0Sugar does not cause diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It is more complex than that.Diabetes happens when the pancreas stops functioning or produces too little insulin to convert the glucose in the blood stream into energy.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the pancreas produces the insulin, but this is not utilised properly.\u00a0\u00a0You can get a condition called glucose intolerance.There are different names for sugar - anything that ends with \"ose\" is a type of sugar.\u00a0\u00a0For example fructose is sugar in fruit, lactose is milk sugar, glucose, dectrose, etc.Eating fruit is fine because it contains minerals, vitamins as well as fibre.Lifestyle changes as mentioned by other posts definitely helps to reduce your risk of getting diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0And once you have diabetes, exercise will also help to keep your sugar levels much lower by using the energy.Have you noticed any symptoms that is making you think you may have diabetes?Sometimes people do not get any symptoms or they may be very mild that you may not notice or be bothered by them.Feeling tired after a meal, drinking more, having skin problems or cuts that don't heal well, foggy vision after eating too much and especially sugary foods, pins and needles, feeling headachy or nauseas when hungry - any of these may indicate some type of insulin problem.If you have any concerns, ask your doctor to arrange for you to have a glucose test, or a HbA1C blood test.\u00a0\u00a0The home monitoring prick testing kits only will show the sugar levels in the blood at the time that you do the test.\u00a0\u00a0The HbA1C blood test shows the percentage of sugar levels in your blood system over a period of 9-12 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0The glucose sticks to the red corpuscles and they are renewed every 9-12 weeks.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "If you have a family history of diabetes then you have a greater risk of getting it then the person who has no such risk.\u00a0\u00a0But risk does not mean it's set in stone.Try to maintain a good outlook.\u00a0\u00a0Be vigilant through regular testing -- right now would be an ideal time to get tested with a what's called a gluose tolerance test.\u00a0\u00a0An A1C is good for when you have problems, but a glucose tolerance test will tell you if there even an issue or possible issue many years ahead of time.\u00a0\u00a0 But the test has to be with glucose and also insulin monitored.\u00a0\u00a0This is also a great base line to have for future reference.After that you can monitor things using a fasting blood sugar and A1C.The other thing is to be proactive with diet and exercise now.\u00a0\u00a0The worst your OGTT is the more you should start doing now.Knowledge is power!",
