            "answer": "Hello Chris,It sounds like you are doing a lot of the right things. I'm guessing that you may be dealing with diabetes? If so are your blood sugars well controlled? If they are not that would be a significant contributing factor. However as well you are doing in the other areas you probably are right on that also. Or this this just a circulatory issue?I don't think you are asking about medication, am I missing something? If you asking what else you can do to improve your circulatory issues and heal your ulcers. Has your physician tried oxygen therapy? I have seen some great results with this approach. Some physicians beleive in this treatment and others do not.It also never hurts to get a second opinion. It appears as if your physician is leading you down the right path but sometimes that second opinion can add some new light.I am sorry that you are struggling with these frightening issues. I hopeful that all your hardy efforts will pay off. Please let us know how you are doing. I will look forward to your updates.Best of luck and take care,Tuck",
