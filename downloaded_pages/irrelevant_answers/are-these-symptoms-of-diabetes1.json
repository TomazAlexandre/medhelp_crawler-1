            "answer": "Hey Melbidd! I'm a type 1 diabetic, diagnosed 3 years ago when I was 17. All those symptoms you're having were exactly like mine - I also found my vision went awful! I went from perfect 20/20 to not being able to read the milk container (it returned to 20/20 once I got the insulin in me!)I highly suggest you got to your doctor.. Your fasting blood sugar (when you wake up in the morning before eating anything) seems high - usually mine is in the 5.0-5.6 range. High blood sugar over a long period of time can become dangerous - keytones can build up in your blood.Better to be safe and see a doctor! They'll be able to help you get checked out! I'll be thinking about you!",
