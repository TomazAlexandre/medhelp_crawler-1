I did and it was 101.\u00a0\u00a0She told me that if I wanted to conceive that I needed it 90 and lower.\u00a0\u00a0I have been trying to keep up on it but have not gone on a strict diet.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe I should try that if nothing happens this month.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for the info.\u00a0\u00a0She said all of this is in line with pcos.\u00a0\u00a0you don't have to have cysts to have pcos.\u00a0\u00a0have you heard anything like that??",

            "answer": "Tizzy - no,\u00a0\u00a0I haven't heard that much about cysts and PCOS and fertility,\u00a0\u00a0but I have heard another weird fertility trick is to switch sides of the bed with your husband.\u00a0\u00a0If you have one side or another of your ovaries or uterus\u00a0\u00a0that is more fertile,\u00a0\u00a0switching sides of the bed you each sleep on will\u00a0\u00a0give the other side\u00a0\u00a0of your body chance to benefit from the effect of gravity.This again, is for women who have undiagnosed infertility issues.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes,\u00a0\u00a0it's just\u00a0\u00a0a matter of finding the right combination of behaviors.Best wishes with trying to get pregnant -",

    "question": "I just have a comment,\u00a0\u00a0and I think it's very valuable for women who are trying to conceive and have an indefinite diagnosis as to what the fertility problem is.I've seen several examples in my life of blood sugar fluctuations causing infertility.The first,\u00a0\u00a0my best friend who tried for a year and a half to conceive,\u00a0\u00a0the docs didn't quite know why she wasn't except her husband's sperm count was a little low,\u00a0\u00a0went off all white sugars for Easter Lent and conceived.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The diet she followed was for women with gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 She had had trouble with hypoglycemia in the past and chose to give up sugars for lent to feel better.\u00a0\u00a0It was a joyful,\u00a0\u00a0and unexpected outcome,\u00a0\u00a0that she became pregnant during this time.Secondly,\u00a0\u00a0my brother did a science project in high school that involved mice and insulin.\u00a0\u00a0He injected the mice daily with varying low levels of insulin for a period of 3 months and did some tests or other,\u00a0\u00a0based on unstable blood sugar levels,\u00a0\u00a0I forget what.\u00a0\u00a0This was a cage of 26 mice,\u00a0\u00a0evenly divided between males and females,\u00a0\u00a0ALL HOUSED TOGETHER.\u00a0\u00a0After the Science Fair project was completed,\u00a0\u00a0he kept the mice in the same container as pets and the females all became pregnant within weeks.\u00a0\u00a0There had been no pregnancies (a really wild occurrance,\u00a0\u00a0in a cage full of mice!) during the insulin injections.It's just a thought,\u00a0\u00a0I think there's something to it,\u00a0\u00a0best wishes everyone in their journey to have a child.",
