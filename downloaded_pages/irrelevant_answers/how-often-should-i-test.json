            "answer": "Diet and exercise are very important.\u00a0\u00a0 For diet, you need to limit carbs and sugars.\u00a0\u00a0I was told 3-4 carb servings per meal...2 of them starch, but whole grain is preferred.\u00a0\u00a0A carb serving is 15g.Obviously, eliminate sugar as much as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Pepperidge Farm has a decent low carb bread\u00a0\u00a09 g per slice.An afternoon and evening snack, 1-2 carb servings\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04 oz oj or a small orange, small apple, half banana\u00a0\u00a0 each of those would be a carb serving.Whole fruit vs juice.Small portions...you can check out the ADA or the Joslin site for help, although the ADA for sure seems to want mostly to sell stuff.\u00a0\u00a0Check out books at the library.\u00a0\u00a0Start reading labels for carb/sugar content.Hopefully, all this will help and you can get your numbers lowered despite the doc.\u00a0\u00a0I would also explain to her that it helps you monitor yourself and that you would appreciate it if she would prescribe the test strips for you ... you are, after all, paying her.",

            "answer": "I am a 5'6\", 49yr old female who was diagnosed with Type II in January of 2006.\u00a0\u00a0It runs in my family, and there have been many deaths and amputations because of it.\u00a0\u00a0Fortunately, my doctor belongs to a hospital with a diabetes center, so I was able to get a lot of information.\u00a0\u00a0I have also been online a lot gathering information.When I got diagnosed, I was 212lbs, and am now down to about 169lbs My A1C was 6.5, and is now down to normal ranges.\u00a0\u00a0At this time, if I were to be tested with no past testing, I am NOT considered diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0YEAH!!!!\u00a0\u00a0What I have done is, been very careful about what I eat, and the amount of it.\u00a0\u00a0I have 45 carbs per main meal, consisting of a protein, a vegetable (not including corn or peas), a carb (which can include peas or corn), a fruit and calcuim.\u00a0\u00a0If I want something like ice cream or chocolate, I eat it early in the day, but only in very small quantities......1/4 cup of ice cream.\u00a0\u00a0I do not eat that kind of food often, but when I get a craving for it, I eat it.\u00a0\u00a0I was told it is better to eat what you crave in small amounts, than to not eat it at all and go nuts about it.At this time, I do not formally exercise as I am physically very active, but when the winter comes, I have a motorized treadmill, tension bands, and weights to\u00a0\u00a0keep my body fit.I don't use sugar, but splenda, as the other sugar substitues taste horrible. I totally enjoy soda, so I drink caffine free diet pepsi and a kool ade like substance from 4C, which is similiar to Crystal Lite, but again, has Splenda.I too, take Januvia, but only 5mg daily.\u00a0\u00a0My body is suseptible to medications, therefore, I don't require large doses of anything.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before being prescribed it, I would get hypoglycemic on a daily basis, and couldn't do anything for more than an few hours, and then would have to rest.\u00a0\u00a0I even collapsed in our local grocery store, and had to have an ambulance.\u00a0\u00a0Very embarassing.Don't give up.\u00a0\u00a0I do agree about finding another Dr. if possible. There is a lot of information online than can help you learn about what you have and how to take care of yourself.Regarding testing, I do it every other day, because my sugar is currently under control.\u00a0\u00a0Before, I would do it twice a day, as suggested by \"OFTEN\".I hope this helps.",
