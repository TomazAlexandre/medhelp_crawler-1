    "question": "So my girlfriend told me that last night at 4am (she was studying late) she went to the bathroom and went to go pee. She said that the toilet was filled with dark red blood or atleast something red. But the only probable guess is blood right? She said there was nothing else in the toilet or anything, there was enough light to see and she was not seeing anything. She also said that she did not feeling any burning or pain anywhere even till today (4/15/10). She eats healthy and does not have anything near diabetes to worry about since she does not eat much sugar and such.My girlfriend even said she wiped but there was no blood... So she wiped again and there was only a small amount of blood. (She also said she THINKS the blood maybe from the \"pee hole\" not the vagina. She said she COULD BE WRONG)I am concerned because it may be a health risk and I would not want anything to happen to her, also... is it possible she may be pregnant?We had sex on sunday but of course we did use protection; but to also add on, this could not be a sign of pregnancy right? I have researched it or not hard enough to find any articles about peeing out alot of blood?Spotting is only minimal amount of blood but could it be possible?Her period is to come i think.... next week? Im not sure.",
