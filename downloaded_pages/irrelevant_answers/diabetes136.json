I noticed that when i started having 200s for a while, and then started controlling it again, my sugar would be 90-100 and i would have the same symptoms of hypoglycemia because my body was so used to my sugars being high. I am type I, have been for 19 years. Dont know if that helps any, good luck. Hope he gets to feeling better.Christina",

            "answer": "My wife became a type 1 diabetic at the age of 3 (1951); her 6 year older sister one year later became a type 1 diabetic (1952) - they both weren't suppose to live past the age of about 13. My wife passed at the age of 50. She could have taken better care of her self like her older sister as we just buried her this week at the age of 72. I don't know of any diabetic who has lived as long as her. There were doctors who would drive or fly hundreds of miles to interview her because she was so disciplined with her meals and exercise. Who do you know that could fit back into their wedding dress after 50 years? She did! If we all could be as disciplined as Barbara, we would live a long and happy life...she sure did!-------------------------------I have a blog dedicated to promote better health in reversing heart disease and living with diabetes.
