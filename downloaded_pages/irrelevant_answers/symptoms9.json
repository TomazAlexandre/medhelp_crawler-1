            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.The usual symptoms of diabetes are\u00a0\u00a0frequent urination, thirst, blurred vision, feeling tired, cuts/bruises that are slow to heal, frequent infections and numbness and tingling in the distal extremities. Some of these match up with the symptoms that you are experiencing. However, your symptoms are also common with many other ailments. I would suggest seeing your doctor. Your doctor can examine you and evaluate your history\u00a0\u00a0and lab values to find what is most likely causing your symptoms.Good luck. I hope you are feeling better soon.Cathy",
