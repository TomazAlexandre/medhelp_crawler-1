            "answer": "It sounds to me like he may be caught in a cycle where an allergic reaction (or another condition) may be causing the rash which is causing the high blood sugars which are keeping the rash from healing.\u00a0\u00a0His dermatologist and endocrinologist will need to work together on this one.\u00a0\u00a0The blood sugars cannot continue to be this high no matter what is causing them so the diabetes regimen may need to change for now.\u00a0\u00a0If he gets his blood sugars back to normal the rash may heal.\u00a0\u00a0Also, there are some medications used to treat rashes that may cause high blood sugars but I am certain the doctor would have discussed that.I am not sure if he has Type 1 or Type 2 but there is a condition that several people with Type 1 diabetes also have called Celiac Sprue and one of the symptoms is a skin rash but other than that, I have not heard of diabetes causing a rash. I wish I had more to offer.\u00a0\u00a0Please keep us updated.\u00a0\u00a0Have a wonderful holiday season.",

            "answer": "I'm also not an MD, but I wonder -- especially with the dangerously high blood sugars -- about yeast (candida) infections.\u00a0\u00a0Normally, yeast infections thrive in warm moist body areas, but they can spread and unfortunately, the systems of an uncontrolled diabetic are quite pleasant for yeast to grow.It's important for your dad to work with a doc who's very well versed in diabetes and perhaps that doc will also consult with other specialists.I hope he'll find some relief soon.\u00a0\u00a0Whatever he is willing to do to gradually & steadily bring his blood sugars under better control will also help him a tremendous amount.",

    "question": "My father has had insulin dependent diabetes for 20 plus years, he is in his 70's now.\u00a0\u00a0Within the past year he has developed a rash which has gradually spread to all his body with intense itching.\u00a0\u00a0Now his blood sugars are running in the 400-500's. His diet has not changed nor has he changed any products in the house. He goes to his endocrinologist on a regular basis with no helpful results, and he has been to a dermitologist without any help. The rash just continues.\u00a0\u00a0The pharmacists state this could be contributing to his high blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0My next move is to try to get him appointment at the U. of Michigan hospital for evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone had any experience with severe rash with diabetes?Very concerned daughter,sltomas",
