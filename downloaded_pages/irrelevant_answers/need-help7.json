            "answer": "You don't include some important imformation in your question. How did you reduce it from 198 to 100? With diet and exercise? Medication? What did your doctor suggest? Perhaps most important at your age, do you know if you are Type 1 or Type 2? That would make a huge difference in treatment! Type 1 requires insulin, and yes it is for your life unless they find a cure.If you are Type 2 you may be able to control your diabetes for awhile with reduced carb intake, exercise and weight control. If your numbers continue to be high or start to go up later on, then you will need an oral medication. Talk to your doctor, make sure which type you are (There is also LADA/1.5 which is a slow onset type 1 where you might do ok on meds for awhile but need insulin in months or a couple years). Learn about proper diet. In addition to fasting you want to keep your two hour after meal number under 140. Get a meter and test to see how different foods affect you.",

            "answer": "You need to have your doctor test you for antibodies. If you have antibodies you are type 1, if not you are type 2. Some signs of being type 1 would be normal weight, another autoimmune disease such as thyroid and not responding to oral meds, or only responding for awhile. But only the antibody test will tell you for sure.I don't know anything about herpes or if it's related to diabetes, ask your doctor.",
