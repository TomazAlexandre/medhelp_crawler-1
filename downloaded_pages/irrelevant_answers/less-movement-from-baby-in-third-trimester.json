Iv noticed his movements have slowed down and some days hardly feel anything. Apparently they spend most of their time sleeping now aswell especially as they have little space.",

    "question": "Anyone having less movement from their babies? I'm 34w4d and my baby girl sure is strong but doesn't move as much throughout the day. She's a soccer player at night still! I know I've read the space gets smaller the bigger they get so that could be the reason. Plus I know she's good because I have to do twice a week monitoring on her due to gestational diabetes :/. I still get worried something's up when she doesn't move.",
