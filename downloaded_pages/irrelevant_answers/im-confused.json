            "answer": "You don't say where you live. If you live in the U.S. I'm assuming that was your HA1C? He did labwork and that test checks your average for 2-3 months? You should always ask for a copy of your labwork and an explanation. A good A1C is under 7.0 although some doctors will say up to 7.0 is good. For your daily readings you want to be under 100 if possible at your fasting test and then you want to stay under 140 two hours after your meals. I wouldn't worry about the A1C until you go for your next test. Concentrate on the numbers on your meter.",

            "answer": "Your numbers indicated glucose out of control and you need to pay attention to what your doctor says to you. Go back and consult with your doctor so you can understand what you need to do in order to control and manage your glucose levels before they get way of hand. If you Google \"diabetes complications\", I guarantee you will not like what you read.Your home meter [test kit] could also be whacked giving you inaccurate test results. Not all meters are accurate as I stated in my Medhelp Forum July 19, 2009\u00a0\u00a0post, \"Tighter Standard Needed on Diabetes Meters\". To back this claim, in September 2008 Consumer Reports, a US based nonprofit organization, test results showed \"The OneTouch UltraMini [Johnson & Johnson], the only meter to score excellent overall, also scored the highest for consistency.\" against, I believe, five other top name brand meters. http://tinyurl.com/l336aqOK, to the nitty gritty of your posted numbers.

You're not doing so good buddy.\"The meter I use usally reads, from 112 somedays to 177 on others, one time it was in the 200's \"There are two times to test: after fasting [prandial] for 8-10 hours. Meaning you do NOT eat or drink anything except water for this time period; And, 2-3 hours after eating [postprandial] when glucose [blood sugar] is at its highest point. The first is to get a baseline to work off, the second to see what foods you consumed does to your glucose level and what you can and should not eat.\"where do I need to be using his # \"Huh? Are you asking what numbers are considered normal ranges?

As Zoe stated some doctors like to see postprandial of <140 mg/dl or 7.0 mmol/l but in most people this is rarely obtainable.
