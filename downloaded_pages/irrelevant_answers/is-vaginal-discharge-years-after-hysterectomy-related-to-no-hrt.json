    "question": "(Part 3 of 3)Has anyone else experienced this? Could it be related to the fact that I am not taking any type of hormone replacement? What type or kind is recommended these days? I do not want to take any form of synthetic type. I don\u2019t have much faith in many types of traditional medicine. I have watched both parents die from the effects of cancer treatments from radiation and chemotherapy. The physicians in both my parents cases were not willing to explore other alternative methods of treatment. My parents were treated by different medical facilities in different states. I am also very aware of the relationships that exist between the pharmaceutical companies and doctors. Not to mention how our own government doesn\u2019t protect us from toxic chemicals that are known to be present in so many of the products consumers use.I believe in natural healing. Please provide me with some insight on where to go for these types of therapy. Thank you so much!(Part 3 of 3)",
