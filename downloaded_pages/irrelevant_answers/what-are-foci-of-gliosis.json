            "answer": "Hi,As I have already said, any area of brain tissue destruction can lead to gliosis. The causes that I have stated above are the most well defined causes of foci of gliosis. Other nonspecific causes like migraine, small vessel disease and demyelination are possibilities. The final diagnosis depends on the combination of examination, history and investigations. Investigation alone cannot be used to diagnose a diseaseRegards",
