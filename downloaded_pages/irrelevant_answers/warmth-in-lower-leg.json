            "answer": "I just developed that sensation also. I had a hip arthroscopy to fix a torn labrum in my hip 6 months ago, but then during the 3 months of crutches/cane/rehab developed a bulging disc in my lumbar spine. I had gained a bit of weight during all this and when the heat sensation started I became paranoid that my recent weight gain had led to Type II Diabetes (which is why Googling your symptoms may not always be a great idea). This was ruled out by my PCP, and when I went back to my physiatrist she said that the sensation, which had now also manifested in my knee, was almost definitely due to the bulging disc impinging on a nerve. Hope this helps.",

    "question": "I, too, am experiencing a sudden warming sensation in the outer lower left leg. It doesn't hurt, but it is driving me crazy with worry. I'm going to see a doctor this week. This started a couple of weeks ago, not long after I started going back to the gym to work out. I also sit for long periods at work which could be a contributing factor.This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/294793\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/294793</a>.",
