            "answer": "There can be many causes, including serious ones like diabetes and thyroid disease.\u00a0\u00a0Most guys ignore any other symptoms they have until they start having symptoms with erections, so there is nothing unusual about seeing the doctor for ED.\u00a0\u00a0Get checked out with your PCP, and if necessary, referral to a urologist specializing in ED.In general, if you smoke, stop because it ruins your vascular system and therefore erections.\u00a0\u00a0Eat a healthy diet, not one high in the wrong fats and carbs and sugar.\u00a0\u00a0If you wear out your pancreas, you get type 2 diabetes, and diabetes is very bad for erections.Exercise vigorously, such as running.\u00a0\u00a0Start with walking if that's all you can do.Take L-argimine to ramp up your testosterone and vascular system and make the exercise even more effective.Occasionally it is psychological, especially if you have a very religious background that says sex is dirty.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that hasn't happened to you, but I'm sure it can be overcome.",
