I expect to have cataract surgery in October so there will be one more examination (I suppose a pre-op exam) before surgery. I shall report back to you all in December with the final outcome.",

    "question": "Every 7 to 8 weeks my left eye becomes cloudy to the extent that I cannot read (even a STOP sign on the road).The condition lasts for about 5 days then disappears until the almost regular cycle. This has been going on for a year.One specialist diagnosed a cataract and proposed surgery. However after this first time and the fact that the condition went away I went back to my ophthalmologist and he sent me to a specialist who ordered an MRI and a cerotic artery test. Nothing amiss. Finally I was sent to a retina specialist from Wills Hospital and he confirmed that I appear to have some form of intermittent cataract but that my retina and eye was otherwise in good condition. His opinion was that I should have this cataract removed only when it becomes a persistent problem.So I am considering cataract surgery in October but am worried about this \"unusual\" condition. I can find no reference to this in any literature. It would seem that \"intermittent cataract\" is an oxymoron but that is what I have. Any ideas or clarifications would be appreciated. I am 71 and am in good physical shape, no medical problems.",
