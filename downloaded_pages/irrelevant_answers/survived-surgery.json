            "answer": "Hey, you guys. I went to the GI doctor yesterday. He is supposed to be finding out why i am having stomach issues (constipation), but instead is more intrested in my weight loss and seems to think I have some sort of diabetes. He looked at my blood work from the records my PCP sent him. The first thing out of his mouth was \"ketones\" (sp?), said they were huge. I told him i had never heard about it from other doctors. He is doing more blood work and of course have to have the endoscopy (sp?) later this month. I told him I had already been tested for diabetes insipidus and diabetes in general. (Glucuose test) and everything comes back normal. He said there are many tests to do to check for diabetes and many forms of diabetes. Taking my symptoms, weight loss, constant urination (dehydration at times from constant urination), always getting thirsty in the middle of the night leads him to suspect some sort of diabetes. Seeing as we have ruled out anorexia for the weight loss, I eat constantly, but never feel full, like i have an empty stomach. I also have night sweats. I do get tired of the anorexia questions, my husband, sisters, nephews have all been questioned on my eating..seriously...My dad was diabetic so that is why he suspects diabetes. I am just hoping i get some answers from any specialist at this point, i do not care if it is diabetes or cancer....He did notice the mass in my pelvis area and stated i needed to get that out. I told him my PCP is supposedly working on it. Remember, it is not a place that they can just go in an biopsy, it would be a complex surgery do to its location. They said it is in a place called the zuckerland. Anyway, that is my update, tomorrow i go get the results from last weeks surgery and the stitches removed....Again, thanks for your prayers.....I will keep you updated....",

            "answer": "Okay finally got some answers. NO CANCER FOUND ON THE TWO LYMPH NODES, AND GLAND.The diagnosis for the calcified ligament was \"Eagle Syndrome\".The diagnosis for the swelling of the submandibular gland was \"sialadenitis\".See i knew i was not crazy complaining about the pain that they could never find reason for from MRI, CT scans and ultrasound.I have not spoke with my PCP about either yet. I keep telling them i have some sort of autoimmune disease that NO BLOOD TEST will catch. I guess i am grateful i did not just listen to them and give up or allow myself to be put on an anti-depressant for what i am sure the ENT dr. at one point thought was all in my head.",

    "question": "Okay, finally have the mood to post.I survived my surgery last Thursday!! They ended up removing my submandibular gland, a lymph node that was piggybacking on it, and a ligament (runs from back ear to lower jaw) that was calcified. The lymph node and ligament they just happend to discover while they were removing the submandibular gland. It was not a tumor they removed, they do not know what it is they removed until they get the biopsy results back this Thursday. The doctor does not seem to think it is cancer, but was honest in not knowing what it was. I am hoping to find out why the submandibular gland was enlarged (no obstruction found), why the lymph node was enlarged and stuck to the gland, and why the heck my ligament became calcified...The incision looks good, not redness, but the swelling has not gone down yet, i am hoping soon...Hurts to yawn, swallow, and eat. Right now surviving on pudding and jello. I did get nausea and diarreha after surgery but they gave me anit-nausea and kept me on the fluids. I still feel like ****, but really hoping that once the swelling goes down i will feel some what normal. Right now, I can not open my mouth wide and my smile is crooked......I only take the pain medication once a day because i do have a 14 year old who still needs to be driven to his activities.It is strange because all this was missed by the surgeon back in May when he did the CT scan. He told me there was not anything he could see that would cause my pain. I think he said after surgery that the blood vessels were hiding everything. I will let you guys know what the results are once i know. Right now heading to the GI doctor for stomach issues.Thanks for your prayers....",
