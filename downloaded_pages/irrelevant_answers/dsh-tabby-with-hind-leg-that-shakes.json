            "answer": "Hi Elisa, is you're kitty one with a small peaked nose? (ie: persians or bulldogs, pugs etc.) they will tend to snore as this 'break' in their noses causes some obstruction, no not really anything to worry over...unless it becomes alot worse and perhaps surgery would open up the nasal passages a bit.As for the shaking leg...that I can't tell you much about, have you spoken to a Vet?Why don't you post this question on our Vet Forum?Go to the right of this screen and scroll way down until you get to a section calledEXPERT RELATED FORUMs that will lead you to a Vet forum and I think they could tell you what this could be...good luck",

            "answer": "I agree with Opus.You need to see a vet. Diabetes causes the shaking of the legs but it needs to be ruled out by an expert, and I'm not even sure that young cats would have this illness. Maybe some x-rays and blood work will give you the answers you so need.Good Luck!",
