            "answer": "Retrograde Ejaculation\"This is a fairly unusual condition in which the semen enters the bladder during orgasm, rather than exiting from the penis. There are several conditions which can cause retrograde ejaculation; diabetes, prostate surgery, bladder surgery, use of certain medications (high blood pressure, mood disorder medication.)Retrograde Ejaculation occurs because these conditions weaken the nerves that would normally regulate the bladder. Men with spinal cord injuries may also have retrograde ejaculation.Common cold medications can sometimes be used to correct the problem. In addition, your physician may put you on medication to decrease the acidic quality of your urine, preventing the urine from killing the sperm may be prescribed. After ejaculation, the sperm is removed from the urine and may then be used with IUI or an IVF procedure.\"*Info from the Resolve website",
