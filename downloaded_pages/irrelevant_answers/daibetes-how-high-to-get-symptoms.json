            "answer": "Hello,with fasting BS in the 150 range you are already diabetic.Do you have any idea how high you go 2 hours after eating?With a HA1C of 6.1 your average blood sugar is already in the close to 140.\u00a0\u00a0Normal HBA1C should be < 5.0.\u00a0\u00a0Fasting blood sugar should be < 99.\u00a0\u00a02 hour after eating should be <120 (but ideally back to fasting level).Average blood sugar = (HBA1c x 35.6)-77.3To prevent diabetic complications it is really important to control blood sugar early and agressively.I believe that your doctor is wrong about not giving you medication. Though he is right to ask you to lose weight, exercise, avoid high carb foods.If your blood sugar is already in the 300s it is too late!\u00a0\u00a0You will be having major problems with your health and they won't all be reversible.Pleae look for a second opinion.",

            "answer": "I read your post with interest and wondered to myself on several things you mentioned. Using the ADA [American Diabetes Association] A1c online calculator, and one from DiabetesPro, your 6.1% A1c equates to an eAG [estimated daily Average Glucose] of 128 mg/dl, a tad into diabetes land. This would not warrant oral diabetes medications.If you are overweight your doctor is correct, losing weight will most likely lower your bs levels hopefully to normal. At times a patient doesn't quite hear everything a doctor says. I don't feel any doctor, unless he's a quack, would tell a patient \"you don't get symptoms until your blood sugar runs in the 300's.\" Having constant levels at 300 mg/dl one can expect MAJOR diabetes symptoms to begin -diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy, cardio issues. Perhaps this is what he meant. If not, a callback to his office for clarification is warranted.\"My fasting BS are usually in the 150 range.\"Fasting before eating or drinking any colored liquids for 8-10 hours, right? What are your bedtime levels? Going to be with high levels will affect your morning levels. If bedtime levels are within normal ranges several things need to be looked at closer; your thyroid and your liver, the latter to see why its dumping excess glycogen.Preventive care is most important; lose excess weight, exercise 30-60 mins daily, and eat a proper diabetic diet free of sugary foods and liquids and low in carbs. It's your current lifestyle that has put into this place. If you change it you have a good chance of being non-diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck -",

    "question": "My fasting BS are usually in the 150 range. My last HA1C was 6.1. My doctor won't do anything but tell me to lose weight. How high does your BS need to be to go on the pills for lowering it? I get many of the diabetes symptoms (frequent urination, itching, etc) & my dr. says you don't get symptoms until your blood sugar runs in the 300's. Is it possible he is wrong & I should be on a pill?",
