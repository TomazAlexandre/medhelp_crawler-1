            "answer": "Hi Me,You urine appears light straw color so you are probably not dehydrated which can cause cloudy urine. Do you have additional symptoms such as burning upon urination, difficultly starting your stream or an interrupted stream? Do you have a slight discharge after urination? Do you have pain in your pelvic region? Do you have an elevated temperature?I'm sorry I don't know your history. A frequent cause of cloudy urine is a UTI (Urinary Tract Infection). If you are a male then UTIs are not common.Water soluble vitamins can cause cloudy urine such as all the B vitamins and Vitamin C. Some medications can also cause urine to be cloudy as can pregnancy or diabetes.Kidney Stones can also cause cloudy urine but believe me if you had stones you would certainly know it. There are extremely painful.I urge you to consult your medical provider. If you are a male, have cloudy urine more than once or other SX (symptoms) you should be checked for a UTI or other conditions that may cause cloudy urine. Actually this applies to females also. We females are more prone to UTIs and they are not as uncommon.Stay well hydrated. If you do have a UTI cranberry juice is a home remedy that is often effective. Hope this info has been helpful.I wish you the best and hope you'll keep us updated.Take Care,~Tuck",
