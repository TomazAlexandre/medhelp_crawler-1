    "question": "so im not sure if i should be worried. every time i intake any sugar what so ever, such as eating a cookie or taking a sip of sweet tea, in about 30 to 45 minutes my body starts reacting weird. my symptoms generally include, short rapid breathing, my heart rate sky rockets, my vision becomes blurred, my fingers and toes become numb, i acquire a headache, i grow pale and have the inability to focus on anything such as the paper in front of me. lately ive been extremely tired although nothing in my routine has changed and i just simply appear unhealthy. what could be causing this? im at no risk of obesity and run 3 to 7 miles at least twice a week.",
