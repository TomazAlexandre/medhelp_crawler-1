            "answer": "For what it's worth when my ex started suboxone she stayed with me.she was skin and bones when she went into detox,maybe 110-115 at 5'4'. When she came out within like maybe a month or so she was up to 160,then by 4 months she tolled in at 170. Now i know she was malnourished due to the addiction and withdrawls but never to 170. 4years later she is still on sub (she was as far as i know yet in march),but she has dropped to maybe 135-140......I have my suspicions she is using again,but her memory is shot also. Honest i have to have her write down the times i will pick up the kids,which day etc. She can't remeber anything at all. i think it not only was ingesting truck loads of oxy etc, but since the sub it is worse.So the wait gain maybe sub related but i never saw the swelling in her feet. The big thing is the emotional issues and the lack of memory. , Jim",

            "answer": "I'm not on sub or any of those meds, but I had considerable swelling of my ankles and feet a few weeks go.\u00a0\u00a0My wife, being a nurse, immediately had me get a doctor appointment.\u00a0\u00a0As I recently (3 months ago) had a pacemaker inplanted, her concern was that it was cardiac related (it is a sign of congestive heart failure) and I'm also a diabetic and there was some concern there on her part..though my blood sugar has been fine and my overall A1C number is right where it's supposed to be.I went to the doc (well, in this case a PA as my doc was booked up and she checked out all my recent cardiac studies which showed that I have a \"normal\"heart for a 57 year old with no signs of any serious condition that would leadto the swelling.\u00a0\u00a0She prescribed me (can't think of the name\" a diuretic which led to a lot of peeing and ultimately all the swelling went down and hasn't returned..we don't know what caused it.. Doc suspected it could be related toLyme disease (which I also have...picture of perfect health, eh?).At any rate, I'd suggested getting to your doctor or a doctor (urgent care, whatever) and get it checked out.I ultimately lost around 10lbs of precious bodily fluids.Jim",

In other words, you aren't diabetic, it's just a reaction. It's still JUST as dangerous.Again, I'm not 100% sure here I'm thinking of the right thing here, I'll take some time to look through all the stuff I've been dumping into a file and see if I can find the reference.
