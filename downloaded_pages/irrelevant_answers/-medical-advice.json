            "answer": "Glucose testing is a part of the process. Unfortunately now days after labs take your blood they no linger give you anything to help you make until you can get something. The test is to determine if your wife has gestational diabetes. This usually goes away once the baby is born. If I were you I read up on it as much as I can. But if you are truly concerned about the Doctors handling of your wife then you should seek another doctor and yes the test is done after you have fasted. I took the test twice this time and both times it came back negative for me. Good Luck.",

            "answer": "Oh I hate glucose tolerance tests! Not only is fasting (especially while pregnant) a pain but the stuff they have you drink is gross.That said, the test is normal and necessary. It is usually done around 28 weeks gestation but can be done earlier if there is a family history of diabetes or if the woman has had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy.If your doctor did not run this test and gestational diabetes went untreated, it could cause great harm (even death) to your unborn baby\u00a0\u00a0and put your wife at risk for certain complications during delivery. The baby would become VERY large and have to be delivered by c-section. After birth the baby might suffer from very low blood sugar for the first few days after birth while its pancreas adjusted.It is VERY important that gestational diabetes be detected and treated. While I don't agree with the lab letting her drive herself home (she should have been told that hypoglycemia is a common result of this testing and to have someone drive her) to not do this test would be\u00a0\u00a0malpractice on the part of the doctor.Normally, educating patients about what to expect from a test is the nurse or medical assistant's job (it is part of what they teach us to do in nursing school). Most physicians don't do that part. I would definitely let the doctor KNOW what happened and that you are NOT happy about it so it can be addressed with his or her office staff.Definitely read up on gestational diabetes (do an search online, there are many good sites, including the American Diabetes Association and National Institutes of Health) and if you possibly can, go with your wife to her appointment for her diabetes education. With a consistent carbohydrate diet and exercise, your wife's gestational diabetes can be controlled and the risks to her and the baby minimized.Best wishes to you and your family.",

            "answer": "They should have monitored your wife better following the test, but like th others said it is a really important test.The test has showed she has gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0COntrolling her blood sugar is critical for her and the baby. So you must follow the doctor's advice.\u00a0\u00a0Do read up very well.\u00a0\u00a0She should also be careful with diet and avoid to much carbohydrates.I had gestational diabetes with my daughter and ended up on insulin for the duration of the pregnancy, along with diet.\u00a0\u00a0I will be on insulin again in case I get pregnant again.All will be fine if you manage this well.;",
