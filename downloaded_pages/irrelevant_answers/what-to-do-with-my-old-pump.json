            "answer": "Hi Meredith,I think it's great you want to help others by donating your used insulin pump so that someone else may have a chance to improve their diabetes care. I'm sure there are many charitable organizations who would take you up on your offer. One of them may be S.U.G.A.R (Support Unlimited Guaranteed for Appliances Required, Assistance for diabetic devices). This organization \"serves the people of Canada by donating diabetic devices to individuals who are unable to afford them thus enhancing the quality of life they richly deserve.\" Their website is http://www.sugarcharity.org/Thank you and take care!",

    "question": "I have been a pump therapy patient for about four and a half years.\u00a0\u00a0I recently upgraded from a MiniMed 522 to a 722, and now have a pump sitting around with no use for it.\u00a0\u00a0I was wondering if there were any charitable organizations that could accept a used pump as a donation, or what others had done with their used pumps.\u00a0\u00a0I certainly do not want someone to start pump therapy against (or without)the advice of a physician, but I also know that price can be very prohibitive for someone who could benefit from pump therapy.Thanks in advance for any suggestions.",
