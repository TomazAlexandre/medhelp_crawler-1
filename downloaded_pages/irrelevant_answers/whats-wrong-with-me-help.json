            "answer": "I think you need to go to a doctor. Diabetes isn't only something that overweight people get, I've seen plenty of people who were fit except for having diabetes. You might not have it, but since your symptoms are happening repeatedly over a span of time, it's not worth taking the chance. In some cases, when you get the treatment is important, so if it's really worrying you, make an appointment with a doctor. In just about any city, there are cheap clinics and things like that, if your family doesn't want to take it seriously.",

    "question": "Hey. I'm Hannah and I'm 17. Ever since I was about 12 I have noticed something kind of strange. I first noticed it when I was eating a bag of white chocolate chips (I was 12). I felt like i was sweating when I was about not even halfway into the bag. My face and neck seriously felt like sweat in the inside but there was no moisture on my face? It has been happening ever since. I looked it up and google came up with Diabetes. My whole family on my dads side has diabetes but when I asked them they said its only for over weight people? I weight 128Ib. Maybe they were just trying to not make me worry by saying that but it keeps happening, and whats even stranger my diet keeps changing. I HATE water but now I'm drinking it by the glass fulls. Anyone know whats going on?",
