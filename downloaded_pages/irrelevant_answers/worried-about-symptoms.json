            "answer": "While your symptoms DO sound suspiciously like diabetes (fatigue, thirst, and frequent urination because of all the liquids you are drinking due to thirst are classic symptoms of diabetes), and neuropathy is a common complication diabetes, your doctor probably is saying you don't have diabetes because glucose tests probaby have come back normal. I would encourage you to ASK YOUR DOCTOR if he has done a glucose test, and if so, what the number was. If the number for a fasting glucose test was 70-126 (if you are in America), then your glucose is in the normal range. If it was tested in a random bloodwork that happened after a meal, the numbers may be higher than this, and most doctors do not think a person is diabetic unless their AFTER MEAL glucose rises above about 145, although this after meal glucose can vary fairly greatly.So find out what your glucose was when tested. If your doctor is saying you are not a diabetic, but has NOT tested your glucose levels (this is done in a simple blood test in the lab), then I would insist that he do the labwork to see what your glucose levels are. Ideally, this test should be done first thing in the morning before eating anything in order to truly get an idea of what your normal glucose level is. An even better test is a glucose tolerance test, which will show what your glucose levels do after you consume large amounts of carbohydrate.We wish you the best. Good luck to you.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your reply. I have not had a glucose test done by my current doctor. I had one several years ago. I find it odd that he just assumes I don't have Diabetes. That may be the case but, I don't understand what would make him so sure I don't have it without the glucose test.",

            "answer": "Then I would make haste and have the glucose test done, for your symptoms do seem pretty standard for diabetes. If this IS the problem, then getting it under control soon may stop any damage to your nerves before the problem gets worse, and it may actually improve your symptoms. I would DEMAND a glucose test if it has indeed been several years since this was done. Doctors can make mistakes and the assumption that this is not diabetes could be wrong.",

    "question": "Hello, Thank you for taking the time to look at my question. I am a 27 year old female.\u00a0\u00a0I am very concerned about some symptoms I have been having. Starting about three months ago I started getting numb feet this has progressed to being a constant numbness and pins and needles feeling sometimes all over my feet or in different feet sometimes radiating to my knees.\u00a0\u00a0I have also been dizzy on an almost daily basis for about 2 months. I get so tired somtimes out of nowhere I sometimes can't drive for fear I will fall asleep. I feel thirsty alot and urinate alot although I am sure the two coralate :) I feel hungary all the time even after I eat.I have had many tests done cardiologist found nothing, had blood work for thyroid nothing there I am now seeing a Neurologist had an MRI nothing there. I had an EMG done for the numbness in my feet he thinks I have Neuropathy I haven't recieved the results yet. I asked my PCP before he sent me to the Neurologist could this be Diabetes and he said no, you don't have Diabetes, so matter of factly. I have never been tested for this would there be a reason that he automaticly thinks I do not have Diabetes? I am wondering why he wouldn't even test me for it. It does run in my family my grandfather and alot of others although my parents do not have it. Should I Prusue a Diabetes test? Im I right in thinking that some of my symptoms seem like symptoms of Diabetes? Should I seek another doctors opinion or go back to that doctor. Or maybe he is right and I don't have Diabetes. Thank you again for your time!",
