            "answer": "Hi!If the burning sensation is in scalp and legs only then it could be due to multiple pinched nerves. You will need nerve conduction studies, EMG and MRI for confirmed diagnosis. Peripheral neuropathies too could be the cause and occur due to diabetes, lupus and thyroid problems. Treatment is usually conservative with manual therapy, physiotherapy and pain killers. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
