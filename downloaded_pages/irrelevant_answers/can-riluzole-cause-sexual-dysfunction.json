            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Well, riluzole is less likely to be the cause of anorgasmia and decreased sexual arousal. You should test for diabetes, hypothyroidism, low testosterone, vitamin B12 deficiency, compression of sacral spinal nerve (if you have sciatica like pain) and multiple sclerosis. If no cause is found, then depression and OCD status should be investigated for. If this is ruled out too then maybe your doctor could look into the possibility of riluzole being the cause of anorgasmia and see the effect of slowly tapering this drug and starting another.If you do not have ejaculation then it could be orgasmic anejaculation. In this a person achieves an orgasm which feels like ejaculation but is actually not able to ejaculate. This could be due to failure of emission of semen due to a blockage in the seminiferous or ejaculatory tubes or due to damage to the nerves. Another possibility is retrograde ejaculation where the semen flows back into the bladder due to a weak bladder neck. Treatment is cause dependent so cause has to be found first.\u00a0\u00a0 Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hey guys, I also posted this in the sexual health part but then I saw there was an ALS part so I thought this would be right up your guy's alley since alot of you guys take this drug and the doctor is more familiar with it in this section.Im 23 and I take Riluzole for treatment-resistant OCD (not ALS). Riluzole is the only thing I take. Im having severe trouble with sexual function including anorgasmia and arousal, I was reading that the glutamate process can have an effect on sexual function http://www.psy.fsu.edu/~hull/neuroendocrine.htmand http://www.molecularbrain.com/content/2/1/9is there any possibility that my issue could be caused by Riluzole or do you think it is caused by something else? I obviously have chemicals that are off in the brain, but I have never been entirely anorgasmic and with severe sexual dysfunction. thank you..",
