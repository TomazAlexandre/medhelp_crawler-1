    "question": "After experiencing dizziness and loss of vision generally in one eye; I was told by my doctor that I get optical migraines. I do not have diabeties. The dizziness has stopped me in my tracks and the blurred vision which is generally followed by loss of vision in one eye has caused me much concern because it occurs too often for my liking. I could be sitting, standing, or driving and then all of a sudeden out of no where I start to feel a bit strange, and the above systems creep in. I have tried to breathe deeply to prevent the episode. Why am I experiencing this? Should I get another opinion. I have had CAT Scans, heart nad blood work done. I'm really perplexed.",
