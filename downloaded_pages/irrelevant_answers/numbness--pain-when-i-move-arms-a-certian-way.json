            "answer": "Hi,Is there any tingling sensation associated with it?Numbness can be due to nerve compression, nerve weakness due to lack of essential vitamins or diabetes.I would suggest you to start with a B complex multivitamin and also get your blood sugar test done.At the same time please schedule an appointment with a neurologist and undergo a complete neurological examination.",
