            "answer": "HI, I just have Graves. I am going to do RAI as soon as my doctor gives the go ahead. Right now I am on Methimazole. If I were you I would go on and get the hyper side of you dealt with for sure. Yes, you will always have the antibodies of Graves but they will not be able to harm you when you get your thyroid ablated. I will be glad when I get mine dealt with more permanently. I would like to start exercising more and losing some of my weight. Good luck and let me know how it goes!",

    "question": "Been checking my sugar all day to see how it relates to how I feel, (felt again since synthyroid was increased in January) I'm off from it now 4 days, to prepare for RAI. Diagnosed with Hashitoxosis, Graves and Hashi's same time . Okay the RAI will take care of Graves and leave me hypo (Thyroid is only 1/2 alive now, and won't shut off like it's supposed to with thyroid meds (endo said -autonomous function) So I agree to kill it have it over with, maybe no more swings back and forth, least I can pray. But it seems with hashi's a whole lot of other stuff has been on and off with me, low B12 at times, then it'll test normal (no more injections), gestational diabetes, and I'm having symptoms now , but higher blood sugar levels could be due to stress and beta blockers (stress and thyroid problems who'd imagine you could have both at one time:) LOL) ...Okay so I go and have it nuked is it going to make anything else worse or will it leave it unchanged.\u00a0\u00a0Also if you test positive for graves antibodies that means you definitely have them right? I get in these moods where I doubt what to believe. Also I'm weaning off Xanax so I'm sure that's making it worse...any replies will be appreciated. Also once your thyroid is gone does the Hashi's go away too because it doesn't have anything to attack?God Bless!",
