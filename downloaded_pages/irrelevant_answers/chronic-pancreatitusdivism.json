The stents may require replacement, but has it even been suggested?",

            "answer": "I have a divism with severe chronic pancreatitis and just went through a whipple surgery in Nov. 2010 and still suffering. I had to have the whipple after going through 8 ercps with stents put in and removed with no relief. But you have to take care of the problem because i assure you it won't go away and unfortunately i am still on pain meds and looking at a second surgery now to remove the remaining pancreas with my spleen. I ended up on disabilty which i am sure you will be accepted for like I was because you never know when you will have an attack, not to mention everytime I get an attack I am in the hospital for days NPO to give my pancreas a break and for pain management. Good luck to you but do your homework and find a good pancreatic specialist.",

        {
            "answer": "The stents do require constant changing because the stents can only stay in the pancreas for a short time. Also they can only do so many stent placements and removals until the whipple surgery is your next step. I am sorry to have to post this bad news but I have been dealing with this for a few years now. And again good luck to you",

They removed the islet cells( the cells that create insulin for your body) from the part of\u00a0\u00a0my pancreas that was removed and a transplant team harvested them and they transplanted them into my liver so my liver now makes insulin for me instead of me having to deal with \"brittle\" diabetes.",
