    "question": "I'm 21 years old and yesterday while playing on my computer I absentmindedly touched at my bikini line and felt a bump under my skin. Needless to say, I immediately started to freak out. It's about the size of a pea, maybe a little bit bigger. You can't see anything on top of the skin, no blister, no discoloring any where, not even a red mark. The only way you would know that it was there was to feel it. Yesterday it tended to hurt a bit. Sometimes the pain was constant while other times it would just come and go, but the pain was never severe. I laid a hot washcloth on it later that night and haven't had that pain since, but the bump is still there. It's not an ingrown hair, I'm sure of that. Just wondering if anyone knows what this could be.",
