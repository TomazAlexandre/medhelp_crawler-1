            "answer": "Hi, as long as the bacteria are excreted in the sputum the infection will be contagious. Though the sputum is negative, the infection can sometimes be transmitted. But as she has been initiated on therapy, it\u2019s unlikely that the infection will be contagious. If she has completed the intensive phase of therapy, then she is unlikely to transmit the infection. Ask her to take her medications regularly and to complete the course. And she should take a proper diet as well. If you develop any symptoms of cough, loss of appetite or fever, then consult your doctor for an evaluation. Regards.",

            "answer": "Thank you a lot, doctor, that reassured her a great deal. Could you also comment about the chances of complete cure from tb in her situation, when diabetes is also a factor? Some doctors here have told her that diabetes won't allow to heal her lungs completely and tb will reemerge after the treatment.",

            "answer": "Hi, I understand your anxiety. Diabetes makes a person more prone for infections. Tuberculosis, or TB, is an infectious bacterial disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which most commonly affects the lungs. It is transmitted from person to person via droplets from the throat and lungs of people with the active respiratory disease. But it can be treated completely, just ensure to see that she completes her full course of therapy. And along with this see that her blood sugars are in the normal range. With this the infection will be controlled and recurrence rate is low. Also, give her a good balanced diet to boost up her immune system and to help tackle the infection. So, don't worry and you can post any further queries you have, will be glad to answer. Regards.",

    "question": "Hello, My mother has had diabetes for 10+ years and recently she was diagnosed by tuberculosis. She's been on the standard treatment for 4 weeks now. Her sputum test was negative, however x-rays confirm she has tb, though our doctor said that the disease was detected in time. She doesn't have fever and doesn't cough at all. She feels a little weak and lost some weight.\u00a0\u00a0 The problem is she lives at home with me and my father and she fears to contaminate someone. She tries to isolate herself and I fear that this will affect her psychologically. By \"that\" I mean always worrying about contaminating someone.\u00a0\u00a0I am very hopeful that everything will be ok, the only thing is her being a diabetic (the type where one makes injections twice a day) doesn't help. What is your opinion? What are her chances of infecting someone? Can I give her assurances that there is nothing to worry about? How dangerous is the combo diabetes + tb for her?",
