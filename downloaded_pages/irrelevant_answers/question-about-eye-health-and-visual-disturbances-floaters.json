            "answer": "The first exam I had was from an optometrist. Many here including yourself recommended that I see and Opthalmologist so I did. His results were the same as the Optometrist's. Everything looked completely normal and healthy. I even asked him if he could see the floaters in my eye and he said no.Is it possible to have an issue that would cause these symptoms but not show up during an eye exam? I understand that floaters are inside the eye but could anything else be causing them that wouldnt be detectable through his exam?",

            "answer": "Would the effect from most diseases or illnesses like diabetes, syphilis, lyme disease, tumors etc....be detectable through an eye exam? Most of these from my understanding effect the optic nerve by swelling or something that could be identified through a thorough eye exam.I'm assuming FP means Family Physician but what is a GP?My original family doctor recently closed his practice. Ive been trying to find another permanent doctor for myself and my family. One I recently visited just wanted to give me medications for the headaches without trying to find out the cause of the problem. This really turned me away from her. I'm wanting to know what is causing these sudden headaches, floaters, and dull pressure sensation in my head.I have an appt. with an ENT next week. Im not sure if the pressure is sinus related because I dont have any other cold/allergy symptoms but hopefully this will be a good start.",

    "question": "I recently had a complete eye exam by an Opthalmologist because of floaters and headaches. The exam came back perfect and he said my eyes were in great health. Of course you think of many questions after you leave, otherwise I wouldve asked the doctor.I know floaters can be normal and not related to any major issues at all, but in my case, since the eye exam came back fine what are the possibilities that there could be an underlying problem that the exam wouldnt have picked up? For instance, may diseases like syphilis, tumors, diabetes, etc... can cause visual disturbances. From what Ive read, many of these will cause swelling of the optic nerve or effect it in some way that would be visible during an exam. Is this always the case or could there be an issue no detectable by an eye exam alone making the eye appear to be healthy from the inside out?",
