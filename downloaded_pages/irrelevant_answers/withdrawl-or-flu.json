            "answer": "Hi,I don't think it warrants going to the ER but I would call your doctor and get a good check-up. Since Diabetes is in the mix I would not fool around with it. While you are waiting to see your doctor try taking long, hot baths for the muscle aches and see if that helps at all. Like I said, they won't do much at the ER for withdrawal but if it gets worse and seems as though something else is going on, then get ere right away.Certainly you have all the symptoms of withdrawal and since you have been on the pain medication for such a long time, it is very possible.I hope you get to feeling better soon. Let us know how you make out.",
