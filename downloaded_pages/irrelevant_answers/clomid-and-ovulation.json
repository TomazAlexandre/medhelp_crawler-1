            "answer": "Hey there! :)I have been on clomid for 3 months now and it did make me ovulate later.\u00a0\u00a0Even though it was about 4 days later I kept thinking, \"did I miss it?\u00a0\u00a0Is it to late?\".\u00a0\u00a0So hang in there, it's probably a couple of days late.\u00a0\u00a0Having said that as far as your dizzyness, nausea and things like that.\u00a0\u00a0I had the same thing while taking clomid.\u00a0\u00a0My nausea was the worst though.\u00a0\u00a0I do think I gained about 8 lbs while taking it, definitely going to work on that now that AF has arrived.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't chalk everything up to diabetes just yet, I'd look more into the clomid.\u00a0\u00a0I was on 50 mg first time, then the last 2 times it was upped to 100 mg.\u00a0\u00a0I cramped alot more, the nausea and headaches were worse.I completely understand the frustration. I've been trying for around 8 yrs now and I just figured when I first got married it would naturally happen.\u00a0\u00a0It didn't!\u00a0\u00a0Now all of my younger cousins are having babies. :(\u00a0\u00a0 I just wanna give up though.\u00a0\u00a0I mean at least then I can go through the emotion of possibly never having a child and move on with my life. I won't be disappointed month after month when AF shows up.\u00a0\u00a0BUT then think, IF I quit trying would I miss my chance?\u00a0\u00a0Such a tough spot to be in.\u00a0\u00a0I think \"here I am 32 and I feel like I'm running out of time\".\u00a0\u00a0It's taken this long how much longer is it going to take??Anyways, just hang in there!\u00a0\u00a0Praying the clomid works for you and you have a healthy little bundle of joy in no time! :)\u00a0\u00a0 Take care hun!!",

            "answer": "I know I\u2019m probably jumping to conclusions but, I never felt like this before; the dizziness and nausea while taking clomid. I don't know my mind runs wild when I feed it with wild accusations.Thanks for the kind words. Like I said before my sister-n-law has been trying to for years too. And look she is 12weeks. I find it ridicules that it has to take such a bloody long time for people like us to get pregnant. I really don\u2019t want to have end up doing IVF or even IUI. If I got pregnant once even though it failed I\u2019m sure I can do it again. I just hope it doesn\u2019t take forever.Keep your head up high. It ***** watching younger family members getting pregnant before you. But, think of this use those babies to practice on. If they become screwed up for whatever you did at least it\u2019s not your child. Lol.Good luck!!",

            "answer": "lol Thanks!\u00a0\u00a0 You too hun, you're right it really does suck.\u00a0\u00a0Like yourself I hope it doesn't take much longer, sheesh it's been long enough.\u00a0\u00a0I also had a \"chemical pregnancy\" wayyy back in 2000.\u00a0\u00a0Worse part was I wasn't even trying then and lost it before I even knew I had it. :(\u00a0\u00a0 I would probably do the IUI or IVF if I could afford it right now. My insurance pays NOTHING for infertility.\u00a0\u00a0That ***** even more. :(\u00a0\u00a0Oh well, I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the both of us!\u00a0\u00a0Take care!\u00a0\u00a0Lots of luck!! :D",

    "question": "Technically I am on my 4th round of Clomid. I say technically because I had a mc this past August. I wonder if anyone has ever ovulated late while on Clomid or are you regular? The last three doses I had I ovulated without fail on cd15. I started my AF on Jan. 12 and took 50mg of Clomid on cd3-7. So I should be having signs of ovulation and I am on cd16 (I know I\u2019m prob. questioning to early but I\u2019m curious on the question). My CM is wet but a little tacky; my temp is in 97.24, cervix firm/high. This past week I have been feeling light headed, nausea, my appetite is higher, sort of thirsty hungry too, and I\u2019ve gained some weight. I have worked very hard and I still am working hard to lose the weight. I\u2019m going to make an appointment with my Dr. but, I\u2019m afraid he is going to say I have diabetes.At this point I am so frustrated with everything. I want to be a woman who can just get pregnant and have an easy healthy pregnancy. I\u2019m probably more upset because I just found out my sister-n-law is 12 weeks pregnant.",
