            "answer": "Hello,Well demonstrated causes of recurrent miscarriage are genetic factors (parental chromosomal rearrangements or aging eggs), anatomic (e.g., uterine septum or submucosal fibroids), and immunologic (anti-phospholipids).\u00a0\u00a0Others possible factors include endocrine abnormalities (e.g., abnormal thyroid hormone, diabetes), environmental factors (alcohol or caffeine intake), and thrombophilias (having an increased propensity to form blood clots).The initial work up for recurrent miscarriage involves the following: Chromosomal analyses of you and your partner (called a Karyotype--although if the chromes on the pregnancy tissue was normal this could be bypassed; but I'd recommend it), a Day 3 FSH and estradiol to assess ovarian reserve, assement of the uterine cavity(there are multiple ways this can be accomplished), and blood tests checking for anti-phospholipid antibodies.\u00a0\u00a0Based on your medical and social history your doctor will decide whether other tests are warranted.Best regards,Dr. Downing",

            "answer": "Hi, I'm 38 and had 2 mc's in 4 months.\u00a0\u00a0Both times the baby stopped growing at 6 wks.\u00a0\u00a0They did tissue testing the second time and it was chromosomal.\u00a0\u00a0I chose to have a D&C both times.\u00a0\u00a0I just found out that I'm pregnant again and I'm terrified that I'll mc again.\u00a0\u00a0It seems so unfair that at 38 my body won't work the way it used to.We are truly blessed in that we have 3 wonderful children.\u00a0\u00a0I thank God every day for them but we really do want to have a 4th child.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you all the best for you and your husband with your journey and hope for a successful pregnancy to come.I did't have any severe bleeding with either D&C so I'm not sure about that.\u00a0\u00a0I have heard with some women, the bleeding was an issue and that taking a baby aspirin during the pregnancy actually helped.\u00a0\u00a0There was another womam on this forum who also had 2 mc's...tissue came back normal and her MD instructed her to take the aspirin when she got pregnant a 3rd time.\u00a0\u00a0It helped and she did go on to have a successful pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Also, has your husband had his sperm tested?",

    "question": "Hi Dr.I am a 39 year old women in good health who just suffered my 3rd m/c since Jan.\u00a0\u00a0The first was diagnosed at 10 weeks after spotting since day 1.\u00a0\u00a0I never got a heartbeat and they said it looks like things stopped developing at about 6-7weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I ultimately had a d&c, and the tissue tests came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0The second was a chemical pregnancy, I started to bleed 2 days after a positive early home pregnancy test.\u00a0\u00a0The third was just 2 weeks ago, diagnosed at 8 weeks pregnant with an ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0There had been no spotting, or any other real symptoms, baby just stopped developing around 6 weeks again.\u00a0\u00a0They called it a missed abortion. I also had a d&c that time.\u00a0\u00a0Again,the tissue was normal. My question is, when I have my follow up in 2 more weeks, are there any specific tests I should be requesting?\u00a0\u00a0The only real common factor in both d&c's was severe hemoragging after being given cypotec (spelling?) as I had not dialated in either case.\u00a0\u00a0I have never had any severe bleeding problems in the past, although my mother did in labour with me.\u00a0\u00a0She also experienced several m/c and I am her only living child.\u00a0\u00a0Could there be something genetic? Thank you for your advice.",
