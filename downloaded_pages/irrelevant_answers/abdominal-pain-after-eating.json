            "answer": "This is your health so yes keep pursuing it until you get an answer! It sounds like some of your symptoms could lead to diabetes but you should check with your Dr. When I have weak spells I eat a slice of cheese and it helps me but as I say talk to your Dr and let them know you will not stop until you get a diagnosis and if they are not willing to help you then find a Dr who will. I assure you there are Dr's who will keep looking until they find the answer and will treat you until they do. Good luck:)",

            "answer": "I am sorry you are having these medical issues. In my opinion your symptoms are classic for GERD. Chocolate is one of the worst things you can eat if you have GERD. \"Sugary things\" tend to make a lot of people sleepy contrary to the belief that they \"hype\" you up.If you have ever had blood work done (and I assume you have) a glucose level (checking your sugar level) is included in most every routine draw that is done. If you haven't had a recent blood test than yes it should be done.Only a blood test can determine if you have diabetes. I would hope your doc has included such testing in routine physicals. In order to determine whether or not a patient has pre-diabetes or diabetes, health care providers conduct a Fasting Plasma Glucose Test (FPG) or an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). Either test can be used to diagnose pre-diabetes or diabetes. The American Diabetes Association recommends the FPG because it is easier, faster, and less expensive to perform.Some diabetes symptoms include:Frequent urinationExcessive thirstExtreme hungerUnusual weight lossIncreased fatigueIrritabilityBlurry visionBe sure to bring up your concerns on your next visit to your physician. In the meantime avoid the food that cause your symptoms. And if\u00a0\u00a0they continue you should see your physician soon. I wish you the best in your search for answers. Please keep us posted and take care. Tuck.",

            "answer": "Hi Kristi,If you continue having these pains and they are located in your upper stomach, get your\u00a0\u00a0gallbladder checked. (a hide-a-scan will confirm it) Have you been checked for celiac disease? My daughter was misdiagnosed and had her gallbladder out at 16 (and the doc said it was because she wasn't eating enough yogurt!) I know a lot of doc's dismiss kid's and teens with abdominal probs but don't let it go if it persists. They caught my daughter's gallbladder trouble went it was only functioning at 10%. But it also could be diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Have someone check your Blood Glucose levels asap somewhere, and see if it's that.\u00a0\u00a0If you ever need any diabetes support just let me know we have been pro's at it since my daughter was about 4 and she's turning 18 soon.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck honey!\u00a0\u00a0Joan",

    "question": "lately I've been having some problems with pains in my stomach usually after eating. I guess I started noticing it when I had a smoothie and shortly after I started to feel very dizzy and had short pains in my neck and left arm. A couple days later I was in class just after eating lunch and I started to have really bad stomache cramps and shortly after the cramps I couldnt breathe and then felt very dizzy. Ever since I havent been getting dizzy after eating but I have had really sharp pains in my abs or chest. I also noticed that it only happens after I eat things that are sugery. I have had a lot of bad reactions to eating chocolate. And of course it didnt happen as much once I went to the doctor. I've been to the doctor twice and she still doesn't know whats wrong. I know its not lactose intolerance, and I'm not really sure if it's something like diabetes, but I have been very thirsty and very tired recently, so it could be diabetes. Do you have any clue what it might be?",
