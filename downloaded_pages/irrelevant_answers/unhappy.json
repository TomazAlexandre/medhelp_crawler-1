This time I started at 110lbs and I'm already at 160lbs with a month to go. I know it ***** to have gained a bunch of weight :(. We have to be positive and be glad that we are able to carry children.

I was on my way down back to normal weight I was 140 but this I got pregnant again. i am on 31week and I am at 170.Some people may think its not that big but I am am barely 5\"2 and used to being 110 or 115.. so i am really not use to having extra weight.Just want to share that what you are feeling is normal as long as you know we got this and when baby is out make it our goal to go back to our healthy normal weight :)",

            "answer": "I am 6 weeks pregnant with my third child. I have type 1 diabetes. I have had it for 21 years now. It is muchore difficult to manage while pregnant. Taking it one day at a time and talking with others will definitely help ease your worries. Each woman has different body changes during their pregnancy. Do not let others judge you. It is up to your physician to determine if you are to large or not. Diabetes can increase the size of the baby, but it can also make their birth weight lower. It is important to take care of you and your baby's needs, so don't worry about all those other people and their comments, especially if they aren't your physician. Good luck.",

It feels like its already stretched too much i can barely move, going to the gym has helped BUT it is still different I am not going to lie and say I LOVE the feeling of being pregnant. But I understand we are all different and some women are just better handling all the changes.I have OB appt today and asking my ob for anti dep prescription as i am falling again into depression, last pregnancy it got bad I was suicidal. This time I will kick post partum depression' @$$ before it start kicking mine lol!!And... i am actually looking forward to just get really angry about losing all these fatness after baby is out. I can understand the pregnancy belly but not the bloated face hands and legs lol.Cheers and good luck girl",

I've gotten \"you don't look pregnant are you sure the baby's okay?\" Then I finally popped and I got \"dang you got huge quick\". Society just ***** and people feel like they have to add on their 2 sense on what they believe a woman should look like while pregnant. If your doctor says your doing fine. You are doing fine. People carry their babies all different ways and their body reacts to pregnancy way different then the next person. Alot of people don't understand that. As far as diabetes goes. I was diabetic before pregnancy so since I was 6 weeks pregnant I had to watch what I eat, write down everything, give myself insulin, walk even more closely. It's a pain in the ***. BUT, it will be very worth it when the baby is here. Knowing you took every precaution for a healthy baby. So eff what everyone else thinks. I know you are putting in all your effort. Congrats! And I hope baby comes soon :)",

    "question": "Hi girls,I'm 33w +3days & I have Gestational Diabetes.I'm keeping a record of my food intake and bloodsugar levels and all my insulin dosages.Carefully planning all my meals.It feels like every day is about this and that normal life is so complicated now.Due to my Diabetes I am growing larger than usual pregnancies (even with all my efforts) and the colleagues at work are not holding back their comments.It both hurts and annoys me.I used to be a skinny girl and now I am not.One colleague said I had exploaded..yes, actually used that word.Exploaded.another keeps going on and on about how big I am and how his friend who is closer to her due date is so much smaller.I find myself avoiding people at work.I avoid eyecontact.I try to get away and hide under bulky clothes.But EVERY DAY -without fail- people comment on my size and pregnancy.It truly bothers me.I have grown so self-aware and unhappy with my situation/appearance that I find it hard to enjoy the pregnancy and even at times having a baby.I constantly worry about my size/weight and I feel anxiety to have so many weeks left of my pregnancy.I just want to get back in shape.I don't go on maternity leave until 2weeks from now..No real question.Only complaining.:(",
