            "answer": "Hello,This feeling of crawling over the body is called parasthesia. Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder.I hope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted in case you have any additional doubts. Kind regards.",

            "answer": "Hi-I have had the same feeling for the past three weeks. Especially my face and scalp. I thought it might have been scabies but the doctor stated it was a reaction to a bug bite and that scabies don't infest the scalp and face, gave me anti-itch cream and wrote me off. After two weeks, I still itch but now it's accompanied by pins and needles sensation which increases the itching. I also get tiny pimple like bumps immediately followin the itch. I am up all nite because it's when it attacks the most. I have used permethrin, sulfur soap, sulfur ointment, alcohol, apple cider vinegar, and funny enough...cipro, which actually relieved the itching on the scalp. What is this? I have a daughter who was not feeling anything until two days ago. So I can't be crazy if she's complaining about itchy skin and scalp also. Could it be somekind of bacteria? I bought a 60x to 100x small microscope to check for crawlers but see\u00a0\u00a0nothing.",
