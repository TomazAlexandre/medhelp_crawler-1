            "answer": "Yes I know what this is: It's most likely magnesium depletion. It's like a burning in your legs, hands, forearms - I have had this on and off for the 17 years I've had type 1 diabetes. When I was hospitalized for insulin purging (I have diabulimia) , it turns out that high blood sugars for a long time (sometimes for a week or more) leads us to urinate most of the magnesium (and sometimes potassium) away, and that causes the cramping. I particularly get this just before my period starts!Getting my blood sugars under better control and drinking the new exercise-friendly diet iced teas by nestle sure helps with it. Eating a half a banana a couple of times a day as my fruit choice also helps.Hope this helps you too!Hope you feel better soon!",

            "answer": "I KNOW beyond any shadow of a doubt what causes my muscle crampscommonly called charlie horses.\u00a0\u00a0It is SUGAR.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot eat even a smallamount without horrendous pain.\u00a0\u00a0The cramps occur in my hands, feet,calves, thighs, and even my sides and sometimes all at the same time.It turns me into a human pretzel.\u00a0\u00a0Needless to say that is incentive enoughto not touch sugar, however even a food with as small as ten grams cancause cramps although not to the extent that say a candy bar wouldcause.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot eat dried fruit although I can eat most fresh fruit insmall servings.\u00a0\u00a0Now I would just like to know WHY this occurs.What does sugar do to my body to cause the cramps.\u00a0\u00a0Is it notenough insulin, too much insulin, or not insulin at all.\u00a0\u00a0Or somethingaltogether different.\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate a response from anyone whomight know the answer.\u00a0\u00a0I do take calcium and eat lots of vegetablesand some fruit each day.",

Before menopause this would happen occasionally but after menopause it happened quite often until I made the connection.\u00a0\u00a0I think it must have to do with the beginnings of type 2 diabetes as I have read that many diabetics get leg cramps.\u00a0\u00a0The great news is that I have found a wonderful candy bar, albeit expensive, that I can have.\u00a0\u00a0It's called Lily's, with stevia.\u00a0\u00a0The other cool thing is that I once thought the caffeine in chocolate was what made me have cramps but now I know it was the sugar!\u00a0\u00a0The inulin in them does all kinds of wonderful things, too, like helps me sleep since inulin promotes calcium and magnesium absorption.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you!",

            "answer": "I don't know the answer. I am in my seventies am not a diabetic but I do have an insulin intolerance, often described as pre-diabetic. The net effect is if I eat sugar containing products my blood sugar rises just as if I had diabetics.I have been a runner for most of my life after running would sometime get killer cramps as you describe. I now have made the connection to when I have sugar containing products such as Gaterade or a dessert. I have noticed After consuming sugar I drink a LOT of water. This must lower my blood electrolytes causing cramps. I expect the thirst is not only from the sweat loss and exercise, but an attempt by my body to expell the sugar.In any case less sugar fewer killer cramps. When consuming a lot of water I drink I put in a little electrolyte powder or table salt. In my case the salt does not elevate my blood pressure, I expect because of the exercise.So for what it is worth, it took me a long time to figure it out, but I expect that is the reason and solution.",

            "answer": "Many diabetics complain leg cramps that jerk them wide-awake at night. They are rather confused and don\u2019t know how to improve this condition. Now the following will reveal causes of cramps in diabetics so as to help you understand it and take nichetargeting measures.Actually, for diabetics, leg cramps may be caused by a variety of reasons. One cause, which may be seen in diabetics who take insulin, is low potassium. Potassium deficiency can also be aggravated due to loss of heavy potassium in diabetics with frequent and excess urine. A simple blood test can rule out if this is the cause.",

            "answer": "Hi,the only way to know if you have diabetes is to be tested for it.Does your dad have a blood sugar meter at home?\u00a0\u00a0If so, maybe you can borrow it.Fasting blood sugar should be < 95 (ideally in the 80s).\u00a0\u00a0If greater than 125 it will already get you diagnosed as diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Post eating should be less than 140 (ideally 120).\u00a0\u00a0If you test and your numbers are higher, it would be a good idea to see a dr for proper evaluation.If your dad doesn't have a meter you may either buy one of your own, else go see your dr and ask for checkup.\u00a0\u00a0They will likely test Hba1c (average 3 month blood sugar) and fasting blood sugar.Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Come back and let us know.",
