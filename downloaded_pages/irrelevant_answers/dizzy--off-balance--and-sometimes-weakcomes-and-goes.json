    "question": "I am 20 years old and had a sinus infection about 2 months ago. Ever since then the doctors diagnosed me with vertigo and told me it would go away after taking amoxicillin. The \"vertigo\" symptoms have only gotten worse over the past 2 months and now sometimes I get weak and can't even see straight. I went to the gym last week and worked out for about 5 minutes before everything was turning black and I felt dizzy. I finally went to the e.r. after that incident and they took a cat scan of my sinuses and head. They said everything looks fine with my sinuses but they are still concerned. I am going back to the e.r to get an mri and I am very scared it is something neurological or diabetes or.....???? Is there anyway that this could be an inner ear infection they did not detect? I get really off balance sometimes and then I am fine. The doctor made me close my eyes and put my arms out and I fell backwards.",
