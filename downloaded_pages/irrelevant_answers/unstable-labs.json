            "answer": "Has he adjusted your meds. Maybe you don't need as much as you are taking or you need to increase it. I know that from what I have heard it that its possible to have to make adjustments. By the weight gain you could be prediabetic now that is possible. That would explain the dry mouth and the itch because of the sugar you are secreting from the urine. Hot flashes could be hormonal and when your insulin swings up and down it can cause them.I too had gastric bypass in 2005 and lost 140 pounds. Now its the hard part of maintaing my weight. Are you seeing an endocrinologist?Good luckPaula",

    "question": "Hello:I am SEVERLY HYPOTHYROID and cannot get stabilized in the last 8 yrs. I was pre-diabetic before I had gastric bypass surgery in 2004. In the past 1 1/2 yrs I have been seemingly getting worse. I have severe hot flashes, abnormal weight gain (30 lbs in the last 2 months), dry mouth, SEVERE vaginal itch, stabbing pain in the bottom of my feet and heart palps (just went to the doc and he said my heart was skipping beats). The doc cannot figure out why my TSH is high (which indicates HYPOthyroid, which I have been for the last 15 yrs) and my T3 and T4 are low (indicative of Hyperthyroid). Could it be diabetes? The doc never even suggested it, but, I am beginning to wonder. Does this sound familiar to anyone? Is this something I should bring up to the doc to maybe check? I really would appreciate any input as I am at my wit's end here.",
