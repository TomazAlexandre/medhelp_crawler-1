            "answer": "Hello,Such vibratory sensations in the penis can be due to traumatic damage to the nerves in penis or their entrapment or compression,diabetes(already ruled out in your case),STD\u2019s like gonorrhea and Chlamydia,prostatitis or bacterial urethritis.I would suggest you to consult a urologist and get evaluated for nerve compression and urethritis.In urethritis, the diagnosis can be made only by the proper collections of urine specimens from both the urethra and the bladder. These specimens will reveal the presence of white blood cells in the urethral washings, while the midstream (bladder) specimen will be free of cells.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted if you have any additional queries.",
