            "answer": "Hello,From the symptoms it can be neurodermatitis or parasthesia. Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms improve.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have read everything I can about this condition with extremely itchy legs with no solution.\u00a0\u00a0It is not stress, or any form of allergy.\u00a0\u00a0The way that the itch jumps around on my legs almost makes me feel like its a nerve problem.\u00a0\u00a0As soon as I scratch for some relief right by my knees, the itch is instantly on my other leg just as intense, on some other random spot.\u00a0\u00a0This cycle never stops, but you keep chasing this itch.\u00a0\u00a0If I do not scratch it, my leg will jerk, making me look even more sane.\u00a0\u00a0Changing every external factor (lotions, detergents, perfumes, soaps, dyes) has not changed one thing.\u00a0\u00a0There are no specific triggers, it just starts when it wants to. It will keep me up at night or wake me up.\u00a0\u00a0There is no relief until is decides to go away.\u00a0\u00a0I want to rip my skin off or scratch it with a rake!\u00a0\u00a0This condition is extremely frustrating.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing that makes it a little better is when my legs are freshly shaved, but it does not make it go away by any means.\u00a0\u00a0Since no doctors can tell us what is wrong I feel we need to get together and compare all of our own notes and see if we can find some commonality.\u00a0\u00a0We need to figure this out and hopefully come up with a solution.\u00a0\u00a0My newest experiment, staying with the nerve theory, is to take B12 which maintains nervous system health.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully this works!This discussion is related to/posts/show/241193.",
