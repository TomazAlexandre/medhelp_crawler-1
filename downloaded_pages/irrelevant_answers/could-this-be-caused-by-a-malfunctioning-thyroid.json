            "answer": "The TSH over 3 would point to Hypothyroidism (Low thyroid or more simply \"Hypo\")This would warrant at best further testing of thyroid. Specifically demand to be tested for Free T4 and Free T3 tests. Be very specific with the word \"FREE\".\u00a0\u00a0It is NOT about the cost of the test. Rather it is noting a specific test that counts the hormone that is NOT attached to a protein. And thus \"free\" meaning all by itself.\u00a0\u00a0This is important because ONLY the \"free\" unattached hormones are used by your body.If you do not specify \"free\" then you may get \"total\" test which is obsolete and of limited value.What are your symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0how do you feel?",

            "answer": "Agree with Barb here.The a1c of 5.9 gives you an average blood sugar level of about 130.This alone warrants further investigation by your Dr.A normal A1c is < 5, with average blood sugar of 100, or a bit lower.If addressing blood sugar with diet, look at lower carb, and add in exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Get a blood sugar meter and test how high you go about 1 1/2 - 2 hours after eating (maximum should be < 140).\u00a0\u00a0Lose weight if overweight.Further, if your thyroid is out, it also can exacerbate blood sugar problems.",
