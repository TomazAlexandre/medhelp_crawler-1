    "question": "Can i as if anyone knows if there is any possibility of damage to my thyroid from MS. I ask because i have long standing MS symptoms including muscle aches in arms, hands and legs along with severe and permanent loss of sensation in my thighs. My question is really concerning the likelihood a thyroid disorder. I am finding it very, very slowto shift my excess weight. I follow a strict diet and exercise program and over a six month period the weight is moving but very slowly. So i was wondering if my possible MS may have affected my thyroid or metabolic rate? I used to loose weight without too much effort, now its almost impossible. I guess it could always be down to being middle aged though.I am currently waiting for my first MRI appointment, so i am not DX as yet.\u00a0\u00a0I have tested neg for diabetes.Any advice welcome.",
