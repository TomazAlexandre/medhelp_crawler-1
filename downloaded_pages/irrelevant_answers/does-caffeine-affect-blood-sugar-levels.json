            "answer": "\"I feel like my sugar stays more balanced if I don't have coffee\"Testing glucose b4 and after provides an insight how caffeine affects your levels. The amount consumed is what matters too. Having spoken to several Endo's on this subject all have stated less than 2 cups - coffee or tea - daily is acceptable. Also, caffeine can bring about nausea on an empty stomach. Why not switch to decaffeinated?",
