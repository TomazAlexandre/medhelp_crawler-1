    "question": "Hello, I am writing on behalf of my mother. She is 50 years old and It has been close to fifteen years that she has had some kind of nerve damage in her right leg. She is constantly limping and complaining of numbness to her right foot. Sometimes she says it feels like she is walking on lumps. Surprisingly enough, she never complains of pain. It's mostly just uncomfortable for her. Now, she has been to several different doctors all who cannot figure out what is wrong with her. They have determined that there is some sort of nerve damage but don't know where it is or what is causing it. She has has tones of MRIs and CT scans on her whole body and the only thing that has shown up are small white spots on her brain which doctors have said are \"age spots\".\u00a0\u00a0They have ruled out diseases such as MS, Parkinson's, and Huntington's. Her day to day living has not really been affected by this other then the constant limping. She is just frustrated and wants to know exactly what is wrong and if there is some kind of cure out there. If there is anyone out there that experience similar symptoms or know someone who does please let me know and maybe ou can shed some insight on what doctors seem to be missing! Thank you for reading!!!",
