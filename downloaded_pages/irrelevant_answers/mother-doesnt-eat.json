            "answer": "you might check and see if any of her meds have decreased appetite listed as a side effect. Also, how is her dental health? It might just be too hard for her to chew it, A lot of people her age would not want to share that information. They keep physical problems private. Good luck. Have you tried all of the nutritian (spelled wrong) drinks and protein drinks? They have improved a lot in flavor in recent years. Good luck, your mother is so lucky to have a caring daughter.",

I'm always honored to be in her company. I'm told that she will be going in for a cat scan this week for her stomach to see why she is not having any appetite at all. Protein drinks are a great idea. I will try to see if she will have them.countryrose!",
