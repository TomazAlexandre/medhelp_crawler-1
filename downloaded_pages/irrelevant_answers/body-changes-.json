Try to eat less sweets now I'm not saying remove them from your diet completely but don't go overboard because if you do end up having gestational diabetes like me you have a chance to have a large baby. It also ages the placenta my doctor is having me induced at 37 weeks 4 days. I'm currently 31 weeks 5 days.",
