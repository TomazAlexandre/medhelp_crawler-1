            "answer": "If you have a vaginal birth you should go home within 2 days. If you have a cesarean you\u00a0\u00a0may be there for a few more days. I'm not really sure how the UK does things after a cesarean.I'm giving birth at a birth center and I go home in 6 hours which is a huge blessing to me. So long as you have support at home you'll be fine! It's either lay in bed at the hospital with hospital food or go home and be in your own environment with your own smells, your own foods, your shower, etc. and bond with baby while hubby or whoever is there to help and support you.I hope that perspective encourages you if you do go home within several hours of birth!",

            "answer": "Oh I am happy to go home after 6 hours, I hate hospitals, I just was not sure on how long after having bubba I cam go home cause I'm being induced at 38 weeks with gd and on medication, I was told baby needs his sugar tested 2hours after birth, I just didn't know that if everything was ok with his sugars if I could then go home after 6 hours. This is my fourth baby and the others all come at 40 weeks on there own, so it is strange having a date to have a baby so strange xx",
