            "answer": "Hi Shelby,How are you feeling?I think you are right in thinking that it is taking longer time for healing. Healing or inflammation takes longer if there are other conditions associated like Diabetes, Vitamin deficiency, Chronic diseases etc.Any infective pathology in body would delay healing.Do you have one?Yes prolong epidural inflammation would lead to fibrosis. I think it is the thoracic Prolapse with post-surgical healing causing you back pain.I think you need to consult a physiotherapist and start physical therapy.Up on finishing one course of physiotherapy, your physiotherapist can evaluate you and guide you regarding which jobs would be comfortable for you.Alternatively, you can consult an occupational therapist for any other queries.Bye.",

            "answer": "Hi,I can understand your feelings towards your family, but I like the attitude that you should take care of your self first and then about your work.I feel if your health is fine you can earn money as much as you want, but if you have lot of money and dont have healthy body, then that money is of no use.I think you should be following your physiotherapist regularly and evaluate yourself at the end of one session.Keep me informed if you have any queries.Bye.",

    "question": "I had a lumber decompression on 18/09/07 at L5-S1.\u00a0\u00a0It has relieved the sciatica's intensity however I still suffer intermittent sciatica and other sensory changes throughout each day.\u00a0\u00a0Since the operation a have developed a lot more LBP which radiates up my back to below my bra strap.\u00a0\u00a0I am very tender inbetween my lower ribs at the back and sides.\u00a0\u00a0I now get episodes of very sharp pain through my pelvis, and occasionally get urge incontinence which I haven't had before.\u00a0\u00a0I had a MRI 4/1/08 due to this incontinence, it found diffuse epidural inflammation at the L5-S1 level surrounding the exiting nerve root, disc degeneration but no recurrent prolapse. And a prolapse at T10-11 that mildly indents the spinal cord but doesn't show any signal change.\u00a0\u00a0My questions are: why does this epidural inflammation take so long to settle, or is it going to become epidural fibrosis? Is the thoracic prolapse causing my back pain and other symptoms or is it instability caused by the laminectomy at L5-S1?\u00a0\u00a0I don't want any further surgery, but I am a midwife and wonder if it is wise to ever return to physically demanding work or hobbies with a thoracic prolapse that is already touching the spinal cord?Thanks Shelby72",
