            "answer": "Hello bisous,We're volunteers here and not medical professionals.\u00a0\u00a0The comment below has some good tips.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sorry that I'm unaware of special needs for diabetic children the time of toilet training.I do know that all diabetics can feel increased need to urinate if our blood sugars are high, but I think that diabetic munchkins have the ability to control the timing that others do.\u00a0\u00a0Frequent urination is a symptom of undiagnosed or uncontrolled diabetes, as you know.\u00a0\u00a0Once we get under reasonably control, our frequency is similar to folks without diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, diabetics can never achieve perfect blood sugars all the time, so there will be ups & downs.Good luck with toilet training.\u00a0\u00a0You might find these websites helpful:http://www.aap.org/pubed/ZZZR6LONH4C.htmhttp://extension.missouri.edu/xplor/hesguide/humanrel/gh6128.htmGood luck!",

            "answer": "My son started out potty training at 18months.\u00a0\u00a0I know this is soon but i wanted to get him familiar as to what the potty/toilet was used for.\u00a0\u00a0He took well to it and sometimes just played with it which was fine.\u00a0\u00a0He was potty trained at 2years 2months.\u00a0\u00a0We did not use pull ups during the day.\u00a0\u00a0He wore underwear training pants at daycare and at home until bed time. On weekends he used underwear unless we were going out to the store.\u00a0\u00a0We continue to use pull ups at bed time right now but he is taken to potty when he wakes up at night.\u00a0\u00a0It is a job training with use of underwear but they learn much quicker and do not like the feeling of being wet or nasty.With him being trained at 2 years we were able to pick up on him with constant urination this led to his diagnosis.Good Luck!!",
