            "answer": "Drinking soy drinks before glucose test defeats the purpose of the test since soy drinks contain lots of sugars.Ants in the toilet indicates excessive sugar in your urine. If you have excess sugar in your body, the body tries to eliminate it by way of your urine. This is a marker for diabetes. Go get an A1c test to confirm what your glucose levels are. Lab results are your for the asking by law so always get a copy for your own records.There is no cure for diabetes but Lifestyle change is the key for all diabetics. Blood sugar levels can be stabilized by improving nutrition, adding exercise and achieving a healthy weight.",

    "question": "Hi everyone,Would need some clarification from expert here... I am 25 this year.... and recently i went for a body checkup for my new job and the checkup includes of urine test.....I remember that day when i went for the test i drank a cup of soya bean before going to the clinic. After passing my urine to the nurse.... the nurse ask me \" You have diabetes?\" erm... but that was not that i know of. The nurse told me that my urine have high sugar level which i saw she wrote (+++) on a piece of paper for the doctor.The doctor told me to fast for at least 8 hour before going for the 2nd test, which is the day after tomorrow. I also bought a Glucose strip (Diastix) to test out my urine frequently. Indeed everytime after food, my glucose appear quite high as the testing strip colour was dark but after a few hour it went back to negative or very light colour ?Also i started to realise that my toilet got very tiny ants.... Does this 2 symptom already prove that i got diabetes? I have been drinking alot of water lately .. at least 3 litre a day... will that help ?What if i really diagnosed diabetes... is there a chance to recover ? Can I live a life like normal people... if i adjust my diet like lesser can drink...I am a non smoker and i don't drink either... Can someone please advice me?",
