            "answer": "Hi!You need to understand that these sensations of pins/needles, cold, water dripping etc are indications of an underlying disease like diabetes, thyroid malfunction, Lyme\u2019s lupus or due to pinched nerves or deficiencies like vitamin B12 or vitamin D.The more you learn to ignore them, the more progressive the underlying cause will become as there will be no treatment.Please do not take it as something you need to overcome yourself and consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "Thank You very much for care shown. I deeply appreciate youre care :)After checking youre list for medical condition, I know I have two of the issues from it: namely; pinched nerves and Vit D deficency. I had been very hard on myself on my spiritual awakening and in midst of it; I have intentionally compressed and developed a inner wound in pineal of my head. I think it may have affected and compressed my nerves there.As for Vit D deficency, I have followed course suggested by my physician of taking injections and tabs.I am still having this sensations but they are few and far in between.Thank you, again Dr Kokil Mathur for youre kind and accurate advice.:)",

    "question": "Well if its self created than i cant escape.. it will make sense someday or the otherfor me, thats today :) I have myself tied myself in knots due to anxiety and stress and absolutely not but moreso as I feared that I was fearing .. if that makes any sense to anyone..I had feelings of water drop dripping over me, occasional pins and needle sensations, not giving attention towards hardening myself more to my own distress ..not dismay. I would not allow myself to attain to my own feelings and pain just so to prove that I can sustain more of it. I also had hot and cold sensations but mostly cold drops or similar sensations. I have thought bizzare things for this but now I can see what I am doing to myself by not allowing space for anxiety but taking it as a responsiblity to do still something about it all by myself without giving myself any rest. Hope this helps someone.",
