    "question": "ive had two miscarriages one in october at 8weeks and one in january 10weeks.. my hospital decided to do an investigation as to why, they took alot of blood to test for thyroid problems, diabetes, blood clotting disorders ect and found nothing, they did an internal scan and on the sheet they gave me to give to my doctor it said'anteverted uterus, appears normal shape, size and echotexture,triple endometrial line present.left ovary appears normal shape and size.right ovary is normal shape but is enlarged. both ovaries have multiple follicleswithin,>12 appearance suggestive of polycystic ovaries.'my doctor said i have polycystic ovarian syndrome, this was in april, she suggested to put me on a diabetes medication wich is meant to help with this condition but another doctor said to get a blood test to see my progesterone levels on day 3 and 21 of my cycle, i was just wondering if theres anybody else with the same problem and if after being put on medication did it help you to have a full term healthy pregnancy? and what medication were you given? feel pretty hopeless :(",
