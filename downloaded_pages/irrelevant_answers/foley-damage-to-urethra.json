            "answer": "Hi,I have had surgery on the bladderneck and prostate at the age of 30. I have had to use indwelling Foley catheters on many occasions. Due to the surgery, I have ended up with retrograde ejeculation where the semen enters the bladder instead of out through the penis. Surgery on the prostate can dammage the sphyncter that normaly closes during ejeculation. Normally this sphyncter closes to prevent the semen from going into the bladder, it is also closed to prevent the mix up of urine and semen.It is possibly that damage to sphyncter has occured. In my case many years after the surgery, I have now noticed that a very watery semen is expelled from the penis. The amount is very small, most of it still enters the bladder. The only way that semen from the bladder is expelled is during urination shortly after ejeculation.Did you have hany transurethral surgery or open prostate or bladder surgey? That could be the cause.All the best,Ron",

            "answer": "Hello,Since you had recent surgery, so non ejaculation can be due to dry orgasm or retrograde ejaculation. It may be due retrograde ejaculation when the semen goes into the bladder instead of out through the penis. Common cause of such symptoms are ejaculatory duct obstruction, diabetes, medications for treating high blood pressure, prostate enlargement and mood disorders, retrograde ejaculation, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or seminal vesicle obstruction. Sometimes procedures like prostatectomy, transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP), transurethral microwave therapy (TUMT), transurethral needle ablation (TUNA), laser therapy of prostate\u00a0\u00a0and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) may also cause such symptoms. I suggest you to consult a urologist and get some investigations done. These include blood sugar levels, blood tests, ultrasound of the prostate, ejaculatory ducts and seminal vesicles and BP monitoring.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
