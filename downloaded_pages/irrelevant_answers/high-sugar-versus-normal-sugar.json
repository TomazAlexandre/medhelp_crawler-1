            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.I would recommend you speak with your doctor, and if possible a nutritionist. It is very important for both you and your baby that you keep your blood sugar under control and maintain a healthy diet If your doctor feels that you can do that by making dietary changes, the support of a nutritionist might be helpful. However, your doctor may feel that insulin is the best and safest way to keep your blood sugar under control. It is important to remember that gestational diabetes is a condition that will last for the duration of your pregnancy. It is unlikely that you would continue to have diabetes after you have your baby.Good luck and congratulations on your pregnancy.Cathy",
