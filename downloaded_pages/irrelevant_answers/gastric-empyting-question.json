            "answer": "Dear Laura,I assume that the gastric emptying test was ordered because of symptoms that your son displayed e.g. poor appetite, 'filled up quickly', vomiting.\u00a0\u00a0The study does indeed demonstrate substantail dysmotility.\u00a0\u00a0I would think that looking for an underlying cause would be appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0IF a treatable cause is found, then you would not have to consider symptomatic therapy with prokinetic agents.Gastroparesis refers to a condition in which impaired muscle contractility is the cause for the retained food in th estomach.\u00a0\u00a0Alterations in motor function or neural innervation of the gastric muscle e.g. in diabetes, can cause gastroparesis\u00a0\u00a0It is necessary to exclude mechanical obstruction e.g. strictures, congenital abnormalities, pancreatitis because these conditions have specific treatments which can prevent gastric stasis",

            "answer": "Hi Laura:I am not a doctor but someone who knows quite a bit about gadtroparesis. Many things can cause the stomach to not empty properly. Yes an obstruction of some kind can cause delay in gastric emptying, diabetes, viruses, prior surgery around the area of the stomach that might have damaged the vagus nerve. etc....If the standard prokinteic medications do not work for your son, then I would make sure I found a doctor who could do some further testing to maybe get more answers and maybe rule what is not causing the problem. Gastroparesis is a funny problem because often there is no found cause and remains a mystery. That is why many people have what they call idiopathic \" of unknown origin\" gastroparesis.You are welcome to e-mail me at ***@****.Carol",

            "answer": "My girlfriend is 43 years old, has one kidney, had gestational diabetes, and had a disc removed from her neck (b/c of a car wreck).\u00a0\u00a0She had a baby by c-section the 25th of January 2000.\u00a0\u00a0The baby was and is fine, but his mothers stomach started distending 2 days after birth. Her first doctor (obgyn) said it was normal to have some swelling, that was fine. Then, two days later, she looked like she was 9 months pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0We told him something must not be right, but he looked and felt her stomach and said it should go away in a few days. (24 hours after the baby was born, the nurses gave her solid food against the doctors orders). Dr. sent her home even when she was in severe pain and looked like she was 9 months pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0That night, she was in so much pain that the next morning she went into the ER. They did blood tests and thought it was pancreatitis.\u00a0\u00a0Well, 2 days later, the Dr. hadn't gotten a specialist and said she had an ileus. I looked it up in a medical book and I figured that she had peritonitis.\u00a0\u00a0The dr. said NO. We figured he was giving us the run-around. We requested that he find out what the problem was or get a specialist. Well, 3 days later, after tryiung to call and get in touch with him, he gets one and he orders emergency surgery immediately. My girlfriend had 2 perforations on her large intestines and had two colostomies done on her that night. The sepcialist said she had peritonitis, septis, and a little pneumonia in her liungs. Her insides were full of fecal matter, they suck it all out. Five days later, they did another surgery to take pus from around her liver, pancreas and all around. They put her on a respirator and don't know when to take it off.\u00a0\u00a0Another 4 days and they are wanting to do another small opening to explore her abdomen. They should have found out the first 2 surgeries. The specialist told me that she didn't have Crohn's disease, diverticulitis, or peptic ulcers, no hepatitis, no pancreatitis, no meckel diverticulum, non inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, intestinal polyps, fecal impaction, or fecal incontinence.\u00a0\u00a0He said there might be intestinal obstruction, ischemia of bowel or proctiles but he does not think so.What causes an intestine to perforate?\u00a0\u00a0Is it from being distended too long?\u00a0\u00a0How long does it take to get septic when the abdomen is filled with stool and gas?\u00a0\u00a0\"Are the doctors missing something here?\u00a0\u00a0have you ever heard of such a thing like this happening?I think the first doctor had a bit of negligence and malpractice on his part.\u00a0\u00a0Could an epidural have caused the bowels or paralize and not come back, or cause peritonitis?Please answer me or send me to where I can get answers right away. PLEASE HURRY BEFORE THEY DO ANOTHER SURGERY!!My email address is : ***@****Thanking you in advance,I am Greg LeBlanc",

            "answer": "These articles on gastroparesis are very interesting. My son had a gastric transit time done at Mayo Clinic last month, and after 7 hours, less than 26% of the food had made it to the small bowel. They also found that he has a malabsorption syndrome going on, as way too much fat, protein, calories, calcium, vitamins, minerals, etc., are going straight through him and into the stool. We know by testing he has had performed (we spent a total of 4 weeks there) that he suffers from autonomic dysfunction, which causes the gastroparesis, etc. He has lost 43 lbs. since September of 1999. However, none of the physicians have suggested anything other than things like Ensure, and \"eat more.\" No mention of meds such as I have seen in your posts. He had EGD with biopsies of the esophagus, stomach and small bowel (5 total) as they thought sure they would find celiac disease or pancreatic insufficiency, etc., but nothing more than a fair amount of \"inflammation.\"\u00a0\u00a0I am interested in anything anyone has to add.By the way, they have told us that either he is suffering from a \"silent\" pheochromocytoma (which would explain 100% of his symptoms, abnormal test results, etc.) or this was caused by the Epstein-Barr virus infection he came down with in August of 1998, which is when his blood pressure was elevated for the first time. An interesting website, if anyone is interested, is the National Dysautonomia Research Foundation at ndrf.org. The autonomic nervous system controls the blood pressure, heart rate, perspiration, pupils, bowel and bladder, and many other things over which we have no control. My son suffers from a multitude of problems with all of the things I have mentioned above except bladder. And he's only 15.I hope all of you have luck in finding an answer. I realize what it's like to live in what we not so fondly call \"autonomic hell.\"",
