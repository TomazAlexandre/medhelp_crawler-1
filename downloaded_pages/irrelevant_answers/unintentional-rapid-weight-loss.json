            "answer": "There are many causes of rapid weight loss but seldom this amount of weight in such a short period, unless fasting.\u00a0\u00a0Some of the more common causes would be a loss of fluid due to use of diuretics and/or laxatives, an overactive thyroid gland, eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia, chronic poisoning and probably the most common diabetes mellitus, commonly called sugar diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Weight loss can also be associated with some tumors but that is usually accompanied by a poor appetite.You should see your doctor as soon as you can and an exam and a few simple tests should quickly provide an answer.Good luck",
