            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to parasthesia which is due to dysfunctioning of neurons and can occur due to nerve irritation also. It can be due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency, neurological causes or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar, vitamin B 12 and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. Animal protein is the richest source of vitamin B 12 and if you are a vegetarian then you may be having vitamin B 12 deficiency. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms improve. If the symptoms persist then get an evaluation done from a physician and also get nerve conduction velocity tests done to rule out any nerve irritation.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your response.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a vegetarian, and had a recent work up with cardiologist due to some other issues, so I don't think this is vascular/circulation related (cardiologist said heart was strong & all looked good).\u00a0\u00a0I've been on the weight watchers program for about 10 months (have lost 40 lb with 45 more to reach my goal), so eating well and taking multivitamin for women, as well as additional calcium and omega supplements.\u00a0\u00a0thyroid tests over the past year or so (including nuclear scan) have been inconclusive (initially abnormal, then normal on further/more extensive tests). I am relieved to know there is no concern related to the IUD but will talk with my doctor about the nerve tests.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you again!",

    "question": "Hi - I'm 48 years old and I have noticed over the past couple of days numbness on the left side of my vagina/buttocks area. sorry for TMI - I noticed this as I was wiping after using the bathroom and could not feel that I was wiping along that one side. No issues with bladder/bowel control. I had started using a kegel exerciser/ben-wa ball about 2 weeks ago but had some bleeding/spotting with it so I stopped using it last week, and I don't know if any of this is related to the Mirena IUD I've had now for about 2 years.",
