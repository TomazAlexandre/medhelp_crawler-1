            "answer": "Having sudden fatigue, dizzyness and/or getting light headed could stem from being either hypoglycemia [low blood sugar] or hyperglycemia [high blood sugar]. BP is good so that is a plus.If your morning fasting levels are \"100 to 115\" you're considered impaired with prediabetes. Your A1c of 6.4% converts to an estimated daily glucose average of 137 mg/dl, high and in diabetes land. Better control of your blood sugars are needed by watching what you eat, drinks, lose excess weight [congrats on the 15lb loss], and perform daily 30-60 minutes of exercise.\"eat something on break, feel a little better, then 1 hour later start feeling diizzie light headed like, just real out of it.\"Eating foods high in carbohydrates [which turn into sugar rapidly] will cause a sudden sugar crash. What was it that you ate? Eating a proper diabetic diet low in carbohydrates is extremely important with avoiding having weird health symptoms.For diabetes analysis it is important to check your blood sugars at the proper times. Testing postprandial - 2 to 3 hrs after meal - provides an insight on how the foods you consumed affect your blood sugars. Your goal is to be at normal levels, 60/70 to 99 mg/dl. Type 2 diabetics on the other hand aim for <141 mg/dl, better yet <121 mg/dl. Testing earlier or later than the 2-3 hr window doesn't provide an accurate insight of your levels. If you can do this and also able test when you feel irregular it will provide us with better insight to help you further. Good luck -",
