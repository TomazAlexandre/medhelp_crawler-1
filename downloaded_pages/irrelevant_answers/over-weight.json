Just doing half weights that I was. I'm exercising heaps, 3-4 times a week for an hour, but still not a quarter of what I used to do and I'm huge. I was 68kg and 165cm b4. Now at 17 weeks I'm 78. Just try and keep your fitness up so that it comes off easily afterwards. GL.",

See if you feel good in swimming pool. Gently Walk or swim some laps and see how u go. One pang of pain and I'd pull up if I was you. Good luck.",

            "answer": "Sometimes the body has a way of balancing out things like this when you are pregnant. I know a few women, myself included that were slightly over weight when they got pregnant. Instead of gaining weight right away we all actually lost some or stayed about the same. As our pregnancies progressed we didn't gain as much as some women, but our babies grew perfect.I believe your biggest concern should be eating healthy and in reasonable moderation. Light exercise such as brisk walks should be fine, unless otherwise noted by your doc. I wouldn't go starting a regime of jumping jax and crunches if you weren't doing these thing prior to being pregnant. You can speak with your doc about your concerns and im sure he can help. he May even put ylu in touch with a nutritionist. I jab heard moms that had gestational diabetes say the diet they were put on helped them lose weight. Dont stress yourself and just focus on your health. And dont be down about it! Good luck :)",
