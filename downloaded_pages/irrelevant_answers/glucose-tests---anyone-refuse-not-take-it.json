            "answer": "Gestational diabetes is different from diabetes that you get from your relatives.\u00a0\u00a0It only lasts while you are pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0They just want to make sure your baby stays safe while in there.\u00a0\u00a0They certainly can't pin you down and force you to take the 3 hour test, but I'd still take it if I were you.\u00a0\u00a0Just pinch your nose when you swallow the liquid. :-)My friend BARELY failed her test and had to go on the special diet - no sugar, no carbs, etc for the remainder of her pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0She had to take her blood sugar every day too and not once did she have a problem with it - with her sugar that is - with the lack of good tasting food - maybe so.\u00a0\u00a0So, even if you do fail, the midwives don't live with you and won't be watching every little thing that you eat.\u00a0\u00a0(I always told her to cheat - LOL).But, at least if you take the 3 hour test, you'll know where you stand and if you even have gestational diabetes.",

            "answer": "Yeah. Im really confused as to why my office said the limit is 130, where as everywhere online the limit is 140. The chance of it being a \"false\" positive is THAT much higher.Ill just chat with my midwife and ask her why. I dont find a valid reason to take it. SAME THING HAPPENED with my first. DUMB me though didnt go online to research the \"normal\" limit.",

            "answer": "I didnt have gd with my first 2 pregnancies but also failed the 1 hr test so had to take the 3 n passed that. One thing they dont tell you is that stress will shoot your sugar levels up. My last preg i was border line gd and went on a controlled carb diet and was fine. This time tho im on a med and carb controlled diet. With gd they ( the dr) want to make sure you dont give birth to a 13 lb baby.... Ouch. And uncontrolled glucose levels can mess you up! Any ? Just ask. I found that chugging the sugar drink for 10 sec then waiting then 10 sec again made it go down the easiest.",

            "answer": "Hmmm...maybe it's a midwife limit? The clinic I went to was also 130 and they were midwifes as well. I would personally do it, but I'd imagine you could refuse the test if you really wanted to. They might make you sign forms and stuff saying you refused just encase something is wrong so you can't go back later and say it was there fault and such.",

You can refuse any and all medical testing. However it is always best to check for gestational diabetes for the baby's sake. Because you found the norm to be 140 or under definitely talk with your midwife about it and how uncomfortable you feel putting yourself through a 3-hour test when it is under the realm of norm for the rest of the country.",

Im guessing thats the reason why it came so close to the cut off. :P It *****. Ill talk to her. Good thing its 139! not anything above 140.",

They want it to be below 130 because GD causes the babies pancreas to have to work over time due to your not functioning properly. This can cause the babies heart to be over worked as well.I have had to do the 3 hr 3 times and I asked for mine to be put on ice. As long as you drink it within the time limit then the ice will not turn to water and dilute the solution. I always prefer the orange. I know it isn't comfortable, but isn't better off knowing that you are doing everything in your power to have a perfectly healthy baby?",

I have an appointment with my midwife and ill ask her to retake the one hour instead of doing the 3 hour as i did eat (forgot i wasnt supposed to)...

    "question": "SO Ill be blunt, I failed the one hour test. The normal range is supposedly 130 and under, I was 139.With DD I had the SAME thing happen I failed by a few, took the 3 hr and the three hr test came back fine. My question is DO I HAVE TO TAKE IT? Is it something that is required?For the record:NO ONE in my family immidiate/cousins has diabetes.I never had problems with sugarWith DD I didnt have diabetes, and the test results for the one hour were a bit above normal like this.I dont find the need to retake it, I gagged from the 50mg... Im imagining Ill definatly puke with the 100mg test. If I do puke at the three hour test, Ill be told you have to retake it. I will not keep retaking a 3 hour test. I do have a 3 yr old, who needs to be watched.ANY INFORMATION WOULD BE LOVELY.oh and i keep reading online that anything above 140 requires the 3 hr test. How come my midwives office said 130?",
