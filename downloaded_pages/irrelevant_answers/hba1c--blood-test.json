            "answer": "Hi there,You're A1c test is not a fasting test, BUT usually when you go to your endo. or phys. to get labs done, especially if you have diabetes, they will most likely want to do a cholesterol test, which IS a fasting test. This test will be very good info for keeping up with your overall health. If I were you, I would just skip breakfast or lunch, whatever is closer to your app.",
