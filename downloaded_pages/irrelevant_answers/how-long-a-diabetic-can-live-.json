Does it mean everything has been OK ? No, far from it. Diabetes has mainly affected my heart so I have had bypass surgery, have a week heart and implanted with a pacemaker. My kidneys, eyes, feet\u00a0\u00a0are OK so far. Was I to blame for anything ? Could be. I have not followed instructions from Doctors on\u00a0\u00a0diet, exercise and correct dose of insulin religiously. IGetting back to your original question, there are cases of people diagnosed in their childhood surviving into their 70s and 80s. With regular check ups, correct diet, medicine and exercise, you as a newly diagnosed person should have near normal life expectancy.I wish you a long and healthy life",

            "answer": "Namaste Anjani,This is what I wrote on a different post of yours.It answers your questions to some degreeBy all means, control what you eat, do regular exercise,\u00a0\u00a0but if that does not work then don't hesitate to ask your doctor about taking an appropriate medicine ( For example, metformin) . I have been on insulin for 23 years and lead a near normal life. With diabetes, checking your blood sugars on a regular basis is important. Since you are from India, I would also regularly get blood pressure and cholesterol levels checked because we Indian are prone to metabolic syndrome where blood sugar, lipids and blood pressure are all elevated and leads to a number of problems.Specific diet changes 1. when it comes to rotis, do not sieve the flour. If possible add extra bran. The chapati may not look appetizing but the fiber in the bran will slow done sugar absorption. Reduce consumption of refined carbohydrates such as white rice, sabu dana. Chana dal causes the lowest increase in blood sugar level so consider increasing that and other dals in your diet. avoid eating in restaurants because there you are not in control as how much flour or sugar they are adding to their recipes\u00a0\u00a0See number 3 below also.2. Avoid fried foods like bhajiya or samosas.3. If possible , start carbohydrate counting. You may need to buy a basic food weighing scale in order to measure raw materials going into your curries and their carbohydrate count. The net has number of sites which can help in calculation. A nutritionist will help you too.4. See whether you can get /afford a blood glucose testing kit. Doing it yourself helps achieve better control rather than going once every six month to the doctor to get it done.Best of health.",

            "answer": "I commend your efforts to control sugar using diet and exercise, however, if that does not work there is nothing wrong in taking medicines. Keeping your sugar high may lead years later ( 20-30 years) to serious complications related to kidney, heart feet or eyes.I have been taking insulin for 23 years and lead near normal life.\u00a0\u00a0Us\u00a0\u00a0indians usually hate taking medicines. I have forgotten how many times people have asked me why\u00a0\u00a0take insulin, instead take desi dawa. I am sure without insuln , I would either be dead or seriously crippled. In your case tablets may work. However, your doctor would know what to prescribe.",
