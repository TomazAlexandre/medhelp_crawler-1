Not just looking for glucose in his urine.The eye problems are also a concern and not normal.Also, high calcium is never normal.I can't really advise much except there is obviously something wrong and you are right to be agressive in folloiwng this up.",

I will be sure to push the issue if he tries to say it is nothing though.\u00a0\u00a0Doe that mean if it is hyperparathyroidism he should see an endocrinoligist?pepperderr",

    "question": "How common is hyperparathyroid in a 10yo?\u00a0\u00a0I took my 10yo son to the doc yesterday mostly because he was peeing so much....often and a lot at one time.\u00a0\u00a0He sometimes seems to drink a lot and other times no.\u00a0\u00a0His vision went from 20/50 to 20/200 in a few months time.\u00a0\u00a0Of course he is a growing boy so you never can tell is he always starving because he is growing or from something else.They said there is no sugar in the urine so they don't think it is diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He said it is likely not diabetes becasue it has been going on for a few months and he seems otherwise fine.\u00a0\u00a0The doc didn't seem to think it was much.\u00a0\u00a0He said maybe it is just habit.\u00a0\u00a0He agreed to do a kidney blood test even though he didn't seem to think it would show anything.To me I am glad we struggled and got the blood tests done.\u00a0\u00a0Believe me, he was NOT cooperative.\u00a0\u00a0I checked the blood test results online yesterday and it showed higher blood ionized calcium than normal.\u00a0\u00a0He did other blood tests including a vitamin D test only because I asked him to because my other son's vitamin D is so low.\u00a0\u00a0The vitimin D and other tests are not back yet...well, they are not showing up online yet.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if his doctor isn't in today or what.\u00a0\u00a0They did:BASIC METAB PANEL, BMPCBC/DIFFCULTURE QUANT URINE25-HYDROXY VITAMIN DCALCIUM, IONIZEDWhat I read is the if blood calcium is high is it probably because the parathyroid gland isn't wroking right even if it is just a little high.\u00a0\u00a0His is 1.39 with 1.32 considered high normal.So they will probably do a parathyroid test next right? and if that is abnormal it is hyperparathyroidism?\u00a0\u00a0I am trying to figure out if i should persue it any further if he does for some reason say it is only a little high it is probably ok or his vitamin D is normal he is probably ok.\u00a0\u00a0To me even if it is only a little high the fact that he is peeing so much is showing symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0He also had stomach pain the night before I took him to the doc.\u00a0\u00a0He was not nervous or anything becuase I didn't tell him I was making an appointment but we have no idea what the stomach pain was.\u00a0\u00a0He was actually doubled over for a bit but it did eventually go away.\u00a0\u00a0Of course this may be a coincidence but I want to know why do they say hyperparathyroidism can cause stomach pain?\u00a0\u00a0What is it doing to the stomach?\u00a0\u00a0Might this by why his eyes went so bad?\u00a0\u00a0Why does it cause eye problems?Is there anything else you can share about this problem that maybe I should know espeicially if the doctor says it is probably nothing.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.pepperderr",
