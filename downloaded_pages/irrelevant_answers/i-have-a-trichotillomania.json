            "answer": "It falls under the OCD spectrum disorder and yes, you have developed this habit and you are doing it under times of stress.\u00a0\u00a0And since it is a habit, you are doing it unconsciously.\u00a0\u00a0I know you don't want to talk to your parents but I think you are going to have to.\u00a0\u00a0Trust me, no parent wants to see their child suffer and if you are wearing a wig then the habit has gotten out of hand, your self-esteem is suffering, and your anxiety is going unchecked.\u00a0\u00a0So please talk to your parents.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't mean you are crazy or weird because if you are then so are the rest of us and I don't consider myself crazy or weird.\u00a0\u00a0You have a disorder not unlike say diabetes for instance where you don't have enough neurotransmitters in your brain for you to handle situations like this.\u00a0\u00a0So please talk to your parents about seeing a psychologist so that you can get the help you need and deserve.\u00a0\u00a0Take care.",
