            "answer": "Hi,Your diabetes educator may recommend different levels as target depending on your treatment goals.Just so you know, people without diabetes do not have blood sugars higher than 140 2 hours after eating and most will be considerably lower (< 120, or evening in the range of 80 - 100).If you eat lower carb / avoid sugars, you may find you can also achieve lower post eating numbers. It will be best to have numbers as close to non-diabetic as you can safely achieve.",

            "answer": "Its only been a year since I've found out I have type 2. I went from a glucose 326 to 110 to 102 (my last checkup in November). Sometimes I feel weak and I'll eat or snack on something I probably shouldn't. I take my meds like I'm supposed to. The dr said it was safe to start trying for a family. I'm really scared about being diabetic and also becoming pregnant. I've lost 30-35 lbs last year and have kept it off. I need to go back for another check up to see how I'm doing. This is not easy!!",

            "answer": "Diabetes is complicated and you should not change your therapy just based on one number. Also when you had 102 also makes it different: morning fasting, or 3am, or before the bed, etc.Diabetes is a complicated disease so you really want to discuss with your CDE, and if they say 160, ask them why, why not 140 as an example.",

        {
            "answer": "Also feeling weak could mean you were experiencing hypoglycemia. Dropping from 326 to 103 is significant. Many oral drugs in fact cause hypoglycemia. So again you want to talk to your HCP to really understand your glucose control. Consider doing 4-7 BGs a day for 3-5 days in a role, or a continuous glucose morning evaluation.",
