            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your father. According to new MRI report, the area of brain supplied by middle cerebral artery and posterior communicating artery shows small areas of poor blood supply not receiving oxygen. This means there is narrowing of MCA-PCA. Further occlusion can precipitate stroke. Also, if the BP is not monitored then a very high spike in BP can cause stroke.In addition your father probably has postural hypotension. The blood pressure falls when a person stands from a sitting position or gets up from a lying down position and causes dizziness. Dehydration, certain medications, heart problems, untreated or uncontrolled diabetes, and nervous system disorders can all cause this. TIAs or transient ischemic attacks can also be the cause. In your father\u2019s case the fluctuation in BP could be due to a combination of the above mentioned causes.Blood pressure monitoring, tilt table test, EKG, heart echo, ambulatory blood pressure recording are all required for diagnosis. Other than this his blood pressure and blood sugar needs to be properly monitored to avoid further fainting or dizziness due to these causes. Also, this may help slow down the progression towards another stroke.Please discuss in detail with your father\u2019s treating specialists. He needs careful monitoring to avoid further mishaps.I sincerely hope you will find this information useful in your journey towards better health for your father. Good Luck and take care!",

            "answer": "No, Alzheimer's/Parkinson are neurodegenerative disorders and not ischemic in origin. Subacute ischemic change cannot be reversed but the damage can be controlled by treating the underlying cause like plaque, kinking, atherosclerosis etc.",
