            "answer": "Well since I've been pregnant this time around I have had problems with my heart racing really fast never had this before until now and when I went to a cardiologist he said it was because of pregnancy so I'm guessing because your body is working harder to carry baby pumping more blood maybe that's why your heart rate is high but just check out a cardiologist to see what they say your doc can send you a referral and insurance pays for it",

            "answer": "I was being told for the longest my baby was measuring big and when I went in for a ultrasound due to gestational diabetes she was actually measuring smaller than she should be and yesterday she's measuring right on point so I guess babies just go through different growing stages",

    "question": "#1: my doc has been telling me at every appt that my baby seems to be measuring big, so I finally asked today how big she thought he would be and she said bigger than my last 2 which were 7lbs. My question is, has anyone been told this? She hasn't done an ultrasound or anything she just measures my stomach.#2: when I went to the hospital the other night for cramping, they kept me for an hour because my heart rate was 132. They said that's really high, it went down and they sent me home. But today at my appt it was 128. That still seems high, so my obgyn wants me to see my pcp to have my heart checked because she doesn't know why it's so high. Anyone else had high heart rate or anything with no medical problems? I'm 34 weeks so if I can I would like to try and make it through the rest of the pregnancy without any hassles or anything. Appreciate any comments thanks mom's and congrats on all of u and ur pregnancies and babies\u2661",
