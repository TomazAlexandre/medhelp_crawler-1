            "answer": "There is a link between having Type I Diabetes (the autoimmune type - typical of children and adolescents) and a three fold higher risk of developing MS.\u00a0\u00a0This does not apply to the more common Type II Diabetes which is characterized by insulin resistance.Therre is also about a 44% higher risk for close relatives of a person with MS to develop Diabetes Type I.This higher risk between the two is clearly due to a genetic predisposition.The info to take away from this is that if you have Type I (only) Diabetes you have about a 1 in 250+ chance of developing MS rather than the national average of 1 in 800.This is historically kind of interesting, because before a few years ago, it was thought that Type I Diabetes and MS were mutually exclusive because of their associated tissue typing.Live and learn.Quix",
