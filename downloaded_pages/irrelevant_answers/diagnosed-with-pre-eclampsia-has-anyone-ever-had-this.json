            "answer": "geez girliee..you and I arent having it easyare we? you with pre eclampsia and me with gestational diabetes....well, my friend had the pre eclampsia and she was fine....I have seen a lot of birth shows with it, basically it should be ok but if it gets too high or out of hand people can sometime be put on bed rest in the hospital till the baby can be delivered......but it doesnt sound like yours is that bad. They prob will be inducing you earlier(37-38 weeks) because delivering the baby cures you, so when shes ready im sure they will take her out, lol....",

Plus there is always the chance that the diabetes wont go away...which really *****.\u00a0\u00a0but i'm sure we will both get through just fine and in 4- 5 weeks we will be holding our little girls in our arms...I got my c-section date its Sept 10, so 5 weeks away!

And he was just fine but died due to a catheter piercing his heart. I would make sure you are seeing someone who is experienced with high risk pregnancies but even if you delivered tomorrow you would have an excellent chance of having a perfectly healthy baby",

    "question": "I was just diagnosed with Pre-Eclampsia last week. My doctor has me on bed rest and is monitoring my BP and weight weekly. I am scared and I don't know a lot about this condition. I don't have protein in my urine, but my BP has been a bit high and I have extreme pitting edema in my feet, ankles, and legs.\u00a0\u00a0My hands, face, thighs, and knees are also really swollen. I am 33 weeks 4 days. My doctor said something about bed rest until the baby can be taken in 4 weeks. Does that mean she plans on inducing labor at about 37-38 weeks? Has anyone else had this and can give me their stories? Thanks.",
