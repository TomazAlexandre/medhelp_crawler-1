            "answer": "I was borderline with my first pregnancy and I had to control it with diet. I was also put on almost strict bed rest so I couldn't do any exercises. My husband also worked all the time and we only had one car so I couldn't go to the specialist to get medication to control. I had a shortening in my cervix so I ended up delivering my daughter a little early. She was 7lb 5.5 oz at 37 weeks. Of I went full term she probably would have been 9 lbs or so",
