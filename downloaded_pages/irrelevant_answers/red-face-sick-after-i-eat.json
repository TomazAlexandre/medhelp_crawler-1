            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for your questions. Common causes of red face (facial flushing) during eating are stress (post surgery stress), heartburn (gastritis), excess alcohol use and spicy food. However, certain disorder like diabetes is also associated with red face due to neuropathy development. All these factors need to be considered for a thorough evaluation of your condition. Please consult a neurologist for a physical examination and complete assessment in order to reach at appropriate diagnosis here. Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your response. I never had this problem until I had umbilical hernia surgery so, naturally, it does raise questions for me. I do not drink alcohol and do not eat spicy foods. When I eat small amounts of food or have a glass of water, the flush face comes followed by an overall sick feeling.It starts with pressure around my brain before I get sick. I have to lay down to work it out. I am a male over 50 years old. I did have a breathing tube during surgery and thought I might have a problem with my esophagus which was scoped and fine. I have had a CT scan, gallbladder and kidney ultra sound, multiple blood tests, gastroparesis test, stress test, colonoscopy, esophageal scope, and all were okay.I had a hydrogen breath test which had bacterial overgrowth in my small intestine and was treated with antibiotic. Medical professionals have questioned nerve damage with the medication used during anesthesia or possibly infectious etiology. My problem still continues, and I am determined to get my quality of life back.",

    "question": "I had surgery last October.\u00a0\u00a0Since surgery I get a sick feeling after I eat.\u00a0\u00a0Pressure starts in my head and I get an overall sick feeling.\u00a0\u00a0Some days are really bad.\u00a0\u00a0My face turns red and appears shinny.\u00a0\u00a0I am diabetic and have checked my sugar and blood pressure numbers which are fine during these episodes.\u00a0\u00a0I have had so many tests and all have come back negative. The neurologist is thinking it may be nerve problems in the brain. My internist is thinking it is related related to diabetic neuropathy. I have never had this feeling before surgery. It is more of a sick feeling not just nausea.\u00a0\u00a0Hope someone can help!DB",
