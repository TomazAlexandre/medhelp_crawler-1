            "answer": "Hi.Have you been assessed for any vitamin and mineral deficiencies? How about diabetes?Some vitamin and mineral deficiencies, such as those involving vitamin B12 and magnesium, have been associated with muscle fasciculations, among other symptoms. Diabetes can also cause these symptom as part of diabetic neuropathy.Some other tests that could be done to determine or rule out amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis include muscle biopsy, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, visual evoked response, somatosensory evoked potentials, and brain stem auditory evoked responses.Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Hi.Most knee implants that have been recently manufactured adhere to strict manufacturing and safety criteria. As such, the implants are mostly biocompatible and can be implanted and function in the human body without causing any local or systemic rejection response.It would be unusual and highly unlikely that a rejection response has only occurred two and a half years after implantation.Hope this answers your query.",

    "question": "I am a 50 yr old woman. Very Active, biking, swimming and spinning (indoor biking classes).2.5 yrs ago had an artificial knee replacement. January of 2007 I started occasional fasciculation\u2019s in the calf of my leg with the artificial knee. At the time my orthopedic surgeon said it was my varicose veins due to the trauma from my surgery. I was good with that simple diagnosis until Sept 07. The involuntary muscle fasciations moved from the leg with the artificial joint to both legs and was now bi--lateral in both calf\u2019s below my knees. These fasciations have not stopped since 9/07. A form of personal internal torture!Here the tests I have had done. EMG diagnosis inconclusive. MRI (2) looking for MS. They did not find MS but 2nd MRI\u00a0\u00a0found what they are calling \"a cause of unknown significant\". An area that they don\u2019t know what it is. I have 2 neurosurgical appointments lined up for opinions on the brain issue.The leg fasciations I was told I must see a neuromuscular specialist. I have not gotten that referral yet. But it will be at the University of Syracuse Hospital in the neuro muscular department.I have been told that ALS can\u00a0\u00a0not be ruled out and probally MSI have been tested negative for the following:Lyme diseaseLupusCancerThyroidANA PanalI would love any additional information that\u2019s out there. Opinions or other people with similar circumstances.AnnNichols NY",
