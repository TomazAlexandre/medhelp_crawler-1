            "answer": "I'm not sure I understand what kind of help you want. Maybe someone else does...?I can only try and explain the situation, which you maybe already understand. So, if you say he's type 1, that means that his immune system has destroyed part of pancreas that produces insulin. Rest of pancreas is still intact. This probably happened because his immune system identified the insulin as an enemy and destroyed the source of it. Why it suddenly sees it as an enemy is still a mystery. This is irreversible, so now his body is not producing insulin anymore.Insulin is needed, to put it simple, to lower the blood glucose level once it goes above the point the body would like it to be. Now, blood glucose comes exclusively from eating carbohydrates. If you eat only fat and protein, you don't need insulin. Since his body doesn't produce insulin anymore, he either needs to get it from outside sources, or completely stop eating carbohydrates. There's no other way around it.Having blood glucose levels two or three times above the limit for many years will almost certainly lead to other quite serious issues.",
