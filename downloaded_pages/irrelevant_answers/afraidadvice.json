            "answer": "Well i cant tell you what to do but ill tell you what I did. Like you, I could not hold down the drink and threw up everytime, nearly passed out, and my baby wasnt moving much afterwards whuch scared me. I refused to go back to repeat the test and so my doctor ordered a blood test called a \"hemoglobin A1C\". Results came back normal. Remember you have every right to say no and hopefully you can ask about doing blood test instead. Take care",

            "answer": "What were your scores per hour? I'm hypoglycemic, it was confirmed after the 3 hour test my last pregnancy and I suffered thru the test. It was awfully rough for me and I almost passed out walking back to my car after it. Luckily I packed some trail mix in my bag .... anyways Im able to.manage my blood sugar on my own. And I'm refusing the test this time because I know I don't have diabetes. It is possible you have either gestational diabetes or hypoglycemia. Depends on how low your blood sugar drops at the last blood draw...",

    "question": "I have been having issues with my blood sugar the entirety of my pregnancy. I have been through both a 1hr and a 3hr Glucose tolerance test. Both of them made me really sick, hurt my arms and put my baby girl in distress. My doctor wants me to do another 3hr at my next appointment and I'm terrified. I don't want to put myself and baby girl through that again. What should I do?",
