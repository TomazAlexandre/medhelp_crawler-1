            "answer": "Hi there,Sorry to hear of your friend\u2019s troubles; he\u2019s fortunate to have someone around him that\u2019s concerned.There are a number of folks in there that have undergone antiviral therapy with early stage 4 cirrhosis; hopefully some of them will stop by to share their own experiences. Thrombocytopenia (low platelets) is probably the biggest challenge when treating cirrhotic patients; often their platelets are already reduced as a result of liver disease, and the interferon has a tendency to further reduce them as well.Diabetes is not unexpected either; it\u2019s been suggested that HCV/liver disease hastens the onset of diabetes type II. There are a number of us that don\u2019t fit the classic type II DM profile that developed it perhaps as a result of HCV.From a caretaker\u2019s perspective, you\u2019re friend will likely minimally experience fatigue. He might also develop varying degrees of anxiety/depression, however this can often be managed with antidepressants/anxiolytics.\u00a0\u00a0Not everyone experiences depression; but it does occur.Try to help him remain compliant with meds, even on days when he doesn\u2019t feel like taking them; compliance is critical to long term success. You might also ask if you can accompany him to doctor appointments; it\u2019s often nice to have a second set of ears\u2026 doctors often don\u2019t have a lot of time to repeat instructions, etc.Yes, he may loose appetite and food may take on a metallic taste; prepare hot/spicy foods with caution.Other\u2019s will likely offer advice as well. Welcome to the discussion group,--Bill",

            "answer": "I have lots of experience as the care taker.\u00a0\u00a0Bill gave you lots of good information above.\u00a0\u00a0You read a lot about the people that have bad side effects when you are on the forum because they have more to write about.\u00a0\u00a0Many people have minimal difficulties.Unfortunately, my husband was one to have the bad effects so I did all I could to shoulder the load while he was treating.\u00a0\u00a0He didn't immediately get OK after stopping either so it meant carrying the load for a long time.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully your friend will be a good responder to the meds and won't have much trouble.\u00a0\u00a0I would go in with a positive attitude but ready to do more than your share as needed to keep the stress off of your friend as much as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Fatigue is a very common problem and it usually comes and goes in intensity during treatment (TX)\u00a0\u00a0Total compliance to shot and meds schedule is so important.\u00a0\u00a0I usually kept track of all of that for my husband and just delivered to him what ever he needed.\u00a0\u00a0I also had to make food and water really convenient for him because he felt bad enough that he'd just skip it rather than get it himself.\u00a0\u00a0TX seems to really alter people's tastes and some foods you normally like, just don't taste good until you stop the meds.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully, you won't even need any of this information.\u00a0\u00a0It just doesn't hit everyone the same.Make sure you are home when the first shot is taken.\u00a0\u00a0My husband was so sure it wouldn't bother him, he took his first shot at the Dr.'s office and instead of making the long drive home, he went to the bookstore and I went to the grocery store and came back for him. His first shot hit him hard and he liked to have died before I got back...learn from the dumbies:>)\u00a0\u00a0Some people don't have any symptom at all with the first shot but just in case...you want to be home.Ask questions as you need answers.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of people here will help.Best wishes,Ev",

            "answer": "hello, sorry about your friend.I haven't been on this site for a LONG time, but saw your post and wanted to add a few things.It will be most important for him to eat with his ribas or he can get tummy upsets.Best if possible for him to do shots at night so that he'll sleep through worst side affects (take paracetanol) .He must drink LOTS of water, this is so important as the TX really dries you out.Water will help to stop headaches.Yes he may need anti depressants as the Ifn messes with your brain.Try to help minimise stress around him, and he will be very tired a lot of the time also.I've been through Tx\u00a0\u00a03 times now so I've learned a bit through my own mistakes!But my husband treated with Cirrhosis and got through tx with almost no sides and SVR'd !! so some are lucky!!Good luck with it all, he's lucky to have you to care for him.All the best,OZgirl x",
