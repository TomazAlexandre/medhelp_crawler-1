            "answer": "Teak,Thank you so much for the answer. I'm not sure if you read my story but I had mulitple protected intercourses throughout one night with someone that I don't know. I started worrying because I thought - what if the condom broke? It was dark in the room and I didn't see much and could have missed a broken condom. There was also a brief oral contact with my penis for about 3-5 seconds. And now I have this irritation / rash on my penis and that is worrying me a lot now. Because this could be an indication that condom did in fact break and I could have contracted this from her and if it did break - there is a risk of HIV as well.What do you think about this? I'm really worried.It's been 27 days from that encounter. I had dry mouth since that time and some discomfort in the throat. Maybe those were part of ARS? No fever. I just hope that that's due to anxiety.aak001, thanks for your answer as well.",

            "answer": "Hi,I have the same questions, however, im unable to find the answers Dr Hook has provided.Im a 27 year old male. My condom broke during vaginal intercourse with a CSW. However, I replaced it and continued with the act.Around 5 weeks to the date, I have developed, severe itching, whitish creamy film / discharge on the penile head. Is this a yeast infection? No fever, no sore throat.1. If this is yeast infection - it could only be contracted, right? (I don't take any antibiotics nor do I have diabetes). If that's the case then my fear that condom broke during the the intercourse might be true.2. Is penile east infection a part of ARS or early HIV infection?3. Could this rush be related to HIV / ARS rush?4. Could she pass it to me during a brief 3-5 second oral contact with my penis if she had oral thrush?5. Can this be herpes? (it's been 38 days from the incident)I'm very worried about this. Thank you very much.Ive been trying to locate the answers, however, im unable to do so, request your assistance in\u00a0\u00a0the same.",

    "question": "Dr. Hook,If you remember I asked you about redness on the head of my penis (and now I noticed redness and scaly area on the inside of my foreskin). No itching. I've read a few things and asked a few questions on dermatology forum and from what I understand I might have a balanitis or penile yeast infection. I have a few questions about it, I'd appreciate it if you could answer them:1. If this is yeast infection - it could only be contracted, right? (I don't take any antibiotics nor do I have diabetes). If that's the case then my fear that condom broke during the the intercourse might be true.2. Is penile east infection a part of ARS or early HIV infection?3.
