I'm 26y.o. and like you, only know some health history...I know my mama's (mostly back and wrist and knee trouble), some of my biological father(pancreatic cancer now) and his dad(diabetes)-his mom don't go to doctors (she says), and some of my mama's mom(lung problems). And when it comes to roots....I don't know much more... As of now, I know that my great-grandfather was full-blooded Cherokee (Bowmans). And I think there is some Viking, and Iroquois and Chippewa some where .....So, I'm Heinz 57...but my hubby likes to say I'm Melungeon! LOL.....maybe so. It's hard not knowin', and I am not gonna' put my kids in the same situation (dysfunctional families, whatever.), so that they will know where to look when they need somethin'. Anyway, I tend to get excited over things and ramble on and on.....But I noticed your heritage thing and thought I'd make a connection!Take care,(((Raynbow",

Even if the tests come up positive it isn't clear that the disease will express itself and 3. The psychology of knowing a test is positive and living your life waiting for the desease to express itself (which it may never do) is a pretty hard way to live a life.I'm not sure your situation warrants testing due to the distance of your relatives who have CA to your daughters.2 cents.Louana",
