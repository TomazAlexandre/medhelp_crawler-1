    "question": "So I'm 24 weeks today. I went to the dr yesterday and had an ECO done on the baby because I'm diabetic (i was diabetic before i got pregnant) and my dr said when your diabetic your baby is at a higher risk for heart defects..Well everything came back normal but he's kind of a big baby. He weighs 1pound 8 oz and is in the 66th percentile. So my question is, has anyone had large babies due to diabetes? And did they have any trouble trying to control your babys glucose? Just wanting to hear other mothers experiences because I'm a ftm.",
