I don't mean to sound lame, but a good walk can go a long way when ur building up any negative feelings. Take care... I'm stil in tx so I'm curious about post SE. Karen :)",

            "answer": "I had similar anger challenges last TX. Just started again last week and this time my therapist said I can't use TX as an excuse for things like that. It has been helpful to think about it that way, especially for my wife who go most of my temper last time. I also take a very small dose of remeron every night which is very helpful and fine with my Dr.Exercise is helpful too, I'm sticking with handball as long as possible.",

    "question": "Read alot of posts. Anger does not seem to be a big problem with post tx. When I was on it I got really angry about dumb stuff. I could feel the anger building inside and would explode. Not violent just ugly yelling. I don't drug or drink and 8yrs later I still well up and burst. Sometimes once a month. It is not normal.\u00a0\u00a0Not alot of joint pain like I read about. though last night while in a deep sleep it felt like all my joints locked up. I squeezed out of it. It was weird. Now thinking a mild anti depressant may work . I don't know. Have Diabetes also and do get depressed. Any help or experience with this would be appreciated.",
