    "question": "Okay, yesterday at Thanksgiving we were hanging out with family and my uncle - who is a diabetic - had a diabetes testing monitor. Several family members were checking their blood sugar with this finger pricker monitor. I have suspected that my blood sugar is a little high, so I tried this test as well.Afterward, I got really nervous. Though he changes the finger pricker after each person, I was concerned that maybe it didn't get changed. I have no reason to believe that any family member (1) has any disease to be concerned about or (2) that the pricker wasn't changed after the last person who used it.I know it was stupid to share this monitor...and I also know that I tend to be OVERLY paranoid. Does anyone know if there are ANY substantial risks to be concerned about? Sorry if I sound a little ridiculous, but I have a tendency toward anxiety and this is really upsetting me right now...Any advice / information would be most appreciated...",
