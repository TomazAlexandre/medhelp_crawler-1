            "answer": "No interferon and ribavirin is not a guaranteed cure but at the moment is the only\u00a0\u00a0available treatment and whether there are side effects or not it shouldnt be dismissed without thought. Other more promising therapies are not too far away from approval but in the meantime try to make sure your mother lives as healthy a life as possible in terms of diet, exercise etc and no alcohol.Am sure you will get many replies offering support and advice.Good luck",

That is why we are willing to go through a treatment that makes us feel so sick for so long... because we want the virus out of our bodies and right now there is only one way to do it.",
