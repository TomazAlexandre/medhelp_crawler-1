            "answer": "Regarding the armpit odor, some medications can cause this.\u00a0\u00a0If there has been a change in your medication regimen since before surgery, that might have something to do with it.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I googled the problem and found that diabetes, renal disease, and other medical problems can cause a change in armpit odor.Regarding the color of your birthmark, I don't have any idea what that could be about.\u00a0\u00a0It does sound like your surgery was a big shock to your system, and so maybe there are some body-wide reverberations that are still going on.\u00a0\u00a0Aortic arch surgery is one of the biggest, most traumatic operations you can have, so in that sense it's not really surprising that the recovery has been complicated.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't mean taht you're not going to be okay in the end.\u00a0\u00a0It just means that the operation you had was a huge one.I hope you are being followed closely by a doctor with whom you can share everything that is going on and that you can get some answers.\u00a0\u00a0It might also be worth calling Dr. Coselli's office and talking to his nurse, to see if any of your ongoing problems ring any bells with her.",

            "answer": "It is unlikely that the armpit odor change and skin color change is due to the surgery itself although you noticed them after surgery.\u00a0\u00a0You should consult your physician about these changes.\u00a0\u00a0It is possible they are secondary to new medications you are taking.",
