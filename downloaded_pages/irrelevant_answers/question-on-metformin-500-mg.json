            "answer": "\"my fasting levels are 9 times higher than normal\"Your levels are in the 900 mg/dl [50 mmol/l] range? That is a deadly level to be at. Please take the time and educate yourself about diabetes control, management and diets. Also, perform 30 minutes of physical daily exercise, like walking, to help lower your glucose levels. Ask your doctor for a referral to a diabetes educator/class and a diabetes nutritionist/dietician to help you understand what to eat and what not to eat, portion sizes, etc.\" what side effects are there?\"Some of the most common side effects are nausea, diarrhea, indigestion, and headaches. I suggest you use Google to search on 'Metformin side effects'.By the way, most people do not experience any side effects so please put your fear aside. What you should be really afraid of is type 2 diabetes sides effects. If you ignore getting this disease under control and managed they will arise and take over your life. Good luck.",
