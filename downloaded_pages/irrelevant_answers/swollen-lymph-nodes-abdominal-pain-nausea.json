            "answer": "I am NOT a doctor, but I did experience similar systems when I contracted Mono. I noticed the swollen lymphs nodes after my boyfriend kissed me goodnight on the cheek, and it was strangely painful.When I went to the bathroom and looked closer I counted 13 swollen lymph nodes they were behind both ears, on the side of my face, throat and neck area, and under my arms.The next morning at the doctors office I counted 20, and eventually they moved down to my groin.I had some abdominal pain, and a complete loss of appetite. If your pain persists or worsens I would absolutely seek professional care ( For example mostUrgent Care facilities will accept most insurance, and no appointment is needed, that is where I went) especially because of your already present conditions. If not I would wait until your appointment.Hope this helps.",

    "question": "A few days ago I noticed a hard bump behind one ear. For the last few weeks I have had abdominal pain, crampy and sometimes sharp(on my right side). I have fibromyalgia so I'm used to pain & sometimes it's hard for me to know when something's wrong but this feels different. I've never had a swollen lymph node behind my ear & I've never had this sharp kind of stabbing abdominal pain. I've also had a lot of nausea & loss of appetite. I also have borderline diabetes & don't know if this can be related to that. I worry about lymphoma & gastrointestinal cancer(my father, grandmother, & 2 uncles died from colon cancer). I can't get an appointment at the doctor for two weeks. Do you think I should seek any urgent care before that? I am a 42 year old female by the way.",
