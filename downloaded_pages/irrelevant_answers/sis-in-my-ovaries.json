            "answer": "Dear amatullah,PCOS means polycystic ovarian syndrome. That means that both ovaries have multiple small cysts. Cyst just means fluid with a skin over ti - think of a blister. In PCOS, the cysts are ovarian follicles. that means , around each egg cell there is a circle of cells called follicular cells that produce hormones. Those cells help mature the egg. Every month one egg is selected to mature and to ovulate - that is to pop out of the ovary. In PCOS, ovulation rarely occurs but multiple egg cells with follicle cysts around them develop. There are also alot of other hormone related issues with PCOS such as the higher chance of developing diabetes.It is good that you are seeing a doctor for guidancetake care",
