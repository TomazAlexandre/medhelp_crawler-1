            "answer": "Here's my 2 cents; For short periods fad diets work for a few people and fail with everyone else. The Glycemic Index [GI] has shown to be the guide for proper eating. Considering your food allergies you will have pick through the GI to find your right choices, and something I don't believe a nutritionist nor a dietitian can do better than yourself. http://www.glycemicindex.com/ .\"My blood glucose at that time was 102mg/dl.\u00a0\u00a0Is that high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes?This is usually considered borderline diabetes. By borderline I mean the same blood sample can result in a \u00b1 [plus/minus] swing of 5 mg/dl either way. So your 102 could have been a 97 mg/dl making you normal. But, the fact is you're still teetering on borderline diabetes. Glucose levels are:Normal is 70-99 mg/dlprediabetes 100-122 mg/dltype 2 diabetes above 124 mg/dlSo what should you do? The best test is called an A1c [HbA1c or hemoglobin A1c]. The A1c measures the average amount of glucose in your blood stream going back 3 months. Why go back 3 months? In short, new red blood cells live on average 3 months. Excess glucose binds to these new red cells until they die off. The A1c captures this and your results are presented in % [percentile]. Some labs say <7% while others have <6% [< = less than] being normal. Here's a link explaining the test http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003640.htmControlling and managing your glucose can be accomplished with proper foods, maintaining weight, stress management, proper amount of sleep, and moderate exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Ask your doctor for good reliable home glucose test meter such as the Johnson & Johnson One Touch system. Test right before meals to get a baseline measurement and 2-3 hours after a meal when glucose in foods you're eaten reach their highest level in your blood stream. The latter is the best indicator of what foods do to your levels. Reduce or avoid those that do, increase those that do not. Pretty simple.",

            "answer": "Our post crossed paths. Splenda [succralose] is sugar based but with an atom removed so it doesn't get absorbed in your intestines. Stevia is derived from a plant leaf and used in asian foods. It has an artificial sweetness flavor that some people enjoy while others dislike. Both are way better than aspartame.Honey is definitely a no-no as it contains natural sugar: 1 Tbsp has 16 grams of sugar. Every 7 grams is equal to one heaping Tbsp of refined sugar. Google a food with the word nutrition following to get the sugar contents. ie; honey nutrition.When consuming natural sugars [fruits] eat them with other foods to slow the absorption of glucose entering the body.",

    "question": "My eye doctor today told me that my vision problems are due to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I told him that I have never been diagnosed with diabetes by a medical doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I had fasting labs done a few months ago because of hypothyroid.\u00a0\u00a0My blood glucose at that time was 102mg/dl.\u00a0\u00a0Is that high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes? I already have another appointment for fasting labs next month.I thought I would get a jump start on changing my eating habits but I can't figure out what I can eat.\u00a0\u00a0Everytime I try to follow one of the diets in a magazine or on a website I end up with headaches that last for days. You see, I have multiple food allergies and everything that is supposedly \"good\" for me, I'm allergic to.\u00a0\u00a0For instance, I'm allergic to 5 of the 7 grains, most fruits and vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0I 've asked my PCP for a referral to someone who can help me with diet issues before but she just brushed me off.\u00a0\u00a0I'm in an HMO, so maybe it's not a covered service.\u00a0\u00a0So does anyone know where I can find a diet I can actually follow without getting sicker?",
