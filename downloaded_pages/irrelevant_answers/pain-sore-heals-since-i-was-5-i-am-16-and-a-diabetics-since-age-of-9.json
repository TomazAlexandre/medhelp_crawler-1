            "answer": "Hello Alena,Welcome. Chronic Pain is defined by the type of pain you are experiencing. I'm sorry that at 16 you know the definition!\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like you have seen all the right physicians.My first questions is are your parents continuing to help you in the search for a diagnosis? Have you had an MRI?The most common cause of bilateral heel pain is Sever's Disease, otherwise known as Calcaneal Apophysitis. This is an inflammation of the growth plate in the heel of growing children. It typically appears in adolescents. I assume they have ruled that out with x-rays and labs. Is that correct?Plantar fasciitis is another painful condition of the heels. It's caused by straining the ligament that supports your arch - which fits your pain but doesn't begin at 5ish. I don't know if it's ever been seen in adolescents.As a child I had severe leg pain, so bad I would cry nights wi",

            "answer": "Sorry I hit the post comment by error.As I was saying I had severe leg pains beginning around 7 and until I was in my late teens. My sister (4 years younger) had the same when we reached 7-8. No physician could ever find a diagnosis. The physicians thought was it was due to growth. So these things do happen.What medications have been ordered to help with your pain? NSAIDs are often effective. I'm sure your physicians consider your age when prescribing.There are PMP (Pain Management Physicians) that perform procedures to treat pain. Talk to your family doctor or pediatrician regarding a referral. I know you're just 16 and I am not sting opiates - but today PMP do much more than opiate therapy.It's important you stress upon your parents (or trusted adult) as well as your physician(s) how much this pain is effecting your daily life. Come on - a girl at 16 should be able to shop all day - and half the night if she so desires. not only deserve to enjoy an active lifestyle - your diabetes demands it.I hope something I've said has been helpful. Don't give up. Keep seeking an answer and treatments. We're here if you have additional questions or comments. I wish you the best.Take Care,~Tuck",

            "answer": "Thanks. I have not had an MRI I can talk to my doctor and I can maybe see if I can get a PMP. I did have the x-ray to rule out Calcaneal Apophysitis. No doctor has suggested Plantar fasciitis though I have heard of it and I will mention it to my doctors.",

            "answer": "I'm hopeful your primary care physician will work with you to get to the source of your pain. An MRI may reveal nothing - but if all else has been negative I think it's worth a shot.If the root of your pain cannot be determined that at the least you deserve to be an active teenager. Injections (don't worry they use good local anesthetics) may help - if they can find a cause and reason to inject.Good luck and please let us know how you are doing.Peace,~Tuck",

    "question": "Since I was really young, maybe around lets say 5ish, I have always had sore heals. However since I was so young, I thought it was because walking made me tired. But, the problem never went away. I can not stand for more 2-3 mins, walking is a bit easier. The longer I stand the worse it get. I describe the pain as be bruised by hammers continuously hitting my heal. Even then the pain can get worse, it can get to the point where it feels like my bones have turned to glass and every step feels like they are shattering all the way up my spine. I am currently 16, female, height 5ft 6\", and my weight is 155lb, I also have somewhat flat feet not high arches. I am\u00a0\u00a0a type 1 diabetic, was diagnosed at age 9. I thought the pain maybe be weight or diabetes related but I have had this pain before I became a diabetic and when I was a lot lighter and more active.I have consulted my pediatrician, 2 different podiatrist, 2 different dermatologist, endocrinologist, and neurologist.I haven't gotten much response from any of them. I have had x-rays, been proscribed tropical creams, tried expense diabetic recommend comfort shoes, extra padded comfort socks. My diabetes is well controlled and blood work is fine. I feel my doctors do not understand the serious of my pain and how it is effecting my lifestyle and health. It to painful to enjoy going outside, effecting my activity and vitamin D intake. I can not go shopping, concert, parks, walks without needing to sit down after 5 mins or pain and without feeling embarrassed by it.I don't know what to do and no one around me seems to understand how difficult it is for me. I need to control my health I know, but it's hard when I cann't go and walk for 10 mins without wanting to cry. I have read pass/ similar discussions but I'm not sure that some of the answers applied to me.Any suggestions or help????",
