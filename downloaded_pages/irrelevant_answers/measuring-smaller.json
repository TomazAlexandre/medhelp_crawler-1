            "answer": "I did with my 1st. My uterus was measuring small I was 34 weeks but measuring 31/32. Everything was fine he was just fine in there had an ultrasound to check on him. Sometimes they get concerned if your measuring small that baby isnt getting what it needs from placenta to thrive so they arent growing. If that does end up being the case they may have to takr baby early.",

    "question": "So I went for just a regular ob check up, when he measured my stomach he asked when was my last sonogram and if and when I was having another one...I told him my next one is on the 27th and to count 4weeks back and that's when I had my las sonogram. While I was leaving I heard him telling a student doctor that I was measuring 2-3 cm smaller and that since I was having a sonogram soon that they would see the size better then...has anyone measured smaller, what was going on, and what did your doctor say?",
