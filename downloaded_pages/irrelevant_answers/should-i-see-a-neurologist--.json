            "answer": "Hi.I understand how you feel and how you badly want to get to the bottom of what has been affecting you. I do hope that you will recover from this soon.Your symptoms of shooting pain from the neck to the fingertips of the left extremity do suggest with high likelihood that what may be causing your condition is an impinged or compressed nerve, possibly at the cervical spine level. This, however, does not rule out other possible causes of your condition, as what your doctor has suggested, such as a thyroid disorder, some vitamin and mineral deficiencies, diabetes, or even stress and anxiety.It would be highly advisable for you to consult a neurologist as soon as possible so that the underlying cause of your condition can be ascertained. In the meantime, while waiting for an appointment, do continue with what you have started. I applaud you for having the initiative to engage in other activities, such as meditation, to cope with your condition. I would also advise heat therapy as this has been reported to provide some relief to nerve pain.Hope this helps you in any way.Good luck.",

    "question": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 29 year old male, relatively healthy who works in a rather stressful environment (substance abuse), recently became engaged and is being treated for anxiety/depression along with ADD.\u00a0\u00a0 I am currently taking Lexapro (10 mg/day), Klonopin (.5 mg twice a day for about two months), and Adderall (30 mg/day).\u00a0\u00a0I see a Psych. MD (it's free with my insurance) and he says that I'm not \"crazy\" but anxiety are my problem, to not \"worry\" so much, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Part of which I believe and part of which I think is something that could be more than \"Normal\" stress; he actually suggested potentially seeing a Nuerologist along with getting my thyroid checked out.Over the past couple of years, I have had this on/off bout with a radiating, shooting pain that extends from my neck (down my left arm) to my fingerstips.\u00a0\u00a0Medication (first Zoloft in 2005; then Klonopin in 2007) has helped but it has persisted for a period of two (2) months with little/no improvement; it's like the pain is driving me crazy (it's almost like a fluid of some sort is shooting down my left arm); it can go on from AM to PM most days.\u00a0\u00a0On weekends it isn't as bad; I am in the process of learning breathing techniques/meditation to aid in coping with it; don't get me wrong, I know I have a lot to be thankful for but does this sound nuerological?Any help/advice you could give me would be much appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0It's like this \"pain\" is causing the people around me a lot of \"pain\" because I can't seem to get to the root of it.Thanks much,John",
