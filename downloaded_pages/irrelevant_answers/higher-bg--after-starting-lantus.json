            "answer": "Insulin reduces glucose [blood sugar] levels not elevate. Keep in mind many things elevate glucose levels; improper diet, lack of exercise, excessive body weight, even stress.Test times:1. - Lantus - before dosing to see your beginning day level2. - Preprandial - right before you eat to get a baseline measurement3. - Postprandial - 2-3 hours following a meal. This will tell you how the foods you ate affected your glucose level.Also important to dose Lantus at the same time each day. Good luck",

            "answer": "Thank you, but I exercise 3 times a day (hard) East mostly green veggies small amounts of lean meat and rarely a slice of whole wheat bread (10 carbs per slice) Have lost 18 pounds in the last 2 months (need to lose more!) I had my numbers between 87-145 after breakfast up till bedtime...1st thing in the AM was quite another story usually in the 160s to 170s no matter what I did...at 2 am is was in the 80s, after 3 am in the 170s yeah, must have been dawn somewhere! My doctor put me on Lantus (one week ago) to bring down the AM numbers they are starting to come down somewhat so she keeps upping the units...however the problem I am seeing is that pre meals are now running in the 150s and post meals are running in the high 140s, that's with the low carb and exercise. So I am confused. What a difference a week makes!",

            "answer": "High morning glucose levels can be attributed to Dawn Phenomenon aka the Symogi Effect. Try a Google search for more info. DP can be caused by the natural release of hormones and also by eating a carb snack before bedtime. Please understand that carbs come in all forms [vegies too] not just bread flour. [see Simple vs Complex carbs]. One bedtime therapy is vinegar taken with cheese at bedtime. This is known to reduce glucose in food absorption. Others eat a protein snack like peanut butter.You don't mention when you take your insulin. If it's in the morning you may wish to discuss with your doctor bedtime basal injection but be aware of nocturnal hypoglycemia. Along these lines you should Google LADA [Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults] aka type 1.5. A couple of simple tests can rule out LADA - C-Peptide and GAD [Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase antibodies].BTW, postprandial levels areDiabetics - <141 mg/dl, optimum <121 mg/dl",

I will be sure to try vinegar and cheese and a couple of spoons of peanut butter sound good too.\u00a0\u00a0I'll be sure to Google for LADA too! Thank you again for all the great information!!",

            "answer": "Hi,your numbers could be getting worse simply because your diabetes is getting worse (ie. you might have adult onset type 1).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sounds like you're doing what you should in terms of diet and exercise.You may need to be using a short acting insulin to cover meals if you can't get the numbers down with your diet and the lantus only.I can recommend a book by Dr. Richard Bernstein (just google him and diabetes) which gives excellent information on managing diabetes.Best wishes",

            "answer": "Thank you, I will look him up. I guess I was just panicing when I watched ALL numbers going up and up within 1 day of starting Lantus. Must have just been the liver fighting with the insulin. My numbers are finally starting to come down now so I guess the Lantus is starting to win that battle.I am very grateful to both of you for your advice, support and kind words.Just when you think you've got this....it bites you in the behind just to keep you on your toes :O",

            "answer": "It takes time to adjust things.\u00a0\u00a0The main thing is that you are now on the right track.\u00a0\u00a0Actually, when adjusting insulin it is best to adjust by only 1 - 2 units per day and then observe for 2 - 3 days before making further adjustments.\u00a0\u00a0Slow and steady is the way to go.\"Using Insulin\" by John Walsh is also an excellent book.The best thing I learnt from these books, particularly from the Bernstein book, is that as diabetics it is possible and optimal and that we as diabetics have the right to have truely normal blood sugars (ideally A1C is in range of 4.2 - 4.5, but around 5 is still good).\u00a0\u00a0If we can achieve that we can avoid all complications.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, it takes discipline and hard work, but that sure beats the alternative of dying from diabetic complications in 15 or 20 years...My last A1C was 5.1 and I'm still working hard to try to get it below 5.\u00a0\u00a0I use low carb diet, insulin and exercise.You will become a pro at this in a while.\u00a0\u00a0Keep reading and being an educated patient! :)",
