            "answer": "Yes I've been speaking to god everyday I'm just soo confused about what's going on. I feel pain almost everywhere I haven't been able to eat because I get a headache and lightheaded it's the worst feeling. I can't wear anything tight because my muscles start to hurt. And everytime I look it up on the internet either diabetes pops up or fibromyalgia. But they told me I'm not diabetic could I have turned diabetic within a couple weeks. I've been eating healthier. Idk if my panic attacks rose up my blood sugar . Is that possible? But idk thanks for your comment",

    "question": "So yeah I know I post up a lot here and it's mostly because of my anxiety. Ever since those panic attacks I've had a few months ago I have not been the same. I don't feel like I have anxiety anymore I haven't had an attack in a while I'm just always constantly having muscle pain on my hands and feet or my hands fall asleep I get this rubber band feeling around my wrist and sometimes ankles. I get joint pain as well and I'm always light headed especially when I'm eating. Like uggghhh. It's been bothering and I'm not diabetic I had a physical a month ago. I don't understand I also get these chest pains at time and my hands fall asleep some nights when I'm sleeping and my jaw and bottom teeth always hurt. Including my lower back hurts. And these symtoms are 24:7 I don't know what to do like I'm taking some pills and I feel like they don't help at all. I also got checked for stds and I'm negative on everything.?whats wrong with me :( my body doesn't stop messing with me",
