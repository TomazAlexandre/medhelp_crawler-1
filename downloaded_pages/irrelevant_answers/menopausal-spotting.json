            "answer": "Hello,Causes of post menopausal bleeding could be ovarian cyst fibroids and endometriosis, diseases of pituitary gland, hormonal imbalance of estrogen and progesterone, thyroid hormone imbalance, malignancies\u00a0\u00a0and diabetes. Your\u00a0\u00a0doctor may consider tests like blood sugar levels, thyroid function test, prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSA), estrogen, and testosterone. Imaging studies, such as ultrasound, X-ray, and CT scan or MRI brain may also be recommended in certain individuals. Apart from that if the PAP smear has come out normal, then although it is unlikely to be any cervical malignancy but a colposcopy can be done before going in for D+C. then the sample from D+C can also be sent to the lab.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
