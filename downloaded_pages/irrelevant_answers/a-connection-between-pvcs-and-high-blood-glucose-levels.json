I don't know that there was any connection to my diet as my pvcs have a mind of their own.\u00a0\u00a0I am no longer on that diet as it didn't seem to agree with me.Beema",

            "answer": "Tom, I have normal sugars but PVCs anyhow, so no experience like yours.\u00a0\u00a0However, it takes energy to run the sodium-potassium pump that controls the voltages (which are involved in electrical transmission and contraction) inside and outside the heart cells and other cells of the body:http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072495855/student_view0/chapter2/animation__how_the_sodium_potassium_pump_works.htmlIt also takes energy to re-**** the myosin heads involved in muscular contraction (this is the 'sliding filament' model of muscle contraction, if you're into that:\u00a0\u00a0http://www.lionden.com/ap1out-muscle.htm).It takes energy to run the 'calcium pump' to transport calcium across the cell membrane during muscle contraction.Glucose is the essential source of energy for every cellular activity, and its entry into the cells of the body is mediated by insulin.\u00a0\u00a0In diabetics and pre-diabetics, the ability of sugar to enter the cell is compromised.\u00a0\u00a0It's reasonable to think that lowering your weight and normalizing your blood sugar might be helping your now-happier Islet cells to make enough insulin to get glucose into the cells where it's needed, when it's needed.I'm sure there are varying PVC triggers for each individual, but in a person with pre-diabetes or Type II diabetes, whose Islet cells might be overstressed or jeopardized, it cannot be a bad thing to optimize the fuel resources you have on board in your particular body.",

I absolutely believe that what I put into my mouth greatly affects the PVC situation. I have also noticed that GERD and PVCs go hand in hand. For me, grains (white flour, in particular) brings on acid reflux, which then gives the way to PVCs. I truly believe you can stop PVCs with a Paleo diet.Good luck!",

            "answer": "Hi Tom,Yes, I do. I was diagnosed with SVT early in life (40's). I also was diagnosed as pre-diabetic about 3 years ago. Like you, I lost the weight by going on a low carb. diet. Now that I am older, my SVT episodes seem to be correlated to periods where my HbA1c's are higher (5.9). They also seem to appear at roughly the same time; just before lunch.I am not sure my cardiologist gives much credence to my observations, but if there are scientific articles about it, I would be interested, because it would help me avoid these episodes, which are scary.Jackie",

    "question": "I was wondering if there is a connection between high blood glucose levels and PVCs?About two months ago, I started a diet that was devoid of carbohydrates.\u00a0\u00a0My physician had warned me for years about my rising blood sugar, but I paid him no heed.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, in late March he gave me an ultimatum to cut my blood glucose level or start diabetic medication.\u00a0\u00a0This caught my attention.\u00a0\u00a0So with a healthy, and fixed heart, I began strenuous exercising (for a guy that's 60), and eliminating carbohydrates; anything \"white\" was gone.\u00a0\u00a0Pasta, flour, sugar, starches, anything white was\u00a0\u00a0I also began blood glucose testing 4 times a day. Initially, my blood sugar was very high.\u00a0\u00a0Then it started fluctuating wildly, from a low of 78 to a high of 140.Now all during this period, and as well as before my ablation for SVT, I had been experiencing clusters of PVC's. They'd come and go.\u00a0\u00a0I'd have several weeks filled with clusters of skips, then they'd disappear for a week or so, only to return.\u00a0\u00a0This had been ongoing for the last 5 or 6 years.After about a month on the no-carb diet, I noticed thru testing, that my blood sugar had settled down.\u00a0\u00a0It was, and remains around 96 most of the time.\u00a0\u00a0Along with this, my PVC's were lessening.\u00a0\u00a0Then one day, they were gone.\u00a0\u00a0Initially I though this was goignt o be short-lived as they usually were.\u00a0\u00a0But a month has gone by, and I still have no PVC's.\u00a0\u00a0I am mouch more active than prior to my ablation, and I've lost about 15 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0But I can't see this as being the reason for the disappearing PVC's.Perhaps it's not the lower blood sugar levels that are the reason the PVC's went away, but lower insulin and hormonal levels.\u00a0\u00a0Has anybody else every experienced phenomonon?",
