    "question": "So we had an appoint this last thursday and the dr said everything looked fine. Some of you know that her dd is 5/1 by having 1 u/s done in the\u00a0\u00a0third 3rd trimester that was taken at the end of feb. Heres what doesn't make sense about it, the dr said that the baby hasn't gotten a whole lot bigger and that the u/s can be off by 3 weeks (which i already knew) she also said that she doesn't believe the baby will come before 5/1 and if it does then it won't be good. The dr. is also going to wait untl the child comes out on its own. I'm pretty convinced that the dr has her doubts about the u/s being right and that is way she rescheduled her for the 15th and then 2weeks after that which would be around 5/1. Should we be concerned about all this or not. Thanks.**Also thanks to all those who have read and answered my previous questions***",
