            "answer": "Hi there.When samples of blood, urine are collected, the insurer will test for the presence of antibodies or antigens to the HIV virus; cholesterol and related lipids; liver or kidney disorder; diabetes; antibodies to hepatitis; prostate specific antigen (PSA); and immune disorders. The urine sample might go through routine analysis, plus screening for certain medications, cocaine and other drugs.\u00a0\u00a0They can also detect cigarette patches.\u00a0\u00a0Ouch that stinks.\u00a0\u00a0No way to get away with being a smoker anymore.There are two ways your blood can be drawn: through a finger ***** or with a needle. A younger person might be asked for a finger-***** blood sample. If you're buying a large amount of life insurance, you might have to submit to a full blood profile.\u00a0\u00a0It depends on how much you are getting plus your age on what you have to do.\u00a0\u00a0Since you are young I don't see them doing a tread mill test or anything like that.\u00a0\u00a0Just be honest.Unless they ask that you bring your bottles with you, the parameidicals will probably just want to list what you take as a normal daily regimen.\u00a0\u00a0If your asking for a lot they could order an attending physician's staement from your doctor.Stay away from coffee /caffeine today and cholesterol.Good luck and congrats on the big girl pants.\u00a0\u00a0LOL\u00a0\u00a0Your friend.",

            "answer": "LOL!\u00a0\u00a0wish I knew to stay away from caffeine this a.m. as I drank an energy drink (combatting the oh so tired again lately -\u00a0\u00a0OK - I confess, I drank 2 since this a.m.).\u00a0\u00a0So, if I tell them I am taking xanax 25 1 time per day, they won't ask me why? If they do, I am sure to be denied having just resolving carotidynia, right??My big girl pants are a little toooooooo TIGHT right now! LOL",
