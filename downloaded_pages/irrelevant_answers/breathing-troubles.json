            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Are you prone for Asthma? Do you have a history of cardiac disease? Inadequate oxygenation can produce symptoms of breathlessness, as the body tries in an effort to compensate for the decreased oxygen supply. The breathlessness could be due to cardiac or lung disorders. Breathlessness on exertion could be due to the decreased lung function Again in cardiac disorders the heart is unable to pump the blood adequately, more so when subjected to stress like exercise. The calf pain and altered sensation in the feet could also be due to decreased oxygenation. So please consult your primary care physician at the earliest, who may ask for an EKG or a treadmill test to rule out a cardiac cause for your symptoms. He may even ask for blood tests and an X ray chest. Lung function tests could further help in evaluationHope this helped and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Understand your predicament. To begin with check your oxygen saturation, have a spirometry test done. Have your blood tested to rule out anemia, this can cause breathlessness. Another cause for breathlessness on lying down could be due to Obstructive sleep apnea.For your weight gain in spite of adequate exercise I can think of three possibilities. Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, where in due to hormonal irregularities the person has symptoms of irregular menstruation, weight gain, insulin resistance (diabetes) and excess androgenic activity causing facial hair. Again symptoms of weight gain could all be the side effects of certain medications. It could also be due to hypothyroidism, it also causes constipation, weight gain and loss of appetite, it could be in the subclinical form, when it fails to manifest. Discuss these options with your doctor.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
