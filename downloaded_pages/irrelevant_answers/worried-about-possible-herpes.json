            "answer": "Urinary tract infections and yeast infections are uncommon in men under age 40.\u00a0\u00a0Red bumps 'in the vaginal area' that come and go indeed sound like herpes is a possibility.\u00a0\u00a0Red bumps on the scrotum are not particularly suggestive of that diagnosis, but painful urination might be.\u00a0\u00a0Most important, the opinion of a health care provider who has examined someone generally is more reliable that of an online expert who only has a verbal description.\u00a0\u00a0Also, you don't give enough information:\u00a0\u00a0frequency of recurrent 'red bumps', whether on one or both sides of her vagina, other symptoms, more detail about frequency and timing of your urinary symptoms, STD risks either before or during your marriage, your and your wife's age, and so on.For now, I suggest you wait for your wife's test results, then if things remain uncertain, discuss things further with your wife and her doctor.\u00a0\u00a0You also should be professionally examined to determine the cause of your urinary symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0If the provider thinks herpes remains a possibility, you both could have blood tests to determine whether either or both of you are infected.Good luck--\u00a0\u00a0HHH, MD",

    "question": "Last week my wife got 4 red bumps in her vaginal area two of them went away and the other two are almost gone.\u00a0\u00a0She is prone to getting urinary tract infections and yeast infections.\u00a0\u00a0None of the bumps are blisters or open sores. They are just red bumps.\u00a0\u00a0I have gotten two red bumps half way up my scrotum and I have a slight burning sensation when I finish urinating.\u00a0\u00a0She went to the doctor today and they did a swab and the results wont be available for a week.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor said it could be a number of things but she also said it could be herpes.\u00a0\u00a0Based on the past articles that I have read in this forum and from the research I have conducted.\u00a0\u00a0It seems hard to believe that its herpes.\u00a0\u00a0I feel thats I have a urinary tract infection and possible a yeast infection thought I have no discharge and no blisters and no open sores.\u00a0\u00a0Could you please give me some advice on this so that my wife can stop panicking.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your help Doc",
