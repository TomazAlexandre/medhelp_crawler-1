            "answer": "I learned yesterday that if you have gd, there is more to it than just staying away from sugar. You have to learn to pair foods that release sugars quickly with foods that release it slowly to keep your levels more steady. I'm not getting tested for it, which is why my midwife wants to go over the information with me. I'm supposed to track my diet for a week and take it in at my next appointment and that is when she'll go more in depth with me.",

            "answer": "Nothing is wrong with the baby when you get gd. If your sugars are uncontrolled and high then it becomes problematic but taking care of yourself and diet n yes pairing foods and all that its fine.",

I do have to fast and nurse recommended avoiding sweets for 5 days prior to test as well so that's what I'll be doing. My mom had gestational diabetes when she was pregnant with my brothers (twins), and they were healthy. She had to give herself shots. After birth, back to normal.",
