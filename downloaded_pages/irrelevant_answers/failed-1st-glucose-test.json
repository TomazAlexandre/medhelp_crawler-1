            "answer": "Don't worry. The first test is just a pretest. At least here in Germany it means that there is just one glucose value of your blood taken 60 minutes after drinking a glucose solution.\u00a0\u00a0No pre defined starting conditions like time of the day the test is taken or that you have not eaten for a defined time prior to glucose intake,, no starting value at time \"zero\" etc.This one value could be too high for any number of reasons.the second test is more scientific with defined boundary conditions, and three measurements i.e a starting value,\u00a0\u00a0one after 60min to see how high the blood sugar climbs, and a third one after 120 min to see how well your body gets the sugar down again.before the results of this second test, try not to stress yourself at all!And, as Ayvas_mommy wrote, even if the second test comes up positive ss well, the vast majority can be dealt with with simple dietry measures.",
