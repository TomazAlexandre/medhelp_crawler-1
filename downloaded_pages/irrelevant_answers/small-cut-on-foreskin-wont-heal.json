            "answer": "Hello,On this cut, apply topical antibiotic cream like Neosporin and take oral antibiotics. Also avoid intercourse and masturbation for a few days when you take these antibiotics. Also get your blood sugar levels checked as diabetes is responsible for delayed wound healing.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "I have a small cut on my foreskin that wont heal properly. It has been about 2yrs now and nothing seems to work. I have tried Steroid creams and Thrush creams and abstained from sex and masterbation for several weeks, but this cut wont go away. It seems to be healing then if we have sex the cut reopens. It is not particularly painful just more uncomfortable, but it is making me not want to have sex with my girlfriend. I have no STD's (been\u00a0\u00a0checked several times), nor does my girlfriend who is pregnant so i know everything is in working order so to speak...except from this cut. I am 27 and otherwise fit and healthy, please can someone help?",
