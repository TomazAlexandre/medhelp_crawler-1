    "question": "I was diagnosed with hep c 4 years ago. I don't remember the genotype but I remember the dr. said it was the worst type, the hardest to get under control. I had a biopsy done shortly thereafter and it showed that I was a 1 on a scale from 0-4. I haven't been under medical care since then and had an addiction problem until last year. After I got clean I began having severe problems with hypoglycemia. My questions are: What is the best, cheapest and most available treatments for hep c, and from your experience how bad off are you if the virus is affecting your blood sugar?",
