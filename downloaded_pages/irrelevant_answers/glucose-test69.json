It's a Challenge and you get discouraged sometimes especially because it gets worse as you progress in pregnancy. But I had my son at 38 weeks 4 days last Wednesday and he is perfect.. 6lbs 2oz and he came on his own. My delivery was super quick.. Pushed him out in 5 mins. His bloodsugar were perfect and he's in perfect health. My bloodsugars are going back to normal too. I said all that to say it'll be ok mama.

            "answer": "I was pretty sad when I was diagnosed with GD. they'll monitor your sugar and see how your sugars get. You have to prick yourself 4 times a day. It'll be tough, and extra tough the more you have to keep doing it. But it's possible to stay off diabetic meds and just control it with diet and exercise. I still have horrible days, Esp being a nurse working night shift I literally have to eat like every 1-2 hours. You do what you have to to keep baby healthy until the end. Plus It's a good kick in the butt for you when the baby is out. You don't realize how many carbs and bad stuff you put into your body until you have to prick yourself 4 times a day. It's all about portion controlling too.",

You need to eat more frequently to maintain stable levels 3 meals and 3 snacks a day. There are a lot of things you can still have in moderation... it gets easier the longer you are on the diet. :)",

I freaked when I first found out...now it's no biggie. I treat myself to a sweet here and there but watch my snacking and actually try to go by the portions suggested... which I may add is only like 6 pita chips....lol :-) I already can tell a difference if I eat too much...makes me feel terrible. Good luck! :-)",
