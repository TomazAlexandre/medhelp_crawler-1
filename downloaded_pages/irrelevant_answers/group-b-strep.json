            "answer": "I have been pre-diabetic for almost 1.5 years now. I have had tingling sensation all over the body, Numbness in feet and slight neurotic pain in the legs below knees. And I have been having these bumps on my penis and pubic region for the same amount of time. I have been negative for STDs. And recenly the tingling, itching is mostly in the groin area. My vision seems to be blurred since yesterday. My fasting sugars right now range between 104 -118. Please let me know why metamorphin is needed .. would it delay onset of full diabetes. And is there a way to prevent full diabetes in this pre-diabetic state. Thanks.",
