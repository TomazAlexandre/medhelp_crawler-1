    "question": "Hey, I'm new to this site and hope that I'm posting my question in the right section. I'm 26 and have had diabetes for a little over a year now. I was lucky enough to have gotten a Minimed Paradigm 722 pump for free only after I got pregnant and got on Medicaid. It was a huge help. When i got pregnant with my son i ended up in the hospital with sugar readings over 600 and had DKA. Only then was it that i found out i was pregnant and in dire need to lower my uncontrolled sugar. So I got the pump for free, THANK GOD, lowered my sugars to more reasonable numbers, and have been lucky enough to receive all supplies and insulin at no charge. Now that my son was born I will no longer have medicaid as of the end of this month, December. So finally getting to my question, can anyone direct me to where I can get supplies at a low cost? I have no insurance and desperatley need supplies. It would be greatly appreciated if anyone could please point me in the right direction!",
