Friedman, MD, PhD and Winnie Yu Scherer:\"Although the majority of people with Hashimoto's will not develop any other disorders, it's important to know what some of these autoimmune conditions are in case you do start to experience symptoms.

    "question": "Ever since I got mono about 10 years ago I've been tired a lot and still getting sick easily. I sleep probably about 10-12 hours a night but I usually still feel tired. I do wake up a lot when I'm sleeping though. I have been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and depression but these symptoms of tiredness have never really gone away even when I'm happier and not having major digestive symptoms. It does seem to get worse when I'm stressed though.I feel lightheaded a lot and I have low blood pressure and low pulse rate, but I guess not to the extent that my doctor thinks they are a problem. I do just barely meet the qualifications for hypotension and bradycardia (low pulse). I sometimes feel better when I eat something salty but then I wonder if that's in just in my head.I have always had irregular periods and I have somewhat excessive facial hair growth that has gotten worse in the past few years.More recently I've noticed that I almost always have a feeling of pressure in my head. It feels better when I rub it or press on it but usually just temporarily better.I've talked with doctors about this in the past and they have basically no idea but it has been a few years so I can't say for sure what tests they have done. I am already being treated for my ulcerative colitis and my depression.",
