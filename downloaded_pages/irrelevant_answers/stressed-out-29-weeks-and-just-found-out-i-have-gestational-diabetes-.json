            "answer": "I was diagnosed with GD at my first prenatal visit, at 11 weeks and I remember crying my eyes out because I was so worried. I started googling and just freak out about what I read. I'm currently 31 weeks, I check 4 times a day, every day and so far I've kept it under control. I have only gained 13 pounds mainly because I watch what I eat. Or try not to over eat. Try to balance the healthy and the not so healthy cravings we get sometimes. The doctors assure me every visit that as long as I keep my sugar levels at or below were they are supposed to be, everything will be fine. Just listen to them, monitor, and eat as healthy as you can and you should be good!",

I Test 4 times a day and my levels were normally consistent but then I would occasionally gets spikes just from the horomones. Stick to a diet, and if there are inconsistencies it's okay, just call your doctor and he told me that hormones can make things crazy sometimes but it happens and as long as you keep testing and keeping to a diet they will let you know if you need to change anything specifically:) make sure you eat snacks, especially before bed (15 - 25 carbs) because that is what will keep your numbers low when you wake in the morning. When you have higher numbers than 95 consistently that is what will make your baby gain weight. They will measure your baby via ultrasound and tell you the weight and see if it is a concern or not.",

He said its not my fault. Your body will automatically give your baby what it needs first leaving you with low insulin levels.. I didn't have to take any medication. I was told if have a 9-10lb baby.. had her at 39 weeks she was 5lbs. She looked so tiny.. With my second I didn't get gd, and this time around I got checked at 20wks and will do it again in about 2 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Try not to worry drink lots of water & eat healthy",
