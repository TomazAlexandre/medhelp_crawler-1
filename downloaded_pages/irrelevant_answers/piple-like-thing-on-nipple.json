            "answer": "It seems to me that usually more harmless things, like vomiting or a tooth ache, or your pimple, are usually much more painful than more serious diseases like diabetes or cancer, at least in the beginning.From what you describe, I am not the least bit worried that you have cancer, no matter how uncomfortable. I am also sure that touching and pushing on the area does not help but rather makes it worse.Try taking a bath with Epson salts\u00a0\u00a0which you can buy in pretty much every drugstore or even grocery store. It may also help to place a larger bandaid on your nipple to protect the area from rubbing against your bra. Maybe also some oil like vit E , (if you have them at home in the form of vitamins you can open and use what is in the capsule)Good luck, Kat",

    "question": "Last night I noticed this little hard bump on my nipple, right on the edge of the little part that sticks out. It is a little sore, I thought it may be just a pimple, I used a little pressure to try to pop it, but it just made it more uncomfortable. This morning it is a little lighter in colour, again making me think pimple, but again when I tried to squeeze it, nothing came out and it just hurt. It is not bad pain, but I can feel it rubbing against my bra, s it is noticeable. Any idea what this may be? Also just to point out I have no kids so it is not from breast feeding.Thanks in advance!",
