I believe they are one in the same is that correct?Also my diagnosis was made when a neurologist ran an EEG that showed my brain having one seizure after another so small I dont know I am having them. If they are the same are you medicated to control the seizures? Do you have seizures?

I recently stopped drinking after I got this horrible pain in both my legs. My legs would just give out on me and I would fall. Its so bad im on a walker and cannot drive.. Its the worst pain I have ever felt!!!! Its hard to move around so I cant do much... Im also losing definition in my legs.. Its like when you see someone who is deathly skinny and there skin sinks in...They put me on lyrica... its ok but it doesn't help that much. I still feel pain 24/7. I have been on a ventilator, in jail, car wrecks and kicked out of many places. Don't do what I did, alcohol became my only device, nothing else mattered, not even my wife,,,now exwife because of alcohol, or my family. Alcohol makes you hurt the ones you love most!!!!!! Don't be like me,,, no job living off my parents, IF I CAN QUIT, TRUST ME, YOU CAN TOO!!!!!!!!!!!",
