            "answer": "Hi,It is my understanding that 95% of people with Hashimoto's disease have thyroid antibodies greater than the upper level of the reference range.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't look like you do but you could be one of the other 5%.What was the pathology of your thyroid?\u00a0\u00a0Again, it is my understanding that there can be coexisting thyroid cancer with Hashi's (some say Hashi's increases risk of developing thyroid cancer).\u00a0\u00a0If you did have Hashi's then the thyroid would have shown inflammatory changes consistent with Hashi's as well as the cancer.One of the reasons you might want to know if you had Hashi's is because there can an association with other autoimmune diseases --for example, pernicious anemia, type I diabetes and celiac disease.\u00a0\u00a0I have Hashi's and also have vitiligo (white skin patches) and was just tested for celiac disease.Just ask your doctor what the pathology showed and you should know.Good luck",
