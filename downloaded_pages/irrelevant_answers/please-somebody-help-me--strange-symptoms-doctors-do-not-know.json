            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Diabetes, thyroid disorders, low testosterone, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn\u2019s and systemic fungal infection should be ruled out by careful testing. Localized patches of hair loss on body can be due to fungal infection (tinea versicolor or tinea pedis) or any other fungal infection or it can also be due to seborrhagic dermatitis.Iron deficiency is the commonest cause of hair loss. Iron deficiency can be due to poor intake or poor absorption or due to hidden loss from bleeding as is seen in UTI and gut problems like IBS. The cause of anemia has to be found out by various blood tests. Iron replacement along with diet rich in iron and hemoglobin should be given. Please consult a hematologist if iron deficiency is detected. Hair loss can also be due to dandruff, dermatitis, shampoos, oils, soaps, dust and dirt etc. Thyroid disorders and diabetes too could be a cause. Insomnia, stress and anxiety along with poor diet and excess of caffeine too can be the cause.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, increased bilirubin can cause hair loss. This happens mainly in hereditary hemochromatosis which is a genetic condition in which excess iron is absorbed from the gut and stored in various parts of the body. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Take care!",
