            "answer": "I'm sorry that you're dealing with this. I'm sure it's very scary and frustrating too. But don't worry! The last thing you want to do is stress yourself out. Plentyyyy of women with diabetes and gestational diabetes have babies! Why your OB told you your baby would die is beyond me. I'd honestly probably switch doctors. Anyone's baby could have something happen! Just because you have GD does not mean your baby will die. Yes, it is important to keep your sugar low and have a well balanced diet. And they'll probably induce you a couple weeks early. The biggest problems moms usually have with GD is just having a large baby! Please don't worry too much. Watch your diet, keep an eye on your sugar and you and baby will be just fine.",

I got very emotional and started hyperventilating in her office. I felt so scared and just down right defeated. I am going to try my very best to not worry, but with anxiety it is definitely a challenge. I appreciate all the advice. Means so much!",

I go to two different specialist for my diabetes and my sugars run a little high most of the time and death has never been mentioned either pregnancy. Death is an extreme side effect. Just manage your sugars try and keep them low. A high reading here and there wont harm anyone.",

            "answer": "You'll be fine just start a strict diet. No sugar, sweets, candy, soda, no juice. I have gestational diabetes so there's a lot more sugars than you think. You have yo limit carbs which turns into sugars into your body rice, beans, cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, tortillas, bread, milk, bananas. I'm not saying you can't eat these just very very small amounts until your sugars are under control. Your doctor should have you meet with a dietician for this. You'll be fine but you have to start a very low carb no sugar diet.",

But I just can't believe that she left it at that and didn't talk more with her about how rare that is and how to manage it. That everything will be okay with these things she can do to help. A doctor needs to be informative, but also helpful and supportive.",

    "question": "I found out I had gestational diabetes. I am 30 weeks pregnant and my doctor said I failed really bad! She said I failed all four tests. I am scared. She said she thinks I might have diabetes without the pregnancy. Not only does that scare me. She also said that my baby boy could die if I don't keep my sugars at a normal level. I am so frightened to lose my baby. I have lost the baby before this due to progesterone levels being too low. I was only 7 weeks when I lost that baby. But now, I am 30 weeks and so in love with this little life growing inside of me. I guess what I am posting here for, is for some advice and/or help with coping with what my OBGYN told me.Could my son really die and be amended do still born? Please help me understand this!",
