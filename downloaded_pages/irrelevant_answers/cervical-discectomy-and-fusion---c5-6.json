            "answer": "Hi.It is possible that the neuropathy in your lower limbs has its origins in the cervical disc protrusion. As the disc protrudes more and presses the cord more, the lower limbs are also involved. At the same time, I would like you to screen for any simultaneous lumbar disc problems. If you have a job / work which involves sitting for long hours, then it becomes important to screen the lumbar area too.You can expect a double relief after the surgery.Just to add, do you have diabetes ruled out ?Regards",

            "answer": "Thanks for your reply.\u00a0\u00a0I'm hoping against hope that the cervical fusion will help my lower extremity problem too, because it's very uncomfortable.\u00a0\u00a0I was trying to get a solution for the peripheral neuropathy when the neck and arm problem because unbearable and I got involved in dealing with that.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, I sit long hours typing depositions for court reporters, and press on a foot pedal as I type for the audio.Diabetes has been ruled out over and over, because I also suffer from vision problems.\u00a0\u00a0Thank God, I have no diabetes, but my mother was a diabetic before she died.\u00a0\u00a0Lumbar problems have also been ruled out as well.\u00a0\u00a0I certainly don't need that.\u00a0\u00a0Enough is enough.\u00a0\u00a0LOL",

            "answer": "I also have neuropathy in both feet with loss of body mass from lower calf down.\u00a0\u00a0Starting to get pain in legs.\u00a0\u00a01st neurologist only did a pin wheel test and said I had idiopathic neuropathy and gave me Nortriptolyin 25mG which helped pain for a while then when pain increased they upped to 50mG.\u00a0\u00a0At this stage found chiropractor that did X ray & ordered MRI immediately finding herniated disks in L4/L5. 4 weeks of VAX-D decompression lowered pain from level 8 to level 1-2.\u00a0\u00a0But now getting level 2 leg pains.\u00a0\u00a0New Neurologist hasn't heard of herniated disk causing foot only pain & wants to run EMG nerve connection test and see if epidural will help.\u00a0\u00a0Only then will he consider neuropathy being related to herniated disk.\u00a0\u00a0Crazy that lower cost/trained chiropractor found problem in 2 days when high paid docs couldn't find or are arguing with results.\u00a0\u00a0Interesting he could explain why VAX-D significantly decreased pain if herniated disk not related to foot problem.\u00a0\u00a0After reading how nerve damage can be permanent, I'm going to start searching for doctor that will operate.\u00a0\u00a0Research suggest best is non-traumatic disectomy - orthoscopic with not muscle or bone damage.\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone point me to hard research I can take to neurosurgeons?\u00a0\u00a0-thx!",

    "question": "I'm scheduled for a Cervical Discectomy and Fusion of C5-6 in about a week.\u00a0\u00a0I've been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy in my legs and feet and I'm wondering if there's an even slight chance that the cervical disk problem might be causing the neuropathy and that I will get relief by having this surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not having the surgery for that reason, but because I'm having an ever-increasing problem with my right arm and hand because of the disk herniation.\u00a0\u00a0I'm just hoping to get a \"double bang for my buck\" by getting some relief of the neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you for your answer.",
