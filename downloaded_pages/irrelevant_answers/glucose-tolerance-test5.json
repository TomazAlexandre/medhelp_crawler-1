I think my numbers were effected with the amount of time it took to drink it too (not positive,\u00a0\u00a0but that's what I blame). Good luck and relax!",

            "answer": "You must fast the night before. Meaning no eating anything after midnight. They usually do it for 1 hour you'll drink a very sweet orange drink. Then they'll draw blood to see your sugar. If its a bit high anything over 110 I believe you must go back to do a 3 hour glucose. If it is found that your sugar remains high. You have Gestational Diabetes which only occurs during pregnancy, but could be dangerous to your baby. So your doctor will order you on a strict diet. Good Luck!!!",

So you might get sick but the best way to get that stuff out of ya is to drink lots of water eat a little something and go to bed. My results always came back all good but as ya get older your body does that aging thing and the body tends to the dumps. Just to put it nicely.\u00a0\u00a0Regardless, it is a test that is more for the well being of your little one there than anything.\u00a0\u00a0Just don't drink anything that has sugar in it before you that the test or you won't be happy with your results.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to yas.",

I failed that one by 2 points. Now i needed to take a second round of stupid tests which i failed the 1 hour by 15 points this time, so now the three hour awaits me yeh! I do have a family history of diabetes on both sides so i guess it's better for me to be watched so closely, but it doesn't take away the fact that it's very annoying to sit through all these tests.",
