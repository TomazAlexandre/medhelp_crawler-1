    "question": "Hello,Hope someone can help me with my question. I've been experiencing pulsatile tinnitus in my right ear (corresponding with pulse) for several months now. No other symptoms until a couple of weeks ago, when an acute vertigo episode awoke me from my sleep in the middle of the night. I was sweating and very nauseous, but did not get sick to my stomach. Splashed some cold water on my face and went back to bed. A milder case of dizziness woke me later that night, but it wasn't as bad. The next day, I felt quite tired, and took it easy for the day.Since then, I have been somewhat dizzy/unsteady each day and have mild \"tension\" type headaches as well.The right side of my face subtly twitches here and there as well.My history: I'm 48 and am over my ideal weight by 40 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0I had Bell's Palsy on the other side of my face 2 1/2 years ago. At the time, had an MRI and a battery of tests incl. blood work, etc. - everything was fine. On follow up a year or so ago, another MRI and tests (including carotid doppler) , blood work, etc. were completed and everything again was fine. My vision Rx seems to have changed somewhat rapidly over the last three years (could be age?), but my recent visit with the ophthalmologist showed everything to be okay. Slightly elevated intraocular pressure, but was told it could be due to thicker cornea, (I do not have diabetes).I visited an ENT yesterday thinking that was the logical first step,based on what I've read here and there. All of the test results mentioned above were sent over. Until my Bells episode, I wasn't the type to run to a doctor very frequently, and had taken a rather 'holistic' approach to health, so it's not that I think every test in the world needs to be done, but I'm just afraid this ENT wasn't very thorough. He did two tests - a hearing test (hearing is fine) and the maneuver/test that detects BPPV - which I seem to heave. But he didn't have an idea about why I might have pulsatile tinnitus; thought it was a separate issue from the vertigo/dizziness/headaches then referred me to a neurologist.My question is, should I see another ENT first or should go straight to a neurologist? The dizziness scares me. My brother had a brain anyeurism several years ago.",
