            "answer": "Firstly, diabetes does not always require medication.\u00a0\u00a0Smoking, diet, and exercise can affect one's glucose levels.\u00a0\u00a0Type 2 diabetes can sometimes be controlled by making changes without needing medications (I know, I've been working on it for the last several months since being diagnosed).The first thing you should be doing is getting your Hgb A1C checked (a simple non-fasting blood test) to see what it shows has been going on with your glucose over the past few months.\u00a0\u00a0You will also want to have your glucose levels monitored during tx.\u00a0\u00a0I requested that mine be watched since diabetes is a possible sx and I do have a family pre-dispostion to it and unfortunately it was not,\u00a0\u00a0 I learned of my diabetes a few months post tx when I began having symptoms.Was the glucose reading you've mention from a fasting or non-fasting measurement?Since our livers are responsible for insulin production, and a the primary filter also can affect BP, you want to be more cautious of doing tx with abnormal readings already present.\u00a0\u00a0Do yourself a favor and find a doctor for your glucose and BP who knows more about HCV than simply how to spell it.",

            "answer": "You're right, Grand Oak, diabetes can be handled minus medication, especially if you're overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I was thinking toby was like me, a non-obese diabetic and kind of health-foody.\u00a0\u00a0I'd have to go on the Atkins diet (no carbs) to get my blood sugar in control, and I don't want to.\u00a0\u00a0But if you have some pounds to shed, results are almost inevitable.\u00a0\u00a0It all depends on where you're starting from, but I've read that just losing weight - if you need to - is the very best thing you can do for diabetes.I second Oak's recommendation for an A1c. Your primary physician can order that before you visit a specialist.",
