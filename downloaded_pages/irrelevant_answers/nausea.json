In the meantime I'll follow your advice about the healthy snack between meals.",

            "answer": "It depends on what type of tests you had done with regard to screening for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If you did have a blood test to check your HBA1C that shows the average sugar levels in your blood over a period of 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0 Every 9-12 weeks the red corpuscles are renewed, and the sugar sticks to the red corpuscles, this is how the HBA1C works out the average.A blood sugar monitor that uses a pin prick finger test will only show the sugar levels in your system at the time the test is being done.Another good way to check for glucose problems is by having a glucose test.\u00a0\u00a0This will show whether you are glucose intolerant.\u00a0\u00a0This means that you are not a diabetic but that there is a problem.When you mentioned that you experience problems \"prior\" to a meal, this means before you eat.But then you say you experience problems after you have eaten.\u00a0\u00a0In this case, it is highly likely to be gastric related.It may be that something in the smoothie is not agreeable to your digestive tract.\u00a0\u00a0Although lemon juice is acidic, it actually changes composition once in the body, where along the body it changes is composition I do not know.So it may well be that the lemon juice and the vinegar does not suit your stomach.Eating the small meals frequently, with healthy snacks in between will also help problems with acid reflux.\u00a0\u00a0Keep off junk foods (sounds like you do anyway), fried and highly spiced foods.\u00a0\u00a0Also cut out or cut down on processed foods, white bread, cakes, biscuits.\u00a0\u00a0Eat more fresh fruit and veg.\u00a0\u00a0By what you wrote with regard your smoothie, sounds like you have a healthy eating plan.Make sure that you drink fluids, especially water so as not to get dehydrated.Did the doctor prescribe any stomach medication for you to try?\u00a0\u00a0If not, try the eating plan first and if that does not settle things down, ask your doctor for a prescription or purchase some from the pharmacy.\u00a0\u00a0Your pharmacist will be able to help you with that, if you are unsure which remedy to purchase.",

            "answer": "This problem has nothing whatsoever to do with diabetes or sugar levels. The symptoms are textbook indications of a weak muscle at the gastroesophageal junction.\u00a0\u00a0The esophagus passes through a hole in the diaphragm called the diaphragmatic hiatus before entering the stomoach. The diaphragm separates the chest from the abdominal cavityt the gastroesophageal junction. This condition is often associated with GERDS.See a gastroenterologist for a consult.",

            "answer": "Low acid levels are much more prevelent with GERD symptoms than high levels.The symptoms are almost identical, however in the vast majority of casesPPIs or anti-acid meds are prescribed w/out testing.I suggest the baking soda burp test or a Betaine HLC challenge to self-testfirst before resorting to anti-acids, which could cause your health to deteriorate even further if your gastric acid levels are low!Just look it up online.In Endometriosis, there's often an underlying Estrogen(over Progesterone) dominance.Relatively simple to correct if this is the case, should it still be unresolved.Food senstitivity/intolerance needs to be ruled out as well.Elimination diet is the simplest way, but when testing gluten you have to beoff it for months, as its effects may linger around for a very long time, before totally eliminated from the body.Cheers.Niko",

            "answer": "On looking at my blood test results, Jemma, they say my\u00a0\u00a0\"R Gluc Serum\" levels were 5.7 April 14; 4.4 May & July 14; 3.8 Aug 14 and 4.1 Sept 14. Presumably this was what my Doctor based his advice on that I didn't have diabetes.I think I may have confused you with when the nausea occurs.\u00a0\u00a0I have my breakfast without problems and then about 4 hours later, prior to lunch I start getting the nausea, sometimes even dry-retching.\u00a0\u00a0This dissipates if I eat something - even just a small amount.I haven't changed the basic ingredients in my smoothies for ages and have been having the lemon juice in the hot water for a long time too.\u00a0\u00a0I only added the vinegar fairly recently, but quite a while prior to experiencing the nausea.\u00a0\u00a0I have stopped the vinegar in the last few days, but it hasn't really made a difference yet, so will try stopping the lemon juice too.My diet is primarily very good - no processed or junk foods.\u00a0\u00a0I rarely have gluten and keep away from sweets stuff apart from about four pieces of fruit a day.My Doctor didn't prescribe anything, but only suggested I try leaving off the apple cider vinegar.\u00a0\u00a0I'm reluctant to take any drugs and will try to remember to eat something in between those two meals.\u00a0\u00a0Although it does puzzle me why I don't ever have a problem between lunch and dinner, which seems a little strange - I don't have snacks between those meals.I might add also that I do have another problem at present and I don't know whether this might have anything to do with the nausea.\u00a0\u00a0I have a 30 percent leakage in my mitral heart valve and am due to have it either repaired or replaced shortly.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime I have been taking Micardis Plus, but this is the only medication I take apart from several vitamin and mineral supplements which I have also been having for a long time under the supervision of a naturopath.I appreciate all your comments Jemma.",

            "answer": "By your\u00a0\u00a0\"R Gluc Serum\" levels, you do not have diabetes.Although your lowest blood (at 3.8) wasn't at the level that would be classed as having hypoglaecemia, you certainly seem to experience symptoms of low sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0I have copied and pasted the link below for you to help you understand more about hypoglaecemia in people who do not have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I experienced similar symptoms for a very long time, before finally a glucose test showed up that I was prediabetic.http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/diseases/facts/bloodsugarlow.htmAs you do not experience a problem between lunch a dinner, I suggest you look at exactly what you are eating and drinking and the portion size at lunch time that is different to breakfast.The symptoms may be gastric related - that can settle with eating something (but not always, depending what the gastric problem is).To help to avoid getting those horrible symptoms before lunch, I suggest you have a healthy snack like an apple or some protein food like nuts.\u00a0\u00a0That may just be enough to see you to lunch without experiencing those nausea symptoms.I have found that eating small amounts more frequently does help with gastric problems like acid reflux.Mitral valve leakage sometimes produces no symptoms, but your doctor may hear a heart murmur.\u00a0\u00a0As you need to have this fixed soon, it clearly is quite bad.\u00a0\u00a0You are already no doubt aware of the types of symptoms that can be felt from a leaky valve, which include lightheadedness, rapid heartbeat, heart fluttering or palpitations, fatigue.Severe heart valve leak may impair the forward flow of blood that can cause symptoms of congestive heart failure, which includes shortness of breath, especially with exertion or when lying flat, leg swelling or fluid retention elsewhere in the body.Hope all goes well for you.Best wishes.",

It also lists the other medical conditions that can cause low sugar levels (hypoglycaemia).http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/166815.phpYour lunch does seem to contain more protein (cottage cheese, eggs, nuts or other protein) than your breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0Protein, as you will no doubt know, is a slow release energy food.\u00a0\u00a0The quantity will matter as well as what you eat.There is no harm in eating a healthy snack in between your main lunch to see if that helps.\u00a0\u00a0Keep a written record of what you eat and drink and how many hours you go without food before starting to feel nauseas.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is likely to help you more and help your doctor to find what is causing you to feel that way.Don't forget too, that physical activity will use up more energy.There are lots of other causes for experiencing nausea.Let us know how you get on.Glad to know that the foot problem is now fine and that you will soon get your hear issue repaired.Wishing you well and a speedy recovery.",
