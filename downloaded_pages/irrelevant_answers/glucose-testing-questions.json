            "answer": "The drink spikes your sugar very high. The first drink is like chugging two 12 ounce sodas back to back. The test is to see how effectively your body metabolizes sugar while pregnant, some women don't make enough insulin while pregnant. Its not really indicative that you will be diabetic outside of pregnancy. It usually goes away after birth.",

    "question": "So, I went in Thursday and did my lovely glucose drink. The nurse I had told me anything coming back over 110 would need the three hour test. Dreadful.Anyways, diabetes does run in my family. They called this morning and set me up for the three hour test.I've checked my blood sugar at home and it's been running pretty low. 80s.Would the drink spike it up super high, or does it actually show the onset of diabetes? I have my ob appointment on next Monday. I just get questions stuck in my head.Also, 28 weeks tomorrow if that helps anything!",
