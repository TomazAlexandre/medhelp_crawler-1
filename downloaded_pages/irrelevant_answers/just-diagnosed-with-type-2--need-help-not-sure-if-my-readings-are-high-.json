            "answer": "Thanks for responding, and no need to apologize. Consider it human error, something we all do at times. Your glucose levels are definitely very high and close to dangerous. Please see a doctor and get medication to help lower and control your levels. If you Google search the words diabetes nutrition you will find many helpful links on nutrition (good and bad foods) - don't eat bad carbs, sugary food or liquids containing sugar. Try to eat in smaller portions spread out during the day to help ease the glucose entering your body. Stop smoking, lose weight, and perform moderate exercise will all help to reduce your levels.Good luck.",
