Going in Thursday to talk with GD doctor and find out my options. I want natural if I can. Also heard that if you start contractions or water break that if you hold off a short while till going yo hospital less chance of c sec unless baby is not turned.",

    "question": "I really don't want to be induced, but one dr said I should be and set a date for 5 says before my due date, and another dr said because I am on such a small dose of meds that I can refuse it but not to really go past my due date without the induction anyway!I am curious if there are any others that were/are on literally the tiniest bit of meds/on meds at all that have either refused the induction or have opted for the induction...I'm just trying to make a decision and as of right now I hate the idea of being induced but at the same time I am soooooooooo done with being pregnant!Btw I'm 37 weeks 2 days and scheduled for the induction in 2 weeks. Thanks!!!!",
