            "answer": "Hello,Black outs on laughing hard is due to hypoxia of the brain i.e when the brain does not get proper supply of oxygen.It may be due to cardiovascular causes, neurological causes or vasovagal attacks.Patients with cerebrovascular disease have partial or complete blockages in the arteries that supply the brain with blood.\u00a0\u00a0These blockages can cause a temporary loss of blood flow (called transient ischemic attack, or TIA for short), or permanent loss of blood flow (called stroke; also called cerebrovascular accident).This can lead to impaired blood flow through these arteries and so dizziness particularly on exaertional activity like laughing.Moreover, drugs like antihypertensivs, nitroglycerin and diuretics can lead to dizziness as their side effects.Other conditions are diabetes and vertebrobasilar insufficiency.I advise you to consult a cardiologist and neurologist and discuss these possibilities with them.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted in case of any additional queries and how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Whoa, Nelly.The most common cause is a sensitive vagus nerve, which is not all that serious. It if often genetic. The blacking out is due to a vasovagal episode.
