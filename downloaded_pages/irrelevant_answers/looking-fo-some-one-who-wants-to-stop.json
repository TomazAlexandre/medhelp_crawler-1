            "answer": "Hi!\u00a0\u00a0We can help you online here, but we don't usually meet in person.\u00a0\u00a0If you're wanting to quit cold turkey, have you thought about speaking to a doctor first?\u00a0\u00a0If you have any health issues, it would be unsafe to stop that much daily opiate without consulting a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0You're on a strong narcotic, so when you stop your BP is going to go up quite a bit.\u00a0\u00a0Also, if you have diabetes or stomach issues, it's not advisable to stop cold turkey. Same with any heart/lung problems.\u00a0\u00a0WD is hard on the body.\u00a0\u00a0You'll go without sleep for a while too!\u00a0\u00a0It's just a good idea to speak to a doctor unless you're 100% healthy.\u00a0\u00a0You're on a pretty decent dose, so I DEFINITELY recommend you speak to someone first.Do you have a family doctor?\u00a0\u00a0Or access to an urgent care?\u00a0\u00a0There are things you can buy OTC to help too.\u00a0\u00a0Look at the health pages on the bottom right or top right of this page at the Thomas Recipe.\u00a0\u00a0It's got good info.\u00a0\u00a0You can also read the Amino Acid Protocol.\u00a0\u00a0Also good info when quitting opiates.If you want to permanently quit using, you'll need to go to NA or therapy for aftercare.\u00a0\u00a0WDs will be for nothing if you don't get yourself some support!Best of luck to you!! :)",
