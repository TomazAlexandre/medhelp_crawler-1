            "answer": "Just also wanted to add that your doctor is ordering outdate tests. You should be having the following thyroid tests: TSH, Free T4 and Free T3. The Free's are the actual active thyroid hormone in the body. Totals are only used to see the ratio's of bound and active hormone....not where your true active levels are at. Also, the new TSH normal values are .30-3.0. Your lab is still using old range values. You definately need to look further into your thyroid function.",

            "answer": "Thank you for the response.I was diagnosed 7 years ago, I had De Quervain's thyroitdis. Back then I can a TSH of 0.003 (Norm 0.490-4.670) after a few months the TSH rose up to 4.70. I went to a doctor and he perscribed me Levothroid 50mg tab. I took this medicine for two years, the TSH was 1.85 (0.40-4.50). I stopped taking the medication and I haven't taken it for a year and over this time, I had a TSH 3rd generation 6.2-5.23.I have high blood pressure, I take Lisinopril for that. The Triglycerides\u00a0\u00a0constantly grows, I now have a bad cholesterol (all 3). The sugar also has been high for quite some time ( I took the test 14 hours after eating).I have a Over Weight, I tried many diets and after losing weight, the weight still increased. I constantly have low body temperature and a slow pulse. Last year, the Iron levels inscreasedThis month I went to an Endocrinologist, he looked at the results and said that I have a healthy thyroid and that I should only diet. I paid 175$ and that's it. I don't know what to do, where I should look for a good Endocrinologist. I live in Denver, Co. Thank you for listening.",

            "answer": "You can get tests for Free T3 and Free T4 at Quest Diagnostics; that's where I get all of my blood work done.Even though your Total T3 and T4 are in range, they are very low in their ranges, and since the Frees are only a minute part of the totals, you can figure they will be low, as well.Maybe some other members can give the name of a doctor who will treat by symptoms, rather just the lab numbers.\u00a0\u00a0You can \"pre-interview\" doctors, prior to making an appointment.\u00a0\u00a0This is usually done by talking with a nurse.\u00a0\u00a0Ask if the doctor treats according to symptoms or goes only by lab work, if the doctor tests for Free T3 and Free T4, if the doctor is willing to prescribe medication with a T3 component.\u00a0\u00a0 You may think of other questions to ask, but those would be the main ones.Remember, a doctor doesn't have to be an endocrinologist to be a good thyroid doctor; and not all endocrinologists ARE good thyroid doctors, as many specialize in diabetes.",
