            "answer": "Do not base your future on this post but it does sound something like leukemia because leukemia is very hard to diagnose. For me I have had many tests as well and I am still not diagnosed but for me my tests started on abdominal discomfort only to find out later that I had a swollen spleen. I had many tests done to me I had a heida scan, 2 ultrasounds, 4 chest x rays, a bi manual, so many blood tests I can't count, numorous physical exams, a ct scan, an abdominal x ray. Did I mention that I am in middle school! Although I am very young I am also very wise when it comes to health and I know what you are going through and to not know what is going on around you! some tips that I can give you is one \" don't be afraid to ask your doctor questions!\" when we go to the doctor I ask more questions then my mom does. Don't be afraid to confront him about leukemia or that you want to know what is going on. Just because they are the ones who are educated in this specific thing it does not mean that you are not aloud to have suggestions to! The second thing that I can tell you that is very importent is \"to keep close track of your symptoms and concerns.\" do this so that when you return to the doctor you can give a thouroh description of what you are experencing and specific detail on your symptoms. This can help the doctors alot to diagnose you. And then the last thing that I can tell you is \" pay close attention on what your body is telling you.\" I learned the hard way that your body can play clever tricks on you and it can be hard to seperate your symptoms from natural aches and pains. If you mention symptoms to your doctor that turn out to be normal and natural it can confuse your doctor in many ways so make sure you pay close attention so that you can help clear the table a little bit for you doctor. I wish you the best of luck and I hope that my advice helps.",

    "question": "I'm 32yr old Male, Married with a 4yr old daughter, I'm 5'8 183lbs I work out about 3-4 times a week (not much cardio though) It all started with me not feeling good, worn down feeling, headaches daily and shortness of breath almost everyday and it was tough for me to bend over to tie my shoes, I went to my doctor thinking I had Diabetes since a friend from work is diabetic so I did a glucose test and my sugar level was almost 200 @ 6am ..... Well my Doc said\u00a0\u00a0no for Diabetes but he sent me to a Rheumotologist because abnormal blood work..My RA was thru the roof (high 60's) my Platelet ct was about 85 my body was producing an exterme amnt of Globuglobin (I think that's how you spell it :) ), my westergren was high 60's and my IGG was about 3300 (now it is 2500).... after 2 months of weekly test's and $25 co-pay's she also found out I have an enlarged Spleen thru an ultra sound and she claimed I have a shot immune system so instead of wasting anymore of my time she told me she was sending me to a Hemo/Onc for more test's and more $25 co-pay's on a weekly basis.... After Bone maroow Biopsy and every other test he is now sending me for a PET scan because abnormal lymphocytes gathered on Bone Marrow.He stated he may need to remove and do a biopsy on my spleen........ what does this sound like? Does anyone know........ he wont tell me, he does not want to work me up until he is for sure.",
