            "answer": "Hi there,Just a little bit extra weight can make your GERD and Hernia symtoms much worse than what it needs to be.\u00a0\u00a0By modifying your diet and by eating healthy you can avoid having to go for surgery.\u00a0\u00a0If a patient has to much abdominal fat, it makes Laparoscopic surgery much more complicated and some times even impossible and then Surgeon has to do Open Fundoplication with more risks and even more complications.Make the decision today to go and see a Dietician and get on a healthy eating plan - almost like Weighless - by eating 5-6 small meals during the day and avoiding acid triggers.You might be surprised how your overall health will improve and your GERD might just become controllable with diet and medication.All the best and let us know how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have a hiatal hernia and am having symptoms no longer controlled by my medication (nexium). I have a full feeling long after eating, get nauseated and sometimes throw up, heartburn, swallowing problems. My question is, my doc says that he won't do surgery because of my weight. I know I'm overweight at 242 pounds. Do you agree that I should not have surgery?",
