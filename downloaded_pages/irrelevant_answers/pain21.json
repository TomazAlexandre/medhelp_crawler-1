            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear that you are in so much pain. Just going to a chiropractor may not help. You need to find the cause of your pain. Unexplained aches and pains coming on and off could be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, anemia, liver disorders, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Vit B12 or Vit D deficiency and due to calcium or magnesium deficiency. It can also be due to sleep related disorders. In men it can be due to low testosterone. Severe anemia, and parathyroid gland disorders can also be the cause. Autoimmune disorders, multiple sclerosis and peripheral neuropathies due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme or lupus too should be investigated for. This needs a comprehensive investigation. Consult a doctor please. Take care!",

            "answer": "I went to a chiropractor for about 2 years. It helped in the short term, but ended up hurting in the long run. One problem I noticed is that once you get an adjustment you have to keep going to get adjusted periodically. If you don't keep going, the pain persists, and even can seem to be worse! I ended up stopping chiropractic the day the actual chiropractor refused to adjust me. I simply had \"too much physically wrong with my spine\", and to go see a \"traditional medical professional\". I bet you don't hear chiropractors say that everyday! Go see a physiatrist-he/she will point you in the right direction for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Good Luck,sean",

    "question": "I went to a chiropractor with the pro adjuster\u00a0\u00a0and after a few visits the pain at the base of my head all the way to my lumbar I have pain. One time he had me lay flat on a table to do it and in the videos it always show the adjustment being done in a special chair that you sit on. I crack every where the pain is so bad I feel burning pinching pressure. Did going there hurt me and is there any help for me to get back my life.",
