    "question": "Hello everyone, I appreciate any one of you for coming inside and trying to help. I will tell my story.. my background: i'm male/24.. usually was healthy except for recurring bacterial tonsillitis a year ago. .one months ago I started to feel weak.. muscles started to twitch and I started to feel tingling in my feet and palms. did some thorough blood tests and everything came out just fine except for an EBV infected from october (I had mono for 2 weeks and then all symptoms went away). was sent to a neurologist and he did an EMG test and everything was fine. he gave me cipralex to ease me up. I took it for 10 days and I stopped because I didn't like the idea of taking it. he told me I can stop it whenever I want. so I stopped. a few days ago I lost something like 60%-70% of my sensation all over my body! it's really severe loss. I barely feel anything. on top of everything I have a weird headache in the back of my head. a few days ago I started to feel pressure on the top of my nose. like someone is touching it. last night i went to the hospital and they tested my blood and everything was fine. they sent a neurologist to test me and she said that everything is fine neurologically since the loss is symmetrical. and she also made the \"look in the eye test\". anyhow i'm really clueless and everyone think that i'm crazy but i'm not. I even didn't feel fire earlier when I lit a candle in my room(as a part of a relaxation session everyone told me to try.. because i'm too anxious about my condition). please please try to help me.. thank you very very much for your help!botimat",
