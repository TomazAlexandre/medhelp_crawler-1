            "answer": "Hello, I've worked in the diabetes market for a while now and understand the differences between the various types of insulins.. i am also a type 1 diabetic. The previous posts explain very well the differences. If you are a type 1 than you most likely be on lantus with another fast acting insulin. The premixed insulins (such as 30/70 and mix30) are more targeted for type 2 diabetics who dont need as much flexibility with their dosing and are not on a more intense therapy. 30/70 is a fixed dose system, meaning if you test and you're a little high right now you can add more 30/70, however you are also adding more longacting insulin as well... ie. 1 unit increase in the short acting is also 1 unit more increase in the long acting. This is perhaps not exactly what you need as your sugars say 6 hours from now are not running high.Also, the premixes are usually used once a day to two times a day (because of the amount of the long acting insulin), most type 1's are on 3 times a day or more therapy which has proven to be most optimal in control.Hope this helps.",
