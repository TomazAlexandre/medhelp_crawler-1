            "answer": "Hello dear booboo, welcome to the medhelp forum. Did you hurt your right foot? This swelling and redness could be due to a leg infection, secondary to trauma and bleeding or a blood clot in the leg. Have you undergone any recent surgery on the right leg, ankle or the foot? Is there any history of varicose veins or defective valves in the leg veins? I hope you are not taking any hormone like estrogens, perimenopausal? This needs urgent attention by a surgeon. Have you been checked for diabetes? It could be an abscess needing urgent drainage. You must go to the emergency room and an urgent x ray done to check for any ankle fracture. Duplex ultrasound is indicated if there is a suspicion of vascular disease or blockage in blood vessel or a clot. I cannot comment further without a clinical evaluation. It would be prudent to get a surgeon\u2019s consultation immediately. Hope this helps. Take care.",

            "answer": "This is a condition for an emergency room, as Dr. Scharma suggested. As of yesterday. Diabetes is one possibility, however oclusion of a blood vessel is another (perhaps from a clot), and there is a limited window of time for intervention.",
