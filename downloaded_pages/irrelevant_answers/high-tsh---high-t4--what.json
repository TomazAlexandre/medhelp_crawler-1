            "answer": "I agree that it is time for testing. Make sure you find an endo who specializes in thyroid and not diabetes, as most do. You may have to do some searching. Has anyone done pituitary testing on you? Also have you had a free t3 test done to see where that level is? that is the most active hormone (thyroid).",

            "answer": "This is just a thought on something else you might research.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't had a lot of time to do much on it myself yet, and what I did see was pretty difficult reading.\u00a0\u00a0All very technical.Anyway, I was recently told by my endo that I have \"PITUITARY resistance to thyroid hormones\".\u00a0\u00a0Some people develop a deficiency in the enzyme (5-prime deiodinase) that converts T3 to T4 in the pituitary.\u00a0\u00a0Because the pituitary can't convert T4 to T3 for itself, it thinks the rest of the body is also starving for T3 and just keeps cranking out TSH.\u00a0\u00a0Now, for me this isn't a problem because I have Hash's also, and my my thyroid isn't responding much to the TSH.\u00a0\u00a0However, if your thyroid were healthy, this would drive your FT4 up.\u00a0\u00a0There was no specific test for this.\u00a0\u00a0It was based on my TSH, FT3 and FT4 and my symptoms.Just a thought...Can you google the doctor who did your original tests?\u00a0\u00a0If he wrote a paper, it ought to be out there in cyberspace somewhere, if its still credible.",

    "question": "HX:Diabetic X 15 yearsHTN:\u00a0\u00a05+ yearsAGE: 41About 10 years ago an endocrinologist diagnosed me with the condition Familial Dysalbuminemic Hyperthyroxinemia (FDH).\u00a0\u00a0He had written an article regarding this fairly unique genetic \"condition\".\u00a0\u00a0He told me to NEVER let anyone touch my thyroid gland, levels etc.\u00a0\u00a0I do not remember what my lab values were back then and he is no longer my endocrinologist.My concern is my labs since that time have always been confusing to doctors.\u00a0\u00a0I tell them I have this condition and not to mess with my thyroid and they usually don't question me, which is also a concern.My concern is that I actually am hypothyroid.\u00a0\u00a0(I have had a lot of issues with weight gain/feeling cold/depression/memory issues; and I am following a healthy diet - I have always blamed this on my Type 1 diabetes).\u00a0\u00a0Recent labs came back as follows:\u00a0\u00a0TSH 8.472 (Normals 0.450-4.50)\u00a0\u00a0and T4 16.5 (Normals 4.5-12.0).\u00a0\u00a0If this matters, all other labs were normal except for a High Iron Serum level of 181 (Normal 40-155)After doing my own research, I only found one condition that causes High TSH + High T4, which is thyroid hormone resistance.\u00a0\u00a0When I researched FDH it indicated lab values would show NORMAL TSH with elevated T4.\u00a0\u00a0I am confused.\u00a0\u00a0The endocrinologist who diagnosed me with FDH said that did specialized tests for this diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Can you tell me what these tests might be so that I can have them done again with my new endocrinologist to ease my mind?Also, is it possible to have the genetic condtion FDH and be hypothyroid?\u00a0\u00a0I do have an appointment with my endo in the near future.\u00a0\u00a0Just wanted some other opinions.Thanks for any help you can give me.",
