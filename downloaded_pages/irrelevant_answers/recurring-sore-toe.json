            "answer": "That looks like a neglected infection.\u00a0\u00a0The infection can make its way to the bone or your bloodstream so if you have kids I don't know why you are not taking this seriously.If this were an early infection in a person who was SURE they didn't have diabetes, I would say to soak it in warm salt water 2 times days a day, but this looks like you've let it get beyond that.\u00a0\u00a0Curing this is not going to be just swallowing a pill or applying ointment.\u00a0\u00a0It will take treatment, including I&D and elevation and time to clear this up.",
