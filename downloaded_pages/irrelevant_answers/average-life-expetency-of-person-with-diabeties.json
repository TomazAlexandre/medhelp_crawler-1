            "answer": "Doctors need to tell young diabetic patients about the risk of possible damages due to diabetes because many people need that fear to motivate them to do all the work needed to keep blood sugars under control. If you go searching about life expectancy and diabetes, you will find that manyn type 2 diabetics do die younger than other adults, but this is largely because of obesity. For the type 1 diabetic, obesity is rarely an issue. Twenty years ago, the prognosis for type 1 diabetics was not as good as it is today, for home blood glucose montoring was not possible, and the type 1 diabetic had to somewhat guess at his or her control, using only tests for glucose in urine to tell them whether blood sugar was high. This was not nearly as accurate as actual blood glucose monitoring, and so insulin and food amounts were sort of a best guess scenario.However, now we have new insulins available and home glucose monitoring is accurate and dependable. Pumps are available for those who wish to use them, and lantus insulin is there as a new type that can provide a constant drip of insulin very much like what the normal pancreas does. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever for a type 1 diabetic to not be able to tightly control blood glucose in this modern age and therefore protect themselves from the long-term damages.I am a long-term type 1 diabetic, having grown up with it and having seen the changes in technology for my 34 years with the disease. Even without the technology we have today to help us, I have managed to live without any damage of any sort from the disease thus far. I am now 46. I strongly suspect that young people who are being diagnosed now will find that their life expectancy is very much the same as people with healthy pancreases. The statistics won't be in for another generation, but I think you will find that you can live a very long life with diabetes now because of the advent of home glucometers and so many types of insulin and pumps that make it possible for you to set up a system that works well for you personally and for your lifestyle. There are so many choices now that make it possible to be successful at managing your diabetes.Now, all of that being said, I must warn you that YOU are the one in control, and that you do need to stay motivated to keep up the daily work at keeping those glucose numbers as normal as possible. Those that I hear from who are having difficulties with their health tend to be people who have never mastered the self-control that a diabetic must utilize every single day to keep their blood sugar levels within a normal range. These people do find that they have eye or kidney or heart problems starting, and they become suddenly very frightened after years of basically ignoring their condition. You will indeed reap what you sow when it comes to diabetes. It is not easy, but it is very possible to live a very active and healthy life, and I am living proof of that fact. I intend to still be kicking when I am 90, and I hope that you do, too.",

            "answer": "G-I'm so sad whenever I hear that DMers (that's what I use as a short hand for folks like us with Diabetes Mellitus) are given a doomsday story.\u00a0\u00a0There are MANY otherwise-healthy DMers who live long, rich & happy lives.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed as a teen, and now ~35 years later I am 48.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks to continuing advances in my own blood sugar monitoring and treatment (thanks, in part to the research funded by JDRF, by the way!) and my own motivation to live long & prosper ;-) ... I'm at least as healthy as my non DM pals.My sister has had DM for 10 years longer than I have.\u00a0\u00a0She was diagnosed at an earlier age & is older than I am.I have met DMers who have lived successfully with the disease for 60 or 70+ years and they are among the \"wise old souls\" still with us today.Do all you can to take excellent care of yourself.\u00a0\u00a0This is a chronic disease and requires something like a marathoner's attitude.It absolutely DOES matter how we take care of ourselves.\u00a0\u00a0While some may be lucky enuf to have genetics that protect 'em from the ravages that uncontrolled blood sugars bring, I'm not counting on that luck ... I'm counting on the things I can control (somewhat):\u00a0\u00a0my attitude, my behaviors, and my commitment to getting good medical & mental health care.\u00a0\u00a0It's my hope for you, too.Waddya think?",

            "answer": "Like LRS, I have lived with diabetes for 34 years, and have no damages at this point from the disease. My overall health is BETTER than most of my peers, for I am fit and active and do not have the weight issues that afflict so many in middle years. With modern advances, there is no reason at all that you cannot live a full and healthy life if you stay on top of those glucose levels which can harm you if let go too high or low. I have played USTA tennis, spent two years as a white water raft guide, and now frequently orgnanize kayak trips with people I work with. I have had two successful pregnancies, and raised two wonderful healthy kids to adulthood. Never let a physician tell you that you cannot have a full life, for you can. It isn't easy, and at times we all slip up and make mistakes, but if you build a healthy lifestyle and stay on top of the glucose readings, there is no reason you cannot live long and prosper. LRS and I are living proof of that, and we were raised in the dark ages before home glucose monitoring or pumps were available.",

            "answer": "Just my 2 cents .....I understand where gmoney is coming from.\u00a0\u00a0I got the same scary \"you'll probably have a shorter than normal person's lifespan\" and \"you'll probably have to switch to a less active lifestyle\" talk from my first endo my second day in the hospital after being diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0I was already extremely depressed; paranoid about all the insulin shots; confused at what had happened to me; unsure about how I would even eat the next day; and so frightened that I thought I was losing it all together .... the last thing *I* needed to hear from a doctor was that I was now going to die long before my time.After I switched endocrinologists, my new endo calmed me down and explained that was the *worst* case scenario (he was also at a loss to explain why my first endo would scare the heck out of me on my second day without mentioning this).\u00a0\u00a0It was what would happen if I didn't keep my sugars in range or didn't do anything to help myself manage the damage that Diabetes left me to live with.\u00a0\u00a0He even mentioned a player from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an example of how even a diabetic can play active sports like pro football and live a perfectly normal life.We all have limited lifespans - whether we have Diabetes or not.\u00a0\u00a0It's a fact of life.\u00a0\u00a0At some point our number will be up - it happens to everyone.\u00a0\u00a0But Diabetes doesn't necessarily cut our lives shorter .... as long as you don't give up and neglect yourself.I figure Diabetes has taken away a lot from me and I've had to fight and will have to continue to fight to reclaim my life back from what it did to me.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not about to let it push me in a corner and take any more of my life.",

            "answer": "Your e-mail was deleted by MedHelp. Why are you afraid to tell your parents? Diabetes is not something to be ashamed of and they might be good support for you during this time of adjustment. There is a lot to learn but if you pay attention to testing and eating properly you will be able to manage your diabetes and live your life healthy and doing the things you already enjoy. Unfortunately, nobody can give you a set of menus to follow. We are all different in what things we can eat without spiking our blood sugar. In general, though, you should eliminate sugar and reduce carbs. The key is to test two hours after eating and the goal is to have your blood sugar at 140 or lower at that time. If it is higher than you may not have dosed correctly or you may not be able to tolerate that food or that portion. I recommend the book Using Insulin by John Walsh.\u00a0\u00a0I am sending you a private message on here with the names of other websites that have thousands of diabetics who can guide you and give you information.",

That doesn't mean some won't live to 90 and that doesn't mean that 9 year olds won't be diagnosed by autopsy, but on average in the US we live to be about 78. With type 1 juvenile onset on average it is about 71.",

Do you determine his bolus dose by counting carbs? Do you know his I:C ratio for each meal? Do you know his correction factor to correct if he is high two hours after meals? If you don't understand all these things you need to find an endo who will work with you until you do. I also highly recommend the book Using Insulin by John Walsh.

The reality of it is this:I decided back in late 1984 I was going to live my life with diabetes, not let diabetes run my life. Once you make that decision it will be much easier both mentally and physically. I did this back when you had to p** on a strip to check sugars, no A1c's and doctors saying I'd die by 50. I'm 53 now, married with 3 grown non diabetic children, run our business, go atv and snowmobiling, drive anything gone flying and have done anything a non diabetic does. My worst problem was kidney stones so far and all testing at the doc's office says very good condition. If I can do all this so can you with today's technology,\u00a0\u00a0At this point check your sugars 4-6 times a day, keep them in the 100-120 on average, get outside and get some exercise, try to eat low fat and enjoy life!",
