I read on one site that you don't have to have cysts to be diagnosed. I believe its hereditary. My mom was thin and had irregular periods and had it. I had irregular periods since I started my period and have been active all my live and was always dieting and no matter what, I just kept gaining and gaining weight. Out of nowhere, 4 yrs ago I gained 20 pounds and have been struggling since to lose it.",

            "answer": "I was referred by my OB/GYN to a reproductive endocrinologist due to a lack of periods after stopping oral contraceptives.\u00a0\u00a0The biggest concern was a lack of ovulation, since we were TTC.I had a few symptoms of PCOS, but not enough to have a firm diagnosis. I am within normal range for weight with no recent fluxuations, no problems with hair loss or acne, no signs of diabetes, insulin resistance, or thyroid imbalances. After a series of bloodwork and ultrasounds, the specialist diagnosed me with PCOS - which was causing anovulation. The signs/symptoms used to diagnose were: cysts on both ovaries, high cholesterol, abnormal/absent periods, and an elevated AMH level. Also, I have a family history on my mother's side for ovulation/fertility issues. My specialist told me that not everyone who has insulin resistance will have it show up on the \"traditional\" tests (fasting glucose; Glucose Tolerance Test). He recommended a fasting blood insulin level to double-check that I didn't have a hidden insulin resistance problem. This test also came back normal, so no need for metformin in my case. My understanding is that metformin can be very helpful in weight loss - but only if there is a true insulin resistance issue present.I would agree with the thought of PCOS being more of a hormone imbalance. Cysts on the ovaries are only one possible component, but since the ovaries are responsible for releasing hormones - the two are very closely linked.Are you TTC? If so, you may want to consider an infertility workup with a specialist. If not, have you considered oral contraceptives? My doctor told me that I have probably had these issues for many years, but they were \"fixed\" temporarily by taking the pill. Maybe \"masked\" is a better word, but either way I didn't notice any issues.Good luck! :0)",
