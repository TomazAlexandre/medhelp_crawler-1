            "answer": "Hi! From you symptoms alone it sounds like chronic fatigue syndrome. This usually presents with widespread myalgia and arthralgia, headaches, chronic mental and physical exhaustion, cognitive difficulties, concentration difficulty and memory problems.Then you also need to investigate other causes of brain fog like liver dysfunction (get liver enzymes done\u2014liver function test), kidney dysfunction (get kidney function test done), and anemia. Poor sleep pattern and sleep problems like sleep apnea too can cause brain fog. Sleep studies by sleep specialists can help diagnose this. Low Vit D or Vit B12 too could be the cause.Hypothyroidism, diabetes and low testosterone should be investigated.Discuss this with your general practitioner or PCP and try and assess what is the cause of your problem. Then proper referral for concerned specialist can take things further and get you proper treatment. Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "In July of 2010 I began experiencing episodes of weakness and confusion which generally lasted from 30 minutes to several hours.\u00a0\u00a0These episodes disappeared after several weeks and returned in mid October.\u00a0\u00a0Since October I've experienced these episodes more days than not.\u00a0\u00a0I've been unable to pinpoint any exact cause, but I do know that strenuous exercise will almost certainly trigger a \"strong\" episode.\u00a0\u00a0For the past week the symptoms have been lasting most of the day, and the only remedy I've found to these episodes, taking a nap, is no longer effective.\u00a0\u00a0I've been to my doctor several times and the only abnormality on any test was a single raised creatinine level (1.5) when blood was drawn while I was actually feeling rotten.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 31 and other than having my gall-bladder removed when I was 16, I've been rather healthy.\u00a0\u00a0I don't drink, smoke, do any drugs, most summers I bicycle several thousand miles, ...\u00a0\u00a0There is a family history of heart disease, diabetes, ...\u00a0\u00a0My Dr. is stumped.\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts?Notes on the episodes:- Weakness throughout body, but especially legs and arms- My brain feels cloudy and I have a difficult time with tasks that I'd normally find easy- Retention of information while in a episode is just horrible- Recently I've noticed an uncomfortable \"full\" feeling in my stomachThanks for your help!!!",
