Either it is peripheral neuropathy or a pinched nerve. Other than this it can also be deep vein thrombosis, which can be diagnosed by duplex ultrasounds. Take care!",

            "answer": "the first thing that comes to mind is that the nausea can be a symptom from the headache. Migraines can make you very sensitive to light, sound, smell and taste. A headache that does not go away for 3 weeks, that is a long time. I must ask is where is the the pain. If it is more in the front and your forehead is swollen I would think more towards sinus issues. Even allergies. Try some OTC meds for sinus pressure or allergies. If this is your issue you should feel better rather fast. If it is not I would go to your closest ER as they will run more tests and give you a better answer.",
