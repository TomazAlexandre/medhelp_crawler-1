            "answer": "Hi, i think your girlfriend is suffering hyperthyroidism,The endo you have seen does he specialise in diabetes as i would be looking for a good second opinion, and with an endo who specialises in thyroid issues.Has you girlfriend been tested for thyroid anti-bodies, like a TSI anti bodie test.Youre giving all the symptoms off hyper thyroid ,so since your girlfriend is experiencing symptoms, i would definately be pushing for a second opinion.Maybe your endo . doesnt realise that anxiety issues are caused when you are experiencing hyper thyroidism. How dare he call your girlfriend an hypochondriac, but i have lived to learn that endos would rather give a phsycological diagnosis rather than the real thing.Hope this helps,",

            "answer": "Please explain to me how you call someone with labs like your girlfriend's a hypochondriac...that's a disgusting comment.First of all, she needs to see someone who knows which labs to order.\u00a0\u00a0Both sets of labs should have included free T3, free T4 and TSH.\u00a0\u00a0TSH alone is not adequate to diagnose thyroid disease.\u00a0\u00a0I agree with thyroidian...she needs to find a doctor who either specializes in thyroid or, at the very least, is a \"generalist\".\u00a0\u00a0It's impossible for him to say that a \"bout of inflammation\" led to these numbers...the initial tests weren't repeated, so he has no clue what's going on.Don't give up...pursue this with a new doctor.",

    "question": "My girlfriend has been experiencing symptoms of hyperthyroidism since June 2009 including tremors, tachycardia (resting 100bpm), palpitations, dizziness, thinning hair, weight loss, anxiety etc. She has had two rounds of blood work.November 2009TSH 0.30 (range .49-4.67) LOWT4 12.6 (range 4.5-12.5) HIGHDecember 2009TSH 0.72 (range 0.4-4.0) NormalT Uptake 31.6 (range 32-48.4) LOWThyroperoxidase 2.1An ultrasound did not indicate any abnormalities.At her ENT recommendation she visited an endocrinologist today and provided her results to him.\u00a0\u00a0The Endo said she was a hypochondriac with anxiety issues that may have had a bout of inflammation that led to these numbers and that there is nothing in these values that would give him any reason to recommend treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Does that sound like a valid conclusion?\u00a0\u00a0I seem to think there is plenty to warrant further assessment/treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your help.",
