When I think about it my weight has remained amazingly the same since I started treatment a year ago (175 pounds given or taken 2 or 3). I think you should rejoice if the TX reduced yours and keeps doing that to you gradually. Loosing pounds will help you in every of the areas you described: diabete; cardiovascular system, blood pressure, joints, mobility, etc...",

(especially in my thighs & tummy area)I have gained 4 lbs in the past month, but I actually WANTED to gain a few lbs to see if it would help \"fill me out\" again.\u00a0\u00a0It has worked and I do look better.\u00a0\u00a0I'm really going to try to keep myself at my current weight, because I feel really limber and comfortable. Friends & family are all telling me that I look wonderful.\u00a0\u00a0Now the work starts to maintain my diet and exercise routines.My stomach shrunk during tx, and I am still eating much smaller portions so my stomach doesn't stretch larger.\u00a0\u00a0I usually get full by eating half a regular adult portion.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a really cheap date! LOLIt feels good to be able to be in the sun again and to do yard work. I still get little dizzy spells occasionally, but I figure that's just the meds which are probably still wearing off.Have a good one!-E",

    "question": "During my 48 week tx I lost 30 lbs, from 270 ( my highest weight ever ) down to 240. Right now I'm weighing in at 233 or so. I'm not doing anything in particular to lose the weight. A little more work outside. Maybe it's the additional energy/metabolism.Also, before my tx I was what was called borderline type II diabetic. I've noticed that now, even after a large meal, my blood sugar comes down relatively quickly to the proper number 105-110 within about an hour. I was worried about his because I've been having some bouts of dizziness lately. Not fatigue per say,\u00a0\u00a0more of a lightheadedness. More common late at night. I find myself sleeping less as well but all in all I feel pretty good. IT may be the weening off the anti-d's.Also, my blood pressure has been really easy to keep down these days. As usual, I always have a problem with the systolic being high and if I medicate to get that down, the dystolic(sp) gets really low but this AM I was right at 130/75 which is pretty darn good.Anyway, anyone else continue to lose weight after tx ?\u00a0\u00a0I thought I'd blow up like a balloon but that hasn't been the case.",
