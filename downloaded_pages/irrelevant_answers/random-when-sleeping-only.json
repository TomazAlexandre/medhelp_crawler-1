            "answer": "Hello,Your symptom is called polyuria (excessive frequency of voiding). It can be due to many reasons which can be physiological or disease-related, and include excessive intake of liquids, diuretic substances (including tea, caffeine, alcohol, certain drugs), anxiety, exposure to cold, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus (central or nephrogenic), urinary tract infections or obstruction, etc to name a few more common ones.In your case, urinary tract infection should be ruled out by getting a complete urine examination and a urine culture done.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "Hello for the last 3 days I am feeling random pain somewhere around the groin area (inside thighs, maybe in the urinary bladder, I am not sure). What's weird is it only happens when I am sleeping and the random pain wake me up. I do not feel pain while urinating but I think it's something related to my urinary tract. Anybody knows what it may possibly be? Thanks.",
