            "answer": "Hi,I'm visiting from Feb forum.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed at 6 weeks pregnant with GD also based on the fasting level being high.\u00a0\u00a0My post sugar levels were within normal range.When it comes to GD far better to be safe than sorry.\u00a0\u00a0If you really have it mild then you will be able to manage it with diet and exercise....All for the benefit of baby... and you'll be fine..i was unfortunate and got onto insulin at about 3 1/2 months (though i kind of doubted my doctor's diagnosis at the beginning).\u00a0\u00a0Then with the insulin it was easy to control my sugar levels up until about 7 months, but now it is a really challenge to maintain the target blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0But should all be fine after baby arrives.\u00a0\u00a0You can manage.",

    "question": "I posted on here last week regarding my 1-hr GTT. I failed the 139 limit w/ a reading of 141.I took my 3-hr GTT last Tuesday and my readings were:Fasting 101\u00a0\u00a0 Needed to be <951 Hour\u00a0\u00a0177\u00a0\u00a0 Needed to be <1802 Hour\u00a0\u00a0141\u00a0\u00a0 Needed to be <1553 Hour\u00a0\u00a0102\u00a0\u00a0 Needed to be <140Once again the nurse practitioner told me that because my fasting glucose reading was high, that I am automatically diagnosed with gestational diabetes. She told me that my body can't handle the glucose. I told her that it was my FASTING result that was high & I hadn't even had any glucose. After the glucose, everything was under what it should have been. She said, \"Oh.\"\u00a0\u00a0Isn't that nice???On my results and on everything I\"ve been researching since Tuesday, it says that TWO OR MORE readings need to be met or exceeded in order to diagnose GD.So, I have to go to a diabetes educator tomorrow for a 2hr meeting. I am really angry about this and in denial because I don't actually think that I have it. I don't like this NP because I really don't think she knows what the hell she is doing & because of her I am seriously considering changing my clinics even though I really love my OB.My mom gave me a glucose meter (she is Type 2) and I've been monitoring my blood 3-4 times a day, esp. after meals. Everything has been in the normal range.I've got calls in to my doctor about this. I\"m just wondering if anyone else has had this problem.",
