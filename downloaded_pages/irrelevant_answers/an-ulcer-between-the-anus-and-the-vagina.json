            "answer": "Hi,This could be a boil. It is caused by the infection of hair follicles, which become filled with pus and dead tissue.They present as\u00a0\u00a0red bumps that are tender, warm, and/or painful. Boils are generally caused by an infection of the hair follicles by Staphylococcus aureus, a strain of bacterium that normally lives on the skin surface.\u00a0\u00a0Tiny cuts/abrasions\u00a0\u00a0of the skin allows this bacterium to enter the follicles and cause an infection.People with diabetes, poor hygiene or malnutrition (Vitamin A or E deficiency) are more prone to getting them repeatedly.Most boils run their course within 4 to 10 days. Applying warm compresses will hasten the discharging of the boil. after which you can clean the area with an antiseptic and apply an antibiotic ointment on it.ref:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boil",

            "answer": "I have a large lump under the skin that goes from under the end of my vagina and runs alongside my anus. It is hard and is causing me a lot of pain. I am 51 years old and have had a history of severe hemerroids as well as cervical cancer that was lazered out some 15 years ago. Around the same time I was soaking a great deal in the tub to reduce my hemerroid pain and 1 day it seemed like my skin opened up in this same area and a very smelly green slime drained out. I haven't felt lumps down there since until now. Please help!",
