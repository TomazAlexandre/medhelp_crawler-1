            "answer": "Hi,What is your name? How are you feeling?The pain and numbness you are describing suggests that your median nerve is still having some dysfunction.This could be due to injury as you told or could be due to Vitamin B12 deficiency or due to diabetes.I think you should be consulting a neurologist and physician to rule out all suspected pathologies.If required I think you should be doing imaging studies to rule any bony abnormalities if present.You can ask for Vitamin B12 supplementation from your physician.Discuss these options with your doctor.Keep me informed.Bye.",
