    "question": "I have a neutered male cat that will be 15 in May. The last week or so, he's been sitting next to his water bowl not drinking and meowing. At first I thought the water might not be fresh enough, so I rinsed the bowl and refilled it, but he just stares at the bowl and cries. He was drinking to the point that I'd have to refill the bowl every day; now if it's only down about a half an inch, so he does drink some, but not as much as usual. What could be the problem?",
