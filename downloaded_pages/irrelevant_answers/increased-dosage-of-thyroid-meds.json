            "answer": "Please post your current levels as soon as you can.\u00a0\u00a0That will help us better evaluate your situation.The medication should not have had that effect, but different strength pills have different fillers/binders, so you could have reacted to that, which would explain the pain going away when you stop taking the 100 mcg pills.You might ask your doctor to switch you to a brand name med, such as synthroid or Tirosint.",

    "question": "I have just been increased on my thyroid medication from 75 to 100 mcg of levothryoxin and I found that today it caused me a very bad upset stomach like I had a hole in my stomach.. does this happen with this drug? And the 75mcg did not help me when I was putting on the pds and sleeping all the time..and felt depressed.. are these symptoms of this medical issue and is there a cure??",
