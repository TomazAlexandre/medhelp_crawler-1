            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without being able to take history from you and to examine you, I cannot tell you what the cause of your blurred vision is, and I cannot give you a diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0That said, carotid artery narrowings are usually graded on a scale (e.g. 0-29%, 30-50%, etc).\u00a0\u00a0The nurse is correct, for someone of your age, unless you were having lots of symptoms clearly related to the narrowing of your carotid artery.\u00a0\u00a0This association is\u00a0\u00a0apparently less clear in your situation and there are many reasons for blurred vision in someone your age.\u00a0\u00a0If your visual changes happened very suddenly, in one eye, and it was like a black curtain coming down, this would be classical for a small stroke.\u00a0\u00a0 Other times one can lose vision in both eyes but on the same side (e.g. loss of vision looking to the left).\u00a0\u00a0If your visual changes were distinct from these scenarios and weren't otherwise accompanied by any other symptoms or changes in exam, it's less likely a stroke and other causes should be sought.\u00a0\u00a0In the acute setting, if the history is suggestive of a stroke, physicians will often get some brain imaging (CT or MRI) though neither of these is 100% sensitive to the very smallest of strokes.Reducing your stroke risk, however, can be accomplished by getting your LDL cholesterol down (after a stroke it's recommended to get it below 70), stopping smoking, attaining tight control of blood pressure and diabetes, losing weight, and exercising.\u00a0\u00a0If you doctor feels it's appropriate, a baby aspirin taken daily can also help as can a drug called an ACE Inhibitor.",

            "answer": "I also have occulasion ( blockage) in the left cartroid artery.\u00a0\u00a0My % is more than 49%.\u00a0\u00a0I also have 100% blocked vestrael in the back of the neck. This is another ave of the cartroid artety which has already made new \"roads\" and \"paths\" so the blood continues flowing.\u00a0\u00a0There is nothing they can do for this, since it is in the back of the brain.\u00a0\u00a0As far as the cartroid goes, It is too soon to operate just yet.\u00a0\u00a0The risks are to high until it is absolutely necessary, about 90% blocked. Then they will do something.\u00a0\u00a0They should monitor you about twice a year with ultrasound (cartroid) and keep an eye on it.\u00a0\u00a0Your blockage isn't enough to have a stroke at that site due to that amt of blockage. There are many reasons this happens at your age, genetics, family history, high cholesterol, diet.\u00a0\u00a0You should be fine.....",

    "question": "I am 49 years old, female.\u00a0\u00a0A dopler recently showed 49% blockage in the carotid artery on both sides.\u00a0\u00a0I have had normal cholesteral until recently, when it went up to slightly above normal.\u00a0\u00a0Is this much blockage to be expected in a 49 year old?\u00a0\u00a0The reason I had the doplar was due to unexplained blurred vision.\u00a0\u00a0When I was given the results over the phone by the nurse, all I was told was that it wasn't enough blockage to do anything about.\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned due to a strong history of strokes in the females in my family, and the unexplained blurred vision.Thank you.",
