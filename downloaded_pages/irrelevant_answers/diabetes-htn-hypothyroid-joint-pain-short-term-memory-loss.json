            "answer": "Nothing is really \"common\" and it all depends on the individual's body but you should be warned that there can be side effects before starting treatment.Unfortunately, most of our doctors don't tell us these things and it's only when we have a big problem that we go to them and they then do.That is why I truly believe it is each persons responsibility to learn as much as they can about THEIR disease.\u00a0\u00a0That way they can catch things as they happen.Since the side effects don't happen to everyone and it's impossible to figure out what will - they don't really tell us what could I guess because they dont want us to freak out.",

When a person is ill, they are not in the best position to research and I live in a rural area and was not computer savvy at that time.I trusted my Dr. who promised \"a full recovery\", period. I went on forum merely to ask if others are having my same problems. I do think informed consent is imperative.",

My mother took sulfa and lost ALL of her skin and mucous membranes and spent six months in the burn center of the areas biggest hospital.They didn't tell her THAT could happen - but yup there it was as one of the possible side effects.It is pretty much our responsiblity to read the inserts that come with the medications from the pharmacy or drug company. I know that ALL of the meds I have taken in the past few years they always say do you have any questions for the pharmacist? and they include an insert into the bag with instructions and side effects.It would be kind of stupid for a doctor to say anything that might EVER happen because honestly we'd never take anything ever again.I don't think you were used as a guinea pig...they pretty much do know all of the sides that might happen with these regular meds - and if you sign up for a TRIAL (ie: Vertex) you realize that is WHY you are in the trial.Remember - those side effects most of them can be caused by just simple old old age...something we just all have to deal with.",

That isn't \"chiding\" you. A doctor can't verbally go over every possible problem that can arise on any medication, we have to read the inserts. The evidence that is available shows that MOST people do not have these issues after treatment but some do. Doctors can be blamed for a lot of things but it is our responsibility to read the info given to us and ask questions rather than their duty to list all possible side effects.
