            "answer": "I've heard that dates can be off by a couple weeks since babies develop at their own rate. Whether or not it can be as big a gap as 4 weeks I'm not sure. Also the heartbeat doesn't mean anything and it seems like it gets slower as the baby gets older. The first time I heard the heartbeat it was in the 170's... then next time it was in the 150-160's and stayed like that the majority of the pregnancy and then at about 30 weeks it was in the 140's-150's and when I delivered it was at about 120-130. Also babies heart rates depend on what they are doing. If they are playing or awake it is usually higher where as if they are sleeping or resting it is usually lower.",
