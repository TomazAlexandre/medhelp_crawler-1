            "answer": "Freshgrape,As you know, we're volunteers here, not medical professionals.\u00a0\u00a0I\"m glad you're going to get a call from your doctor. The symptoms you describe *are* consistent with diabetes.In addition, a blood sugar of 167 may (or may not) indicate diabetes, depending on when that reading was taken.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, your dad's readings in the 400s are extremely high and quite dangerous on a long-term basis.\u00a0\u00a0Given your weight and your symptoms, I'd encourage you to read about diabetes and how to care for yourself in ways that will not only bring your blood sugars into the normal range (typically 70-120) but will also help you feel much better physically & mentally.It is one thing to know \"about\" diabetes and to see others who have it.\u00a0\u00a0It is quite something else to learn about diabetes and the careful balance we strive for between our foods, meds, exercise & rest.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps you can inspire your dad to find the courage to do better, too.While our site focuses on Type 1 (juvenile) diabetes -- a different disease -- there are many similarities including the dangers we face from sustained high blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Here's a reliable website with information about normal blood sugars, pre-diabetes, and diabetes http://www.diabetes.org They have helpful info to learn about diabetes (be patient since there's a LOT to learn beyond \"avoid sugar\").\u00a0\u00a0Please get in touch with your doctor, too.",

            "answer": "I have an idea about a cause of diabetes, more times than not, is an exposure to 2-butoxyethanol that is very rampant in our society, and has been so for 80 years or so.It causes autoimmune metabolic issues; so overweight may not be your fault.\u00a0\u00a0I also have type 2 diabetes, which in my case I suspect is a birth defect from my dad's WWII Navy service.\u00a0\u00a0Bomb fumes in eyes ... and that is the worst exposure, then there are several types of birth defects, even brain tumors and leukemia which are possible.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes gets more credit for causing harm than it should, if you ask me.\u00a0\u00a0It is a cause of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and to prove its harm you have to prove the fatigue that doctors say they don't know what it is.When you do see a doctor be sure to ask if there is blood in urine and whether or not red blood cells are small-sized.\u00a0\u00a0Well, that would be if you had your own direct exposure;\u00a0\u00a0it doesn't show up if it is a birth defect ... just singular items ... then look for the CFIDS or CFS symptoms in one or both of your parents.The fatigue would be autoimmune hemolytic anemia if it is from 2-butoxyethanol.\u00a0\u00a0It is a rest that sleeping does not help with.\u00a0\u00a0I've written lots of web pages on this chemical and the effects I suspect.\u00a0\u00a0Here are 2:http://www.valdezlink.com/pages/diabetes.htmandhttp://www.valdezlink.com/pages/foryourdoctor.htm#for",

    "question": "Hi,Im posting because i have a concern. I know that only Dr. is going to be able to help me get to the bottom of whats going on. I thought maybe i could get your take on my situation. I have OSA aka sleep apnea. I been feeling very tired and worn down lately. I was thinking that maybe i was having a problem with my machine that controls this. But i just went to see my nurse today. And she said even though the Dr. is going to get back to me. She said from just looking at my readings nothing is wrong. Well this worrys me. To give you idea about me im overweight. Both my parents have dieabetes and mom is indian and her mom had diabetes too and my whole relation on that side. I know that puts me at high risk. Well for the last two months i been worn down. Even though i been getting enough hours of sleep when i first wake up i feel the worst..even though im tired after being up for a while i feel little better put towards night i feel real tired again. But i have trouble falling asleep. I been feeling irratable. And kind of foggy minded. I also been feeling more hungry. I also been peeing alot. But i didn't think much of it..i thought maybe it was because of my weight. It feels like i have to pee every 20 mins. But i don't feel like i been anymore thrist then usual. I also been having blurry eyes. I have dry eyes. Sorry for all the detials i was wondering if any of these things sounded like diabetes. I know it could be alot of things. Besides both my parents having diabetes the whole thing that made me concerned that this is what it might be. I tried my moms meter and it said my blood sugar was 167. I know this isn't high my dads is in the 400s.I did drink soda beforehand But i guess my secound question is; is this normal for non-diebectic to have sugar at this level even after surgary drink. Sorry about the length any help would be greatly appericated.",
