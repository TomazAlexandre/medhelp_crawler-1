            "answer": "The answer is \"maybe yes\" and \"maybe no\". That's the good news. The bad news is that often the condition, once developed, ir irreversible. Chronically elevated glucise levels cause the progression of both microangiopathy and macroangiopathy. To cut to the chase lesions and deposits form within the walls of tiny blood vessels and the penis is no longer able to retain blood.
