            "answer": "Yes. Orgasm is realated to ejaculation. When you orgasm, your body releases the hold on your semen and lets it flow out. It usually isn't a health concern, but sometimes it's a side effcect of recent trauma or surgery. There are a few possible reasons for orgasm without ejaculation (dry orgasm).- Retrograde ejaculation. This is when the semen is forced back down the penis into the bladder. This is usually a side effect of diabetes, certian medications, or trauma to the prostate. See a doctor immediately.- Any surgery to the prostate or bladder.The most common reason is either trauma to the penis or testicles. Swelling can close off the path for semen which causes no semen production. If it is painful when orgasm, see a urologist immediately because infertility is rare, but can occur.",
