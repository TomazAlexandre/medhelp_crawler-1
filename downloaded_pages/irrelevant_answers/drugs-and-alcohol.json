            "answer": "Dear diabetic 16,i am not a doctor and am just another diabetic helping out with mey experiences. Marihuana is not an acceptable drug to be using while diabetic as the euphoria may make you forget about keeping track of your diabetic responsibilities of your diabetes regimen. And the munchies created by marihuana would not be good for your diet. Alcohol is also not recommended especially because you are underage and the American Diabetes Association only recommends two drink per day for an adult male and one for a female. Hope this helps, bret",

            "answer": "There has been a lot of discussion about both of these issues on this Forum. Feel free to look back through postings to see what has been discussed.In a nutshell, marijuana is bad for diabetics because:1) It is illegal and you can end up arrested for drug use, which kills many future opportunities,2) Most users experience the munchies while high, and diabetics tend to find that their glucose levels rise when using marijuana because of this. If you cannot eat while thinking clearly enough to count your carbohydrates and take adequate insulin to cover them, you put yourself at risk of severe complications. As a volunteer for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, I cannot tell you how it breaks my heart when teenagers or young adults in their 20's write to us to tell us of their vision problems or neuropathy or gastroparesis that makes it impossible for them to eat without nausea. No temporary pleasure is worth risking this. None.As for alcohol, what the person who wrote the answer to your question wrote is true. In addition, drinking makes a diabetic more prone to dangers of severe hypoglycemia. This is because alcohol consumption causes the body to lose its ability to release emergency sugars stored in the liver to protect you some from hypoglycemia when glucose levels begin to drop. Alcohol use also will diminish your awareness of the symptoms of hypoglycemia so you may not know your glucose levels are dropping. And if you pass out while out with friends, their reaction will be to leave you to \"sleep it off\" not knowing that severe hypoglcyemia can kill you or do lasting brain damage.Again, both of these increase your risks. It seems that we who have dealt with type 1 diabetes in our youth and teen years (I am one of these, although middle-aged now) have a major job ahead of us just staying on top of those changing glucose levels. I personally decided when I was in my teens that I would never choose to do anything at all that would dim my ability to think clearly so that I could take care of myself. I would encourage you to think long and hard and to try to withstand the temptations offered by those two means of \"escape\". I frankly think that my life has been just as much fun with a clear head than it would have been if I had opted to ignore my medical needs and imbibe. I took sports as an outlet for fun and hung out with my friends and managed to never put myself in danger by doing drugs or alcohol. It takes real inner strength, self-control and a real deep sense of contentment with who you ARE -- you don't have to prove anything to anyone. I would challenge you to think this over and make the smart decision in order to protect yourself. Complications do not HAVE to happen to diabetics, for choices we make every day determine what our glucose levels will be.",

            "answer": "Hi i actually come from scotland not the US so the laws a bit different over here, i have been diabetic since i was about 10 and at the age of about 15 or 16 was introduced to smoking pot taking cocaine and ecstatsy and drinking (legal age to drink here is 18 and smoking tobacco is 16) since those teenage days i have grown up a bit and no longer take any of those things but remember from when i did that, when you are really high there is a good chance you won't be able to guage your blood sugar like you may normally be able to which is obviously not a good thing also smoking anything for diabetics is u big no no! the risk of high blood pressure aswell as the harm it does to your immune system can be devastating. The only advice i would give is that if you are going to be doing drugs or alcohol make sure that your friends know how to help you out should you have a hypo and also keep a blood glucose monitor handy because certain drugs will be cut with glucose etc that will mess around with your control. one last thing there has been research into insulin dependent diabetics being more susesptable to depression and i would certainly say that taking ANY drug will mess about with the levels of dopamine and serotonin in your brain making you more at risk of either depression or psychosis or other mental illness. take care.

            "answer": "Hi Diabetic 16,I was a rebelious teen when I was diagnosed, I am now 43 but I do remember drinking too much in college which led to several seizures due to insulin shock. Luckily I never suffered any severe injuries but the possibilty was too close for comfort. I do drink occasionally but I am acutely aware of how alcohol impacts my system and adjust my insulin accordingly. I am on an insulin pump and if I know I am going to drink have programmed specific patterns to adjust for this. It is really important to be pro-active rather than reactive. In adddition alwways have someone with you who is aware of your condition and how to help should you need it. If you choose not to drink I applaud you.all the bestCarolyn",
