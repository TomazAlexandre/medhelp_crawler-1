            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin that isn't accompanied by other obvious skin changes, such as a rash, is most often caused by dry skin (xerosis). Dry skin usually results from environmental factors that you can wholly or partially control. These include hot or cold weather with low humidity levels, long-term use of air conditioning or central heating, and washing or bathing too much.Other conditions cause itchy skin as well. Skin conditions like psoriasis,dermatitis,lice, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching.Pls take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch.Lastly,Phototherapy can also be tried.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",

    "question": "I have been experiencing itchy skin in my lower scalp, upper back and down my spine for about 10 months now. If I try to trace when it started, it was after staying with family who had a cat. I'm mildy allergic to cats, so of course I immediately thought it was ringworm or an allergy.\u00a0\u00a0This has not gone away for 10 months.\u00a0\u00a0I have seen a dermatologist, my regular physician, an allergist, and everyone has a different suggestion, but nothing works.\u00a0\u00a0I've tried cortisone creams, anti-fungal creams, even home remedies like alcohol, vinegar, calamine lotion, lemon.\u00a0\u00a0You name it, I've done it.\u00a0\u00a0There are no visible bumps unless I scratch, but even if I DON'T scratch, the itching is unbearable.\u00a0\u00a0Once I scratch, I get raised small bumps all over my back.\u00a0\u00a0I can't believe that no doctor has been able to acurately diagnose anything to get rid of my problem.\u00a0\u00a0I have not had an increased amount of stress (any more than before) in the last 10 months, and I have even changed to organic soaps, washes, shampoos, etc. after this problem occurred to see if it was an allergy to my hair products, bath gel, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I'm at wits end.\u00a0\u00a0To top it off, my daughter got lice during the summer, and I had put medication on everyone in the household.\u00a0\u00a0A month later when I went to see an allergist, he told me I had a couple of nits and this was most likely the cause of my rash and itch.\u00a0\u00a0Not so, because they were just dead (not taken out properly since I had to do it myself).\u00a0\u00a0I confirmed this after having my head checked professionally.\u00a0\u00a0So, after ointments, creams, antifungal liquids, I'm getting WORSE, not better.What can I possibly do?\u00a0\u00a0I'm ready to go seek alternative methods like herbalists, acupuncture, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have any suggestions?\u00a0\u00a0I've had it with doctors that can't help take this away.\u00a0\u00a0I never had this before!",
