            "answer": "Hi.Exactly what happens after you come around (after the episode)? Do you also experience this when you suddenly change your head direction?It is likely that you are experiencing postural (orthostatic) hypotension where the sudden change in position suddenly lowers your blood pressure thus leading to symptoms of dizziness or lightheadedness. Some causes of this condition include dehydration, cardiovascular disease, some medications, diabetes, and a few neurological diseases.It would be best for you to consult a physician to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms.Good luck.",
