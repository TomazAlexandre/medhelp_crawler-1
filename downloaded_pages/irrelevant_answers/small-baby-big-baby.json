    "question": "So my doctor told me that the size of the baby goes by how much you eat. I have 5 weeks to go and i seem to be eating more and more. Just wondering what everyone elses experiences have been? I really want a small baby. lol. Me and my partner were both under 6 pound but we were both early. Not sure if that has anything to do with it or not? I dont appear to be overly huge so hoping i dont get massive in the last couple weeks. Also praying i dont go over! I have put on almost 8kg so far.",
