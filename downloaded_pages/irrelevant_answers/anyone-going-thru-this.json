    "question": "i was put on metformin 2@500mg per day. my fasting insulin was normal but for fertility my doc would like to see it go down a little. my #'s when i check them are in the 80's, so they are good. my thing is that my stomach is upset and all the time and get tired of being in the bathroom all the time. told me that i will be on this all of the pregnancy when i do get pregnant. cant see how i'm going to be able to. anyways is there anyone that is kinda in the same boat as me? do you still take the met or did you quit? dont know what to do, dont know how much longer i can do this. the only reason i havent is bcuz i wanna get pg. told me will help with my blood sugars and balance everything out and dont want me to end of getting gestational diabetes when i get pg. i'm just frustrated because if i wasnt trying to have a baby then i wouldnt even be on this med, becuz i'm not diabetic. since i have been seeing the re i have been watching my carbs, sugars and starches. no more soda, sweet tea and frappacino drinks, miss them all. lol. if anyone can help or give me ideas or sugg that would be great... have a great day...",
