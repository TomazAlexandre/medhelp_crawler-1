            "answer": "It honestly doesn't taste THAT bad. Just make sure it's real cold that helped me. It kinda tastes like a melted orange freezie pop. It's not the best thing you'll ever drink, but it's really not too bad. At least I didn't think so, I didn't have at trouble getting it down or keeping it down. Though it did make me very jittery and I did feel like crap after words and didn't feel better until I got home and ate something and took a nap. Good luck!",

Its not supposed to taste good-its basically orange flavored humming bird food & the faster you get it in your system, the more accurate the test will be. Make sure you bring a healthy, high protein snack, like nuts or Greek yogurt, and a large amount of water to help balance your blood sugar after the test or it'll make you feel yucky all day! I've had to do this for my hypoglaucemia & it can make for a rough day if you don't getbyour sugar levels stabilized!",
