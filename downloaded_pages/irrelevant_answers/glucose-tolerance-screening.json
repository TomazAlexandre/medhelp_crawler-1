            "answer": "They draw blood after they make you ingest a glucose drink. It's only one hour and mrsp is right on with her suggestions. My appointments are typically at 5:30pm after work, but I made my glucose one for 8:30 in the morning so it won't be a problem to refrain from eating and my chances of passing aren't jeopardized.",

    "question": "I'm at 24 weeks (FTM) and go in for the glucose screening on Friday.I know they draw blood for this, right? How long does it take to get the results?I've never had a blood sugar problem in my life, but was overweight going into this pregnancy... That combined with the fact that my paternal grandma had gestational diabetes has me kind of freaking out about this (but no other fam history of it).Any thoughts or related personal experiences would be appreciated!",
