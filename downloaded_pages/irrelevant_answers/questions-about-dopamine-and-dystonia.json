            "answer": "First of all, keep in mind that I am unable to diagnose you because I am unable to examine you, this forum is for educational purposes.The symptoms that you describe are not specific for one disorder, but I can outline an approach to your condition.\u00a0\u00a0A dopamine responsive dystonia generally begins in the first decade of life with a gait disturbance (usually with toe walking) and progresses to involve all 4 limbs by the 2nd or third decade.\u00a0\u00a0The dystonia has a diurnal variation, with little to no symptoms in the morning, with worsening symptoms towards evening.\u00a0\u00a0As the disease progresses the dystonia can occur throughout the day.\u00a0\u00a0The most outstanding feature in dopamaine responsive dystonia (DRD) is that it responds dramatically to sinemet (levodopa/carbidopa).\u00a0\u00a0Many cases that present similiar to what you describe have a broad differential including cerebral palsy, leukodystrophy, Wilson's disease, Pantothenate Kinase associated neurodengeneration (PKAN), etc.\u00a0\u00a0An initial approach is often to give a trial of sinemet to see if the symptoms improve.\u00a0\u00a0I would also suggest some tests to evaluate for the other diseases that I mentioned including: MRI of the Brain (for cerebral palsy, leukodystrophy, PKAN), serum copper/ceruloplasmin (for Wilson's disease).\u00a0\u00a0I agree that you should see a movement disorder specialist that will be able diagnose you properly.\u00a0\u00a0As far as the long standing rash/yeast infection, I would suggest that you be screening for immunodeficiencies, some people are not able to defend well against certain organisms (a heme/onc doctor or infectious disease doctor may be more helpful with this).I hope this has been helpful.",

            "answer": "Hi sorry you have so many problems to deal with on top of no answers.\u00a0\u00a0One thing though the yeast infection can be a cause of diabetes or sometimes certain medications cause them, also certain foods, especially sweets and carbs can increase a chance of getting yeast infections and never getting rid of them.\u00a0\u00a0Has your GYN helped you at all.\u00a0\u00a0One time I had such a nasty yeast infection was there for months, one doctor put me on diflucan for a week though one dose is supposed to do it he gave me it for a week being I was never getting rid of it, at that time I made sure I ate plenty of plain yougurt (no sugar) no sweets and very little carbs it worked for me hoepfully it can for you too.\u00a0\u00a0That part might be helped if you can figure out what you eat a nutrionalsit might help with that.\u00a0\u00a0for the other symtoms I wish you luck in taking caring of yourself.",

            "answer": "Lol they aren't *vaginal* yeast infections.\u00a0\u00a0They are yeast infections in the skin rash, which occurs in several places on my body (under arms, on chest, a few spots on face).\u00a0\u00a0Every time I see a new doctor for whatever reasons, I always tell them about The Rash, hoping maybe someone, somewhere, will know what to do about it, but the most anyone has been able to do is give me oral antifungals, which work for a few months only.\u00a0\u00a0Steroid creams help it for a very small while, but I can't keep using them because the yeast sets in even worse from the dampness.\u00a0\u00a0I'm actually hoping that maybe a neuro might have an idea about what to do about The Rash since from what I've read, a lot of Parkinson's patients get it.\u00a0\u00a0So I'm hoping that maybe they've got more experience with it.I do not have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I have been tested 4 times, including during pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I simply don't have it.\u00a0\u00a0More than one doc has thought the same thing - diabetes often causes yeast infections - but nope, nothing but negative test after negative test.",

    "question": "31 year old wondering if this is descriptive of some sort of dystonia, possibly a dopamine-responsive one:1.\u00a0\u00a0Foot problems. Born with them. When learning how to walk, dragged one foot all the time. Have had flat feet, much pain, and spasms ever since. Spasms can pull the toes into weird positions. Can pull big toe outward. Little toes curl downward. Spasms happen only on action. Always walk on outside edges of feet now. Can put them flat, but hurts like you wouldn't believe.2.\u00a0\u00a0Pulse doesn't speed up enough when initiating exercise or when changing elevation. Have had many instances of passing out.3.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise intolerance. Causes exhaustion, increased muscle spasms.4.\u00a0\u00a0Muscle spasms happen anywhere in body now (recent change). Worse when sick, using certain drugs, or cold/hot.5.\u00a0\u00a0History of depression.6.\u00a0\u00a0Twitches, both skin and joint moving kind. Joint moving occurs in hands, feet, shoulders. Fingers accidentally tap buttons when resting over a mouse or keyboard. Twitches stop on voluntary movement.7.\u00a0\u00a0Slight trembling on occasion. Feel it more than see it.8.\u00a0\u00a012ish year old rash. Constant yeast infection. (please god someone explain that one) No history of diabetes. Have seen many docs about it but still have it.9.\u00a0\u00a0Speech problems. Forget syllables, slur, rush words, mumble.\u00a0\u00a0Seems slowly progressive.Strong history of familial tremor, just to add a dash of spice.Main doc getting me an appointment with movement specialist, but I am curious and of course *impatient*.\u00a0\u00a0Will likely be months before I see someone.\u00a0\u00a0Thx!",
