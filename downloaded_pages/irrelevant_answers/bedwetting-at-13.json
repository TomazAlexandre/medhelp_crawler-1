            "answer": "Hello.I know this really concerns you. Enuresis or bedwetting has both structural and psychological factors involved . With this in mind, may I ask when was the first time you experienced bedwetting? What were the circumtances that surrounded the first incident? Any problems at home, school or with relatonships ? Any changes in your life lately?Underlying disease conditions like diabetes, urinary tract infections, hormonal problems and genetics may play a role here. In your case, you have been diagnosed with repeated urinary tract infection in the past. Was the diagnosis made by your physician? At this point, the presence of the infection may cause the enuresis but it may also be the other way around.As there are two types of enuresis, the primary and the secondary. Primary enuresis is given as a diagnosis when underlying physical causes have been ruled out. This includes structural defects or abnormalities in the urinary tract. Secondary enuresis is due to an underlying disease process like an infection or diabetes. In your case ,you have been repeatedly diagnosed with UTI but your scans came out normal. Now, your physician needs to establish that the enuresis is not actually due to the underlying infections but may in fact cause the infections.Have you been assessed along this line?Discuss this with your parents or guardian so you may be guided accordingly. A referral to a therapist will also look into the psychological and emotional bases of your condition.I hope this answered your question and do please keep us posted for anything.i just have some questions :When have you first experineced bedwetting?What were the smptoms and",

            "answer": "Hi,Yes, bedwetting may lead to infections since this allows urine to dry in the area. At night, you may not wake up to wash and clean the genitals due to bedwetting. This may encourage bacterial growth and invasion. Urinary tract infections start in the urethra and these organisms will ascend and affect other parts of the urinary tract.As with diabetes, you are still young. Diabetes in most cases is acquired and affects the older age group. However, there is such a thing as type 1 or juvenile diabetes. Diabetes is diagnosed by taking your fasting blood sugar level.Are you currently assessed with your bedwetting? It is important that you always inform your parents or guardian for any concerns.It is good to know that you are fine emotionally. Just keep us posted for anything and we will see how we can help.",

            "answer": "Hi,We have to determine the underlying cause of the enuresis or bed wetting. If this is due to a structural or anatomic problem then the problem has to be fixed. Will you be bedwetting forever? I can not give you a definite answer since I really am not acquainted with your complete medical history and test results. However, there are several ways to manage and treat enuresis and it is important to know the definite cause of your condition. Treating the definite cause will treat the enuresis.Your physician is the best person to give you an answer for this. I hope things are better now. I know you are worried about this but do stay positive and get to learn more about this condition. Do not hesitate to ask your physician questions regarding anything which concerns you.",
