    "question": "My blood test results came back and my Lp-PLA2 level increased from 199 (optimal) to 308 (high risk).\u00a0\u00a0My hs-CRP level increased from <0.3 to 0.4, which still in the optimal range.\u00a0\u00a0my Apo B increased from 76 (intermediate risk) to 83 (high risk).\u00a0\u00a0LDL-P increased from 1010 to 1225 (intermediate risk).I have high LP(a) - 91, and LP(a)-P - 290 - but those did not increase and as I understand - are hereditary.Does anyone know why there would be such a big jump in the Lp-PLA2 number and small increase in the others?\u00a0\u00a0My other relevant numbers are total cholesterol - 191, LDL-C - 117.Thanks for any input!!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Juniper",
