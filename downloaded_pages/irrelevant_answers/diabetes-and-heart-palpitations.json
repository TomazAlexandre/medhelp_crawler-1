    "question": "I am a 46 year old male who has been experiencing an increase recently of palpitations. I was diagnosed a few years ago with Supraventricular Ectopic Episodes from wearing a holter monitor. I am diabetic type 2 and recently started on insulin for my blood sugars. I am wondering if there is some connection with being diabetic and having these heart episodes. I am wondering if anyone else experiences the same problem. I get anxious when I have these episodes and have presented at the emergency room a few times at night when heart palpitations have been really bad. I am on blood pressure medication and metropolol 25 mg twice a day but it slows the heartrate down but doesnt stop the palpitations",
