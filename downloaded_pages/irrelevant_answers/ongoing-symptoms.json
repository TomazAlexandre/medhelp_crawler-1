    "question": "I have been suffering since Oct 2007 with what I think might angina symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 46 year old mother of two daughters, living in the UK.\u00a0\u00a0I had my first experience in Oct 2007 whilst sitting at my desk at work.\u00a0\u00a0It started out as severe pain in my throat, which seemed to graduate up into my jawline and ears.\u00a0\u00a0I had pain/discomfort in my chest also, (akin to what I would describe as severe indigestion).\u00a0\u00a0The whole episode lasted 5-10 mins, leaving me feeling lightheaded & clammy (hands especially sweaty).I have had several episodes since this first event and was even admitted to Accident & Emergency, after I had an attack whilst sitting at home on the computer.\u00a0\u00a0They performed and ECG, which showed no abnormalities and all bloods were normal...??\u00a0\u00a0When admitted my blood pressure (taken on 3 counts) was 172/90.\u00a0\u00a0I still have fluctuating high blood pressure and also high cholesterol levels.\u00a0\u00a0Hypothyroidism is also another problem I have had for the last 13 years since becoming pregnant with my first child (6 months into pregnancy).\u00a0\u00a0I take 50mcg thyroxine each day.\u00a0\u00a0I have also been diagnosed with IGT, which can be a pre-curser to diabetes mellitus.\u00a0\u00a0I also had gestational diabetes during both my pregnancies (albeit never at very high levels).With all the above problems, I am obviously concerned that I might be showing signs of a cardiac problem.\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone out there advise me, or tell me if I'm barking up the wrong tree.Yours, Very concerned,JanineP",
