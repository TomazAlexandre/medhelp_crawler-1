            "answer": "There are 2 things that come to mind right off the bat -- first off, have you been checked for type I (juvenile) diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0That can cause weight loss and inability to gain.The second thing is hyperthyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0If your thyroid is over active, your metabolism will be speeded up to the point where everything you eat is used up very quickly, so there will be nothing for reserves.Both of these conditions can be very serious, but both are also easily confirmed/ruled out, with some simple blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0So I strongly recommend that you get tested.\u00a0\u00a0To test for diabetes, you will need fasting blood sugar, a hemoglobin A1c and probably a glucose tolerance test (that takes the longest).\u00a0\u00a0 To test for hyperthyroidism, you will need a TSH, Free T3 and Free T4 to begin with.",

            "answer": "thank you for your input, I've had a thyroid blood test done and it's normal, and my dr said I dont have type 1 or 2 diabetes and he never gave me a test for it, my mom has type 2. It's like I'm losing all the fat off my body but now from eatting like a pig I'm getting a gut. Always tired too. I have a whole list of symptoms and this started in january, I started searching the internet, big mistake, you should see the stuff that comes up on the computer, it scares the hell out of me",

    "question": "hi all, I'm having a problem with weight gain. I've always been a skinny person but since around the end of january I got sick and the doc told me it was a gastric virus since I went to that docs because of diarrhea and since then I still have not been feeling right. I've had a colonoscopy, endoscopy, you name it I've had it done, and everything is negative. My point is I'm eatting like a pig and either staying the same weight or losing a couple of pounds. I would just like some opinions about this. Thank you all",
