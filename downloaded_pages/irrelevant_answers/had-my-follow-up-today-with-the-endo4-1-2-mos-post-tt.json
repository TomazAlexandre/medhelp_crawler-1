            "answer": "Well, sometimes we just have to celebrate the \"small\" victories...you got her to test FT3!\u00a0\u00a0Congratulations!Your glucose levels are going to stabilize once you get your thyroid hormones back into line.\u00a0\u00a0You know how your glucose levels are affecting you much better than I do, but I'd be tempted to put that test off until you see what happens when your FT3 and FT4 are where they should be.\u00a0\u00a0#1 - Why have a diagnosis of \"diabetic\" on your records?\u00a0\u00a0#2 - What is the test really going to tell you (that you don't know already).\u00a0\u00a0However, this is just my opinion, so take it for what it's worth!September is quite a long time to wait before your next bloodwork since you are not yet on a stable dose.\u00a0\u00a0When my endo was increasing my meds, I saw him every 5-6 weeks and had bloodwork the week before seeing him.\u00a0\u00a0Are you getting close to optimum levels or just close to \"range\"?\u00a0\u00a0I'd probably try to push for a slightly more aggressive schedule.",

            "answer": "I agree with you in regard to the \"glucose level\"....this test is suppose to be the indicator of \"diabetes\" diagnosis...i'm quite sure that it is the same test i took when i was preganant with each of my girls....it's routine for pregnant woman. Now you have me thinking....hmmmmm. what if i do take this test and it shows me being a diabetic because of my thyroid levels, i'm assuming that she will put me on more \"pills\" , like i really need another pill! Besides, i explained to her that my levels are different everytime i take them with my home monitor and i've also read in one of my books that they changed the levels on that too..so whereas it used to be 120something as cut off, it is now 99...I also thought about the length inbetween labs as well.....but didn't say anything. Just to give you an idea...when my gp did the labs in march my Free T3 level was 247 range 230-420 and my Free T4 level was 1.0 range 08.1.8...now, the labs that my Endo did in april did not include Free T3 (of course) so i have no idea what that was..but my Free T4 level was 0.8\u00a0\u00a0range 0.8-1.8...and this is why she increased my med's..but itsn't that going backwards..??? My level should be rising and not dropping....My TSH in march was 16.29..range 0.40-4.50 and in april is was 8.90..same range (that has improved) and my antibodies were negative.I think i will push, especially if i do not see a huge increase in the way that i am feeling..I've come far from where i started but i feel as if i have a ways to go as well.",

            "answer": "Yeah, i thought the same but didn't open my mouth!...I guess she isn't one of them but i will probably be back there before then. I was wondering if she would add a T3 med, especially since my Free T3 level dropped instead of rising, but what do i know??Thanks",

            "answer": "Not only might you end up taking more pills, but you might also have a \"pre-existing condition\" on your records.\u00a0\u00a0I know that little loophole is supposed to be going away (pre-existing conditions), but I'm not convinced yet...Variable (unstable) levels are what you usually get with hypo, soooo...you seem to be on top of this and will seek further testing if anything changes.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime...Glucose levels have changed, cholesterol levels have changed...look at the profit for drug companies in all of that.\u00a0\u00a0It's frightening.It is going backwards to some extent...your FT4 should be rising.\u00a0\u00a0However, so many factors can influence it, not the least of which is that you're just 4 1/2 months post-TT.\u00a0\u00a0But, I think an increase was definitely in order.\u00a0\u00a0Could you just call the doctors office and \"reschedule\"...conveniently a couple of months earlier???\u00a0\u00a0That is too long between visits when your meds are being adjusted...fine once you get stable.\u00a0\u00a0It's just wasting time.\u00a0\u00a0You do have a ways to go, so why does she want to drag it out...too high a patient load?Your TSH is looking better...for what that's worth...you know what I think about TSH!Best of luck with your increase...push that doctor around a bit!!!",

            "answer": "Are you eating alot of processed carbs. and sugary foods. Getting your thyroid levels optimal for you will help with blood sugar issues but diet has made all the difference for my daughter. No bread, no cereal unless gluten free. As soon as I let my guard down, here comes the hunger! However, when we really watch her diet, the cravings and excess hunger disappear and her blood sugar seems to stabolize. When she was on Synthroid alone and her thyroid levels were unbalanced and I let her eat things that most kids want -Wow the hunger in her was so unnatural! Almost scary! The changes in her meds, levels, and food have made all the difference for her. She actually lost 2 lbs. at her last dr. visit. This was a miricle and all the evedence that I need that we are finally on the right track for her. I would focus on getting those t4 and t3 levels where they need to be and on diet before I'd ever let them label you as diabetic. Thyroid issues most definitly effect your blood sugar! Also, you need labs with Freet3 included every 6 weeks until you are stabolized! Insist!!!!",

            "answer": "A year before my surgery, i changed my diet and exercised regularly losing 30lbs...now, since the surgery..i had to gain my energy back enough to even think about exercising. That time came alittle over a month ago and i've been back in the gym ever since and also watching my sugar and salt intake, checking every level..etc, etc...so when i see that my glucose levels are climbing, and other issues as well, i know for a fact that it is more than likely due to the thyroid issues. My mom developed diabeties in her 50's, however she has never watched her diet, but i still may be proned to developing it as well..i don't know.\u00a0\u00a0 This will be a hard task to keep up with, but i'm gonna monitor every aspect of my health and if i have to fight with my doctors, i am willing to.

    "question": "I was excited when my endo willingly agreed with me after asking for her to \"also\" test my Free T3 along with the other's. Those of you who followed my posts can remember when i had to request the \"free\" testing from my primary care physician back in march because my Endo says that she will test them if i was not converting correctly. Well, i am converting correctly but my levels are still approaching normal and i am definitely having lots of hypo symptoms. She also increased my med's to 88mcg from 75mcg, so we will see how that goes as well.Beside the increased heart issues and now the high glucose, she wants me to have a 2hr uptake test to detect diabetes...well, i will pray that it's normal. I explained to her (endo), that i've gained so many issues after the TT and she says that the high Glucose level has nothing to do with the thyroid...I beg to differ! I guess it's just a coincidence??I go back to her in september after my thyroid blood work is done and we shall see what happens then.",
