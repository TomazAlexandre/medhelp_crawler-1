            "answer": "I would assume that basic tests were done to rule out diabetes and infection.A cystoscopy can be considered if there is suspicion of anatomical changes of the lower urinary tract.You can also consider urodynamic studies (i.e. cystometry, pressure flow studies etc.) to evaluate the pelvic floor and bladder/lower GU tract function. These set of tests are quite comprehensive and should be able to narrow down the diagnosis.These options can be discussed with your urologist.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Kevin, M.D.kevinmd_b",
