            "answer": "If you provide further details on your consultation with your doctor it would help narrow down what you need to do next. Under normal circumstances doctors do not \"mentioned like i am having diabetes.\" unless he/she has test results to back up their statement. Please answer the following questions in detail:1.) Did you or did you not undertake a glucose [blood sugar] tolerance test?1b.) A fasting glucose test?1c.) An A1c test?If yes to any of the above what were the test results? If you do not recall or do not have the results you can ask your doctor for lab copies. If residing in the USA it is your patient right to have copies of all your lab results. By seeing your test results we can determine where you stand.If no testing performed you need to contact your doctor and inquire why he/she feels your are \"having diabetes\". And, to clarify \"having\u00a0\u00a0diabetes\" you are classified as either normal, prediabetic, or diabetic [type 1, type 2, or type 1.5]. Telling us which one helps us help you so we can provide appropriate responses.",
