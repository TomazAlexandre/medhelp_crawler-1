            "answer": "Noy, do you have an interesting problem. It represents a lack of \"situational awareness\" as to the position of your head in reference to other objects. It is a very real problem, and could have a number of causes. Sometimes this goes away with age. It can be a symptom of concusion, diabetes, or hypoxia. It can be very frustrating. You don't have a psychiatric problem, if that helps. You need an A-number one general physical for starters.",

            "answer": "maybe concussion, not diabetes(i have had my blood sugar tested six months ago)and i don't know enough about hypoxia to really say(however that could explain some things. I have a really strong heart(doctors says it's efficiency is ridiculous)but i get out of breath faster than i should when training, but i can push on. especially in running(example i can run a 5K in 17:00 minutes roughly, but after two minutes i'm sucking wind bad. i just push on and then recover at race end). i have to do some research on that. i always thought it is because i am extremely hyper and move too fast(i bump my head once a months of so and usually not bad, but i have plenty of near misses that i catch at the last second and avoid injury)thanks for the info.",
