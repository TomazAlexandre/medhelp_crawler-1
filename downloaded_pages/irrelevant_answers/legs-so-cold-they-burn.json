            "answer": "I would suggest talking to a doctor about this asap. It sounds a little like the peripheral neuopathy my husband complains of. He has this due to a genetic disease that causes muscular degeneration (in a similar process to MD). So it's possible it's a symptoms of MS, even though it works through different means. It could also be a symptom of Diabetes type II- and if left unchecked that can be deadly. Another problem that can cause cold intolerance is a thyroid disorder. Talk to your doctor about getting your thyroid tested. Make sure you ask for Free T3 and T4 readings as well as the standard TSH, because they tend to be more accurate at what your thyroid is doing. Sooner better than later, just in case it is more serious. And if it's treatable or reversible, no reason to live in pain.In the mean time use good wool socks with nice insulation and maybe look into long johns. Once the temperature goes out my husband can't warm up his feet or calves himself, he has to have a electric blanket, a bath, or hot water bottle. Ugg boots work wonders because they're lined with very thick, very warm linings (and you can put a warming in there to help). They are expensive, but well worth it. Also, I don't know how bad the numbing is, but be careful walking barefoot because you can easily hurt yourself badly if you can't feel what you're feet are doing.Good luck and make sure you talk to your dr.",
