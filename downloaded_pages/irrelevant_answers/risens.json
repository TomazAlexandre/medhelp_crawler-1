            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Vaginal boils can be due to infection, STD or it can be a Bartholin cyst. Apart from the tests for this also get tested for diabetes and hypothyroidism. It can also be due to allergy to something like undergarment, soaps, lotions, tampons, sanitary pads etc.You can soak in a tub filled with a few inches of warm water (sitz bath) several times a day for three or four days. This may rupture cyst and which will then drain on its own. If this does not help, then please consult your gynecologist for incision and drainage.It can also be Hidradenitis suppurativa, which presents as recurrent boil-like pus-like discharge abscesses resulting in difficult-to-heal open wounds and scarring. It commonly occurs on apocrine sweat gland-bearing skin such as in the groin, the underarms and under the breasts. It is also known as \u2018acne inversa\u2019. Treatment is by topical antibiotics and steroids. The disease can spread to genitals. It can also be due to staphylococcal skin infections. Retenoid group of drugs also help. Wash skin with antiseptic lotions daily to decrease bacteria. Local antibiotics of erythromycin and Clindamycin group also help. Wear loose fitting clothes.Please consult your gynecologist regarding this and also get a STD panel done.Hope this helps Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
