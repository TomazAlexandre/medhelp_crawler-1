            "answer": "See if you can get Medicaid. If you search on line under health insurance there are policies you can get.\u00a0\u00a0Check with your state insurance department. Some states like NY have a non preexisting law which means you MUST be covered without a waiting period. The only way a new insurance cannot cover you is of you did not have coverage for 61 days.\u00a0\u00a0Contact your last job.\u00a0\u00a0By FEDERAL LAW they MUST offer you COBRA insurance. You musty pay for it but they have to offer it to you fro 18 months.\u00a0\u00a0I have attached an email address that answers questions, contact them they can help you with your former employer, they did for mehttp://www.cobrainsurance.com/COBRA_FAQ.htm#What%20Plans%20Are%20Not%20Subject%20to%20COBRA?http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/health-plans/cobra.htmHope this helps.

            "answer": "I'm another volunteer here and suggest that you visit the JDRF website (http://www.jdrf.org) and look for our sister-initiative Online Diabetes Support Team (ODST).\u00a0\u00a0Unlike us, their volunteers are equipped to work with individuals with information & support.I believe they have one volunteer who has become quite an expert on regulations & also resources available in different states.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, they may be able to connect you with others in your area that could help -- perhaps folks with leftover supplies after switching pumps, for example.If you decide to contact them, please mention that you were referred to ODST from the MedHelp/JDRF Forum.Good luck; as a fellow pumper I understand how frightening it is to face a potential lapse in supplies.\u00a0\u00a0Do be sure to keep plenty of syringes on hand & discuss with your doctor what insulin routine you should use just in case you need to take an unwelcome pump vacation.Good luck & hang in there.",

            "answer": "Some medication and supply companies have patient assitance programs, go to each individual site and apply directly, each company has their own rules and regulations, even if you think you do not qualify, apply any way, you never know. Also check with various charitable organizations in the community that may have funds or resources to give you assistance.\u00a0\u00a0Other meds, switch to generic--however you will not be able to do that with the insuline pump--most companys only manufature their own supplies and there are not generics.Let your needs be know to family, friends, church and clubs in which you belong.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure, most of them will not allow you to go without your supplies.\u00a0\u00a0Do plenty of websearches and just hang in there.\u00a0\u00a0I know it is tough.",

            "answer": "I am a business owner and at one time wanted my wife to quit her job to stay home with our newborn. Her job was providing insurance where as a single business owner I could not get any insurance with diabetes, besides from the state which is extremely expensive and your name is thrown into a pool - which is not good in my opinion. I learned a few things during those weeks so here area few pointers:1) check to see if you can get medicaid in the meantime2) call the pump manufacturer and tell them your situation. I know minimed offers financial aid and it is based off your income (and debts I think) - this will cut the supplies costs down.3) there are a few places online where you can ask for help from the World Wide Web - to fund you through these tough times. I have seen folks asking for assistance so a father could have back surgery or a child could get cancer treatment. So give it a try, I think it is free to create the \"fund\". http://fundable.org/4) as someone already mentioned, tell your church and friends your situation.5) doctors have lots of samples and give them out. The manufacturers give these graciously so don't be afraid to ask your doc6) I think the american diabetes society has some pages worth reading on how to get help when financially challenged. They may even be able to offer help in some tangiable way. I know when I called their toll free number the person on the other end was really helpful.7) for your prescriptions, think about buying them in Canada. Sorry folks, some of you may not agree but it is an option. You can buy some prescriptions online through a Canadian drug store. I don't even think you have to provide a prescription - less hassles there.I hope that helps.",
