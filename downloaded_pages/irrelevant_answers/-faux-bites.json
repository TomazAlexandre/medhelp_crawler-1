            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.The sensation you are feeling in your feet sounds like it is part of the peripheral neuropathy. People often describe biting, burning, stinging sensations.I am glad that you are having your daughter check your feet for you. One of the conditions associated with diabetes is prolonged would healing time. For this reason it is important for diabetics to take good care of their feet and check them often for any skin breakdown. If you can't see the bottoms of your feet, you can also try sitting in a chair and holding them out over a small mirror you place on the floor.You should speak with your doctor about the biting sensation. There are medications to help with the neuropathy. You can also help to resolve the neuropathy sensation by keeping you blood sugar under control at all times.Good luck. I hope this helps.Cathy",
