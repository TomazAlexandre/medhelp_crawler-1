My husband has many regrets over ignoring his, and is paying the price for it.\u00a0\u00a0I'd hate to see anyone else have to endure what he is right now.\u00a0\u00a0Wise up and get yourself healthy in every way, you only get one crack at this life, make the best of it!\u00a0\u00a0Take care.",

            "answer": "Not dealing with your diabetes can very well be making your depression worse.With proper treatment you should see improvement with your depression and your general health as well.As far as the other symptoms 'pins and needles, etc.' these could very well be the early signs of neuropathy which is very common in uncontrolled diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 I have severe polyneuropathy and believe me when I say that things will not get better from here.\u00a0\u00a0Pain 24/7 will make depression seem like a mere cold.\u00a0\u00a0You don't want to go down this road if you don't have to.I don't have diabetes but sure wish taking a pill or injection could solve my problems.Perhaps you should seek professional counseling to help you thru these tough times.",
