            "answer": "This won't be easy to follow, but if you go on Beachbody.com and look up Michi's ladder - it is a list of various foods broken into tiers, and follow it you will see results.

I took them for just one month lost 18 pds.It of course has side effects- different for everyone- it will cut your appetite down to nothing. i\u00a0\u00a0got off because I am dealing with depression. And felt like it was starting to make me crazy? This is not a good solution just a quicker way- if you try and start to make life changes it will give you a boost.
