            "answer": "Hi Superman22x!\u00a0\u00a0I am the mom of an 18 year old girl who was diagnosed at the age of 21 months.\u00a0\u00a0I am not a medical professional, so please review any info received here with your healthcare team first.Good for you for wanting to check out the insulin pump - it is a great alternative to shots and I am sure that once you're on it, the discomfort you experienced will not seem as bad and when you compare it to doing multiple injections a day, you'll be grateful that you made the change.My daughter has the Medtronic insulin pump and has had no problems with it and we are very happy with the company itself(well, there was the time that she went surfing with it on because nobody told us it wasn't waterproof!! - but Medtronic had a new one to us within 24 hours which was great).\u00a0\u00a0She's had hers for almost 4 years now.\u00a0\u00a0When asked, she says that the best part about being on the pump is being able to sleep in like all teenagers like to.\u00a0\u00a0She's able to do this bacause of the flexiblity in adjusting insulin dosage that the pump offers.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have any personal knowledge of other manufacturers pumps, but I am sure that the terrific folks who visit our site will be more than happy to share any experiences they may have with you (you can search the archives on this site for insulin pump & see what's been posted before if you want). I have not heard of the omnipod, but the feature of having the bg monitor and pump all in one sounds interesting.\u00a0\u00a0I'm just wondering what would happen if one failed for some reason if the other one would still function?\u00a0\u00a0You'd probably have to carry around a back-up monitor just in case (just like all pump users should have a syringe & insulin in the event of a pump failure - I know it's a pain, but if you've ever had to leave a dinner out with your family or leave a fun activity because you're having pump problems, you know that a little planning ahead can save you a lot of trouble in the long run).\u00a0\u00a0I don't want you to think that being on the pump is more of a hassle than being on shots because it isn't.\u00a0\u00a0The whole thing can be made very easy by a little planning ahead and having everything that you may possibly need with you.\u00a0\u00a0You should be doing this anyway no matter what your method of insulin delivery is.That brings up the other issue of where to put it all.\u00a0\u00a0I am assuming that you are a guy, because girls don't have this problem of carrying around the diabetes gear because they can use their purses - their only problem is that they can't use the teeny tiny purses that are sometimes in fashion!\u00a0\u00a0A guy needs to be a little more resourceful.\u00a0\u00a0Thankfully, carrying a backpack is a typical thing to see both boys & girls with these days.\u00a0\u00a0There are lots of pockets for your glucose source, snacks, bg monitor, insulin & syringes to go in.\u00a0\u00a0You could also invest in some sort of protected case that could hold all of your diabetes gear.\u00a0\u00a0Some of them are insulated against the heat if you're in a warm climate. There are many manufacturers for this type of case advertised in the Diabetes Forecast magazine and other healthcare magazines also.I hope I've helped in some way and good luck making your decision!\u00a0\u00a0Enjoy your pump!",
