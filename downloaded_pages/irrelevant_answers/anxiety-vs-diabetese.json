            "answer": "I would say that there could be a relation yes, at least theoretically, but an endocrinologist would be able to answer this question correctly. The endocrine(hormone) system is extremely complicated and for instance Cortisol ,which is a hormone associated with long term stress (which anxiety could be called) inhibits the uptake of glucose, insuline isn't working the way it should, thereby leaving too high levels of glucose in the blood and that is what is called insulin-resistance or a diabetes 2 condition. Cortisol is directly released from the adrenal glands by another hormone or\u00a0\u00a0chemical messenger called ACTH which is produced by the pituitary gland. This hormone has been syntesized from a \"mother\" hormone called CRH (corticotropin- releasing hormone)which is involved in the stress response. But there are several endocrine feedback systems that play their part in metabolism and linked to neurophyciology",
