I have taken two diflucan so far but don't want to take anymore while pg. They help for a few days then the pain and burn is back. Can't wait to deliver this baby.I would ask your doctor about taking diflucan for awhile and see if it helps. Just a thought.Huge hugs! I know how bad this sucks.",

    "question": "I am 47 years old and very active,not over weight, tested negative for diabetes. These infections began about 3 years ago and have gotten progressively worst.\u00a0\u00a0They seem to begin around the time of my monthly cycle and become very intense. Itchy, painful during sex, leaving a grayish discharge on my husbands penis.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have a foul oder or noticable discharge on my panties during the course of the day. I have been to the gyn who can't find anything wrong with me.\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible this is a sign of menopause? My cylcle is now every 22 days instead of 28 days. The only other signs of menopause are headaches occasionally. I have taken fluconazole which works after 3 days of severe painful burning and itching. Then the infection is back again next month.\u00a0\u00a0Over the counter medicines provide minor relief.\u00a0\u00a0What can I do to prevent this painful monthly cycle.\u00a0\u00a0Help!",
