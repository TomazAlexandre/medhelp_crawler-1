            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!It is difficult to diagnose on net based on symptoms alone. You could be having either one of these or a combination of these: viral fever (take your temperature and see), or urinary tract infection, or cervical spondylosis, high blood pressure, diabetes or even benign intracranial hypertension.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

I had one about 3 weeks ago.I have a severe headache on the half left side of my skull and ice helps me to ease it. I think MRI would give a better idea for what happens to you.Take care. If you have any solution for your problems plz share with me. I am really appreciate.",

            "answer": "Im not a medical proffesional,but should get checked for diabetes due to frequent urination and blurry vision/headaches! I am diabetic and so is my hubby.He has had all of these symptoms! Good luck...and even if it isnt try eating small meals spread out the day and see if you can get an over the counter sugar monitor and check your sugar during one of these \"attacks\". We also cut out most white foods and eat wheat instead...if it is diabetes there are lots of things u can do to improve the symptoms,other than and including medication if your doctor prescribes it.Exercise,eating right and making better choices in foods etc.Keep us updated and try to worry too much!",
