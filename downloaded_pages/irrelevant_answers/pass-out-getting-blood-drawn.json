I made the mistake of being really hungry on one blood test I had and ended up with my face in a sick bowl, shaking, sweating, couldn't hear anything but a high pitched ringing, it really was awful. I got a hot chocolate afterward and felt better.",

My fear stems from my appendix operation when i was 15 when the canular flew out of my vein when a student doc didnt secure it properly resulting in blood everywhere!! The midwife is very good and understanding of this now, tho she laughs at me cos i hold my breath every time which makes my veins hide so she has to calm me down and make me breathe lol",

I got mine done this morning and they took 3 viles and I got really light headed and dizzy and couldn't hear so I had to lay down :( ive had my blood drawn before no problem (besides being kinda scared) but nothing like today. i think part of it may have been anxiety induced? I psyched myself out really bad and I know I'm gonna have to get my blood drawn again, how do i not do that? kinda dumb question like \"dont think about it\" and I tried but I couldnt help it :(",
