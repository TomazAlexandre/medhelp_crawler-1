            "answer": "Hi there! Often times an overpowering sweet smell can be attributed to Diabetes. I would definitely recommend that he see his doctor and get tested. The test for Diabetes needs to be done by a doctor. The testing done while giving blood in all likelihood may not pick up any variances in blood sugar. There's really no way to tell what you are dealing with without talking to a doctor, and it's definitely a good idea to be safe rather than sorry. I hope that you both get this figured out. Good luck to you!",

    "question": "My son, early 40s, has a very strong, sweet smell when he sweats. He drinks a glass of wine occasionally, but has no problem with alcohol. This smell is over powering, to the point I almost gag when he is near. He donates blood every three months, so I'm sure if he were diabetic it would have shown up. Is there a medical condition associated with this? I am really quite worried.Thank you",
