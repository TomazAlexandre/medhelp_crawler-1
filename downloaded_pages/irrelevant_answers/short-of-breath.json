            "answer": "Hi honi certainly wish I could help you.You have been through the wringer with the surgery. I have your symptoms, been gettin worse for around 4 years now I am unable to do a few steps without breathlessness.I have pain now in my ribs and tum but I also have pains in my bones and muscles too, I am diagnosed with FM.I was diagnosed with GERD years ago I have been on all sorts since, they offered me surgery around 15 years ago, I wish I had taken it now. I think the nerves from the Gerd are referring signals to my lungs and interfere with the ANS and I get breathless because of it. I have no idea how to resolve this. If you find out something hon would you be good enough to message me?lotsa luvDawnx",

            "answer": "Wow, i just read about your shortness of breath! I feel like i finally have met someone just like me! I am always short of breath and have pains in my upper back! I feel like when i actually catch my breath i`m so relieved, but i know i will be trying to catch my breath again very soon! The doctors say my heart and lungs sound okay, but i`m going for some test very soon. The doctor has ordered every test for me under the sun, but i`m afraid no one is going to figure out what is wrong with me! I`m only 26 and i`m uncomfortable most the time cause i can`t breathe normally! I took the diet pill phentermine for several years, but have been off of it for a couple years. I`m afraid that that might be the cause of some lung and heart damage, but i just don`t know! Well, i wish you luck. Let me know if you have any suggestions for me! Thanks!",
