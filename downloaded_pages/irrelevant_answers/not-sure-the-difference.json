    "question": "My sister was diagnosed with hepatitis due to some activity to her liver. She knows it has something to do with her drinking, but she didn't know all the specifics. So, she came to me because she thought I could help her understand what is going on in her body. I don't have all the answers, so I am asking you, because I wouldn't feel quit right to talk to her doctor. She only knows that she has some type of hepatitis to her liver, and that it causes her some ailments. She wants to know what she is drinking that would cause this reaction to her.\u00a0\u00a0She also wants to know what kind of hepatitis it is. (A,B,C, or if there is a title.)\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know.. Thank You",
