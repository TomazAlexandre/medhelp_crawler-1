            "answer": "Hello boogie and welcome to the forums!What kind of medical history do you have? (ie: Hypertension on hypertension medication, diabetes, etc.)What an awful feeling with the shaky legs.\u00a0\u00a0Fortunately, you didn't fall over! Thank goodness!Weakness in your lower extremities and slight confusion would tell me either you're possibly having an episode of hypotension or possibly low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).\u00a0\u00a0It really depends on your medical history, medications you take (or don't take), and possibly other symptoms that you experienced this morning upon wakening.Please let me know and I will try to help you out, however, my suggestion is, is to go to your primary care physician and get checked.\u00a0\u00a0If this happens again, I would suggest to go to the ER.I'm not a doctor therefore I can't diagnose, but I am willing to help you along to get some possible answers for what you're going through.Please take care of yourself.Again, welcome to the forums.Lisa",

            "answer": "Hi there. This needs to be investigated in detail since shaky legs can be due to fatigue, over exertion, lumbar disc prolapsed or degeneration, trauma to legs, peripheral neuropathy due to vitamin B12 deficiency or diabetes, hypoglycemia, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and osteomalacia due to calcium and Vit D deficiency. Consult a physician to begin with who can assess these symptoms and rule out causes. Certain blood tests like electrolytes and blood sugar, MRI spine to check the disc and any bony spurs etc. hope this helps. Take care.",
