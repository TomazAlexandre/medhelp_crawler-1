            "answer": "Hi MACA,Are small arteries common?\u00a0\u00a0IF so, why have I not seen anything written about this in regards to angina?They are not common but we do see them.\u00a0\u00a0The usually host is a long standing diabetic or some one who is over weight with glucose intolerance.If I continue to lose weight will this help prevent the chest pain?It is possible that losing weight could help.\u00a0\u00a0You may have endothelial dysfunction -- this is a buzz word meaning that your endothelial cells do not secrete the vasodilators that they should, often related to diabetes or glucose intolerance.\u00a0\u00a0The only way to confirm this is to do a invasive pressure measurement during an angiogram.Are the medications I'm currently taking appropriate?If the beta blocker isn't helping, it may be worth trying a calcium channel blocker.\u00a0\u00a0It may help dilated the coronary arteries a bit better, but this is speculation.\u00a0\u00a0The only way to know for sure is to try it and see if it helps.What do I have to look forward to in regards to my cardiac care in the future?If the chest pains are from endothelial dysfunction, there are some diabetic medications that are speculated to improve endothelial function -- the so called TDZ class.\u00a0\u00a0A quick google search for TDZ and diabetes will explain more about this class.\u00a0\u00a0This is not considered a mainline therapy yet but trials are under way.\u00a0\u00a0It is unclear how much benefit it may provide.\u00a0\u00a0There is another metabolic syndrome medication coming out to help with weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0It is called rimonabant.\u00a0\u00a0It is a few years from release though.I hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Maca,I've been diagnosed w/ endothelial dysfunction due to microvascular disease after an invasive cardic cath w/ provocation. I had gestational diabetes x3, and am at risk for developing Type II.I exercise daily, avoid high carbs and sweets. I'm less symptomatic if I adhere to this regime. Increased blood flow due to moderate exercise is probably the most beneficial. If you're symptomatic when you exercise, try building stamina by slowly increasing your work-outs, perhaps in a gym if your doctor gives you the go-ahead.I take Lisinopril, Inspra and nitro-spray as needed. I rest when I feel very symptomatic, but then find the will to move on after the chest pain leaves. I try not to let the disease get the best of me, but am smart enough to recognize when it's time to seek medical care.Below's some info on the benefits of taking Inspra, which is an aldosterone blocker. Ask your cardio about its benefits in relation to small vessel disease caused by glucose intolerance or diabetes. Studies are on-going, but the combo of the ACE and Inspra has helped me.Best,CAldosterone, a steroid hormone produced in the outer layer of the adrenal cortex, promotes renal sodium retention and potassium loss. Secretion changes occur in response to alterations of volume status or salt intake mediated by angiotensin II. Aldosterone reduces baroreflex sensitivity and enhances sympathetic activity resulting in reduced nitric oxide",

            "answer": "I guess that I am still a little confused as to why I have the small arteries and why they cause the chest pain. I am not a diabetic and haven't shown any tendency to glucose intollerance. I do exercise as much as possible, I walk 1/2 mile during my breaks at work (morning and afternoon) depending on the weather. I also swim laps 2-4 times per week. When I do have the chest pain I rest for while then go right back to my exercise.",

            "answer": "Maca,I am not a doctor, remember that.Small vessels could be an artifact, i.e., characteristic of who you are, reflecting your genes, etc. It also could be reflective of \"female pattern heart disease\" where the arteries narrow diffusely. The lesions of typical CAD cause a more focal type of stenosis.Endothelial dysfunction means that the inner layer of the arteries constrict or don't dilate normally, causing a coronary flow deficit which can result in angina.There are many risk factors for heart disease, diabetes is only one of them. I'm sure you've read about metabolic syndrome, for example. Or inheritance. My mother has CAD. At the end of the day, even my doc can only theorize as to what triggered microvascular disease.I hope this helps.",

I have chronic pericarditis about 2 years, and it gets worse if I exercise and I have had stress because of it about last six months. I have medication now but it seem not work very well. I am very frustrated.I think you don't have the same disease, but I write here because there could be many reasons for your symptoms. I hope all best for You!!!",

            "answer": "TerryC.\u00a0\u00a0I too have pericarditis. It is going on or about 7 weeks. I took naproxen for six days, which rid me of the pain. However, after I stopped it ,because it made me sick, the pain returned and I am now on Lopressor. Lopressor does not help to rid the pain and I am frustated. I cannot do normal activities, like walking without having pain.\u00a0\u00a0I am so upset. I feel like a cripple. I must now either change doctors or get on another anti-inflamatory medication. Terry, I can understand your frustation. What medicines did you take for pericarditis? Did any of them work even temporarily? Do you know what caused your pericarditis?",

            "answer": "Hi! At first doctors only wait and see if my pericarditis would go away by itself. Well it didn't!Then they\u00a0\u00a0give me some anti-inflammatory drug for some weeks. I can't remember the name right now, sorry. It heped some time but the symptoms, especially pain, came back.Then I get Prednisone for two-three months. It helped also but that drug has some nasty side-effects so my doctors recommend to stop it. It was a big releaf to get rid of the pain for some time, but the pain came back after stopping this medication.Now I have colchicine. It helps me if I don't exhaust myself. I can now for example walk quite normally but not run. My cardiologist said that I have to take this medication at least a year.I am sometimes quite frustrated and that's why I wrote to this forum. Thank You very much Angie for your concern:) I recommend that try colchicine or colchicine and anti-inflamatory medication together. Ask it from your doctor.My pericarditis is idiopathic so the doctors don't know what is causing it. It is also recurrent.There are some good writings in medhelp archive about recurrent pericarditis if you are interested. I think there is more opinions about colchicine.",

Perhaps I exercised too heavy too early and it came back? Now I take colchicin 2x0,5mg per day. It is a common drug to this disease. Have you tried it or Prednisone, a corticosteroid?

My cardio gave me an echo stress test and he rather confusingly expained that I had pericarditis.\u00a0\u00a0Actually, I had just had an angiogram 4 days prior to the onset of the pain, by another doctor in the same office.\u00a0\u00a0I am very sorry that I had the angiogram. It wasn't a necessity.I should have gotten a second opinion about getting the angiogram.I am now 61. I think my angiogram stirred up a pain that I use to get rarely\u00a0\u00a0about 30 years ago. Now I have that\u00a0\u00a0pain off and on most days.I was pain free for part of today.\u00a0\u00a0However, aftersitting on the floor and lifting\u00a0\u00a0a\u00a0\u00a05 lb dumbell with my left hand,the pain\u00a0\u00a0returned. Took a tylenol and the pain disappeared for about three hours.Terry, did you\u00a0\u00a0run or jog, prior to your pericarditis? Can you exercise at all?I am finding it difficult to walk at a normal pace, now since my angiogram. I hope there is some opportunity for improvement of our conditions, through some kind of slow and careful physical exercise conditioning. Has anything in the two years worked at all for you?To el_scorchito...It is a good sign that tests are negative and that you can mostly exercise pain free.\u00a0\u00a0Count your blessings, keep asking questions, educate yourself\u00a0\u00a0and hope the pain is skeletal while you pursue a healthy low fat diet and a suitable daily exercise program. Fear of the unknown is a scary. Forums like this are very helpful. Get second opinions.",

            "answer": "Hi Terry. Sorry for the delay. i've been sidelined with a broken hand.I'm now into week 10 of pericarditis.My cardiologist doesn't know what caused my pericarditis. I am guessing a rowing-crewing class or complications from an angiogram. Cardiologist first prescribed Naproxen 500 which he said reduced my inflamation. I had to stop Naproxen after about 6 days because of side effects. Then cardiologist gave me lopressor .25. The pain and palpitations almost completely subsided. When I broke my hand, I took a pain killer that was similar to lopressos's lowering blood pressure. So I stopped taking lopressor. Now I am lopressor free and pain killer free. My pericarditis pain is almost gone. I have\u00a0\u00a0to pace myself and my emotional stress, which will bring back cardio pain.I,too, use to exercise alot. Walking up hills caused NO pain before I contracted pericarditis. Now, atleast I can walk flat 1 and 1/2 miles a day pain free. I am gradually gettin better.My cardiologist said, soon as this pericarditis gets under control, he will look into my 10 year \"long-standing problem\" of fast heart-rate and chest pressure that I experience in the early morning hours.Terry, thanks for your advice.I hope you too are getting better.Keep me informed.

There is some left, but this is good news for me because now I know that my medication works somehow. Perhaps my sac don't need surgery.I have to take colchisine + anti-inflammatory daily, but if those drugs help me I take them gladly.

    "question": "I have been having chest pain off and on for 2 years with exercise or stress. A couple of months ago it began to happen more often and became more severe and occur at anytime. I am a female, 51 yrs. old and overweight (but I have lost 30 pounds and I still working on it). I also had a complete hysterectomy in 2001 and am not taking any HCT. My doctor put me on Metoprolo 25 mg bid and I am taking Benzepril/HCTZ 10mg/12.5 one per day, ASA 325 and Nitro prn.\u00a0\u00a0Last year I had a positive stress test and in 6/05 I had a angiogram which showed normal except for genetically extremely small coronary arteries. the cardiologist instructed me to followup with my primary doctor, continue my medications and continue to lose weight and maintain my blood pressure as low as possible. The nitro does help to relieve the pain and I take it sometimes 2-3 days per week. My resting BP at home ranges from 106/60 to as low as 77/42, but at the doctor's office I am more stressed and it is around 130/77.My questions are: Are small arteries common? If so, why have I not seen anything written about this in regards to angina? If I continue to lose weight will this help prevent the chest pain? Are the medications I'm currently taking appropriate? What do I have to look forward to in regards to my cardiac care in the future?Thank you for your time in answering my questions as I have been trying to post these for some time.",
