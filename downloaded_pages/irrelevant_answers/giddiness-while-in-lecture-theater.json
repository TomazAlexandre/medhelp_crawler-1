            "answer": "Hello,To be honest, this sounds like a pinched nerve issue in your neck, try seeing a chiropractor, after a few adjustments in your neck, you should feel better.Another cause could be you need your eyes checked. Sometimes when our vision is not as good as it should be, we can have these issues.",

            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for your reply, I think I should get both things done.Also, I get this knuckle sound in my neck, growing up since few months, like the knuckle sound in the fingers. So whenever I suddenly change my neck or when i ride my motorbike and there is a sudden hump in the road then I get this knuckle sound in my neck. So I wonder could that be a cause also of my giddiness in lectures. Its almost certain that whenever I attend a lecture in a well/hall I would certainly get this giddiness. Should I see a neurologist?Many thanks in advance!sanjeev",

    "question": "Hi,Am observing since past few weeks that while am listening to a lecture in a lecture theater, I would suddenly get a giddiness that is for a moment, then it again comes back. Such episode remains till I walk out. This condition happens only when am listening to a lecture in a stepped hall, where there is floor elevation and not in flat floors.Am kind of worried on this symptom, let me know any help. Am perfectly ok otherwise, no diabetes, or any other ailment.",
