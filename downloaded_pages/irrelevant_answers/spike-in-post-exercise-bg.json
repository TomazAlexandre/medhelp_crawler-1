            "answer": "Not sure how to answer the 102 to 1 hr 202 elevation. During strenuous/aggressive exercise your body releases adrenaline which in turn causes your muscles and liver to release stored glucose [BG]. Have you tested at 1.5 and 2 hr intervals? It may take that long for your body to come to rest/normalized, it does mine. If it persists call your Endo.",

    "question": "I started an aggressive walking program a few months ago. Lately, I have noticed that at times my BG reading post exercise is normal, but an hour later it spikes up. For example, pre-walk BG was 90, post-walk BG was 102, 60 minutes later BG was 202! I freaked out, took a glipizide (which I rarely use anymore), and watched my BG go down rapidly to 100 within the hour. Why does this happen? How do I manage pre/post exercise?",
