            "answer": "It sounds to me like (don't laugh) a yeast infection, yes both women and men can get this. It probably developed because of the antibiotics\u00a0\u00a0that you were taking. Are you Diabetic?\u00a0\u00a0just asking because Diabetics tend to get these infections very easily. It is very treatable, if that's what it is you need to get an antifungle cream by the doctor, for it to go away. Good luck",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!It is difficult to diagnose a rash on net. This could be an eczema, dermatitis, sweat dermatitis, fungal infection, infection with stool, poor hygiene causing infection. If you have diabetes then this needs to be investigated as it can result in skin problems. After a course of antibiotics also it is possible to get both bacterial and fungal infection of skin. However it cannot be an allergic reaction to the antibiotic as that would be more general. Correct treatment will depend on diagnosis, for which you will need to consult a skin specialist.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
