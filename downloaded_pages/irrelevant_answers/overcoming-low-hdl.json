            "answer": "Erik,Thanks for the post.With the information that you have provided, you do not meet criteria to initiate drug therapy for your cholesterol profile.\u00a0\u00a0The National Cholesterol Education Program recently released the ATP III (http://hin.nhlbi.nih.gov/ncep.htm), which discusses LDL and HDL goals.I cannot say that what you are doing is either \"prudent\" or imprudent, but it is an aggressive therapy program, and one not currently endorsed by the medical guidelines.The low LDL does lower your risk for coronary artery disease, but I cannot say if this low level of LDL completely offsets the pro-CAD effect of the low HDL.I have not heard when a CETP inhibitor may be released, but I think we may expect to see one on the market within the next two years provided that the studies support their release.Hope that helps.",

I have high cholesterol for many years now, I'm also on 10mg Zocor. My HDL is 72, nice high number, but also all my other numbers are high. Total 233, LDL 125 Trig. 264.Laura",

            "answer": "I suggest you get checked out for diabetes. Diabetes and pre-diabetes and insulin resistance are associated with high triglycerides and low HDL. These changes often show up before the pancreas has been damaged enough to cause diabetes (or possibly even before the pancreas has been damaged at all)- so it might be an early enough warning to stop type 2 diabetes from occurring.Once diabetic, always diabetic, and once you hit that point, damage (to the pancreas and the rest of the body) occurs inevitably, even with PERFECT glucose control (which you won't be able to maintain, as more and more beta cells die).Stop diabetes before it attacks. Exercise (with medical permission).Diabetes is worse than heart disease in my opinion. It kills you bit by agonizing bit. And it is relentless. I've seen it firsthand (thankfully I personally have avoided it).I'd take dying from VFib before dying from diabetes any day.",

            "answer": "Familial HDL deficiency is a ***** and a killer.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure that there will be a one shot genetic treatment in 10 years, but it would cost the drug industry about 50 billion a year so I don't think they will rush it.The three current things proven to raise HDL are exercise, alcohol, and high dose Niacin.When I had my heart attack 4 years ago my TC was 220 and my HDL was 29.Now thanks to a combination of Lipitor + Welchol + Niaspan my TC has been between 110 and 131 over the last year.\u00a0\u00a0Problem is that my HDL was only 38 six months ago.\u00a0\u00a0Fortunately it had moved up to 45 on my last test, I think mainly due to Niaspan + exercise.Your readings are quite good otherwise, except maybe triglycerides are a bit high, and it would be quite hard to have high HDL with those low overall readings, but you should be able to obtain 45.You said that you couldn't tolerate Niacin, but have you tried Niaspan?\u00a0\u00a0I take it on an empty stomach at bedtime -- no low fat snack like they recommend -- that's bogus advice.\u00a0\u00a0I never have a problem unless I eat too close to bedtime - then I might experience flushing.\u00a0\u00a0The pill itself is so highly buffered that it shouldn't cause any irritation to the stomach.Also I try to walk uphill about 5,000 feet per week during the summertime and a bit less during the winter.\u00a0\u00a0Fortunately I live in the mountains, but even 15 minutes of walking uphill a day really makes a difference.Good Luck.",

            "answer": "If I were you, I would ask the doctor for a Niaspan script.\u00a0\u00a0I think that you could take it without a problem on an empty stomach at bedtime.\u00a0\u00a0That and daily exercise would be about the best thing that you could do for your HDL.I think that the triglycerides are a bit high for the total cholesterol levels that you are showing.\u00a0\u00a0The standard is anything below 150 being acceptable, but I would think that you shouldb be down around 100 with that TC.Of course I'm not an expert, just someone trying to save myself from advanced coronary artery disease.Regards",

    "question": "Dear Doctor:I am a 34 year old male in good health other than benign PVC's and a 4 hour episode of A-Fib that happened two years ago. It was due to daily consumption of two glasses of red wine that lowered my magnesium levels. No more episodes since quitting drinking and taking Magnesium oxide. However, I was drinking the red wine to raise HDL as it was in the 24-33 range.My doctor and I have devised a plan to keep my LDL and total cholesterol as low as possible as to keep my ratio of Total cholesterol to HDL as low as possible. I am unable to take Niacin as I have severe acid reflux and cannot tolerate it. I take 20 mg of Zocor a day, exercise 40 minutes a day six days a week and drink 12 ounces of Welch's purple grape juice a day. My most recent Lipid profile is as follows:Total Cholesterol-116Triglycerides-126LDL-61HDL-32Ratio-3.6My question is do you think I am doing the prudent thing considering my circumstances? Am I at a decreased risk of CAD since my low LDL makes up for my low HDL. I figure I can follow this program until they approve an HDL elevating drug. Also, do you know when those new CETP Inhibitors should be on the market?Thanks for your time.Sincerely,Erik",
