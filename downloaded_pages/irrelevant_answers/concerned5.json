            "answer": "For me, the treatment wasn't a great experience, but I would do it again. At 16 weeks the virus is undetected. TX for 24 weeks. I am genotype 3 and treated with Peg and Riba. Got anemia and reduced riba to 600 from 1200 daily and it seems to have worked. I have trouble breathing and am dizzy a lot. Received 3 transfusions as my hemo dropped below 8 and it was 6.3 too. Worked 2 jobs but it is hard. Went to bed as soon as I got home and slept all weekend. Took shot on Friday and by Mondays I was able to function a bit better. My hair is falling out now and is really thin. I had a thick head of hair. From reading this forum, I realize that we all have different symptoms but if you can get rid of hep c, your life will change. I know its a hard decision but read the forum and decide what is best for you. All the best!",

            "answer": "Firstly, welcome to the forum.\"My question is how bad do the treatments make you feel.\"How long is a piece of string? For some people, they are able to work through treatment, for others it can be quite debilitating.It can depend on what genotype you are and what treatment options are available, length of treatment etc., age, health of liver, general diet etc.\"I don't know if I should do them because of the health problems I already have.\u00a0\u00a0I am a diabetic and have thyroid problems\"Many people have diabetes and treat successfully, but as I don't have any knowledge on this matter, some one else here in this forum will comment. Thyroids can be affected by HCV, and consequently, also treatment. Your specialist should be aware of all your health conditions before you start treatment, and monitor you through this. I have hypothyroidism and have managed my condition for more than 10 years on medication, but during the last year on treatment, it swung quite a bit and we had to keep testing and watching and adjusting my thyroid meds. A good specialist will keep an eye on all of this.\"Should I be concerned or just go ahead and start them??? \"To get a more thorough response to these questions, you will need to find out what genotype you are, what your iL28 genetic marker is, have a fibroscan or equivalent to find out the state of your liver, what fibrosis there is (if any), and then, only then, will you have information that will tell you, your doctors and us, what treatment is available, how quickly you may need to treat, or as you are in the US, new meds have been approved with are Interferon free, and only for 12 weeks, not like the 48 weeks that some of us have done.your odds of clearing the virus, depending on what strain of HCV you have, may have gone from 50% to over 95%-100%.You are young. Good time to treat. new meds. Shorter treatment times. Perhaps no Interferon. The older you get, the harder it seems to be on your body.Good luck and keep in contact. there are some very clued up people here. None of us are doctors, but most of us have treated, are treating, or waiting to treat.",
