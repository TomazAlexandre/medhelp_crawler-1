            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.It is great that you are being proactive with your diagnosis. You want to make sure to limit the amour of carbohydrate you consume, as that is what will raise you blood sugar. The American Diabetes Association has meal plans available at no charge on their web site. This could be a good starting point for the changes you need to make. Another resource is your doctor, who should be able to provide you with carb, and calorie intake parameters tailored to you. You will also have to check you blood sugar to see how the foods you eat are affecting you. Everyone responds differently, so a meal that may be fine for one person, could raise the blood sugar of another. You are going to have to get to know how your body responds and tailor you eating habits accordingly.I hope this helps.Cathy",
