            "answer": "Hi Donuci,How are you feeling?What you are experiencing is neuropathy symptoms.Pain, tingling and numbness are signs of neuropathy. Nerve involvement may be single (mono-neuropathy) or multiple (poly-neuropathy).Do you have color change at the site of pain on exposure to warm and cold sensations?This neuropathy can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.You should be doing HbA1C, ESR, serum protein/immuno-electrophoresis, and vitamin B12, BUN, and creatinine levels.In your case it might be due to altered blood pressure status.Arterial hypertension can cause abnormal blood supply to different parts of body causing vascular compromise and further causing tissue injury and hypoxia.I think you should be seeing a neurologist and physician at earliest to discuss regarding further plan of management and imaging study to rule out any intra-cranial pathology.Keep me informed if you have any queries.Bye.",
