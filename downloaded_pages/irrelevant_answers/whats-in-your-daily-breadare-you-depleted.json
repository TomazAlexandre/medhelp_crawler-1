            "answer": "Amen!Our bodies in harmony makes a good seat of our mind and health. A lot depends on what we eat - much more than we think of.Just recently it dawned on me that if I gave my daughter cereal in the morning, she'd continue to be grumpy until the next meal. The solution was to try out something else: She got milk and sandwiches and it has done revolutions in our home!Too much of anything isn't good at all but it is crystal clear that reasonable amounts of all that the food pyramide lists certainly gives a lot of what we need. If a supplement should make you feel better, then take it.My daily bread includes Omega 3 (I don't eat enough fish), a multivitamin and a magnesium pill now and then for muscle cramps. If I get too much magnesium though, my kidneys get too much to work on. With a normal kidney function it's not harmful with Mg as supplement, but if you take it in excess, your body responds with diarrhea.My father had a heart attack a year or two ago - it was merely a warning though with pressure over his chest and arrhythmia, but it was a serious scare. They did suspect a lot, and found out he had diabetes. They added magnesium in addition to giving him dietary suggestions for the diabetes and after 4 weeks, he was on a normal heartbeat again. Both the changes in his diet did help him.Florena",

    "question": "Do you really ever consider the importance of diet and nutrition upon your health? I am not talking about weight loss either, for I am sure that most of us know all about the importance of keeping a healthy weight. But, being heavy does not mean that other health problems should be overlooked just because of weight. I had to say this because of personal reasons.Most of us, in the West especially are used to the overly processed food approach and rarely include vegetables and fruits into our daily diet. Not only that, but many of us don't think to add whole grains of varying sources as well as differing types of legumes, nuts and seeds. These are all very important as well. Personally, I believe that more people suffer from a lack of proper nutrition in the United States especially. Many people who are too busy to bother fixing a proper meal, eat on the run or indulge in fast food. Also, many people take medications or have an illness which may in fact deplete or cause a problem with the absorption of important nutrients in our bodies.Do you love eating white bread? Is every type of bread or pasta you buy enriched, but not made of whole grain flour? Have you ever taken the time to read the nutrients and ingredients on the packages of the foods you buy? There have been news shows dedicated to certain populations of individuals who now suffer from Type II diabetes because of the lack of proper diet in the United States. How many of us feel sick and do not know why? How many of us go to the doctor and are told to lose weight and you will feel better, but we know that is not all that is wrong?Here are some things I urge you to consider. If you rarely eat full rounded meals, or are not taking supplementation to replace what you may be losing in your daily life, then maybe it is time to start considering what foods and nutrients need to be added to your Daily Bread. I can pray for my Daily bread to be provided, but the original breads made years ago by early settlers and the kinds made in other countries where things are not so processed, are much more healthy that what we buy today. Also, some people cannot have gluten due to Celiac disease. So in a literal sense, what is in Their Daily Bread can be a matter of life and death.When I think about nutrition and illness, only a few main things come to mind aside from avoiding simple sugars...\u201dPotassium, Calcium, and Magnesium\u201d. I am not going to go into great detail, but I assure you that being someone who only took FlintStone Vitamins as a kid and always had shirked supplements, that I would not normally even care to bother writing anything about this. I have been sick and do not have all the answers I need, but I also have met others like me who have found simple answers to help relieve symptoms if nothing else. A lady I met while in the ER, was telling me how she had suffered from leg cramps for years, and her daughter who had been a doctor for awhile suggested that she try Potassium. She told me this completely got rid of her leg cramps. Also, there are rare kidney disorders that cause potassium and magnesium levels as well as other electrolytes to go haywire. Two such disorders are Bartter's and Gitelman's syndrome. These are very uncommon, but even Diabetes can cause problems with depletion of important nutrients in the body.It does not stop here. Many of us do not even stay hydrated or cannot stay hydrated because of illness or medication. Some of us may eat too much salt, or too much calcium, and such things can also cause an electrolyte imbalance.These things are usually detectable with blood tests, but not everyone has such problems or the resources to get these things checked out. Also, making simple changes is sometimes all that is necessary. However, magnesium depletion or deficiencies are not so easily detectable by just the standard serum blood test for Magnesium level. How do I know this...my doctor said so. Magnesium is more concentrated in the bone and on an intracellular level. So doctors, please don't just depend on a serum magnesium level to help your patients.Magnesium is more important that I ever could even have thought it was. When I do not take it, I can hardly function anymore. I get twitches, cramping, restless legs and arms, you name it. I remembered that only on a few occasions years ago it had been low along with my potassium, and desperate for answers I started taking it and years of what I thought might be some horrible neurological disorder, turned out to somehow elusively be related to not having enough magnesium in my system. However, my battle is not over and I do not know why this is the case, but at least I get some relief if nothing else.In conclusion, I would like to say this is based upon my own personal experience and the people I have met, and through suffering in general. I am just a patient who wants help, but also if nothing else would like to help out even one person to not have to suffer as I have.So What is in your Daily Bread?",
