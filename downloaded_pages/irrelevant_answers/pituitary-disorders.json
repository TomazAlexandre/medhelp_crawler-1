            "answer": "It would have been better to start a new thread but... why are they not treating him for the high prolactin? Is he on dostinex or parlodel?The pituitary tumor would impact his personality - it needs to be treated. A neuro-endo is better so glad you are going that route. Once you have a pit tumor, TSH is usually invalid - often it drops so it seems he may also have a thyroid issue. T4 I find is rather useless. I like free T3 and Free T4 as they reflect what the thyroid is doing. TSH is a pituitary test, not really a thyroid test. Any antibodies on his thyroid at all?I had a prolactinoma, as well as thyroid issues and other hormone issues - it will take a good doctor to get it figured out.",

Your pituitary may be gone but now\u00a0\u00a0you have probably empty sella syndrome.I am panhypopituitary too, and I lost my career of 25 years...Make sure you have a good neuro-endo to monitor you - you may need changes to your hormones over time.",
