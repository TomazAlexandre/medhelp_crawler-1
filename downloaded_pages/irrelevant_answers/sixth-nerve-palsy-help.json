            "answer": "I am a 42 year male who served in Desert Shield/Storm, in which back then I was given a pre-nerve agent treatment tablet to take every eight hours. Now I am a police officer for the past 14 years. I recently experienced double vision while driving to work.The prior day, I felled off a treadmill hard on my right shoulder running on the top speed, however, I had left eye pain approximately five days prior to the fall. And approximately a month before the left eye pain,\u00a0\u00a0I had left ear pain due to a work related injury: My portable radio ear microphone went off loud in my left ear. I do not know if these things are related to my 6th Cranial Nerve Palsy.During the initial onset of symptoms (double vision), I was at work for one and half hours before realizing I needed to go to the emergency room on November 18, 2009. The CT Scan and my ocular pressure at the hospital were normal. The physician referred me to an eye doctor after diagnosing me with diplopia .The next day on November 19, 2009, I was examined by an eye doctor who referred me immediately to a neurologist. I had to wait the next three days to be examined by the neurologist who diagnosed me with 6th Cranial Nerve Palsy in my left eye on November 23, 2009. I showed the neurologist my blood test results from a complete physical done back in May of 2009. Glucose levels were normal, but my cholesterol was high: 292; then blood fasting 242. The neurologist ordered an MRI, which was completed the next day on November 24, 2009. After the MRI (same day) I went back to the neurologist who stated everything was normal. He ordered 12 hour fasting and a two hour glucose test, CBC, ANA, etc..After leaving the doctor's office, I went to the health department for a HIV & TB Test, which were both negative. The neurologist's ordered blood work was completed the next day on November the 25, 2009: The results are pending. Also, he ordered a lumbar puncture scheduled for December 7, 2009. My next appointment with the neurologist is December 11, 2009. I am worried of the cause and prognosis of my illness, although, the neurologist is saying it should resolve itself in the next two months.I have been healthy most of my life and love to run. I sometimes have unexplained chest pain, in which I recently had a CT Angiogram: I will find out results on December 1, 2009. I am a vegetarian. My height and weight are 5'7\", 150lbs.Can anyone provide help or advice to me?",
