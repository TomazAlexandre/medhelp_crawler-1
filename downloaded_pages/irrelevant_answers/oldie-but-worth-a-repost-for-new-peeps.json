    "question": "I hate meetings. I hate Higher Power. I hate anyone who has a program. To all who come in contact with me, I wish you death and I wish you suffering.Allow me to introduce myself; I am the disease of addiction. Cunning, Baffling, and Powerful! That\u2019s me. I have killed millions, and I am pleased. I love to catch you with the element of surprise. I love pretending I am your friend and lover. I have given you comfort, have I not?....... Wasn\u2019t I there when you were lonely? When you wanted to die, didn\u2019t you call me? I was there. I love to make you hurt, I love to make you cry. And better yet, I love when I make you so numb, that you can neither hurt nor cry. You can\u2019t feel anything at all. This for me is true glory. I will give you instant gratification and all I ask of you is long suffering. I\u2019ve been there for you always. When things were going right in your life, you invited me. You said you didn\u2019t deserve these good things, and I was the only one who agreed with you. Together, we were able to destroy all things good in your life.People don\u2019t take me seriously. They take Strokes seriously, Heart Attacks seriously, even Diabetes they take seriously. Fools that you are, you don\u2019t know that without help, these things would not be made possible.I am such a hated disease, and yet I do not come uninvited. You choose to have me, so many have chosen me over reality and peace.More than you hate me. I hate all of you who have a twelve step program. Your programs, your meetings, your Higher Power; all weaken me and I cannot function in the manner I am accustomed to.Now I must lie quietly. You don\u2019t see me, but I am here, growing bigger and stronger than ever. When you only exist, I can live. When you live, I can only exist. But I am here\u2026\u2026and until we meet again, if we meet again\u2026..I wish you death and suffering.Sincerely,Your Disease of AddictionAuthor Unknown",
