            "answer": "basically if you are having trouble getting pregnant and have a mild diabetes chances are you have pcos.\u00a0\u00a0pcos is a syndrome though (a collection of symptoms) and not a full blown disease.\u00a0\u00a0 Insulin resistance causes pcos and is basically pre-pre-diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0As far as the endo is concerned, my doctor said it is possible i have endo and i do have pcos.\u00a0\u00a0she thinks maybe endo too because i have severe lower back pain during the last half of my cycle and always get diarhea right before AF arrives.\u00a0\u00a0other than that there is no proof - i have never had a lap.\u00a0\u00a0there is really nothing that can be done about endo unless you want it removed.\u00a0\u00a0and it is possible to get pregnant with endo.\u00a0\u00a0pcos can also cause pain especially around ovulation time (so that could also cause my back pain possibly).\u00a0\u00a0also pcos is not really diagnosed from lab tests.\u00a0\u00a0in general you need 2 of the 3 criteria: certain number of follicles on ovaries by u/s, history of irregular cycles and hirsutism.\u00a0\u00a0since 70% of pcos patients have insulin resistance they put me on metformin without testing glucose or insulin levels.\u00a0\u00a0it is better to be treated since insulin resistance can lead to diabetes and metabolic syndrome that predisposes you to a bunch of other risk factors (high blood pressure, heart disease, etc.).",

    "question": "When I was in the ER last week and met my new doctor, she seemed astounded (especially since my mother and sister have endometriosis) that I never had a lap done to check.\u00a0\u00a0I guess it's possible to have both pcos AND endometriosis???\u00a0\u00a0The funny thing is, when I got all the tests done to check for the pcos, the lab screwed up the vials they put my blood in, so about 70% of the results never came back, and the ones that did were NORMAL!\u00a0\u00a0My old and incompetent doc went ahead and Dx'd me anyway, based on my symptoms and prior history - WITHOUT reordering the tests.\u00a0\u00a0So now that I'm 5 unsuccessful cycles (most I O'd but no BFP) into the clomid game.... I'm beginning to wonder.... maybe he was wrong all along?\u00a0\u00a0Or maybe I have both?\u00a0\u00a0Here's the thing, I'm a little confident in the PCOS Dx cuz after 5 years of packing on 12 lbs a year, I haven't gained a single POUND in the entire year I've been on metformin.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like that shows something.\u00a0\u00a0But here's the glitch - every single person in my mom's family (parents, 5 siblings, their children) with the exception of my mom has diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0One died blind from it, my 35 year old cousin has lost most of both feet, and everyone else isn't doing much better.\u00a0\u00a0I've been tested many times because I am ALWAYS ALWAYS thirsty (I have to have water w/me at all times).\u00a0\u00a0Could I have some sort of mild form of diabetes that they couldn't detect but the metformin corrected and maybe I don't even HAVE pcos????\u00a0\u00a0Who knows.... sorry, I guess it wasn't entirely a question - more thinking aloud.\u00a0\u00a0But I was interested if anyone out there had both.",
