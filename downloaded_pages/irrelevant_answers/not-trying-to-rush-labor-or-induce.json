            "answer": "Dont worry, NOTHING will bring on early labour if you are having a 'normal' pregnancy. As someone who has been overdue twice, believe me I have tried everything except castor oil! I believe you should wait until at least 36wks for the tea though...other than that, have sex, bounce on an exercise ball and walk as much as you can! Its all apparently good prep but it wont cause labour until its going to happen anyway...",

            "answer": "Ok thanks. No I wouldn't do the castor oil (heard it was very effective but very dangerous). I just want to have my body ready but nothing dangerous.",

            "answer": "I've been too scared to use it too, I have IBS as it is so regardless of the other issues it could cause, my own body probably couldnt handle it! I'm honestly pretty cynical about any of the methods as they have never worked for me, but then my last labour only lasted 4hrs so maybe the groundwork to prep my body did work. I've been at it all again and although I dont really expect to seemy baby before he is due, I have a feeling that this labour may be a speedy one too, my body has been doing lots of practicing, fingers crossed anyway!",

            "answer": "Just wanted to say good on you. I was induced last time as I had gestational diabetes..I had seven cervical sweeps and three methods of induxtuon. I was ill after labour and my daughter had to spend a week in special care baby unit because she had a bad infection which I believe is due to the fact she was forced out when not ready. I'm wiser this tome and know hot to always listen to docs.. they only offered the induction for their convenience..baby was only 6lb 6 and a half ..none of my growth scans showed her getting too big but as a first time mum o just did as they told me. I will be going into labour naturally this time unless baby's healt is at risk...so lots of walking..exercise ball. Raspberry leaf tea in the last few weeks..that helps ripen your cervix.. just basically prepare your body for labour. Good luck!!",

            "answer": "Yes you can drink red raspberry leaf tea. Also you can ask your midwife about evening primrose oil in capsules. You shouldn't use them till you are past 37 weeks but they can help ripen your cervix. The tea is for your uterus...like you said.rachyrouI'm sorry you feel like your daughter was induced too soon. That is sad and I'm glad you are doing your research to avoid that happening again.",

            "answer": "thankyou. The whole experience was traumatic for me ..I.also had a very unprofessional.midwife who was texting her boyfriend during my labour..it was so.hard to have my baby whisked off to scbu when they wpuldnt tell.me what was wrong. I was 19 and alone in the nights as boyfriends WTC have to.go home at 10pm I was so happy to take her home a week later.\u00a0\u00a0I'm hoping to go naturally. If I develop gestational diabetes again then it sadly might be the only outcome..but if they say baby is a healthy size I.will refuse induction for the sake of it..I'm so excited at the thought of.a.natural labour that I can actually enjoy and have fond memories.of. anyway didn't mean to.hijack the thread. Good luck to the original poster..I hope you found some helpful advice! Xx",

I just recently scored 142 on 1hr gest diabetes test so I had to take 3 hr test and am currently waiting on results so its good to know that they might want to induce if I have diabetes. I was induced with my first baby it wasn't a bad experience and she was10 days overdue but I just want my body to do it naturally.",

    "question": "I'm not trying to bring labor sooner (induce)...I just want to help my body for when its time. So I heard red raspberry leaf tea strengthens you're uterus and help you push during delivery! Also, having sex and (tmi) sperm going inside helps thin out cervix. My question is do these things \"induce you\" or is it going to do what I want it to and just help me. I do not want baby to come early that's why I'm asking.",
