Well best of luck and keep us posted. =)",

            "answer": "I would have to ask you your age, lifestyle, health risks and things of that nature first. Have you seen a cardio doctor? Do you have any other health problems? Those symptoms could be cardiac and then maybe not.\u00a0\u00a0There is much more that needs to be addressed. SVTs and other arrhythmias can cause you to become lightheaded and dizzy.\u00a0\u00a0Have the doctors examined you for any form of arrhythmias? Have you been tested for diabetes or had your thyroid tested?\u00a0\u00a0There needs to be so much more evaluated before assuming it is one thing or the other.\u00a0\u00a0It takes time and patience.\u00a0\u00a0Work with your doctor until they can find the reason for those symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Take care, Ally",
