            "answer": "I have a totally blocked left vessel (5 years since dx) and other vessels (collateral vessels) feed/fed the area adequately.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure there is blood flow to the area depleted by the leftside vessel in your mother-in-law's situation.I had a stent implant rightside artery (RCA) five years ago, and that vessel was 98% blocked.\u00a0\u00a0There shouldn't be any problems... I assume the blockage is greater than 70%....the AHA/AAC quideline is not to stent any occlusions less than 70% if medication can dilate the vessel to the degree there is no angina (chest pain).",

            "answer": "I'm sure this a very stressful time for your family.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a health professional, but I would agree with Kenkeith, there has to be blood flow from collateral (small) vessels that are servicing that area of the heart.\u00a0\u00a0I'd certainly proceed with relieving the blockages in the RCA (right side) of the heart.\u00a0\u00a0I'd also follow the doctor's advice as to medications, and I would very strongly suggest heart rehabilitation at your hospital.\u00a0\u00a0That will strengthen the collateral vessels, reduce the negative products of diabetes, and increase her overall health.I've had quite a number of stents and procedures, and been through three sessions with rehabilitation, three heart attacks, plus a pacemaker.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm about your Mother-in-laws age, and I can tell you it's possible to recover, but it takes some effort.\u00a0\u00a0I'd encourage her as much as possible and be proactive with her rehab.\u00a0\u00a0Keep us informed, best wishes.",

            "answer": "The question is not how many or to what extent the arteries are blocked.What is her EF value as per 2D echo.If her EF is above 40, you can avoid or postpone stenting.whether or not angioplasty is done,the following nutritional protocol should be followed.It is desirable to strengthen her heart before she goes for angioplasty.Pauling therapy, chelation therapy,Niacin and EECP are alternatives worth consideringYou should eat high fibre diet i.e., whole grains,fruits and vegetables with adequate good quality protein and omega 3 oils.Vanaspati , margarine,\u00a0\u00a0bakery foods,processed/packaged foods, maida, white rice should be avoided.Sugar should be minimized.If you are diabetic, eat only water melon and papaya.Avoid root vegetables.Eat foods rich in potassium.Use low sodium salt in small quantity.Avoid normal salt.Doctors do not give anything that boosts the strength and immunity of a patient.They are dead against nutrition.Please try the following:1.Amway protein powder and or egg whites2.Amway Salmon omega fish oil capsules 4 daily3.Bio E capsules 4 daily4.Vitamin C 2000 mg daily5.Niacin NF 2 tablets daily6.Carnitor(Levocarnitine) tablets7.Co enzyme Q10(CoQ or Ecozyme) 90 mg daily6.Cobadex 1 capsule daily7.Homoeopathic tonic Crataegus mother tincture 3 times dailyThese may help you to withstand the disease, angioplasty and the large number of medicinesStatin drugs given\u00a0\u00a0for cholesterol reduction\u00a0\u00a0reduce synthesis of Co Q10 and lead to wekness of heart muscle.Aspirin can cause bleeding in GI tract.Deficiency of vitamin C results in high cholesterol.Vitamin C and niacin help in reducing cholesterol safely.Vitamin E and omega 3 are anti coagulants.Do not use refined oils, specially sunflower or safflower.Refined sunflower or safflower oils contain neither vitamin E or omega 3.Hence, they are dangerous unless you take lots of vitamin E and omega 3.Unrefined oils like mustard oil (kachi ghani Dhara brand)or extra virgin olive oil\u00a0\u00a0or even groundnut oil or gingelly oil can be used without heating. No oil should be used for cooking.Flaxseed meal is also good.Fenugreek,blackgram, fish , walnuts and even almonds(10 per day as a mid meal snack) are good. Fresh chutneys made from peanuts, sesame seeds or coconut can be used You may use a little butter or ghee for cooking. pl visit www.paulingtherapy.com and www.vitamincfoundation.org",

    "question": "My mother-in-law (70 years old), has been diagnosed with diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure about four years ago. She had a mild heart attack about two months ago.\u00a0\u00a0She recovered and was advised to go for further evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0Instead of an angiogram, she opted for a heart scan to check for artery blockages.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, the cardiologist could not make out much as the scan showed quite a bit of calcium deposits around the heart arteries.\u00a0\u00a0She then had an angiogram done about two days ago.\u00a0\u00a0The cardiologist said that she has one block on the right side and two on the left side but the arteries on the left side of her heart are very much diceased and neither angioplasty or bypass can be done.\u00a0\u00a0She is now scheduled for another angiogram in about a week's time to facilitate angioplasty for the block on the right side.\u00a0\u00a0My questions are:1.\u00a0\u00a0What are the options she has to remove the blockages on the left side?2.. Can the diceased arteries on the left side be rehabilitated and what are the specific treatments that she can consider?3.\u00a0\u00a0Is it safe for her to proceed with angioplasty on the right side when the left side arteries are not in good shape?Will it lead to any complications?I am sorry for this lengthy question.\u00a0\u00a0My family is worried.\u00a0\u00a0Any opinion and advise will be much appreciated.3.",
