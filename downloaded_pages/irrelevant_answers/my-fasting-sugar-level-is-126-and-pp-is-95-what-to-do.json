            "answer": "In some people in very early diabetes, the first number to become abnormal may be the fasting one, even while the post eating numbers are normal.Ideally fasting numbers will be in the low 80s (range 70 - 90).The high fasting is probably due to your liver putting out sugar in response to overnight fasting (and your pancreas is not able to catch up with that), though it can still respond ok to day time meals.Approach is still the same as for regular diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Lose weight if overweight, low carb diet, exercise.\u00a0\u00a0You could also try having a small snack at bedtime (mostly fat / protein. Ie. egg and some cheese etc.), which will shorten the duration of your fasting and may help reduce the liver effect.If your Dr will agree, a dose of metformin (an insulin sensitiser) at bedtime may also be helpful to get this under control.With the high fasting you will very likely progress to overt diabetes if you do nothing.\u00a0\u00a0however, there is much you can do to delay / prevent this progression.Please do keep monitoring and vigilant.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is not a death sentence if it is managed well.\u00a0\u00a0It is just a lifetime condition to be dealt with.",

            "answer": "Hi Metformin is a\u00a0\u00a0medication that is typically used for diabetes (it is a first line drug).\u00a0\u00a0It is also used as an insulin sensitizer in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome.I have read that there is some evidence that it has a protective effect against heart disease and that there are trials ongoing.It is not a drug that people become dependent on.Consistent fasting blood sugar levels of\u00a0\u00a0120 (some say > 140 peak) then you may need to adjust what you are eating to eat foods with less carbs / more protein / fat which will digest more slowly and have less impact on blood sugars.",
