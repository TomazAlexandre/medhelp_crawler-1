            "answer": "I have my Dad had this done a few months ago and he too suffered severe spasms. He was told to move the leg as much as he could. Althouth he found this extremley painfull the more he got his joints moving again the less he got them. It was very painfull for a few weeks but now he is walking unaided and painfree apart from the occasional cramp. So I would say stick with it and it will get easier.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!See if passive physiotherapy in hands of a good physiotherapist helps. This could be a reaction to the material of the artificial joint. It can also be due to a trapped nerve or infection. Consult the surgeon and see what he says. Other than that it could be due to certain deficiencies post surgery. I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes or hypothyroidism can also be the cause. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Take care!",
