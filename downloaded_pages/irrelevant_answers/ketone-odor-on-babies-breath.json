            "answer": "Hi ilandbob,Please keep in mind that we are not doctors on this forum. I'm the mom of a diabetic teenager.It is easy to do a blood-sugar test, so to be safe I would suggest that his parents ask for him to be tested at his next pediatric exam. Just to rule out diabetes. He'll get over the shock of the ***** in a few minutes!But given the other things you say, it seems quite unlikely to be diabetes. The normal symptoms would be drinking an unusual amount of fluids, soaking his diapers and losing weight, and it sounds like none of those are happening, so the ketonic breath could be from something else, hopefully minor.Enjoy your grandson, and try not to worry-- he sounds like a healthy boy!",

    "question": "My grandson is 8 months old.\u00a0\u00a0He is a caucasion, fair haired and complexion, with blue eyes.\u00a0\u00a0Neither of his parents have diabetes, nor is it known in other close relatives.\u00a0\u00a0The baby ocassionaly has the odor of ketone, or a nail polish-like aroma, on his breath.The baby appears to be, otherwise, healthy.\u00a0\u00a0He seems to be thriving and has what appears to be normal growth thus far.\u00a0\u00a0His appetite is robust and he drinks several bottles of formula a day.\u00a0\u00a0He does not like water from a bottle, nor does he like juices that have been offered.He is advancing from scooting around to getting onto his knees and making efforts to crawl rather than pull himself along on his tummy.\u00a0\u00a0His strength and muscle tone seems to be appropriate for his size.\u00a0\u00a0He has a good grip on an offered finger when he is assisted with standing and making preliminary \"steps\", with assistance.The odor is infrequent and has only been noticed several times since his birth.\u00a0\u00a0The first instance was in his first week or two after birth.\u00a0\u00a0He has subsequently had the odor a couple times, at around 6 months and now, more recently, within the last week.\u00a0\u00a0The odor seems to last for only a day or so.",
