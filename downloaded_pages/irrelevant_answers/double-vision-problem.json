            "answer": "Double vision, seen when both eyes are open, is actually a neurological/brain issue. One of the nerves controlling the muscles of your eyes is not working properly, so your eyes are misaligned. Most patients with this problem have high blood pressure or diabetes. Your eye doctor should tell you which nerve is affected. Occasionally a CT scan or MRI is done to look for problems. Patching or blurring one eye will help, adding prism to glasses will help, but you have to wait it out. This problem usually resolves within 3-6 months on its own. Occasionally, muscle surgery is done to realign the deviating eye.",
