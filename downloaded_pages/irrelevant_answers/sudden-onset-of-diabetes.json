            "answer": "Hello,type 2 usually develops slowly.\u00a0\u00a0If you were totally negative and nothing changed as far as activity, weight, lifestyle, it would not be so common to find diabetes developing to such a level that it affects vision in 1 year.Type 1 diabetes however, can develop very quickly.if in doubt go get it checked.\u00a0\u00a0Please see your Dr and ask for testing, and let us know how you go.\u00a0\u00a0 Alternatively get a home blood sugar meter and do some testing.\u00a0\u00a0Your target blood sugar for fasting (without eating) is < 95 and ideally in the 80s. If it is 125 or higher you will have a diabetes diagnosis.For 2 hours after eating it should be < 120.\u00a0\u00a0If it is consistently over 140 or even 180 after eating you will also be diagnosed with diabetes.",

            "answer": "Hi Rainbow,If the result of 92 was a fasting blood sugar, then I'd say it's ok.\u00a0\u00a0However, many people have ok fasting blood sugars but they still have diabetes, because their blood sugars go very high after meals and then take a few hours to go down.To be sure you don't have diabetes, you should also be doing a test called Hba1c.\u00a0\u00a0Please request this test from\u00a0\u00a0your dr next time you visit.\u00a0\u00a0Thereafter, it will be a good idea to do this test at least once a year so you can monitor for and catch diabetes early.",
