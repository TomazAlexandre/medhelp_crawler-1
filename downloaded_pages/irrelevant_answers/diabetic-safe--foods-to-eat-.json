            "answer": "Google good carbs vs bad carbs is a start. However, even good carbs, as with any food, can affect an individual in different ways. Test prior to a meal and 2-3 hrs following to see how that food affected your glucose levels. Keep a written log as a reminder as to what foods you should be eating. Fruits have fructose, fruit sugar. Tropical fruits, oranges, and like are high in fructose. Berries & some melons on the other hand are low in fructose. Eat fruits with other foods to slow the absorption of fructose into the blood stream. Avoid fruit juice. Avoid man-made products, white foods [potatoes, white rice, white flour, white bread], and dairy [milk, yogurt]. These are high in sugar.",
