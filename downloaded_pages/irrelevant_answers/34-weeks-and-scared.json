    "question": "Hi I am 34 weeks but baby is measuring almost 37 with the help of my diabetes. Last night after urinating I experienced horrible pain in the middle of my pelvis. Today I woke up and my vagina is really wet as if I had sex. And its even on my sheets--no blood yet. (Sorry tmi). I called my dr she says its probably urine to not be alarmed but I am. What should I do.",
