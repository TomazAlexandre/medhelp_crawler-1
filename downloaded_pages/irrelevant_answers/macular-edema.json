    "question": "My mom's been diagnosed with macular edema in her left eye and is currently using Nevanac eye drops to reduce the inflammation. It's been 7 months now but the doctors informed us it'll be a slow process and there has been some improvement. Since 5 days back, she's been seeing a circular dimness in the center of her vision [right eye] as well and has been having difficult reading.We got an OCT done today for both the eyes today and her right eye's retinal thickness is 199 as compared to 166 two months ago. Is this normal? Or is the increase in the retinal thickness some cause of worry?",
