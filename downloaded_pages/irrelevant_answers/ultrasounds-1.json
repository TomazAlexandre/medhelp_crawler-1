            "answer": "With my first two I only had 1. Third baby I had two because my baby was smaller than he should have been and they wanted to monitor his growth. Turns out I must have ovulated late or something because my due date got bumped back a couple of weeks which was the cause of his small size. 10 1/2 weeks with baby #4 and had a sonogram in the ER due to my hyperemisis and some pain on the left side of my pelvic region and I expect to have another one with my OB around 18 weeks or so when I'll hopefully get to find out if we're having prince #4 or our first princess! I would venture to guess that most insurances allow for a set number of them but then allow others that the Dr may order for medical purposes like a high risk pregnancy or mine where they needed to double check measurements.",
