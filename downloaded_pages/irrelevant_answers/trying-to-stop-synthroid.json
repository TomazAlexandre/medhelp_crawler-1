            "answer": ".1mg is 100mcg.A medium size dose. Significant might be a better word. My Endo thinks when my thyroid is finished croaking I should be taking 100mcg. Right now I'm on 88mcg. She figures I'll settle into 100mcg eventually. When my throid is dead.Some others require twice that much. It just depends.However, Venora is correct, and Chit Chat as well.",
