            "answer": "Dilantin can elevate liver enzymes, but I think you have a liver issue, due to the swelling, bloating, and stool color. Do you notice any yellowing of your skin or eyes? If so this is jaundice, an indication of a liver problem. You need to get some liver test done, most likely the sooner the better.Hope this is helpful,Bob :)",

            "answer": "As far as I know, no. I did however have Hep A about 27 years ago. My understanding of this though is once it's all clear which is was within about 6 months of diagnosis. Life returns to normal and all is fine again..I was assuming it was my medication. Unfortunately it seems the different doctors don't talk about their specific test results. Hence not sure of where to from here.Thanks for the advise.",

    "question": "HiI've recently had another set of blood tests (after being taken to hospital after a another seizure )which are, ALP 384 (258) , GGT 615 (292), ALT 155 (82) and ASP 66 (56), up from the month prior (see the figures in brackets). I have been on Dilantin now for three weeks. Would this new medication be the result of the elevation in one month. Additionally I have noticed swelling of my feet and hands, bloating and very pale coloured faeces. I'm still waiting to see my regular specialist, should I leave this until then or follow through with my GP. Or could this be totally unrelated.Kind regards :)",
