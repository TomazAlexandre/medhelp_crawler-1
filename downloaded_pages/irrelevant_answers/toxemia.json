            "answer": "http://wrongdiagnosis.com/sym/groin_burning_sensation.htmThis is a list of what could be causing that burning groin pain. One of the options is sciatic, which is a COMMON pregnancy complaint. Another was diabetes, have you been tested for gestational diabetes?My vote is for sciatic nerve pain. If you have lower back pain, typically on one side, that radiates into your butt and even into your leg(s), it is sciatic pain.",
