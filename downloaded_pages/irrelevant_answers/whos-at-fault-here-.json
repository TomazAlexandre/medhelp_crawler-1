            "answer": "Sounds like they are being very unprofessional. I would try to switch Dr s. And if your sugar is 125 that is not out of control. I had GD with my last pregnancy, and 125 is fine. They wanted me to stay under 120 but 125 is by no means out of control. Plus my dad is diabetic and 130-140 is normal for him so how come it would be lower when you have 2 people? I have a serious problem with doctors trying to scare women because all they want is to be able to force you into unnecessary interventions. Sorry for the rant. But if your doctor is being that rude you should really try to switch if its possible for you. Good luck.",

            "answer": "If your sugar level is on 125 after u eat, is normal, as soon as I went to the first appointment they did the glucose test and I came out as diabetic, that was last year with my pregnancy, and this year my Dr just put me to monitor my sugar before put me on medicine and then gave me insulin, and now as the pregnancy progress, my sugars are getting high, I know I don't have a healthy diet but I can't eat a lot of stuff and sometimes I just don't eat and I still get my levels high, but still, you're almost done anyway, I don't think it would do anyway harm to ur baby",

            "answer": "Wow, what a Dr! That is not out of control! I would definitely advise you to make sure your protein intake is higher than sugar every time you eat something, but it doesn't sound like you really have a problem. Fruit and fruit juice is what gets me, so I try to eat only a tiny bit after a good solid meal and never on an empty stomach. I would try to switch Drs if that's how they treat you there.",

I've managed it pretty good so far with the diet and see no need for meds either. I've had spikes in my levels but still see no need for it as its not super out of control",

    "question": "So I have gd and its supposedly out of control my Dr says due to me but if anything I believe its his fault. What do you ladies think. I had requested a glucose test to my Dr at around 25 weeks bc the wic had told me to due to the fact that my bmi was already like 30 over even before pregnancy. The wic said I was most likely to have it and should request it asap. I told my Dr about it but he said it was too soon and to just wait. At 28 weeks I had the test done and failed.\u00a0\u00a0Was told to come back at 29 weeks to retest didn't fail that one as my sugar level came out to 115 but the Dr said no natter what I was beyong diabetic and needed insulin asap. Got very scared at that point. They submitted a referral to the specialist and it took them 4 weeks to get and only bc I kept pushing them. Meanwhile at each appt I kept asking my Dr for a diet plan and he would just give me dumb responses like no sugar or juices. My sugar isn't as bad and the highest it goes to is 125. Even when I went to the hospital they checked me and said I was good. My Dr keeps blaming me for the diabetes being out of control supposedly to him. And my husband made a comment to them to defend me saying its not my fault the referral took so long so now when I walk in there they call me the girl with the immature husband. Need to see from your point of view who's to blame here?",
