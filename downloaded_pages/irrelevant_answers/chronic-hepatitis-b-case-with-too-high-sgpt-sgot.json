    "question": "Hi,Need some guidance on my husband's condition. We came to know about his Hep B about 2 years back. As per all the tests done, he has this condition since birth. The hbv DNA was undected initially which changed last year. But his fibroscan and LFT were within limits, so doc didn't start his medication. We were asked to regularly monitor sgpt sgot levels. Now last month his sgpt sgot shot above the range, sgpt at about 80. Doc asked us to redo the test to make sure it was not an aberration. Now it came out too high this time with sgpt at 850+. We r meeting the doctor early this week.With your experience, would you please guide us. Would be really greatful.",
