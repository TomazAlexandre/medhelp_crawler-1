Also good to have some Mums in your life for support. I don't know how old you are but this is the 25-34 year old group, not that I mind of course but maybe you'll find other young mums to talk to in the 18-24 group who are going through the same thing.",

            "answer": "You already have a lot to deal with! :) Pregnancy in a young age, sciatica, diabetes! Your friends probably have little insight into all the changes that take place during pregnancy.Perhaps, share some informative videos with them, take your bestie with you to the next doc visit, let them be a part of your pregnancy if they are willing.\u00a0\u00a0I never knew until I was 26 and married for a year that during pregnancy, all the organs get pushed up and aside to make space for the growing baby, and so it gets tougher to breathe, eat, sleep! I was amazed to know that! lolInvolve your friends so they will know that its for real and appreciate your pregnancy better.",

            "answer": "Pregnancy certainly shows who your true friends are. As for family I would how they would understand but subsumes they still don't. Like previous post said unless someone has been pregnant it's really hard to explain how you are feeling. Hang in there cuz from other posts sounds like you are almost done. Maybe try finding some other mommy friends tho who can relate. Good luck to you",

    "question": "how do i get my friends/family to take me seriously?y strong. I have sciatica and diabetes and its kept me from enjoying my pregnancy. My friends secretly get annoyed that I'm not around to hang out anymore and don't seem to understand how excruciating every step is. Not to mention it takes me longer to do every simple task. The bottom line is I'm a young mom with young friends that just don't get it. They think I use pregnancy as an excuse.\u00a0\u00a0If only they knew!How can I get them to realize I'm not complaining or using it as an excuse? Clearly repeating myself doesn't sink in",
