            "answer": "Hi,When a limb is paralysed we think that it means no sensations can be felt, however, this is not always true. A paralysed limb still feels sensations, but they are not normal and the person experiencing it cannot move it. The sensations can be hot, cold, burning, sharp pains, dull aches etc. It all depends on the cause. If it is a neurological disorder, then the sensations can be anything from absolutely no pain & numbness, to sharp stabbing type pains. If this has been a problem for any length of time it needs to be investigated.Hope this has helped in some way",
