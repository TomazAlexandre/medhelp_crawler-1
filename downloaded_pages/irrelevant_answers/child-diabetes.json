    "question": "My niece who is 1-1/2 has the following symptoms: 1) unquenchable thirst; 2) frequent urination; and 3) scabs on her head that won't heal. She is doesn't sleep very well and is up almost 24 hours a day. The only time she falls asleep is if it is from exhaustion. The doctors don't seem to know what it is. Has anyone known of these symptoms? Are they signs of child diabetes?",
