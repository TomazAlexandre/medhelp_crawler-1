            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Best bet would be to have a culture and sensitivity done. Am hoping Diabetes has been ruled out, as this can cause persisting infections. Have a culture and sensitivity test done to find out the correct antibiotic that the infecting organism is sensitive to and taking this medication for the required amount of days may help to clear infection.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

This is given for months to years depending on the clinical condition. You can discuss this with your doctor, he could guide you.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
