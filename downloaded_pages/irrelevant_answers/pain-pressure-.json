            "answer": "What I think is that you need to get in to see an Eye MD ophthalmologist AND in to see a GP or FP or Internist for a complete medical eye exam and a complete medical exam. Very important to be sure you do not have internal injuries in your eye from the fight.Find an eye MD at www.aao.orgJCH IIMD",

            "answer": "Thanks, I didnt really think it would be related to the fight... but if you think it could be internal injuries, I will definitely listen to you and go see some docs.I was wondering if you could tell me what injuries you would suspect? As I said when I squeeze the eye it feels better when the pressure builds up - is that useful informaiton? .. What should I ask the doctors to look for? Also do you think that black dot is related to it? I believe that dot was there before this fight... Is it a tumour? Does this case sound like typical brain/ocular cancer ? of course thats my biggest fear..",

    "question": "Hi I would really like some help....Symptoms:1- Pressure behind right eye - Multiple times throughout the day and at night before bed and in the morning when I wake up.2- Slightly blurred vision - Each eye seems kinda 'weak' when i close the other, like the vision is slightly blurred and I only have normal vision when they are both open3- Spots - For years now when I go to bed if I move my eyes to far to one direction or the other I notice a black circle with a glowing thin ring around it that cuts out the edge of my vision.4- Black spot in iris - A little black spot is visible in the iris of my right eye.History: I am 20 years old, male. I have a history (years and years ago tho) of sinus infections and ear infections. I first started noticing the pressure/pain after I got in a fight and was hit several times in that eye. However that was over a year ago now so it shouldnt be related...\u00a0\u00a0Also when I was much younger I had a weird dot on my face, under my right eye like right on the edge of the bone but on my skin. The doctor removed it 3/4 years ago with an electric needle procedure in his office.A few other things that I have no idea if they could be factors:- I am slightly overweight- I have a lot of stretch marks on my sides, butt, biceps and underarms.- I notice I feel quite a bit of pressure centraly behind my nose sometimes.- I dont eat very well.. Typically alot of fast food and multiple cans of pop a day- I rarely drink enough water, I always feel thirsty even though I drink alot of pop.- I am a computer programmer - for years I have spent 8-15 hours a day on a computer- I am stressed out quite oftenAlso I notice if my eye starts to hurt from the pressure, when I 'squeeze' my eye it feels better for a bit...Things I would guess it could be, you tell me what you think:- Cushing\u2019s (tumour of pituitary gland)- Diabetes- Sinusitis- Brain tumour- Ocular tumour- Tumour in eye (that black dot?)",
