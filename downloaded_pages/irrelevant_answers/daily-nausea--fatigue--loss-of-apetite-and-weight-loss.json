            "answer": "Thank you for the comment,He has been to a specialist for his diabetes. They have said it is not related. He has been a diabetic since he was 9. He has never experienced issues like this before. He has been sick since he moved from England. We cannot figure it out at all. He has had a colonoscopy, numerous blood work, ultrasounds etc. He also went on an insulin pump. It regulates his up's and downs. His diabetes right now is the least worry he has. It's the constant throwing up, weight loss, loss of apetite, fatigues, headaches.. I thought it could be stress? He was even not sleeping for quite some time. Do you think that something with his diabetes is making him sick? Even though he has never experienced this before?",

    "question": "I'm desperate for help- Anyone out there please help. My husband moved here from England three years ago, and since then has been very ill. Every day he wakes up with Naseau, fatigue and loss of apetite. He has lost over 37 lbs in a month, the first month he arrived. He goes up and down in weight, and continues to throw up almost every morning. They have run numerous tests and cannot find anything. He is a type 1 diabetic and we still cannot figure out what is wrong with him.\u00a0\u00a0Recently the Dr prescriped him anti-depresseants, so he could sleep better. He has to force himself to eat most times. Please help ! Does anyone have any suggestions, or know what this could be? We are at a loss.",
