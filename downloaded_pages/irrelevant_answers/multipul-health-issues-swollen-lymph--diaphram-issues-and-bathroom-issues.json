            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!A lump in armpit can be a swollen lymphnode, in response to fungal infection or sweat dermatitis or infection of hair follicles. It can also be an enlarged lymphnode due to malignancy of breast. At times it is a cyst too and this can get infected. Lipoma is also a possibility. Consult your PCP for an evaluation. A CT scan can be confirmatory or a fine needle biopsy. Treatment can vary from wait and watch to anti-inflammatory along with antibiotics to excision of the lump. Check for diabetes too as high sugar often results in repeated infection and boils.Chronic constipation can be due to diet poor in roughage or fiber and also due to dehydration. A high roughage with low water too could be a cause.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes and hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc can all cause constipation. It can also be due to milk allergy and other food allergies. Since your sister has gained weight, hypothyroidism and diabetes, both of which slow down the gut and cause all water to be absorbed from the stool should be looked into.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",

    "question": "hello, my name is amber, i'm 25 yrs old, and i have for the past several months had re-occuring swollen lymphnodes underneath my arms.. i know that lymph is something that helps your body get rid of toxins, and am not sure what is wrong. i unfortunatly do not have and can't get health insurance... other recent health issues that may or may not be related are that my diaphram area has been hurting and swollen, i had an upset stomach about a week ago and it hurt all along my diaphram area along with tightness and uncomfortable feeling.. for aprox two years now i have also had issues using the bathroom.. sometimes it's up to four days once up to seven before having a bowel movement.. i'm not sure what's causing all these issues, but the lymph nodes are not soft they are hard and hurt, i have one as of the night before last that has been rather large and burns at times along with the pain and irritation.. other than under my arm pits i haven't had problems with swollen lymph, accept once that was on the inner part of my leg almost up to my vagina.. if there is any insite that someone may have it'd be appreciated. i'm begining to worry that something could be wrong with this series of health issues reoccuring. . . the stomach problem hasn't been an issue until this past week and am not sure if it is related or not?? thanks so much!",
