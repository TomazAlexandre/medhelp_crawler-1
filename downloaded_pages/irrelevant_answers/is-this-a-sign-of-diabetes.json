            "answer": "The only reason I am not sure if this is diabetes or not is because I have only felt this way 8 times. I don't have these symptoms, even given the precursor of not eating. Like I will eat at 8PM and sometimes not eat again till 3PM, and I still feel fine. Can diabetes or pre-diabetes be sporadic like that?Ok, now I am done.Thanks",

            "answer": "\"my weight goes up and down by 20 pounds about 2 or 3 times a year.\" that right there sounds like my hypothyroid issues\"I noticed that if I eat lunch at 11AM and haven't eaten anything again till like 9 PM that my body starts acting funny. I feel really kind of sick (\"achy\"), have a headache (which makes me feel slightly lightheaded, but it may just be a headache... because no dizziness or anything), I am also cranky during this time.\"You need to eat more than twice a day... your eating a meal at 11am and not again until 9pm.... any normal person would feel achy, sick, cranky and have a headach/light headed, it means you need food.Diets are funny, if your overweight its better to eat a lot of small healthy snacks.. like 6-5 per day than to eat 2 larger meals. You will drop more weight if you eat 5-6 small healty meals than if you 1-2 meals. When your body feels starved it tends to hold on to fat.",

            "answer": "You need to see a doctor and get tested for diabetes along with your thyroid gland. Putting off finding a doctor for three years is no excuse for there are lots of doctors around, that is, unless you live in a one horse town. Putting off your problem will make it worse and/or cause more internal problems. You're still very young. Mess up your health now and it will be messed up for a long time. You don't want that to happenDon't misinterpret the word diet. Diet in diabetes sense is proper nutrition at all times not your \"dieting roller coaster.\" Proper nutrition is not hard to follow. You'll feel much better when you adhere to a healthier life style.",

    "question": "So I will start with saying that I am a high risk for type 2 diabetes. It runs in my family on both sides. I am 21, and have been overweight all of my life (just under the obese break off). I am moderately active. My diet, well, for a few months I eat extremely healthy and then I eat extremely unhealthy (like the dieting roller coaster); my weight goes up and down by 20 pounds about 2 or 3 times a year.Anyways, on to what I am worried about.I noticed that if I eat lunch at 11AM and haven't eaten anything again till like 9 PM that my body starts acting funny. I feel really kind of sick (\"achy\"), have a headache (which makes me feel slightly lightheaded, but it may just be a headache... because no dizziness or anything), I am also cranky during this time.When I start to feel these symptoms, if I eat something, I will feel better within minutes. (That's why I think it is a blood-sugar problem)I figured this was a change in blood sugar, is it normal for blood sugar to fluctuate enough to cause these symptoms? Or am I in stages of pre-diabetes or diabetes? My mom says that now that I have experienced this, \"it is a question of how long till I get diabetes, not if I will get diabetes.\"Are these the symptoms you guys experienced pre-diagnosis?Thanks",
