    "question": "I have recently been diagnosed with lattice, I have had myopia for many years, since I was a teenager. Several years ago I had PRK laser done and my distance vision was signifigantly improved. Although, i have had some regression since the laser I still can see at a distance and require reading glasses. My concern is will this get worse and could it lelead to retinal detachment, what signs should I be looking out for?? My optamologist just said to come back in six months or more and something about laser could be used if there was a problem. I didn't have a chance to ask any questions and I am concerned as to whether I should be seeing a specialist that just deals with this particular problem. This optomologist did the laser on my eyes and has done all the followups as I also have type 2 diabetes. He just mentioned that this conditon of course has nothing to do with the diabetes. What about the laser treatment?",
