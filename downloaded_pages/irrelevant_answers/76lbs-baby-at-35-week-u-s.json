            "answer": "I did not have measurements taken before my 1st and 2nd babies were born, but they were 9.4 and 10.5 pounds, both 21 inches long. I did have c-sections with them both because neither would drop into the birth canal. The c-sections went fine because they were not rushed or emergency.I love big babies because they are strong and healthy and when they lose a little weight during those first few days, they started out with plenty to spare. There is the challenge of clothing though because baby clothing manufacturers tend to use the 50 percentile growth chart for sizing and my babies were always 95% or above so were usually in the size or two bigger than their age. They both grew out of the infant car seat within 4-5 months too!\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes!!!!",

I thought about the clothing thing too.\u00a0\u00a0I know that she'll probably be over 8lbs which will put her out of newborn clothing.\u00a0\u00a0A friend of mine gave me a lot of stuff from when her daughter was born.\u00a0\u00a0Much of it is preemie, yeah, that's not going to work.\u00a0\u00a0We'll see how it goes.\u00a0\u00a0Overall, I'm ok, as long as there will be no ill effects toward her.\u00a0\u00a0=)",

            "answer": "Well I cannot say I have ever been in this posiion before now, as all my babies were born early and the biggest was 6lbs10oz., well I went for an appt. on Tuesday and the doctor said she neded to order an US b/c this was a big baby. I was floored to say the least. She said we would need to make a plan since it was doubtful with my history that I would be able to vaginally have a baby much bigger than 7 lbs. I have to say I don't want a c-section b/c of the recovery period. I am going to be at home with my 2yr old and a new baby so I hope not to have the added recovery time. (don't want to spend my vacation money on a baby nurse lol). Well I know I didn't help you with your question but I am just a bit worried and maybe you can put a plan together with your doctor as well. Good Luck!! Sheri 35 wks 2days",

    "question": "So I had my 35 week u/s to check the baby's position, weight, and amniotic fluid levels.\u00a0\u00a0They are estimating that the baby weighs 7.6lbs.\u00a0\u00a0Doesn't that seem a bit high?\u00a0\u00a0She's supposed to gain 1/2 lbs per week until birth.\u00a0\u00a0That's four weeks away, give or take a few days.\u00a0\u00a0I asked the sonographer how accurate these measurements are and she said that the baby was in a great position for measuring.\u00a0\u00a0Her belly and head were perfect so she doesn't think the weight is off by much.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a little worried that the baby will be too big.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't gained an excessive amount of weight.\u00a0\u00a0What do you all think?\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone had large measurements at 35 weeks and ended up with a huge baby?\u00a0\u00a0Just wondering.\u00a0\u00a0As long as she's healthy, I'm cool with it.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to be prepared.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for any advice you have!",
