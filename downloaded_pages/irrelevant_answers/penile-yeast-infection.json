            "answer": "Welcome back to our Forum.\u00a0\u00a0I am not familiar with the test that you mention but I will accept at face value your statement that your partner has a yeast infection and go from there.Typically fungal infections in women arise from yeast that are normally present in the vaginal when conditions favor development of overgrowth of the yeast.\u00a0\u00a0While certain conditions such as recent antibiotic use, diabetes and cancer therapy can increase the likelihood that a yeast infection will occur, in most women there is no obvious predisposing event.Yeast infections are much less common in men than women.\u00a0\u00a0When men get yeast infections they can arrise spontaneously just as they do in women but on some occasions, they can also arise from contact with an infected sex partner.\u00a0\u00a0When they occur they can appear as red bumps or a rash and red or pink bumps in the infected area.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes but not always they itch.With that as background:1.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, you could have gotten an infection.2.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, application of an over-the-counter topical yeast medication such as Monistat in small amounts 2-3 times a day will typically clear up yeast infections (don't let the fact that the label says for vaginal yeast infections keep you from getting it).\u00a0\u00a0In addition, being sure to keep the affected area clean and dry also helps.Hope this helps.

    "question": "Hello Doctor,Myself(male) and partner(female) have been both tested for 8 panel STD and everything came up negative.\u00a0\u00a0Over the weekend the female complained of yeast infections symptoms and took an over counter yeast infection test and came back positive of 4.5 to 5.A day later I noticed I have white/some reddish bumps on the head and under the ridge of the penis.\u00a0\u00a0There is one cluster of 5-6.\u00a0\u00a0They are relatively small but can be seen.Two questions:Is it possible that I have contracted a penile yeast infection?If so what would be the best next step?\u00a0\u00a0I did read that men can apply Monistat.Thanks a bunch.",
