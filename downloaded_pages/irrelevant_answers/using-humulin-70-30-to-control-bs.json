            "answer": "Hi,it is really best to be monitored by a doctor for this.I use humulin 70/30.\u00a0\u00a0You have to be aware that you can get lows if you overdose and these can be dangerous.Are you able to monitor your blood sugar freqently?\u00a0\u00a0You should be monitoring fasting levels and 2 hours after meals to be sure that you are well adjusted. Target is fasting of 80 - 100 and 2 hours after meals of < 120.Important also is to eat a low carb diet and to exercise as this will reduce your insulin requirements markedly.Just as a reference, I started off with about 4 units in the mornign and 4 at night.\u00a0\u00a0Adjust by 1 - 2 units every 3 days until target levels are reached. Start low and adjust slow. You must be consistent with eat (particularly the morning when there is risk of going low).Please know I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice nor should you make any decisions based on what i've written.\u00a0\u00a0I am only sharing my experience.\u00a0\u00a0Please look for a clinic & dr. to help on this.\u00a0\u00a0Read up on managing insulin / blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0There are good sources online and books avaialble at your local library.",

            "answer": "A primary issue is whether or not Humalin 70/30 is appropriate. Your condition might be treated with an alternative, such as Lantus plus Metformin, or another oral drug.Because abnormal blood sugar levels induced by injectable insulin can cause you to have a fatal automobile accident and injure or endanger others, it is not a drug that should be administered except under a physician's supervision - at least until the situation is well in hand. \"Reading Up\" on the units to administer is not a responsible action.I know for a fact there are inexpensive diabetic clinics and care available throughout the United States that will get you headed in the right direction. This is a complicated disease and there is far more to keeping diabetes under control than administering a specific amount of insulin.",
