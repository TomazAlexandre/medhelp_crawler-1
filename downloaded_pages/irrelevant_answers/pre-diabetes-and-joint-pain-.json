            "answer": "I have the same condition. It is likely you have a candida yeast overgrowth. It could be caused by many different reasons. You need to change your diet to a candida diet and start taking certain supplements. Some supplements will help you detox and some will help with killing the overgrowth. The reason you get joint pain from this condition is because the yeast feeds off of the carbohydrates you ingest and releases toxins. I had this condition for many years and was told I had fibromyalgia. Then I was told I had lyme disease and a parasitic infection. I was in treatment for lyme for three years and it didn's seem to take care of all of my symptoms. Many things got worse. I finally decided to do the candida diet which helped greatly with my fatigue but I still suffered with joint pain. I looked into supplements that would help with candida and I started taking molebdenum.How does Molybdenum help with Candida?To understand how molybdenum can help with Candida, you need to see how your Candida overgrowth is releasing toxins into your system. The Candida yeast lives on sugars in your gut. When it processes these, one of the byproducts that it releases is a neurotoxin named acetaldehyde. This is just one of the toxins that Candida releases (there are a total of 79!), but it happens to be the most important.Acetaldehyde has a whole host of detrimental effects on your health and wellbeing. It can impair your brain function and even kill brain cells. Your endocrine, immune and respiratory systems can all be affected, and it also damages the membranes of your red blood cells, reducing their ability to carry oxygen round the body. Again this directly affects your brain, so you can see how acetaldehyde is linked to Candida symptoms like brain fog and fatigue.Acetaldehyde stays in your body \u2013 it does not get excreted like other toxins. A build up or accumulation of acetaldehyde can lead to joint pain, a feeling of weakness and aches in muscles, in addition to those harmful effects on your brain.Molybdenum helps by converting the acetaldehyde into acetic acid. This can then be excreted from the body like any other toxin. Alternatively, the acetic acid can actually be converted into an enzyme named acetyl coenzyme A, which is actually an important part of your metabolism. Acetaldehyde is also released during Candida Die-Off, which is when molybdenum is especially useful. If you think you are undergoing Die-Off and you are experiencing the usual fatigue and flu-like symptoms, Molybdenum may be able to help.I hope this helps. If you go to your doctor it is likely he or she will diagnose you with fibromyalgia and not do anything for you other than try to give you antidepressents wich do not help anything.If you need more info look up the Candida diet by Lisa Richards.Good Luck",

            "answer": "Hello,has your thyroid been checked.\u00a0\u00a0Low thyroid is a classic cause of fatigue, joint pain, and can even contribute to insulin resistance.To test tthyroid you should be tested for FT3, FT4 (normal is middle of range or higher), and TSH (2 or less is considered truly normal).\u00a0\u00a0However, results of FT3 and FT4 are more important than TSH.",

    "question": "I have been experiencing all over joint pain and fatigue for over a year now. My doctor has done a lot of standard testing and says, based on my blood sugar levels I have pre diabetes. While I know from reading that this would account for the fatigue and general feeling of exhaustion I can't find anything that would explain the joint pain. Does anyone else out there have joint pain and stiffness all over the body associated with pre diabetes??? Any thoughts?",
