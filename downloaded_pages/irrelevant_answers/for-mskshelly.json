    "question": "Hello MSKshelly. ChitChatNine told me to correspond with you concerning IC.Here is my history on the bladder. I have always had frequent urination (10+ years). It had never been painful, I would just go quite often (25+ times -voiding), even at night. When I would go to the doctor they would always just tell me to quit drinking so much liquids. I never had a UTI so they quit trying to figure it out. I drank anywhere from 36-48 oz a day. I was tested for diabetes, diabetes insipiduous, had ultrasounds, ct scan of kidneys. All okay. The kidey & endo basically told me to quit drinking liquids, so I stayed at 12-24oz a day, literally. It did not matter how much I drank, i would still have to go, i can not hold my liquids, if I do it becomes painful down there...I finally switched doctors due to other health factors going on. This one doctor had the concept of sending me to a urologist, which by the way after years of complaining I was never referred too. She did the cystoscopy & biopsy, it came back IC. She told me I have had it for years, so she has me on Pot K, and Bactrim, and Urelle. Those have helped a lot. I still go a lot, but I can hold it longer than I normally would.My question is, will this ever go away? Would having had graves/hyperthyroidism be a factor? I will not see my urologist for another 3 weeks, so I was just wondering. Is it normal for the kidneys to hurt from time to time with this?",
