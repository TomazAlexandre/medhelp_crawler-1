            "answer": "Hi!You should consult a doctor to rule out diabetes, hypothyroidism, anemia, electrolyte imbalance, low iron, low vitamin D and cervical nerve compression in the neck. Sleep disturbances and low or high blood pressure too can cause similar problems. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
