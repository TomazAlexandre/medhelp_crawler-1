Yes, you can live without a pancreas although you would prefer not to. Living without a pancreas is not like living without a gallbladder or appendix or even spleen.A person without a pancreas will be diabetic and will have to take insulin. That",

    "question": "Hi, my Nan just recently found out that her pancreas has \"dried up\", or is basically on it's way out. ..I know you can live without one, but, there's a high risk you can become diabetic due to it. The only thing is; She already suffers from diabetes as well as other things, and I was wondering how it would affect her..?Also, her kidney's are in really bad condition, and I was wondering if it were possible that I gave her one of mine? I understand that I'd have to undergo tests and what-have-you, but, I just wish to know if it'd be safe for someone of my age's (18) kidney to go into my nan's? (If it's a match, of course)And what the risks would be.And, one final question; Is there such thing as a pancreas transplant? I've never heard of such a thing before, but would be willing if possible..I'm sorry if this seems trivial and a lot to answer, but my mind won't rest until I find out if there's any way I can help her..Thank you so much for your time, and all the best~",
