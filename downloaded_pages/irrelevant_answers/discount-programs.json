    "question": "Hi all! I had a heart attack and was diagnosed with diabetes almost a year ago that turned my life upside down. Since the attack and quadruple bypass surgery I've lost my house, car, and can no longer do the work I've been doing for the last 30years b/c of the physical requirements. I've applied for and been denied Disability and don't know where to turn. My challenge now is being able to the afford my medicine needed every month of about $150. I am still on my ex-husband's medical plan but even w/his insurance, with NO income, the co-pays and medicines are too high....does anyone know of an organizations or discount programs or low cost supplemental insurance that would help?..at least until/if i'm approved for disability??",
