            "answer": "If you have a doctor that checks and responds to free T3 and free T4, you are doing better than most here.\u00a0\u00a0Based on your free T3 and free T4, and assuming what I believe the ranges are, I can understand why your doctor prescribed a small increase in meds, since you still have symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Numerous members here have reported feeling best when their free T3 is in the upper third of its range and TSH at the very low end of its range.\u00a0\u00a0What med. are you taking and what amount?",

            "answer": "I was on 120mg before he decreased the dosage to 90mg after routine blood work back in January because my TSH was at 0.04.\u00a0\u00a0I didnt realize I was over medicated.\u00a0\u00a0The nurse called and asked it I was having heart palpatations, etc. I told her I felt great, that only thing I had noticed is that I was grinding my teeth.\u00a0\u00a0After that they lowered the medication to 90mg the teeth grinding did stop, but I got tired and started to slowly gain weight.\u00a0\u00a0I had to have my 8 week blood work done to see how the decrease in medication was doing and I got the call that said everything was normal.\u00a0\u00a0I told the nurse \"everything doesnt feel normal\", so the re-did the test and I went for results yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0Those are the lab numbers I posted. I asked him about the other test being a low normal and he suggested that maybe I see an Endo, but he was willing to raise the 90mg to 105mg. So, the I am thinking I will wait to see if the additional 15mg takes care of the blaaz or if something else needs attending to.\u00a0\u00a0If so, I will see and Endo, because it seemed clear that anything past the TSH test was out of his expertise.Thanks...Kathy",

            "answer": "Just a couple of thoughts for you.\u00a0\u00a0When you are on thyroid meds,, a TSH below .3 doesn't mean you are actually hyper, if you do not have hyper symptoms along with it.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors are cautious about a TSH in the lower end of its range and below, in order to avoid hyper symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Rather than rely on patients accurately describing symptoms and responding accordingly, many doctors rely instead on TSH.Many members here have their TSH suppressed below the .3 level, in order to feel well.\u00a0\u00a0My own TSH level has been below .1 for 20 years.\u00a0\u00a0If this is what it takes for you, then you may well have to find a doctor who understands thyroid problems and will medicate you appropriately, or work with your current doctor to alleviate his concerns in this area.Going to an Endo does not automatically assure the expertise you want.\u00a0\u00a0Many of them specialize in diabetes, and not thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe you should just start inquiring about an Endo that specializes in thyroid problems, and that someone would recommend, based on their own experience. It might take some time to locate such a doctor and even get an appointment.\u00a0\u00a0In the interim, I would suggest that you not yet give up on your current doc, but instead, do some reading and researching on below limit TSH levels and discuss with him,\u00a0\u00a0so that hopefully you can get the med. you need to relieve symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0 If this does not work out, then by that time you should be able to locate a good thyroid doctor.",
