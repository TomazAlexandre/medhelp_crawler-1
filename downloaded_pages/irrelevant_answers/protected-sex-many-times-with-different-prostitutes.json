            "answer": "If you used condoms consistently for vaginal sex and never had a slippage or breakage, your risk is extremely low.\u00a0\u00a0Further, the large majority of commercial sex workers in the US and most industrialized countries are HIV negative.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, statistically the odds are that at least 1 or 2 of your \"80 to 90\" commercial sex workers had HIV.All in all, your odds of being infected are low.\u00a0\u00a0But the only way to know for sure is to be tested.\u00a0\u00a0You need to bite the bullet and do it.\u00a0\u00a0Your rationale against testing of course is irrational:\u00a0\u00a0the blood test does not \"pose a life risk\"--your behavior does that, not the test.\u00a0\u00a0Just do it.Good luck--\u00a0\u00a0HHH, MD",

But as you say, I just have to bite the bullet. There is a local clinic that offers rapid testing with a small amount of blood, is this any less accurate than other tests.Thank you for your help.",

    "question": "I was separated and subsequently divorced about 3-1/2 years ago. Over the past 3 years I have had about 80 to 90 encounters with different prostitutes. About a third of the encounters involved vaginal sex with a condom and oral sex both with and without a condom. As far as I know with the vaginal sex there never any condom breakage or other issues such as bleeding, herpes, etc. The rest of the encounters involved strictly oral sex, with and without a condom, which I understand is a low or no real risk activity. The last encounter was about 4 months ago, and again there has been no sign of warts, herpes or skin problems.I am a heterosexual non IV drug user, I am being treated for several other diseases (diabetes, sleep apnea, high blood pressure, etc) and I have developed into a worrier about everything. My question is what is my level of risk, I cannot bring myself to have another medical test that may a poses a life risk unless I absolutely have to. I know you cannot give an absolute certain opinion, but I am looking for an informed opinion so I can make a decision. I am unsure why I am suddenly worried now about HIV,when most of the encounters came over a year ago, but the fact is I am.",
