    "question": "22/m here with MS. I am an active athlete and I believe I have completely overtrained myself. Symptoms are fatigue, frequent urination, fatigue, sleeplessness, mentally slow, and decreased to zero libido. My blood tests are available below. Obviously, testosterone at 71 ng/dL is a major concern along with LH at 1.1. Can anyone interpret these for me and rule out hypothyroid vs. overtraining. I have since stopped training and plan on taking 2 weeks to rest and recovery intensely. Any comments are appreciated.Thank you-Prolactin \u2013 8.1 NG/MLTT4 \u2013 UG/DLFT4 - 79 ng/dLTSH \u2013 0.397 uiu/mLTT3 - .65 NG/MLFSH \u2013 2.5 MIU/MLLH \u2013 1.1 MIU/MLSerum,Testosterone \u2013 71 ng/dLCortisol \u2013 10.9 UG/DL",
