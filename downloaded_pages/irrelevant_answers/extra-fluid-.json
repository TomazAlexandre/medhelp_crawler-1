            "answer": "Do u have gestational diabetes? It's a common symptom with that, and that's why I had it. Once I got my sugars under control my fluid level went down. My doctor told me they would only be worried if it was still high after I was full term (now I'm 38 weeks and it's at a normal level). If it had stayed high then they would have induced me at 38 weeks so they could control breaking my water because he said they have to make sure the babies head drops down before the cord comes out because that would mean an emergency c-section.... But you are early so you have plenty of time for your levels to go down.",
