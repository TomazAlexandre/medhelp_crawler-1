She is supposed to be calling...Anyway, my Dr's office prescribed the one touch ultra 2 meter for me. You can test on your palm or forearm instead of our poor little fingertips. I know mine still hurt from that test.",

            "answer": "If you don't get a meter free let me know and I'll be happy to send you a brand new one. My mom is a diabetic and she received two meters and only needs one. She gets a new one all the time so she told me to find someone that might need a new meter. I can't remember right off what brand it is, but I do know it's one of the newer ones, I think one that you can test on your arms and legs or something like that. If you want it you can email me and give me your address and I'll get it sent out to you. ***@****",
