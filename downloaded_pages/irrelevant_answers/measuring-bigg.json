            "answer": "There are other reasons you could be measuring big. I'm a little overweight so I measured a little big, too. Sometimes you can measure big if you're bloated, have gestational diabetes or placenta previa, also if you have an excessive amount of amniotic fluid or if this isn't your first pregnancy. If your due date is off, your doctor can help you with that. I'm getting another ultrasound at 28 weeks to see if my due date is off.",
