You say he's traveled to several countries. Has he been checked for parasites? I think he should be. He could have very well picked up something in his travels. I wish I could be of more help to you, I'm not even sure what kind of Dr he would need to see. A specialist probably. Try googling parasites and see if you can find any of his symptoms and what kind of Dr to see. I could be way of base here but with what he's going through it won't hurt to have this idea checked out. Take care. Remar",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!It is possible to feel tremors all over the body. Travelling to tropical places can also result in cysticercosis, which can cause a worm in the brain resulting in whole body tremors and later into strokes.\u00a0\u00a0Tremors are often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, poor sleep patterns, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. friend will need to consult an internal medicine specialist or PCP. Discuss these possibilities with the doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I saw this post and had to ask if any diagnosis has been made. My dear friend is suffering from similar symptoms. He is 24 years old and will have an episode of severe body tremors, his sympathetic nervous system is activated, sweaty hands and feet, high blood pressure and high heart rate. He also has problems with diahrea. These episodes come on at random times and he is alert and oriented during them. Very much like what is described by hyepod. He has seen the neurologist, GI doc, ID doc, has had PET scans, MRI's ... you name it. Nobody can figure it out. Has there been any improvement with your sister-in-law? any diagnosis? My friend has travelled to many tropical places ... Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Senegal. Has your sister-in-law been to any of these countries or one like them? Any and all info is appreciated.Thank youThis discussion is related to/posts/show/199398.",
