            "answer": "Hi,How old are you?I would assume that you are female.Did this occur just recently and is this sudden in onset?I suggest that you have a prompt consult with an internist for a complete physical examination.This may be a case of skin infection and involvement of deeper structures need to be ruled out. If there are lumps or bumps on the breast or armpits, if there is any change in size of the breast, then a prompt consult is necessary.At this point, if we are only considering more superficial skin conditions, this may be an eczematous disease. Cellulitis , mastitis and fungal infections also need to be ruled out.Do you have any diabetes?Any chronic use of steroids before?Do you perform\u00a0\u00a0self breast examination regularly?Seek an internist's assessment as soon as possible. You may need oral medications for this. An ultrasound or mammogram may be requested if indicated.",

            "answer": "Hi,The soreness and the acuteness of the condition suggests that this may be an infection. A skin infection has to be considered here. This may be a case of mastitis. \"Mastitis is a medical condition characterized by an inflammation of the breast. It can occur in women who are lactating, as well as in women who are not lactating, and even in men.\"Source:http://www.wisegeek.com/what-causes-mastitis.htmI suggest you have this assessed promptly. A complete physical examination is necessary to rule out a more severe infectious process like cellulitis. Also a complete breast examination may be necessary. Your physician may request for a breast ultrasound to exclude involvement of other structures.As for your fiance, frequent hand washing is important. Avoid any intimate contact for the moment until your condition has been assessed.",
