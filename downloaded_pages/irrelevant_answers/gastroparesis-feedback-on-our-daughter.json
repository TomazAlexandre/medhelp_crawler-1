    "question": "We have our 30 yr old daughter who's had diabetes since she was 6.\u00a0\u00a0At the end of Aug '04 Gastroparesis began to show it's ugly face.\u00a0\u00a0Kristy began to get critically ill at the end of October, constant vomiting 24/7 & pain. Now has J Tube surgically installed between her stomach & her small intestine.\u00a0\u00a0With 4 solid months of hell for her, constant in depth research by Mom & Dad, and more than several docs - it seems the 4 hour motility test (it may also be called a Gastrogram)is the best way to find out specifically to what degree each person might have Gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0Some docs who mean well only do the test for 1 or 2 hrs and then begin to try & treat w/those findings.\u00a0\u00a0Well, after going to a Gastro Whiz Doc who truly specializes in this Gastroparesis & w/more in depth reseach - the 4 hour test is proving to be the true BINGO! In many Gastroparesis patients their stomachs lay motionless until the 3rd hour... & some patients their stomachs began to process food very close to the 4th hour - but there was some processing, which is extremely important for the docs to know how best to treat their patients and to help them have as much GOOD quality of life in their lives that they can.\u00a0\u00a0 Wanted to share to maybe help save some precious time & suffering for others...\u00a0\u00a0 GOD bless all & bye for now...",
