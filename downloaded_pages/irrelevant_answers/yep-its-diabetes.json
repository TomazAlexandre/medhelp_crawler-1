            "answer": "Sorry about the diagnosis, but at least it isn't going to go untreated.My son has Type one diabetes. He hates the shots. He isn't thrilled with the finger jabs, either.I did the glucose testing several times a day for three months. The finger sticking isn't too bad, but it gets old after a while.Look on the bright side. You'll feel better.Easy for me to say. I didn't come home with a new diagnosis.We really took our perfect health for granted when we were younger, eh? I know I just assumed it would go on and on and on.",
