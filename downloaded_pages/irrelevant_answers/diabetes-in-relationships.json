            "answer": "You don't really say if it is your boyfriend who is having all these feeling of doubts about his life \"being over\" or if that is what you THINK he might feel. If it is the latter, let it go! If he is accepting and dealing with his diabetes then you need to do the same. If, on the other hand, he is depressed about his diagnosis than he needs to get some help and you can't do this for him either. Help could be getting on a forum with a lot of people who are successfully managing their Type 1 diabetes (HE can e-mail me and I will send him some urls) or it might entail a real-life support group.What can you do? Treat him the same as you did before and emphasize the things you both enjoy in life aside from diabetes. For the diabetes you need to take the cue from him. He is the one who needs to manage his diabetes, not you. But you can certainly ask \"how can I help?\" and then respect whatever he says.",

            "answer": "Hi, It takes some time to get use to the idea and accept it as part of your life. Keep supporting him and if you can try to eat what he is suppose to eat like measure your portions and eat vegetables and fruits too. But it will help if he can talk to other people that have gone through the same thing. I'm 46 been diabetic for 45 and used to do everything the old fashion way because I was scared to try something new. My husband of 2 and a half years encouraged me and supported me to move on and try. I have been on the pump for 1 yr now and I like it but it wouldn't have worked without him by my side telling me that we can do it and everything is goint to be ok. You get tired some times and depressed because is an ongoing thing and sometimes even with the pump you can't control you sugars very well. It happens but your support is going to keep him afloat. Show him that he can have a normal life, go out and have fun, he has to have a positive attitude, he has to win over his diabetes not the other way around, life is too short to sit at home and feel sorry for himself, tell him DON'T WORRY BE HAPPY!!! Also, you could tell him not to be a crying baby this is worse in woman. I couldn't have my own children but God gave me the blessings of raising 3 children that I consider my own. I'm not crying about it I'm very thankful. BE POSITIVE!!!!!!~!!~",

    "question": "I am 22 yo and serving in the Air Force where I met my 19 yo bf! We met in tech school and have been together now for about four months...All my bf ever wanted to do was be a pilot but while he was in BMT he had a strenuous virus that attacked his pancreas and killed all of his beta cells causing him to become clinically diagnosed as a type one diabetic at the mere age of 19 and was recently medically discharged (retired) from the air force. He is wearing the pump and I have a little bit of experience with diabetes because I was in the health care field before joining! My question is how do I help him see that his life is not over and that there is much more to life than diabetes! He is a very smart man with alot of intelligence I just do not want to see this bring him down...he has had it now for about a year...after he was discharged he moved to NC to be with me while I am here and is finding it very hard to get a job which is putting a strain on him I am trying everything I can willfully and spiritually to give him the moral support he needs! With continuous growth in the medical field I know that diabetes cannot be cured but it is def something that you can live with and still have a normal life. So, my question is what else can I do to make him feel comfortable and ensure him that everything will be ok...i do not see his diabetes as a defect in him at all I love him no matter what :)",
