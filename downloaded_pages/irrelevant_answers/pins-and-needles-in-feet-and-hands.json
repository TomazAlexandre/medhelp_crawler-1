            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Sensory changes in the extremities may be a form of a sensory neuropathy. There are two types of sensory neuropathies in the body \u2013 large and small fibers. With small fiber neuropathies, symptoms include burning, tingling, or buzzing or other vague symptoms starting in the feet and hands then in some cases spreading to other parts of the body. The EMG/nerve conduction studies (NCS) (tests done to check for neuropathy) will not show an abnormality, and a definitive diagnosis can only be made with a skin biopsy so that the number of nerve endings can literally be counted. There are other tests of the function of small nerves that can be ordered, such as QSART testing which looks at how much sweat the skin makes, since sweating is in a sense of function of these small nerves. There are several causes of small fiber neuropathy, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, and autoimmune problems.Given your history of diabetes, it may be related. It would be good to have an evaluation by your primary physician to ensure that there is not another process occurring. You should also work with your physician to control your diabetes. Uncontrolled diabetes can have many adverse effects on the body including affecting the brain, kidneys, eyes, etc.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
