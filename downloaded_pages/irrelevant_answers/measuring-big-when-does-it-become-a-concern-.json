            "answer": "My baby has been measuring big as well. My doctor has me get weekly ultrasounds in order to track his growth. He is perfectly healthy. Just big. But big babies run in my hubby's family so it didn't come as a big surprise. My son has been consistently 3-4 weeks ahead. My doctor told me my due date will probably get adjusted as we get closer to the end. I wouldn't be overly concerned. Big babies are also common if you have gestational diabetes. But if you don't, you could just have a big baby. I'm 33 weeks.",

            "answer": "I just had a dr appointment a little while ago and my dr told me that my son could basically come at any time. Like I said before, I'm measuring 4 weeks ahead. I'm a bit curious though. At 28 weeks, was the weight for your baby given with you being three weeks ahead or was she actually measuring 28 weeks? When I was 28 weeks my son was measuring 4lbs. And that was with him being 4 weeks ahead.",
