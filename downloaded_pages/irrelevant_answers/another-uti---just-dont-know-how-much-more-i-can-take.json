    "question": "I'm 36w4d and I was told that I have yet ANOTHER UTI.... I told my doctor that I have an insatiable thirst and was waking up every 2 hours last night to get something to drink and go pee... diabetes was not a thought since I already have gestational diabetes and my blood sugar levels have been good... I drink a lot of fluids-- water, milk, some juice, and eat a LOT of ice... she sent me for labs to check my iron levels since I have always been slightly anemic and also wanted to check my thyroid levels... tested ny urine for a UTI and got positive.... 3rd UTI this pregnancy... plus vaginosis, high blood pressure, low blood pressure, bleeding, gestational diabetes, SPD, severe back pain,, morning sickness that hasn't gone away, preterm contractions, being monitored for preeclampsia, and I'm start to become very depressed... I think about my last pregnancy and how it was a cake walk but I was miserable (since hubby was deployed) and this time I just wanted to enjoy this pregnancy because he is home and it has been just one thing after another.... I just dont know how much more I can take... they will induce at 39 weeks-- I really don't want to be induced but I think I will schedule it for the 1st day possible-May 29th and hope I go earlier",
