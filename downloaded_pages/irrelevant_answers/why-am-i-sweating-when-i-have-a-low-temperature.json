            "answer": "What we didn't see mentioned in your post is how well you are controlling and managing your diabetes. Also interesting that you took your temperature. Why? Do you experience low body temps more often than not? I've experienced night sweats before yet never in my wildest dreams thought about reaching for a thermometer.Some medical reasons for low body temperatures can be Addison's disease, uncontrolled/ill-managed diabetes, or even liver failure. I suggest you contact your care provider for a professional medical analysis.Good luck -",

            "answer": "You didn't mention how old you are. Are you menopausal? Have you had a hysterectomy?\u00a0\u00a0It may be something less related to your diabetes, than other things. I agree with the previous poster, you should go see your Dr, just to be certain that it's not something dangerous. 94 degrees is pretty low.Best of LuckT",

            "answer": "I agree with WaveRider--I've had night sweats, too, and never thought of reaching for a thermometer. If you are pre- or post-menopausal, you could be having hormonal night sweats. On the other hand, if you are a TypeII diabetic, the sweating could be a symptom of low blood sugar. So instead of a thermometer, I would be reaching for the glucose meter and checking my blood sugar level. If it is low, then eat something sweet with at least 15 grams of carb (like a couple of peppermints or 2-3 crackers). Wait 15 minutes and then test your sugars again. If they are still low, eat 15 grams of carbs again and wait the 15 minutes and check again. If still low, call your doctor or EMS, as low blood sugar that does not come up after this solution could indicate a serious problem.",
