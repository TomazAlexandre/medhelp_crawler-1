            "answer": "Normal a1c should be < 5.0, anything above 5.0 actually means that your blood sugars are not so normal (though not yet classed as diabetes).Normal fasting < 95 (though ideally in the low 80s).Normal 2 hours after eating < 120 (but ideally < 95).If your levles are even slightly high this could predispose you to yeast infections.See your dr and get some antifungal cream to address the problem.If your blood sugars are higher than absolutly normal look into eating a lower carb diet, getting to your optimal weight, and daily exercise.",

    "question": "Hello I'm a 23 year old Male uncut penis and I've noticed that I have a Yeast infection possibly again. Last year I had one so went to the doctor office and got everything checked out Blood sugar, HIV, STD test and my CBC and WBC. I came up all good. Is it possible to have a high sugar spike for about a couple of weeks where yeast growths happens and the sugar levels out afterwards? I don't have any other symptoms of Diabetes and since the last time I've seen the doctor I made a commitment to loose weight about 8 pounds. So any o you can help me understand what's going on I'm pretty darn nervous. I've made a appointment with my doctor tomorrow.",
