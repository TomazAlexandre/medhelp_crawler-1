    "question": "I am 7 months post partum and the only complaint I have had has been about my feet.\u00a0\u00a0The pain has been excruciating. Sore and tender every day and stiff after sitting for an hour or so and terrible in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0Even when I am sitting I feel them pulsating with pain.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor suggested this could be arthristis.\u00a0\u00a0I find this hard to believe.\u00a0\u00a0I am 35, arthristis has never run in my family and this has only started since my 8th month of pregnancy until now.Researching the internet I came across a forum where other women were complaining about the exact same thing with and after pregnancy. I read that the hormone relaxin makes the tendons/ ligaments soft and thus pain can arise in hands/wrists/feet.\u00a0\u00a0The hormone supposedly can last in the body for 1 year...Apart from arch supporting insoles, is there anything to be done for relief?Thank you!",
