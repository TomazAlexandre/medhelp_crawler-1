    "question": "If a patients has long term generalized edema (pitting in the legs), what are the other possible diagnostic alternatives, after heart, kidney, liver and protein abnormalities have been ruled out? I've been struggling with this edema nonsense for several years, unremitting, and yet my docs are stumped when it come to diagnosis. I also have some GI motility and hormone stuff happening but they claim there's no connection between the two.I'm 45 yr old male, no diabetes, thyroid usually normal range but flagged as mildly hyper at on few occasions, and low BP. I was very thin prior to the fluid retention, which averages between 20-30 pounds, by my estimation. I was also otherwise very healthy and active prior to these symptoms, but since becoming ill, I am often very fatigued and sleepy most days.",
