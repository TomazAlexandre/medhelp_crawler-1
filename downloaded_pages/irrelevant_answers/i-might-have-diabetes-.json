            "answer": "I would definitely go to your doctor, Kristina and get reevaluated. When you say you were tested last year and came up to be \"negative\". Do you know what the numbers were? Were you pre-diabetic (just under the line of a diagnosis)? I understand that you just want to know what is going on and you have a great attitude in being ready to accept whatever is found. If you are not diabetic, then your doctor should look further to determine what is causing your symptoms. Let us know!Zoe",

            "answer": "I have know idea what the numbers were :S they just told me that i did not have diabetes. and i thought that you could only be pre-diabetic for type 2??? because i am not overwieght or aanything i am a figure skater so i am very active, but this is getting in the way. It seems to be that, when i skate the worse my symptoms are. :( and yes i try to have a good attitude because i have alot ahead of me and i don't want this to slow me down. (: Also i find it hard to tell my mom \"hey mom, i think i have diabetes!! \" i just find it weird. i find it my doctors job to tell me whats wrong, with me. And again is it possible that you had the symptoms of type 1 before and nothing was wrong, and then they find it later ??? thanx for all your help (:",
