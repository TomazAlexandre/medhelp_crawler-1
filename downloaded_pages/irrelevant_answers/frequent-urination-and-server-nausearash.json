            "answer": "Whether you've been diagnosed with diabetes or not, a blood glucose reading of 170 is TOO HIGH!!\u00a0\u00a0And could account for most of your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure about the itchy rash (it could be completely unrelated), but definitely the increased thirst, increased urination, extreme fatigue, nausea.If you can't get in to see your primary cary physician quickly, you should go to the local ER - tell them you're experiencing symptoms (and have shown) elevated blood glucose.\u00a0\u00a0If elevated blood glucose goes untreated for too long, it can cause severe complications, so please do not put this off.\u00a0\u00a0Not only does it make you feel miserable, but can do permanent damage to your organs, sight, etc.I hope you feel better soon!Oh, one last question - are you currently on any medication?\u00a0\u00a0How/why did you think to check your blood sugar level if you're not diabetic?",

            "answer": "The reading of 170 may or may not have been a \"true\" reading - depending on what time of day you took it, what you may or may not have eaten/drank prior to taking it, how long it had been since you ate/drank anything before taking it.\u00a0\u00a0However, in my opinion, it is high enough, especially with your symptoms, to warrant checking into the possibilty of diabetes further.If you can get in to see your primary care physician relatively quicly, start there.\u00a0\u00a0They may or may not decide to refer you to either a gastroenterologist or an endocrinologist, however the primary care doc would be a really good starting place.Best of luck!",
