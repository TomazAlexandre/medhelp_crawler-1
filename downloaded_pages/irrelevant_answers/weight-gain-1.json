My baby was beautiful and healthy and I delivered vaginally and epidural free.That being said, I'd much rather not gain sixty pounds again! But I'm trying not to stress over it and just eating healthy and exercising. Don't assume that you won't be able to have a healthy baby is you gain too much!",

However I don't stress over weight gain. As long as you and baby are healthy its all good!!Plus a friend of mine who is 37 weeks didn't start gaining till around 32. Don't stress! Just make sure you keep eating well.",

            "answer": "My Dr put my weight gain limit between 15-20 lbs this pregnancy. Most people think weight gain isn't a big deal but it can be. It puts you at a higher risk for gestational diabetes, hypertension, csections, and if you do need a section you're at greater risk for post op infection. Just because it doesn't happen to everyone doesn't mean it can't happen. Also gestational diabetes is a big deal because women who develop it are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. As long as you're eating healthy and getting some exercise a little extra weight gain won't hurt. But its a very bad idea to think that just because you're pregnant you can eat whatever you want.",
