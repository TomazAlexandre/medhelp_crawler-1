            "answer": "Lots of questions and concerns, understandably! Let me start with the most important: Your visit to the doctor and the resulting \"blood test\" are unclear to me. Was it a diabetes test? If so the results being \"negative\" make no sense. What were the numbers? I would call the doctor and make sure you get the actual results, or make an appointment for follow-up, sharing your glucose meter results with him.Yes, your numbers are most definitely a cause for concern. Your weight does very much increase your risk. I know weight loss is hard. You talk about exercise but you don't mention how you eat; you need to work out a combination of the two that you can live with. There are many options for exercise when the weather is bad. You could get an exercise video, you could join a gym, buy some home exercise equipment (winters are long in Ohio, you'd use it!), even just do exercises while watching tv.Health weight loss plans can be found everywhere online. But do make sure it is a healthy weight loss plan. You are motivated to lose weight and that is great, but people who do radical diets generally can't maintain them. If you do, in fact, develop diabetes, you need to learn healthy eating you can live with ongoing. Waverider, who is on this board, can probably recommend a good site for diabetic nutrition.Most important, please do find out what is going on. I know it is hard without insurance but diabetes, unfortunately, is a very common disease and their are good doctors even in free clinics. If you have diabetes and are qualified, you might want to apply for Medicaid and/or work on getting insurance, so you can get the care you need. Good luck and let us know how you do.",

            "answer": "Zoe gave you some great advice. The unfortunate part about type 2 diabetes is that it has much greater chance of being passed from mother/father to their children than those who do not. Keep in mind there is no cure for diabetes at this time, only control. Letting it go uncontrolled will lead to cardio, kidney, and in the worse cases loss of limbs (amputation).To add to Zoe's post...1.\tCut out sugar and processed foods. It\u2019s the most important and hardest thing to do. Eat more fruits and veggies instead. Skip desert, period. Don\u2019t be tempted to munch on bad foods between meals.2.\tEat a better breakfast. Your metabolism is faster in the morning than it is later in the day. Skip the man made dry cereals for they are loaded with sugar. Instead of doughnuts, eat foods high in fiber, protein and good fats, like a veggie omelet, or oatmeal with \u00bc tsp cinnamon and handful of blueberries for the antioxidant compounds.3.\tLearn to love your veggies. Although it\u2019s contrary to many American meals, eat a main course of veggies with a small side of meat to provide the right nutritional balance.4.\tMonitor the types of foods you eat. Keep a log. Avoid those that raise your glucose.For example; ALL root vegetables (carrots, beets, radishes, etc) contain sugar and my body cannot tolerate them. I learned this through trial and error.Moderate exercise:1.\tGo for a walk after eating to help burn off excess glucose.2.\tDo some sort of moderate exercise daily or at least 3-5 times a week.Weight:1.\tYou\u2019d be surprised how much lower your glucose will be if you shed those EXTRA pounds.Some good sights on nutrition and recipes are:http://www.diabetes.org/food-nutrition-lifestyle/nutrition.jspand,http://tinyurl.com/5t5qxzThe main reason that diabetes sufferers develop skin conditions is that they have reduced nerve sensitivity and poor circulation. Most often its in the feet since the body will provide blood to your internal organs first before it does to your limbs. There are many other reasons for dark patchy skin, one is attributed to overweight. But only a Dermatologist may have the answer.You're too young to qualify for Medicare. Also, if you live under your mother's roof you're disqualified, that is, unless a doctor has declared you disabled. Search with Google for free medical clinics in your area. Post back in this thread if you further questions.",
