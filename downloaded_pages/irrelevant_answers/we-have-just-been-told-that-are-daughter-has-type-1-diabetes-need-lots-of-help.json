            "answer": "We've all been there, and don't panic, you'll be all right, and so will she. You're right, you do need lots of help, and this forum is a good place to start. I would also recommend going to Children with Diabetes, and getting involved in the closest JDRF chapter-- and getting as much information out of your medical team as possible.It is not necessary to go straight to a pump. My daughter has had diabetes for 3 1/2 years and is just now making the transition. Often newly diagnosed people have a honeymoon period, in which the blood sugars are relatively stable and respond well to insulin shots; she may do just fine on shots for a while. The pump has a high learning curve; you and your daughter have a lot to deal with right now, so it might be good to put off that extra learning curve for a year or two.I'm not aware of any foundations or grants, but insurance will often cover the cost of a pump, or most of it. Talk to your doctor about possibilities, and you may have plenty of time to wait on that, until your husband gets another job.I've been in that stressful place you're in now, dealing with this scary new disease. But she'll be fine and you will all cope. In a few months it will settle down. Hang in there and take it one challenge at a time.We're here if you have questions.",

            "answer": "I agree with wiccanshadows89 -- the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation has a staff member whose main job is to take care of issues like this. He has a wealth of information about help for those with financial issues concerning diabetes supplies. Just send a request through the Online Diabetes Support Team (ODST: the link is on the left side of their home page) and ask for this kind of information. This organization is a wonderful resource for all of us.",
