Please ask for it.",

    "question": "hi was diagnosed last year with type 2 diabetes. think I had it for about 15/20 years before that as the consultant said I had prolific diabetic retinopathy and diabetic neuropathy in my feet which was signs that I had it for a while. anyway my blood sugars are now under control so why do I feel so ill.I was registered partially sighted in January this year and have regular laser treatment to stop further loss and I can cope with that.I feel tired all the time even though I have regular B12 injections\u00a0\u00a0 and can not walk far without needing to rest and sit down. Also I go from constipation to having runs regularly. Constant indigestion and itchy skin on my back and legs now all round my mouth is red and sore. I have had quite a few dizzy spells (more feeling funny) with a headache after them. My appetite is poor but I have not lost weight although prior to diagnosis I lost loads.doctor said as my blood count was not bad 7.5 just come in 6months to see how I am then.is anyone else feeling so rough. my wife thinks I should go back before the next blood check as they are only looking at the diabetes not anything else.",
