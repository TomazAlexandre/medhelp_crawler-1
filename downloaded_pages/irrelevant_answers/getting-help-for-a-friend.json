    "question": "I have never done anything like this before but I have a dear friend named Homer who is in a desperate need of lap-band surgery. It is probably the only thing that will save his life. He is 57, has a heart as big as Texas but unfortunately a waistline to match. Very active guy who has always had a job and a number of side jobs (he raises and field trials Beagles) but his health condition has resulted in him losing his job. His insurance will not cover the surgery and his Doctor says he'll be lucky to live another 6 months. He has a family history of Diabetes, High Blood Pressure and Heart Disease. (He has them all and has already had several heart attacks). He is currently on a calorie restrictive diet and is losing weight but he is strangling on his own body fluids and it is a race that his Doctor gives him little chance of winning without surgery.He needs about 20k.\u00a0\u00a0We have raised a little over $2k but it's a drop in the bucket. /we are working on other fund raising ideas but how do we find a hospital, Physician who will do a pro bononor reduce the cost of the surgery?",
