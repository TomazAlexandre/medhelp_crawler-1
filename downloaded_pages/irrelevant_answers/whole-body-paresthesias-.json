            "answer": "Hi!Generally small nerve fiber neuropathy occurs due to an underlying disease such as diabetes, Lyme, lupus, hypothyroidism, vasculitis, alcoholism, autoimmune disorders etc. To treat this neuropathy, the underlying disease has to be kept under control. If you do not know the cause yet, then extensive tests need to be done to find the cause. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
