    "question": "I am a 35 yr old female. My life is very stressful with work, family and financial burden.I feel tired, sleepy and lack of energy all day long for many years.I have no problem doozing off. But my problem is that I will have dream non-stop the moment I doozed off. The dreams are usually similar to my daily life, e.g at work, at home and sometimes nightmares. It is so often and so real that I sometimes confused whether it is a dream or happen in real life.I feel restless eventhough I sleep at least 8 hours a day. I wanted to see a doctor but which specialist should I see?Thanks for advice",
