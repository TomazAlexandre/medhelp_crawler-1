            "answer": "Dear Brett:Your symptoms do not sound like tetnus.\u00a0\u00a0You would have severe muscle spasms, your whole body would be involved, and you would have a rigid muscle tone thorought.Systemic means that the illness is wide spread.\u00a0\u00a0So, infection would be system, as would lupus. Here the symptoms are due to a disease that is wide spread, although it may manifest as localized symptoms, i.e. joint pain.\u00a0\u00a0Localized illness such as stroke could have wide spread symptoms but the disease is located in the brain.I hope this helps.CCF Neuro MD",

    "question": "I posted a question a week ago on tingling and burning sensations that I had on my entire right side for several weeks, then it went to my entire left side and now its subsiding after several weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Now I am having generalized sharp pains that last for 10-30 seconds in various parts of my legs, feet and arms and shoulders, and the tingling and numbness are almost gone in my right side although I am worried it may come back again like it did before.I started thinking just today about when all this started and it was right around the time Hurricane Floyd flooded us out.\u00a0\u00a0We heard about the risk of tetnus if you were walking around in the flood waters at the time.\u00a0\u00a0Just a shot in the dark but I started wondering if these are possible tetnus symptons.\u00a0\u00a0I have had this problem for three months now and had CT, MRI, EKG and all were fine.\u00a0\u00a0I have an appointment with a neurologist on the 11th.Also in a lot of responses I see the word systemic used, in reference to my ordeal what is the definition of systemic??",
