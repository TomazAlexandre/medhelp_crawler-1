            "answer": "sounds exactly like derealization and panic disorder. people with depersonalization/derealization often doubt their sanity, but it always remains in tact - they never lose touch with reality. there is the possibility that you have temporal lobe epilepsy,. unfortunately, an MRI/EEG will not always spot the seizures - unless you're having them while undergoing the proceudre.the greater likelihood is that you have anxiety and depersonalization. an SSRI and benzodiazepine may be helpful. you would benefit from seeing a psychiatrist. when you get these feelings, it's best to ignore them. try to always keep busy.",

            "answer": "You may also want to have them do bloodwork for diabetes, and also an EKG to check for heart circulation.\u00a0\u00a0If those come up clear, then I think you should have a neurologist take a look at you, checking for peripheral neuropathy, which is nerve damage.\u00a0\u00a0That can cause your arm symptoms, sometimes create breathing problems, which would in turn disturb your sleep, which lack of sleep can cause your mental disconnect.",

            "answer": "Have you considered a Naturopath? Keep an open mind :)I have been suffering with neurological problems for 6 months now.\u00a0\u00a0All of my test results (MRI, EMG, SEP, lab tests, Lumbar Puncture) have came back normal.Based on the \"normal\" results, regular dr.s have labled me as having Conversion Disorder.Unfortunately, the psychiatrist was unable to find mental issues that needed addressing.I have been putting my faith into my naturopath. She truly believes I have an autoimmune condition.One thing you might try doing is changing your diet.\u00a0\u00a0I was not ready for the full \"allergy elimination diet\"\u00a0\u00a0But I am doing a version of the Swank diet.\u00a0\u00a0I eliminated red meat, dairy, sugars, just to name a few.It's been 3 weeks and I'm seeing noticable improvement!\u00a0\u00a0I'm glad to feel like me again! I could tell you a couple other things I have tried with improvement. I'd be curious to see if it helps you.Anyway, I hope you find an answer! I did have the \"breathing\" troubles you talked about - especially during physical activity, the more I did the, the worse my symptoms were.B",

    "question": "I'm having numerous problems that seem to be in a \"grey-area\" between physical and mental.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a relatively healthy, happy individual who has been experiencing bouts of muscle weakness, fatigue, and now pain and burning from elbow to fingertips.\u00a0\u00a0On top of that, I feel a weight on my chest.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing I can't live with, but I just feel as if the air around me is a little thicker and harder to breathe, if that makes sense.\u00a0\u00a0Yet for all that, what's really bothering me is what seems to be repeated losses of cognitive function.\u00a0\u00a0I'll be going along fine, next thing I know I'm completely disoriented and I can't remember what I've been saying.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I'm at my desk and things look completely strange.\u00a0\u00a0Like, I KNOW it's a stapler, but it doesn't seem connected to me or my desk.\u00a0\u00a0Or I look at my husband, and I think \"This isn't right, why am in this car with this guy?\"\u00a0\u00a0Is this a medical condition, or am I losing my mind?\u00a0\u00a0My doctor has run EEG's, MRI's and CAT scans, all normal.\u00a0\u00a0I'm starting to fear that I'm just crazy.\u00a0\u00a0And I'm frightened, because these episodes are happening more frequently, to the point where I can't perform my job and have been placed on performance warning.\u00a0\u00a0Are there other tests that could help me find a diagnosis?\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible to have a legitimate medical condition yet negative test results?\u00a0\u00a0Sorry for the loooong post....",
