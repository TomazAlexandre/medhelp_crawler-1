    "question": "In the last 8 weeks I have had 3 ovarian cysts rupture. The first two were shortly before my period started and caused intense pain which landed me in the ER. The last was yesterday, which was also painful and a trip to the ER. I haven't started my period yet but I assume I will soon. I had one other ovarian cyst rupture in my lifetime which was about 6 months after going off birth control and 6 months before getting pregnant. I have so many of the PCOS symptoms. I have ireggular periods (sometimes I will go months without one, but my \"normal\" cycles are at least 32-35 days), cysts, acne, weight gain particularly around the mid section, anxiety and possibly sleep apnea. I also find it interesting that they say that many women with PCOS will develop gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, both of which I had. I also have pre-diabetes (I am 26) and high cholesterol. All of these symptoms point towards PCOS to me. I have read some conflicting information. Some has mentioned that an ultrasound on someone with PCOS will show many small cysts. I haven't had that, I have large cysts that rupture. In fact, I had a follow up ultrasound about 3 weeks ago that showed no cysts and then yesterday in addition to the one that ruptured they found another.Does this sound like it could be PCOS? It seems to me that these cysts are definitely in relation to my menstrual period, happening shortly before I start every \"month\". I have an appointment with a specialist on Monday to get some answers but I'm curious in the meantime.Any input?",
