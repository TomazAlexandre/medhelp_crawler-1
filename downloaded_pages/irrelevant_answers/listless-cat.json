Tinsel and ribbon is one of those things a cat will eat and then suffer the consequences. It can cause severe intestinal stress and would explain why your kitty is having the holiday blues.",

            "answer": "Well, he is at an age for certain feline diseases, and the strange smell makes me wonder if it's an onset of feline diabetes (and since he's overweight...) . Over eating would possibly give your kitty a first attack if he's becoming symptomatic.Hmmm... sorry I can't be of more help. I'd suggest just keeping him warm and comfortable until tomorrow when you see the vet. Be sure he/she does the standard thyroid tests along with the others your vet will hopefully do.Keep us posted on what's happening and try to enjoy the remainder of your holiday despite what's happening.Savas (and Mrs_Savas!)",

            "answer": "Hi, I've got 2 more ideas that might have something to do with the odor!\u00a0\u00a0The first one is a ruptured abscess.\u00a0\u00a0That was my first thought when I read that you had 3 kitties.\u00a0\u00a0If they play sometimes and one of them bit him, then an infection could happen that could get into the blood stream.\u00a0\u00a0He might need antibiotics.\u00a0\u00a0The second idea, he could have a bad tooth or teeth, this would cause bad odor and loss of interest in food.I wouldn't worry about force-feeding yet if you plan on seeing the vet in a day or two, but I would force feed water if you think the cat is dehydrated.Good luck!",

            "answer": "It may be possible that he has dental problems. If the odor comes from his mouth and he doesn't even want to eat, then it may be some serious gingivitis or abscessed tooth/teeth. Chronic renal failure or diabetes may result in the onset of gingivitis. Gingivitis is a very painful condition, so maybe that's why he refuses to eat. Just a thought...Please come back with updates.",

            "answer": "All valid smells leading to valid disorders. :-)I was trying to think of one that didn't have any obvious discharges, or was coming from the mouth area. But it is possible that qricket missed some subtle specific locus for the origin of the odor. generally, an ammonia type smell from a cat is indicative of some sort of kidney malfunction and a strangely sweet smell (hard to describe this one) can indicate a sugar overload (diabetes).Of course, a person/ cat will often have that \"sick smell\" when they just have a bad cold or flu. Generally it's because the body temperature elevates, causing you to sweat, and expel \"poisons\" through the skin.I hope qricket comes back with some positive news soon.",
