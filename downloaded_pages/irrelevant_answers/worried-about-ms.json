    "question": "I had cavenous sinus thrombosis about 3 years ago which i pretty muchrecovered from. At one point i had no circulation in my head. I ended upwith diabetes insipidus as a result and am also on warfarin for life. They found no cause for this.I have also had quite bad swelling behind my eyes and my nerves dont look normal whenexamined. About 4 months ago i was rubbing my eyes (quite hard) and i noticed a blue flash.ever since then i have seen them daily. to start with they were quite far apart but they have increasedday by day and now i see them about every 5 mins. I also see phosphenes in the corners of my eyeswhen my eyes are shut, in the dark (white rings). I have been to the hospital and they dialited my puplis and lookedinside and said the retina looks ok. they discharged me but since then they have got worse. I see theblue flashes when i move my eyes they can range from pea size dots to little sparks of objects.They dont cause me any trouble in my day to day likfe i am just worried. I have been for an MRI Scanbut am waiting still on results for probably a few months. Have i damaged the optic nerve even more ?after reading your forums i am worries it could be MS. It did start with me rubbing my eyes. The blue dots dontseem to be in one eye or in the same place. Any advise ?",
