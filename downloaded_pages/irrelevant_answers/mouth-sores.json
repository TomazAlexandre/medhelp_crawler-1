            "answer": "It's still probably nothing to be concerned about.\u00a0\u00a0Alcohol can trigger canker sores if these are that. It also could be another viral infection causing mouth sores too.\u00a0\u00a0Yes it could be oral herpes but until you are seen monday it'll be too late to get an accurate culture to find that out.\u00a0\u00a0Avoid acidic foods, sour foods and alcohol for the rest of the weekend and see if that helps.Oh and avoid the chocolate bunnies - but not for mouth sore reasons - by now everyone's eaten off the ears and you are stuck trying to get your teeth thru those big thick hunks of chocolate around their middles and it hurts your teeth....he he hegrace",

South beach diet will help keep your blood sugar under control too if you were inching your way up to type 2 diabetes :)Glad you finally have answers :)grace",
