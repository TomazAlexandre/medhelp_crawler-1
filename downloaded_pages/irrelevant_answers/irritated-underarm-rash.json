I have NOT switched shaving cream, soap, deoderant, or any thing that would cause a rash like this one. I also had my blood drawn, because my doctor said that there is a skin rash that is found under the arm ( pit), and the rash is associated with diabetes. My blood work came back, and I am NOT diabetic, so the limits what the rash is even more. It is red and really soft, almost like velvet.

There are about 100 white pusticles, primarily running down both sides of my hairgrowth, mostly the size of a straight pin, some larger, covering about a two-inch square area. I have tried using antibiotic ointment and cortizone cream. Neither seem to be working. Can you tell me what this might be, and what I should put on it? I have never had this before and I am 52 years old, white male. Thank you.",

    "question": "About 5 days ago I took a shower and shaved under my arms as usual. I applied a roll on deodorant that I have just recently switched to using about a month or two ago. It often burns a little when I apply it after shaving which happened this time. Except I noticed several hours later that my left underarm was red and irritated, but there are no pimples, bumps or scales; it also does not itch. Over the next two days I did not apply any more deodorant and tried to keep the area clean and dry. But the redness and burning sensation persisted. I finally applied only one time a diluted solution of tea tree oil and some aloe vera, which burned more, so I went back to trying to let it run its course on its own. Now I have noticed in the past day that a whitish film develops on the top of the irritation. I might think that it is a yeast infection, since that area is moist since I cannot wear any thing to prevent sweat, but there is no odor like with a yeast infection or itching.I considered that this developed as a reaction to the deodorant, but now am concerned that it might be evolving into an infection -fungal? bacterial? Is there anything I should be doing or over the counter medicine I could try before going to a doctor?",
