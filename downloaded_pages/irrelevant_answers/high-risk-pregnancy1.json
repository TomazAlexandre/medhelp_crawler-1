    "question": "Anybody else on here a high-Risk pregnancy like myself?? It is scary at tines..could use someone to talk to. I'm 20 weeks..due June 30th. But they will start testing at the end of my eighth month, which is may 5th, that is eight weeks early, to take the baby out as soon as possible for my health. So..in my case I'm over my half way mark. Only 32 weeks of pregnancy to expect..coulder be sooner than that or later..depending on how mine and the baby's health is doing. And things are starting to get scary when it has been perfect until now..my body is struggling. I'm only 22 and in heart failure..I gave a genetic autoimmune disease",
