Did anyone from your family experience these symptoms before?The lower extremity pain may or may not be related to the other symptoms. The memory loss and slurred speech, in itself, could point to many conditions, such as stroke or MS, among others.\u00a0\u00a0Consult a neurologist at the earliest possible time.",

    "question": "For 2 years now, I've had pain in my feet, and lower legs.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes in lower back.\u00a0\u00a0The pain can get severe, and is aching, burning, tightening, pulsing.\u00a0\u00a0I had an MRI and it showed minimal disc herniation. Had Physical therapy/steroid injections.\u00a0\u00a0Didn't help the leg pain at all.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors went on to a plantar fasciitis diagnosis, and gave me orthotics, steroid injections, and physical therapy.\u00a0\u00a0It didn't help.\u00a0\u00a0I go through periods where I think I'm getting better, and then everything gets worse again.\u00a0\u00a0I have had depression on and off for many years, and am now being told that\u00a0\u00a0the symptoms are basically not real and must be the depression.\u00a0\u00a0My depression has been managed for years, and was never associated with pain before.\u00a0\u00a0It is true, that I am now depressed, but it was only after 15 months of pain with no relief.\u00a0\u00a0I have to start out all my many, many doctor appointments with \"I'm not looking for drugs, and I'm not making this up...\"\u00a0\u00a0that in itself if depressing.I've also had an EMG for my back that was normal, and another EMG looking for tarcel tunnel which was normal.Other symptoms that have been more and more noticeable, but I'm not sure are related, are speech problems... like coming up with words takes too long and it's frustrating... every day it happens several times a day.\u00a0\u00a0My family notices it too.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not able to retain things as well... I had to drop a class I was taking because one thing built upon another (math) I would learn one operation, and then not be able to apply it to another.\u00a0\u00a0I would forget it.I keep getting this weird test and am asked to remember three things like a pencil, cloud, house... then when I can do it, my word finding difficulties are discounted.\u00a0\u00a0Those are general memory things that if I concentrate on in a very short period of time, I can remember.\u00a0\u00a0It's trying to find a word that I need to say... or remember a detail from the day before... I also tend to jumble words, and occasionally say words almost slurred.\u00a0\u00a0And again, my family notices it too, not just me.If you have any suggestions, I would definitely welcome them.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, Bob",
