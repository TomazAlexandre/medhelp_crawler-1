            "answer": "Hello,The two important causes of dizziness are hypoglycemia(low bld sugar) and orthostatic hypotension(low Bp).Pls get your BP and blood sugar levels evaluated.Also get your electrolytes and mineral levels evaluated.Drink plenty of water as dehydration can lead to electrolyte imbalance which in turn can lead to low BP and hence hypothermia and dizziness.Other causes of dizziness include lack of sleep, cervical spodolysis, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, transient ischemic attack( TIA),stroke and drugs like antihypertensivs, nitroglycerin and diuretics.Can you identify any of these.Get yourself examined by an eye specialist too as dizziness can also be caused by refractory changes and changes in the power of accommodation of the eyes. Ear infections and other causes like Meniere\u2019s disease or inner ear diseases can also lead to dizziness.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep us posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Okey dokey. Your symptoms are not typical of diabetes. One problem with diabetes is that when the body goes into a high sugar situation, the body draws excessive water from the blood, causing dehydration. The dehydration, in turn, causes blood to clot in tiny vessels. This can cause stroke.\u00a0\u00a0It is important for a diabetic to remain hydrated. That being said, you need an evaluation NOT at a diabetic clinic but at a stroke specialty center. The symptoms you describe are clearly neurological in nature.",
