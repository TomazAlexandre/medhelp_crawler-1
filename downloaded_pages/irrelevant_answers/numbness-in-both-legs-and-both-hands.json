            "answer": "Hi there. Your neurologist is right about the MS related numbness, which will be characteristically constant. You need to rule out degenerative disc disease ( cervical) with possible central canal stenosis causing the myelopathy and lower limb symptoms. Get an MRI spine done to check for intervetrebral disc prolapse or age related degeneration. It is good that other systemic illnesses like diabetes and hypertension are ruled out. Treatment would depend on the cause, which if being disc prolapsed would require urgent decompressive surgery. Get in touch with your neurologist at the earliest. Hope this helps. Take care.",

    "question": "Hello,I was wondering if anyone knows what's wrong with me!!!\u00a0\u00a0I am 45, have been diagnosed with MS 4years ago...and have very little symptoms (usually).\u00a0\u00a0I do take Copaxone shots and Zoloft for depression.\u00a0\u00a0Lately, I have been getting numbeness in both my fee (usually from knee down) and both hands (from elbows down).\u00a0\u00a0It started at night time when I was sleeping.\u00a0\u00a0It used to be a few times a week..and then almost every night and for the past 3days, it seems like it's non-stop.\u00a0\u00a0When I move my hands and feet, the numbness gets slightly better.\u00a0\u00a0I also half calf pain (both legs).....The numbness is pretty bad at night..and I wake up from it several times..and have to move to feel better for a few minutes.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have diabeties, cholestoral, or blood pressure issues and aside from MS, I am in a pretty good health.\u00a0\u00a0The past three days, I feel really tired and extremly low in energey too.\u00a0\u00a0I went to my doctor today and she is going run some tests but she doesn't think it's circulation issues...(but for some reason, I do!)...Does this ring a bell for anyone?...Oh..btw, I have checked with my Neurologist and he doesn't think this is MS related at all (becuase sometimes the numbness goes away with movement, and MS numbness does not).\u00a0\u00a0If you know anything about this, I would appreciate any feedback.",
