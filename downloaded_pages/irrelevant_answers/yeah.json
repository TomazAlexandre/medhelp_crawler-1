    "question": "I haven't posted in about three weeks because I had finals to concentrate on, but I just thought I post today to share my news......I got 2 lines!!!!!!!!!Totally unexpected and I found out on accident, I had taken a test on Sat morning and it was neg so, I wrapped it up and was going to throw it away,but forgot. Yesterday while I was doing laundry i went to throw it out and it feel out of the bag and there was a faint line in the test area($tree brand). I was floored and I had to make sure my eyes weren't playing tricks. Oh when I took the test I didn't wait the 4-10mins. I threw it away as soon as the control line showed up. Anywho took another yesterday and another this morning and they were both positive!",
