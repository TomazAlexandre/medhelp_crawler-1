These drugs may interfere with blood glucose control because they can cause hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, new-onset diabetes mellitus, and/or exacerbation of preexisting diabetes.MANAGEMENT: Close clinical monitoring of glycemic control is recommended if these drugs are coadministered with antidiabetic agents. Likewise, patients should be observed for hypoglycemia when these drugs are withdrawn from their therapeutic regimen. Dose adjustments of the hypoglycemic agent may be required.Best wishes ... and see your doc ... k?\u00a0\u00a0;p",

    "question": "I am a 30 year old male who is 6' 5\" tall and have been close to 350 lbs for many years now. I have type 2 diabetes and was diagnosed with thyroid cancer so am also taking Levothyroxine daily and Novolog insulin. My question is: Would any of these diseases contribute to sudden weight loss? I have been close/over 350 lbs for years, but in the last several months I have dropped a significant amount of weight. I'm down to 287. (20 lbs in the last four weeks alone.) I wish I could say it's because I'm exercising or eating right... but I'm not. I've made no change to physical activity or diet. Any suggestions?",
