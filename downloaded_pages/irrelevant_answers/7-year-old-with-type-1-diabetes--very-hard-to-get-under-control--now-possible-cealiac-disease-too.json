            "answer": "My strong advice to you is to see a pediatric endocrinologist. Regular doctors (PCP) are ill-equipped often to deal with type 1 diabetes. Your doctor has your daughter on a very outdated regimen of insulin. She should be on a combination of basal (long-acting once or twice a day) and bolus insulin (fast acting) before each meal, not with a set dose but with doses determined to cover she is actually about to eat. In addition to seeing an endo (which I know may take awhile), you could get the book Using Insulin by John Walsh, and if you send me a PM I will give you the name of a website with many other experienced diabetics including parents. Your doctor is expecting results, but not giving you the right tools!",

            "answer": "I just looked up Novorapid and see it is the same thing as Novolog which I'm more familiar with. That IS a bolus insulin and so that is what she should have before her meals. But a set dose doesn't work nearly as well as a dose determined by counting carbs. Also, it makes absolutely no sense that she takes fast acting insulin for breakfast and dinner but not lunch and even snacks if they include significant carbs. Without it she will be inevitably high after those meals. See an endo!",

    "question": "My daughter is 7 and 8 months ago was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. She is on 4 shots a day, 2 with breakfast which is Insulatard ( 9 units ) and 3 and half units of Novorapid. She gets 2 units of Novorapid with evening meal and 2 units of Insulatard with bedtime snack. We are finding it very difficult to bring her sugars down within her target range. Her target is between 4-7mmoh/L but her sugar readings especially at evening meal time is often over 15mmoh/L anytime we increase the morning doses (as advised by her peadiatrician) she goes low before lunch time in school, this happens for a few days so they pull back the increase again. It seems to be a constant pattern. Just recently she went for her 3 monthly check and her hbA1c came in at 9.3 which is high.The doctor said she wants it to come down by the next time we go back which is end of next month. I have tried my best to get it down to no avail. The doctor said her blood tests also suggest she is developing cealiac disease. I'm finding it all a little too much. I feel so sorry for my daughter that she can't have her usual foods or treats like our other children or her friends with being diabetic and I know this upsets her I don't know how she will be if she does end up with cealiac as the doctor said alot of her food will be restricted even further.? Any help or advice/tips would help alot thanks",
