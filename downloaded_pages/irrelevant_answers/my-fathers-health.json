            "answer": "I think it's a good idea that he's seeing a Cardiologist. There might be some heart problems going on ,even if the EKG says that everything is okay. I'm not saying that an EKG is not a very good test, but sometimes people need further testing to find out what's going on.",

            "answer": "here is my suggestion; 2 things1. forget about back surgery; instead buy and read a bk;. author Dr. John Sarno (written many decades ago and revised many times)WHY; because hundreds of thousands report being healed by OMG u won't want to believe this but it is true; they read the book, no surgery, no meds, no therapy etc. and never met the good Dr. (u can get it in couple days under 20 bucks amazon) title HEALING back pain2. go to a vitamin store and tell them u want the super highest culture count probiotics so to give dad 200 BILLION cultures daily x 1 mo, then 100 x 1 month, then 50 and stop and stay at 25 billion culture counts daily (not million and this is why u need a vitamin store)IN ALL SURGERIES u would be hard pressed to find a higher failure rate than back surgery so he should not be in a hurry for that. (it is like sending a drunk to AA, sounds good but 95% FAIL)ALSO add flaxseed oil 3 tablespoons daily (tastes like crap so gently dump down back of throat away from taste buds at the front of tongue and\u00a0\u00a0quickly eat tiny piece of pickle to rid any after taste.)drink water 6 glasses daily TAP IS BEST, never purifiedsince family has Diabetes, borrow a kit and have him check first thing in morning before eating anything, OVER 130 get checked\u00a0\u00a0normal is 80 to 100u can also have him eat a bunch of sugar items like candy and re-check 30 minutes later as a person in good shape will not really have any difference but if u see a number jump of say 50 or more have it checkednow diet; no fried food, no snack junk, no prepackaged junk from storeeat veggies, fruit, skinless chicken, fish (not fried)in 1 week u will know if this helps and it may help greatlywish u luck",

    "question": "I'm posting this about my 58-yr-old retired father who has the doctors stumped on his condition.\u00a0\u00a0A little history: he has psoriasis, degenerative discs in the back with severe nerve damage in the legs, high blood pressure (regulated with meds), and baret's asophogus. He recently had vascular surgery to his left leg with good results and will eventually have back surgery.\u00a0\u00a0But, it's been months since the surgery and his left foot has suddenly become very swollen.\u00a0\u00a0It's cold to touch and numb.\u00a0\u00a0Since he'd just went back on a blood-thinner, his doctor decided they'd just monitor it and see if the swelling would stop on its own.\u00a0\u00a0But, it's been about two weeks with no change.\u00a0\u00a0The doc did blood work and noticed that my dad's blood sugar was high and scheduled another blood test.\u00a0\u00a0And, more importantly, my dad has been having severe chest pains and left arm and shoulder pains.\u00a0\u00a0An EKG was normal.\u00a0\u00a0The pains come and go.\u00a0\u00a0This happened once before, years ago, which was when he was diagnosed with barots asophogus, which he's been treated for with meds ever since and has had no repeated attacks until now.\u00a0\u00a0It's disheartening that his family doc doesn't know what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0He's scheduled a stress test (which my dad has done before with normal results) and an appointment with a cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have a clue what this is?\u00a0\u00a0I might add that the meds he takes currently are for high blood pressure, blood-thinning, barots asophogus, gabapentin, and a shot for psoriasis.\u00a0\u00a0He's a heavy smoker and drinks a lot of beer.\u00a0\u00a0Family history of diabetes, lung cancer, throat cancer.",
