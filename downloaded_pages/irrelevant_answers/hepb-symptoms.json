    "question": "SUP? Does hepB come along with any symptoms like really loose stools, episcleritis (inflammation of the white part of the eye), and pain on my right side.\u00a0\u00a0My test results both show antibodys and antigen to hepB both (-) at 6 months after exposure but im still kind of nervous why i have these symptoms...... You think they could be something else, im totally overlooking? It was my first time ever having sex, so what is the chances of getting hepB anyways in the US? Isnt it very uncommon? thanks",
