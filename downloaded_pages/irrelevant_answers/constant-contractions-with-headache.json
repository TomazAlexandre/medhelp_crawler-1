            "answer": "Go get yourself checked out. I I know its frustrating to have to go when it's been nothing in the past, but it's better to be safe than sorry. 33 weeks is way too early should you wait and labor progresses. It could just be braxton hicks but do you and a baby a favor and just pop in to be checked out just in case :)",

            "answer": "I noticed you asked this question on a different account earlier around two hours ago. If you've been having frequent contractions for 4 hours, it's vital you be looked at. You could easily be in pre-term labour and at 33 weeks it is far too early for baby to come. You should have gone in as soon as they told you to, regardless of how much you might not want to. It's not about how you feel, it's about the health of the baby.",
