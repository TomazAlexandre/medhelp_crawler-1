            "answer": "Hello,Such type of sensations can be due to parasthesia skin which are commonly due to nerve conditions and spinal cord conditions. Also other possibilities include diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis and underactive thyroid. Abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body and a lack of vitamin B12 can also cause such sensations.You can take multivitamins for some time. Also get your blood sugar tested.My opinion is to get yourself examined by a neurologist. After confirmatory diagnosis only, treatment can be started.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
