            "answer": "Hi Grace, thanks for your reply. Yes they did a glucose serum random which was normal.I should also add that when they did the ultra sound, my bladder had 670ml urine before voiding and 150 ml urine after voiding. Im wondering if this could mean I have a bladder problem rather then a prostate problem.",

    "question": "Hi, I am 33 year old healthy male STD free.I have been experiencing the urge to urinate at least once at night, I have had a white semen like discharge from the penis, stinging sensation while urinating and discomfort in the urethra.Doctor has prescribed cipro 500mg 2x a day for about a month because he feels it might be a prostate infection. Urine tests at lab show no infection however dipstick testing at clinic show white blood cells in urine, proteins and pus. I have done an ultra sound of the urinary tract and shows prostate to be of normal size. 2 weeks have passed since on the cipro and so far the stinging when urinating has eased however the discomfort in the urethra is still present and I still wake up at night to pee. I was wondering does this sound like NGU? Should doxycycline be the antibiotic I should be on instead of cipro or does cipro also cure NGU? I have about 2 more weeks of the antibiotics to go before I see the doctor again however I just wanted some advice so I can be prepared in case my symptoms dont resolve.Thanks!",
