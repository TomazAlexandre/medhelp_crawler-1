            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Cardiolipin antibody testing is typically ordered when it is suspected that the person is liable for thrombotic episodes like deep vein thrombosis. If cardiolipin antibodies are detected, then the test is usually repeated at least 6 weeks later to help determine whether their presence is persistent or temporary. So, you can repeat your test to know the status.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "Hello. I am 25 years old, female and have so many symptoms and no doctor has yet to diagnos me. I am curious if anyone can help me out here. It all started about two years ago with these tiny little bumps showing up on my arms that where itchy, and after being out in the sun during the summer. My PCP at the time just gave me some steroid cream to get rid of them and wasn't really sure what it was. After that I had muscle pain in my legs and joints, so bad it hurt going up stairs or doing anything active. This would come and go but never lasted too long. Over the past two years i've experienced night sweats, shortness of breath, nausea, muscle weakness the worst in my legs, general weakness all over, extremley tired but cant seem to sleep well at night or ever feel rested. The past few months I have felt my worst here are the symptoms I have been having. Muscle twitching/spasms all over-mostly in legs, leg muscles are sore, tight feeling sometimes have a burning sensation. headaches, light sensitive, no appetie, horse voice, irritablitity, anxiety, random heart fluttering, dizziness, light headed, dry mouth, nauseas, stiff legs and hips, pain in hips and lower back,. itchy red bumps that show up randomly and rashes. The left side of my body is also weaker than the right and i have tingling and some numbness on the left side.\u00a0\u00a0I have scoliosis and have had endometriosis.",
