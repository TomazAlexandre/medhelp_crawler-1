            "answer": "The test needs to be done accurately as if you have gestational diabetes and you don't know and don't test your blood..follow certain diet etc might need medication then it could harm your baby. I'm site you have to do as they say for a reason. Trust me I'm sure you'd rather take the test than test your bloods four times q day. You have to do that anyway if you're diagnosed. Ask them for q different flavour but its v important for you and more so your baby that you find out. I had gestational diabetes. Good luck xx",

            "answer": "Regarding the flavors they did switch them for me but not really for me it was actually because the higher dose of the sugar drink which they give you in the second test is in a different flavor. The first test was supposed to be like orange soda and the second test was in fruit punch. I thought the first was bad but I was wrong the fruit punch was like sugar on crack. It gave me an immediate headache and made me nauseous which is why I ended up throwing up. I hardly ever eat sugary foods and almost always eat organic food or food that is free from preservatives and extra sugar or add ins. I eat lots of fruit and when I eat meat its usually white meat chicken or fish. Could I really have diabetes eating that healthy? My mom never had it and shes SUPER overweight with all of her pregnancies.",

            "answer": "I'm afraid you can be the healthiest eater and skinny and still get it. Being overweight just increases your chances.. isn't a symptom as such. It's to do with your body and how it handles insulin. I had it and only gained 7lb during my pregnancy. I'm afraid the test is the only way. If you have it and don't get diagnosed or treated tour baby could become Farr too big or other problems.Just get it over and done with for your baby. The three hour glucose tolerance test was the only way of finding out. Trust me. Xx",

I REALLY hope that I don't have it :P What happens to the baby if you do have it besides the baby getting big? What kind of special diet do they put you on? Is it completely different than what eating healthy is already like or what?",

My friend said she kelt missing her appointment (on purpose) and just kept rescheduling cause she didn't want to take it. And she never did end up taking it. You could try that, just keep missing the appointment lol. But honestly i don't know if the doctors can refuse to see you or not. Im sure it was just the food. But if you can tough it out one more time, maybe its just best to get it over with? Good luck!",

I think. If you which drs the new Dr is gonna ask you too do it since the other drs results are inaccurate. Ask if there's a diffrent method, I read on here not long ago that a womans Dr gave her jelly beans instead of the drink. I know it tastes awful I can't stand anything too sweet, with my son I threw up the first time, then rescheduled it failed it and had to do the 3hour one. This time I forced that stuff down and passed it the first time. It's not a matter of them being understanding about what you ate before hand , but they need the results to be more accurate to know if they need to put you on a special diet for your and your babys well being.",

AND talk to your Dr! tell him/her that your afraid youll just keep getting sick, see if there are other opitons... like someone else said there are other flavors and from being on here there are actually jelly beans you can eat instead of the drink.... maybe they would be willing to order you in somehting else if they dont normally carry other flavors...yes most woman pass the test and all is good but they test you because there is a chance you can have it and a lg baby is just one of the risks... look into it... for my 1 hour test with my last pregnancy i ate before(here your allowed) and failed and so i didnt eat before for this pregnancy and failed the test again.... i passed the second tests each time...but because you did fail... even just a tiny bit you still need to know for sure....if you are choosing to live like you have it then its even more important you do your researchAnd here regarless of the strength of glucose they only have orange flavor... and honestly i thought the second stronger drink tasted better than the first, it was easier to get down for me...",

They don't offer jelly beans at the clinic I go to and they changed the flavor but only because the stronger sugar drink for the 3hr test only came in a fruit punch flavor which I thought was worse than the first one. I will do research on GD now and am not trying to go out of my way to hurt my baby or myself or be irresponsible. I just can't handle the sugary drink I normally never eat or drink sugary things so fasting for 12 hours and then drinking straight sugar didn't settle well with me. I want whats best for me and my baby and if I have to I will go on the special diet and take my blood four times a day.",

You so need the test and if you test positive you will be seen more.. scanned more to.check size of baby and see a diabetic team and doetixian. So it is important . There is no one with it in my family and it usually goes away after having baby it did with me. Yheres nothing you can do to perevent it you will either get it or you won't. Good luck xx",

    "question": "Ok so I took my first glucose test and ate a couple of hours before the test (naughty I know but I felt like I was going to pass out from hunger) and I had a piece of bread a small piece of cheese and about a cup of apple sauce. Needless to say I failed my first test. However I told them that I ate a little bit so they made me wait three hours longer to test and I did wait. So my levels only came out BARELY over what they wanted. So they wanted to do another test basically for protocol. I went in to do the second test and RIGHT when I was just about finished with that nasty sugar water I threw up :'( the phlebotemist was all grumpy and irritated with me and I cried cause I felt bad and didn't want to take the test again. Anyways my question is is do you think that my clinic could refuse to see me anymore if I don't comply with taking the glucose test again? I KNOW that if I do it again I'm just going to keep throwing up and I don't see why they can't just be understanding and think about the fact that I ate beforehand and thats why my levels were a little high. Why can't they just be merciful and let me either do the first test again-not take it at all and understand that it was the food- or let me take my blood sugar levels for a week and then determine that I am not diabetic. They told me that I either have to take the second test again or take my blood sugar four times a day for the rest of my pregnancy. So again I know patients have the right to refuse tests and stuff but can they refuse to see me anymore because I wont do the second test again? Sorry its so long but I just wanted to explain the situation. Thanks for the help :)",
