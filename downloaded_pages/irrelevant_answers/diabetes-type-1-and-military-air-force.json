    "question": "I've just found out I have diabtes type 1. I'm in the Air Force and I've been in just over a year. I'm a loadmaster, which means I'm a flyer. Type 1 is an automatic DNIF ( duty not including flying ) Which means I can't fly ever again in the air force. I'm looking at a medical discharge, but I dont know if my medical, or GI BILL will be taken care of when I get out. Any info will be helpful. Thanks",
