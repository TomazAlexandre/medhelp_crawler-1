            "answer": "Please, you should stop with the steam room. The baby can't regulate body heat. We shouldn't be using, jacuzzis, taking hot baths, using steam room/saunas, etc.Increasing water intake sounds good. I weight train and typically get in a gallon or more a day.I think I read the other day they high bp could affect the flow too... Yours sounds normal, at least for resting (both similar). Maybe prolonged elevated bp since you're very active as a fitness instructor isn't helping. Can you tone down your portion of the workout if the increase in fluid intake isn't helping?",

            "answer": "For the steam room I don't stay as long in there as I used to which was like 15 min.... Now its like 5. It's.just that I feel bone chilling cold if I don't do long hot shower and a steam. The weather is heating up so ill skip it entirely. My ob booked another ultrasound at 22 weeks to monitor this so ill see if the water consumption helps. I'm trying to do 2.5 x 1.5 L bottle.The birthweight of my first child was 6.9 which was on the low side at 41 weeks. They said blood flow issues can cause low birth weight. Maybe I had this condition last time too. I used a midwife so technology is pretty non existent. Ended off with a c.section cuz all my amino disappeared",
