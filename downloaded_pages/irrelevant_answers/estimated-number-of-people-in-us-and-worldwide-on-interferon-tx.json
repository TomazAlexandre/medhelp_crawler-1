            "answer": "Of course they give it away. What else can you do, when you spend billions developing a drug and most of the people who need it can't afford it? You take the write off, and bless them for doing so. They could just as easily have decided the sx and liabilities were too steep and taken it off the shelf.",

            "answer": "Clearly reason and history demonstrates that corporate america plays any marketing game they can.\u00a0\u00a0Revenire is not paranoid, he is using reason and he humbly mentioned paranoid.\u00a0\u00a0Prices for drugs in the US are so much more than in Canada.\u00a0\u00a0It costs just as much to make the drugs regardless of where you market it.\u00a0\u00a0Revenire's point is that it is not \"black or white\" whether drug companies are good or bad...etc; he is just stating a \"gray\" side, a fact that corporate greed exists, not that the \"white\" side of corporate america does not also exist.\u00a0\u00a0We can get tangled up in that polemic.\u00a0\u00a0I would rather spend time sharing with each other to find out if anyone knows the answer to the question.I for one do not think the drug corporations want us to know what huge profit they are making, so the answer to this question is not available.\u00a0\u00a0I for one think they do a few hand outs for the public relations to make them look good so they can perpetuate their bonanza.\u00a0\u00a0But, sure, there is a good side of the corporate contribution.\u00a0\u00a0There has to be in order for us to give them the big bucks.",

Look at how long they waited to admit there were problems with agent orange. I know vets who died while waiting for help from the Vets. I suggest those who are still too naive to consider these things watch the movie, Jacobs Ladder.",

Next time I see my hep doc I'll ask, he is a researcher, teaches and publishes (HCV and diabetes mostly).\u00a0\u00a0G.AN ASIDE: Strange how a few \"members\" deviate from the topic all the time and get so confrontational.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe the other \"community\" forum is a good idea to battle ideology issues over there.\u00a0\u00a0Too much drama in going through this hell without stirring it up.\u00a0\u00a0Need more positive tone and encouragement, not controversy.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry for the rant!",
