            "answer": "She's getting an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test, to rule out diabetes.She should also be\u00a0\u00a0tested for Candida-her symptoms are consistent with Candida-, something that doctors don't usually look for. Beware that sometimes it's missed in their testing.You may look into having her do a screening self-test for Candida.Search under \"Saliva test for Candida\".Should she indeed get diagnosed with Candida, I think a PEG urine testmight be the next\u00a0\u00a0logical\u00a0\u00a0step (along with a comprehensive anti-candida protocol), to rule out Leaky Gut Syndrome, a common consequence ofuntreated Candida.I hope this helps.Niko",
