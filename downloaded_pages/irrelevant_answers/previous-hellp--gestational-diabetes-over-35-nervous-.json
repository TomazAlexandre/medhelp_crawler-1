I cut out all pop,juice and white bread etc. I am 23 wks tomorrow and I have lost 20 lbs and my baby is healthy. I say now that ur pregnant and know u have had problems in the past, that u can change ur life style sooner and get control of it or better yet not have it at all.I got checked early on for diabeties so im guessing that's what they are going to do this time around with you. Good luck I hope this helps",
