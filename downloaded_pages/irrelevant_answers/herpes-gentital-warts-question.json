            "answer": "You have been given accurate information about HPV; symptomatic HPV infection (genital warts, etc) can show up several months after exposure.\u00a0\u00a0But you probably have already been infected with HPV anyway; over 80% of all people who have had 4 or more lifetime sex partners have been infected with HPV.\u00a0\u00a0The vast majority of infections are asymptomatic, never causing recognized warts or other problems.\u00a0\u00a0In other words, look at genital HPV infection as inevitable, not generally an important health risk, definitely not worth losing sleep about it.As far as herpes is concerned, many HSV infections are asymptomatic and remain that way. But the risk is very low from any single episode of sex with a random partner, and I agree with your dermatologist that there is no particular reason to be tested for it in the absence of symptoms.I don't recommend further testing for any STD.\u00a0\u00a0However, 3 months is the officially accepted standard for HIV.\u00a0\u00a0If you remain anxious about that possibility, you might want to be tested one more time.\u00a0\u00a0The result will be negative.Good luck--\u00a0\u00a0HHH, MD",

            "answer": "Good question.\u00a0\u00a0What explains the apparent discrepancy between overall HIV epidemiology and my responses to questions about HIV acquisition risk?1) Probably most important is that people at high risk don't ask questions here; websites like this tend to attract the worried well.\u00a0\u00a0And internet users tend to be educated and, on average, better off economically than society's average--strong predictors of lower HIV risk.\u00a0\u00a0So I get questions from people with 5 seconds of pentration, or protected sex (maybe with condom slippage at the end), or brief oral sex without ejaculation, and all of this mostly from people who describe partners that do not seem to be at high risk.\u00a0\u00a0This forum gets few questions from people who account for most cases of HIV/AIDS in this country, such as the wives or girlfriends repeatedly exposed to an injection drug using partner or a guy on the downlow; gay men repeatedly having unprotected sex with multiple partners of unknown HIV status; inner-city, drug using commercial sex workers (or their pimps); and so on.2) Even in fairly high risk settings, the risk of HIV transmission is low for any single exposure--so individual reassurance over any particular event usually is warranted.3) Oral sex is inherently low risk.\u00a0\u00a0If you could magically make genital and anal sex disappear, to be replaced entirely by fellatio and cunnilingus, HIV/AIDS almost certainly would cease to be a problem; the efficiency of transmission is not high enough to sustain transmission in any population.\u00a0\u00a0In contrast, I have repeatedly advised people that there is a risk of gonorrhea from oral sex (but apparently not chlamydia).There are other, more complex epidemiologic explanations as well; and the situation varies widely across populations around the world.\u00a0\u00a0In any case, all I can do on this site is weigh the risks based on what people ask.\u00a0\u00a0To the best of my ability, I give a straightforward assessment of the likelihood they acquired HIV.HHH, MD",

I was surprised at how (overly) conservative their advice is, especially given how low risk most posters there are.I was especially surprised to read the response to someone's question about whether HIV wasn't like diabetes, i.e. just another a chronic illness. The doctor replied that HIV was far more serious, because diabetes is a manageable chronic illness while new side effects and new strains of HIV are always emerging. That may be true, but I disagree overall. I really like this analogy, because I think it actually highlights the unrealistic views people have of various diseases and health risks. A LOT more people (in this country, anyway) have *unmanaged* diabetes, and a LOT more of them are facing some pretty significant serious consequences. Vascular damage, heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, blindness, you name it. And a lot of them are dying from complications of unmanaged diabetes - far more than the number of people dying each year in the US from HIV. I'm not a doctor, but just comparing those two illnesses, I'd think most people are MORE at risk from diabetes than HIV.So I just went to look, and here you go:20.8 million people",

            "answer": "Lol. No, it's a GREAT analogy. My point is that most people on this board are at virtually no risk of contracting HIV, but at significant risk of developing an equally serious chronic illness. So which do they worry about? I don't get it.But if you don't like my diabetes analogy because of the contagion issue, how about the flu? Every year about 36,000 people in the US die from the flu (CDC)... more than double the annual deaths from HIV in the US.If you really want to be healthy, take reasonable precautions. Don't smoke, eat a mostly (if not entirely) vegetarian, lowfat diet, exercise regularly. Wear your seatbelt. Use smoke detectors in your house. Use condoms regularly for vaginal and anal intercourse. Talk to your partners about their STD histories and get tested regularly. Work to accept yourself as you are - and that includes your sexuality.",

I just checked it out, and here is the main paragraph in its entirety:\"As for testing the source of an exposure, it can be helpful in some situations occupational exposures for health care workers, for example. However, considering the estimated transmission risk statistics for exposures like yours, it would not make sense. The estimated per-act risk for acquiring HIV from unprotected insertive oral with a partner confirmed to be HIV positive is 0.5 per 10,000 exposures. Your estimated risk would have been even less because you did not know the HIV serostatus of your \"worker.\" With risk statistics like that, whether the source was positive or not, testing would not make sense on multiple levels.\"That risk is with someone who is CONFIRMED HIV positive, not someone whose status you don't know. And you can't possibly be serious when you suggest that these are bad odds. I think it bears noting that those odds basically translate to one in over FIFTY YEARS of giving oral once a day, every day, to someone who is HIV positive. Put it into perspective.
