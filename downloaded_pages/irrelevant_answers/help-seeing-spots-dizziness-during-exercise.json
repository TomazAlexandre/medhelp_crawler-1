    "question": "For the past month or so, whenever I exercise I'll see these bright colored spots in my vision (they look somewhat like afterimages) and start to feel lightheaded.Sometimes my vision will even blur and I'll get extremely dizzy. I was sick for two weeks a little while ago with some sinus infection, if that makes a difference.I'm a teenager and I've been an athlete all my life, so I have no idea why this is happening. Any ideas what this could be from?",
