            "answer": "Hi, Jae. I am a podiatrist and agree that it certainly sounds like you are suffering from plantar fasciitis ( or calcaneal enthesitis as is now considered more accurate!). However, those not in the know do not delve deeply enough into the problem.This condition is largely caused by malfunction of the subtalar joint - a crucial joint of the foot just below the ankle which is responsible for governing most of the movents of the joints of the feet. You probably suffer from severe pronation of this joint, which causes flattening of the arch and thus excessive stress on the plantar fascia.This in turn results in the symptoms of inflammation you appear to be experiencing. A vicious cycle ensues, and if the root cause (ie: the subtalar joint pronation) is not addressed, it will not resolve.Subtalar joint pronation can be prevented by wearing orthotics, which your podiatrist should be able to sort out for you. However, there are several items of footwear available these days which incorporate anti-pronatory devices, ( I am thinking of trainers, etc) so you may be able to get some of those in the meantime. Don't despair - you do NOT have to give up your physical activity! Bear in mind, though, that the inflammation will not resolve until the pronation is addressed. Anti inflammatories may well be useful whilst healing is taking place. Good luck!",

    "question": "8 months ago I had my 3rd child. I lost most of my baby weight and seemed to be doing well working on losing some extra I had put on after child #2 and never got rid of, I had my tubes tied the day I delivered my 3rd child, and things seemed to be okay; but then I started getting foot pain after my son was about 2 months old, and I noticed that the weight I had lost came back fast. I had not changed my diet or my routine. The foot pain is more towards the heel, it's more intense in my left foot but both feet hurt. It's horrible first thing in the mornings, and after I\u2019ve been sitting for long periods of time then get up to walk. The more I walk on it the less it hurts and after awhile it's bearable to walk, but I am still in a LOT of pain.I thought at first it was due to my exercise.\u00a0\u00a0I do a 1 hr workout video daily (walk away the pounds the 2 mile) and walk about 4 miles every evening at a good pace. I started my work out at on the 30 min 1 mile workout for 6 weeks, im currently on my 3 week of mile 2 and will continue it for a total of 8 weeks, then move to the 3 mile for 10 weeks. I started my evening walk at 2 miles, but increased that because my dogs needed a longer walk. In all this time I\u2019ve only lost about 5 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0*oh and im currently BF my 3rd child it doesn't seem to have helped me lose any weight either*Of my 3 pregnancies I\u2019ve had gestational diabetes the last 2 pregnancies. I was prescribed glyburide the last 3 months of my 2nd pregnancy and the last 6 of my 3rd pregnancy. I continue to monitor my blood sugar and watch my diet.im sorry this is all so long winded but I\u2019ve heard that diabetes can cause foot pain and I want to make sure my whole history of this is listed.I also have asthma and take medication for that (but that isn't a cause of this).I went to the doc today. Talked to her and told her I suspected something w/my thyroid (considering the sluggish weight loss), something to do w/my history of gestational diabetes OR bone spurs.She disagreed w/ALL of those suggestions, and instead said I had Plantar Fasciitis, and didn't test my blood sugar OR get blood work to test my thyroid...nor did she order an X-ray to rule out bone spurs.She merely gave me a prescription for Celebrex 100mg to be taken twice a day, which makes me nervous. I was on an anti-inflammatory before (Bextra) which was taken off the market due to deadly side effects! (I was on that drug for a year for early symptoms of Carpel Tunnel). And she also told me to roll tennis balls w/my foot in the arch and to do Achilles tendon stretches off a step or stool to help w/the tension. She also told me not to do ANY activities (such as working out) and that is just NOT an option for me. I have 4 dogs, they NEED a daily walk, and I NEED to lose weight before I get full blown diabetes. I cannot take any diet supplements till I wean my 8 month old after he's a year, so I feel trapped in pain. I am on absolutely NO pain medications. The doctor I saw today prescribed nothing even though I told her I was in tremendous pain. I feel like she totally blew me off. She DID give me a referral to a podiatrist off base (we are military), but I cannot call them till the AM and I just don\u2019t feel like what she diagnosed is the full story here.I don\u2019t like quick fix doctors. Which is how I feel she treated my case. I was in and out. Here\u2019s some pills...see ya later. No tests no detailed history (she didn\u2019t want to hear it). I really want a professional\u2019s opinion about my case. I 'd like to know what questions to ask the specialist I will be seeing (hopefully next week) and what tests or procedures I should demand to have done to get a real good idea of what can be done to help me.",
