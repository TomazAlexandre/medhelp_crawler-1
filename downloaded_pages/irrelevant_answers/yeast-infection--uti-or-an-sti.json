    "question": "A while back I stupidly met up with an escort.\u00a0\u00a0There was unprotected oral, and protected sex.\u00a0\u00a0I regret it, but it happened...I'm married.\u00a0\u00a0My wife is pregnant.Since then I've had no symptoms whatsoever.\u00a0\u00a0My anxiety, though is through the roof.Roughly 6-7 days after that encouter, my wife and I have unprotected sex.\u00a0\u00a0[The first time in months]\u00a0\u00a0At the time I did notice slight white substance from her on me, but didn't think anything of it.The following week she develops itchiness inside her vagina... and also has to frequently urinate.\u00a0\u00a0She starts taking internal cream [monistat] for a yeast infection and is then given antibiotics for a UTI.The UTI seems to have gone away, but the itch persists.She is pregnant and the earlier white substance i saw on myself does indicate ongoing yeast infection... but I don't know.\u00a0\u00a0I'm dying with anxiety over it.She is going in again for a full screening... but in the meantime.. given my previous exposure and the timeline... What is the likelihood I may have given her an STI [and myself without knowing it?].I deeply regret my actions.\u00a0\u00a0Not looking for judgement as I try to work on our own issues.\u00a0\u00a0Just want to make sure she, and the baby, is safe.",
