            "answer": "There are several reasons for swollen feet - they include heart conditions (cardiomyopathy), any type of renal dysfunction, or liver dysfunction.\u00a0\u00a0To work this up, I would suggest liver function tests and albumin (a type of protein) level, an echocardiogram, and kindey function tests (a creatinine level).If every test is negative, you may just want to treat the symptoms with a water pill as some people are just more prone to retain water.Regarding the night sweats - again, there are a myriad of causes.\u00a0\u00a0From your question, you are negative for TB.\u00a0\u00a0I would go through any medication that can be causing this, as well as test your thyroid as well as an HIV test.\u00a0\u00a0There are a variety of cancers (i.e. lymphomas) that can cause night sweats.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to discuss with your personal physician a chest and abdomen CT scan which is a reasonable first step to evaluate for this.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Thanks,Kevin, M.D.",

I urinate frequently.I don't have these symptoms during the day...although I do have dry mouth (so I drink a lot of water hence the nightly bathroom visits).In the last 2 days I've noticed that my feet feel slightly swollen (hard to put on some shoes) and the bottoms of my feet feel a little tingly.I'm a social worker and am on feet during the day...however...I have always done this and these reactions are dramatic and new.I've checked with my family doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have T.B. and my blood tests are fine.\u00a0\u00a0She asked about menopause...my periods are reqular...I don't have mood swings or any hot flashes during the day (it's only my feet that get hot).My doctor seems a little lost around this.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestion for her to persue.\u00a0\u00a0I've looked at this website and MS pops up for feet problems...is this a possibility...I can't imagine Diabetes..I'm fit and eat well.Thank you for taking the time to respond to my request...I'm concerned.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again.\u00a0\u00a0Natalie",
