            "answer": "I am sure you and your daughter's daughters have been working hard for months to try and figure out what's going on. They've probably considered this long since, but since you mentioned both stomach pain and neurological problems, I wondered if she had been tested for celiac disease, which I believe is more common in people with diabetes than in the general population. Information on celiac disease is available at the web site of the Celiac Disease Foundation at www.celiac.org. Another possibility might be inflammatory bowel disease.Good luck. I hope you find an answer soon.",

            "answer": "I agree with LRS that your daughter should be seen by an endocrinologist, for there are several other problems that seem to frequently happen to diabetics, including celiac disease, which was suggested earlier as a possibility. Do have her tested for this. The stomach pain could also be due to nerve damage in her stomach, called gastroparesis, which can be a complication of prolonged high glucose readings.If nerve damage is happening at her young age (I am bringing this up because of the swelling and the foot pain, which could be due to small blood vessel damage leading to nerve damage, all caused by high glucose levels), the most important issue to deal with is not really the pain, but the CAUSE, meaning the high glucose readings. Treating the symptoms without normalizing the glucose levels is futile. There are many types of insulin available today and there are pumps which can deliver insulin continually. There are also medications available to help treat insulin-resistance if your daughter truly is taking larger-than-normal doses of insulin with little effect. I would insist on her behalf that she see a pediatric endocrinologist and that treatments be explored to stabilize the blood sugar levels to protect her from further damage.That should happen first and foremost. Then you can work on treating the symptoms of pain and swelling of extremities. Although the pain may seem the more pressing issue, the root cause must be addressed to protect her from severe damage. As one who answers the e-mail requests that come in for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's Online Diabetes Support Team, I can assure you that youth is not necessarily protection from nerve damage and kidney damage and worse. Since she is showing symptoms that could be the beginnings of these things, the best thing that can be done is to bring those glucose levels to normal to protect her and to allow her body to regenerate as much as is possible if some damage is starting to happen. This must be done quickly to protect her, for some studies seem to indicate that nerves can regenerate if damage is caught very early. Some of our own volunteers attest to the fact that lowering glucose levels helps ease the discomfort caused by nerves that are being damaged.And, lastly, if nerve damage is NOT the cause of her problems, then WONDERFUL!! Good glucose control will protect her and will only improve her overall health and circulatory health, so I still stand by my urging you to insist on getting those glucose numbers under control before working on the pain issues. This is possible nowadays with all the different varieties of insulin therapy that are now available. One is probably right for your daughter.",

I was diagnosed at 11 with that.\u00a0\u00a0High blood sugar cause alot of complications.\u00a0\u00a0As for the stomach pains, it could be, possibly, gastroparesis...which is nerve damage of the stomach. I also have this, and it's the hardest of the complications. I would definetly take your daughter to an endo. if she has not seen one.\u00a0\u00a0My blood sugars where always running high levels until they came out with Lantus...I call it the miricle insulin. Im also on Humalog,which I find works quicker than R or novolog, maybe see if the doctor thinks that humalog might work better for her too....it worked wonders for me along with the lantus when they changed me over 2 years ago---Ill never go back-----Hope this helps and I hope things get better. I've been where you are myself...keep hope and faith",
