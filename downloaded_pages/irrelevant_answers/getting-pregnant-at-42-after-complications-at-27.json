            "answer": "Congrats on your pregnancy!\u00a0\u00a0I am also 42 and have an almost 2 year old and trying to conceive again.\u00a0\u00a0So welcome to the over 40 club!!If you developed gestational diabetes the first time around, then your risk is higher then average to develop it a second time. Also, we moms of \"advanced maternal age\" have an increased risk.\u00a0\u00a0It's easily managed though, and of course they will test for it.The same is true of preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0Pregnant women over 40 and under 20 are at higher risk, and you are considered higher risk if you had it in a previous pregnancy.Honestly, I wouldn't worry to much.\u00a0\u00a0One of the great things about having babies older is we get all sorts of extra tests made available to us.\u00a0\u00a0I say that is great because it means everything is caught and dealt with before it becomes a big problem.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure your OB is aware of your history.\u00a0\u00a0Take good care of yourself, take your prenatals and try to just enjoy.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like your in a wonderful situation to bring a new baby into.\u00a0\u00a0Congrats again, and please keep us posted.",
