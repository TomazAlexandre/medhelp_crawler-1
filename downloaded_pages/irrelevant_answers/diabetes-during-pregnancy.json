            "answer": "Gestational diabetes *****, but it's temporary I'm pretty sure. Avoid sugarry foods/ drinks and eat healthy meals. If you have a snack, have something low in carbohydrates and sugar...so like veggies. If you don't follow your diet, your baby will become quite large. Then giving birth will be more difficult. Don't panic, gestational diabetes is pretty common. Talk to your doctor or nutritionist and have them help you set up a healthy diet. Good luck, hon. I would suggest googling gestational diabetes, too, and see if you can learn something about how to handle it, just don't freak yourself out. The internet is full of people saying scary stuff.",
