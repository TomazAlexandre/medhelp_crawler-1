            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.Usually cause of RLS is unknown but few medications including lithium, antidepressants and beta-blockers can trigger the symptoms. However, it is essential that you consult your treating doctor before decreasing or stopping the recommended dose. Other reasons of RLS could be rheumatoid arthritis, kidney failure, diabetes or any underlying heart disorder. The leg pain of RLS typically eases with movement of the legs and becomes more evident at rest. Therefore, medicine dosage is usually prescribed before going to bed. Though there is no permanent cure of RLS, it is advisable that you take regular & sound sleep to get relief from your symptoms. Supplements of iron/vitamin deficiency certainly help in elderly patients with RLS to ease out symptoms. Other medications such as levodopa, bromocriptine, oxycodone may be tried to provide some relive in your symptoms. If your previous medicines are causing RLS, then they can be stopped or reducing the doses after consulting your treating doctor may help to control symptoms. Hope this information proves helpful to you. Take Care & Regards!!!",

            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Usually, it takes some time to resolve the symptoms completely after discontinuing medicines. Additionally, it will be essential that he consults his treating neurologist to evaluate the possibilities of pinched nerve in the region that may be the cause of persistent burning sensations. Hope this helps.",
