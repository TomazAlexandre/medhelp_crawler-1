            "answer": "Ok. This won't help but I had all the symptoms of adrenal insufficiency such as\u00a0\u00a0urinating 50+ times a day and constipation for months at a time BEFORE I was pregnant. This went on for years. I was known as the girl that was always running to the bathroom even 10 minutes after I just went. I think it was from the stress of undiagnosed, untreated Graves Disease. Of course, it continued during my pregnancy which is normal. But then, it all went away after I gave birth. Isn't that strange? I was tested for diabetes and UTI to see why I had to pee so much and was taking lots of prune juice, milk, laxatives to relieve my extreme constipation but something about being pregnant fixed it. Or maybe I was taking antithyroid med. No doctor for years at the time could tell me why I had to pee so much. One doc even suggested it was genetic.",

            "answer": "I am in the process of reading a book, \"Adrenal Fatigue: The 21st-Century Stress Syndrome\" by Wilson and Wright. It is readable and explains what adrenal fatigue is, why most of the tests don't detect it, and steps you can take to help heal the adrenals, such as proper diet, rest, and supplements. Simple things like taking some Vitamin C early afternoon to combat the 3-5 pm slump. What foods (caffeine, soda, chocolate) stress your adrenals and what foods give them a rest and/or support them. I'm only in the middle of the book, but so far it really makes sense and puts the control in your hands. If money is an issue, you may find it at the library.Good luck!",
