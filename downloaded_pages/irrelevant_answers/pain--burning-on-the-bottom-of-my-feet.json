    "question": "hello I have previously posted this question under a different Category, but I still need advise.I have pain in a burning sensation on the bottom of my feet. This occurs every day 24 hours a day some days are worse than other day but for the most part it is always there. My feet feel like they're literally sitting on the coals of fire. I have seen my doctor it has nothing to do with my diabetes as it is well control and they are no other health issues this is just started within the last six to eight months. I have recently started taking neurontin. I began last Tuesday at 300 milligrams once a day I'm currently taking, 600 milligrams twice a day that was increased after 5 days today which is a full eight days I have an increase again now taking 900 milligram a day. My question is has anyone else experienced the pain and burning in their feet and if cell what did you do and if you took neurontin how long before you began to feel better and what was the dose. thank you for any and all advice.Christina",
