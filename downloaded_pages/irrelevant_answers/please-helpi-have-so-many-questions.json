            "answer": "As for her weight I am sure she would lose a lot during treatment. No she will not feel better right away.She will feel horrible because that is how the meds you have to take make you feel. She will possibly be nauseous, fatigued, depressed. On the up side, by losing weight, she may eliminate the borderline diabetic aspect and her cholesterol will probably decrease.Good luck and God bless.",
