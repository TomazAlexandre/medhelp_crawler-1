    "question": "I've been on levlen ed for about 2months and my boyfriend and I have had sex most days besides when i get my period. But we haven't been using condoms because we were relying on the pill. Last week i started taking penicillian (sorry if i spelt it wrong) and we have ha unprotected sex at least 4-5 times and each time he ha ejaculated. And my doctor never told me about penicillian effecting the pill. And only last night i started vomiting pretty badly. Im scared to tell my mum. My boyfriend also thinks i may be pregnant. What's the chance of being pregnant? And I also have juvenile diabetes. What could that effect? Im scared.",
