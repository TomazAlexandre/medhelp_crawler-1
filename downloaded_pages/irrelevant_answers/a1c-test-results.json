            "answer": "Your HbA1c results of 6.2% is just over the high water mark, that is, if the testing was performed correctly and the lab did their job correctly. You can obtain a home test kit to verify. Here are a bunch I found http://tinyurl.com/3vhd22",

            "answer": "Thanks so much. I am almost thinking the results may have been something I ate the day before the test if that is possible. I had a large bottle of Diet Coke and a PIZZA !!\u00a0\u00a0Then later that night I had two big bowls of popcorn (micro ) and a slice of ham.Just before the test\u00a0\u00a0had a vitamin pill aspirin and an Aleve for my back.This is all quite new to me as I have had no experience at all with people who have had diabetes.I do appreciate your advice and would like to check out one of those home testing kits but I am thinking a second opinion from another source may be well in order first.What do you think ? I would value knwing your opinion.Thanks again RichieC",

            "answer": "I understand your concern and questioning because this all new to you. OK, let me try to define the glucose tests for you. First you MUST inform the doctor's office of any medication you're taking even OTC (over the counter). Aspirin is a blood thinner and can alter your lab results.\u00a0\u00a0Some labs need to adjust the test some do not. Its still good practice to inform your doctor of EVERY medication you're taking, including Aleve. This way the lab knows ahead of time if they need to make proper adjustments.You must not consuming any food or \"colored\" liquids for at least 8-10 hours prior to taking a fasting glucose test. Some doctor's prefer 10-12 hours. Clarify the fasting\u00a0\u00a0time amount required by the attending doctor. Do not assume anything. The test will only measure the amount of glucose in your blood at the time of the test. What it does is give an indication to whether you are pre-diabetic or diabetic. If you're determined to be borderline diabetic most doctors then order an HgbA1c (A1c) hemoglobin test.The A1c, on the other hand, doesn't care what you consumed the day before, the night before or the week before the test. It measures your glucose over the past three months then gives an average. This helps the doctor determine how your body adjusts to producing insulin as needed. For an explanation of the test go herehttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003640.htmEvery lab may have different readings for \"normal.\" Some may be below 5%, others 6%. On the national average its 6%. Get copies of your lab results (they're free for the asking) and see for yourself where you fall with your specific lab.As far as a second opinion, it doesn't hurt as long as the lab is different than one you just used. Call your doctor's office and ask what lab they use and then call the new doctor's office and ask what lab they intend to use. Having two results from the same lab doesn't make sense for you're not really getting two opinions, per say.A good source of information on Diabetes - Type I & II, Diabetes prevention, and nutrition is the ADA web site. http://www.diabetes.org/home.jspGood luck and good health.",

            "answer": "My A1C readings had always been in the 6 range until this past March.\u00a0\u00a0I suppose I lost my mind one day & ate Girl Scout Cookies (a weakness) and then Chinese Food for dinner.\u00a0\u00a0Had to go to emergency (meter level simply said \"HI\") where I received 2 insulin shots.\u00a0\u00a0In any case, I had always thought that any reading in the 6 range was a good one.\u00a0\u00a0After my stupid episode my level went up to 10.6 and I am working to bring it down.\u00a0\u00a0Take the other comments to heart, but it is my belief that anything in the 6 range is good.\u00a0\u00a0Definetely check with your physician on this or perhaps a Diabetic nurse.Anita",

            "answer": "Well in answer to some of your remarks I am pre diabetic I guess at this point . I also take aleve and an aspirin every morning. Aspirin is on the adice of the VA nothing at all to do with being a diabetice. They just told me it is a good thing to do. ALEVE I take daily for early morning back pain sometimes I even been taking two and that has been going on for months now. How can this effect my results ?I usually eat a low carb diet for the most part and I was doing some jucing as well for quite a while. The dietician thinks that may have actually added to the problem and with all this business about aspirin and aleve maybe that made things even worse yet ?No history of diabetics in my immediate family at all. I always had good to great check ups and all I was ever told is I could use to lose a few pounds and to stop smoking.I realy do appreciate all your comments and welcome any more you may have.Seems to be a GREAT bunch of people here as well.Again ALL\u00a0\u00a0thanksRichieC",

            "answer": "I have read that Aleve can cause damage to to liver.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know the risk percentages or what level of damage is likely,\u00a0\u00a0I would point out that as I understand it the liver liver stores glycogen when you eat.\u00a0\u00a0At night (during the fasting period) the liver converts this glycogen to glucose in order to maintain energy (sugar) levels for your resting but still functioning organs and tissue.\u00a0\u00a0The liver also helps in the regulation of cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0That said, we must all make decisions based on our particulars.\u00a0\u00a0You want less pain.\u00a0\u00a0I want lower cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0As my doctor said.. Choose the lessor of 2 evils.\u00a0\u00a0Uncontrolled diabetes can result in kidney failure and blindness, Both of which would severely impact my quality of life.I was admitted to the hospital on May18 with a blood sugar level of over 500.\u00a0\u00a0On June 4 rd my A1C test results came back at 12.1.\u00a0\u00a0I immediately took action to maintain healty blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0On Aug\u00a0\u00a06 (63 days later) my A1C tested at 5.9. I have also lost 25 pounds since my release from the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0Maintaining proper carb input levels (I believe) is the cause of the\u00a0\u00a0 weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck.Gary",

    "question": "Good Morning,I have always had good check ups. During my last check up where blood was taken at a local VA outpatient clinic I was told the very next day that I could be pre diabetic. Hit me like a ton of bricks because I do watch what I eat , have plenty of whole wheat oatmeal , try to stay low carg etc etc.They told me to fast after midnight and all I had before that was some popcorn as a sanck and abit earlier a slice of ham. During the day before the test I remember drinking a lot of Diet Coke which I usually do not have and when I do it is caffeine free.Just thought I would mention that.They called the next day to tell me that everything was great fine except they did not like my hemoglobin readings which where 6.2. As they have made errors on tests with me in the past I thought I may ask you what you think of this reading. Now they are scheduling an appointment for me with a counselor / nutritionist but that was my decision when they ask me if I would like that.Please let me know what you think about this reading. Does what you ate the day before have an effect on reading ? Is there a margin of error as well with such test ?\u00a0\u00a0Do you think I should request another test ?Truthfully I am a bit nervous and worried now > No one in my immediate family to my knowledge has ever had diabetes.Thank you so muchRichieC",
