    "question": "I have neuropathy in both of my feet they are always burning.\u00a0\u00a0Neuro and I are trying to figure out why I have neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0MS and most everything else has been ruled out.\u00a0\u00a0Was wondering how different my monitor numbers would be to the lab numbers.\u00a0\u00a0(i.e. I do have a BS monitor because I had Gestational and I also had Insulin Resistance a few years ago).\u00a0\u00a0Are they drastically different usually?\u00a0\u00a0I have been fine for a few years now, but recently started taking Neurotonin and have noticed my numbers are higher (170-199 range) 1-2 hours after I eat, but do always come back down to normal, so that's a good sign.I thought it would be neat to see what my BS's were on my monitor at the same intervals they took blood from my arm.\u00a0\u00a0Based on my results and the normal values for this test, I'll probably get a call saying I don't have diabetes, which is great news.....but on the other hand leaves a question to why I have neuropathy in my feet.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I will post when I hear my actual test results, but these are the ones I got on my monitor.75 mg glucose given.Fasting - 112 (it was 132 when I got up - then 112 by the time I got to the hospital).1/2 hr reading was 2501 hr reading was 2021.5 hrs. was 1332 hrs. was 87I don' t know unless there are some other guidelines out there, I probably don't have diabetes, which I would be SO RELIEVED if I didn't.\u00a0\u00a0If that's the case, I will just take my neurotonin for my foot neuropathy and be done with it.\u00a0\u00a0Never find that cause, what's the point.\u00a0\u00a0I think it's helping my burning feet now, so that's a huge relief.\u00a0\u00a0But there's that \"burning\" question in the back of my mind - why on earth did I get neuropathy to begin with?I'll post when I get ACTUAL results",
