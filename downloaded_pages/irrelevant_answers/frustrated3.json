            "answer": "You have been on meds - the meds *should* reduce the size of the lesion that is producing the prolactin.Now, it can be so tiny that it falls between the slices - after all MRIs are done in 3mm slices and pit tumors can be smaller than that. I had my prolactinoma hide for 12 years and not show up until a dynamic one finally sussed it out. I had symptoms - and had a Cushing's tumor too...Thyroid issues can also cause lactation. High prolactin can be caused by some meds but we know that is not your case....I understand the strike but hope you can hang in there.",

    "question": "So, I got the MRI report today which says:\"Overall ventricular size is normal.\u00a0\u00a0The cerebellar tonslls are normal in postition.\u00a0\u00a0There are no areas of brain parenchyma signal abnormality, restricted diffusion or abnormal enhancement.\u00a0\u00a0IN particular, the pituitary gland is normal in size, shape and enhancement pattern.\u00a0\u00a0The pituitary stalk is midline in postion.\u00a0\u00a0The major intracranial flow voids are grossly normal.\u00a0\u00a0Impression:\u00a0\u00a0Normal MRI of the brain without and wite gadolinium with attention to the pituitary gland.\u00a0\u00a0Preformed with GE 3 Tesla Twin Speed Dual Gradient with Excite Technology high definition.\"I am frustrated because my MRI last August done with a 1.5 machine showed enlarged prominant pituitary with no mass seen but couldn't be ruled out by imaging, repeat suggested.\u00a0\u00a0 My prolactin has been suppressed with Cabergoline since August, with a 6 week break off of it in the Spring and retesting at that time showed a significant increase in levels again.\u00a0\u00a0At this point I feel like I am going to go on strike...My plan... go off Cabergoline indefinately until they pin point the cause of high prolactin and lactation.\u00a0\u00a0I am sick of treating symptoms verses disease/disorder.\u00a0\u00a0I will continue to work at controlling my Hashimotos and Diabetes and continue testing for Cushings.Attached is an image of someone elses MRI and mine, for comparison.",
