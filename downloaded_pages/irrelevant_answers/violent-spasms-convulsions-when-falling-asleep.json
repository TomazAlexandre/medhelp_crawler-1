            "answer": "Hello,Are you taking any medicines for UTI and prostatitis? Some medicines like ofloxacin, levofloxacin etc may cause convulsions during sleep.Otherwise it seems to be a case of restless leg syndrome. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a disorder of the part of the nervous system that affects movements of the legs. Because it usually interferes with sleep, it also is considered a sleep disorder.People with RLS have strange sensations in their legs (and sometimes arms) and an irresistible urge to move their legs to relieve the sensations.Sometimes restless leg syndrome can be caused by diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, Cigarette smoking, magnesium or Vit B12 deficiency.Get your bld tests for any kind of anemia done.Also get yourself evaluated for diabetes by blood sugar levels. Polysomnography (sleep testing) may be necessary to diagnose the sleep disturbances and determine if you have periodic limb movements. Sometimes Needle electromyography and nerve conduction studies may be done for signs of neuropathy.First of all try lifestyle modification. Avoid or limit alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine for several hours before bedtime. Avoid eating a heavy meal close to bedtime and exercise regularly. Try not to use bedtime as worry time.Daily drug treatment is recommended only for people who have restless legs syndrome (RLS) symptoms at least three nights a week.So get yourself evaluated.If the symptoms do not improve after lifestyle modification, then pls consult a sleep specialist.Regards and take care.",

            "answer": "Hi,No wasn;t on meds when it started.The chills and fever from the Prostatis UTI have gone, so has the jerking.Magnesium was the first thing I thought of but supplements didn't help, I supplement occasionally with a multi B vitamin and that hasn't helped either.Diabetes did spring to mind the first time it happened on the train due (periphery (either circulation or neuropathy), eye and urinary tract involvement and pain behind the knees). I''d also just drunk a litre bottle of LucozadeThanks",

    "question": "I'm getting really worried by the increase in severity of the seizures I've been having. They happen only when I am going to sleep, whether laying flat on my side or snoozing. It's more than hypnic jerks.First occurance was a couple of weeks ago when I fell asleep on the train. It felt like going down in a big dipper then up again. I had some twitching and crawling sensations around my calves and feet after.Last night though it has been it's most severe, The centre point at the back of my head gets hot in the evening. I could feel swirling from my spine over my back, then a short dizzy spell then I started shaking my legs were lifting me off the bed. I convulsed for a few seconds.It usually happens a couple of times as I am falling asleep the initial one is the most powerful subsequent time it is less severe and I just go to sleep.I currently have a UTI or Prostatis.Any ideas what this could be or what Doctor to visit next?",
