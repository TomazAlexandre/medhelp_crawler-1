    "question": "I have had type 1 diabetes for 38 years (I'm 48) with only eye complications (cataracts and minimal hemorrhaging - sight is 20/20 corrected).\u00a0\u00a0However, over the past year, I've had pain / stiffness in my left shoulder, wrist, elbow, hip, knee, and ankle..and it's getting worse, impacting everything I do. The pain worsens only AFTER I've done a simple activity including walking down the hall, typing on the computer, or lying flat. I've seen a rheumatologist who has told me I have limited joint mobility (but I can put my fingers and palms together nicely which does not fit the criteria for LJM), and an orthopedic specialist who told me I have \"arthrofibrosis\" and that I shouldn't do anything that makes it more painful as that will worsen the fibrosis. All joint x-rays show no arthritis and all labs are completely normal (my HgbA1c is 6.8). My endocrinologist will not let me take an NSAID or coxib as he fears renal failure with use of these medications.I cannot find anything dealing with arthrofibrosis and long-term diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Can someone help me find more information on what's going on and what I may be able to do to help myself?\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.",
