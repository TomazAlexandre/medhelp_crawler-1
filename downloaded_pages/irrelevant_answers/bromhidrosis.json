Unhealthy personal hygiene, fungal infections, over weight, eating spicy foods and Diabetes are found to be responsible in most cases. The underlying cause needs to be identified first. Remove your underarm hair. Keep the area dry by using a talcum powder. Have a healthy and nutritious diet and maintain good personal hygiene. Add few drops of savlon to the water you use for bathing. Use an antiperspirant deodorant. Wash your clothes in warm water. For smelling in the vagina, you might be having a fungal infection and need to take antifungal treatment.
