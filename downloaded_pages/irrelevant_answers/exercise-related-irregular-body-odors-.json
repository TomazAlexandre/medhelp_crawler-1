            "answer": "This may be ketosis or in your case post exercise ketosis. You smell like acetone in a ketosis state . This is as close as i can find to nail polish; acetone is an ingredient in nail polish remover.The reason for ketosis is due to not enough glucose and so the body has to break down stored fat and convert it into energy instead. Metabolizing fat raises blood ketone levels therefore leading to ketosis. Ketosis can occur with type 1 diabetes, alcoholism, starvation, and with a low carbohydrate, high fat/protein diet.",

            "answer": "Thanks, Red Star. I think you're right. My research has led me to the same conclusion. However, I've done the ketone urine test strips and I come up completely negative. I've also had negative results in my blood work for ketones. I think my hypothyroidism is making my body do weird things. Thanks again.",

    "question": "I noticed that after I exercise, whether light or heavy, I develop a very strong, putrid body odor that has an earthy-musty smell or sometimes a \"nail polish\" smell. It is not the smell of regular BO. The smell usually occurs several hours later or the following day. And it usually lasts from 20 minutes to several hours. Yes, I shower, have good hygiene, don't seat excessively, and don't have anything in my nose! Symptoms also include being excessively hungry and thirsty. Tests for diabetes and liver disease have come up negative. These symptoms have been going on for approximately 8 months. I usually work out 5-6 days a week. When I stop working out for a day or two, the odors disappear.\u00a0\u00a0But they re-occur when I exercise, even light exercise.\u00a0\u00a0I've been recently diagnosed with Hypothyroidism. Any ideas as to what I may be experiencing? I am scheduled for an MRI. Bottom line: there is a direct correlation between me working out and these odd body odors.",
