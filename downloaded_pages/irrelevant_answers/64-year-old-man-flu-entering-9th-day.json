    "question": "My husband came down with flu (along with our children) 8 days ago (started with headache, sore throat, fever, shivers, aches and pains, after 3 days had severe diarrhea and vomiting and that went on for 2 days and then he just had this general unwell feeling. I didn't come down with the flu simply because I had the flu jab. We are just entering day 9. My husband as I say has a feeling of being generally unwell, but cannot say he has flu still. I know fatigue afterwards is normal, but in addition to fatigue he has lost his appetite, he has lost an awful lot of weight about a 1 stone (14lb) in the last 8 days. He also has a pain in his back (which he has had a long time but is now more severe, I notice this as he is struggling to walk) it is either side below the kidneys he also has a chesty cough. He just doesn't feel well, and I am having trouble convincing him to see a GP.He is 64, and has Diabetes, underactive thyroid, Bipolar and other various things that really haven't been attributed to anything.Any advice would be great. And I will in the mean time work on him re visiting a GP!",
