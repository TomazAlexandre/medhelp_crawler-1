            "answer": "Hi there!Laxity of muscles can be due to sudden discontinuation of physical exercises, though a few other possibilities such as myopathies, neoro-muscular issues, micronutrient deficiencies etc may need to be considered as well. Vertigo could be related to internal-ear or neurological issues. Premature ejaculation can develop in young adults due to a variety of causes; psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal/ endocrinal imbalance, low serotonin levels, autonomic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few.While a few of these could be due to abrupt discontinuation of exercises, it is unlikely to explain all your symptoms. I would suggest consulting a primary care physician for an evaluation and depending on the cause(s) diagnosed/ suspected, these can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this helps.Take care!",
