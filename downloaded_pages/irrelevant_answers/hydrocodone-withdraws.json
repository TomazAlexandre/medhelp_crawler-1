    "question": "I have been taking Norco for about 3 years, by RX from my Doctor, due to chronic pain in feet & hips. One of my teenage childs friend stole my pills, and I have 2 weeks before I go back to my Dr. Today is my first day with out. Is there any over the counter vitimains that can help with withdraws? I have been wanting to get off of these life controling pills for some time, but cold turkey wasn't what I had in mind. If anybody can help with suggestions to help with withdraws, I certainly would appreciate any help.Thanks, Tricia63",
