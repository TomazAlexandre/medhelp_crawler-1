This of course is not to be taken lightly because from what I am beggining to understand hep c can bring on diabetes and then diabetes can cause hep c treatment to be Ineffective.\u00a0\u00a0Of course you may not have diabetes yet and you can effect your blood sugar levels by what you eat. Yes\u00a0\u00a0soda and fruit juice don't help carb's,whcih turn into sugar, don't help either. So maybe you have a chance to control or turn it around with the right diet.",

Don't worry so much about \"organic\"\u00a0\u00a0You will find brands you know are fine, it's only a pain at first until you find things you enjoy. The bigget part of eating right is finding things you LIKE and look forward to that are good for you, otherwise you end up falling back on your \"old\" food items that are comfortable. I had a bit of a struggle with that part, but now I have a nice group of things I like. I notice now if something has salt added, it is far too salty for my taste now. Same with sugar. I dont normally tout any \"diet\" type plan, but the \"the best life\" approach that bob greene dreamt up is a good one. He's got a whole bunch of companies' products that have won his \"seal\" so that can make shopping easier too.He has great ideas for easy yet healthy eating. He also has a web site that is great and helps to make positive diet changes that really stick. you can find it at thebestlife.com. You really can turn it around and like timedog says, you have other influences right now that are also factors, it probably isn't ONLY diet but some of all the different issues, tx included.Good luck in your new employment!",

            "answer": "Was your test fasting or non fasting? I think you should get a fasting plasma glucose test if this was not a fasting one as 147 by many charts I have found is considered Diabetes, there is a chart poted below.Here is a burb from a Diabetes site:People develop diabetes because the pancreas does not make enough insulin or because the cells in the muscles, liver, and fat do not use insulin properly, or both. As a result, the amount of glucose in the blood increases while the cells are starved of energy. Over the years, high blood glucose, also called hyperglycemia, damages nerves and blood vessels, which can lead to complications such as heart disease and stroke, kidney disease, blindness, nerve problems, gum infections, and amputation.Types of DiabetesThe three main types of diabetes are type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.Type 1 diabetes, formerly called juvenile diabetes, is usually first diagnosed in children, teenagers, or young adults. In this form of diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas no longer make insulin because the body's immune system has attacked and destroyed them.Type 2 diabetes, formerly called adult-onset diabetes, is the most common form. People can develop it at any age, even during childhood. This form of diabetes usually begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which muscle, liver, and fat cells do not use insulin properly. At first, the pancreas keeps up with the added demand by producing more insulin. In time, however, it loses the ability to secrete enough insulin in response to meals.Gestational diabetes develops in some women during the late stages of pregnancy. Although this form of diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born, a woman who has had it is more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life. Gestational diabetes is caused by the hormones of pregnancy or by a shortage of insulin.Type 1 Diabetes and Type 2 DiabetesTo move away from basing the names of the two main types of diabetes on treatment or age at onset, an American Diabetes Association expert committee recommended in 1997 universal adoption of simplified terminology. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) agrees.Former Names Preferred NamesType Ijuvenile diabetesinsulin-dependent diabetes mellitusIDDM type 1 diabetesType IIadult-onset diabetesnoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitusNIDDM type 2 diabetes[Top]What is pre-diabetes?In pre-diabetes, blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be characterized as diabetes. However, many people with pre-diabetes develop type 2 diabetes within 10 years. Pre-diabetes also increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. With modest weight loss and moderate physical activity, people with pre-diabetes can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes.[Top]How are diabetes and pre-diabetes diagnosed?The following tests are used for diagnosis:A fasting plasma glucose test measures your blood glucose after you have gone at least 8 hours without eating. This test is used to detect diabetes or pre-diabetes.An oral glucose tolerance test measures your blood glucose after you have gone at least 8 hours without eating and 2 hours after you drink a glucose-containing beverage. This test can be used to diagnose diabetes or pre-diabetes.In a random plasma glucose test, your doctor checks your blood glucose without regard to when you ate your last meal. This test, along with an assessment of symptoms, is used to diagnose diabetes but not pre-diabetes.Positive test results should be confirmed by repeating the fasting plasma glucose test or the oral glucose tolerance test on a different day.Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) TestThe FPG is the preferred test for diagnosing diabetes due to convenience and is most reliable when done in the morning. Results and their meaning are shown in table 1. If your fasting glucose level is 100 to 125 mg/dL, you have a form of pre-diabetes called impaired fasting glucose (IFG), meaning that you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes but do not have it yet. A level of 126 mg/dL or above, confirmed by repeating the test on another day, means that you have diabetes.Table 1.

            "answer": "I know HCV/diabetes/tx all have a connection to your glucose and you are at higher risk for DIabete if you are HCV pos.and that's about it. Mine is a \"bit high\" my doctor said and mine was 107. I'd get the fasting one just to be sure. If you had eaten prior to your last test that can make a difference and what you ate can make a difference or at least that is what I was told. I wouldn't freak about it BUT I'd cut the sugars down, do you label read? If you do you know what I mean. If you don't, you will be shocked! I've seen juice with 30grams of sugar in ONE serving! So I say yes, the juice could influence things. Juices vary DRAMATICALLY with both sugar and salt content, no matter what \"low sugar\" or \"natural\" claim is on the front. I have gotten so I check everything. I know you can turn thi around of ot turns out elevated. You can get it back to normal very often with diet. I think it was smart to switch to lemon water, you can add a tad of juice for flavor, but most juice is BIG sugar if it is premade or concentrate. The bet way is juicing your own and adding no sugar, but that isn't practical for everyone. There are real whole fruit only juices but they are pricey.Let us know what you find out.",

            "answer": "I would like to clarify something. It was suggested that natural fruit juices with no added sugar are a better choice for glucose management. While there may be benefits to no-sugar added juice you should know that natural fruits do contain a lot of sugar and will significantly raise your glucose levels if portions are not controlled. For instance, when I get hypoglycemic (low blood sugar) a can of a soft drink will raise my glucose no faster or higher than will a 12 ounce glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. They both contain high and readily available carbohydrates and they both significantly impact glucose levels. Recently I saw an article which stated that high fructose has been shown to negatively impact the liver so for that reason fruit juice would be a better choice. But as far as glucose control is concerned, they are both about the same - in fact the juice may be higher than some soft drinks. One half glass of juice is the recommended portion for people with diabetes or who are pre-diabetic. I just wouldn't want you to believe that eating fresh or natural fruits or juices are without consequences in terms of glucose control. Obviously some fruits contain less carbs than others and you should acquaint yourself with the carbohydrate content of the fruits you like and adjust your portions accordingly. Mike",

If you have a glucometer check about 90 minutes after eating to give you a clearer picture of how food intake impacts your level. I see that your 147 was not a fasting glucose number. If it was within 2 to 3 hours of eating a decent portion of carbohydrates I wouldn't get too worked up about it. I'd just watch my diet, try to get some exercise and get checked periodically. On the other hand if it was a fasting glucose reading then that would be cause for concern.
