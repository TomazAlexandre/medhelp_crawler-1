            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Endocrine gland related conditions like hyperthyroidism, acromegaly and glucose control disorders (diabetes and hypoglycemia both) all result in increased sweating. All these have probably been investigated in your case. Pheochromocytoma, cancers, carcinoid syndromes, tuberculosis and other infections too can cause increased sweating. It can also be due to low blood pressure. Menopause can be another cause. Avoid too much of tea, coffee, smoking and spicy food as these can also cause hyperhidrosis. It can also be a part of anxiety-panic attack. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor regarding this.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am very hot inside and sweat very bad unless I am sitting under a 60 degree air conditioning vent.\u00a0\u00a0I've been to an Endocronologist, who after doing all the tests and they are normal levels, just does not have an answer for me as to why this is happening. It takes me an hour to dry enough after a shower to even start to think of putting clothes on.\u00a0\u00a0I can't get ready to go anywhere much less stay dry through my activity to not have to excuse myself to go dry off.\u00a0\u00a0Make-up is impossible.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have any kind of clue as what to do here?",
