    "question": "Hello,For the past few months I have been having some issues regarding my chin, under my tongue and even lips. Off and on throughout the day my chin will get a numbness sensation and will also be under my tongue and sometimes make my lips numb. My face will get flush and I become very hot. At times I thought that maybe I should eat something but this only seems to help the problem temporarily and then it comes back. Any suggestions? Also one of my eyelids is drooping, I am waiting for insurance to kick in. Any thoughts?",
