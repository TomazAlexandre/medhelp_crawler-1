            "answer": "Hi lola. I ve had a similar problem\u00a0\u00a0for a long time. It turned out to be a Vit B 12+6\u00a0\u00a0+folic acid deficiency. The biggest problem I had was my dr was only doing the basic blood work up and it was\u00a0\u00a0not showing up the real extent of the problem. I was receiving Vit B injections but was not getting any better until i saw a neurologist who did the full bloods .As a result of the deficiency I had developed sensory neuropathy. I am now being treated for the problem and started to feel better in a month. It takes time to correct this imbalence,I was told about 18mths before things are ok again. I hope this will be the case for you and not some thing more serious. Best of luck, Cath278.",

            "answer": "I am 41 I too have been suffering from numbness and tingling, to the point that it wakes me up almost every single night.I had , first one but ended up having 2 EMG/NCV one done on my hands and the other on my back(legs) they said I had bi-lateral carpal tunnel, and my back result showed polyneuropathy w/L-5 RADICULOPATHY. About a month later I asked my doctor to please run some blood work I just didn't feel right two days later the office called and said I need to come in right away. I have hypothroidism (?) They already did one CTS on my left ahnd and are operating on the right this friday, I see another Neurosurgeon for my nerve problem in my back at the end of the month. My point is this I've had this for a long time now and in the last two months all of sudden all these different tests are showing different problems, maybe its something different althogether who knows? But for years there was no proof and no one believed me. I have hypertension,chronic back pain, carpal tunnel, hypothyroidism, osteoarthritis,Neuropathy(poly), Raynauds(cold sensitivity)Make sure your educating yourself about any possible diagnosis your doctor may come at you with. Good LUCK",

Tingling in toes is a very common presenting feature of diabetic neuropathy.Other causes can be vitamin deficiencies like B12 deficiency and nerve compression. I would also suggest you to take B complex supplements and see if they help with your symptoms.Do keep us posted!",
