            "answer": "Did they definitely rule out Meneire's Disease?When was the last brain MRI that you had and did they do it with contrast?As far as MS, I have heard with diagnoses that it's not frequent that a person is exactly textbook in their symptoms.Regarding your need to urinate more often, are you also more thirsty?\u00a0\u00a0If so, with that and the weight gain, you might want to make sure you have not developed diabetes.Have you had your female hormones checked to see if they are in balance?\u00a0\u00a0Are you taking birth control pills or progesterone, which I beleive can have dizziness as a side effect?",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Well the commonest causes like postural hypotension, cervical spinal root compression and ear problems have been ruled out I think. Still see if a MRI of cervical spine was done.Other causes are anemia, claustrophobia, GERD, hypoglycemia or low sugar and some endocrine problems. Endocrine problems, such as an underactive thyroid (called hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (called hyperthyroidism), adrenal insufficiency (called Addison's disease), low blood sugar levels, and in some cases, diabetes, may lead to hypotension and hence lightheadedness and an off balance feeling.Since you have weight gain and more urination look into diabetes.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Hi all,Thank you so much for taking the time to respond - it is very much appreciated.I have been tested for Diabetes, Hypoglycemia and had my thyroid has been tested and it has all come back clear. They have also ruled out Meneire's disease. My last MRI on the brain was about 2 months ago and it came back clear. Reagrding the need to urinate more often - I am not always thirsty, I just seem to go more often during the day then I used to.I also just found out that one of my tests I did 2 months ago showed that I had significant nystagmus when positioned to the right (I think) so I have no idea what this means. The ENT Specialist told me at the time that all results came back clear, but when I went to my family Doctor 2 days ago she was just going through all my tests when she noticed that the results advised the presence of nystagmus. I think nystagmus it is a symptom of vertigo, but I still don't know what causes the vertigo. I have no idea why the ENT specialist said everything was clear when it wasn't so I am going to ring him tomorrow to find out. Not at all happy though, as this could be a clue as to what is wrong with me.As for MS, I am still keeping an eye on this one as I do have a few of the symptoms they list. Fingers crossed this will not be the case thoguh!I am quite concerned as the vertigo is getting worse and have even spent most of today in bed.One person I have't visited yet is an Optomologist, so I think they will be next on my list.Thanks to everyone who has responded and please feel free to keep sending replies as the more help the better! :)",

    "question": "Hello,I am a 29 year old female and have been suffering from vertigo or dizziness (not sure what the difference is) for the past 6 months. One day I was sitting at work, completely fine and the next day I woke up and the whole room was spinning. I went to the Doctor who said it was a virus and should clear up in a week or so. Well 6 months on and I still have it. At first it was just when I looked at a computer and so I had my eyes tested... all clear. I changed my computer settings, the fluro lights above my desk and the height of my computer but nothing made it better. On weekends the dizziness settled down a lot, but I would get a wave of dizziness every now and then when walking around.About a month after this I had a CT brain scan... all clear. This was then followed by a MRI of the brain, a visit to a Neurologist and an ENT specialist and a 3 hour hearing, balance and vision test. Results all came back clear. The ENT specilaist thought it might have been Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, but I was cleared for that.I have been to a Naturopath, remedial masseaus, Acupuncutrist and had blood tests done. Nothing has helped.I then went to a Muscular Skeletal Specilaist who was positive it was related to my neck, so performed a series of neck exercises and I had to do them in my spare time as well. 6 weeks on and still dizzy. I had a MRI of my cervical spine yesterday and the results came back clear.I am not sure if it is dizziness or vertigo. I don't feel like I am going to faint at all and have been getting a good night's sleep every night, so maybe this means it is vertigo.For the past 2 months the dizziness has been all day every day, sometimes even when I am lying still on my back. I have had my blood pressure taken and it is normal. The dizziness has taken over my life as I had to give up work and hence am now unemployed. I can still walk but after a little while it gets to me and I have to lie down for a little while afterwards. I am always fatigued, though I am not sure if this is a direct symptom of the illness I have, or from the constant dizziness. I sometimes get nauseaus from my head spinning, but I do not experience any headaches.In the last month I have noticed the need to urinate more often, but I have also put on weight due to me not being able to exercise, so once again I am not sure if this is from the weight gain or a direct cause from my illness.I have also noticed that it takes me longer to do maths and my spelling is not as good as it used to be. I asked the Neurologist about this but he seems to think this is just from the fact that people nowadays use calculators and spell check on their computers. My quick wit has also slowed down, but not sure if this is from the illness or because I have been off work for 4 months and my brain is no longer getting stimilated by working.I have no breathing difficulties and no allergies that I am aware of.I am trying to work out a pattern for my dizziness but as it is all the time now, I have been unable to pin point when it happens the most.Can anyone help me with this?? I am almost out of ideas and the Doctors don't have a clue what is wrong with me.A friend mentioned Multiple Scelrosis, but I looked up the symptoms to this and I have never lost vision in any of my eyes or experienced any tingling or numbness in my body, so am thinking this is not the cause.Computer work is very difficult as my eyes take that little bit longer to focus on the words, even though my general eyesight is perfect.Anyway, I am in desperate need of an answer and any replies to this would be greatly appreciated!Thanking you in advance,Sarah",
