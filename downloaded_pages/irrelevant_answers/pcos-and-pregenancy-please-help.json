            "answer": "a friend of mine, in her early 30s, had similar problems before. she was a typical PCOS patient with symptoms of being overweight and hairy. her family shared this illness history also. she probably had her periods twice a year. however, she did get pregnant with her husband after a few months attempt. she told me she found some hormone alternative cream (i cannot remember exact name) at a grocery store (Wildoats) and apply the cream on inner thighs, under armpits and around breasts. meanwhile, she followed her doctor and had sex twice a week. i'm actually not sure if that cream helped that much, but it worked. she got a girl. it's worthy mentioning that she had diabetes during pregnancy. she didn't gain a pound for the whole time she was pregnant, which might not be a good thing. i guess her story is encouraging. i recommend you talk to your doctors about alternative therapies. finally, don't forget that normal couples plan about 1 year to become pregnant on average. so don't be disappointed! good luck :-)!",
