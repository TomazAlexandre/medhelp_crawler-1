            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Seizures happen due to sudden, abnormal electrical activity in the brain. It may be due to a bleed, a tumor, a worm, a demyelination process, or without a cause. This may or may not be associated with convulsions.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Note there is a difference between the cause of a seizure and a trigger.\u00a0\u00a0Seizures can be caused by head injury (at any time in your life), diabetes side effects, a high fever as a child or a virus/bacterium like meningitis.Triggers are things like alcohol drinks, flashing lights (like driving a car through shade/shadow or watching window blinds flickering the light from a breeze, or for some people anything raising the adrenaline level.\u00a0\u00a0In women, PMS is usually a trigger.\u00a0\u00a0Keeping track of what you were doing or experiencing in the 24 hours before a seizure will bring out any patterns and help you limit the seizures by limiting the triggers.If you lose awareness and/or ability to function during a seizure, do not drive or work around machinery if at all possible.\u00a0\u00a0Get checked for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Get the seizures treated, they may get worse and/or more frequent if you continue to have them.\u00a0\u00a0There are lots of seizure medications out there now than there were 10 years ago, so see a neurologist who specializes in seizures and their treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Do not take your general practitioner's advice as the last word.",
