            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (lymphnode in area between collar bone and jaw) is worrisome. Especially the ones larger than 1cm in diameter should be investigated thoroughly for cancers and granulomatous diseases. The right supraclavicular area receives drainage from the organs in chest, whereas the left supraclavicular lymph nodes drain the abdomen. The supraclavicular lymph nodes also receive lymphatic drainage from the breasts. Hence the malignancies of these regions are possible. Tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, histoplasmosis, cat scratch disease and cryptococcosis are the other possibilities. I understand the anxiety and you have an early appointment with your doctor. The lymphnode can be unrelated, and you may just be feeling tired due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroids etc. However, everything needs to be checked by your doctor. Take care!",
