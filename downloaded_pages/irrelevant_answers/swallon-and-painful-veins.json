            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Either you have high blood pressure or you have an extensive peripheral vascular disease causing thrombosis or clots at various sites. This can be ruled out either by angiograms or by dopplar studies. Diabtees, high cholesterol, thyroid problems etc will also have to be ruled out as a cause of this disorder.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral to a cardiologist or a vacular specialist.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
