            "answer": "Saturday. He was fine all day.He did not die from pulmanary embolism. He had no jaundice. His heart was not being monitored by cardio machine.

    "question": "My father went in early on a Monday because he had eaten spicy food and it agrivated his gallstones. He went to a\u00a0\u00a0hospital and was there for four or five days until he had the stones removed and it was successful !He had coffee he told me and they were even letting him have chicken??? I spoke to him around 1 am and he was fine. He was waiting for the removal of the gallbladder on Monday...so we were just checking in with him on Saturday. He made many calls that day...all was well.\u00a0\u00a0At 11 pm they checked his blood pressure. At 1 am a new nurse on call came in to find my father unresponsive.The next day (I was there within 4 hours from across the country) we called the nurse on call and she said she had not seen anything like this happen on her watch. On the autopsy it said nothing.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone got any idea what might have happened? My father was 65. Any insight would be appreciated!",
