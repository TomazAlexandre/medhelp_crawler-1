            "answer": "I just had my 32 week appointment today and mine said I'll start coming weekly too. Other than some of my gestational diabetes coming back a little high but still passing and he said I measured big today but baby was probably stretched out, I've been pretty normal. I think it's just doctor preference. Or maybe he knows something he's not telling me. Idk",

            "answer": "I'm 31 weeks and have to go weekly now. My doctor is concerned because my baby is measuring sort of small (35th percentile) and because I have hypertension and I'm very swollen. I also have been having lots of Braxton Hicks contractions that I didn't even know I was having until he checked! He wants to monitor them and my baby's tolerance to them.",

            "answer": "If there's anything you should be concerned about your doc would defintiely tell you. I'm 30 weeks and start bi-weekly visits now. When i was prego woth my now 4 year old, i went straight from monthly visits to weekly visits. I also use the same doc now as i did with my first. I think the doc just goes off of measurements, weight gain, things like that. I wouldn't worry about it, worrying leads to stress and stressing is a no no",

    "question": "I will be 32 weeks tomorrow. My doctor's is now wanting to see me weekly. But my last doctor with my first pregnancy didn't start seeing me weekly until I was 36 weeks. My next appointment is Monday. Any possible reasons why or is it something every doc does differently?",
