    "question": "I have a two year old minature poodle which was quickly trained as a puppy to go outside to his kennel and relieve himself. Last month he has started urinating only just inside the house from his door to the kennel. He does this at night and not during the day. There are no changes at the house, other than it has been cold outside [for California]. It is not every night.",
