            "answer": "Many, many things can cause unexplained weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0This can include various causes of malabsorption, metabolic disorders, thyroid disorders, chronic infection or cancer.Without examining you, it would be impossible to say what could be causing the symptoms in your case.\u00a0\u00a0For a start, I would suggest a thyroid panel, blood count, metabolic panel, sedimentation rate, and liver panel.\u00a0\u00a0To evaluate for malabsorption, a panel for celiac disease as well as sending off the stool for fat malabsorption can be considered.Regarding the possibility of cancer, it is recommended that age-appropriate cancer screening is up to date.\u00a0\u00a0For your age, that would be pap smear, mammogram, and colon cancer screening (if there is a family history of colon cancer).Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Kevin, M.D.Medical Weblog:kevinmd_b",

            "answer": "Thank you for the comment.\u00a0\u00a0When I was seen by the doctor she took a urine sample and said there was no glucose in it, and I assume if my blood glucose had been high they would have called me by now, I would hope.\u00a0\u00a0There is diabetes in my family, but type 2, related to overweight.The fact that I can maintain weight if I eat like a horse is good, I think.\u00a0\u00a0I would think that if I were sick I'd eat alot and lose weight anyway or I wouldn't have an appetite.",

    "question": "About a year ago, I began increasing protein in my diet, but I did keep some carbs, and ate alot of fruits and vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0I weighed 130lb, appx, at that time.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, about six months later I realized I'd dropped 20 lb.\u00a0\u00a0I only stand five feet, so I was happy and didn't change anything, but noted a few months later, that I was down to 101, so I began eating lots of carbs, but now find I have a difficult time staying around 103.\u00a0\u00a0I have to eat alot everyday, and drink ensure to keep the weight on.\u00a0\u00a0Okay, for instance, in one day I'll eat salmon patties, 3 or 4 peanut butter sandwiches, spaghetti dinner, can of ensure, 2 or 3 bowls of cereal, and doing that, I CAN maintain weight, but if I drop down on what I eat, it comes right back off.My question is, have I altered my metabolism?\u00a0\u00a0Is that possible?\u00a0\u00a0I honestly don't feel sick, and my appetite is okay.\u00a0\u00a0I do get fatigued easily though and have to go to the bathroom 4 or 5 times at night, (urinate).\u00a0\u00a0Rarely do I have loose stools and I have no stomach pain or history of ulcers or anything like that.\u00a0\u00a0I'm on NO meds.\u00a0\u00a0I tend to think I'm not sick, but people keep worrying about me, and asking if I've seen a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I did, and she said she didn't think it was anyting to be concerned about, and drew some blood.\u00a0\u00a0That was last week and I haven't heard anything, so no news is good news.\u00a0\u00a0*S*I am, by the way, 44 years of age, and have always enjoyed good health.\u00a0\u00a0I'm just surprised by this because all my life I've tended to gain weight.\u00a0\u00a0This is a change for me.Thank you for your time.\u00a0\u00a0I'll appreciate any information you can give me regarding metabolism.Julie",
