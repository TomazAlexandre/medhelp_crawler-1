            "answer": "There is no evidence that your cholesterol med Simvastatin [Zocor] raises glucose levels nor does it cause diabetes. Your doctor is correct. Poor diet/nutrition is a major contributor to your high cholesterol, your rising glucose levels and will lead to full blown diabetes. Other contributing factors are being a \"bit overweight\" and lack of exercise.\"..could they point me to an authoritative source that I could direct him to?\"Point him to? Sorry, it is you that needs direction, not your doctor.Too many people rely solely on medication to make themselves normal when basic lifestyle changes are ignored. Let us not forget Type 2 diabetes is associated with being just a \"bit overweight\", high cholesterol, high blood pressure, lack of daily exercise, and above all poor food choices.Proper nutrition means to accentuate the positive when it comes to food. I dislike the word diet. \u201cDiet\u201d implies a rigorous, self-sacrificial discipline that\u2019s doomed to fail. Instead, focus on achieving food goals of what you should eat each day rather than what you shouldn\u2019t eat. When you consume more vegetables, healthy fats [such as olive oil and nuts], lean proteins, fruits combined with low carbohydrate, low calorie, low starchy foods, your hunger will be satisfied and you will naturally want to make better choices.These are the key items in lowering your glucose levels:1. Weight: Lose the excess poundage. A bit overweight says you're fat. Lose it.2. Exercise: 30 minutes a day. Go to the nearest mall b4 it opens. It's warm, dry and safe. You'll find others in the same boat as you walking their excess glucose and poundage off. And don't stroll lazily, walk at a moderate continuous pace.3. Nutrition/diet: Besides sugary foods and liquids simple carbohydrates are one of your worse enemies. The sugars in these foods are quickly absorbed into your blood stream. Avoid white foods; foods made with white flour such as white bread, white rice, crackers, potatoes, pasta.Other foods/drinks need care too. For example; milk has Tablespoons of sugar, fruit & fruit juices [fructose aka fruit sugar] also can cause blood sugar to rise [so serving sizes and moderation are important]. With fruit it\u2019s important to eat them with other foods to slow the absorption of fructose. I'm NOT saying that these foods aren't allowed. What I AM saying is that you need to use care and follow the guidelines for diabetics \u2013 avoid sugar, avoid bad carbs, avoid sugary liquids, eat proper foods.Ignore these lifestyle changes and you WILL become a diabetic. And keep in mind, there is no cure for diabetes so now is the time to turn your life around. Good luck.",

I look great too, and so far no D meds.\u00a0\u00a0My wife also jumped on the low carb bandwagon, and has lost 15 pounds, and looks fantastic. She's also a T2, and has been on Metformin for a couple of years.One thing we both found invaluable was testing our blood.\u00a0\u00a0For me, it turned into a competition against myself; always striving for a lower reading that the same period the day before.\u00a0\u00a0I've reduced testing to twice a day, as I've gotten the hang of what foods drive the BG's. high.\u00a0\u00a0I've kind of hit a weight loss plateau, leveling off around 189 pounds. I'm still dropping, but it's much slower now.Bottom line, toss anything \"white\"; rice, pasta, flour, potatoes, and of course sugar. I saw an 60 point drop in fasting BG within two days when combined with exercise.\u00a0\u00a0In the beginning, levels fluctuated wildly throughout the day, but have settled in the low 90's now.\u00a0\u00a0My physician was beside himself after expecting me to come back at the same levels.\u00a0\u00a0He went so far to warn me not to go obsess, but I do most things in life as all or nothing, and it's no different here.",

Then, the hunger pangs diminished, and no longer that viscious hunger that I was experiencing.\u00a0\u00a0After that, it was pretty smooth sailing.I found that if you choose this ultra low carb lifestyle, you have to stick with it.\u00a0\u00a0I look at it very simplistic.\u00a0\u00a0Bodies crave carbohydrates.\u00a0\u00a0It's what fuels the \"engine\".\u00a0\u00a0If it has to, it'll convert fat to sugar, but that's last ditch.\u00a0\u00a0When you stop refueling with carbs, the body complains, but eventually will switch over to metabolizing fat, and that leads to weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0BUT..!! you can't cheat!\u00a0\u00a0If you chow down on a pizza, rice, or birthday cake, the body goes \"HEY!!...CARBS!!\" and immediately drops the fat burning process, and scarfs up the carbohydrates using them for fuel and storing what it doesn't need back onto your belly, and all the other unpleasant areas you've been looking at in the mirror that were getting smaller.\u00a0\u00a0I see this process in my wife.\u00a0\u00a0She cheats.... not on me.... but with the food she consumes.\u00a0\u00a0She's constantly reversing the gains and sacrifices she's made by previously pushing away birthday cake, or the free Munchkins at work on Friday.\u00a0\u00a0WHen she finally got the hint and stuck to the plan.\u00a0\u00a0Weight loss, and lower BG's were much easier to acheive.So the key to my new dietary lifestyle is maintaining consistancy, always on track, never slipping for even a second.\u00a0\u00a0My wife complains that sometimes our food choices are at times boring.\u00a0\u00a0This in part is perhaps my fault, beacuse it doesn't take much in the way of food to make me happy.\u00a0\u00a0I eat two hard boiled eggs each and every day, and I could do it for the rest of my life.\u00a0\u00a0It's not because I like them, it's just sustenance.\u00a0\u00a0My wife on the other hand wants to be happy while she eats, and would much rather have waffles drenched in maple syrup.\u00a0\u00a0For me, it doesn't bother me to eat a piece of pepper jack cheese with five Wisconsin \"Turkey Bites\" for breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0Actually.... I kind of like it!Now that I'm T2, this is the way I have to live.\u00a0\u00a0Right or wrong, I blame myself for putting me where I'm currently at.\u00a0\u00a0I had 60 years of fun playing with excessive amounts of carbs, and now it's time to pay the piper.",

My mother whom I have cared for, for many years was overweight, had high blood pressure, high cholesterol, osteoarthritis etc, etc. is on all kinds of meds. Norvasc and Simvar in particular for some years. I have managed to reduce her weight through changes in diet mainly (she is hemiplegic, so can't exercise as others can). But because my husband is diabetic (resistant to change also), I have changed our family meals so they are lower in carbs and lower GI wherever I can. My mother still benefits from her meds and has lost weight. I haven't looked into any studies, but now you have brought this to my attention, I will. As said before, Good luck and may good health be with you. xxx",
