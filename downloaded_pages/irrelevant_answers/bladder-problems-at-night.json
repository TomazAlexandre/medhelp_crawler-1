            "answer": "Hi,You need to consult a physician and rule out some of the common causes of nocturia (night time urination). For e.g. Diabetes mellitus, a stone in the urinary tract, any enlargement of the prostate (which is less likely considering your young age).Also will suggest you to avoid drinking too many fluids around bedtime and particularly avoid drinking tea, coffee and beer around the bedtime.\u00a0\u00a0A simple and quite effective way of doing the same is to keep a diary of how much you drink, what you drink and how it affects your symptoms.I sincerely hope that helps. Please do keep me posted. Warm regards.",
