I have been mildly hypothyroid for many years, in retrospect.I felt better during my pregnancies and a friend told me that sometimes you can normalize during the pregnancy. I wasn't so sure, but I am more convinced now after reading your account and the input from chigirl29.I think I will ask my endo next visit.As chigirl29 has said, just make sure to keep tabs on your levels throughout the pregnancy and after.Congrats and good luck!",

    "question": "Hello Dr-Would appreciate your input ...Quick history:Was diagnosed as midly hypothyroid, TSH of 6.5, a few years ago and was put on 50 mcg of levoxyl. TSH was normal while on treatment.I recently became pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Was so naseous during early pregnancy that couldn't keep levoxyl down / in system.\u00a0\u00a0Stopped taking for a few weeks, and had TSH tested at 6 weeks pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0TSH was 1.6, so the doctor told me to not resume taking levoxyl.TSH has been tested every 6 weeks since then and has been within normal range - between 1.0 and 2.5, so have not resumed levoxyl.\u00a0\u00a0Last week, at 30 weeks, TSH had crept up to 2.85.I'm a bit nervous about not taking any levoxyl, but continue to test normal TSH.Is it possible that my body's thyroid function normalized during pregnancy, given that I was only midly hypothyroid to begin with?Would you recommend that I begin treatment again now that TSH is above 2.0?Should I be worried at all, or feel comforted by normal TSH tests?\u00a0\u00a0How \"fail-safe\" is the TSH test?Thank you so much for your help.",
