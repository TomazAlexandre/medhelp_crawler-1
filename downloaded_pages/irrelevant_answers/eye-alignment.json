            "answer": "Dr. Feldman,I have a couple of questions. On my visit to my optometrist he did a complete exam and when he did the air puff test he said presuure was a little high, 26 and 24. He referred me to an opthamologist. My opthamologist did a complete exam and said my visula fields were normal and optic nerve was normal and that I do not have glacoma.The Dr. did say I have ocular hypertension and recommended Xalaton drops nightly, as a prophalictic measure. I returned after a few weeks and my pressure\u00a0\u00a0dropped to 17 and 19 which the Dr. was happy with. Now I return every 4 months\u00a0\u00a0for now to follow up.I was quite worried, and my Dr. said he feels my vision will be fine with regular\u00a0\u00a0visits and the preventative meds.I am 61, can this ocular hypertension be treated successfully, I appreciate\u00a0\u00a0your time and response.\u00a0\u00a0Mario",

    "question": "I have one eye that looks may off to the left. This came on 9 years ago. I have been tested for whipples, MS, Diabetes, nieman pick type c, Raychers, Lyme's and Aids. The Doctors think I have Mitochondrial Diease but it was tested six times and all the test were inconclusive. Five years ago they adjusted the muscles to realign the eyes and this was good for a year and then they drifted apart again. The Doctors have no idea what it is. This causes problems with vision, balance and depth perception.",
