            "answer": "And I thought of that, I just feel bullied about it. I wish I knew what it was about pregnancy that other people think that it's up to them to decide how and when the woman actually goes into labor? I think it's a little sadistic to try to guilt the poor, laboring pregnant woman into an excrutiating labor and delivery when there's absolutely no need other than you just want your grandson here. Just a little frustrated! Not to mention that the induction itself would have been so much harder in him as well and could have led to a c-section...",

            "answer": "Don't let them ruin your decision, it's your baby and your labor experience not theirs, being induced mostly leads to a c section which is why I will not get induced, be happy, your baby will come when it's ready. Just ignore them.",

    "question": "So I was scheduled to be induced at 7AM this morning - showed up, about 7:30 my midwife came back, checked my cervix and informed me that my cervix had ripened since last week but still had no dilated, and then inserted Cervadil to see if I would progress and dilate throughout the day. The \"plug\" was in for 10 hours, and when may midwife came to check me many hours later, told me that after back laboring all day, that I had only dilated 1 cm & was 50% effaced. Now just a background I had not wanted to be induced, at all. The only reason that I agreed was because I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes - and after today after being on the monitor all day, my midwife had said that he was reacting beautifully and saw no reason that we couldn't go home and wait to see if I went into labor naturally. Though they were present in the room when my nurse and midwife explained that I was already laboring at a pain scale equivalent to being 6-7 cm dilated, and that breaking my water and starting me on pitocin would have tripled my back pain, my mother and MIL are both very angry with me and think that I'm just being a coward in not just getting it over with... my fiance and I are happy with our choice, he knew that I would've preferred going into labor naturally and that this was important to me, but I still feel bad and horrible because I have the two of them angry at me...",
