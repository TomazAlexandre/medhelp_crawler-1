            "answer": "Hi Pam,I am pretty confident that the answer to that is no.The bladder and bowel problems have to do with nerves not correctly firing to coordinate the muscles that are ultimately in control of emptying.\u00a0\u00a0Throw in the drugs we take and that contributes to the problem, too.A yeast infection has nothing to do with muscles and nerves.That said, you could have recurrent yeast infections because of the antibiotics were are often on to treat the UTI's.hope that makes sense,Lulu",

            "answer": "I agree with Lulu, if you are taking a lot of antibiotics, then that can cause lots of\u00a0\u00a0yeast infections. Diabetes can cause alot of yeast infections as well as pregnancy. When I was pregnant with my son I was a \"walking yeast infection\", lol I know that sounds funny but I had a yeast infection almost the entire time I was pregnant with him but I also had gestational diabetes which attributted to it.Hope you find and answer to what is causing yours.Good Luck,Paula",

Lulu, yes that does make sense.. and Paula, you just reminded me of my sister, LOL, she had that same problem, and she said she was a \"walking yeast infection\" when she was pregnant also! Very funny, even though it definately does not feel too good. I have tried the over the counter inserts, they would go away and them one week later, it was back again. I am def. getting annoyed!!I am at a loss as to why this is happening.. I honestly never had this happen for this long, on and off like this. It just doesn't make sense to me. I guess its time to call the doc........ again.........",

            "answer": "Hi Deb, Yes I have been tested for diabetes. I had to do the 6 hr. test because my endo made me eat a big bowl of ice cream with a ton of choc. and caramel and sugary toppings and then draw my blood two hrs later. My sugar went down to 60. He believed that was why I have been sooooo fatigued and have to take naps daily.My 6 hr. test proved otherwise. I am so glad it was normal.I still dont understand why my sugar dropped after all of that sugar, but thank God it was just that time.This is the first time in 2 years since my last yeast infection. I normally do not get these that often. For some reason, I cannot get rid of this one. It started at the end of July. I did the treatment and thought it was gone. In August, when it felt like it was starting again, I treated again. By Sept. it started up again, At this time, not only am i annoyed, but my hubby is too. LOL\u00a0\u00a0October..... here we go again.!! Now i say, come on are you kidding me.. That's why I thought, hey, could this be something else I should be looking into, or not.Thanks for your input. When i go to see my doc. about this, maybe she can fill me in as to why I can't get it to clear up.",
