            "answer": "Hello, i have type 1 diabetes and am bipolar which used to be called manic-depression. i have been taking medications for both and i am glad you are trying to handle a difficult time. But you have answered your own question in ways in that i highly recommend you see a psychiatrist as they are medical doctors with special training in medications for mood disorders. i know how you feel as i've been more than a handful for my wife to deal with at times. But i have worked with my psychiatrist to try different medications to get to some that work because when i go through a depressive episode the care for my diabetes falters. i have many complications because i've been diabetic over thirty years now and the best thing i can do is keep my sugars as close to normal as i can which i have expressed to my psychiatrist so we can work harder to get meds that work.Good luck and try to keep a good attitude. buddhabret",

            "answer": "Dear camronsdaddy,I am so sorry you are going through this. I am a volunteer and not a doctor so please understand that I am not qualified to give you medical advice. I can give you my own life experience dealing with type 1 diabetes regarding my son and autoimmune disorders that I also deal with myself.My son has had diabetes for 20 years and we do know that episodes of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia alone will cause mood swings. I do agree with buddhabret, that you probably need to speak to a psychiatrist and to your endo. I am coming at this from many different points and this is about some of your medications.First, the research that I have done on depression and not only type 1 diabetes, but any chronic illness is more normal than not. The studies are varied, but can be very telling.You said you have type 1 diabetes and two other autoimmune disease's. One is addison's, can you share the third? I would like to recommend a website that may help with your addison's and possible medications you are taking for it. It is www.niddk.nih.gov/health/endo/pubs/addison/addison.htm.I have rheumatoid arthritis myself and know that prednisone can cause mood swings, especially when I am trying to reduce the amount that I am taking.You also seem to be experiencing hypoglycemic unawareness and this diffently needs to be discussed with your endo. It may take a consultation with different doctors who specialize in both type one and addison's.Please let us know how you are doing and watch for other comments from others here in the forum.I wish you the very best,dm",

            "answer": "In addition to the wonderful information that you have already been given, let me add two things:1. Being either hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic over an extended length of time can affect seratonin levels, which affect your moods. The next time you have bloodwork done, you may want to have the seratonin levels checked to see if your levels are normal. This can be treated if the numbers are off.2. Many medications can have the side effect of making you more sensitive to insulin. Some also can have side effects of raising or lowering glucose levels without changing insulin sensitivity. All of these will have adverse affects in diabetics. Doing frequent glucose checks after starting any new medication is necessary in order to be able to note any changes in glucose or sensitivity to insulin. If you notice changes from your \"normal\", then it may be smart to talk wtih the prescribing doctor to see if other medications can be used without the adverse side effects. ALL of your physicians should be aware of ALL of your medications, for the combinations can have all sorts of effects on your physical well-being as well as your emotions. So don't keep either your endo or any other physicians you may be seeing in the dark about medications that seem to have nothing to do with the health issue they are treating -- they may work poorly with other medications.",
