            "answer": "Hi,I hope you have sorted everything out by now, and that you are pregnant and doing well :)I was searching insulin resistance on here, and came across your posting.I want to tell you about my friend's website.\u00a0\u00a0www.nutriceuticals.usana.comYou can ask your Doctor to look in the Physician's Desk Reference book.\u00a0\u00a0Usana is the only nutritional company in it!\u00a0\u00a0They have a lot of low glycemic foods - and all ingredients are quarantined to make sure they don't have anything bad in them, before making the products.Also, make sure you get lots of omega oils.\u00a0\u00a0If from fish, make sure they are \"cleaned\" of toxins.\u00a0\u00a0And calcium...25% of supplements out there have lead!!\u00a0\u00a0Some have very high levels too.\u00a0\u00a0but no level is good for us. don't be fooled by \"natural\" sources, like bovine (cow bone) or coral either. Usana's are toxin-free, and they get 5/5 in the Comparative Guide book.\u00a0\u00a0The\u00a0\u00a0site for the book is comparativeguide.com, I think. I don't think you can see the scores on there though.\u00a0\u00a0I looked in my friend's book, and things like Centrum, One a day, GNC, Shaklee, Kirkland...very low...zero - 2ish range.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe the odd score of 3.\u00a0\u00a0I can't remember for sure.\u00a0\u00a0I know Centrum was zero.anyways, if you want to order,you can order right from the site, but that's more expensive.\u00a0\u00a0I registered on it (free), and I have my vitamins sent every 4 weeks, which saves me 10%it's worth a look.oh, and fish oil helps mood...might help after you have the baby and your hormones are going crazy!all the best!",
