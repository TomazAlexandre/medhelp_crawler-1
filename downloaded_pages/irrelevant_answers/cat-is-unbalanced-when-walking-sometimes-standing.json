Our vet is mobile; I don't know if that is why she didn't run any tests on her - maybe she thought she would see if a sprain was the problem.\u00a0\u00a0We are going to keep an eye on her and call the vet tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",

    "question": "Our vet can not see our cat until tomorrow - hoping that someone might know something on the subject. Our female cat, Ella, is a 7 year old Calico.\u00a0\u00a0Just last night she was walking like someone that has too much alcohol to drink.\u00a0\u00a0Balancing over to the left when walking, some swaying to the left when standing, and when jumping up on the bed she lost her balance a little.\u00a0\u00a0She is not falling over.\u00a0\u00a0She's otherwise acting pretty normal - appetite is good, pretty sure she's using the litter box, purring, her pupils don't look dilated.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think that there is anything that she got into and because she's very fussy about her food, can't imagine that would be it.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing that was unusual is that she stayed in our bedroom last night on the floor of the foot of the bed and meowed a bit more than she normally does during the night.\u00a0\u00a0She usually has run of the rest house at night with our male cat (side note: they adore each other and do their \"kitty wrestle mania\" on a daily basis (maybe she hurt her leg during one of their bouts?). She has always walked with a sassy swinging of the hips. She's a little crazy as it is (our vet \"says that she's not wired right\")but she is one of the sweetest cats I have ever known.Please let me know if anyone has experienced anything like this.Thank you!",
