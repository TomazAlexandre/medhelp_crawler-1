            "answer": "Hello,Without examination confirmation of a diagnosis is tough but urge of frequent urination can be due to diabetes mellitus. Other possibilities are glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis(inflammation of the kidneys),urinary tract infection,hypercalcemia,hypokalemia(low potassium),hyperthyroidism and hyperparathyroidism.In my opinion, investigations like kidney functions, blood sugar levels, ultrasound lower abdomen ,intravenous pyelography , thyroid function tests and cystoscopy may be needed to confirm a diagnosis.I sincerely advise you to consult a urologist or nephrologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "Hi there,I'm a 17 year old female. For almost a year now I've been urinating really frequently. By frequent, I mean I used to urinate maybe 4/5 times a day, and now it can be anything from 15 up to 20+. And every time I do urinate, its of a normal volume. So I'm urinating a large volume overall during the day so it can't be assigned to just a psychological cause. However, I can sleep just fine during the night without waking up to go and pee. It's made a lot worse when I consume alcohol, when I do, I find myself using the toilet every 10/15 minutes or so, and I've had really bad times when its been every 5.Also recently I've become aware that when I pee, sometimes it feels cut off and like my bladder is still not completely empty, yet its not possible to urinate any more. Sometimes if I stay on the toilet for a further 15/20 minutes then I can pee the rest out, but normally I can't and just have to get up and leave.I've seen my GP twice, I've been tested for every STD, I've had a pregnancy test, I've had my urine tested for kidney problems and diabetes but my urine always comes back clear with no problems. I have no other symptoms, no pain, nothing else has changed.Does anyone know what this could possibly be? My doctor doesn't seem to know.",
