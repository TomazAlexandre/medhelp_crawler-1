            "answer": "Hello everyone. This is my second pregnancy and my daughter was born pre term at 36 weeks. My doctor told me I should take the progesterone injections (makena) starting at 16 weeks. However; I've been doing some research and it shows that Makena increases your chance of miscarriage later in pregnancy and still birth. I'm so worried. Has anyone taken this or know anyone who has? I'm not sure what to do :(",
