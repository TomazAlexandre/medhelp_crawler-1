            "answer": "Your family has obviously been through a lot with the odd symptoms. It appears that you do have a glucometer available, since his dad is a type 2 diabetic. Here is what I would suggest... write down the time and date of the 179 glucose reading and what he ate (and when) before that test. Then, for a week or two, do some more random glucose tests at home. And write down the same info -- time, date, and what time he ate before that test. I would suggest doing some fasting morning tests, some before meal tests, and some 2-hours after meal tests. See what his patterns are by doing this for a few weeks (even if the child doesn't like it -- this discomfort will go away soon), and keep a written log. Your husband surely knows what the normal glucose ranges are supposed to be, and you can get a better idea of whether there is a problem by seeing a pattern. Make sure you always wash and dry his hands thoroughly so that the tests are accurate. If you see glucose levels after meals going above the mid-140's, I would insist that his doctor run more tests for diabetes. A good doctor will listen to parents, and your written log of tests would be good evidence that things are not OK if they are running out of the normal 70-146 or so ranges.",

    "question": "I have a two year old who has been in and out of the doctors office for almost a year.\u00a0\u00a0My first thought was diabetes since his father has diabetes, even thought it is type 2.\u00a0\u00a0He urinates very frequently in large amounts, his appetite goes up and down, and he is extremely skinny, to the point you can see his hip bones in the back.\u00a0\u00a0The docs did a finger ***** and said it was within normal limits so it couldn't be diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Then we brought him back thinking maybe lead poisoning, tests were normal.\u00a0\u00a0He then started to be lethargic, falling asleep frequently.\u00a0\u00a0He was anemic and we treated with iron and lethargy improved somewhat.\u00a0\u00a0I forced the docs to run blood tests thinking maybe leukemia and those tests were normal, but his kindneys looked bad.\u00a0\u00a0His bun/creatinine ratio was three times the high normal limit.\u00a0\u00a0The docs said he must be dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0Two weeks later kidney tests improved slightly but were way outside normal limits.\u00a0\u00a0We are waiting for a pediatric GI appointment for over a month now.\u00a0\u00a0Thinking maybe malabsorption of some sort, he frequently goes between diarrhea, to messy stools, to hard pellets.\u00a0\u00a0Often when he wakes up from a nap he is very shky for a while.\u00a0\u00a0Yesterday he woke up shaky and I told my husband to check his blood sugar with a glucometer.\u00a0\u00a0He hadn't eaten anything but half a granola bar in about three hours and his blood glucose was 179.\u00a0\u00a0Now I want to ask doctor to recheck for diabetes, but I don't think doctors are taking me seriously anymore.\u00a0\u00a0Does any one have any advice other than find a new doc, which I plan to do this week?",
