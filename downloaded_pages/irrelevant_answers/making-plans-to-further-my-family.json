    "question": "I have had a Mirena IUD in place for almost 3 years now. My husband and I had talked about bringing another child into the picture since our first is about to be 4 but then he came down on deployment orders and is now in Iraq. He gets his r & r in April and I have an appointment the end of January to have my IUD removed. Am I asking too much to try and get pregnant in April or would it be more conceivable to plan on getting pregnant when he gets back for good?I know that with the paragard IUD, you can get pregnant almost as soon as it comes out because there is no hormonal influence but\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure if it is the same with the Mirena....HEP!!!!!!!!!!!!",
