            "answer": "I had gestational diabetes with my 2nd son and my numbers were never that high. I dont understand why your Dr does not seem concerned. I had to check my numbers 4 times a day and was put on a strict diet. No it was not easy, but I did not want to end up giving my self insulin shots. The highest my numbers ever got was 190 and it was only the one time. I was also monitored enery week with a stress test, and to see how big the baby was. He was delivered via c-section 1 week early because he was already so big. When he was born he was 9 9.5 oz. I think you should demand answers from your Dr.",

            "answer": "I would definitely call your doc and tell him the numbers you have. 268 is WAY to high. If you don't get any results, I'd find another doctor. Those numbers aren't good. Also, you need to cut carbs and eat protein when you do eat carbs. Carbs are sugar too. My doc had me check 5 times a day and eat 5 meals. I had to check 2 hrs after each meal. I don't want to scare you, just have them check. Have you had any high numbers like that again?good luck and take care.",

            "answer": "I have GD and have been told that if my sugars go above 200 to call the dr right away. You not only need to remoe sugar from your diet but carbs. I have been put on a strict 1900 calorie a day diet. 500 calories for each meal and 150 calories for each snack. If you look up the american diabeties association website you can read more about it and see sample menus and such. Try to stay away from greasy foods, white breads and flours, and sweets. I have to eat veggies or a salad rather than frys, or limit my intake to some form of protein and a half a banana. You should really talk to you doctor about all of this since your numbers were so high. I hope this helps and I wish you good luck!!!",

            "answer": "Thank you all for your replies. After the 268 result, I re-tested later and the number went even higher. I checked again just a few moments ago and the number was over 300 now. I thought \"something has to be wrong!\". So I read through the manual that came with the test unit (One Touch Ultra Mini) and learned how to do a 'Controlled Solution Test' to make sure the test strips and meter were working properly. The 'Test Strip Control Range' (as shown on the vial they're kept in) is 97-129mg/dl. Well the result I got from the 'Controlled Solution Test' was 273mg/dl, obviously way out of the test strip range. I looked over the strips and the solution only to see that they both expired already (I received this monitoring system brand new in the mail over a year ago just for signing up for something). With all this being said, could my result the last 24 hours be because of the expired strips or some other meter issue? I sure hope so! Otherwise, yes, I need to head down to my Dr's office and show him what's going on. Again, I did call my Dr. yesterday and told the nurse what the number was and that I was worried. She just said that my 3 hour test came back 'barely' high (155) when the cut off is 154. She said just to monitor my sugar intake. She never talked to the Dr. nor had me talk with him. My hopes are that this is all a test strip issue and not really a bad situation for the baby and I. What do you all think? Thanks. Blessings.Tasha",

            "answer": "That very well could be the problem. If the controlled test is showing high then your results probably are off. I don't know how to check it unless your doctor will run another test.. Good luck to you.",

    "question": "Hi all. I wasn't sure what topic to put this under, so here it goes- I had a 1 hour blood glucose test done a couple weeks back. A few days later the results came in HIGH and my Dr. had me go back in for a 3 hour test which the results also came back HIGH. The nurse/receptionist from my Dr.s office called and just said 'watch your sugar intake'. I asked 'meaning what exactly?' She replied 'just remove sugar from your diet'. Um, ok, easy enough..... NOT! I've been trying to do that, but almost all food/drinks have some sort of sugar in it. Still, I'm trying to watch it. Anyway, I have one of those blood sugar test kits here at home and I decided to test my blood this afternoon just for the heck of it (I've had this whole glucose on my mind for the past 2 weeks). The results showed the number 268!!!! I don't know what that means exactly, but from what I've found online, it's not good. So I called my Dr. and asked exactly how bad my numbers were when I took the 1 and 3 hour tests and what all this means. She replied that my number was only 1 above the mark where they consider it to be high- 155 (154 being the cut off) and to just watch my sugar intake. So now I'm confused! If my numbers were barely high, then what's this 268 reading all about? This is my 5th baby and I've never had any issues with the others. My last was almost 10lbs., however, and I am way overweight with this one (I'm 33, 5'4\" and 225lbs.) Does anyone else have any experience with this issue? Is this even really considered Gestational Diabetes? The nurse never used that term, I'm just assuming. I suffer from major anxiety (panic disorder) and am going through a TON of stress (no work and being evicted from our home) and this just adds to everything. Please, help me to understand these numbers. I need some peace of mind. My Dr. knows of my anxiety and just thinks I overreact to things, but I am concerned for my baby and myself, to be honest. Thanks for reading. Blessings to all.PS- I've been having a lot of headaches, back pain (sciatic is BAD!), sore feet, etc. You know, typical pregnancy stuff, especially at 6 months. However, I've been really fatigued, hot and my eyes are blurry often. Are those considered a part of this blood sugar thing or just another pregnancy related symptom? Again, my Dr. just brushes everything off as anxiety, so talking with him isn't always the best option. You get what you pay for, right? :-/",
