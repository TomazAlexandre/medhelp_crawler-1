            "answer": "Hello,Unless the cyst is painful or cosmetically unpleasant, it should not be removed. Generally no treatment is required but they become painful then it means they are infected,Then surgical excision by traditional wide excision, minimal excision, and punch biopsy excision may be required.Regarding the bend in penis, 15-20 degree bent is absolutely normal for a penis.Nothing has to be done.You will not have any problem during intercourse. Every penis is bit bent and a slight bend is normal.But if howver if your penis is bent to the left or right so much as to make it difficult or even painful to enter your partner during sex then pyrenoie disease has to be ruled out. Doppler ultrasound and Doppler vascular scan are the same.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
