            "answer": "You might still be diabetic. How old are you? You can develop type 1 later in life. It's estimated that there's like 5 milliion or so people walking around with diabetes but don't know if cause they're not symptomatic. So just because you don't more symptoms doesn't mean your not diabetic, same goes for being normo weight. Though less likely.There may be something going on with your aldosterone. Not something tested in routine bloodwork. When you get insurance, you need to see an endocrinologist asap.Good luck.",

            "answer": "You mention poor sleep, which stresses the body. A stressed body is more susceptible to problems with blood sugar. You may have a sleep disorder - your description of how you feel certainly makes it suspect. If this has been going on a while a sleep study seems reasonable.",

            "answer": "Do you have a glucometer? (Machine that you can use to check your sugars). If not, you can get a generic one at Walgreens. Check your sugar when you first wake up in the am. It should be between 70 and 105 if you're not diabetic. 105-125 you could be pre-diabetic, and over 126 diabetes is a possiblility.Type 2 Diabetes does not necessarily only happen to those with a family history, or who are overweight. It means that your body is not producing enough insulin to keep your sugars in check.You can request a lab slip from your doctor to check your fasting blood sugar, and a Hemoglobin A1C level, which will tell you your average blood sugar range from the last 10-12 weeks.Candy and sugar alone aren't the only things to raise sugar levels. Diets high in carbohydrates, especially white flour, will raise your sugar levels. Fresh fruit and fruit juices will also have this effect. Getting diagnosed as soon as possilbe will help you to feel better, and also help minimize the potential side effects. Good luck to you!Kris",

    "question": "I've read through several different lists and other than the high glucose (I'm testing 120-170) frequent dizziness and having to urinate once on the middle of each night, I don't fit the profile of a diabetic. All of those questionnaires I can answer \"no\" except the dizziness and frequent urination. But I drink 8-10 glasses of water daily.I'm normal weight range and no family history of diabetes. I don't eat candy all day, but I do enjoy an occasional sweet. I'm a vegetarian who takes her multivitamins daily and goes for morning walks. Over the past 5 years I've had two blood panels done and both times I was told everything was in a great range, perfect cholesteral, protein, etc. and my blood pressure is typically 118/70. But each time I was told the sugar seemed a little on the high side but it's probably nothing because I'm thin and in good shape, maybe it was what I ate, etc.But something is wrong with me. I'm not as sharp as I used to be. I feel a little drunk and uncoordinated at time, the way one feels when they have bad allergies. My sleep hasn't beenthe best either, on and off sleep but about 6-7 hours. Nothing solid though.I think there is something else wrong that is triggering the high glucose. Any ideas? I'll have insurance in three months but for now I'm not sure how to handle this.",
