            "answer": "Testing is the key. If you know how high or low your blood is, the best you can treat it. If she's still having a lot of trouble accepting the disease, being supportive is the best thing, and letting her have a bit of independency but also helping her when she needs it is important too. Cause she can't do it on her own.I had a period a year ago where I got really depressed, started skipping my injections to lose weight. The first thing to get damaged is the eyes, and I experienced severe blurriness. I was moody 24/7, lost weight like I wasn't eating, and was panting for breath all the time. This is where you don't want her to go. I'm not saying she will, not at all, but I so regret not managing my diabetes well. Especially with the eyes, its soooo important to take care and test your blood sugar.It takes a while to get used to such a huge life adjustment. I really wish her and you, her family, the best success. Type One ***** a lot, but she needs to know, don't let it control you, you control it. If she goes high a lot or low or whatever, it doesn't mean she's bad at managing it. I still go high almost once a week, sometimes I can't even figure out why. The only thing you can do is think about how much insulin you took, and what your blood was before you ate, if you excersised, and try to correct the mistake and learn from it, so you can do better the next time.Diabetes is only one part of who you are, it does not define you. That's important for her to know.And, it gets better. Trust me :)Hope that helped some.",

    "question": "My 11 year old daughter was diagnosed with Type 1 about 5 months ago. No one in the family has diabetes. She had suffered from stomach pains (around the navel), mouth ulcers and regularly wet the bed for as long as I can remember. She also suffered from extreme mood changes and getting her to school was an issue from day 1 usually because of the sore tummy and tiredness. We were referred to psychologists and diagnosed with anxiety several years ago. About six months ago she starred to lose weight rapidly the bed wetting got worse and she began to drink excessively, she also had some small circular patches of raised skin (but no itching)\u00a0\u00a0- I was pretty sure this was diabetes and took her to hospital\u00a0\u00a0where it was confirmed. I'm sure that there has always been an underlying autoimmune problem but most of the diabetes staff at the hospital said this was unlikely (with the exception of the specialist who said it was a possibility). She still has fairly erratic BG and suffers from regular stomach pains (upper abdomen) and mouth ulcers (not quite as bad as they used to be). When BG is high she very occasionally wets the bed. She has continued to lose weight but I think she is now stable, but has grown about an inch and a half in the past few months, so it's difficult to tell.\u00a0\u00a0She also suffers with problems with her vision particularly when BG is high and is extremely irritable ( and who can blame her!). I'd like to hear from others with similar experience. The diabetes team at the hospital are happy with her progress but I feel there are other underlying autoimmune issues.",
