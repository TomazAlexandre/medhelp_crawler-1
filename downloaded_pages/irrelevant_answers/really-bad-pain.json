            "answer": "Go to the hospital, an urgent care center, or your PCP (primary care physician) right away. This kind of pain could be a number of different things, including problems with your galbladder, liver, or possibly your spleen. The appendix is lower down in the stomach, on the lower right side.Keep in mind, while there are a lot of scary possibilities, you could also have a bad case of food poisioning, salamanila, or just gas. These conditions are all treatable, but they present painfully.Go to your doctor as soon as possible. I have liver problems and my symptoms showed the same as yours. Don't play around with your health, and please seak help.",

            "answer": "I agree with ducky and emmy.I am having almost identical pain as you and I got it checked out and this past week I was diagnosed with gall bladder disease as I have gallstones.\u00a0\u00a0I am cleared for surgery to have my gall bladder removed and I am waiting for the OR date.An ultrasound detected the gallstones I have.\u00a0\u00a0Just go into your PCP and he will order an ultrasound of your liver, pancreas, gall bladder, and kidneys. Also request some blood work to check your glucose levels, lipid panel, and liver panel.\u00a0\u00a0You can live without your gall bladder.\u00a0\u00a0But letting it go undetected can lead to an infection of the gall bladder or pancreatitis which could derail the normal functioning of the pancreas and induce diabetes or worse pancreatic cancer.\u00a0\u00a0The surgery is minimally evasive as they use robotics via a few small incisions versus a large open incision.In the meantime, try to reduce the amount of fatty, greasy foods you eat as that activates the gall bladder and if there are gallstones in there, the gall bladder's activation makes you very sick.femmy",
