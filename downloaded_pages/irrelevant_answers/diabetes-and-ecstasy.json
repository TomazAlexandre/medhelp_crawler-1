I wonder why, if you have over educated yourself on what Ecstasy does to non-diabetics, you would even consider taking it.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you good luck on making the right choice.",

            "answer": "Hi Hollywood,I don't know if you have other health issues, but there's no reason that having a drink once or twice a year would be any worse than taking Ecstasy a couple times a year!My husband has been Type 1 for over 15 years and he has a beer with dinner several times a week. In fact, we just returned from a Beer Tasting event in Denver. He checks is bs and adjusts his insulin as needed. He has excellent control and his Ha1c is always below 7. So, it can be done safely.Of course, I'm not advocating that everyone who is diabetic go ahead and drink! As long as it's in moderation, it can be controlled.I'd think that would be safer for you than Ecstasy.",

            "answer": "Dear Hollywood5150,I am not a doctor and can't give you medical advice, but I have researched ecstasy in the past. My knowledge comes from my son attending raves or club's in his past and his understanding that this is something very dangerous for him. We were lucky he decided to not try it.It can cause dehydration, which can bring on heart failure with anyone, not to mention someone with type 1.I would also like to bring up the issue that when you try a street drug you never know the substance's that are included. The damage can be be lasting or fatal.As an adult in your 30's, I truly hope you think about this. You also need to protect your kidney's (and this is another concern).I do wish you the best and would like to hear back from you.dm",

            "answer": "I totally agree with the fact that drinking and taking ecstasy probably have about the same risk levels when associated with Type 1 Diabetes...I am a Type1 and I can tell you that both rarely produce adverse affects on blood sugar if they are taken with care and understanding of how blood sugar WILL react while taking part in such activities..With drinking, be sure to eat something beforehand.. or if you don't be sure to snack at the bar, separate drinks with water, and drink one or two of your drinks without diet or soda.. tonic has about the same calories as a full-sugar soda. I drink vodka-soda with half soda/half sprite. Also.. If I drink.. I always make sure to take my night insulin and have a good bit to eat without fast acting insulin and some good hydration before passing out.. I always play it safe and make sure I'm close to 180ish before going to bed as sugars may continue to drop overnight. It isn't surprising for me to go to bed with a bg of 230 and wake up in the high 70s and low 80s..Treat ecstasy the same way you would if you weren't diabetic. Be sure to keep hydrated. Make sure you test often.. because the high may cause you to be unresponsive to lows or not recognize them as easily. Finally, be sure to take your night insulin, drink some water and sleep as long as necessary to feel rested afterward.As with any recreation, precede with care and have a great understanding on BG. It baffles me the people that have this disease and don't fully understand it. I could not live with this and not know as much as I can about it. And once you figure out YOUR diabetes.. it's cake. Just another routine with meals and at bedtime.Good luck in your mischief! :)",

Second as above stated, start slow and just don't be stupid with it.

            "answer": "MDMA raises your Blood Glucose levels. If your blood sugar levels are not well managed, taking the drug could send you into DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis), which requires hospitalization. Taking the drug and dancing dehydrates you, making you more susceptible to DKA. Vomiting and stomach pain is a symptom of DKA. The more you vomit, the less you are able to control your BG levels and you require sick day management. After a bout with DKA, your BG levels do wild swings, making testing like nailing jello to a wall. DKA can kill a diabetic - and in the best case scenario, it can make you feel like crap and rack up huge hospital and ambulance bills. Alcohol and MDMA makes the jello analogy even worse. There are so many things you can experience in life without risking your life - if your child was a diabetic, would you want them to take a risk that could potentially kill them if it wasn't necessary? I don't think so. Don't take the chance. Accept that diabetes is a disease that can manifest itself in many different ways - put those negative aspects can be prevented. You are not immortal and never will be. You can try to be at age 30, but you probably won't make it to 60. Bag the MDMA and go climb a mountain or sky dive - the risk is much less.",
