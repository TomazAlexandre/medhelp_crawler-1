    "question": "I am asking here because I feel like a nerd talking to my Dr. I don't want to become a pest.First of I never complain how I feel, but things are happening that seem to be important enough to ask about.\u00a0\u00a0I am hoping you all can say its nothing don't bother mentioning it.I decided to tell my Dr that I was having trouble with dropping things, or it would take a few tries to grab something.She ran some tests and my thyroid did come back of and I am now being treated for that.But my hand problem is still quite the same, my thyroid levels are normal they were tested 6 days ago.3 weeks ago I had an episode of vertigo, it was very brief lasted maybe a few minutes I was nausous, afterwards I was very tired and my eyes bothered me (which I assume would).Then it accurd to me that it also happened 5 weeks before that, same thing.I have had CBC, TSH, and comprehensive metabolic done all was normal.My question is...Is this at all worth mentioning to my Dr.?The past three days my eyes feel like they want to cross it is annoying.I haven't ever had vertigo before and I'm not sure if I will ever get it again.The hand dropping thing has been going on for at least a year or more.Thnakyou",
