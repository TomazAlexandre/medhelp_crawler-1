            "answer": "I have a 15 months old as well and I'm just starting my 9th week of pregnancy, however I lost 2 pounds. Sorry, I'm not saying it to put anyone down, just trying to say that there are different pregnancies and so many things effect your body, like hormonal changes where some future moms release different quantities of hormones that effect them differently.No starvation! Just eat healthy foods, and less in quantity but more frequent, also snack a lot: keep little bags of celery, baby carrots, broccoli, almonds etc. and snack a lot. Plus, go on daily walks with your toddler. Put him in the stroller and go. We walk once to two times for about an hour each, he goes to playground, plays, runs and I go with him. Fun and healthy for both. Also, call your ob and see what they say, maybe you have pregnancy diabetes or something that makes your body want to ea and store food. Good luck!!!!",
