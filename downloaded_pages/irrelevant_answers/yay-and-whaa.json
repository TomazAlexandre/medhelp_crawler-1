I'm exercising this time around and have actually lost weight but I'm still worried. I'm overweight. I'm pretty curvy. My mom had it too. But she only had it with her 1st baby and not with the other 2. That kind of gives me hope. I also don't feel like I have it this time around. I don't get the low blood sugar shakes or anything.There's hope for the both of us. :)",
