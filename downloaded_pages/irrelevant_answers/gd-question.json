            "answer": "I found out at 29 weeks that I had GD also, went to the dr yesterday for my appointment and he put me on a diet... no medication for me unless the diet doesn't work. I am 30+4. I was so scared at first because I was reading that it can make your baby gain too much weight which meant the dr would probably induce labor so I asked my dr and he said if my daughter does start gaining too much weight that they probably would have to induce me and a possible c-section... I'd stay away from sugars if I were you...",

    "question": "Well yesterday my Dr pretty much told me I have gestational diabetes I am 30+5. I went in yesterday for a check up and everything went well but not even an hour after I left the office my Dr called and told me she didn't know how she missed it when I was there but there was glucose in my urine. I have to go back in for blood woork today and she started me on 500 mg of metformin a day. At this point I have no idea what to expect I don't know what I should be eating on Monday I have an appointment for Diabeteic Ed at the hospital. What should I be doing and what should I be eating to better myself? Also if I have gd does that mean they will try and induce labor early?",
