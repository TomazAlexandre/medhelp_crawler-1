            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Recurrent boils are seen in a skin disease called Hidradenitis suppurativa, which presents as recurrent boil-like pus-like discharge abscesses resulting in difficult-to-heal open wounds and scarring.It can also be due to staphylococcal skin infections.If your blood sugar is high as in diabetes, then too you can get recurrent boils.You can treat this by applying a warm cloth to the area. This encourages the pus to come to the surface and drain. Once the boil has drained, the area should be washed with antibacterial soap and an antibacterial cream applied and kept dry, bandaged and sterile.\u00a0\u00a0It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor preferably a skin specialist.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
