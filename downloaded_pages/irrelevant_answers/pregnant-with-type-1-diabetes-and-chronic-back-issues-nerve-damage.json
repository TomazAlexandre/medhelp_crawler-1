            "answer": "I'm 22 years old and I also have major back problems with nerve damage and I had major back surgery a year ago.. I was on a Ton of meds for it when I found out I was pregnant. I went to see a physician because the midwife I spoke to was horrible. The first thing she asked was \"do u plan on keeping it\" she made me petrified. My personal preference of course but i dont believe in abortion. I wanted nothing to do with her.. I then was seen by my now ob and he has done everything he can to make sure I'm having a healthy pregnancy. He worked hand in hand with the pain clinic I attend and I weaned off everything except a small dose of pain medicine.. I was on neurontin, cymbalta, amitriptyline, xanex, baclofen. So far my baby's been growing as planed and he said I'm having an.extreemly healthy pregnancy. If your not comfortable with your ob you always have the option to switch. My ob said he's had patients on neurontin and everything else I was on and they had perfectly healthy babies.If you want this pregnancy don't give up. I think you and your baby will be just fine.I'm now almost 17 weeks and the pain clinic is trying different methods to help me with my nerve and back pain.Whatever you decide I wish you the best of luck! You'd be surprised what our babies and ourselves can do under any condition.Message me any time! Goodluck",

            "answer": "My OB is honestly clueless, She point blank said I dont deal with this other stuff I specialize in this area down here....This was the first time I have ever seen her because my OB left the office to go to another state or I would have followed him. I wouldnt expect her to understand all of it but she should at least understand the meds I am on, I live in a very small area and there are not many drs around. The perinatal dr I am going to see in august is 3 hours away. Thanks for your advice, every little bit helps : )",

            "answer": "I know my ob is a primary care physician as well as an ob so someone like that might be better suited for your needs. I know a lot of midwifes dont deal with people on meds and such because they have no idea how to handle it.Hopefully the high risk Dr can better address your concerns! Best of luck.. keep me updated x0x",

    "question": "I recently found out I was pregnant, at the time 10 weeks and had absolutly no clue. I was told last fall I was premenopause due to right ovary removed and periods had been hit or miss for quite awhile. Needless to say it was quite a shock. Especially considering my health, I have low back issues, have had major back surgery, permenent nerve damage that affects my legs and also was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes a year and a half ago at the age of 27. I have been on medication for my back issues for almost 2 years, I take Norco 10/325 4 times a day and Neurontin 300 mgs 3 times a day. I am scared to death over this pregnancy at this time I am just about 13 and a half weeks and while the norco is a class 3, so is the neurontin but the neurontin has been known to cause pretty serious birth defects. It is not well known but there are studies out there, Neurontin is an anti seizure med. Besides the risks of birth defects with the diabetes, there are risks to myself with the diabetes and pregnancy as well. I already have a son and step daughter, I am very very nervous about continuing this pregnancy ( I dont need any lectures I have beat myself up over this already ) My OB left so now I have a fill in who doesnt have a clue, my OB had told me previously I am not a canidate for pregnancy, Way too many issues. The fill in is refering me to a high risk dr who can not see me until august where I will be 18 weeks. By that time, I just dont know. Has anyone been in this situation?? My concern is besides the high risk meds, the risks to myself, Not all birth defects can be known prior to the birth. If something major is missed, then what?",
