            "answer": "I am pregnant for the first time right now, 36 weeks 4 days, and am 36\u00a0\u00a0years old. I was 35 when I got pregnant. I was told at 18 that I wouldn't be able to have children (I have PCOS) and when I was 33, the dr said that it might be possible if I took fertility drugs. I took Clomid for 3 months last year and on the third month taking it, I finally conceived. I was labeled high risk from the onset. I was 35 years old, have diabetes and\u00a0\u00a0high blood pressure, am overweight,\u00a0\u00a0and I only have one kidney. I have made it to 36 weeks now and have not had one single problem as was suspected. I am still treated as high risk and have ultrasounds every week as well as non-stress tests every week and will be induced in 16 days, but it was the best decision that I have ever made.",

            "answer": "Don't let the \"over 35\" thing scare you. It's just a generalization. Yes, there could be issues but there can be issues with any pregnancy. I am 36 and pregnant with my 3rd. (We have a 6yo and 2yo.) I thought for sure we were done after our last so it came as a little bit of a surprise but I am excited now. I currently am just about 8 weeks along. I had problems with my blood pressure with both of my prior pregnancies so I am keeping my fingers crossed that this will be different. Only time will tell. Only good thing is that I am in a different place in my life now and there is way less stress. Everyone is different so don't let a generalized age get you worried. Plenty of women who are much older have babies that are totally healthy.",
