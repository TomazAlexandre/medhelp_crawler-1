            "answer": "Well, despite the extensive examinations it really does sound like a pinched nerve to me, based on the symptoms you describe and the fact that at night (when you're relaxed and relatively immobile) it eases and then once your up and about, it comes back. You've already had a hernia eliminated, which was the other immediate thought I had.\u00a0\u00a0Sadly, the process of elimination diagnosis that's taking place now suggests that its a tricky one to tie down.A neurologist isn't mentioned in your list of consultants and that's probably where I would go next.Good luck!MrJ",

            "answer": "Thanks for your feedback. I forgot to mention that I went to a neuorologist, too. I had a nerve stimulation test that was normal, although he said it doesn't always mean there isn't a pinch somewhere. He gave me a prescription for some nerve relaxant meds, but I haven't tried them yet. Does the meds sound like a good idea to you?",

            "answer": "I think you should try the meds, as there is good reason to believe they may help (hence the prescription for them).\u00a0\u00a0Even if the meds make no difference, that is still useful information from an investigative point of view.Good luck!-MrJ",

    "question": "I am 52, weigh 200 lbs., healthy overall. For over a year now I have been experiencing generalized pain in my pelvic area. It's fine when I wake up in the morning, but a soreness/pain sensation covers the pelvic area as the day goes on. Occasionally I have simultaneous pain in my very low back, almost to the tailbone. This discomfort is in my upper inner thighs too, with a swollen/rubbing sensation, although no swelling is visible.I have noticed that when I have this discomfort I sometimes have mild pain in some of my toe joints and some other joints at the same time.I have had every kind of test from colonsocopy, to 3 MRIs of my back, scrotal ultrasound, MRI of pelvis/lower abdomen, tests for diabetes, thyroid, etc. and all are negative. My only medical issue is sizable hemorrhoids (appear during bowel movement) that I have had for many years. I have been to my internist, a gastroentronologist, urologist, physiatrist, rheumatologist, and have gone for physical therapy. I was checked for hernia and had a digital exam for the prostate.I have been given Mobic, Celebrex, Naproxen and Tylenol. They work for a while, then seem to stop working. The discomfort lasts all day, somewhat better at night. I sleep fine and the next day the cycle starts all over again. It's not activity dependent. Sometimes I get a pang of pain for few seconds at different location in the pelvic area.Really am very frustrated and wonder if anyone else has heard of this, what it might be, and what kind of diagnostic doctor can figure this out.",
