            "answer": "No labs yet.\u00a0\u00a0Essentially this is my \"start out\" dose after the TT and I normally wouldn't change until I'd tried it for 6 weeks then had labs.\u00a0\u00a0When I saw her about my calcium at my 2 week followup after surgery she raised it because she felt her partner had prescribed way to low a dose.\u00a0\u00a0I'm just concerned about the fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0My son is ADHD so stimulants relax him.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I wondered if too high a Synthroid dose did that to me instead of energizing me.\u00a0\u00a0I'm just wondering if anyone started low, was raised and felt worse initially then felt better on the higher dose.\u00a0\u00a0In the long run I guess it's better than heart palpitations but I could really use more energy now rather than later.",

            "answer": "Unfortunately, it may take time for you to find your magic number. It is important for your endo to treat your frees, FT4/FT3 levels. SA is a diabetes city, and most endos specialize in diabetes, NOT thyroid.If you are still feeling low after your numbers are adjusted, and your endo doesn't help you, I can recommend a WONDERFUL thyroid doc.:) Tamra",

    "question": "I had a TT 10/1 and did pretty well other than feeling miserable in the hospital and the first few days home.\u00a0\u00a0I started on 112 Synthroid and had some fatigue but made it through the day even when my husband went out of town for work 10 days after my surgery.\u00a0\u00a0At my appt with my actual endo (her partner saw me in the hospital) I mentioned the fatigue and she raised me to 150.\u00a0\u00a0I was excited at first hoping to see an energy increase then freaked out that night worried I'd be too crazy in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0I took the higher dose last Friday and felt pretty good until afternoon when I crashed.\u00a0\u00a0Yesterday I felt tired all day along with brain fog.\u00a0\u00a0Today, good in the morning but once again out of it by afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0True to form I have a surge of energy at bedtime.Could I be worse on the higher dose?\u00a0\u00a0Is my body reacting to the big jump and instead of energy I'm zapped.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone had a slump when increased then had it start working better?\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure if I should call the doctor or give it more time.\u00a0\u00a0My calcium is also not bouncing back, although they actually lowered my intake to try and get my body to work on it's own (???)\u00a0\u00a0My husband is leaving again this week so I need enough energy to take care of my 2 kids.\u00a0\u00a0I was so looking forward to being mildly hyper and getting some things accomplished around the house but instead I feel like I've gone hypo instead!",
