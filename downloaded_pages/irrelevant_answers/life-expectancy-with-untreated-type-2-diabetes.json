            "answer": "With blindness, amputated legs and kidney failure, how long would he actually want to live? I'm assuming the hypertension is also untreated? What is your husband's issue with doctors? Why doesn't he want to take care of his health? Do you have children? You might want to ask him why he wants to leave his children without a father? I can't quote stats, though I'm sure you can find them if you do a search. But your husband is looking at a foreshortened and miserable life.",

            "answer": "Btw, just fyi you are posting in the type 1 forum, not the type 2 forum.I'm so sorry, mamarou, and unfortunately don't have any suggestions. Denial is a very powerful thing and people use all their \"logic\" to maintain it. All you can do is tell him how much his behavior hurts and scares you. He will probably see any efforts to change his thinking as \"nagging or overreacting\". He is the one that needs to make the decision to change. All you can do is perhaps leave him some information around the house without comment. If you are unwilling to live like this and are thinking of leaving that may knock some sense into him, but ultimatums are not meaningful unless you really feel that way. I personally would not want to stay and watch someone kill themselves by neglecting their health any more than if they were doing it with drugs or alcohol. But I don't have a history and love for such a person, so I can't walk in your shoes. Another option is to say you need the two of you to have counseling so you have support in talking about these issues. IMHO people who are in that kind of denial are usually terrified underneath and react by pretending their is no problem. Unfortunately it won't go away but they will just dig their heels in deeper to anyone who tries to take away their \"protection\". The sad part of it? Diabetes is a manageable condition and complications are only inevitable if you ignore it.With numbers like 368 and 670 he most likely has ketones in his urine which can produce a condition called DKA which is life-threatening. DKA is less common in Type 2's than Type 1's but not unheard of. If he begins to vomit and experience flu-like symptoms he needs to go to the ER right away. At 10 years it is possible that he is now a type 2 that no longer produces enough insulin and we need insulin to live.That might be a good thing because it would bring him to his senses.Best of luck to you, you are indeed in a rough situation and it's sad because it is so unnecesary!",
