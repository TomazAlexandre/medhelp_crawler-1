            "answer": "Hello,The diarrhea could be a side effect from the Metformin, which is quite common. Alternatively, it could be a viral illness, which would also explain your higher glucose numbers. If it continues past a week, I suggest speaking to your doctor about possible side effects form the medication, or work-up of GI illnesses that are sometimes more common in people with diabetes. In the meantime try to stay hydrated and stay with bland foods.Take care.",
