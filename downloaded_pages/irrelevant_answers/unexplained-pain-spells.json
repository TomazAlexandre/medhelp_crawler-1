I happened to find this when wondering about my grandfather in-law who was also diagnosed with diabetes.I do hope you feel better. Take *good* care of yourself.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with diabetes recently. I'm not sure that has anything to do with this pain, but the diagnosis occurred in the hospital where I had gone with a severe unexplained pain spell that I was sure was a heart attack. The pain was in my left chest, radiating around to the back and down the arm. But after tests it turned out my heart is in excellent shape, so they couldn't explain the pain otherwise. Since then I've had several \"spells\" every week in different parts of my body. They are excruciating and last -- except for that first one that stayed a couple of hours -- from two to 10 minutes on average. What makes it so hard to figure, though, is that they move around so much. Sometimes the pain is in my left upper body, sometimes my right leg, sometimes my lower back, sometimes my right arm. However, I'm sure the spells are related because the pain feels the same: excruciating, burning, as if every cell in that part of my body is hurting. Yesterday I had one across my upper body. I could even feel pain in my nipples, and it was so bad it made both arms virtually useless. I have a high pain tolerance but it hurt so bad it made me cry. My husband wanted to take me to the hospital, but I knew it would pass before we even got to the car, and sure enough was gone in a few minutes. Any ideas anyone?",
