            "answer": "Hello,Common causes causing erection problem are stress and anxiety, poor communication with your partner, unrealistic sexual expectations, negative feelings about non performance, smoking, alcohol and sometimes illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, spinal or neurological causes. In your case varicocele can be responsible for such symptoms.Firstly, you should consult a physician to find out the cause of the erectile dysfunction and then only seek treatment. Viagra is a drug which can be used to take care of the erectile dysfunction but it should be taken only after consultation with a physician . It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
