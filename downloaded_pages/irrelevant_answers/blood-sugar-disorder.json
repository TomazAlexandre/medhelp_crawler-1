            "answer": "I'm not sure what your question is.During the course of an examination a physician normally explores many aspects of a patient's life, to include recommendations on diet, exercise and medication.I am sure there will be additional testing after your wife has been on this medication for a while.The prescription is reasonable, relatively safe, and, other things being equal, there seems no reason to simply change doctors.",

            "answer": "I'm curious to know why you are posting and not your wife since it is her with a condition not you?When in doubt it never hurts to get a second opinion, especially when a doctor dispenses pills rather than advice. Your wife's \"fbs\" [I'm assuming fasting blood sugar] indicates prediabetes. This can be corrected with proper diabetes nutrition, maintaining proper weight and daily physical exercise.Does \"pp\" stand for postprandial? Without knowing when, or how the 256 mg/dl test results came about your wife should ask the next doctor, preferably an Endocrinologist - a diabetes specialist - for1. A1c test [HgBA1c, HbA1c] - gives a more reasonable view of the glucose [blood sugar] over the past 3 months. Normal is <5%.2. Pancreas Insulin test3. Thyroid TSH test - a malfunctioning thyroid may disrupt pancreas insulin productionThese tests will help the doctor determine why her postprandial levels are so high.",
