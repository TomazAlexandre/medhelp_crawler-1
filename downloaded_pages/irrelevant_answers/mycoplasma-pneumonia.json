            "answer": "Thank you very much. I forgot to mention that I am female and 76 years old, not that that alters anything. You have given me confidence to find an answer. One other thing: it isn't menopausal as at least 2 doctors (here in NYC) suggested. Last year I was put on an estrogen/provera regimen for 8 mos. The sweats, flushing and low grade fever continued. May I ask you: should I be looking toward the Mayo Clinic for answers or do you know if there is a \u201cplace\u201din New York City where I can get an evaluation? So far, with 3 different doctors, I have struck out.",

    "question": "I have had a chronic sweating problem for over 2 years. It will go from a flushed feeling to water dripping from the top of my head down my body. I have a chronic bronchitis condition as well as asthma. I have a low grade fever that ranges between 99. F to 100.2 F. My \u201cnormal\u201d temperature ranges from 97. to 98. This fever has also been with me for a long time. I also have a persistent cough ranging from phlegmy to dry. Last year, 2006 in January, my doctor said I had mycoplasma pneumonia and prescribed Biaxcin for a month. The flushing and sweats continued. In September 2007, after blood testing, he said I had mycoplasma pneumonia and this time prescribed Doxycycline Hyclat for a month, 2 x's a day. I am in the 3rd week of taking antibiotics. While the cough has lessened, I still have the low grade fever. Activity does aggravate the sweating and flushing. I also feel fatigue and mental listlessness. I have been on Prozac for 20 years, now at 40mg per day. Am I shadow-boxing or am I ill? I truly do not know if I am mentally causing these terribly distracting (though not life-threatening) symptoms. Can you give me any help and/or advice?",
