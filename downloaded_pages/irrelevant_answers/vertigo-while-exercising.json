            "answer": "Hi,With a medical history of post nasal drip and a possible sinus infection, it is best to have a consult done with an ENT specialist. Vertigo may be due to an inner ear problem that may be secondary to an infection .Other causes may be vascular insufficiencies or a component of a basilar migraine. A complete work up may be essential . A carotid doppler scan and examination of the peripheral vessels in the extremities may help. Decreased blood flow to the brain due to vascular deficiencies, hypertension,diabetes or some heart ailments have to be ruled out.Take lots of water and avoid vigorous exercises until you have been completely assessed.",
