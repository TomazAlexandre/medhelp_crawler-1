As well as dangerously high blood pressure.Ask them to test you ASAP! It can kill both you and the baby. It causes women to stroke out or have a heart attackOR it could be complications of your GD... i'd suggest you ask about it.",

She went in yesterday and they said her b/p and urine was fine it was just the joys of pregnancy. She is afraid to ask to be induced or have her membranes striped even though she is ready for her to come this is her last week of work so I think it should get better . Good luck to you.",

    "question": "I am due in 3 weeks, and lately i've become very very swollen and my hands and feet are triple the size they used to be. My hands also feel very tingling and times and i can't even hold a pen for how much it hurts. I have an appointment with my OB tomorrow and i was wondering if its a good idea to ask if i can be induced or if something can be done. I also have gestational diabetes that sometimes can get out of control, even with the diet.What do you think?",
