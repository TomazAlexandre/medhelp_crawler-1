            "answer": "Prednisone is known to elevate glucose levels, especially when taken over a period of time. From what I have read after the first two to four weeks of treatment, your doctor will gradually decrease your dosage depending on your symptoms and the results of sed rate and C-reactive protein tests. For now you should speak with your Endocrinologist about adjusting your diabetes medication until you're off of Prednisone.",

            "answer": "As an alternative to prednisone I suggest you research the adviseability of using medical grade DSMO, a powerful anti-inflammatory. There is controversy in the conventional medical community. Only use medical grade (diluted) DSMO.20 mg of daily prednisone is a high daily dose. In addition to elevated glucose levels adrenal atrophy and an increased liklihood of a malignancy are possibilities.In addition, you shoud be screened for an HERV-W infection.",

    "question": "My sugar is out of control.\u00a0\u00a0I'm on insulin plus pills, but my question really has to do with prednisone, 20/mg daily, which I have to take for Polymyalgia Rheumatica, an extremely painful muscle disease.\u00a0\u00a0 Without the pred. I literally cannot walk.\u00a0\u00a0My sugar has been in the 300's & 400s no matter what I do - I've heard prednisone can wreak havoc with diabetes and I'd like to know if perhaps this is why my sugar level is so high?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
