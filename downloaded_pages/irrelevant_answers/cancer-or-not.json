If it's caused by the medication it could take a few months for his body to adjust; or he may need to change one or more of his medications before the symptoms will improve. It's best to discuss bothersome symptoms with his doctor and decided if a medication adjustment would be helpful. I wish you and him all the best.",

    "question": "I have some questions referring to my dad who is sick.Last night my step-brother called the ambulance because his stomach pain has gotten worse. This is not his first time going to the hospital. This is probably his third or fourth time. The first time he went to the hospital, the doctor told him that he has stomach cancer. Later they said he doesn't have it. I wasn't there to know all the information, but from bits and pieces I heard, they said there was no blood in his pancreas and they stuck a tube down his throat.Last time I heard, he has type diabetes 2, high blood pressure, and something else which I don't know. The doctor gave him five different medicine to help him (mainly to use the bathroom) and Non-insulin shots for his diabetes. He has lost a lot of weight, very weak and tired (but he can still drive, weird!). He uses the bathroom a lot, so he is constantly dehydrated but he is drinking tons of water at the same time.Is there any way to know what is causing his stomach pains? His stomach pain caused him to lose a lot of weight and energy.",
