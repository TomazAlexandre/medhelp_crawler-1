            "answer": "Hi Rochelle,Congratulations on your new child!1)What is causing the chest pain - could it be angina?You are not the typical angina patient (young, no risk factors mentions like high blood pressure, diabetes, family history, smoking, cholesterol), but anything is possible and deserves to be worked up a physicain.\u00a0\u00a0A face to face interaction is usually necessary to decide how far to take the work up for chest pains in a young person.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully your physician is addressing your concerns.2) What does 'Q-wave III' mean (this was on my notes following a recent EKG).an isolated Q in lead III means very little.\u00a0\u00a0It depends on the other leads.3)What is triggering the tachycardia and is it dangerous to keep having these episodes?The first step is to document the tachycardia with a monitor (24 hour holter monitor, event monitor, or preferrably a 12 lead EKG).\u00a0\u00a0Once its documented, we have a better idea of the cause.\u00a0\u00a0The differential is quite broad.\u00a0\u00a0More information is required to narrow down the options.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like they haven't started the basic work up yet--I am sure your cardiologist will do that.I hope you feel better soon and good luck.",

    "question": "Hi,I am 31, female, 5'6, 168lb, don't smoke or drink, not taking any meds.\u00a0\u00a0I gave birth in May.\u00a0\u00a0Since then, I've had chest pains every day of differing types, lots of PVC's (which I never felt before giving birth) and I keep having bouts of tachycardia, which start ususally when I'm resting or asleep. These will come on suddenly and last for a few hours, sometimes a day or so.\u00a0\u00a0My resting pulse is usually 80 and during the tachy episodes it will go to around 150.\u00a0\u00a0The other day when walking, I got a heavy pain in my chest above my left breast which stopped when I rested, then started again as soon as I started walking.\u00a0\u00a0So my questions are:\u00a0\u00a01)What is causing the chest pain - could it be angina.\u00a0\u00a02) What does 'Q-wave III' mean (this was on my notes following a recent EKG).\u00a0\u00a03)What is triggering the tachycardia and is it dangerous to keep having these episodes?\u00a0\u00a0These episodes are making me anxious and afraid, I have constant palpitations and can always hear my heartbeat in my head.\u00a0\u00a0I would be grateful for some advice - I am seeing a cardiologist next week and can you offer any advice on the questions I should ask.\u00a0\u00a0Many Thanks.",
