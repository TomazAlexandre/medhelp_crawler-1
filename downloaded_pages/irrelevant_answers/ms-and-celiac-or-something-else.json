    "question": "Dr.Nicholson,My question is: I'm in limbo and have been for almost 2 years officially,questionable for MS,however,I'm seeing an Neuro and the few lesions I have are not prominent for MS when brain mri was done without contrast,cervical/spine clear and LP clear. My BP is normal, thryroid fine, diabetes negative, low vit-D,vit B is finebut I did have tingling in mostly R side of body, blurry vision(5-6 yrs ago, one eye went black for almost an hour with bright flashes before black and to date I've went from 15/20 vision to 25/30 and I do not have many headaches, I have extreme fatigue, I had trouble with cognitive problems a couple of times that lasted a few days or longer,after mri's were done and the sun bothers me now and showers that are more than luke warm.Sometimes my walking is off, so now,current Neuro does not feel it is MS but not sure as to what and he sent me to MS specialist back in June and she did not listen and just went by the mri's that were done a year ago and said it was not MS and i need to lose alittle weight and with being 42 yrsold that had alot to do with it.Finally, my neuro is allowing me to have another brain mri with and w/out contrast this month.I'm stumped as to what this is.\u00a0\u00a0I did have a Chiro/wellness doc test me for gluten/wheat etc and I'm allergic and I've deleted them from my diet and some symptoms have lessened it seems.Should I let this go as being just Celiac related or keep pursuing answers for MS or any suggestions?I'm truly grateful for any help or insight on this,Many blessings,Tammy",
