            "answer": "Hello,Burning feet and lumps under the feet can have several different causes like you may be having sensitivity to the fabric or leather dye in your shoes or socks, or even the detergent used to wash your socks. Also it can be due to improper socks textile.It may be due to calluses also. A callus is a rough, thickened patch of skin.They occur most often on the heels and balls of the feet, the knees, and the palms of the hands. However, they can develop on any part of the body that is subject to repeated pressure or irritation.After walking, immediately change out of your shoes and socks, allowing the shoes to dry.You can use warm compresses and anti inflammatory pain relievers such as aspirin or acetaminophen ( if you are not allergic to aspirin). Try changes in your shoes, socks, and insoles and rotate your shoes and socks, both between walking sessions.If the symptoms still persist then pls consult a physician for a thorough check up and diagnosis to rule out peripheral vascular disease and diabetes.Hope it helps.Take care and regards.",
