My son was 10 lbs 3 oz and I had him vaginally and it was rough because he got stuck in the birth canal and being that I had a midwife they just had me keep pushing for 4 1/2 hours rather than give me a c-section. I cannot imagine having a 15 lb baby! I'm assuming she had a c-section but even so carrying that baby around for the last few months must have been awful! She deserves some kind of award for that haha",
