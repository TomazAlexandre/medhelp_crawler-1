            "answer": "It most likely means that you have an autoimmune disorder called Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.\u00a0\u00a0With Hashi's the immune system erroneously determines that the thyroid gland is \"foreign\" to the body and produces antibodies to attack and eventually destroy the gland.\u00a0\u00a0Along the way, your TSH level will continue to rise trying to stimulate the gland to produce thyroid hormone.\u00a0\u00a0The gland's output of hormone is gradually diminished, requiring increasing dosage of thyroid meds to offset the loss of natural thyroid hormone.When you go for additional tests be sure to insist on Free T3 and Free T4, the biologically active thyroid hormones (not the same as Total T3 and Total T4).\u00a0\u00a0 As Free T3 and Free T4 levels drop toward the lower part of their ranges, hypo symptoms begin to become noticeable.\u00a0\u00a0Are you having any hypo symptoms yet?One thing further, is that hypo patients are frequently too low in the ranges for Vitamin D, B12 and ferritin.\u00a0\u00a0So it would be a good idea to test those as well.When you have more test results, if you want, please post those, along with ranges shown on the lab report, and members will be glad to help interpret and advise further.",

Since you have the antibodies that would be the basis for a diagnosis of Hashimoto's, so we know that eventually, as gimel pointed out, your thyroid production will begin declining.\u00a0\u00a0At this point, it may be difficult to find a specialist willing to start you on replacement hormones. Your naturopath might be the best bet to get you on a trial dose to see if it helps.Is hunger and the weight issue the only symptom you're having? Other symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, slowed heart rate, hair loss, acid reflux (GERD), puffiness around the eyes, joint/muscle aches/pains, anxiety, heart palps.Common symptoms of being hyper include weight loss, diarrhea, hand tremor, rapid heart rate, heart palps, mood swings, irritability, anxiety, bulging eyes.\u00a0\u00a0This is not a complete list of symptoms for either hypo or hyper and as you can see, there are some symptoms that apply to both.Have you been tested for diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Waking hunger is sometimes a symptom of fasting glucose impairment. General hunger could be due to not eating enough protein, since protein, typically, fills you up and keeps you feeling fuller, longer.\u00a0\u00a0I find that taking an HCl with pepsin capsule with meals helps absorb protein better and I don't get so hungry; check with your doctor.",

            "answer": "Yes, you're probably right about the CG - probably supposed to be hCG, which is present in the placenta when one is pregnant.Good that you keep your labs for 3 yrs, but you should actually keep them longer than that - I have all of mine going back to about 2000 and I can see it's it's back, at least, that far and I know further yet, but previous doctors didn't give me the labs, that doctors started messing up on my treatmentsIf you didn't have an iron panel prior to starting the iron supplements, on basis did your naturopath recommend them?Even at 37, your ferritin level is too low.\u00a0\u00a0It needs to be up in the 50-60 range.\u00a0\u00a0Ferritin is an iron storage hormone, not the same thing as iron.\u00a0\u00a0When ferritin is low, it's an indicator that iron is low.\u00a0\u00a0When ferritin levels are low, an iron panel, which includes iron, Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC) and transferrin should be done.\u00a0\u00a0Some iron panels will include unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) or transferrin saturation, if other conditions are suspected.The fasting glucose test appears to be an hB A1c test, which measures blood glucose over a period of about 3 months... your level is non-diabetic, but most labs consider 5.6-5.7 to be borderline for type II diabetes.As I noted, many symptoms can apply to both hyper and hypo, it's not enough to say you've had symptoms of hyper and hypo.\u00a0\u00a0Depression is one of those can apply to either.\u00a0\u00a0As has been noted, your current thyroid levels don't look bad at all, but you could be seeing some of the beginning effects of Hashimoto's destruction of your thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Its' not unusual for symptoms to be present for some time before labs (FT3, FT4 and TSH) actually indicate an issue.\u00a0\u00a0Talk to your doctor or naturopath and see if either would be willing to start you on a trial dose of thyroid replacement hormones to see if that will alleviate any of your symptoms. I'd guess your naturopath might be more most likely to be willing to do this.As gimel noted in his first post, your ALT is slightly elevated and is probably nothing to worry about.\u00a0\u00a0Mild elevation is considered to be 2-3 times the normal level (yours is < twice the normal level) and can be caused by a number of things, including fatty liver caused by obesity, diabetes (if you're borderline that could be a factor), heavy alcohol use, some medications, etc.\u00a0\u00a0In severe liver conditions ALT is elevated into the 1000's... Of course, because yours is elevated, you'll want to keep an eye on it make sure it doesn't continue to rise, though yours has actually decreased.\u00a0\u00a0ALT is usually ordered with AST to determine liver function. Be sure to discuss all of this with your doctor.",

Here is an except...\"Reversing Diabetes: Can it Be Done in a Week?The study, entitled Reversal of type 2 diabetes: normalization of beta cell function in association with decrease pancreas and liver triglycerides, was exquisitely done. The bottom line: A dramatic diet change (protein shake, low glycemic load, plant-based low-calorie diet but no exercise) in diabetics reversed most features of diabetes within one week and all features by eight weeks. That\u2019s right, diabetes was reversed in one week. That\u2019s more powerful than any drug known to modern science.We know from gastric bypass patients that with rapid changes in diet right after surgery, within just a few days, without significant weight loss, diabetes goes away\u2014fatty livers heal, cholesterol levels plummet. Some theorized it was because of changes in the stomach hormones related to the gastric surgery. Others, including the researchers of this new study surmised that maybe it was just the drastic change in diet. So they went about studying just the diet change without surgery.They studied 11 people with diabetes and compared them to a control group. Through very sophisticated techniques including MRI imaging, they measured their blood sugar and insulin responses, cholesterol levels and fat in the pancreas and liver (some of the hallmarks of diabetes) before and after diet changes at 1, 4 and 8 weeks.What they found was revolutionary. The beta cells\u2014the pancreas\u2019 insulin producing cells\u2014woke up, and the fat deposits in the pancreas and liver went away. Blood sugars normalized in just one week, triglycerides dropped in half in one week and reduced 10-fold in eight weeks. The body\u2019s cells became more insulin sensitive and essentially, in just 8 weeks, all evidence of diabetes was gone and the diabetic patients looked just like the normal controls on all the testing.\"",

            "answer": "There isn't a lot to ask about Hashimoto's... they aren't going to do anything to treat that - they treat the resulting hypothyroidism with thyroid replacement hormones.Type I diabetes is an autoimmune disease and is not reversible.\u00a0\u00a0Type II diabetes can be reversed if one watches what they eat, exercise and lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0 While it's very possible to change your diet radically and go on a crash diet that might reverse diabetes in a week, it's highly unlikely that most people would stick with it long term.\u00a0\u00a0For most of us, diabetes would be back again in a couple months... trust me - my doctor had me on protein shakes, etc and it lasted about 3 weeks and I was done with it).You're much better off making changes that you can live with from now on, so once you lose the weight and reverse the diabetes, you can maintain it.\u00a0\u00a0Basically, a healthy diet that centers around low glycemic foods will help with weight loss and it will help keep blood sugar levels from spiking, which will keep insulin levels from spiking, as well.\u00a0\u00a0Low glycemic foods include most non starchy vegetables, whole grains, meat, dairy, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Limit fruit to one serving per day, because of the sugar content; avoid fruit juices, since they are pretty much empty calories. Opt for whole fruit so you get the fiber that will help slow down the absorption of the sugar in the fruit.\u00a0\u00a0Pair fruit with a protein, such as peanut butter or a whole grain, such as whole grain cracker to slow absorption.Exercise is not only good for helping to lose weight; it will also help get and keep blood pressure in control",
