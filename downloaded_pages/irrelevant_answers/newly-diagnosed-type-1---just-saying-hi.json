            "answer": "Actually, I've met with an amazing endocronolgist twice already.\u00a0\u00a0She's the head of Drexel's diabetes team for finding a cure for the disease. She is freakin amazing.\u00a0\u00a0She also hooked me up with an educator who decided to put me on the Lantus and the NovaLog.\u00a0\u00a0My next meeting with them will include a nutrionist. I asked about my diet and they told me they just want me to check my blood sugars before/after meals, when I wake up and before bed time.\u00a0\u00a0I'm assuming they want to know how I do with the specified amts. of insulin so they can eventually get me on a pump.Like I said, I've been very good with my shots before meals... but there may be once or twice a week where I won't give myself insulin before a meal.\u00a0\u00a0How big of a deal is this?\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks again!",

            "answer": "Hi WarrenI've been type 1 since 1969 and have been pumping since 1978 (just for background). I was 4 when I was dx'ed.If you enjoy eating and drinking high carb foods and drinks, it's very important you learn how these foods affect your BG and take appropriate insulin to cover them. I know many people who have never been taught how to carb count, but it really does allow and encourage you to lead as normal a life as possible while dealing with diabetes, whether you are pumping or using injections. I was fortunateenough to be taught this at a very early age and have subsequently done not too badly as far as complications and quality of life goes.There are a number of sites that can help you to calculate your insulin sensitivity, carb/insulin ratio and how much insulin is needed to bring your BG back under control when you go high, and I would be happy to dig them up for you if you wish.I think the best thing any diabetic can do is learn, learn, learn - and take charge of their own body. This is a VERY individualised condition, so knowing what works for YOU is of utmost importance. Best of luck!",

    "question": "Although I'm not a juvenile, I'm 26 years old and have recently been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I just stumbled upon this forum and think it's great.Since being diagnosed, I've been taking it pretty well.\u00a0\u00a0I inject 24-hour Lantus (basal) insulin once before bed.\u00a0\u00a0Before each meal, I inject with a NovoLog insulin pen, one unit for every 30g of carbs I'll be consuming.\u00a0\u00a0Since going with this routine for the past month now, my post-meal glucose levels have fallen from an avg. of 280+mg, to the 120-150mg range. I feel better, I have more energy, it's great.\u00a0\u00a0My question is this - I'm a normail 26 year old guy. I'm 5'7, 130lbs and like to EAT!!\u00a0\u00a0I eat a lot of ****, I'll confess. And drink lots of Pepsi and Mountain Dew. A usual meal for me consists of 75 - 150g of carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Since I'm being good with the NovoLog injections, should I really worry about the high amt. of carbs I'm consuming??Having diabetes has really opened my eyes to this disease, even though I should have been much more aware, considering my grandfather died of complications from Type 1 diabetes and currently my grandmother and aunt (same side of the family) have type 2.Again, I'm very happy this forum exists and thanks in advance for any help, tips or suggestions you can offer me!!",
