            "answer": "You did not tell us whether the company in India is sending you or if you are being hired by an American company while you are here. I ask because many American companies offer health insurance to their employees which would cover your medical expenses. This is something you may want to look into. As for any other kind of health insurance or travel insurance, I am not aware of any that would be available to you. I suggest that you contact the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundations Online Diabetes Support Team at www.jdrf.org/index.cfm?page_id=103451A window appears where you can give them some background information and ask your question. They will refer you to a staff member who handles international requests such as yours and this person may have much more information than I do about your options.",
