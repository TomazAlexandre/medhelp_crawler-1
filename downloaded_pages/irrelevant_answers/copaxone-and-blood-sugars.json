Unfortunately for me, sometimes I react strangely to meds because of the lupus and kidney desease. That's why I'm asking the quesiton. Copaxone actually empowers me, because I feel like the MS doesn't control me because I'm taking a proactive stand against it. So please, even if no one is having this problem, let me know. I have to figure out what's going on and get the sugars under control. I'd really prefer not to have to take more shots if at all possible.",

I skipped yesterday's shot, and blood sugars were down a bit all day. Then this a.m. my fasting was 109. Tomorrow I'm going to take my shot and see what happens. I am truly hoping it isn't the copaxone, just a blip I had to get over.The way one person reacts to a med is not necessarily how another person will react. The thing for me is that I watched my mother die from diabetes related condtions. So, diabetes scares me more than MS does.",

She was on it many years ago with no ill effects, but I hear they changed the manufacturing process and it now includes high fructose alcohol. Perhaps this increases the absorption rate or prevents rancidity? I am trying to figure out if a simple increase in insulin will counteract the general increase in BS, but perhaps it is a little more complicated. 800 is obviously EXTREMELY high, so there may be other factors involved. She had been throwing up off and on for the past week or so, but I am unsure if that was caused by constant high BS or if stress/sickness contributed to the high BS. Which came first? The chicken or the egg?",
