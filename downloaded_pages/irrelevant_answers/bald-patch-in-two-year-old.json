            "answer": "Carole:I appreciate your consternation, but there is little I can add.To my knowledge, there is no scalp condition in children with a particular association with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The most common cause of bald patches in children is alopeci areata, but that does not start as a \"blister.\"\u00a0\u00a0It sounds as though some inflammatory or infective process inflamed the scalp to the point of scarring the follicles.\u00a0\u00a0If so, a biopsy is unlikely to point to a treatable diagnosis.On the positive side, I can't think of any conditions which would require special attention on your part, diabetes-related or otherwise.In dermatology -- and elsewhere --\u00a0\u00a0may conditions have no specific explanations . . .Best.Dr. Rockoff",

            "answer": "Something in what you said struck a chord.\u00a0\u00a0I had forgotten to search the original manifetation of the problem.\u00a0\u00a0My serach yeilded something called Dermatitis herpatiformis.\u00a0\u00a0This disease starts out as blisters , but usuallly on the buttocks.\u00a0\u00a0It is associated with diabetes and gluten intolerance, which is also and autoimmune disease.\u00a0\u00a0 I will be taking the information that I have found in regards to this to her endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0She recently had an antibody test done along with her HgbA1C and had a slightly raised level.\u00a0\u00a0While this is indicative of some sort of celiac disease, the search is far from complete.\u00a0\u00a0If there is any information you can direct me towards for dermatitis herpatiformis that is in layman's terms, I would really like that.\u00a0\u00a0My current information contains a lot of tests, procedures and technical information that has me reading the medical dictionary almost as much as the articles themselves.\u00a0\u00a0Sincerest thanks,Carole",
