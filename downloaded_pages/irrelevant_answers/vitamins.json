            "answer": "Tom- Get off the cancer sticks as soon as possible. Hit the anti-oxidant vitamins very hard, especially vitamin C and bioflavinoids. 5 to 10 grams of vitamin c daily, while a high dose compared to all federal standards, will do much to strengthen the immune system, improve circulation, and promote wellness overall. You may need buffered C if you suffer any stomach or intestinal discomfort. If you can find a physician, probably a DO as opposed to an MD, who specializes in chelation, ask them about IV vitamin C therapy. It's usually administered over an hour or so in 50,000 milligram (50g) dose. This will really help circulation and give you a sense of elevated awareness. No negative health effects. Good luck.",

            "answer": "IV Vitamin C treatments are typically in the $75 range each, usually once a week for a while then tapering off to every month and eventually a few times a year. Bioflavinoids act as an anti-oxidant preventing vitamins and adrenalin from being oxidized by copper-containing enzymes. Bioflavinoids are sometimes refered to as Vitamin P. The human body can not produce it's own supply of bioflavinoids so it must be supplied by the diet. Bioflavinoids are important in reducing pain and symptoms associated with bleeding. They also act as anatureal anti-bacterial, promoting circulation, stimulate bile and lower cholesterolUsesIncreases effectiveness of vitamin CPrevents hemorrhoidsPrevents miscarriagesPrevents retinal bleeding in people with diabetes and hypertensionPrevents capillary fragilityPrevents nosebleedPrevents post-partum hemorrhagePrevents menstrual disordersPrevents blood clotting and plattelet clumpingPrevents easy bruisingPrevents cataractsReduces symptoms of herpes.Zyban is also sold as a psychiatric med called welbutrin.
