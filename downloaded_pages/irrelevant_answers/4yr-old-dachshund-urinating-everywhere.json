Maybe even a threat she sees outside so she marks as soon as she comes in.\u00a0\u00a0Just a thought.Without you writing a book of everything going on in the house, your life, the dog's life, etc.\u00a0\u00a0it's hard to say what it is exactly.I would say though, a trip to the vet is a good idea.Best of luck to you!",
