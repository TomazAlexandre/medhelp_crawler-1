            "answer": "Hello Mr,The calf discomfort is caused by night cramping. Muscle cramping is usually casued by a lack of magnesium. This could also be the pain you are experiencing in your feet and toes BUT because you have diabetes you really should get this assessed by your physician, especially the problem with your feet. In the meantime I would purchase some magnesium tablets from the health store. You can take as many as you wish as magnesium is a mineral (not a vitamin) and your body will eradicate any left over not used by your body - so it won't build up! As far as the shortness of breath goes, this is casued from your diabetes. Lack of oxygen to your body cells causes the shortness of breathe and resulting fatigue you would be feeling. Passive exercise, physiotherapy to teach you to breathe deeply should help with this. But again, I stress the point of visiting your doctor for a full examination. You never know, your diaabetes could have progressed OR there might be some other medication to help you. I hope this helps. Take care, Trishy",
