            "answer": "Well, if you're saying the opthalmologist couldn't determine that weak eye muscles were the cause of your double vision, I wonder what he did say you should do about your double vision, surely he didn't leave you hanging.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes double vision is caused by medications, so review side effects of whatever you're taking.\u00a0\u00a0Also, you could get a second opinion from another eye specialist before you seek out a neurologist, before you spend a lot of money with neuro tests.\u00a0\u00a0There are other reasons for double vision, but I'm no expert in eyes, so if you seek a second opinion from another opthalmologist, you could ask him to point you in the right direction for treatment.",

He is stuck on the idea that the only reason for weak eye muscles is high blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I am not completely ignorant on causes of weak muscles and the fact that it comes and goes is also worrisome.\u00a0\u00a0So, hopefully the referral will get me some results.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your comments.",
