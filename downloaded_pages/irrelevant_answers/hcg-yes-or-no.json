            "answer": "The more I learn about the HCG diet, the more I'm opposed to it.My advice would be to take a long-term approach to being healthy, instead of aiming for rapid weight loss.It sounds like you're retaining a lot of water, which is what's causing the rabid weight gain. That means something isn't working right in your body.\u00a0\u00a0An HCG diet could be dangerous, possibly even deadly, for someone who may be suffering from a thyroid disorder, kidney problems, diabetes, or a heart condition.Talk to your doctor first.The best way to lose weight is the least exciting, which is why so many people tend to ignore it for the more glamorous, quick-fix diets.Try this:Find out how many calories you need to eat to maintain your current body weight, then cut 500 calories off of that each day to lose 1 lbs a week. You can find calculators out there just by Googling \"Calculate Calorie Maintenance.\"This is the safest, easiest way to lose weight. Then, as you go, add exercise, which doesn't HAVE to be something crazy. Walking is one of the best forms of exercise out there. It's also pretty cheap and not as flashy, but it works.I imagine you could lose most of the weight you needed using this method, and it doesn't cost a penny.",

    "question": "I've used HCG before and I want to go back on it. I had no health issues with HCG injections. I am now over weight AGAIN and have a lot less energy then 15 years ago so my activity level is not the same. I've had surgery on my back and feel great but still the energy level is the pits. I need to loose 35-40 lbs and it's not coming off. I can weigh 157 today and get up tomorrow at 165. What can I do? What are my options? Does anyone know of a clinic in Fort Oglethorp, GA or Chattanooga, TN that has HCG injections?",
