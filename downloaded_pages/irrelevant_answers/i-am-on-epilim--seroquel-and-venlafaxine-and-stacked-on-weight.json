            "answer": "Yes I gained a fair amount of weight on Depakoate (another brand name for Epilim) and Seroquel. I do know I had less of a problem with weight gain with Lamictal and that among the current generation of antipsychotics, Abilify, Fanapt and Saphris are the least likely to cause weight gain but each person responds differently to each medication. Ask your psychiatrist about available options.",

            "answer": "Weight gain is a problem with some of the medications along with dramatic weight loss. When I was on a Seroquel for a period of time I gained some weight, but not alot, just because I was not using it for its intended purpose but as a sleeping medication.However, it did not work for me and I proved to be leaving it quickly because of it's interactions with other drugs at the time.There are other drugs available that can help BUT each drug affects every person differently; I suggest you talk to your Psychiatrist about all your concerns and hopefully something can be worked out.- Good Luck",

            "answer": "Seroquel is often asociated with weight gain, to the point that it can precipitate Diabetes 2.\u00a0\u00a0Your prescribing psychiatrist should be aware of the warnings associated with this drug, and should be monitoring your weight. I s/he is not paying attention to you as a whole person, rather than just your psychiatric issues, be sure to call it to her/his attention (and maybe consider whether this is the right doctor for you?).If your immense weight gain is still ignored, bring it to the attention of your primary care physician, because it puts you at greater risk for a number of medical problems.Best wishes...",
