            "answer": "Sorry posted to the wrong thing... Useless new phone. Haha however i am a type one diabetic at week 7 of pregnancy also with a surprise baby on the way. I had not planned it and was not having great blood glucose beforehand. I have an appointment with a high risk pregnancy team in the following weeks so i can update on any useful info. I have friends who are diabetic mums and were induced between 36-38 weeks so take a month of your due date to be ready for baby as they do like diabetics in earlier for it. All of my friends tell me not to worry about yo-yoing blood glucose as it happens with the hormones and changes of your body.. Just test 10 times a day and adjust insulin when you notice it creeping up. I have about 6 girlfriends who are diabetic mums and they say the worst thing you can do is beat yourself up over sugars... Just correct and move on ... Be as healthy as you can and as mobile as possible. I will update if I learn anything helpful at my first high risk appointment :) good luck and congratulations!!",
