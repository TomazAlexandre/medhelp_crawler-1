    "question": "What now? It's always something wrong with me. I stopped even going to the upid doctors. Then I was in a wreck 9/26/08. My \"issues\" I've had for 2 years (rheumy dxed RA 3/24/09) are 10 times worse. I can deal with most of them. Now it's something else. I get the \"slapped face\" (aka:SF) when I have ocular migraines. Which ever eye is effected, that side of my face is ultra sensitive. Like cold is freezing & hot is like fire. Almost a sunburned feeling with no change is skin color or texture.Well I've gotten this feeling other places on my body for very short periods of time. In June or July I had some kind of infection in my right ear & glands. That side of my face, ear & neck were like SF. Oh, I call it this because the 1st time it happened I swore my hubby had slapped me while we were sleeping. Any how, it didn't bother me too much. The migraines on the other hand make me feel like I'm dying. I had my 1st true \"come to Jesus\" moment during the worst migraine I'd ever had in my life.Well SF took over the top of my thighs & upper arms about a month ago & lasted I guess a week. Well it came back with a vengeance 2 weeks ago left for 4 days & is back again. I am in so much pain right now. No one can get even close to me without me grimacing. My skin feels bruised, sun burnt, hot, swollen but it looks perfectly normal. I actually felt it come on around 7pm last night. My hands feet & face are swollen too. Not my joints but my tissues. I'm kinda itchy too. Can't rub my skin at all. I feel like 1 huge bruise. My upper arms, all parts of my legs, my shoulders & back. My boobs (sorry if TMI) started to hurt so bad the 1st time it took me over & now too. I figured it was something hormonal at 1st. Then I realized it was SF taking over my body. Even my pant legs touching my calves hurt. Even a light breeze hurts or taking a shower. I have to take rx sleeping pills to be comfortable enough to sleep.When will this madness end? I am so freakin sick of getting new symptoms upon new symptoms. Sorry about the whine. I just really needed to get it out. I've tried reaching out on other boards & forums. I'm hoping someone will read this & \"feel\" my pain & tell me what it is. Is it a symptom of RA? If so, what can they do about it? I am nearly miserable. I try to tell my hubby & friends but they just don't get it. I so wish I could give everyone I know this pain for 1 hour. They probably still wouldn't understand. Thanks for reading such a long post! My mood is wonderful but this is bringing me down. I've got to get a grip. Take care!Jen",
