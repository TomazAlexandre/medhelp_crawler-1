            "answer": "Dear Crambone,From what you describe I don't think you have a thyroid problem.\u00a0\u00a0I do think that you have a lot of anxiety around your health, when all apparently has been tested as being fine.The problem when we are anxious about our health is that we begin to notice every sensation and analyse it in depth.\u00a0\u00a0However the comprehensive testing you've had would appear to have ruled out anything major.\u00a0\u00a0And you are spending a lot of money you could otherwise be enjoying.I think your focus now should be on the basics such as exercise (if you aren't already 30 - 60 minutes of exercise a day should help a lot), diet (high in fruits, vegetables and healthy carbs and lean proteins), stay active and interested in life.\u00a0\u00a0Meditation or tai chi or yoga could also be very beneficial, I believe.Very best wishes to you.",

            "answer": "Hi,Actually, from what you describe, many of your symptoms DO sound like they can be thyroid....autoimmune thyroid, especially Graves.\u00a0\u00a0Although, I'd find it hard to believe that your Dr. didn't test you for this since he/she tested so many other things.My best advice to you would be to talk to your doctor and find out what he/she has tested for.\u00a0\u00a0Communicate with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0You pay for those appointments, so make the best of them.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't trust your Dr., find another.Good luck!",
