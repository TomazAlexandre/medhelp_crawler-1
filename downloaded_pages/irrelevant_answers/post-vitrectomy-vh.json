    "question": "Hello,I had a small chronic peripheral retinal detachment due to lattice 10 months ago which was corrected with a segmental buckle. 4 months after the initial surgery I started having vitreous hemorrhages (I had 4 or 5 of them) which usually resolved in about 2-3 weeks.Quite dense. My overall health is good (no diabetes etc) and retina is attached. Fluorescence angiography showed dye leakage which was attributed to avulsed vessel (s) and OCT showed an ERM.I decided to have a vitrectomy after getting the opinion of 2 retina specialists to release traction.That was 8 days ago.\u00a0\u00a0Endolaser photocoagulation was applied and SF6 gas was used.My concerns:1. I\u2019m in face down position. Gas bubble is diminished but the vision outside of it is non \u2013 existent (light perception, I can tell my hand is moving but that's all). It looks like very very thick fog. Red-yellowish. Every time I put drops in, I can see a strand or two of blood released in the vitreous cavity. Very similar to the blood released in previous hemorrhages. I believe I keep bleeding - is this something that is expected to happen?2. Retina specialist didn\u2019t peel the ERM, he said he didn\u2019t want to operate on the macula at this point. Any ideas?",
