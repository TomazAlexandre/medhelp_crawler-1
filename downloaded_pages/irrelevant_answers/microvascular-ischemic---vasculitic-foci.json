            "answer": "Hi and welcome,Your question has landed in the MS community which you may not have intended, in regards to MS what you have mentioned isn't generally suggestive of a neurological condition like MS.It's unusual for a neurologist or any specialists to be honest, to be stating alarmist commentary \"see a large but not too large part of your brain tissue is dead and there are multiple white foci\" and send you out the door without a medical explanation and plan of action. From my understanding your MRI results wouldn't be inconsistent with your diagnosis of migraines or hypertension, so i truly don't understand where that is coming from.It's a bit extremist thinking to be assuming a few micro vascular lesions, is dead brain tissue and or evidence of a imminent life threatening medical condition and then just refer you on to see a cardiologist, did your neurologist by any chance mention ischemic transient attacks?Your blood pressure is on the high side, possibly indicating related hypertensive condition, your also pre-diabetic and suffered with migraines for years, so heart and vascular conditions would definitely need to be investigated for potential causation.You've now seen a cardiologist and your cardiologist is saying your heart is all normal, no vasculitis damaging your heart which is great to rule out.....I actually think your doctors will probably be considering the potential that this may all come back to your pre-diabetes state and the strong association there is with microvascular disease preceding clinical onset of type 2 diabetes, which has serious long term implications to your health.Information on pre-diabetes and vascular disease:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3366458/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877593409000563http://www.diabetes.co.uk/body/vascular-system.htmlI hope that helps give you some focus and direction!Good luck........JJ",

            "answer": "Hi E -As JJ mentioned, what you describe does not sound like MS. All of your test results, and doctor opinions, suggest that your symtoms are caused by circulation issues.We are n ot doctors, just folks with MS, or are in the MS diagnostic process. MS is a neurological disease. We do not know about blood flow problems.Kyle",

            "answer": "Hi there,You maybe experiencing a little confusion or misunderstanding, there are no blood tests for MS, the blood tests you've had will be to look for other medical conditions but it would not of been specifically testing your blood for MS, because there isn't any.You said....\"my first MRI the radiologist have mentioned that it may be sign of delimenting white matter disease mostly MS,\u00a0\u00a0was suspected , to rule out in detail the radiologist mentioned further evaluation required\"....this would most likely be what you are paraphrasing from what you've read off your MRI report, but this is just what's commonly written in the general differentials for some one of your age group, and not as diagnostically significant as you are probably assuming.Due to your age demyelinating conditions also need to be considered by your neurologist, but from everything you have written, your doctors are focused on vascular related medical conditions because it would 'most likely' explain the totality of your medical evidence, medical history, symptoms etcI understand how worried you are but you need keep in mind that your MRI report stated \"Multiple foci of T2w/ Flair hyperintensity in subcortical while matter of bilateral frontal and parietal lobes, likey microvascular ischemic / vasculitic foci\" and your medical history of Migraines, pre-diabetes and high range blood pressure are the common explanations for the \"microvascular ischemic\" white matter changes identified on your MRI.Many medical conditions also cause some of the same or very similar 'symptoms' that are commonly associated with MS, the conditions you have a history of definitely do cause some very similar symptoms and if you search information on those medical conditions you will see this and it will most likely aid you in working out the direction you probably need to be taking.Hope that helps clear up any misunderstandings you may be having...Cheers...........JJ",
