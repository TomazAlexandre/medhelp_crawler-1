            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.The possibility of carpal tunnel syndrome cannot be ruled out since your neck X rays have been unremarkable.Also it is important to rule out neuropathy due to diabetes and B12 deficiency.If Carpal tunnel syndrome is confirmed then you may have to undergo surgery to relieve the symptoms.Please consult an experienced neurologist.",

            "answer": "I have seen two neurologists. One on my own, who said that the carpel tunnel wasn't progressed enough to do surgery, the other one was through my workers comp doctor. He said there was nothing wrong with me, other then some sensory damage. As he was saying this, I got a pain spasm from my shoulder, down to my finger tips, goosebumps all over the area. And he said, according to my tests, that shouldn't be happening. But I couldn't fake the goosebumps, so he didn't know what was wrong with me. I walked out of my last wc appointment when the doctor basically told me to suck it up and am now seeing my gp on my own. He has referred me to a shoulder specialists and I go in Feb. it's very frustrating for me because my arm hurts all the time and no one seems to know how to fix it.",

    "question": "A few years ago, the\u00a0\u00a0pinky on right hand went numb. I've had 4 EMG's and an MRI, c spine x ray since then. All the EMG's are different. Two say I have carpel tunnel with slight deviations on the mildness of it, one says I have a severely pinched Ulnar nerve and the last one says there's nothing wrong. the MRI and the c spine x ray were normal. I still have pain, increasing as I use my right arm more. My pinky is still numb and now the tips of all my fingers are numb, I have a pain in my wrist that follows my thumb line upward and sometimes it goes to all of my fingers, sometimes it stays in the thumb and it feels like it does when you stick your tongue to a battery. that little zzz you get. Also, my neck and shoulder, down by the shoulder blade, ache like a rottening tooth!!\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I'm at my wits end here, I hurt alllllllllll the time and the workers comp doctor just told me to suck it up and keep doing my stretches and continue strength training at home. could some please give me some advice??",
