            "answer": "Hi Debbie,Yes it is possible to have autoimmune hep with a negative biopsy. When they do a biopsy they take such a small segment of the liver and maybe the liver in the area of the biopsy was not affected.\u00a0\u00a0I have autoimmune hep and all the things that go with it.I also have Hashimoto's Thyroid disease.\u00a0\u00a0With High SGOT/ALT they will keep testing.a positive ANA you definately have autoimmune diseases.\u00a0\u00a0Let me know what furtherthings they have done for you and how you are doing.ihbs",

I was first told Hisho and now told Hypo.\u00a0\u00a0My ANA and other results are close to yours.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have a lot of issues with handling heat, the sun and fatigue?\u00a0\u00a0I melt in the sun, once Fall and Winter kick in, I get a lot of relief, but still can not have very warm shower or many layers of clothes.",

            "answer": "Hi,After about 1 year of going to several especialists I've got not one but quite a few diagnosis including Autoimmune Hepatitis. I am currently seeing Dr. Morelli at Shands for the Autoimmune Hepatitis and I am on treatment now for about 8 months... this past January I had my 6 months check-up and I liver enzimes started to climb up again so the doctor double the dose of the Imuran and so far it loos like that the disease is under control. I was tested positive for several other autoimmune diseases (Hashimoto, MCTD overlaping SLE, Autoimmune Hepatitis, Type 1 Diabetes, Lynchen S. , positive for Sjogrens and possible Raynaulds Syndrome). In consequence of the autoimmune diseases I developed a heart condition and few other things that make the list quite extensive ... so far I am managing, having some good and some very bad days but I have 2 good reasons to keep moving forward and do let the diseases to keep me from living a fulfilling life :)",

            "answer": "Hey!!Yes, I can trully related your issues with sun and heat. The best time of the year for me are fall and winter... I cannot be directly exposed to the sun without having consequences and also because of all the medications that I am currently taking. My worse flare ups happen in the Summer time. Some days I am so tired that I can't get up and my body ams muscles ache so much that I can't do simple things like comb my hair...As I understand Hashimoto's disease is a disease, and hypothyroidism is a condition. Hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by Hashimoto's disease, but the two terms are not interchangeable.In Hashimoto's, antibodies react against proteins in the thyroid gland, causing gradual destruction of the gland itself, and making the gland unable to produce the thyroid hormones the body needs. Many people with Hashimoto's disease end up hypothyroid, the situation where the thyroid is either underactive or, eventually, totally unable to function. Keep in touch!!",

    "question": "Hello,I am a 39 years old female. I was diagnosed 5 months ago with Type 1 Diabetes and Hashimoto's Disease. I was also checked positive for\u00a0\u00a0SLE and Sjogrens.For the past 12 months my liver enzimes are elevated (not to much, about 2 or max 3 times normal limits). I have a ANA positive (titer 1:160), ASMA Positive, I had a Liver Biposy done and the results came back as \"rare isolated focus of non-caseating granuloma and rare focus of chronic inflammation of lobule with minimal chronic inflammation of portal triads, no accumulation of iron or fibrosis\".\u00a0\u00a0My doctor was not able to give me a final diagnosis yet. As I understand my liver biopsy doesn't show that I have AIH so my question is : Is it possible to have ANA positive, ASMA positive, elevated liver enzimes, joint pain, nausea, liver biopsy negative and still don't have AIH?? In this case why do I have ANA and ASMA positive?? Are they signs of something else besides AIH?? Can someone give me some ideas, please??? I want to make an educated decision when I talk to my doctor again, especially taking in consideration the fact that the treatment for AIH will be very hard on my body, as being Diabetic. Thanks for your time!!!",
