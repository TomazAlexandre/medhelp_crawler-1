            "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your continued discomfort after your procedure.\u00a0\u00a0You seem to have a lot of residual questions after your procedure.\u00a0\u00a0I would encourage you to schedule an appointment with your cardiologist to voice all these concerns.\u00a0\u00a0I will attempt to answer your questions in order below:1.\u00a0\u00a0As people age, cholesterol plaques build up in the arteries of the body.\u00a0\u00a0We most commonly hear about them in the coronary arteries (in the heart) because these are the plaques that can rupture and lead to massive heart attacks.\u00a0\u00a0Plaque does build up in other arteries as well, but they are often large enough to tolerate it.\u00a0\u00a0It is not uncommon for people to have a large plaque burden without symptoms if this build-up happens slowly over time.2.\u00a0\u00a0It is a bit unusual to have residual pain in your groin over a month after your procedure.\u00a0\u00a0Some causes could include development of scar tissue, nerve irritation, artery dissection, hematoma (blood collection).\u00a0\u00a0The dissection and hematoma should be recognized by your cardiologist as they may require treatment, especially if you get worsening pain when you walk that is relieved by rest in that leg.\u00a0\u00a0The scar or nerve irritation should resolve with time.3.\u00a0\u00a0Diet is critical in patients with atherosclerosis.\u00a0\u00a0Low animal fat, low cholesterol diets help prevent further plaque formation.4.\u00a0\u00a0While you may not have hypertension now, you may develop it.\u00a0\u00a0Salt worsens blood pressure, and high blood pressure causes worsening hardening of the arteries.5.\u00a0\u00a0Fiber is good for regulating appetite, bowels, and blood sugar control.\u00a0\u00a0Fiber can also help lower your cholesterol.6.\u00a0\u00a0Angioplasty itself does not decrease life expectancy, but the risk factors and diseases that lead to angioplasty (hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity) can all decrease life expectancy.\u00a0\u00a0A stent can close up over time, but often times they stay open for an indefinite amount of time.I hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck.",

            "answer": "Thanx for your prompt reply1. does the chances of hypertension or diabetes increases after angioplasty? a normal person is also prone to these then why so much emphasis on diet control after angioplasty?2. I have been prescribed medicines to lower cholesterol, control Blood Pressure, to thin the blood. and I have been asked to take the medicine regularly for life time. in that case what is the importance of diet control? can I not take the normal diet which i used to take before angioplasty?3. There are many herbal treatment to lower cholesterol, will they help if I start taking them along with my medicines",

            "answer": "1.\u00a0\u00a0Angioplasty does not increase your chance of hypertension or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0However, the risk factors that led up to the situation which required you to undergo angioplasty can be made worse of your diet is not optimal.\u00a0\u00a0Thus, trying to prevent worsening of your underlying disease with improved diet is very important.2.\u00a0\u00a0Take all of your medications as prescribed by your physician.\u00a0\u00a0These help IN ADDITION to diet.\u00a0\u00a0Both are very important.3.\u00a0\u00a0Herbal medications are not regulated by the FDA and can often interfere with medications you are taking.\u00a0\u00a0Some are probably helpful, others are worthless, and some are actually harmful.\u00a0\u00a0Discuss with your cardiologist before starting any new herbal medications.Again you clearly have a lot of questions about your condition which have not been answered.\u00a0\u00a0I would strongly encourage you to discuss these issues with your doctor who knows your condition in detail.Best of luck.",
