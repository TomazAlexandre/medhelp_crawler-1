            "answer": "BP of 43? Anything below 90/60mm is bad. If he is experiencing dizziness, fatigue, or nausea it could be a sign of serious underlying conditions such as a heart condition, blood infection or damage to the nervous system [flickering eyes].You kept it a secret as to what country you reside in. This is important to know as the two most common glucose test results are identified as mg/dl [American] and mmol/l [European] and differ in meaning from each other. As such, we cannot tell if the glucose level of 16 was prandial [before a meal] or postprandia] [after a meal] so I'll present both sides as prandial.Glucose of 16 mg/dl: This is dangerously low as it could put your husband into coma.Glucose of 16 mmol/l: This is getting high and could put your husband into cardiac arrest if left untreated.As you can see the mg/dl number is life threatening where the mmol/l is considered out of control glucose management - his medication needs adjustment. In either case your husband needs to see a doctor ASAP for an thorough evaluation.",
