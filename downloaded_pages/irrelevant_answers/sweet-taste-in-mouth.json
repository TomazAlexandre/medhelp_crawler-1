    "question": "Ok so for some reason I always have a sweet taste in the past few days. Like if i suck on my saliva a bit it taste sweet a little bit, but its hardly noticeable. I dont have sore throat or any sores in my mouth and Im wondering its this is a neurological problem. My diet hasnt really changed\u00a0\u00a0and is pretty consistent. I think it might be my saliva. Is there a problem with my pancreas or should I not be worried?",
