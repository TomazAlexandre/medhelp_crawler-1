            "answer": "Hi there,Hope you are doing well. A physical examination and tests are must for correct diagnosis and management of your condition. A family history of aneurysm, smoking, diabetes, hypertension are few risk factors of this condition. Aneurysms are usually asymptomatic but there may be pain and throbbing in few cases which can indicate that it is likely to rupture. Tests like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/computerized tomography may be helpful. Consult a physician and get evaluated.Best wishes and regards!",

            "answer": "Hello and thank you for your comments Arti.\u00a0\u00a0It seems as if it's intestinal related.\u00a0\u00a0Can the intestine pulsate like this?\u00a0\u00a0The pulsing is rhythmic, however it is NOT in sync with my heart rate...different rate entirely.\u00a0\u00a0There is never pain either.\u00a0\u00a0Most of the time this symptom is not present, but every once in a while there will be 2-5 days (or a little more) where throughout the day it will pulsate for several minutes at a time.I have no family history of aneurysms, I don't smoke and I am not diabetic.",

    "question": "It's happend before and it's happening again this week, on and off.\u00a0\u00a0 This totally bizarre pulsating sensation (very noticeable but NEVER painful) around the scar from my appendectomy (which was many years ago).\u00a0\u00a0That is, just south and to the right of the navel.\u00a0\u00a0It's VERY rhythmical too, like a steady 75 bpm.\u00a0\u00a0But it is NOT in sync with my HR so I doubt it's AAA (abdominal aortic aneurysm).It can beat uncontrollably and steadily for 10 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0Typically it will go for a few minutes, then stop for a bit, then start back up.\u00a0\u00a0Usually after 2-4 days it disappears til the next time, which could be months.\u00a0\u00a0Currently I've had this since early Sunday morning.Nothing else too out of the ordinary this week with symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I feel fine.\u00a0\u00a0But this pulsing is super annoying and rather uncomfortable (without being painful, if that makes sense).Any ideas wtf this is???\u00a0\u00a0I figure it's my colon/large intestine but I really don't know.\u00a0\u00a0And if it is the colon what is making it pulse/jack-hammer like that?Oh and when it's happening you can actually look at the skin around that area and see it pop up and down, up and down.\u00a0\u00a0It's freaky!!!\u00a0\u00a0I hate it.\u00a0\u00a0But again, zero pain.",
