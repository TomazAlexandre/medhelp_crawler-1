            "answer": "I would just switch doctors now. I know that you are close to the 3rd trimester but I switched doctors at about 18 weeks because I moved and it hasn't caused any problems. You can get ALL your information sent over from the other doctors office and just move on. I would NEVER want to stay with a doctor that was rude and made me feel bad about myself especially during such an intimate and blessed moment in my life.. He's also an idiot for saying that! Gaining 9 lbs in one month isn't even that big of a deal since one month you might gain 1 lb and the next 10 lbs and the next 1 lb. It just depends on how the baby is growing. Ugh what I JERK! I'm mad for you! Also, your husband is not going to leave you for gaining weight! He loves you and he loves your baby and he knows that you are doing this for the both of you! If anything when you have that baby he will just love you more. Also, I'm not sure if you are planning to breastfeed but after you have the baby its a really good way to loose weight fast. ***HUGS*** I am so sorry that A*S*Shole of a doctor got you down. Screw him.",

            "answer": "not necessarily because my dad was only 105 lbs when he was diagnosed with borderline diabetes and high blood pressure can be cause by numerous things... but the way your doctor treated you is wrong and unacceptable and would think about changing doctors... and if your husband left you because you gained weight then he is not worth your time i know that when i was pregnant i was very self conscience about my weight but it is good to gain about 25lbs during your pregnancy and yes if you gain more it will be harder to lose your weight but not impossible",

            "answer": "It's never too late to switch dr's, if you don't like your dr then you won't enjoy the birth and afterbirth nearly as much.\u00a0\u00a0Ganing weight during pregnancy is normal.\u00a0\u00a0They typically say to gain 15-30 lb depending on how much you weighed before you were pregnant, although from people I've talked to they almost never stick to that.\u00a0\u00a0With my first pregnancy I was slightly overweight and gained 40 lb and didn't loose any of it until my son was at least a year.And I TOTALLY agree with alaysha, she's 100% correct about how some months you'll gain a lot and others not so much.Get a new dr, and if you and/or your husband are even remotely concerned about weight gain keep a food journal.",

            "answer": "My medical doctor doesn't even refer his patients to an ob until around 30 weeks..Its not too late. I only have an OB because I was seeing her beforehand to help me get pregnant, and I don't like my medical doctor so I ended up calling her during the first trimester when my m/s suddenly disappeared. My doc was p****d, which made me even more glad I took matters into my own hands.I too got in trouble this month for gaining 8 pounds, and I'm about 25 weeks as well. She didn't belittle me though, she just went over my eating habits with me and banned me from drinking fruit juice, because she figures thats the reason I've gained so much.",

    "question": "Hi Ladies,I am 25 weeks and as of yesterday I can't stand my doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Ok at this months appointment my doctor told me I gained 9lbs in a month.\u00a0\u00a0Well altogether I have gained 15lbs.\u00a0\u00a0He was soooo rude to me.\u00a0\u00a0He told me that if I keep going at this rate I will be almost 300lbs and it will stay on me for two years.\u00a0\u00a0Then he proceeds to say that if I am eating unhealthy then my child will eat unhealthy.\u00a0\u00a0He keeps telling me that he wants me to loose weight instead of gain.\u00a0\u00a0Not to mention he said all this in front of my husband!\u00a0\u00a0I was sooo upset because all I could think about is my husband leaving me because I gained weight.\u00a0\u00a0Well I called back to the office and I told her he was unprofessional and hurt my feelings.\u00a0\u00a0She said that there are patients that think he is very offensive.\u00a0\u00a0She said that he is a stickler about weight and he doesn't want me to have diabetes or High Blood Pressure.\u00a0\u00a0FYI-My pressure is good (119/70).\u00a0\u00a0And I think you have got to gain a considerable amount of weight in order to be diagnosed diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0All I know is when I have my baby and go back for my 6 week check up I am through with him.\u00a0\u00a0HE *****!",
