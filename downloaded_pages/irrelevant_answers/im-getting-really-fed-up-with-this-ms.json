            "answer": "I'm 99.9% sure it is not an infection going on for the chills and fatigue.I have spent most of this afternoon thinking about this and have come up with two possible culprits.1) My PC just increased my thyroid dosage so my body might be trying to adjust to this. I think I remember tyroid can mess with your temperature perception.2) My Shrink had RX me with an anti anxiety medication that I had just started taking a recently. Sure didn't help with the anxiety for the heart issues. But I stopped taking it 2 days ago because I was getting light headed and dizzy especially when I stood up. So I expect it was making my BP too low and I didn't think to check my BP at the time. But I'm not about to take it again just to check my BP. So the fatigue could be from going off of that medicine.My look on the bright side for tonight is:I lost 10 Lb over the last 3 months. Haven't been able to even keep my weight constant let alone lose weight for years.My PC nurse called yesterday to let me know my A1C was down to 6.5 and I officially don't have to take the diabetes medicine any more. I am controlling it by diet alone.Dennis",

            "answer": "You're already going to be sorry I'm back:-) I think you need to call and get some advice concerning your meds.Is your \"shrink' aware that you stopped taking your meds? And of the side effects? He does need to know these things to give you the best care.When you started your CellCept, did they give you a sheet of paper listing side effects and when to call them with health issues? If they did, scrounge around and see if you can find it. If you saw the top of my desk, it would be an impossibility at this point.Let us know what they tell after you call tomorrow. Okay?Ren",

            "answer": "My next appointment with my shrink is in 2 weeks so I was just going to let him know then about stopping the medication. I'm not sure what the shrink could do to replace this as he already picked the one that he could get the lowest dosage with.When I checked for drug interactions for the med the shrink RX for me it came up that it could cause an additive effect for 2 of my blood pressure medicines. That is the main reason I went with low blood pressure due to the symptoms I was experiencing while taking it. I waited in starting to take this medicine until after I checked with my PC due to that warning. She felt it would be safe since I'm on such low dosages of the medications. But it looks like as usual I'm just too sensitive to medications. It is because of this sensitivity to medication that I'm on 3 different BP medications.I have been taking CellCept for over a year now I think. So side effects are not an issue with it I would think. As for warnings it was just that I should look out for infections ( no real info on how to tell this or not) and to stay away from sick people.Even with my thyroid medicine I'm on a very low dosage. The increase was only 0.0065mcg per day. You would think that such a small increase would have any effect on me. My PC wanted to try this dosage to see if she could get my reading better as they have been consistently low for a long time.And as I said I was officially given the OK to not take my diabetes medicine. When I was first DX with diabetes a few months ago my PC RX me with glipizide but told me to try diet and if my glucose didn't come down to take it. When I first started taking my Glucose I was getting reading over 200 but once I changed my diet they were consistently below 140. So once my PC got my A1C results she decided I didn't need the glipizide to control it.Dennis",

    "question": "This is really a vent against MS in general... as my symptoms have been really in the pits and are driving me crazy.I don't mind the foot drop.. I can live with that.\u00a0\u00a0The pain, electric shocks, dropping things...While irritating I can still live with them...In fact I am getting so that I can even ignore them most of the time. Of course it is kind of hard to ignore it when I drop a hot cup of coffee in my lap. :) At least I still have my humor...But I am still having those heart attack symptoms which are MS related as it has me almost constantly in a state of anxiety. I keep telling myself to calm down, but how..... I've talked to my PC about this and all she said was that I would have to learn to listen to my body to tell the difference between this MS stuff and a real heart attack.And now to top things off My fatigue is going to town. The last few days I have needed to take naps and just figured maybe I didn't sleep too good. But yesterday I needed to take a nap 3 times and the last nap actually ended up being for 11 hours as I didn't wake up with my alarm. So this morning after that 11 hour nap within 1 hour I couldn't keep my eyes open and had to nap for another hour.I've also been getting chills for the last few days ( Maybe a week) and I take my temp and it is my normal 96.8 and my house is at 72. So there is no reason for the chills. One more thing I have to worry about is infections due to being on CellCept of my MS. So it tends to freak me out a little bit when I get the chills as that could indicate I am running a fever.Me thinks that maybe I am having a flare?Thanks for listening.Dennis",
