            "answer": "Hi,You are quite young to have thesee problems but it is not impossible to have problems at your age.First questions are did you have recent trauma to the penis that you might have neglected? Be it an injury or possible be the effect of sexual play or so called toys. Just my own experience while I was a child ending up with a numb penis and problems urinating took place after I place an o-ring on the base of my penis. To me it gave a sensation of having a more extensive erection at the time and I was stupid enough to leave it in place for several days only taking it off during bath time. It took a good warning from our doctor and my parents and several weeks of numbness for me not to try it again.At about the age of 30 I ended up with difficulty and frequency of urination which after an extensive infestigation was found out to be a neurogenic bladder. Several years later I was also diagnosed with a neurological condition that results in numbness and loss of function of areas where pressure is applied to exposed nerves. I first noticed it in my hands and fingers.If it is not the result of sexual play or possible injury than there are several different possibilities for it and you will need to consult with a urologist to infestigate the problem.A couple of things that come to mind would be possible diabetes or MS. This is just my guess as I have no medical knowledge. I'm just sharing what I have experienced as well as what I had done unintentionally as a child. I did not know of the harm that it could do at the time.Diagnosing problems sooner than later is allways best and at times you must advocate for yourself to get the help that you need.Now at 47, I'm impotent and have neumerous health problems. From 2003 to 2008 I was able to enjoy a near normal sexlife after having received care from a truly concerened urologist. I had mentioned problems with ED prior to it, but after intervention did not benefit me I did not persue it any farther at the time. The uorlogist who treated me in 2003 was oart of a rehabilitation program and was part of sexual health. The injections of testosterone and California Trimix that he described to inject into my my penis made a huge difference, and I'm very thankfult for the treatment and care that he provided.I sincerely hope that you will get diagnoised and that they are able to reverse your problems.God Bless,Ron.",

            "answer": "Hello,Numbing sensation of the penis can be due to anxiety,contact dermatitis,traumatic damage to the nerves of penis, diabetes, prostatitis,genital herpes,urethritis and STD\u2019s like Gonorrhea and Syphilis but they are less likely in your case.I would suggest you to keep the area clean and wear cotton underwears.Also apply a mild steroid cream on the penis. If the symptoms persist then the above said conditions have to be ruled out. Please consult a urologist in that case.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
