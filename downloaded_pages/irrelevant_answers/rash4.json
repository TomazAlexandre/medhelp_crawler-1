            "answer": "Hi there, and welcome to the forum.This place becomes such a great friend during Tx. Just remember that the posts and replies here are from a number of very well versed and cluey people who have been through treatment once or 4 times, or are going through treatment. There also people who post who aren't traveling so well, so try not to feel that these comments are the norm, or that there aren't people out there who are going along OK.So, the rashes. It is important to get on top of these as soon as they present. You will need a body wash that is mild, and a moisturizing lotion (Aveena do good products) to apply a few times a day from the very start. Over the counter meds, when you first espy any rashes, are usually too mild to contain. You will need to get cortisone cream from your doctor, and perhaps antihistamines. PLEASE DON\"T IGNORE THE RASHES. It is a common reason for treatment to be stopped before time.Diarrhoea and anal itching and bleeding. Very common, especially in the early stages of taking Incevik. A cream such as Proctosedyl to apply to area, baby wipes (but not a homebrand) to calm down after going to the loo, and Imodium for the diarrhoea.Eating 20grams of fat with Incivek. This is incredibly important to lessen nausea, diarrhoea and to assist in the absorption of the drug. Hard to do, but if you need tips on what to eat to get the most fat, and some ideas for preparing food, just ask. Also, important to take Incivek every 8 hours.Hair falling out. Mainly a Sx with the Interferon, and be aware. Mine falls out at 10am and 4pm. I have half left. But I had a lot to start. It grows back. One just has to put ego and pride a little aside during Tx. Its just for a short time really in the scheme of things. Hair grows back eventually, and maybe curlier or straighter than before.Low hemoglobin and platelets seem to also be a problem with Incevik, so just be aware that tiredness, lack of energy, dizziness, anemia etc are also Sx.And lastly, I'm not sure about diabetes. Someone else can talk about that.If you have hypothyroidism, keep an eye on all that.And if you have time, you say you start in 48 hours so not much time, I would've suggested you go for a dental checkup, as gum bleeding can be an issue. And also, get your eyes checked, as blurring in one or both eyes can occur, and it's always good to know what is going on before anything goes wrong!Good luck. Welcome to the rough ride. But SVR is on the other side.Keep asking and posting.",

            "answer": "Are you already Diabetic? If you are already diabetic and on Insulin (or possibly oral meds) be sure to keep a very close eye on your blood sugar. Some people who are doing treatment do have problems with fluctuating blood sugars while on treatment. One guy ended up stopping his insulin because the blood sugar got too low while he was on treatment.Rash ... I had it. If you get a rash, get on top of it immediately. The rash can and will snowball out of control. If you get a rash, post here on the forum and we can respond according to what type of rash you have.\u00a0\u00a0I ended up taking prescription meds for the rash because the over the counter meds did nothing. I used Hydroxyzine 50 mg every 6 hours orally, and topically I used Dluocinonide ointment for body, clobetesol soln. for scalp, and hydrocortisone valerate for my face. These are all steroid creams and ointments. Use a good hypoallergenic moisterizing lotion whether you get the rash or not.Hair ... I lost about a third or a half of it but I don't think anyone noticed it. Mine thinned out. It did not come out in clumps. So it was just very thin, noticeable to me, but not to anyone else.Anal issues ... I got them. Keep your stools firm, quite firm. If the get soft or loose you will have more problems. I used Loperimide to keep my stools quite firm. Also, keep the anal area and buttocks spotless. Either use Huggies baby wipes or take a shower and get every single piece of stool off of the external area. Then, if needed, you can apply desitin or A&D or Butt Balm or Baneal. If you get hemorrhoids, Prep H suppositories and cream help. Also, xylocaine with hydrocortisone cream works well to numb the area (prescription). Annusol supp. (prescription) are better than Prep H supp. Sitz baths help if you get hemorrhoids or the burning outer butt.Post on the forum if you get side effects. We will respond.Best of luck.",

            "answer": "MorganI am type 2 dia and on wk 10 of the 3 prong. My BS have been running low during this tx. I keep taking my diabetic meds but diet is on hold until end of incevik.I too am gen 1 and I am hanging in there. I have been working FT. Taking injection on Fri Eve. But still rough on Mondays.I started taking Zoloft 2 wks prior to tx to ward off the mood swings, they do happen. Also before tx I started taking melatonin to establish a good sleep pattern and have not had a problem. I also take a benadryl at the same time and I think it has helped combat the itching.W/ incivek I targeted 30gm of fat for max absorption. Along with a probiotic twice a day helped keep things firm.Rash has been present but not dominate.The unknown is scary but you will do well, I hope these tips help you out, they did me. I have my diabetes GP managing my SX and signed a release w/ my heptologist\u00a0\u00a0to share info. Hang in there and keep in touch if you need some assist.M",
