            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Numbness in calf and feet can be due to pinched nerve in the lower back (sciatica or lumbar spinal nerve getting pinched), Vit B12 deficiency, peripheral neuropathy of diabetes, hypothyroidism or Lymes, poor circulation, rheumatoid arthritis or Raynaud\u2019s disease.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP as soon as possible to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",
