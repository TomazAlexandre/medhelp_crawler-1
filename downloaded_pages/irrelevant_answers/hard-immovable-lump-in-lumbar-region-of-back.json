    "question": "I have had a hard, immovable lump deep in my skin (that is, it's not visible by the naked eye, it can only be palpated) in my lumbar region of my lower back (to the right of my spine).\u00a0\u00a0I estimate it is about 1 inch in diameter and it is painless.\u00a0\u00a0It feels smooth and regularly shaped (feels somewhat domed and circular, like a tennis ball).\u00a0\u00a0I have had this lump for almost a year now and I'm almost positive it has NOT increased in size.I have no other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I will say this lump is situated in a roll of fat.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 5'7\" and 210 (have gained about 20 pounds in the last three years) so I do have plenty of fat in this region and am hoping it is a benign lipoma.I have had recent (within three months) blood tests and all were fine (except for high triglycerides which has been an ongoing issue, and I expected this in the tests).\u00a0\u00a0I don't have diabetes or any other chronic condition.\u00a0\u00a0I've also had a sonogram of my abdomen (gallbladder, liver, etc) within three months as well a a CT scan of that area and all was normal.What could this be?\u00a0\u00a0I really hope it's not the big \"C\" -- If I've had this lump for so long now without it growing larger and no symptoms, isn't that a good sign it's NOT cancer?",
