            "answer": "What are you referring to when you say the doctor said it's hormones...the diabetes? I am diagnosed with having Adult Diabetes Type 2. I know mine is genetic because my mom and dad both have/had this disorder. I take a variety of different medications to help with my blood sugars. The two main ones that I take are Metformin and an inject-able pen medication called Byetta. Both help me to keep my blood sugars to a manageable level.I can't really tell you exactly how to keep your blood sugars from spiking during the morning.Each persons metabolism is a bit different from each other so what may work for me, may not work for you. I would suggest that you speak to your doctor and see what he or she recommends that you do. I could give you advice since I am a diabetic myself. However, if I gave you the wrong advice,since I am still learning about my disorder myself,\u00a0\u00a0it could do more harm than good.",

            "answer": "Hello,how high is the morning spike?High blood sugar in the mornings only (without eating) can be an early sign of diabetes, and you can also look up 'dawn phenomenon'.Did your doctor do any other testing?\u00a0\u00a0It would also be good to know what your numbers are 2 hours after eating, and what you HBA1C (an average of blood sugars for about past 3 months) is?In meantime, please focus on lower carb diet, exercising regularly, and normalising weight if you are overweight.Do not just accept that it is 'hormone'.\u00a0\u00a0High blood sugar is not normal.",

            "answer": "Sally provided good suggestions, please follow her advice. You might want to follow-up by asking the doctor to explain things in terms that you can understand. In this day age you also might ask if email is an option to ask questions and what time frame an answer can be expected. My doc/s reply back early morning or when their shift expires at days end, but always within 24 hrs. If you doc does neither, go find one that does. Good luck -",
