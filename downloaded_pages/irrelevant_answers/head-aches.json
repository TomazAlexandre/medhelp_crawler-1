    "question": "I have been having headaches and diziness when i wake up in the morning- off and on for the past 18months. I loose my balance and my vision gets foggy, but it doesn't last a long time. Feels like i had alot of shots of alcohol and i am getting up for the first time. I had an MRI done with no success, tested for diabetes, but I am still unsure what it is. i was told it was cluster headaches and given medication, but it did not help and i stopped the medication per md request. i eat reqularlly and average, not before bed. I've tried to eat prior to bed and still wake up the same way.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas?*please note i drink socially once a month and do not take any medications*Also, around the same time this started to happen i began having bladder incontinence as well as a numbness in my (L) thigh, just in an elongated two by 9inch strip, the doctor actually stuck needles into the area and i didn't feel it. The neurologist said that it was because i am overweight. Is \"you're fat\" really the answer? The numbness has dicipated slightly since then - i am the same weight now if not more.",
