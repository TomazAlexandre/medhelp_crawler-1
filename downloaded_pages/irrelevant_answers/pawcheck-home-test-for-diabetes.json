            "answer": "good job on being proactive. The home tests are quite accurate, they look for glucose within the urine and I would guess they are 99% accurate. Generally though we watch for clinical symptoms, specifically drinking and urinating more. By the time the glucose overrides the kidneys filtration system and shows up in the urine, your dog would be showing signs. More importantly, speak with your vet about weight loss strategies. Like in people, diabetes in pets can usuallybe prevented through maintaining a proper weight. Your dog will have more energy, arthritis will be less of a concern, even cancer rates are lower in lean dogs and cats.Good luck.",
