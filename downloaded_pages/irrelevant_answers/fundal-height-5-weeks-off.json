They did growth ultrasounds like every 2 weeks and just explained he was a big boy.\u00a0\u00a0I ended up being induced at 36 weeks due to pain I was experiencing from an ovarian cyst. My son was born an 8 lb preemie. :)",

            "answer": "I am glad I'm not alone! I was a little shocked and secretly excited that he may come earlier than 40 weeks! But, I am very scared of having a baby that's too big for me to push.I am 5'9\" and my husband is 6'5\".\u00a0\u00a0I also have a very long torso, even for my height. My first child was a girl, came 6 days early, and was just shy of 9 lbs. This is my first child with my husband though, so I don't know what to expect! Just starting to get a little nervous since I've been worried about size my whole pregnancy. This just confirms my fears!",

    "question": "Okay. So my husband and I are very tall people, and I always knew I would have big babies.I went to my 30 week appointment today and my fundal height measured in at 35 cm, which is on point for someone who is 35 weeks pregnant, but obviouspy way to big for me! I have not had extreme weight gain, I am not over weight, I do not have gestational diabetes, or anything! I am going back in two weeks and giving my measurements one more shot. If they are still way off I will be having a growth ultrasound to check on baby boy.My question is, has anyone else dealt with this, and what happened? Did your baby come early? Did they have to induce you?",
