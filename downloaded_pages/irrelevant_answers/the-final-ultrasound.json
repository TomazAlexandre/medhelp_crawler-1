            "answer": "My last one was during my 20th week with my first child - and I don't expect another with this pregnancy either (got my last at 19 weeks).Unless your fundal height is measuring way off, or you're high risk for some reason, there is generally no reason to do an ultrasound so late in pregnancy. An ultrasound will not accurately tell you the weight of your baby - the estimates can be (and often are) off by two pounds or even more. They can figure out length, but weight is just a guess.",
