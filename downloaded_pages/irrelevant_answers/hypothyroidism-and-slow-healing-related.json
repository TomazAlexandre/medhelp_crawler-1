            "answer": "Thanks for your opinion!My dad is diabetic. So I'm sure I could actually just run a blood sugar test if I wanted to.I didn't realize that they were really related. That kind of worries me now. I just figured if that were ever to come around, I would know for sure from certain symptoms. I guess I will get that checked out ASAP.",

    "question": "I forgot to ask my doctor when I was there last week, but I'll be seeing him again soon to get my blood drawn to see my new TSH levels.I'm curious if hypothyroidism and a slow healing process have anything related. I've always felt like I've healed slower than the average person, but I hadn't realized how tired I was all the time until my freshman year of college, I'm now going to be a junior. My brother seems like he will have a cut/scrape and it will heal within a few days to a week, whereas if I were to have a cut/scrape it might not heal for weeks to a month. It's rather frustrating.I just wanted some opinions because I was thinking about getting a tattoo, but I don't know how the healing process would be...Thanks!",
