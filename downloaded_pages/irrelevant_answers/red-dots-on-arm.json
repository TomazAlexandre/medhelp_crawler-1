    "question": "Something has been wrong with my mom's left arm for the past few months. When she lifts up her arms, she gets the feeling that her left arm, in particular, \"falls asleep\" even after few seconds. She also noticed that her fingers and hand becomes white and her entire arm turns red. Now she has these small red dots (smaller than a mm) clustered on her inner arm near the elbow. This is only apparent with her left arm. What could be the cause of this? Is something preventing regular blood flow to my mom's left arm?*I have attached the picture of the red dots on my mom's arm. Hope this helps",
