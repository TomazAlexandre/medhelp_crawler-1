            "answer": "Hi,You could be having tension headaches or the headaches could be due to your blood pressure or hyploglycemic episodes which are not so uncommon in pregnancy.

Do not exert yourself. Adeuate sleep is important and so is avoidance of alcohol and smoking.

            "answer": "Hi,Pregnancy causes several changes in the body. Although the weigh\u00a0\u00a0of the twins may cause some tension on your spine and may also cause some headaches, hormonal changes may also be a factor.Have you consulted with your OB/GYN regarding your blood pressure?Any diabetes, hypertension or history of cardiac problems?Do you still have persistent vomiting?What is wrong with your vision? Any blurring of vision?Increased blood pressure may also cause headaches and in pregnancy ,we have to consider the presence of preeclampsia which warrants medical intervention. I suggest you seek your OB opinion about this.I hope this helps.Good luck !",

    "question": "Hi - I am 25 weeks pregnant with twins and for the last 8 weeks I have had an afternoon neck/headache. It sometimes last only 5 minutes and other times for up to half an hour. I have never had this in the morning or at night. It is effected only by the movement of leaning forward, standing up or sitting down and is a dull pain. It isn't debilitating but just a little worrying. It seems to radiate from my neck, and when it comes on it causes pain when I move my right eye to the far left. I have had two examinations by an Ophthamologist and my optic nerve is normal. Is this a tension headache?",
