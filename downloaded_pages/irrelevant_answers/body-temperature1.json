            "answer": "I found these posts thanks to a google search on the topic. I have Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Sjogrens Syndrome, and Hypothyroidism. It has only been a couple of years since being diagnosed but this problem with regulating my body temperature are escalating. I see a Rheumatologist, Endocrinologist, and Primary Care Physician. I feel like they all see this as not a big problem and I'm tired of getting the \"there's nothing I can do to help you\" attitude. I have gone from just a nuisance to completely affecting my life and a very severe issue. I can relate to all of you. I no longer leave the house or socialize because I'm constantly sweating with no exertion. I recently lost my job, lost a job interview, been embarrassed in front of my son's teachers, and much more because I'm wearing sweaters and sweating at the same time. Someone please help! I'm not just embarrassed, I can't function anymore!",

    "question": "My question is this. Is there a real disorder that has to do with regulating your body temperature? It seems as though in the winter I get a lot colder then everyone else, and I have a hard time getting warm once i get cold.\u00a0\u00a0In the summer if it is very hot and humid i tend to sweat a lot more then other people, and cant cool down as quickly.\u00a0\u00a0I do have a history of dehydration. While pregnant I went into pre labor due to this fact.\u00a0\u00a0My face tends to get very red when I exercise even if i feel fine and not overly hot or tired.\u00a0\u00a0 People think I am faking, and that I am just being childish, but I seriously can't stand one extreme or the other when it comes to temperatures.
