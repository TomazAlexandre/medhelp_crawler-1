            "answer": "Most fruits are high in sugar, some more so than others.\u00a0\u00a0Even though the sugar in fruit is \"natural\", it still spikes your blood sugar, which causes the pancreas to pump out more insulin.\u00a0\u00a0If this happens regularly, your body may become resistant to insulin, which could lead to type II diabetes.It's best to limit fruit to 1-2 servings/day and try to stick with things like berries, apples, pears, which are chock full of fiber.Bananas contain more sugar than all most all other fruits, plus the most calories/serving.\u00a0\u00a0You might consider limiting those even more.",

    "question": "I'm very calorie conscious, but I love fruit, and feel groggy and unclean if I go long periods of time without eating it! I don't want to cut them out, but I understand they are a source of carbs and natural sugar. I do watch my portions, and eat about a piece of fruit with every meal. I eat breakfast, snack, lunch, another snack, and dinner. I do cheat sometimes, but my goal is to keep insulin regulated. I don't drink soda or fruit juice, just water and the occasional coffee. Any advice on diabetes prevention? I definitely don't want to develop that, and I want my body to be at its fat burning peak. Thanks!",
