            "answer": "I just wrote about this in another post. I had GD with my first child. I'm about 7 weeks with my second and am expecting to have it again. I know it's scary believe me. I was scared ******** when I found out. After I saw a nutritionist and started doing research on GD and diabetic diets, I started to calm down. Turns out, I was able to control my GD with diet alone. I just really had to pay attention to what I was eating and the carb to protein ratios. In the end, everything turned out just fine. My son was born perfectly healthy. He was just bigger than normal - 9 lbs 14oz. My doctors said there was no way to determine if that was from the GD or the fact that my husband was that large when he was born. (Or a combo of both) I still had a vaginal delivery though with no complications.It's impossible not to worry, I know. But if you listen to your doctors and closely monitor your diet and blood sugar you and your baby will be fine.",
