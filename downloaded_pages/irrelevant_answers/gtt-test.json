            "answer": "You can ask for your results. When you do get them it would be great if you could post them here.Are you testing fasting, or after eating? If your testing it fasting and it's 65 that's low. If you've ate something and it's around 100 that's pretty normal.It looks to me like when they did the 3 hour test your sugar kept dropping, which would indicate hypoglycemia.I wish I could be of more help to you. I hope you can get your results and post them. We have a wonderful diabetes forum here if you want to post your question there. Take care. Remar",

            "answer": "Usually you can start feeling effects in the upper 70's. When mine gets into the 70's or low 80's I feel weak and dizzy. I don't have diabetes. I know I need to eat something though.It's normal for your pulse to drop at night when your sleeping. Resting pulse during the day is around 75.Is your pulse dropping when your awake at night?I see that your young and would'nt think about heart problems but you might want to get further testing in that area.An echo won't tell you everything.\u00a0\u00a0Your Dr might want you to take a treadmill test and or put a 24 hour heart monitor on you. Don't worry if they recommend that. You wear it at home. I had one done. And the treadmill is a breeze.Yes, you can get dizzy and feel faint if your blood sugar drops. But the chest and back pain does'nt fit. Let me do some more research to see if those are symptoms. I'll get back to you shortly. Take care. Remar",
