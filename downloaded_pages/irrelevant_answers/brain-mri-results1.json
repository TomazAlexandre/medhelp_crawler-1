            "answer": "I am having quite a few MS symptoms. Legs arms going numb and tingling, memory impaired, muscle spasms, and blurred vision sometimes. Does that only lead to MS? I think I may just schedule the lumbar puncture. Will that give me more concrete evidence? Thanks so much!",

    "question": "My neurologist said to wait 6 months then get another mri. I wonder if I need a second opinion or justgo ahead and ask him to set me up for the lumbar puncture?There is Left maxillary sinus mucosal disease.The skull and visual soft tissues are unremarkable.No shift of midline intracranial structures.the calibers of the ventricles, sulci, and basli cisterns, are within normal limits.There is no evidence of intra or extra hemmoragh or masses.CONCLUSIONS:There are dozens foci of grossly abnormal T2 signal hyperintensities mainly in the subcortical white matter. The largest focus measures approx. 5mm. The foci are mainly supratentorial and do not enhance with gadolinium. These do not have specific morphology. The differential includes chronic microvascular ishchemic changes if this 43 yo female has a history of diabetes, hypertension or hyperlipidemia.In the absence (yep I have none of those) of that history, other considerations include vasculitis, MS, and redidua of encephalitis.",
