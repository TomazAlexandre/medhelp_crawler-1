            "answer": "I could be mistaken\u00a0\u00a0- but I have looked the evidence over and talked with people here and the theory of RAI and cancer you talk about is reversed.\u00a0\u00a0I as an RAI patients back in 2003 was recently informed by an ENT that people that do have RAI - that develop nodules are at a higher risk on the nodule being carcimona. That is not very enlightening for me b/c they found I do have a solid nodule now.I am on Armour - no there is no blood.\u00a0\u00a0 //// yuckie.....Graves speeds up your body. - so that effects many things. heart rate sugar levels - blood going through your body etc. That is basically the deal on that. I thyroid stormed in 2003 before RAI --- not fun at all. thought I was having the big one. If you Thyroid storm too long - it could develop into heart failure. That is why if your TSH starts to peak to that direction - you need to seek medical treatment right away. It takes a very long time 4-6 weeks for anti-thyroid meds to move that TSH back into a safe range. If the doctor feels you need faster treatment - he /she will lean towards RAI\u00a0\u00a0- at least that was my explaination I was given at that time.Good Luck",

    "question": "I was told by my ENDO that by doing the RAI therapy that people that do that rarely get cancer of the thyroid. I had the RAI in '95 and I guess I was wondering if this is true? My TSH levels keep going up. I have to increase my synthroid. Started out at .50 and now at .175. Was still curious about this \"rarely get cancer\" statement. They told me that President Bush Sr. and his wife and dog did the RAI therapy. lol So that is what persuaded me into doing it. If it's good enough for the President then it's safe and good enough for me. Doh'Another quick question: Is Amour Natural Meds made out of Pig's thyroid? Does it contain blood components? I was a practicing Jehovah's Witness and refuse anything with Blood. Plus, I have been on Synthroid since 1995 and was wondering what is all the hype about it? Why don't ppl like it? Fill me in. lolMy ENDO's name was Rickard Schnute (pronounced SNOOTY) Like nose up in the air.. lol He retired.Why does High blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes go hand in hand with Graves Disease turned\u00a0\u00a0hypothyroidism?WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY???? Are ya sick of me yet? (in a spongebob sorta voice)I have grandchildren okay. LMAOOne last question for the day..What is a THYROID STORM and please dear LORD help me from getting one or going through one?I dont want one. Im scared of storms.tyLinda",
