    "question": "My neck has been sore for about 3 months and the feeling is hard to swallow, when I yawn that hurts and it's not inside the throat area, it seems to be the muscles in the front of my neck. From my jaw down to the collarbone and on both sides in the center.\u00a0\u00a0I've had a doctor look at it and said that there was no nodules or goiter and the TSH came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0My question is, is could this be the feeling of Hashimoto in progress attacking the thyroid?\u00a0\u00a0I have huge auto-ammune history in my family.Thanks for any help",
