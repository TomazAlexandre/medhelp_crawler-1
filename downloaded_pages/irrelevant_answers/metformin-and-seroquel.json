            "answer": "My doctor mentioned this possibility at my last visit after discussing the weight gain problem. I have gained 25 lbs in the last 9 months or so, more so after d/c'ing the Wellbutrin I was taking along with Seroquel.Metformin is a diabetes drug that basically lowers blood sugar. Apparently Seroqual and other drugs like it affect the way the body metabolizes glucose. It seems apparent from my current research of many message boards that diet and exercise, unless done in excess, do not help with the weight loss on these drugs.I have decided to try a very competent acupuncturist who specializes in working with side effects such as this. Will post here if results are good. Please update your results with the metformin.Thanks",
