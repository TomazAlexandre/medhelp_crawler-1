            "answer": "I'm assuming this is by fundal height. Does your doctor intend to do an ultrasound? While its not normal to measure so far off, I personally measured 7 weeks behind at 33 weeks and my daughter was perfectly fine. There are several things that can cause it to be off, but an ultrasound is especially important to make sure there's no underlying issues.",

            "answer": "You could just have a large amount of fluid or baby could be laying odd which can cause it to be different. If he doesn't measure in the exact same spot each time it will be off as well.",

    "question": "I recently just went to the doctor for my 33 weeks appointment, and he said I am already measuring at 41 weeks, do you think maybe my due date is off or could she just be a really big baby. I've proceeded to lose about 15 lbs since I have been pregnant, so its not me getting day. Any ideas?",
