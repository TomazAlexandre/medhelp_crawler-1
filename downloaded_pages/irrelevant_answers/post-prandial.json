            "answer": "I had issues with hypoglycemia for quite a while.\u00a0\u00a0Then it turned and went to hyperglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe you should have a glucose tolerance test done where you fast for ~12 hours, they draw blood, have you drink a sugary drink and test again.\u00a0\u00a0Mine stayed at 239 after 3 hours.\u00a0\u00a0Another test to ask your Dr. about is an A1C.\u00a0\u00a0(I hope I put that right)\u00a0\u00a0Anyhow it will give your blood sugar level over the previous 3 months.As for Diabetic food...I found a great site:http://www.everydayhealth.com/publicsite/recipes/viewall.aspx?filterletter=PJust look for the recipes that you need health wise.\u00a0\u00a0You can find ones for diabetics, heart issues, gerd etc.As for me I eat pretty healthy.\u00a0\u00a0My problem is not eating often enough.\u00a0\u00a0You really have to force yourself sometimes to eat 3 times a day.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that helps you a little.Hopefully someone else can answer better than I.\u00a0\u00a0Just my two cents worth.\u00a0\u00a0;-)Best of wishes;\u00a0\u00a0Amy.",

            "answer": "I apologize in advance if this double posts.First the technician is partly correct. Your 112 mg/dl fasting level puts you into the prediabetes category.Normal 70-99 mg/dlPrediabtes 100-124 mg/dlDiabetes Type 2 126 mg/dl and aboveYou can reverse your glucose levels now with a little lifestyle change. Once you hit 1265 mg/dl there is no turning back. Changing lifestyle habits can go a long way in controlling type 2 diabetes. Here's a few tips: Restrict & avoid refined sugars, practice and adhere to weight control, do some sort of exercise daily, practice stress management, and get adequate sleep. These are all important in managing this illness, the most important, along with proper nutrition, is physical activity.Besides watching sugar in your diet-- you also need to watch carbohydrates (starches) carefully too. For example-- things like breads, potatoes, pasta, crackers, etc. can cause a drastic rise in your blood sugar if you aren't careful. (They are converted to sugar after you eat them.) I recently discovered a brand of pasta that doesn't raise my glucose levels above normal levels. Dreamfields claims their mfg process removes most of the digestible carbs. You'll have to Google to find a store that sells this brand. In Calif, Safeway stocks them along with Whole Foods.Other foods/drinks need care too (example- milk, fruit, fruit juice) can also cause blood sugar to rise (so serving sizes and moderation are important). I'm NOT saying that these foods aren't allowed. What I AM saying is that you need to use care and follow the guidelines for diabetics.If you have an endocrinologist (or a diabetes nurse, or a nutritionist)-- they can help you a lot with nutritional guidelines. (Serving sizes, and how many servings of each type food that's safe for you.) Internet recipes are bogus as most contain sugar or bad carbs. Learn and understand the Glycemic Index for healthy and nutritional foods.http://www.becomehealthynow.com/article/carbs/8/If you don't have a home glucose test meter ask your doctor for one. Or do as I did, wait six weeks for a free Johnson & Johnson Ultra Mini (ranked #1 by Consumer Reports). However, you will need to resupply the lancets and test strips for J&J only supplies you with a 5-10 day supply. You need to test b4 meals and 2-3 hours after meals to see which foods spike your glucose and those that do not. https://www.onetouchgold.com/simplestart/Lastly, you pic shows you on cutter rigged foredeck. The other pic looks like she's a woodie and a nice blue water cruiser. Mine is named Aqua-Holic, more race than cruise.",

It answers many questions I have been trying to research ,I thought I had Lyme /Lupus but its obviously ly unstable sugar levels.I think I get hives when I eat too much sugar.
