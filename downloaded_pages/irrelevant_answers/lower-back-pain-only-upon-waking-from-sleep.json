            "answer": "Dear Toni,Your symptoms may be caused by vesicoureteral reflux.Vesicoureteral\u00a0\u00a0reflux (VUR) is a condition where urine from the bladder flows back up into the ureter.due to a congenital defect at the ureterovesical junction (where the ureter inserts into the bladder) or from high pressure within the bladder.\u00a0\u00a0The latter can be caused by bladder outlet obstruction (usually in males), neurogenic bladder (from spinal cord injury, diabetes, multiple sclerosis), bladder instability, or bladder infection(which can cause decreased bladder compliance).\u00a0\u00a0Reflux most commonly occurs in children, and it affects females predominantly.\u00a0\u00a0The majority of people with reflux are asymptomatic.\u00a0\u00a0However, one may have symptoms of a urinary tract infection and abdominal or flank pain with a full bladder.\u00a0\u00a0Prolonged VUR can result in renal scarring, pyelonephritis (infection of the kidney), hypertension, and renal failure. Initial diagnostic work up include a complete history and physical exam,\u00a0\u00a0a urine analysis and culture, renal ultrasound, and a VCUG.\u00a0\u00a0Medical (antibiotics/ bladder muscle relaxant) and surgical treatments can be offered for those with VUR depending on the etiology and severity of the disease.This information is provided for general medical education purposes only.\u00a0\u00a0Please consult your physician for diagnostic and treatment options pertaining to your specific medical condition.

    "question": "Each morning, I wake up with intense lower back pain. After I urinate the pain stops.\u00a0\u00a0this occurs daily. This has been going on for approximately 8 months. About six months ago, I went to the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0He found blood in my urine.\u00a0\u00a0He gave me anibotic.\u00a0\u00a0After about two weeks the pain stopped.\u00a0\u00a0However, the pain started up again a month later. I went back to the doctor. He took a urine test.\u00a0\u00a0the test was negetive. This is the only symptom I have.\u00a0\u00a0However, sometimes I think my weight gain is bloat, but it is possible the fudge during the holiday season may\u00a0\u00a0be a contributing factor.\u00a0\u00a0Hope you can help.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, Toni",
