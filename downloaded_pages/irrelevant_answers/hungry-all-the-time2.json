Stella , i don't have low immune system , I'm hardly ever sick I mean such as cold or other things.This winter I had usual sore throat that i left untreated for a week or two before visiting a doctor and was diagnosed with tonsillitis. After that my throat is only sore in mornings and I have fatigue and sleep disturbances,often urination most of it is thyroid symptoms that could have been effected too and worsen by use of antibiotics to treat tonsillitis. i just wanted to get someone else opinion but it seems like I have to visit physician",

There is no pain but when I wake up the middle part of my throat is sore a little and it's feels uncomfortable. Last night I was so hungry all the time that I couldn't even sleep properly.I was tested for thyroid in April this year and it was normal, I was tested for diabetes in June and I was not a diabeticIs there any specific foods to kill hunger if it's my thyroid? Is there any good multi vitamins that I can take? I really want to avoid antibiotics and other unhealthy pillsI do exercise dailyThanks",
