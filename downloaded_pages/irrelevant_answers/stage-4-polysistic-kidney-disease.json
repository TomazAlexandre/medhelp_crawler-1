            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Understand your predicament mam. But the progression of polycystic disease cannot be controlled, only the symptoms can be kept in check. For bladder infections, practice these lifestyle changes they will help in the long run. For relief from pain apply heated pads, drink plenty of oral fluids and take frequent sitz baths for 15-20 mins. Prevention of episodes is by urinating frequently, practicing good hygiene after each bowel movement, taking showers instead of bath tubs and urinating immediately after intercourse.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
