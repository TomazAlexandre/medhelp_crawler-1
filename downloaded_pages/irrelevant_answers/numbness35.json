            "answer": "Hand numbness and pain can be caused by a number of things, most commonly carpal tunnel syndrome which is pressure on an arm nerve (median nerve) at the wrist. The pain is usually worse while driving, with repetitive hand activities and at night. Another possibility is a problem with a pinched nerve higher up in the neck such as what can happen with a disc problem. Finally, depending on your full clinical history, exam and whether or not you have risk factors (heart disease, smoking, diabetes, etc...) these could represent stroke like symptoms. Start with a general exam by your primary care physician. An EMG which is a test that examines the nerves and muscles can be helpful in figuring out what this may represent. Good luck.",

            "answer": "Hi there, sounds like you have carpal tunnel syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms such has numbness, tingling and even pain are worse at night.\u00a0\u00a0Shaking the hands sometimes makes it feel better.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to try to purchase a carpal tunnel brace and wear it during the day and especially at night to try and relieve your symptoms. Talk to your primary care doctor to set up an EMG/nerve conduction study with a neurologist to look at the nerves in your arm/hand to see if that's indeed what the problem is.\u00a0\u00a0As for the focusing problem you may want to see an eye doctor to rule out anything serious.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes!",
