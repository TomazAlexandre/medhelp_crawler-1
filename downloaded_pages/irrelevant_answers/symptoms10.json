            "answer": "Hi,How are you? There are a number of causes, which can cause numbness in the arm, face and leg, but most commonly it could be due to stroke or compromised blood supply in these areas which is extremely rare to occur.Have you ever got your blood pressure checked? Any kidney problems or diabetes? Are you obese? All these answers can help me to get to a diagnosis. What you mentioned is kind of hemiparesis. Is there any weakness or inability to move voluntarily in the limbs?I would suggest that you get a CT scan brain done and immediately visit a neurologist. You could have had a transient ischaemic attack or a stroke.All the best.",

            "answer": "Unilateral head pain and numbness (though I'm not sure about the tingling sensation you're experiencing) is a classic migraine presentation. If you are indeed, or have had, a transient ischemic attack (TIA), this may also be caused by migraines. Do you have a history of headaches, or has this been an isolated episode?Definitely get evaluated by a Neurologist ASAP.....Nice screen-name, by the way haha :)",
