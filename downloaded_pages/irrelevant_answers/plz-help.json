            "answer": "Your welcome dear. its best to be honest with the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Also some of his pain may be only there because he is still taking the pills, some of us realize that our brains created the pain in order to keep getting fed pain meds. Once he is off and his natural pain relivers start to work and function again he can then assess his pain levels.. It may be bad for a few weeks until things start to work and rebuild again. There is a amino acid he can take that will help rebuild his natural endorphins which are the neurotransmitters that are responsible for pain relief, ITs called DLPA\u00a0\u00a0he cannot take it though if he is taking any anti depressants, has diabetes, or high blood pressure. If he is free of all thoses things he can take it. it can even help with withdrawal symptoms",
