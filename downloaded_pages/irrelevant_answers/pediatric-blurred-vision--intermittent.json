            "answer": "Hi,Convergence Insufficiency (CI) is the leading cause of eyestrain, blurred vision, double vision (diplopia), and/or headaches.Convergence insufficiency disorder can interfere with the ability to read, learn, and work at near (close distances).Patients should be made aware that convergence insufficiency is a fairly common condition and that treatment is very effective.2Treatments range from passive (prism lenses) to active (office-based vision therapy/orthoptics).1-4According to a recent survey, home-based pencil pushups therapy (PPT) is the most commonly prescribed treatment5, but studies show that compliance (patient cooperation) is poor and that this treatment does not eliminate symptoms.3, 6Eye surgery is rarely recommended.1, 2The basic eye exam by a pediatrician is not adequate for the detection of convergence insufficiency (as well as other visual conditions).1A person can pass the 20/20 eye chart test and still have convergence insufficiency.Convergence Insufficiency can be treated at any age.1, 2, 4Consult a Peadiatric Opthalmologist as early as possible.Good luck",
