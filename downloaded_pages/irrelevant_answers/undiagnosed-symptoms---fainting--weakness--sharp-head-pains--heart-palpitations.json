            "answer": "Thanks for the input.\u00a0\u00a0Went in for Echo yesterday at 4pm had results by 6pm.\u00a0\u00a0Cardiologist says everything looked normal and that she didn't even see a prolapse of the valve.\u00a0\u00a0I'm guessing that the diagnosis made 7 years ago was a miss, because I didn't think that MVP could just go away.\u00a0\u00a0That's good news I guess.\u00a0\u00a0Just have to see how the tilt test comes out and the visit with the head doctor.\u00a0\u00a0The off balance feeling and sharp head pains hopefully can be explained by the Neurologist.Thank you again.",

    "question": "Hi!\u00a0\u00a0I have been having some unexplained medical problems for the past 1 - 1/2 years.\u00a0\u00a0It started with sharp quick pains in the head, sometimes feeling like my head was in a vice.\u00a0\u00a0I would sometimes see white spots or even a whole bunch of colors, & then everything would go black.\u00a0\u00a0This would all happen within a 5 minute time span & then be gone.\u00a0\u00a0I was extremely tired all the time also.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor tested my thyroid, for anemia, and had an MRI of the head done.\u00a0\u00a0Everything came back negative & they ruled it out as stress (which at the time I was under a lot of).\u00a0\u00a0Now, starting this past February I've started having these fainting spells.\u00a0\u00a0I start to feel very off balance, weak, sometimes the sharp head pains accompany this, & then I faint/pass out.\u00a0\u00a0Once I come around a little the heart palpitations start.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed 6 0r 7 years ago with a Mitral Valve Prolapse (minor).\u00a0\u00a0Have never had any real problems with it.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor since has tested me for diabetes, hypoglycemia, again for thyroid problems.\u00a0\u00a0All my blood work looks great they keep telling me.\u00a0\u00a0I have passed out 5 times since February, and the last 4 have been almost a month apart from each other (this last time just happened last night while sitting at dinner with a couple friends).\u00a0\u00a0I am scheduled for an echocardiogram today, a tilt table test next week, & then a trip to the Neurologist in a few weeks.Although it's great hearing that \"nothing\" is wrong.\u00a0\u00a0It's starting to scare me a little, because this can't be normal.Any suggestions, input advice would be greatly appreciated.Thank you.",
