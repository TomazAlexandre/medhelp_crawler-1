            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your brother\u2019s medical problems. First of all if this is transverse myelitis, then was a spinal tap done? A MRI or CT scan will rule out herniated discs, tumors, vertebral canal stenosis and an abscess as the cause of the transverse myelitis or similar neurological symptoms. If these are inconclusive, then a myelogram should be performed. If MRI and myelogram are both negative, then it is thought to be a vascular pathology. Tests are then conducted to look into this.Further blood tests are done to rule out SLE, Sjogren's syndrome, HIV infection, syphilis, and vitamin B12 deficiency as these too can precipitate transverse myelitis like symptoms. Spinal fluid is checked for inflammation, immunoglobulin level and for protein to know whether there is an inflammatory or autoimmune process associated. Sudden loss of sensation or sensory loss is seen in Gullian Barre Syndrome and in toxic neuropathy, leprosy, Lyme\u2019s disease, diabetes, SLE, amyloidosis, and uremic neuropathy. Discuss this with your brother\u2019s neurologist as apparently some of these tests have not been done. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hi there! My brother is 27.He suddenly felt some pain in his lower back on 3rd of January and his legs got numb though there was movement in tows and slight in right leg as well. At night both legs got numb. First he was diagnosed GB syndrome but after 3 days treatment, doctors said that it's Transverse Myelitis and not virus as all the tests including MRI were clear and only minute inflammation was observed later on by the radiologist. He was on steroids for 5 days(solumedrol) and now he is on deltacortril\u00a0\u00a0tablets and also physiotherapy is going on but there is still no improvement and he still can't move his legs. Kindly do suggest how speedy recovery could be possible, thanks",
