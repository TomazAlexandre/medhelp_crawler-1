            "answer": "Yes it's important to test her tyroid levels (could be the case) but because she's having 3-4 episodes a month she must figure out other possibilities. She should do a 24 hour urine to measure cathecolamines, and do a full blood count with creatinine, ureia, ..... (see how her kidneys are working), also it's important to do a ionogram (potassium . chloride, sodium), calcium and phosphorus, sugar (diabetes) and other hormones like aldosterone, cortisol, etc.When she started to be medicated for the blood pressure? why 3 meds for it? was a cardilogist? Did she ruled out problems with her heart?",
