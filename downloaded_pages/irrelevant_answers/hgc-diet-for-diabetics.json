            "answer": "From what I read, the original HCG treatment consisted of daily shots of that hormone plus an extreme diet of 500 calories, and there was no medical evidence that it worked. It got popular (as fad diets do) and now they sell homeopathic (oral) versions of the hcg that have unknown ingredients and doses. Fad diets don't work and are dangerous for diabetics. I know it is hard to lose weight at your mother's age. But it sounds like she needs to just keep reducing carbs and fat and adding more exercise to her days and she will slowly lose weight. If she hasn't been tested for thyroid, she might want to do this to make sure a thyroid problem isn't interfering with her ability to lose.",

            "answer": "Your mother needs to understand the difference between proper nutrition and diets. Proper nutrition means to accentuate the positive when it comes to food. I dislike the word diet. \u201cDiet\u201d implies a rigorous, self-sacrificial discipline that\u2019s doomed to fail. Instead, proper nutrition means to focus on achieving food goals of what you should eat each day rather than what you shouldn\u2019t eat. When you consume more vegetables, healthy fats [such as olive oil and nuts], lean proteins, low fructose [sugar] fruits - such as berries and melons - combined with low carbohydrate, low calorie, low starchy foods, your hunger will be satisfied and you will naturally want to make better choices.Along these lines, daily exercise helps to not only lose weight but also lower blood glucose levels. I'm a bit puzzled why you are posting and not your mother.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the clarification. Tell you mom to stay away from fad diets and gimmick ads on diabetes. They just don't work. If it sounds too good to be true it's a scam, and hoo-boy there lots of them on the Internet and magazines. What does work is proper nutrition, daily [3-4 times a week] exercise like you're late for a departing plane, and maintaining proper weight. She just needs to work on the latter two. I wish her good health.",

            "answer": "There is a great deal of 'evidence' that HCG protocol is very effective, safe, fast and natural way to lose weight. HCG diet has been used in Europe for decades with great success. It works for everyone. The homeopathic sublingual drops are great for the ease of use, and as effective as the injections. Blood sugar level must be monitored as usual during the diet. Read A.T.W. SIMEONS, M.D's work to understand the whole protocol.",

Wearing the 34s now and eating properly. No sweets or junk food; just three meals per day at about the same time. Carbs no more than 75 per meal ( 60 for females). I have lost 54 lbs and my A1C a month ago was 5.3%. Because of arthritis I don't get as much exercise as I should.
