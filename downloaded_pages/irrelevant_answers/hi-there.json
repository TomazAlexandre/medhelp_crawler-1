            "answer": "Sounds like you have your condition under really good control. Keep up the good work! I have had T1 since I was 20 (I am now 47). My control has been generally good and I don't have any complications. But my HBA1c started creeping up a few years ago. I don't know of age and/or time being a diabetic has anything to do with it.I started taking action when the HBA1c reached 8.8 and an eye exam revealed the first microaneurism. By switching to from NPH to Lantus (which I use with Novolog), starting a regular exercise program, and reducing carbohydrates in my diet, I have got the HBA1c down to 6.2. My objective is to get it down to 5.5.I have 27 years of being T1 behind me. And I am highly motivated to maintain excellent control by the desire to avoid complications and leave a normal life for at least the next 27 years.Cheers,Mark",

            "answer": "Hey Helen. Nice to meet you. Good to hear you've kicked the gak. I had many friends that were cranksters. I was more of a pothead, just liked sleep to much :\u00a0\u00a0) I've kicked the weed and cigarettes but still love my beer. Having kids will sure change your life. I have a 16 month old little girl and wouldn't know what to do without her. Sounds like you have pretty good control. I have never heard of anyone maintaining without daily testing. More power to ya.The first day I noticed \"the thirst\" was the day my daughter was born. We were at the hospital from 3AM to 8PM before she was born. I just couldn't drink enough water! I went on for several weeks drinking like crazy, still being thirsty, and going to the bathroom every 30 minutes. I started to get VERY weak. I had lost 50lbs in about two months and couldn't do the simplest of things without getting tired. Imagine trying to wrestle! I was getting owned in practice. I suffered for two months before I finally figured it out. When my GP finally checked my sugar it was like 500. Then he started me off on Metformin and just about poisened me. I was bedridden for about a week before my mother-in-law stormed into the Diabetes center and demanded they see me. It took an endo about five minutes to figure out I was type 1. They gave me some insulin and I felt 100% in about two hours.",

I still remember drinking 2 gallons of milk, a gallon of apple cider, a gallon of orange juice and who knows how much water that thanksgiving! Jeez, how time flys.\u00a0\u00a0I'm starting to get more scared since I've been getting older.\u00a0\u00a0I have a two year old daughter who has changed my life from five years of meth (tweek) to being Mrs. Mommy, who would've thought! I have experienced a lot in my few years with this disease.\u00a0\u00a0I am still quite the rebel towards this disease but I do try to organize myself once in a while.\u00a0\u00a0I know that I have more to live for than myself now but yet I still manage my diabetes with no testing but rather by feeling what my bloodsugar is at.\u00a0\u00a0And for all of you that don't believe that's possible, talk to my doctor! I have a A1C of 6.5, so there! :) Anyway, I look forward to yapping my mouth to all of you soon.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for listening to my whining! :)",

I can't imagine dealing with T1 as a teen. Prolly have to grow up fast huh. Glad to see you have gotten your numbers down. Keep up the good work.",

            "answer": "Hey Adam, nice to meet you. Disc golf is played like regular golf except with special frisbees. They are a bit different than your normal frisbees. These things are much heavier and can go up to 100yds or more if thrown correctly. You also have driver discs, mid range discs, and putters too. Instead of holes you try to get your frisbee into these metal or plastic baskets with chains on them. You keep score exactly like regular golf (birdie, par, bogey). There are many city parks with these disc golf courses in them. You can find a lot of information on the net about it.",

    "question": "Just found this forum and wanted to say \"Hi\" and introduce myself. I am a 28 year old male with type 1 diabetes. I was diagnosed a little over a year ago on 9/11/03. What a day to pick huh? My father died from\u00a0\u00a0complications of diabetes when he was 27. He was type 1 since childhood. I was only 6 weeks old at the time. Obviously I was quite scared when I learned I had it. I was also a little shocked to learn I had diabetes at my age. I have since learned that age really has nothing to do with type 1.I am happy to say that I am now living quite happily with my condition. I don't even think of myself as even having a disease, I'm just a little different. I am currently taking Humulog with each meal and Lantus at bedtime. My A1c's are averaging about 5.2 and my average blood sugar is about 110!!! I do miss some foods but my diet is pretty flexible.My exercise routine is fun and I really enjoy the people I work out with. I have been training mixed martial arts for about two years now. I have also been competetively competing in sport submission grappling. I am a two time silver medalist in the Southwest Submission Grappling Challenge. I am also an avid disc golfer. It's a lot of fun and great exercise too. How many times can you say you walked 4 miles and had fun doing it?Well, there's a little about me. I'd love to hear from you guys and get to know you. I only know one other person with type 1.",
