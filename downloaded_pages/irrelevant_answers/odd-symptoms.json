            "answer": "Thanks for the reply.\u00a0\u00a0 I mentioned to her once about blurred vision and was told to get my eyes checked out.\u00a0\u00a0This is different though because I'm actually loosing my vision for 10 seconds in which (though a short time) it has me leery about driving now and it's followed by a brief lightheaded spell.At first I thought it could be womanly issues with cysts rupturing or something.\u00a0\u00a0As a teenager I had these episodes happen also where I would lose my vision only back then they would last longer.\u00a0\u00a0It was embarrassing because I could hear people talking I just couldn't see anything or seem to get up.\u00a0\u00a0Back then they said my sugar and heart was fine and chalked it up to hormones.I just had a stress test and echo done a few months ago and it was pretty good.\u00a0\u00a0I'm hoping to get my EF up more though on my next one.\u00a0\u00a0It was 53% and FS was 27%.\u00a0\u00a0Other than that it just mentioned the interatrial septal aneurysm that I have.\u00a0\u00a0My heart is actually smaller in size than last time in which was good.\u00a0\u00a0Or I'm the grinch.\u00a0\u00a0LOLAs I mentioned I put this on 4 forums (heart, thyroid, type ll diabetes and undiagnosed).\u00a0\u00a0On the thyroid forum one person brought up Hashi's and another brought up ketones in the urine.\u00a0\u00a0Today my urine check showed: ketones a trace, SG was 1.030, PH was 5, Protein was 2000 and Leukocytes was moderate.\u00a0\u00a0Sugar mg/dl was 90 this AM in which is great and my BP and HR is 142/92\u00a0\u00a084 in which is getting to be a norm for me until I take my meds.\u00a0\u00a0My question though is the protein?I do have an appointment with a OBGYN Doctor in two weeks to go over CT of the abdomen and pelvis report along with several ultrasounds.\u00a0\u00a0She is on vacation now.\u00a0\u00a0I have been threw a slew of test lately and medical bills up the gazoo.\u00a0\u00a0If I feel as if I'm in danger I will call a family member or ambulance.\u00a0\u00a0I don't feel as if they can find anything else right now though unless it happens right when I'm in there.\u00a0\u00a0Sigh.\u00a0\u00a0In the mean while I'm writing down anything that could be causing this, charting everything and taking it into the office with me.Thank you my friend for your reply and I will keep you posted.\u00a0\u00a0(HUGS)I hope all is well with you.\u00a0\u00a0;~)",

    "question": "Ok I'm going to post this on a few different forums because I'm not sure which way to go on this:I've been having issues with blood pressure fluctuations, lightheaded spells and losing my vision for ~10 seconds everything goes back, then I'm lightheaded for a minute or two and it leaves as quick as it came.After eating (sometimes while eating too) I'm sweating (whether I'm cold or hot) in the face and my hair and neck.\u00a0\u00a0The spells where I get lightheaded, sweat and black out can happen at any given time.\u00a0\u00a0These have been happening daily now for about a week and 3-4 times a day where everything goes black and the waves of lightheadedness is really making me angry.I have an appointment with an OBGYN concerning issues with cysts in two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I questioned \"hormonal\" issues.\u00a0\u00a0I'm also questioning\u00a0\u00a0\"thyroid\" (though my numbers I think are pretty good, I'm always cold and my hair is thinning out again),\u00a0\u00a0type ll diabetes (maybe dropping to low at times, but maybe that's reaching for straws) or \"heart\" issues (due to BP fluctuations and palpitations/pains, sweating, headaches or heartburn lately.\u00a0\u00a0Urggg.I've been forcing myself to eat every 2-3 hours and have been drinking a lot of water, just in case it could be sugar related even though my numbers seem to be between 70-120 or so.\u00a0\u00a0 I don't think they're bad enough to be causing this because a lot of times it's around 100.I'm honestly worried about telling her about the black out spells to in fear of loosing my drivers license.\u00a0\u00a0Anything to ask my doctor about would be appreciated.Thank you in advance.",
