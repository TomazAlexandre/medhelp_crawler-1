            "answer": "Actually your numbers are not alarming, the elevations are mild. And people with type-2 diabetes have been known to have elevated liver enzymes that, in part, reflect underlying insulin resistance. Keep in mind that your liver plays an important part in the bodies regulation of serum glucose levels, but this process is pretty complicated and not well understood.Also, many people with diabetes have fatty livers which can cause mild elevations. So you will need to work with your doctor to figure out what exactly is going on in your case. We can only guess here with the numbers you've provided.But following a liver friendly diet - low on processed food, low in sugar content and by using coconut oils instead of animal fats, etc - to minimize the amount of fat stored in your liver cells, will help. If your doctor can have an ultrasound done of your liver, they should be able to tell you whether or not you have any significant fatty liver.Your serum globulin level is normal, and your RBC is only slightly elevated which is nothing to worry about, unless is becomes higher and remains chronic. Take care and hope your doctor can narrow things down for you.",
