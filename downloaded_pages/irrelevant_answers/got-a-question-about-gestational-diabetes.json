            "answer": "Hi, I have GD also and no matter what I do for the past week or so my fasting number is always high in the morning! I usually stop eating around 8:30pm so that I can wake up and be fine but it never fails im always over. I saw my obgyn on Tues and she was going to start me on a pill instead of going right to insulin but then she told me instead of not eating right before bed try something with protein. That didnt help and my dietician ended up putting me on the pill yesterday. This morning my number was low. So i would say try something protein until u can get to an actual appt.",

            "answer": "Thank you. I will try to get more protein in my meals until I see the doctor or dietition. It's so stressful and frustrating that I follow my diet and still seems I'm doing something wrong :( I don't want to do anything to cause problems to my son. Hopefully my doctor will try the pill with me too . Until then I guess I just have to try more protein and if my sugar levels are high at night still then I'll bring them down. Its hard because my schedule is screwey. My husband works 2nd shift so I eat breakfast at lunch time lunch at dinner time and dinner late at night.",

            "answer": "Have dinner early and go for a walk, I've gahad 3 GTT this pregnancy, failed the first and passed the second two but I know I have GD, my sugars are over 10 at night 2 hrs after dinner. My mum had GD and she said eat early and go for a walk, bcos we r busy during the day and using energy your sugars are good, at night we eat then sit around or go to bed and that's why it stays high... Also less carbs more protein and smaller meals more often",

    "question": "Well I have gestational diabetes and my levels were fine the first couple days but now they are screwey. It seems no matter what I eat my sugar spikes up at night. I talked to a diabetes counselor at the hospital and she told me how to help it and I'm following it but it still spikes at night. It's so frustrating. So my question is, until I can get an actual face to face appointment with the diabetes counselor or see my Obgyn, could I just keep doing what I'm doing (which is what I'm suppose to be doing) and if my sugar spikes just bring it down by drinking water and walking around the house for a few minutes? That's what they told me to do if my sugar is high. So I have been doing that to bring my sugar down but do you guys think it's still an affective way to control my sugar levels? It's just super irritating that I eat what I'm suppose to and my sugar won't cooperate. And it only seems to do it at night. I really hope I don't have to use insulin....thanks in advance",
