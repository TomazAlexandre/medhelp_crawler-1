            "answer": "Hello,Tingling sensation of the penis can be due to anxiety, contact dermatitis, traumatic damage to the nerves of penis, diabetes, prostatitis, genital herpes, urethritis and STD\u2019s like Gonorrhea and Syphilis but they are less likely in your case.I would suggest you to keep the area clean and wear cotton underwears. Also apply a mild steroid cream on the penis. If the symptoms persist then the above said conditions have to be ruled out. Please consult a urologist in that case.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "Hello,In genital herpes, pain, burning, tingling, or itching occurs at the infection site before the sores appear. Then clusters of blisters erupt which break down. So if there is no appearance of blisters, it is unlikely to be due to herpes.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
