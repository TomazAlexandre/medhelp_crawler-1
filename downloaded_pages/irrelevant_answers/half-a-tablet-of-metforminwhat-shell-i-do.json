            "answer": "People starting off at 250 mg [half a tablet] of Metformin have a very good chances of eliminating the drug from their lifestyle. That is your dose, right? A half a tablet also means 425 mg or 500 mg. At this level it is a little more difficult to reverse the condition.You left out the part of maintaining proper body weight. Along with sticking to a diabetic diet/nutrition plan, and daily physical exercise being overweight contributes greatly to diabetes. Keep your cholesterol, triglycerides and blood pressure at normal levels too. Doing all helps lower and maintain proper glucose levels.Purchase a reputable home glucose test meter, test before each meal [preprandial] - to get a baseline measurement. Then test 2-3 hrs after each meal [postprandial] - to see how the foods you consumed affected your glucose levels. Post back if you don't know the acceptable ranges or read other threads on this forum as it has been mentioned quite often. Good luck",
