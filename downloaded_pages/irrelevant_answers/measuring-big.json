    "question": "I went to the doctor today and I'm 34+3 days. I'm measuring 39 weeks. I go back in 3 weeks to have an ultrasound to see if either she is big or if I'm retaining a lot of fluid. If she is big, then the doctor said he will induce me. I don't want to be induced but I don't want to deliver a 10 or 11 pound baby either. I've had 3 children and my biggest was 7pounds 12 ounces. Has anyone else measured big but their baby wasn't big? It's scary to know that I'm due 11/11 but she may be here in 3 weeks. I'm not ready lol",
