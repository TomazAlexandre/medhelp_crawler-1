            "answer": "My response....-What are three words you think of when you think of diabetes?Sugar, glucose, disease-What kind of monitor do you use?J&J Ultra MiniWhat are your favorite and least favorite things about it?Gives an indication of my glucose rangeHaving to lancet my finger to get a drop of blood-How often do you test your glucose levels?Rarely. Maybe once every 2-3 weeks. I know what foods cause my glucose to rise. I avoid them. Sometimes after eating at a restaurant cuz I suspect they added sugar even when asked not to.Do you test in public?NoWhy or why not?Its not normal and shouldn't press how you feel upon others who may be bothered by it. Do U pick boogers out of your nose in a public restaurant in plain view of others sitting next to you? Reach down your pants and scratch your scrotum on the sidewalk? What's the difference? Its\u00a0\u00a0not hard to remove oneself from public view, especially from view of children who may take your actions in the wrong way.-Does diabetes affect your social life? How?Not at all. Why should it?-Do you carry diabetes supplies with you (monitor, medication, etc.)Only when traveling further than 100 miles from homeWhat do you carry? Where?My J&J test kit and insulin. On vacation, on a business trip....if there's is anything else you'd like to add, I'd love to hear it (how diabetes makes you feel, how you're doing right now, anything you'd like to talk about.)I am medicinally induced. My immunosuppressant\u00a0\u00a0medication [Prograf] made me diabetic in 2004. One has to change their lifestyle accordingly; give up bad foods and bad liquids, maintain proper weight, and exercise daily. Its simple but most people are too lazy to do these simple adjustments so their diabetes gets jacked. Diabetes T2 is progressive as long as one lets it become progressive. Go to the T2 forum next door and read the posts. Many are new and yet those who have T2 still don't know what to do. As Americans get fatter and more obese eating man made junk food, we'll continue to see a rise in diagnosed diabetes.Do yourself a favor and attend a diabetes education class held at your local hospital. Usually free.",

    "question": "Hi guys,I'm a product design student at Art Center College of design and I'm focusing on diabetes care for my final project (mainly glucose monitors, but I'm open to other things as well.) In the past month, both my dad and my grandmother were diagnosed with Type 2 and I was warned I may be at risk too. I want to do everything I can to learn more about diabetes (T1 and T2) and how it affects your daily life, emotions, etc.If you would like to help me on this project, here are some questions I'd like to hear more about. Answer as much or as little as you'd like. Anything helps. Also, if you don't want to post everything to the public, just shoot me a message.
