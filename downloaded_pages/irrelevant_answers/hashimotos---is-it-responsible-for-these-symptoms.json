    "question": "In 2004 I had Pero Ab > 70.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's and was put on Synthroid.\u00a0\u00a0After getting to 50mcg I felt amazingly better.\u00a0\u00a0I did not know how bad I was feeling.\u00a0\u00a0All was going well until last summer.\u00a0\u00a0I began to get the following symptoms:Inability to regulate my body temperature.\u00a0\u00a0I would stay hot much longer than normal or cold much longer than normal.I got keratosis pilaris and they were perpetually aggrivated and painful (I am told they are usually benign)My skin is dry, but my scalp is oilyI have brain fog - I am forgetting much more frequently and can be at a lose for words.I have fatigue & weight gain.Are these symptoms all from Hashimoto's?My endocrinologist tested the whole thyroid panel and the only remarkable number was pero ab >1000.\u00a0\u00a0 She said to increase my dose until my TSH is under 3. (TSH - 4.14)\u00a0\u00a0She also said that there is not much else we can do while my thyroid is sputtering.\u00a0\u00a0 When my thyroid dies Synthroid replacement will be sufficient and my symptoms will abate.Have you heard of this?How long does it take a thyroid to die?Thanks!Tutta",
