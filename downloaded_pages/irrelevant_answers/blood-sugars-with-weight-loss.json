My evening levels can be from 115-150. The morning glucose when I first awake can go from 160-300. I take Metformin twice a day max dose of 1000 mg. I test twice a day. I had an A1c and don't recall the result score only that it was elevated enough to have to double my medication from the three months before. Does this help satisfy the question?",

Diabetes is a progressive disease and the rapidity of its development can be slowed and in some cases almost stopped by appropriate diet, exercise, medications and stress reduction.You need to make another appointment with your health care provider and ask about the #1 & #2 questions posed by WaveRider. In other words get more informed about your specific type of diabetes. Again, get educated about your medical condition.Stay in touch,troytroy",

We here to help and will try to point you in the right direction but only if you let us.Your morning glucose levels are dangerously high and point directly to my clues. You need to discuss them with an Endocrinologist as the regimen you're currently on is not working. He/she may not know or understand LADA as its a relatively new diagnosis. Go here for discussions on LADA\u00a0\u00a0http://tinyurl.com/aboutlada . Many were in the same boat as you yet have their glucose levels now under control.

            "answer": "Thank you for all this information. Yes, I go to a learning hospital that trains Baylor and Texas A&M but yet haven't received this advice. I will make a point to see an endocrinologist as we have every type of specialist you can imagine here. I am having a harder time waking up every morning and more slow and confused than ever and is taking over an hr. to get oriented well enough to do business or go somewhere.I have only had gestational diabetes before which goes away after pregnancies. My father and his family had a lot of diabetic members. I assumed losing wt. would get rid of it but I am wrong. I plan on continuing to lose wt., right now between 82-84 lb. loss but will continue the short trip to get the rest off. I have depleted my diet of caffeine, sodas, only drink water now, have always been complete vegetarian so no meats, fowl, fish, eggs, oil, cheese, etc.I can do all these daily exercises Hava except the mandukasan due to bilateral total knee replacements which leave me unable to be on my knees. I am overwelmed by all the great and new advice. I am off to make an appt. Thanks so much.Judith",

            "answer": "You don't say how long you have been diagnosed with Type II. Diabetes, is, unfortunately, a progressive disease. If it has been several years, your body may no longer be making enough of its own insulin and you may now need to take external insulin. It doesn't mean you've failed to manage your diabetes it's just the nature of the disease.If, on the other hand, you have not been diagnosed that long (say 3-4 years or less), you might be one of the 15-30% of Diabetics who are misdiagnosed and are in fact, as Waverider mentioned, LADA/1.5 (I am). The DP is not necessarily indicative of LADA as it indicates Insulin Resistance which is a Type 2 characteristic (though some Type 1's and 1.5's have it too), but needing insulin after a shorter period of time, being normal weight or lower, and having another autoimmune disease such as thyroid ARE signs you should be checked for your true Type.",

Another thing to research if it's right for you and if you do not have heart issues is Iodine. My husband takes an Iodine supplement every day.\u00a0\u00a0It's helped him soooooo\u00a0\u00a0much. Helped his leg pain/restlessness, sleep, and though he's never had a weight issue it helps regulate even lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0The owner of a health food store I've been going to for 17 years recommended Iodine for diabetes. He said there have been dramatic results for diabetes patients adding Iodine to their regime.\u00a0\u00a0I take it too, woman need it to prevent breast cancer and other things. That and Vitamin D help a lot.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck.",

I had a heart attack 3 yrs. ago (mild) so will find out about the iodine. I suffered my first diabetic episode in public this week and was so embarassed. Now my purse is fully loaded for any time as I got caught out too long and waiting in a long line for two and a half hours and went down. I love my health food store here too. It is small and private and not one of the big chains. If you want it and they don't carry it, they will order it for you. They are so knowledgeable about everything.",

I lose the better I feel, the further I walk every day now, and I just started tai chi lessons. However, I am sad it hasn't made a difference in my blood sugars and went down in public for the first time which was so embarassing. I have made an appt. for after the holiday and am seeing two endocrinologists at a workshop at my hospital this Friday for diabetes. I am excited about all the info. I got on here and will be taking with me to ask plenty of questions. It's nice to be going down a different path then the one I have been pursuing over and over. I am worried with my family history that this may not go away like it did after my pregnancies.Thanks for taking the time to talk to me. I see you live in Texas as well.J",
