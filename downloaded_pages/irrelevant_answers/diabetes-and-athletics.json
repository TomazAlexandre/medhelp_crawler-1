If you are predisposed to developing type 1 diabetes, no amount of exercise will change this.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, type 2 diabetes is linked with obesity, and exercise would definitely help with the prevention of that type.\u00a0\u00a0The hemoglobin A1C measures the average blood sugar level over a 3 month time period.\u00a0\u00a0This test is used by diabetics as a tool in keeping their blood glucose readings in control.",

    "question": "Would jogging and running (at 80-84% mhr) 60 minutes a day six times a week increase the sugar level(in person who has normal fasting <105 glucose) and is there a risk of 46 year old male developing\u00a0\u00a0diabetes in the future as result of exercising very hard at the above FIT level?Should person exercise at lower intensity(even though he can exercise at higher intensity) for prevention of developing diabetes in the future? Is there equation of calculating normal average glucose from hemoglobin a1c test?Thanks",
