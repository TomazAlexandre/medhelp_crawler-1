            "answer": "This could be a age related problem. I am 50 and I have the same issues that were not there a few years ago. I've heard that men app. my age need direct stimulation to maintain their erections.\u00a0\u00a0I personally have an issue with my penis going soft while in side my partner and also the inability to ejaculate with my partner. This is new also for me within the last few years. However, I do not have a problem with ejaculating during masturbation if I am doing the masturbation. So, I sympathize with you,but I do not have a solution except that you may want to look into Viagra or similar drugs. With these drugs I can maintain the erection, though they do not help with the lack of ejaculation problem.",

            "answer": "Hi,If it\u2019s remaining erect on direct stimulation, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much to be worried about. I\u2019ll suggest getting your blood pressure checked and also blood sugar to rule out the possibility of hypertension and diabetes as these are 2 common culprits in causing the erectile problems. However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any serious problem and you can always ask your partner to directly stimulate your penis and then you can have sexual intercourse. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
