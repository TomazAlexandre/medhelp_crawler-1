            "answer": "Hi there. The various causes for a painful and tingling great toe could be a bad pair of shoes, compression of a nerve like by shoes hurting the toe for very long, and due to toe injury, gout due to high uric acid levels, diabetes, inflamed bone on the underside of the toe due to arthritis or a part of the bone hitting a nerve in the big toe, bunions or bumps at the base of the big toe, peripheral neuropathy in diabetes and smokers, and cervical spondylosis causing nerve compression in the back. You need to consult a neurologist who would examine you in detail and conduct various relevant tests including blood tests, MRI spine etc to find the cause and treat it. Take care.",
