            "answer": "Hi!Iron deficiency is the commonest cause of hair loss. Iron deficiency can be due to poor intake or poor absorption or due to hidden loss from bleeding as is seen in UTI and gut problems like IBS. The cause of anemia has to be found out by various blood tests. Iron replacement along with diet rich in iron and hemoglobin should be given. Please consult a hematologist if iron deficiency is detected. Hair loss can also be due to dandruff, dermatitis, shampoos, oils, soaps, dust and dirt etc. Thyroid disorders and diabetes too could be a cause. Insomnia, stress and anxiety along with poor diet and excess of caffeine too can be the cause.\u00a0\u00a0Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

    "question": "I have chronic telogen effluvium.\u00a0\u00a0I also have Sjogren's Syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0My hair falls out and grows back - the problem is the growth phase never reaches any fullness before the fall out starts again.\u00a0\u00a0I am taking Plaquenil and vitamin supplements - D, biotin, multivitamin and fish oil.\u00a0\u00a0I also take Moducare.\u00a0\u00a0This was going on a number of years before I started Plaquenil and so I don't think it is the culprit. My dermatologist has no answer.\u00a0\u00a0Have you any ideas?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
