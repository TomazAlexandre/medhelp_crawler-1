            "answer": "Dear Wade:Sorry to hear about your parasthesias.\u00a0\u00a0From what you tell me I would put MS down the list of possibilities.\u00a0\u00a0There are a couple of things your telling me that makes it less likely.\u00a0\u00a0The length of time that this has been occurring without other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0The symmetry of the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0The intensification with alcohol (since your allergic to yeast and yeast is used to make beer).\u00a0\u00a0I think you need to keep your neurological appointment.\u00a0\u00a0MS can present this way and we have seen it present like you describe but usually it is asymmetric.\u00a0\u00a0There is usually some muscle weakness or changes picked up on examination, especially since the symptoms are so frequent.Many different things can cause parasthesias.\u00a0\u00a0Chronic alcohol use, diabetes, allergic reactions, vascular diseases, hypocalcemia, thyroid problems, etc.\u00a0\u00a0The neurologist will likely think about all these things as you are going through the history and examination.I hope that it is something simple like the yeast allergy.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

            "answer": "Sorry to hear about your symptoms Wade. I have been diagnosed with MS for 10 years and have had some tingling in my left foot and lower left leg.\u00a0\u00a0I jumped on here to try to figure out if what I am experiencing now is MS or a pinched nerve or something.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had a bout of ON during September and fell and dislocated my right shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0I have slowly recovered.\u00a0\u00a0In the middle of December I began experiencing a kink in my back between my shoulder blades.\u00a0\u00a0By the weeks end my ring finger and my pinky on both of my hands became slightly numb and I find myself dropping things.\u00a0\u00a0The more I use my hands the more numb they become.\u00a0\u00a0When I bend my head over I feel tingling in the bottom of my feet.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think it is Lhermitten's because I have had that feeling before and it ran down my back.\u00a0\u00a0I also noticed that my right arm feels cold at times and now my right leg gets a burning sensation similar to other MS symptoms I have had.If any one has had these symptoms let me know what you did for them.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have direct access to a neurologist and have to go through a GP first.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure what to do. Could there be a problem from my fall on my right shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor did tell me if I felt numb in the arm to call him, but I have this in both arms.\u00a0\u00a0What should I do?",

    "question": "For the last 6 months I have been having some tingling in my feet. Not pins & needles, but more of a buzzing and twinging on the bottom sides. I have also noticed this feeling intermittently in the fleshy part on my hands (between the wrist & finger). I can usually make the feeling go away just by moving them. The feeling is not pins & needles. There is no numbess and no noticble muscle weakness.Over the last 3 weeks (tis the season) I have noticed that when I drink alcohol my hands & feet turn beat red and begin to throb. They feel very hot and the throbbing is incredible. The next day the tingling feels worse. I have an allergy to yeast (degree 3) which has never before bothered me. I am wondering if the two could be related.Before I noticed that alcohol had been affecting me-my GP referred me to a neurologist whom I am due to vist in 3 weeks. He was concerned that this might be MS. The feeling in both feet is identical and the throbbing is in all 4 of my limbs uniformly. Any ideas? Could there be a connection? Would MS affect this uniformly?Thanks for any help you can provide.",
