            "answer": "I am not a doctor but there absolutely has to be a medication that you could take that does not cause weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0What about wellbutrin? Also, if you are still on prozac and that is working could they maybe up your dossage on that?\u00a0\u00a0 I keep on hearing good things about wellbutrin.\u00a0\u00a0Talk to your doctor and ask for some suggestions and then before taking them, you can always research online to see what the side effects are.\u00a0\u00a0 I personally think that your mental health is as important as your physical health.\u00a0\u00a0If you are feeling very depressed and your off medication, is it really worth sacrificing everything just to lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0I know there has to be a balence.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure right now that you are getting some kind of physical activity.\u00a0\u00a0Even if you are not that big of a work out person.\u00a0\u00a0I find for me that physical activity makes me feel better. I am sure you probably know that.\u00a0\u00a0I just know how it feels to be really low, it is the worse feeling in the world.\u00a0\u00a0 Again I am not a doctor but please take care of yourself and just know that everything will get better.",

            "answer": "I just wanted to encourage you in your quest to loose weight and find an anti-depressant that will at least be weight neutral.\u00a0\u00a0I have Prozac to be pretty good at being weight neutral.\u00a0\u00a0I also started using some whole food supplements by GNLD that are really good and can tell a difference, where other vitamins have not helped before.\u00a0\u00a0They have products that help you maintain the correct blood surgar levels without interfering with your current medications.I agree with melnam on getting some physical activity and I used to be an exercise nut, but with some job injuries I have found that difficult to do.\u00a0\u00a0I have just tried to walk and bicycle which I have found to be very helpful but not overwhelming.\u00a0\u00a0A little Yoga has helped.\u00a0\u00a0I do understand at times that it is just very hard to get up and do anything.\u00a0\u00a0I have days where I can barely move and days when I am better, rolling the punches has become a survival tool.\u00a0\u00a0Take care and good luck.",
