            "answer": "I was told that rapid weight loss (10% or more of your body weight) within a month can be either a sign of cancer or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0With your tiredness, it could very well be diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Have you had your blood checked for that?\u00a0\u00a0I am not a doctor or nurse, this is just what I have been told about rapid weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0My sister passed away May 13, 2009 from Stage IV rectal cancer so anytime I hear of anyone that has rectal bleeding, I would strongly encourage them to have a colonoscopy.\u00a0\u00a0Had my sister done that, it would have been caught early and she would still be alive.",
