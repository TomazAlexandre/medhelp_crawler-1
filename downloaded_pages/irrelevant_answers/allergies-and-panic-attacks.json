            "answer": "Hello,Panic attack can be triggered by difficulty in breathing caused by allergies in your case. During a panic attack, breathe slowly through the nose using the diaphragm and abdomen. Do not breathe through the mouth. Talk with a supportive person if you are feeling stressed or anxious. Also get yourself evaluated for diabetes, thyroid disorders and heart valve disorders. Also take vit B supplements for some days. It might help.If the symptoms persist then please consult a physician. You may need anti anxiety medicines.Severe cases may require Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
