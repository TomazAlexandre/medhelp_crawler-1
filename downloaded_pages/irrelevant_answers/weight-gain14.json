            "answer": "It really depends on your prepregnancy weight and your dr. First baby I was 198lbs and gained 37lbs and no one said a word and I lost it all without hardly trying. This baby, back to 198lbs, I'm 21wks and gained only 13lbs so far and my dr doesn't care but the hospital says that's too much and that I should only gain 20lbs all up.",

Gaining too much can put you at risk for gestational diabetes, but if your doc/midwife isn't concerned than you're probably okay.\u00a0\u00a0Just aim to make healthy choices, you really only need about 300 extra calories daily when pregnant.",
