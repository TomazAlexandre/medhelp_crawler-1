            "answer": "Same thing has happen to me before.\u00a0\u00a0Do you sit alot during the day?\u00a0\u00a0At times if you sit alot your nerves in your left testicle can compress, which would cause the tingle feeling.\u00a0\u00a0Wear loose clothes and wear loose boxers no BRIEFS.... You want both testicles to be loose during the day.... If you wear briefs if will cause more pressure to both testicles.\u00a0\u00a0remember the testicles are made to hang so when you sit they climb up, but if you wear briefs they are already up, which means your applying alot of pressure.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps....",
