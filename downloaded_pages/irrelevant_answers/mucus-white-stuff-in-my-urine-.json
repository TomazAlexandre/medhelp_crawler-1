            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!It can be bladder debris. Parasitic infections like schistosomiasis and filariasis can result in worms in urine which appear as fleshy substances. Fungal infections like candidiasis too cause fleshy substance in urine. Bladder cancer, polyps and stones are other reasons.Pea sized lump in the neck could be a lymph node, a cyst or a neurofibroma (benign collection of nerve and fibrous tissue). It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult an urologist and your PCP for this. Collect the urine sample with fleshy /mucus substance in it and get it examined at a lab. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
