            "answer": "This is a testimonial review on Magnesium Taurate from an online website:\"People, I can't say enough good things about this magnesium taurate. .... My personal experience is that PMS, hormone shifts, temporary bouts of weepiness, are all but eliminated within minutes of my taking but one of these things. I am not very deficient in mg, but I take them 3 days before menstruation and it helps prevent problems too. I also get a very \"Prozac-like\" after effect the next day. I feel like getting up earlier, doing things I have been putting off, and I am even less achy!Stress depletes the body of mg, and mg deficiency causes depression as well as other mental illnesses, heart disease, and complications from diabetes.\"",

    "question": "I was wondering 2 weeks before my period I get in moods where i almost feel depressed. I just want to **** my self in my room. I go to work and do other things in my life, but inside i feel worthless. I don't tell anyone. I just keep it inside. I have other effects like back pains, so I am not sure if its just bad PMS or depression?",
