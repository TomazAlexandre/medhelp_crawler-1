            "answer": "I can't speak on cranial issues only diabetes. Your father is a diabetic and there is no turning back, only control - the insulin. Control helps bring glucose levels back to normal. Two factors that play heavily in diabetes control are moderate exercise and diet. Exercise helps burn off excess glucose. Can you father sit upright? If so, rig up a rope and pulley system so that he can move his arms in a push and pull method. Anything to flex his muscles and circulate blood helps. Being bed ridden, you can help control his diabetes with a proper diet. As far as supplements and/or homeopathic medicine curing diabetes, there are none. NO medical papers and NO clinical test trials proving supplements can eliminate diabetes. I do find that cinnamon helps me regulate not only my glucose but also my blood pressure. Medicine first said 1/4 tsp daily now its 1/2 tsp. So the jury is still out on that one. Don't get me wrong, I believe homeopathic medicine has its own rights in medicine, just not here, yet. Bear in mind there are a lot of quacks out there touting cures but only after you spent your hard earned $$ does one realize its a scam.",

            "answer": "I can understand how your father may get tired walking to/from the bathroom but he must continue to do so to maintain his strength. Don't let him get lazy.All diabetic equipment - syringes, insulin, test meters and lancets - are permitted as carry on items on an airline. When traveling, I carry them in a separate insulated lunch bag. Its not only easier for airline security to determine what they are but also for you by keeping everything together.It's best to discuss with your father's doctor how to regulate his insulin when traveling over multiple time zones. You also can post this question to Dr Ramsetty on the Ask the Doctor Forum, next door. Be sure to include his dosage and times when his shots are administered. Other forum members may come along and post their experiences too.",
