            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0She needs to do this NOW before the addiction gets any worse.\u00a0\u00a0I was up to around 30 or more of those 10mg a day and right now I'm in rehab.\u00a0\u00a0You need to get her Clonidine for the withdrawl symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Thats what they give you in rehab.\u00a0\u00a0Its only a blood pressure medication but has be found to also relieve symptoms of opiate WD's.\u00a0\u00a0I'm telling you I tried to detox from the pain pills at home MANY times and failed every time.\u00a0\u00a0The WD's are HORRIBLE.\u00a0\u00a0But the clonidine I was givin here helped me by 80%.\u00a0\u00a0You should have her go to a Dr. and let him know whats going on, they should prescribe them to you.\u00a0\u00a0I was taking them for about a week.\u00a0\u00a0I'm off them now.\u00a0\u00a0The only side effects I had from the clonidine was dry mouth, got very drousy (but that helped me sleep, which you cant do during withdrawls) and they can make you dizzy if you stand up too fast.\u00a0\u00a0Along with clonidine, I was given Immodium for upset stomach (NEED THAT), Ibruprofen for aches, and a multivitamin.Good luck. Go for it.\u00a0\u00a0Let me know if you have any questions!! :)-Joostin",

            "answer": "I am currently on day 1 of a very long addiction to lortab taking about 200-250 milligrams a day. Im still going through the severe aches from about mid torso down. Feels like charlie horses in both my legs, my stomach is in a really tight painful knot, and my lower back is absolutely killing me. Nothing has helped so far, I just lay here on the couch and deal with it, shaking or bouncing my legs while laying down takes some of the painful tingle out of them so I do that until I get so tired I finally just pass out from exhaustion. This is my 5th attempt to detox at home just white knuckling it. Hang in there everyone and Ill be praying along with you.",
