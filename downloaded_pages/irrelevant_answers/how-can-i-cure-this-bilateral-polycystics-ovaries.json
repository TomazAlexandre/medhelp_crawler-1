            "answer": "Unfortunately, there is no cure for it, but it is treatable. Women that have PCOS have low levels of progesterone which in turn causes miscarriages. If left untreated, it may lead to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and possibly cancer.\u00a0\u00a0But it's not uncommon and it can be treated. Make sure you see your doctor for appropriate treatment. There is medication to help you ovulate and regulate your periods. When the time comes that you want to conceive, let your doctor know that you want progesterone supplements and take your prenatal vitamins before you start trying to conceive to better prepare your body. I'm sorry that you're going through this, but don't stress too much over it. Stress affects your cycles too. Good luck :)",

            "answer": "It could possibly take more than just progesterone to prevent miscarriage.\u00a0\u00a0In women with PCOS (which by the way usually does affect both ovaries), your insulin levels and blood sugars can be too high (this isn't the case for all women, but it's certainly something that should be checked into if they haven't done so already).\u00a0\u00a0If insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, or gestational diabetes are left untreated both the mother and the fetus are at risk for medical problems (early on miscarriages and miscarriages happening as late as 5-6 months into the pregnancy being two of those risks).\u00a0\u00a0There are medication options to address the insulin and blood sugar issues if they do occur before, during, or after pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0It's important to understand that for many women, PCOS is more than just a problem with low progesterone levels, it can be very complex and needs to be monitored.\u00a0\u00a0I would llike to reiterate what babypooh said...it's definitely manageable, but not curable.",
