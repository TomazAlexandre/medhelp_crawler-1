            "answer": "Hi,Skin tags are very common soft harmless lesions that appear to hang off the skin. They\u00a0\u00a0develop in both men and women as they grow older and most often found in the skin folds (neck, armpits, groin). They also tend to be more numerous in obese persons and in those with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.Skin tags are made up of loosely arranged collagen fibers and blood vessels surrounded by a thickened or thinned-out epidermis.\u00a0\u00a0The cause is not clear but is associated with : irritation from skin rubbing together; high levels of growth factors, particularly during pregnancy or in acrogmegaly; insulin resistance; or human papilloma virus.\u00a0\u00a0Skin tags can be removed for cosmetic reasons by:\u00a0\u00a0cryotherapy , surgical excision, electrosurgery\u00a0\u00a0or ligation.Take care and regards.",
