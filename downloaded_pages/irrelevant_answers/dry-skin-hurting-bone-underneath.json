            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Transient numbness or absence of sensation are common, but chronic or prolonged symptoms can be caused by a problem with the functioning of neurons in the nerves. In older individuals, this symptom or also called paresthesia is often the result of poor circulation in the limbs such as in peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy, vitamin deficiency and malnutrition, as well as metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. Leprosy and other skin conditions must also be ruled out.\u00a0\u00a0It is best that your uncle see his attending physician for proper evaluation. Direct clinical examination and diagnostic tests are important. Take care and regards.",
