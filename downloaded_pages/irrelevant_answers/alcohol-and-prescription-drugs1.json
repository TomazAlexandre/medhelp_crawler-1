            "answer": "Dear Worried and Upset,I believe your analysis of the situation is correct. If your husband continues to behave as you have described, he could die at any time from a number of causes:1. Combining alcohol and Xanax can kill by depressing the breathing centers of the central nervous system - he could fall asleep and stop breathing.2. Combining alcohol and diabetic medications could cause him to develop low blood sugar while passed out from the Xanax and alcohol. Low blood sugar can lead to seizures and death.Even if your husband does not die, the following may happen:1. Drinking will tend to raise his blood pressure, and he already has a blood pressure problem.2. In some diabetics, even moderate drinking (more than two drinks a week) causes nerve and/or eye damage.3. Heavy drinking can hurt the liver which will make diabetes more difficult to manage.4. Drinking adds empty calories which will Imake his weight problem and his diabetes worse.No one can tell you for certain what that combination of medications acting in combination with alcohol will do because no one tests for it.The American Diabetes Association web site at www.diabetes.org has additional information on alcohol and diabetes.If your husband doesn't want to stop drinking there is not much you can do except go to Alanon to get support for yourself.Good luck to you and your husband.",

            "answer": "While I must say that taking Xanax and also consuming alcohol can be dangerous, I also must add that in most, (Not all cases) Combining Xanax with alcohol is \"ususally\" only deadly when mixed in high doses. Problem is that too high of a dose often depends on the person. Regardless, Xanax should only be taken for short term periods and should never be used as a maintenence drug. It can be VERY addictive and the longer you take it the more you need to get the same effect.Your husband is probably suffering from undiagnosed and untreated clinical depression. He is trying to self medicate to ease the symptoms. There are other ways and other meds to control depression and anxiety that are much more effective and safer.Unfortunatly your husband must first admit he has a mental illness. Then he can accept proper treatment and get his life back on track. You can't make someone get help. They have to want help first.",

            "answer": "I am so sorry to read about your situation. I'm sure that your husband is quite unhappy, and like most men, do not like feeling helpless and not in control. Diabetes is a frustrating disease, particularly for men, because they can feel quite helpless after they receive the diagnosis.I'm sure that he does not like your \"nagging\", but I understand that you care deeply for him and want to help keep him safe. One thing that you can do for yourself is consider getting involved in Alanon. This outlet may offer you some techniques, both for yourself, and possibly ways to improve your situation.The combination of the xanax, alcohol, high blood pressure, and\u00a0\u00a0diabetes is a very tricky one. When you also factor in an allergy med, who knows what this drug interaction can result in. He's playing a scary game of Russian roulette and you're being forced to watch.Will he respond to intelligent information if you presented it to him from his physician? What about the pharmacist who fills his prescriptions?Perhaps you can try this route first and see if any of this impacts him.Good luck...I'm sure you must feel like you're carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders....",
