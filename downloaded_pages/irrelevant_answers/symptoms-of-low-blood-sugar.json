            "answer": "\"I get symptoms of my sugar dropping, but when I check my sugar, most of the time it is fine.\"What symptoms? Its hard to say since you didn't mention when you were taking theses readings or what you diet has been. What are you readings when you feel crummy and after \"When I eat something, I feel better within 20 minutes.\" Knowing what these are will assist us better in answering your question.I Google'd your question \"symptoms of low blood sugar\" and received 1,360,000 hits http://tinyurl.com/4kbf7j .

            "answer": "\"My docor says I have \"controlled diabetes\". What she can't explain...\"If she says something and can't explain what she means, one has to wonder if she graduated at the bottom of her medical class. A doctor needs to be able explain all your lab results, or at least refer you to a specialist that can. Sounds like all she's doing is referring your bills to your insurance company to collect her fees.I receive a yearly circulation put out by Consumer Reports that rates doctors in my area by * (stars). One is * low, five *'s high. If you can find such a report my advice is to go seek out another doctor who CAN explain things to you, and is willing to treat you now, and not take a wait and see attitude. At least ask your friends and co-workers for doctor referrals.\"...feeling Im going to pass out.\" This is not a good sign and you need to seek medical assistance ASAP. What if you had this attack and did pass out while driving on the highway at 65 mph? Think of the consequences.",
