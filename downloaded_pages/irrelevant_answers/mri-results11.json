            "answer": "Hi!The MRI does not indicate any apparent cause for left side numbness. Degenerative or wear and tear changes have just started and unlikely to cause any pressure on cord or spinal nerves. The numbness could be due to peripheral neuropathies as seen in diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme\u2019s or lupus. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

There is minimal left foraminal narrowing.L5-S1: There is no disc bulge, herniation, central or foraminal stenosis. There is mild bilateral facetarthropathy.There are a few scattered renal cysts noted.IMPRESSION:Minimal degenerative changes without stenosis or nerve root compression.No evidence of demyelinating disease in the visualized lower cord.",
