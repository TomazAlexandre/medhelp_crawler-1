I'm sure others will have better input.When you hear from the dr., will you let us know what he/she says?\u00a0\u00a0I'm curious.",

    "question": "My 16yr old has a boil or carbuncle that ruptured last night .. it was black inside before it ruptured.\u00a0\u00a0It was about the size of 5-6mm I'd say.\u00a0\u00a0She is prone to styes often, too.My ? .. what causes the black core inside?\u00a0\u00a0I'm going to call the Dr. today as I would think it is obviously infected and being black may need more than \"home treatment\".She is healthy but diabetes runs in the family; will ask for a screening to be certain as the boils now in addition to frequent styes .. she's been screened a few yrs ago and normal.Any thoughts .. you guys know so much about everything I figured I'd post here :)Cheryl",
