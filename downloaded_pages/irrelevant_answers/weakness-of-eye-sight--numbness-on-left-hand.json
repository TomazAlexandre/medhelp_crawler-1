            "answer": "Dear Sebastian, Thank you for your question. It is quite difficult to precisely tell you about the diagnosis without being able to examine you. It seems like that you should consult a doctor for your blood test (especially sugar for diabetes) and neurological assessment. Diabetes in long run is associated with diabetic retinopathy (gradual loss of vision), diabetic neuropathy (numbness in extremities) and sometimes teeth loss. However, few neurological or different medical conditions may relate to few symptoms. Please consult a doctor at your earliest convenience. Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Have they been keeping track of your ferritin (stored iron) levels & circulating iron levels to see if they are low due to blood loss?\u00a0\u00a0Have they tested your calcium level in your blood to see if it is low (re: teeth)?\u00a0\u00a0Also, have they tested your kidney function, as kidneys failing I've heard can also lead to a lot of teeth problems.\u00a0\u00a0Also, do you have acid reflux?\u00a0\u00a0Because that can be hard on teeth.\u00a0\u00a0 Have you seen a neuro-opthamologist regarding your weakening visions and the episodes of glazed vision?\u00a0\u00a0Have you ever had an MRI of your brain?",
