            "answer": "There is a book I recommend it is called sugar blockers, you must take care of your self now and try your best. I wish I would have had that advice when I told I was prediabetic. You know there is something you can start taking now to control it. It is called Mulberry leaf vitamin all natural. Also cinnamon, and there are other natural herbs that can help. If you are over weight it is best to get rid of that extra weight. Here is something I learned from sugar blockers, if you plan on eating a dessert after dinner eat a salad before. You see in sugar blockers it tells you that vegetables when they are digested blow up and suck in any sugars in your body and release it slowly if it is released slowly then you will not get that sugar spike. Diabetes is a disease but for most it is a curse and a nightmare. It will be hard cause now you have to make your food yourself. You can not eat any frozen foods cause everything in the market is loaded with sugars. About the only thing you can do is drink tea, coffee anything you can add your own sugar to. Truvia is a good sugar substitute it comes from a plant not called Stevia, not from man made sugar substitute which has been known to cause cancers in Laboratory rats.",
