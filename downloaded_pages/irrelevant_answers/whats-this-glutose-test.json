            "answer": "They Usually do it somewhere in the 24-28 week range which is why your dr hasn't mentioned it yet. You take a fasting blood test, then drink a sugary syrupy drink they give you, then you wait an hour (my ob clinic has you wait 2) and they check your blood again to see if you have gestational diabetes.",

            "answer": "Yeah I'm with auntie on this one. At my doctors they gave me the drink at my 23w check up and i took it home, kept it in my fridge for 4 weeks then at 27w check up i had to drink the entire drink in 5-10 mins a half hour before my appointment. I went to my doctors they drew my blood in less than 5 mins and then i had my check up and went home was like 30 mins at the most. But every doctor does it differently you can ask you doctor about it next time you go. I'm sure he could explain how he does it. If they give you a choice of which kind you want pick the orange it didn't taste bad at all just like a flat crush drink. (:",
