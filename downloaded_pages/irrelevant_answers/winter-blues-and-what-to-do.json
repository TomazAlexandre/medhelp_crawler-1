            "answer": "Although stress and depression can cause tiredness, there are other medical conditions that can cause this too.Make an appointment to see your doctor and ask him if he can arrange for a blood test to be done to check your iron, Vitamin D and B12 levels.It would also be a good idea to have a blood test taken to check your HBA1C sugar levels or have a glucose test.Iron deficiency can cause anaemia and that can make you feel tired and want to sleep.Having a glucose intolerance or diabetes can also make you feel tired.Make sure that you have a healthy and well balanced diet with lots of fresh fruit and veg and drink plenty of fluids, especially water.\u00a0\u00a02 litres a day is usually recommended, but you may need more if you are working out and sweating.\u00a0\u00a0Dehydration can also make you feel tired.The medication that you are on, can also be causing you to feel tired.Try to do relaxation and breathing exercises to help you with your anxiety issues.\u00a0\u00a0You can also ask your doctor to refer you to a cognitive behavioural counsellor for counselling therapy.May be you should consider cutting down your days at the gym and do 4 sessions a week instead of the 5.\u00a0\u00a0Do something different, like going for a walk, swimming, or just chilling out and listening to some relaxing music.Best wishes.",

    "question": "I am not sure what is going on with me.I am sleeping almost whenever I get the chance. I wake up at 9, get to work for 10 and when I get home at around 630, I take a nap until 8. I then go to bed at around 1.On the weekend, I am sleeping more. I'll take about 2 naps and sleep for about 10 - 12 hours.I'm also feeling quite miserable and not wanting to do anything.I do go to the gym 5 days a week but I find it very hard to push myself to go and when I am there I am miserable.Also, I'm on 10 mg of lexapro. My doctor said that I could go up to 20 mg but was on that amount last year and didn't notice much in terms of how I feel. I'm not on the lexapro for depression but for anxiety (which I'm not feeling).Any suggestions on how to help my sleepiness and poor mood?",
