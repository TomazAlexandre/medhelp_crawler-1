    "question": "Hello,Ive been having a problem with thirst I believe because my mouth is dry.Ive been tested for diabetes which I do not have. This has been going on for about a year. I dont know why this started.Ive also noticed that my gums are starting to recede in the front of my mouth, upper and lower teeth. Im very good about taking care of my teeth. I floss every night and brush three or four times a day. Im a very gentle brusher also.Im concerned about the recession. I dont know what could be causing it. The first time I noticed it was about 6 months ago between my front bottom teeth, it appeared after a dental checkup. Now Im noticing it between more of my teeth.Can someone please give me some advise.",
