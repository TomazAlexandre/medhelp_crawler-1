            "answer": "You can be thin and have PCOS. It appears you just have the cysts, and your hormones are fine. In this case, most of the time the cysts do not clear up on there own, as these are not normal cysts. They are tiny and they surround your eggs, making none of your eggs able to mature enough to be released for ovulation. Birth control might be an option for maybe 3-6 months. Sometimes bc can help with those who have the cysts. And I would say because you are young, you have the time to get onto bc for 3-6 months to try and have your body \"refresh\" itself without further treatment. Also, if your not already on metformin...i do suggest to try and see if your doctor will give that to you, since this can also help improve the cycle.",

            "answer": "Treatment of PCOS depends partially on the woman's stage of life. For younger women who desire birth control, the birth control pill, especially those with low androgenic (male hormone-like) side effects can cause regular periods and prevent the risk of uterine cancer. Another option is intermittent therapy with the hormone progesterone. Progesterone therapy will induce menstrual periods and reduce the risk of uterine cancer, but will not provide contraceptive protection.For acne or excess hair growth, a water pill (diuretic) called spironolactone (Aldactone) may be prescribed to help reverse these problems. The use of spironolactone requires occasional monitoring of blood tests because of its potential effect on the blood potassium levels and kidney function. Eflornithine (Vaniqa) is a cream medication that can be used to slow facial hair growth in women. Electrolysis and over-the-counter depilatory creams are other options for controlling excess hair growth.For women who desire pregnancy, a medication called clomiphene (Clomid) can be used to induce ovulation (cause egg production). In addition, weight loss can normalize menstrual cycles and often increases the possibility of pregnancy in women with PCOS. Other, more aggressive, treatments for infertility (including injection of gonadotropin hormones and assisted reproductive technologies) may also be required in women who desire pregnancy and do not become pregnant on Clomid therapy.Metformin (Glucophage) is a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. This drug affects the action of insulin and is useful in reducing a number of the symptoms and complications of PCOS. Metformin has been shown to be useful in the management of irregular periods, ovulation induction, weight loss, prevention of type 2 diabetes, and prevention of gestational diabetes mellitus in women with PCOS.Obesity that occurs with PCOS needs to be treated because it can cause numerous additional medical problems. The management of obesity in PCOS is similar to the management of obesity in general. Weight loss can help reduce or prevent many of the complications associated with PCOS, including type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Consultation with a dietician on a frequent basis is helpful until just the right individualized program is established for each woman.Finally, a surgical procedure known as ovarian drilling can help induce ovulation in some women who have not responded to other treatments for PCOS. In this procedure a small portion of ovarian tissue is destroyed by an electric current delivered through a needle inserted into the ovary.",

            "answer": "Sometimes birth control CAN clear the cysts up...but it's not always the case. For some women, the cysts go away while on birth control and then when they stop taking it then the cysts come back...this is why PCOS s ucks! You would need to ask your doctor on this. It also depends how many cysts were found on your ovaries (if both of them is affected).",

            "answer": "Hi, bc helps to get rid of cysts by regulating your hormones so if your hormones are normal it WILL NOT help you.\u00a0\u00a0You should see a RE (reproductive endocrinologist) even if you don't want to get pregnant right now.\u00a0\u00a0Metformin is recommended to help resolve your cysts but if you have a lot it will take a long time.\u00a0\u00a0So if you don't want to get pregnant now that would be a good option to start taking it and hopefully when your ready to start trying they will be gone or at least less of them.\u00a0\u00a0If you do want to get pregnant now metformin is still an excellent option because it will help you ovulate.\u00a0\u00a0You should also be put on femara to help ovulate too the combo is great for PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0don't take clomid as it will cause more cysts and thin your lining.\u00a0\u00a0Also if you need to regulate your periods take prometrium not provera, provera is a male form of progesterone and you don't need any more male hormones.\u00a0\u00a0Also if you have a lot of cysts ovarian drilling is a good option I had it done in december of 2009 with phenomenal results.\u00a0\u00a0 good luck hun i hope that helps.",
