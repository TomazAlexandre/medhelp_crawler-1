            "answer": "Well I was like that but try not to have the mentality you are eating for two. You don't want to over do it and you don't want gestational diabetes and you don't want no problems with you baby. I'm not telling you starve yourself but just be careful what you eat. I have four kids with one on the way and with my first child I was working at McDonalds and I had that mentality I was eating for two. I blew up but I was able to stop myself along the way before it got out of hand. I hope this was helpful and congrats on a healthy baby....",
