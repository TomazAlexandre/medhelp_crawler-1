            "answer": "You should go see someone about the incident. Its quite possible they'll want you to have shots as a precautionary measure, given that the animal was sick at the time, and is unavailable for testing.Also, there is no rabies vaccine for skunks. So unlike a dog where the owner could show you proof of vaccination, its not possible here.Rabies can take over a month to manifest, so even if you feel okay now you still could have it.One other note -- tetanus is also a risk, you should have a booster shot for it if applicable.Good luck!",

            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Sign and symptoms of rabies may appear within a few days to a year of a bite. Infected wound could be due to common bacteria of maybe it was not cleaned properly. If you have diabetes then also the wound gets infected.I understand you do not have insurance, but it would be wise to consult your PCP once.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I was bit by a friends domestic 4 yr old skunk last week. ( Indoor pet never been exposed to rabies that I am aware of & they have had it since it was small .) Anyway when this skunk bit me it was sick - ( I was there trying to help nurse my friends pet back to health ) and died later that day. Unsure of cause of death - skunk has now been buried for 1 week - tissue would have decomposed to far for autopsy. I didn't think much of it untill bite wound became infected & now husband is scared that I may have rabies. What are the chances I could have been exposed ? ( don't have the money to pay for shots & no insurance - so would rather not get unless necessary )",
