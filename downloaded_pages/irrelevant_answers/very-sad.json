I had gd in my last pregnancy & it turned out to be a complete blessing, I lost weight and at full term weighed only 1kg more than pre pregnancy, so dropped about 10kg instantly when my super healthy 7pd15oz baby girl was born. The gd was also a great kick in the butt to change my diet and almost straight away I felt so much healthier and less slugish all the time. I'm off for my test for this pregnancy this morning, a little nervous but I'm sure it'll be fine!!",
