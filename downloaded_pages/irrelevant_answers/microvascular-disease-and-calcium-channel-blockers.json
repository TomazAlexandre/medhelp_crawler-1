            "answer": "Hi,Microvascular disease or cardiac small vessel disease is not in your head by all means.\u00a0\u00a0Calcium channel blockers can be very, very effective in helping to treat this (Norvasc & Cardizem CD are quite effective).I think your doctor is doing the right thing by retesting.\u00a0\u00a0ST segment elevation or depression can be signs of some cardiac issues, including coronary artery spasm.There is evidence coming out regarding small vessel disease and women specific coronary artery disease where the vessel walls become thickened themselves...normal caths unless IVUS technology is used won't pick it up--everything will be smooth.You need to quit smoking ASAP.\u00a0\u00a0Small vessel disease will not heal with smoking.I'm 30, and was diagnosed with 3 vessel CAD at 28, and have a stent in my RCA.\u00a0\u00a0I have a very long & severe family history of heart problems.\u00a0\u00a0I have as well been diagnosed with small vessel disease.\u00a0\u00a0Lipid treatment, as well as treating diabetes/insulin resistance is important.\u00a0\u00a0Long acting nitroglycerin is also helpful.SVD can be very dehabilitating.\u00a0\u00a0I had CCS Class IV angina for about a year (strong angina at rest).\u00a0\u00a0It has taken alot of effort by my docs (me), and the meds.\u00a0\u00a0I have gotten better as a result of treatment and a good exercise regimen.I would strongly recommend seeking the advice of preventative and invasive cardiologists at large centers that specialize in small vessel disease--some \"old school\" cardiologists will dismiss it as heart burn or anxiety and be totally wrong.Good luck,Al.",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for your reply.\u00a0\u00a0It is a serious problem that many cardiologists don't seem to acknowledge.\u00a0\u00a0I've been told a thousand times that it's all in my head, it's my nerves, it's acid reflux, it's this, it's that...I'm tired of this.Once again, thank you for taking the time to respond.\u00a0\u00a0It was most informative.",

    "question": "I am a 34 year old female with a strong family history of heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0At 31, I underwent all tests including an coronary angiogram which came back fine.\u00a0\u00a0I have been tested for GERD etc as well (negative). To date, I am still experiencing chest pressure/pain, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness, severe upper back pain (at times) etc.\u00a0\u00a0My cardiologist has now prescribed CCB's instead of betablockers along with nitroglycerin.\u00a0\u00a0In January, he wants to repeat many of the tests that I had underwent a few years back because of a \"questionable\" stress test.\u00a0\u00a0It had something to do with (pardon my ignorance) inconsistencies in the ST waves.\u00a0\u00a0My question(s) to you then are these:\u00a0\u00a0Could something worse be developing unbeknownst to me?\u00a0\u00a0Is this all in my head?\u00a0\u00a0Can microvascular disease of the heart be this debilitating?\u00a0\u00a0Can you explain ST waves in general terms?My blood pressure is on the lower side.\u00a0\u00a0I am 5'5, approximately 140lbs, light smoker, and a non drinker.Please advise.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
