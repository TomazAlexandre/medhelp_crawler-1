            "answer": "Hi,Most of\u00a0\u00a0the GI symptoms you have mentioned are due to obesity.They may not be related to the underlying cause of obesity.The peptic ulcer issue could be due to H.pylori infection (or NSAID in case if you are taking it). Check for this infection and treat it if found positive. Stop NSAID if you are taking it.Post your questions related to obesity in the following forum.http://www.medhelp.org/forums/Weight-Loss--Healthy-Lifestyle/show/360",

    "question": "Hello my name is Babbal I am new to the forum. Ok so here is my issue I weigh 240 lbs absolutely unintentional I cannot lose weight no matter what I consume only about a thousand calories a day not because i starve myself because frankly that is my capacity when a growing male my age needs about 2500. Next I have a very very slow digestive system I have GERD take lansoprazole 30mg twice a day.. After i eat i don't stuff myself I have heaviness and bloating and no amount of exercise can reduce even a pound combined with diet. My thyroid tests diabetes all that was all normal. I am losing my mind I have lack of concentration, fatigue, acanthosis nigricans in all the folds on my body so i have to apply lotions there several times a day because they get dry, have had hemorrhoids for the past three years. Please please suggest me a suggestion I have had an endoscopy normal results and mild chronic peptic duodenitis and nodular gastritis. Please tell me what is wrong with me! I also have lower back pain and extremely slow digestion and vomiting and nausea and high insulin levels. I have many dietary restrictions I can't consume: meat, poultry, eggs, a lot of dairy products, a lot of starches, fried foods spicy foods, sweets, carbonated drinks, peanuts, pineapples and fish.
