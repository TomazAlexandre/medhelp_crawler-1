            "answer": "Good fat lowers triglycerides. It is recommended you consume a moderate fat diet to lower cholesterol and triglycerides. A moderate fat diet means using polyunsaturated (omega 3, corn oil, nuts, etc) fats and monounsaturated (olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil, etc) fats, no saturated fats (high fat snack foods, butter, fat spreads) and no trans fats. So the foods you need to eat are the following: low fat meats (chicken, fish, loin of pork) or non-meat sources (soy products, nuts), low fat vegetarian combinations (rice & beans, pasta & beans, low fat cheese & pasta), low fat and substitute dairy products (1% milk, low fat/fat free yogurts, low fat soy milk/soy yogurt), use plant oils, non trans-fat margarines, and eat a lot of fruits and vegetables and increase daily high fiber breads and cereals (oatmeal). Hoped this helped you.",
