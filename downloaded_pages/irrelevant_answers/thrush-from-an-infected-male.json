            "answer": "Hello, this is obviously worrying you.. sometimes men don't feel any symptoms, or that your symptoms are yet to appear.. I wouldn't start worrying and examining your semen too much, if you do get symptoms you might have like a crusty discharrge around your penis, soreness like you said etc..This has happened with me and my partner before and he didn't have any symptoms either but he went to the doctors anyway and the doc gave him some cream so that we wouldn't be passing it backwards and forwards..The fact that your partner has diabetes makes thrush so much more likely, yeast infections love sugar and tip the ph balance!Hope this helps!",

            "answer": "Thank you for your reply!I am worried, but more for my girlfriend's health, I don't want her overlooking something worse going on inside her by just attributing the root of her outbreak coming from my end. It did really upset me that she was so convinced that she had contracted it from me. However, my girlfriend has gotten a much better understanding from her pharmacist who took the time to explain the tie-in with diabetes & she does happen to have an appointment with her diabetics Dr whom she sees on a regular basis next week. Apparently the (family) Dr she went to was very busy when she went and sounds like he didn't have the time to take to look into it any further and as soon as he heard her say that she had performed oral sex on me he figured bingo, that's where you got it.I have also since found a great site specific to the diagnosis and treatment for men; www.man-yeast-infection.com.",

            "answer": "Glad to hear things are getting sorted now! Like you say, the thrush could be a symptom of her diabetes not being managed properly, so in a way its been a good thing!Hope all ok now",

    "question": "My girlfriend was diagnosed with THRUSH yesterday (of the mouth), several days after performing oral sex on me. Her Dr feels it is possible that it was present in my semen. He said it would be\"milky\". I checked my semen and it seems ok, a translucent slightly off white with a normal consistency. I have no rash, sores etc.,no discomfort, no fever. I am finding very little info on male yeast infections but what I have found says I would be in discomfort and have red spots on my genitals. From what I have read it would seem more likely to me that her diabetes may be a more realistic cause. She is also on various medications and has been under a good deal of stress lately. I have not been with another partner in over 5 yrs and we have been having oral sex now for almost a year. Can anyone guide me to more info on yeast infections in men particularly involving the semen. I don't understand that one at all.",
