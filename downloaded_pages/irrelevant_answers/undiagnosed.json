            "answer": "Welcome. thanks for clarifying about not being a doctor - we would have been asking/wondering!Those darn autoimmune disorders sure can muddy the diagnostic waters - having RA probably influences your doctors' thoughts, somewhat.\u00a0\u00a0It is easy to forget that although we have one major thing wrong with us, such as RA, that doesn't eliminate the possibility of having something else.Much of what you are listing here as your symptoms could be neurological and I agree with your husband\u00a0\u00a0- if I were you I would request a referral to a good neurologist for further evaluationGood luck and please come back with your questions if you think of more.welcome again,Lulu",

            "answer": "Hello and Welcome to the Forum :)I can certainly understand your concerns as they are legitimate ones for sure!Now, I read that you have had blood work and X-Rays but I do not see that you have had any MRI's ...Is that correct?This could be an important tool and of great value. So, Yes, I would get in to see a Neuro as soon as you can for further testing.\u00a0\u00a0Again, I am not a doctor either but do think that your sx need to be investigated and not just pushed off as Anxiety, stress, and / or being a hypochondriac.You know your body better than anyone and what is normal for you and what is not!!!\u00a0\u00a0 Don't let anyone tell you otherwise :)Again Welcome, and look to seeing your post. Come here for question, answers, opinions, rant, or just to share your day\u00a0\u00a0:)Peace,~Tonya",

    "question": "Hello,I am not a doctor (despite my screen name).I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at the age of 13 and have been told that recent symptoms may be related to it, but I am skeptical.\u00a0\u00a0I am in my 20's now and last year developed severe eye pain and dryness and was told after an ultrasound that my retinal nerve was inflamed.\u00a0\u00a0After prednisone treatment it has improved.\u00a0\u00a0But I have since experienced extreme shortness of breath, frequent hiccups, yawning (anything to get oxygen), numbness in hands and feet, fiery pain in heels of my feet, jolting eye movements, dizziness, occasional difficulty speaking and writing my name, I lose my balance in the shower when my eyes are closed (abnormal for me), have difficulty sleeping (mostly because I can't breathe), heart palpitations, and sexual issues/lack of sensation below.\u00a0\u00a0In the last month, I have seen a rheumatologist and a DO whom have both run blood tests and taken x-rays.\u00a0\u00a0Everything is reportedly normal and I was told I have anxiety and was put on celexa.\u00a0\u00a0I have a family history of fibromyalgia and diabetes but these have been ruled out.\u00a0\u00a0My husband suggested I see a neurologist and fears it might be multiple sclerosis.\u00a0\u00a0Should I?\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas as to what this could be?",
