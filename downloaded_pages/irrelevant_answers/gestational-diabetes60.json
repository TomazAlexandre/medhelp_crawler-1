            "answer": "Carb count. Eat every two hours, snack in between meals. Snacks should be about 15-30 carbs, breakfast 30 carbs, lunch 30-45 carbs and dinner 45 carbs. I have been managing it pretty well by not eating a lot of carbs. Stay away from refined sugars. Dont eat cold cereal because thats processed and it turns straight to sugar. A dietician will give you more info.",

            "answer": "Hi. I have gestational diabetes and you gotta look at it as being on a healthy diet. Easy on the carbs, stay away from processed food, back to fresh basics for everything. And easy on the fruit.Another tip I learned is wen eating yoghurt diet yoghurt has a lot less sugar than low fat. I found my sugars easier to control by eating less more often. So I mite have dinner in 2 sittings. Breakfast small bowl of porridge wen I get up, yoghurt and seeds and maybe a few berries later. Make a big bowl of salad for the afternoon and pick on it wen Hungary, or do fresh soup. If you need a carb pick me up in the afternoon slice of bread.",

            "answer": "I have GD and I meet with a nurse about every 2 weeks or so to go over my meal log. They would like me to eat 30-45 grams of carbs for breakfast, 15-30 for snacks in between meals, 45-60 for lunch and 45-60 for dinner. There are a bunch of veggies and some other foods that are considered \"free foods\" meaning they don't spike your blood sugar at all and someone will go over all of that with you. Avoid soda,\u00a0\u00a0cereal, and sweets as they tend to cause a spike. I've been very lucky to not be on insulin and my baby is not big.. actually tiny for being 9 months and I follow this mean plan religiously so that I can have a healthy baby. Good luck to you :)",
