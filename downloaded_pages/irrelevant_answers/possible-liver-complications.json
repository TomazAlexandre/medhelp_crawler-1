            "answer": "I think one of the definitions of alcoholism is drinking when you know it is causing physical harm, so ... I think you are in denial.It sounds like you want somebody to tell you that you can drink for X length of time, and if you stop that day, you won't progress to irreversible liver disease.\u00a0\u00a0Nobody can do that other than to say you already have damage and the time to stop is now since you can't go back in time.\u00a0\u00a0But we can't do it for you.\u00a0\u00a0Only you.\u00a0\u00a0Just like I'm not allowed to eat wheat gluten or I damage myself.",

    "question": "GreetingsI have been diagnosed with fatty liver disease 2 years ago, and a year ago with Diabetes. I'm currently working with a gastroenterologist, which via tests has ruled out any infectious diseases, yet he came to the conclusion it was alcohol related. Until december I was showing improvements on my cholesterol, blood suger levels, yet my LFT was still moderately high.However in December till February stupid me was eating and drinking alcohol again. A week ago I started having these sharp pain under my right ribcage, and a sensation on my right lower abdomen.The pain comes and goes, and it's usually present if I've been sitting for a long time or when I have an empty stomach.I'm not an alcoholic even though my liver problems were caused by alcohol. I've been very stressed out due to my financial problems and I've gained weight back.My questions are: Have my problems gone worse? How long does it take to a fatty liver to progress to alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis?I got a prescription for omeprazol for possible digestive disorders, but I'm gonna take another LFT for my physician to see what's going on.",
