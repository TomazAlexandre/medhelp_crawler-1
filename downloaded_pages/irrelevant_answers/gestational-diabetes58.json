            "answer": "I have it. Mine isnt too bad where i have to take meds or give myself shots but its not as bad as i expected. I have to check my sugar two hours after every meal and once in the morning before i eat anything. But i prtty much eat whatever i want still. Just pirtion control it and if its high in carbs (bread, noodles, etc) eat very small portions of it. It depends on how bad you have it though. My cousin had it and was on meds for itand she didnt have to watch her diet at all with the meds.",

            "answer": "Too much info to post here. You need to have a consultation with your OB, or MFM CRNP , MFM\u00a0\u00a0doc. First, and foremost, you need to be checking your blood sugar levels upon awakening and one hour after meals. If those numbers are high you will need meds (possibly insulin). Additional fetal monitoring and scans for fetal growth are warranted.",
