            "answer": "thx vance for your response. when i did my second test i chose a lab test (well known hospital) which took amount of my blood (small bottle) cause i din want to use a reused finger prick pen tool anymore (NGO test). i shared my experience to her, and she said that dont worry about that tool as long as the needle is new, i doubt about whether it was new or not, but she confirmed me, there's no NGO in this world will use a used needle for finger prick.

            "answer": "What makes you think that the finger prick lancet was reused? Finger prick lancets available today are impossible to reuse. Once used, the device is impossible to be reused.Your symptoms are most probably due to anxiety as are your worries. As Vance said, if you do decide to test again then your anxiety could lead you again to make the conclusion that the needle may have again been reused, hence starting off the cycle again.You had no risk. If this is not enough please seek help in the forum that deals with anxiety.",

            "answer": "Thx for your response OrionB. it was not a single used finger prick lancet, it was a reuse finger prick pen (diabetes finger prick pen which is able to be used for more than once). After my 3 month test, if its negative i will not think about this anymore, cause i will do test in the hospital again not NGO to make sure that everything they use is new. And i hope that all this symptoms are the effect of my anxiety.",
