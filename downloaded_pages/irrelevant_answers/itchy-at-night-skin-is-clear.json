            "answer": "First thing, take a look at anything that has changed. Such as laundry detergents, soaps, dryer pads, food, environment or pets. The possibilities are endless.Next, use a natural soap with no fragrance, use a good moisturizer preferably one designed for eczema. Some people are allergic to so many things that even finding a moisturizer can be a problem. They apply it and get worse. The doctors never explain anything to them, so they start using more, thinking that it's getting dryer, The problem might be they are allergic to a chemical in the moisturizer.Typically when your itchy all over it's a new medication, nerves, stress or dry skin.",

            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin that isn't accompanied by other obvious skin changes, such as a rash, is most often caused by dry skin (xerosis). Dry skin usually results from environmental factors that you can wholly or partially control. These include hot or cold weather with low humidity levels, long-term use of air conditioning or central heating, and washing or bathing too much.Other conditions cause itchy skin as well. Skin conditions like psoriasis,dermatitis,lice,scabies and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Pls take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch.Lastly,Phototherapy can also be tried.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",

    "question": "I am itchy all over, especially at night when I lay down and start to relax. I do not have any rashes or signs of scabies. I do have dry skin on my legs and arms that I am trying to remedy but I don't understand the itching on the rest of me. It makes me miserable at night and my fiancee too because I squirm for the first part of the night and then if I awaken also. Any suggestions??",
