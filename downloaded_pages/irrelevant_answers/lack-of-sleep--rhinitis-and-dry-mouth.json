            "answer": "Hi Lee, sorry to know you are going through a tough time. You have taken much precautions and modified your life style. Have you checked your blood sugar levels and also blood pressure. Are you on any medication. Smoking or chewing tobacco can affect saliva production and aggravate dry mouth. Continuously breathing with your mouth open due to nasal obstruction can also contribute to the problem. Pls continue to drink more liquids and have good ventilation. You can visit a neurophysician once and also get a second ENT opinion. Keep updating. Take care.",

    "question": "I am male and 32 years of age.I can get to sleep fine. But I am being woken between 3am and 6am by dry mouth. I have allergic rhinitis causing nasal congestion (dust, dustmites, mould). However, I can now clear my nose to 75%+ of normal with saltwater (Stermiar). So I'm not even now sure that blocked nose is the problem.I have tried air purifiers (Airfree P60 allergy approved and tested), Amicor allergy resistance quality bedding, new bed, etc. I am not dehydrated. I have a decent diet (but intolerant to tomatoes, apples and spices) so I avoid these.- I drink plenty of water and exercise twice a week (weights).- My room humidity is average 54% which is fine. I keep everything clean, etc.- No diabetes.- Thyroid test came back fine.- No other health issues except mild ADD/ADHD. I can actually get to sleep fine so this is not a problem.My doctor doesn't know what to do. I saw an ENT specialist and they don't know what it is.My life is a misery at the moment, I can't work most days, and as I am self employed, I have no income on those days and I struggle financially. I have also spend a fair amount of money on bedding, etc to try and improve the problem. Not good. I now fear going to bed at night, but I go to sleep at a regular time at night (10:30pm) as I still have hope.Do you have any ideas?Thanks,Lee.",
