            "answer": "Dear KKCAL,After reading all your posts, as friend my advice to you is to go to a good hospital with all your records and take proper treatment for your problems. As I read your posts, you have Diabetes, Hypothyroidism and testicular and probably kidney issues.In case proper medical help is not available at your work place, you need to take leave from your job, come back to India and visit a good hospital like All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi and go back for work after proper treatment. Your problems may be complicated due to change of environment and stress at work place. So, instead of taking your health issues lightly, take immediate action to correct the situation in the right way.Good luck,Solace",
