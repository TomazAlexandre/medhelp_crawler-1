            "answer": "Its not what you think, your baby is bigger than normal which isnt bad but your placenta is probably much bigger than normal do the doc wants to make sure things dont happen too soon. I know my doc measured me after my last ultrasound and my due date changed to be earlier because the placenta and baby are bigger. Its ok nothing to worry about",

    "question": "So last week I had an apt and they said things are good baby was growing and things are great. 2 hours later they called and said they wanted me back in 1 week instead of 2. I didnt think anything about it just thought I hit my every week visits. Went in tonight for what I thought was a normal check up. Instead they wanted to measure me. Im measuring 37 weeks I hit 34 tomorrow. She said there concerned because this has been going on awhile. We know I dont have diabetes, no now I have an ultrasound on tuesday. Has anyone been through this before? Im not ready for an early baby and I dont want a huge baby. Just a little confussed and worried.",
