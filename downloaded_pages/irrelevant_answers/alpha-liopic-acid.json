            "answer": "If your pancreas stopped producing insulin entirely, that means you have Type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0There is no cure for that at this time.\u00a0\u00a0Many of us diabetics take alpha lipoic acid to prevent neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0Also, there is some indication that ALA can help lower your glucose levels.\u00a0\u00a0Although nothing can reverse the destruction of the beta cells in your pancreas, ALA is a very helpful supplement for most diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0I recommend you go to google groups and look for alt.support.diabetes and/or misc.health.diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0They're both excellent groups/forums with people who can provide you with good advice (although be careful of some of the spammers who promote stevia and other useless products - always check out new info with www.quackwatch.com if you have any doubts).",
