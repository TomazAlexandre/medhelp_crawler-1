            "answer": "Hello,What you seem to be having is post inflammatory hyperpigmnetation. The other possibility is of acanthosis nigricans. Topical treatments with acids and chemical peels can be effective but can take a while for the skin to totally revert to its normal color.\u00a0\u00a0Microdermabrasion can also be done, but this might require several sessions.\u00a0\u00a0Skin resurfacing using lasers is also an option.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hello, i am 20 years old female. few years back, i used hair removal cream for my armpits, due to which my armpits are too dark or i should say, they both have dead skin. I feel embarrassed sometimes when i wear sleeveless shirts. I dont know the specific name of my problem but i need the solution. I have used lemon and some creams. But its not working anymore. I also used to do hot waxing and some parlour ladies told me, hot waxing is also the reason of your dark skin or dead armpit skin. Can you please suggest me what should i do? how should i solve this problem. thanks",
