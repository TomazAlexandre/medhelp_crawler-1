            "answer": "Hi,Thyroid hormone imbalance is the most important one which may cause irregular heart beat and changes in BP. Other than this, hormonal imbalances related to the adrenal gland also may cause these problems. As you are currently on Rx for thyroid problem, (Grave's), you may talk to your physician about the adrenal gland.Other than this, please ask your physician to help you space your antihypertensive medications so that drugs are active at most times of the day.BP changes despite your medicinesmay well be corrected if you take care of the above aspects.Regards,",

            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Grave\u2019s disease is an autoimmune disorder. Abnormal beats, atrial flutter and cardiomyopathies all cause similar symptoms. Increased heart rate and blood pressure are normal consequences of Grave\u2019s disease. They need to be controlled properly with medications. However, the results of thyroid function tests do not always correspond to the patient's symptoms. Hence at times an apparently controlled Grave\u2019s disease will have symptoms associated with organs it affects like heart.\u201cIn some patients, Graves disease represents a part of more extensive autoimmune processes leading to dysfunction of multiple organs (eg, autoimmune polyglandular syndromes). Graves disease is associated with pernicious anemia, vitiligo, diabetes mellitus type 1, autoimmune adrenal insufficiency, systemic sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.\u201dI would strongly recommend you to see a heart specialist to adjust the medications. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!Refer: http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/120619-overview",
