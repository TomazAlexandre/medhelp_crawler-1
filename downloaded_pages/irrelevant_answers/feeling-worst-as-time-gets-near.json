            "answer": "I had terrible heart burn, even before pregnancy so you can imagine how bad it got as the pregnancy progressed. I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, forcing me to change my diet, I haven't had ANY heart burn since. I eat a low carb diet filled mostly with lean meats and veggies, some fruit, only thing I drink is water. You could consider revising your diet for the few remaining weeks and see if it helps.",
