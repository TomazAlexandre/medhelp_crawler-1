            "answer": "Weight predictions are very often incredibly inaccurate guesses. Your doctor DOES NOT know for sure how big your baby is - and even if you do have a big baby, your doctor can't possibly know that your body can't deliver him vaginally. My son was 9lbs and I didn't have even the smallest tear - that was two days after he was \"estimated\" at 7-7.5lbs.My suggestion - refuse to schedule a caesarian. You know you can deliver vaginally. Your body knows what to do. Trust yourself. Trust your body. Trust that no midwife in the land would make the suggestion your doctor did and if a midwife can deliver bigger babies then so can doctors. Sometimes you have to stand your ground as the patient. You have the right to refuse. They can't cut you open without your consent. Trust yourself.",

    "question": "I had my first child naturally other than having to be induced. I'm 38 weeks and a few days and my doctor informed me Tuesday that I would have to have a c-section with this one due to him being very large. I do not have gestational diabetes and he is completely healthy other than he's large. Can anybody give me advice on what will/is going to take place. I'm just worried.",
