            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you are a female and in menopausal age group then night sweats are a common occurrence. This can be corrected by hormone replacement therapy. Other causes include AIDS, cancer, infections in the body and side effect of certain drugs. It can also be due to severe acidity with H pylori infection and gastric reflux, hypoglycemia, carcinoid syndromes, hyperthyroidism, and sleep disorders. At times cause cannot be found out. Common cold, sinusitis, ear infection, sensory nerve compression, peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes, inflamed wisdom tooth, impacted wisdom tooth, dental caries, etc\u00a0\u00a0can all cause facial numbness and pain. In your case it could be a combination of infection and maybe acidity, hypoglycemia or thyroid disorders. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
