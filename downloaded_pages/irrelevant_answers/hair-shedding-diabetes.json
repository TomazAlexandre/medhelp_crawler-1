    "question": "Hello I\u2019m a 24 yo Male, I have had type 1 Diabetes for 22 years. Its in good control now my A1C was 6.4 last time it was checked about 6 months ago. My question is I have been noticing more then normal hair loss the last few months. Not in one area but all over, as of now I have no signs of a receding hair line or bald spot. Infect now I have a lot of hair, my hairdresser told me before the I have fine hair but a lot of it (lots of follicles). My Dad has lots of hair too. But now When I run my hand thru my hair ill see anywhere from 1-5 strands of hair in my hand. In the shower I counted (Yes I counted) about 40 -55 strands. Now I know there is a hair growth cycle and in the spring and fall you loss more hair. About 3 months ago I had my Insulin Pump Set wrong and for about a month my readings where really high a lot in the 350-400 range. I have fixed the problem since then , But could that a contributing factor to the hair loss?\u00a0\u00a0I have had no changes In medication or stress levels\u00a0\u00a0in the last year. I have been on a Diet where I Lost about 30lb but its been slow weight loss over a year or so\u2026\u00a0\u00a0So could it be The hair growth cycle,\u00a0\u00a0Balding, Diet, Bad A1C? Or all the above?\u00a0\u00a0Hope you can give me an answer!Thank you for your timeNathan Woys.",
