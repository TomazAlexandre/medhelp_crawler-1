            "answer": "Yes, you can do mostly anything.\u00a0\u00a0HOWEVER...it will not be as easy to do as it is for anybody else you know.\u00a0\u00a0That can be intimidating.\u00a0\u00a0Going to college, school, working, having a family seems so easy for most people who put their mind to it.\u00a0\u00a0But, as a type 1 diabetic, even if you got your mind set on it and your heart in the right place, finding the energy and motivation is a job in itself.I flunked out of college...twice.\u00a0\u00a0I missed too many classes.\u00a0\u00a0Too often I was found laying in my dorm in sweat and misery with high blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, I was probably the last person in America to learn about 9/11.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't wake up until 4pm that day.\u00a0\u00a0My room mate shook me awake and I got up just in time to see World Trade Center 7 come crashing down live on tv.With most critical diseases like cancer or AIDS, group therapy is helpful.\u00a0\u00a0However, I have found with type 1 diabetes that even a veteran diabetic type 1 has little to offer in the way of advice for another.\u00a0\u00a0For no two diabetics go through the same as another.\u00a0\u00a0But I will go on a limp and at least tell you how I've dealt with the issue you address.Not good...!!I've gone through at least twenty different jobs in the past ten years.\u00a0\u00a0Companies only allow a certain amount of sick days.\u00a0\u00a0Less than my health issues demanded.\u00a0\u00a0I was finally put on disability income.\u00a0\u00a0That's an option for you.\u00a0\u00a0If you choose to go that route, make sure you get a lawyer to help you with your claim.\u00a0\u00a0You won't have to pay for his services if you loose the claim.\u00a0\u00a0Disability has really helped with my medical bills that include glucose strips, syringes, insulin, etc, etc because they also put me on Medicare.But you can still work.\u00a0\u00a0I have a job now.\u00a0\u00a0Because of my diabetes, I am unable to work more than twenty or so hours a week.\u00a0\u00a0So thankfully what income I don't get with my hours, I get through my disability income.The most important thing to remember with diabetes type one is to never give up on anything.\u00a0\u00a0Just because working and doing is much easier for other people than it is for us does not make anyone any better than you.\u00a0\u00a0Accept your diabetes and admit and be at peace with the things you have to deal with that are different from other peoples' issues.\u00a0\u00a0And don't get yourself down if you learn that some diabetic type 1 just climbed Mt. Everest but you have a hard time just making it through a normal day.\u00a0\u00a0DIABETES TYPE 1 EFFECTS EVERY SINGLE PERSON DIFFERENTLY.\u00a0\u00a0So do and be what you can.\u00a0\u00a0Very importantly, do what you love.\u00a0\u00a0Your diabetes won't limit the unique kind of gifts you were born with.Go get em' tiger.",

            "answer": "I just wanted to tell you what everyone else has always told me, that you are no different from anybody else, because every one is different. Don't let diabetes be an excuse. I work as a teacher and I have often worried about my blood sugar going too low while teaching and having no one to cover my class while I go take care of that. Because of those worries my diabetes has become more controllable because I test my blood sugar more often so that I don't have any complications during the day.You are definately right about needing/wanting a job that gives you stability. That helps you know when you will be eating and testing.About the EMT thing...I think the only difficult thing for you will be getting through EMT school. I had a boyfriend once who went through it and I know how grueling it can be (depending on where you are located and go to school). But once you get through that it is up to you to find a job. Once you have a job all you have to say is \"Look, I have type 1 diabetes and if such and such ever happens to me check my blood sugar first, that could be it.\" But otherwise, you are 18 and should be able to carry the responsibilities it takes to take care of yourself while on the job, even if that means carrying glucose tabs in your pocket, or a small backpack equiped with your meds.Good luck, and don't act like it is hard! We all are different and have obstacles, but don't let your diabetes be one of them!",
