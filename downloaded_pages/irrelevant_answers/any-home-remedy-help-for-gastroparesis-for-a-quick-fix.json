            "answer": "Welcome to the gastroenterology community!\u00a0\u00a0I would actually recommend against drinking a lot of water because it is just more for your stomach to digest.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, permanent liquid diets are doable, and many people with gastroparesis carry them on for months.\u00a0\u00a0Try taking a slow walk around your house and see if that helps your stomach digest a little bit.\u00a0\u00a0You can also try sucking on a ginger candy or drinking some ginger tea, if you are feeling nauseous.I too have gastroparesis and am currently fed 100% through a J tube.\u00a0\u00a0Let me know if you have any questions!",
