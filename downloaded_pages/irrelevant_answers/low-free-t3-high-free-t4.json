This would show up on ultrasound.Is her diabetes type I or type 2?\u00a0\u00a0Please describe her menstrual symptoms and elaborate on the other symptoms she's been experiencing.Does she take meds for diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Is she taking thyroid meds?Have any other meds or supplements been added recently?\u00a0\u00a0Any diet changes?\u00a0\u00a0Any recent trauma, injury, surgery, stress (physical or emotional), weight change?",
