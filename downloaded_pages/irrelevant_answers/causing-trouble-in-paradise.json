            "answer": "Hi!Erectile dysfunction is the inability to develop or maintain an erection of the penis sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. Generally if there is any problem in the normal physiology of erection it can result in failure of erection, weak erection or early loss of erection. Many causes are there of which diabetes and low testosterone are the most important. Hence these should be eliminated first along with varicoceles. Other causes are stress and anxiety, depression, poor communication with your partner, unrealistic sexual expectations making sex a task rather than a pleasure, and fear of non performance based on previous experience. Smoking, alcohol, and illicit drugs can also be a cause. Medical conditions such as high blood pressure, poor circulation and peripheral vascular disease, heart or thyroid conditions,\u00a0\u00a0spinal cord injury, nerve damage (for example, from prostate surgery), or neurologic disorders (such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease) can all cause erection problems. Though these medical conditions may not be there in your boyfriend's case they need case they need to be ruled out one by one. Other than all this it could be injury to shaft of penis due to masturbation.He will need to get certain investigations done like fasting and post prandial sugar, glycosylated hemoglobin levels, complete blood count, PSA, testosterone levels, and ultrasound of the scrotum. Certain tests specific for the functioning of the various layers of the penis are done. I am enumerating them for you. They may not mean anything to you but his urologist may run them if needed. These include:\u00a0\u00a0Penile biothesiometry, Nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT), penile artery angiogram, Digital Subtraction Angiography, magnetic resonance angiography and Corpus Cavernosometry. Please ask him to consult an urologist and be supportive. Take care!",
