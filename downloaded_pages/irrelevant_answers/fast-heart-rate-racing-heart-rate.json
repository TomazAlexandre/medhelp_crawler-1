            "answer": "please try not to worry. My heart rate is getting to 130 just standing up I have anxiety, OCD, PTSD, depression. My heart rate gets 180 when I walk slowly thats a more serious problem my dr is finally looking in to why up till now I have been told I feel so yuck when I try to walk because of anxiety ect it can be a pain in the but bit it maybe true i dont know. Just keep a eye on thing maybe track in note book, write things down how you thinking, feeling when this happen and show it to the dr. But I really think its ok my heart had been 130 often just from standing and I'm still fine still here its when I get to 180 that I feel really bad. How are you tracking your heart rate I recently got ECG type heart rate watch it been really good show me thing that my heart was doing that my dr now is sending me to have the holter monitor for 24. Dont know if you know about the holter monitor or event monitors but if not maybe ask about it cause it may find some thing but 130 really is not high I recently found out your heart can get to 220-(your age) and that concidered safe but thats meant to be when you exercising ect. Please try not worry to much cause if you dont have just anxiety it can lead to anxiety which makes it harder for dr to pay attenstion so I'm finding out. My partner has had to come with me to my dr to help me explain things he talks about the important things and tend to ramble due to anxiety lol. Scared of general Dr's scared of being accused or seen as hyperchondract can make it hard not to come across as one trust me.",
