That's how i'd look at it!!! and she gained about the same as u, and she can fit into her jeans she wore before her pregnancy now, only 2 wks after having her baby. :)))) I've only gained 13 lbs. and i'm 33 wks, but i'm counting the weight i lost to begin with, and now have gained that weight back, so i'm actually only 5 lbs over my pregnancy weight! yay",

            "answer": "Normally, you are supposed to add one pound per week in the last trimester. But I have heard some women not gaining weight in the third trimester. They just get stuck at a particular weight probably because it has reached the limit. But I have not heard of weight loss. However, women with gestational diabetes in some cases, lose weight due to dietary restrictions and then do not gain much weight which is not unusual. Check with another OB-GYN if you can.",

            "answer": "I know when I was pregnant with DS I lost so much wieght during my pregnancy but I was sick (and I eman sick) for the entire nine months. All my nutrients were going right to my DS (which is why it was important for me to take my pre-natals) and he was fine...mommy was just a little undernourished. I even had my doctors really worried about me; my ketoid (however you spell it) was low but i don't remember them doing much about it (this was 7 yrs ago). It all worked out fine though and he was born 7lbs and 10oz and I was surprisingly okay too. Right after having him, the little bit of lbs i did have fell right off...I was smaller after giving birth than I was before I got pregnant...go figure.Is your dr concerned?",

Which makes me not too concerned about it.I've been really sick the entire time as well, but this is the first of me actually losing weight.I did read in \"What to Expect...\" that some women do start to lose weight when they are close to delivery. Well, it has been about 4 weeks now! How close are they talking here????",
