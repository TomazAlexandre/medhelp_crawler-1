I would guess that some other people here on the forum may also be at a loss.That said, there are some amazing people here with knowledge and experience who might be able to lend you the support you need.I want to send you my best wishes and sincere regrets that I can't be of any help.",

I will investigate to see if his Dr is a hepatologist.\u00a0\u00a0If no one locally......we have the Mayo Clinic 3 hours away.\u00a0\u00a0He hate doctors and would rather not go than receive bad news.\u00a0\u00a0It is difficult for me when he cancels appointments.\u00a0\u00a0We had no insurance for a year so our bills are astronomical.\u00a0\u00a0We have it now but he still cancels appointments.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate advise on here so I can take matters into MY OWN hands and see that he gets the treatment he needs.",

I would not rely on the woman that your Husband spoke with.I can relate to your Husband's aversion to doctors and his fear of the bad news he might hear. But, he's at a place where his only hope is getting sound medical attention and I think a transplant clinic is the best place for him to get that attention.Good luck,Mike",
