            "answer": "I had a quintuple bypass at 49. I also did not feel good for quite some time. One and two years earlier cardiologists passed me on full stress tests (dye and scans) - guess they missed the blockage which was 70, 70, 90% not long later. I wish I had demanded a heart catheter test at the start.",

    "question": "I had chest pain and bilateral arm discomfort last week. I am 43 and have been healthy up to this point. No high b/p, no diabetes, no high cholesterol, nothing. My father did have his first heart attack at 50 and died at 62. My mother is still living healthy at 68. I went to my ER and they did a alot of ecg's, lab work, and cxr all of which were negative. They decided to do a exercise stress test, which I did and the dr said it was positive. He then chose to do a echo stress test since he thought the first test may have been a false positive. The stress echo was totally normal and they sent me home from the hospital and told me I was fine. They even said I could start an exercise program I was looking at. My problem is I still am having very non specific chest pain and arm pain. It is sometimes in both my arms and sometimes in my armpits. Sometimes I have sharp pain in the middle of my chest and sometimes my neck and underjaw ache. I know my stress echo was normal but could this be my heart or should I look into other causes for my pain? Just don't feel myself and don't know how reliable the 2nd stress test is. Thanks for your help.",
