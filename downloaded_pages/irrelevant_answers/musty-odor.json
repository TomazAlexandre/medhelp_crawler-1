            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Either the odor is in the room or you feel it come from your husband. Air the room and see if the smell persists or not. Air all the clothes and clean the cupboards. There could be dampness some where that is causing musty odor.The other possibility is body sweat. Diabetes, thyroid disorders, carcinoid syndromes and excess sulfite in the diet should be ruled out as possible causes for body odor.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
