            "answer": "We are so glad to hear that your friend made it safely through the surgery and is going home soon. I, like your friend, was diagnosed years ago when glucometers had not been invented, and the insulin treatments that were available did not come close to matching digestive rates for foods. It was HARD back then to maintain any semblance of good control. Even though your friend's kidney failure is a serious complication, dialysis can keep her going, and perhaps she can be a candidate for a kidney transplant (and sometimes people who have kidney transplants can have pancreas transplants, too). My point in bringing this up is to ask you to encourage her to get the best possible control over her glucose levels right now so as to preserve the health of her other major organs. Even though the damage to the kidneys cannot be undone, she CAN and SHOULD take great care to keep those sugar levels as normal as is possible now to protect herself from future damage. That much is in her control, and sometimes we have to put real effort into controlling what we can. I wish her the very best.",
