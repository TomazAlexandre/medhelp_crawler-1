            "answer": "HiI do understand your concern. Based on your post, this sounds like a yeast infection. I think you are being managed well and as you have also posted, you have been compliant with both medical and supportive therapies. Yeast infections may be recurrent. This may be triggered by hormonal changes, medications, diet and even stress.How old are you? If you are taking any immunosuppressants like steroids for asthma, these may be contributory .Also, have you had your blood sugar levels checked?",

            "answer": "Hi VanessaI am 22, I have never had my blood sugar levels checked. My doctor mentioned something about the possibility of it being diabetes but she also told me that she was sure I had gonorrhea and asked how promiscuous I was on every visit.\u00a0\u00a0So I was a little skeptical because I feel like she just names off common diseases instead of listening to me.\u00a0\u00a0I do not take immunosuppressants and I was on birth control (First time ever) but only for three months and then I stopped when my husband was deployed.\u00a0\u00a0I was on an tetracycline for about 5 months for acne but I stopped taking that in March when all of these problems were occurring and I read that long-term antibiotic care can cause yeast infections.I know my family has a slight history of diabetes, my great grandmother and a great aunt both on my father's side but no one in my immediate family.\u00a0\u00a0I probably should get my blood sugar levels tested.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate your' post.I appreciate your' post",

    "question": "I have been married for 5 months and about 3 months ago I developed a severe yeast infection.\u00a0\u00a0I had fissures, burning, irritated skin and it was very painful.\u00a0\u00a0Sex was impossible and I went to the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0They said it was a yeast infection gave me Diflucan and sent me home.\u00a0\u00a0It didn't go away so I went back to the doctor I was diagnosed again with a yeast infection and this time a bacterial infection I got another diflucan and some teraconazole cream and went home.\u00a0\u00a0It has been another month since then but I am still having burning irritated skin.\u00a0\u00a0The fissures have healed but it very uncomfortable and nothing seems to work.\u00a0\u00a0I have changed my diet and am on a strict no yeast, sugar, dairy, and fruit diet.\u00a0\u00a0I am very faithful about the diet and also do not use any kind of scented soap and wear cotton panties and loose clothing. I have also tried several homeopathic remedies such as coconut oil and tea tree oil, these have given me the most relief but it is not going away. My husband is deployed and so I am currently abstinent.\u00a0\u00a0We both had other partners but they were a year before we got married, I tested negative for STD's and Herpes. I noticed the burning and itching gets worse close to my period, I wash twice a day once with pure olive oil soap and once with just water.\u00a0\u00a0I have done a lot a research and I would like to get this fixed before my husband comes home!!\u00a0\u00a0I am seriously tired of this and would really appreciate some good advice.",
