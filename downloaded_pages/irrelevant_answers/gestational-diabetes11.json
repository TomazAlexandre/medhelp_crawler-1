            "answer": "Wow, could be cause you're still early in pregnancy? I'm no expert on the topic, but as you know i'm dealing with it for the third time too, and i think it mainly gets harder to control towards the end, thats why they don't test til 28 weeks or so. I do know that when i was tested my results weren't super high, but just over the borderline, and that was at 29 weeks. Just enjoy the fact that you still can have your treats now, as it may get harder to control later on.",

            "answer": "Well, i'm really surprised today, my partner took me out to lunch, and i had a chicken burger and salad. I had all these good intentions of removing the bread roll and just eating the chicken breast and salad, but i was so hungry i ended up eating it. Then i remembered reading on here somewhere that a lady said if you ate a tablespoon of peanut butter after every meal, it can bring down your levels. So i came straight home and ate a spoonful, and i tested 2 hours later and my reading was a 6! I couldn't believe it, i thought for sure i'd be over after eating the white bread roll, as long as i'm 7 or under thats good. Don't know whether the peanut butter theory worked, or if it was their type of bread roll, but i was happy!",

            "answer": "Maybe it is the peanut butter! I don't worry about portion sizes either when it comes to protein, i find that i can have a HUGE steak with salad or vegies (no potatoes tho) and my levels stay under. When i make spaghetti bolognese i have to measure out 1/2 cup of pasta, but can have as much meat sauce as i like. I met a friend for lunch at coffee club today and i had 2 pieces of raisin toast, and i only just made it under my levels, 6.9, i think what saved me was walking up and down the mall afterwards. So i guess what they say is true, about doing some walking as exercise to keep sugars under. Easier said than done though, when i'm 37 weeks and utterly exhausted!",

    "question": "Ok..I had gd w/all three babies ..now on my fourth babie and my doctor let me skip the glucose test and sent me right to the diabetes educator..which I agreed ..why\u00a0\u00a0put my body threw all that when most likely I'll have it again. .so I've been checking\u00a0\u00a0my sugar for a few days now and it's been normal even on the low side?? I'm only 14wks ..could it be it just haven't kicked inn yet?? Or is it possible I\u00a0\u00a0might escape it all together this time around?? Yesterday I even had a reeses pb agg ane and coffee with milk and three sugars\u00a0\u00a0to see if\u00a0\u00a0my sugar would go up and it was fine two hours later reading 83??",
