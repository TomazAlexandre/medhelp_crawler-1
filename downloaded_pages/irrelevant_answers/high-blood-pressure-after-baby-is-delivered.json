    "question": "Wondered if any of you had heard of this or been through it.\u00a0\u00a0My 2nd son was born Oct 26, 2 weeks early.\u00a0\u00a0I was showing signs of going into labor so the Dr. put me in and broke my water because my blood pressure had started going up the last 2 weeks before.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a totally normal blood pressure thru the entire pregnancy, even below normal at times, so I was surprised when it started going up.\u00a0\u00a0While in the hospital it continued to stay extremely high and has since stayed high now a week and a half after delivering.\u00a0\u00a0She has put me on blood pressure medicine because my bottom number was staying over 100.\u00a0\u00a0She says I have pregnancy induced hypertension but I thought having the baby would have remedied this.\u00a0\u00a0Have any of you ever had this happen to you after giving birth where your blood pressure stayed high?I have been blessed with an almost 5 yr old boy and now another son whom is doing really well but I don't feel good at all.\u00a0\u00a0Would appreciate any help you may have.\u00a0\u00a0Thank You.",
