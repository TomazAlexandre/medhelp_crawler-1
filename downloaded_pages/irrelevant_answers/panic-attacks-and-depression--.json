            "answer": "I have never experienced severe panic/anxiety attacks, but if I don't have my glucometer, insulin and some form of glucose with me at all times I feel panicky and anxoius.\u00a0\u00a0So, I don't think having anxiety about diabetes is odd, but severe anxiety should probably be approached.\u00a0\u00a0Does she talk to a therapist?\u00a0\u00a0Maybe you could see if she would go to a diabetes support group so that she could see that she is not the only one dealing with diabetes and not the only one with fears and anxiety. Have you tried going to www.jdrf.org the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation website.\u00a0\u00a0This site would be helpful to you and your daughter.\u00a0\u00a0You would be able to find support groups in your area.The headaches I am not sure about, but maybe you should seek help from a neuroligist.\u00a0\u00a0I do not get headaches myself, but maybe that is due to the stress of her anxiety and diabetes.",

            "answer": "My daughter suffered from severe panic attacks for over a year and a half (she was 10-11 years old). I had to rearrange my work schedule so that I could wait with her before school. I could not even leave her in the car and go the bank machine (staying in sight). Shopping anywhere was a nightmare, should she for some reason lose sight of me, and she would even have them in the house on occasion (I was in the back garden). They were truly horrendous for her and extremely stressful for me too!We were fortunate enough to see a homeopathic GP and after one or two tries of different remedies, he prescribed Aconite 200, a homeopathic remedy. She took it for three days running at the same time every day, and literally within 24 hours of the last dose was willing to walk a block and a half to someone's house -- something that would have been unthinkable just days earlier. She carried an emergency dose with her for about 9 months after that, but only needed it on one occasion. The change was miraculous. I recommend taking your daughter to a homeopath -- although sometimes you have to try several different remedies, when they do hit on the right one, it works far better than any drug. I can't recommend it highly enough.Homeopathy takes a holistic approach, so the doctor talked with my daughter for quite a while to find out what kind of person she was, what things she might be worried or stressed about, what her emotional make-up was in addition to her physical build etc. The remedies are all natural and based on the idea, as far as I understand, that 'a little of what ails you can cure you'. I have been treated for depression and other menopausal symptoms with homeopathy and I have always been amazed by the effectiveness.",

    "question": "my 17 year old daughter has been diabetic since October 2005. Since November last year she has been having severe panic/anxiety attacks. We are now home-schooling her as she feels so vunerable in the large school environment. Because of this she is very depressed at not being able to experience life as she used to. She also has a continuous headache that does not respond to normal painkillers. Is all of this 'normal' and do we have to accept these symptoms as being part of her illness?",
