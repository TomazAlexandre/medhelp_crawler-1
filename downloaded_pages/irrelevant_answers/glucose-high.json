And while you're adding, they mine as well add the \"A1c\" test which will give you the average of your blood glucose for the last 2-3 months. If it me, I'd save my money at this point and not order another Heptimax till at least week 4.Be well,-- Jim",

            "answer": "What has you glucose been running before tx? reason is mine was almost always 99 towards the end of tx it was climbing my last one done it was 115, and the doc pulled me off one blood pressure pill its a diuretic and said this one could cause it to rise, and put me on an old one called lasik will see how this one does, please watch your glucose, and your blood pressure, hopefully once all those meds are out of ya , you wont have to worry, but I really have a feeling that the tx pushed me over the boderline\u00a0\u00a0on the glucose and the pressure.....",

Maybe I am just terrible at the \"google\" thing LOL.Boy am I feeling better (other than the rash). Those steroids must be something! My physical health (other than this STUPID rash) feels like a million dollars today, aside from bieng so weak and outta shape after all these months.
