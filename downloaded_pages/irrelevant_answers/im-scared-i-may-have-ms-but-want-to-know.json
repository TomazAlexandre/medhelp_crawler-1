            "answer": "If it is MS, you have many treatment options at your disposal, you have many support groups available in person or online such as this one. Ask questions anytime!I was scared too upon diagnosis and during the relapse that led up to it, and I didn't have an online forum at my disposal. Eight years later, having treated the disease with weekly injections that I certainly despise (but they're better than the alternative) I realize my fears were unfounded. I have a 6-year-old child, and another on the way this summer. I'm running as fast as I have in the last 10 years, and I'll run my first-ever half marathon later this month. Yes, others' results may vary, but MS is not a death sentence, and many people are here and elsewhere, including your family, to help guide you through the rougher times and celebrate your good times!",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for that reassurance. Part of me wants a referral because my head tells me there's something not right n there hasn't been for a long time yet part of me wants my GP to say don't be silly there's nothing wrong. He's already hinted at anxiety n yes u have a very stressful job but I am the water off a ducks back kind of person n just can't see it being that. Thanks again I have been reading these boards n they do help ... do you or anyone else have any advice re my symptoms about relief n control and even just to clarify to me that these are usual with MS or not .... my numbness although happens on both sides tends to be worse on the left .... is this usual with MS??? Thanks again Jenny x",

            "answer": "First a heads up, women with Autistic children commonly get told they are just stressed or that its all anxiety related, sometimes thats true but sometimes its not true. Having a disabled child does not exclude anyone from having other medical conditions, go through the tests until the answer becomes clear.To be honest, \"all over\" or \"both sides\" or \"4 limbs\" isn't usually MS related, that falls into whats called 'red flags' but that still doesn't mean its psychological. If your only experiencing these numb or tingling sensations in the peripheral during and after you've been sitting, then thats an indication of things like circulational issues or impinged nerves etcThere are a large number of MS mimics with tingling and peripheral numbness, and most are detected via blood tests, eg diabetes, hypoglycemia, thyroid, Vit deficiencies etc so at this stage in the dx process, when your looking 'atypical' for MS its important that you find your calm and keep it all in perspective until you have a better idea of whats going on.In the mean time, it never hurts to look at your life style and see if there is anything you can change, improve upon to get you at your optimum health, if it was something like MS, you'd be doing it anyway and at least it gives you a starting point, regardless of test results.Cheers........JJMum of two with ASD",

    "question": "I have never written on a board like this before but I am petrified I have got MS. For almost year I have been getting pins n needles and numbness in hands/arms and feet/legs which at first I thought was bad circulation n then I worried about diabetes. This has been getting progressively worse n for the last 6 months I've been getting tingling waves over my body making me very itchy particularly on my head.\u00a0\u00a0I have also had eye strain for about 18mths n went to opticians again who gave me glasses to assist with focus n reduce the strain rather because my actual vision was impaired.\u00a0\u00a0A couple of weeks ago I stood up n fell down again because my left leg just gave way n I couldnt felt it. My hands spasm all the time n hurt like growing pains. This week I woke up at 11am not like me had another couple of hrs on the couch n felt sick when I had up get up cause I was that tired. I am so tired n iterative n have headaches behind my eyes all the time. Just the other day I felt like I had burnt my arm the feeling you get after a few hours but nothing was there. I finally went to the GP today who has done blood tests n says to go back next Friday for results m he will do a neuro exam n may refer me.\u00a0\u00a0I can't think about anything else I'm certain it's going to be MS n I'm so scared. I'm 30 have a wonderful husband and 2 kids one who is autistic n a great job .... my biggest fear ix not bring able to look after my kids n losing respect at work with them thinking I'm incapable.\u00a0\u00a0Do you think I'm being silly or right to think it could be MS n what happens now??? Thanks so much for listening Jen x",
