            "answer": "I think you are eligible to see a sepcialist (RE) since you have been trying for over a year, and you have some male factor infertility issues.\u00a0\u00a0You could get a referral from your urologist or your wifes gynecologist. The RE will do a full workup on you and your wife, and go over your options. I know you said your wife has been checked, but an RE may do a much more thorough investigation to see if her horomone levels are ok, make sure there are no tubal blockages, no fibroids, cysts, diabetes, thyroid problems, excess prolactin, etc. etc.\u00a0\u00a0Then your options will be based on both your and your wife's results.Some of these procedures and tests can be expensive, so perhaps that is what is meant by \"she has to qualify\"-for insurance coverage maybe??\u00a0\u00a0Best of uck",

    "question": "I went to a urologist done a semen analyses came back as having microlithiasis, that means that my sperm has an abnormal\u00a0\u00a0shape, some of my sper 7% is normal. I have been trying with my wife for over a year now with no success, do this mean we are not able to get pregnant due to my condition. She went to get checked out and everything is ok with her.My question is does she or I have to go to see a reproductive endroconlogist, or do I have to see a male infertility specialist. i am trying to speed this up to do the artificial insemination process. I dont want to wait any longer, its been long enough.What are our next steps to do this. They also told me that she has to qualify i dont get it what does that mean.l\u00a0\u00a0have all the papars that say she is ok and I am the problem with the oddly shaped sperm.Thanks!!",
