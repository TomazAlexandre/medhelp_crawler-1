            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I am sorry to hear about your grand father. One possibility is benign intracranial hypertension. This can be diagnosed only by a spinal tap. Though usually there is a headache, it can happen without one. Other than this it can be due to diabetes or liver or kidney problem. Hence blood tests for blood sugar and kidney and liver function will need to be done.Please consult your PCP for primary examination and discussion regarding this. The neurologist will need to be consulted again for benign intracranial hypertension.Take care!",

I called an ambulance and his body temp upon arrival to the hosp. was 92. Following that he c/o constant dizziness where his eyes shift back/forth, pain in his left eye, weakness in the left leg, leaning to the left when walking or standing, constant urination, and is currently unable to walk without assistance. He's been in good health up to this point; gardening, grocery shopping and driving. Doctors diagnosed him with vertigo and sent to a nursing facility for rehab. MRI of head & neck, MRA, CT scan, doppler of neck reveal no stroke. Any ideas or how I can get him some help?",
