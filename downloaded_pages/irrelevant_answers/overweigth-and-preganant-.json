            "answer": "HI there, I am overweight too, and so far everything has gone well for me. The doctor did tell me to slow down on my gaining weight because I have also been gaining weight like crazy, never thought it would happen to me but oh boy has it. I am six months along and so far no problems, except I failed my glucose test so I need to take the 2 hour test, and hopefully I will be ok. I would say just be careful of what you eat and exercise, I am already regretting my choices and it ***** so watch your diet!",

            "answer": "Well your weight does give you a higher risk for many things. But if you work together with your doc, it will help min your chance of having High Risk Pregnancy, pre, eclampsia, early or threatened labor, pregnancy induced hypertension, gestational diabetes, and other co morbid conditions. By eating right and walking or doing exercise that your doctor will allow you too, you help help your chances of not being put into High Risk. Good luck and have a healthy and happy 9 months.",
