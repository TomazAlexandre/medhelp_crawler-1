            "answer": "The normal blood sugar is usually 70-110. I think it was fine, except for the 56 you got. The symptoms of diabetes are usually hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), and that is because the pancreas doesnt secrete enough insulin which would bring the blood sugar down. If you have a glucometer and find that you have hypoglycemia, it can easily be corrected with a 1/2 glass of OJ or about 5 lifesavers.",

            "answer": "Hi jane6922,My thought when you mentioned a glucometer when was it\u00a0\u00a0calibrated last. Results on a glucometer is not reliable without intermittent calibration.If it was me, I would continue to check your fasting blood sugar until you can get into your physican & see if there is a consistency in running low or not. Also recheck 1/2 after eating & see if it raises like it should.Quote...(Now yesterday, I got tested on a glucometer about an hour after waking up and not eating after 12 hours (I also have that time of the month- I don't know if that has anything to do with it) and my results were 56. I momentarily stopped worrying but now I am worrying if I am okay and if it is considered hypoglycemia and I have also heard that hypoglycemia can lead to diabetes, so I am right back in the same spot.)...Even with a blood sugar of 56, without symptoms of hypoglycemia... (sudden onset of hunger which turns to nausea, extreme weakness, sweating, palpitations, lighteadedness, confusion, irritably, tremors which turns into shaking, a feeling of doom),... It's a horrible feeling that is only releived by eating or if allowed to go to far medical intervention.If you still feel concerned, there are other tests your family physican can perform to identify hypoglycemia.Such as a\u00a0\u00a0a glucose tolerance test.Good luck & don't worry so much. If you feel you need to go to the doctor & ask for further testing.God Bless, TJ",

            "answer": "I do not like to be rude, but why did jane6922 just not start a separate post of her own? Her question and the answers are confusing me because I don't know who is answering to who, even if it says to who, since there are incidences when the message is directed to jane but contains quotes from my post.I was the one with the test result of 56. The odd thing was I did not feel bad at any aspect. I felt perfectly fine. I was not hungry, tired, sluggish, shaky, or anything. I had no desire to eat.I forgot to mention that prior to gaining 40 pounds (I generally always weighed about 140 pounds) my fasting blood sugar was always in the 60's range. The last fasting blood test I had at a weight of 140 pounds, my blood sugar was 66.Of course, if I was not on Seroquel and someone could give me an exact answer on the whole atypical antipsychotic-diabetes link, I might not be worrying about it so much.The thing is I have no health insurance and no job so going to doctor and getting a blood test is not very affordable right now. Does anyone know how I could get a fasting blood sugar test or some kind of reliable test since I do not have health insurance and that will not cost me my entire bank account?",

The middle one the doctor said was perfect.I figured that pancakes would put a good impact on it. I still wonder what my actual reading would have been if I had fasted. I wish I had thought of fasting, but the reason I was going was not something you would get a blood test for.The reading of 56 by the glucometer was not discussed with my doctor. I have not been to the doctor since sometime in 06 and I had my finger pricked in March of this year. My sister, who is an RN and frequently gets diabetic patients, told me it was fine, but I am still leary. She said a glucometer reading could be off from a fasting blood test but the difference is usually not that big.",

            "answer": "The sad thing is that is not the first time- and probably not the last time- I have heard that. I have heard it many, many times. This is also not the first time I have been overly worried that there is something wrong with me. Last year I was hospitalized because I was so overly worried that there was something wrong with me (not diabetes though; something neurological) that I was contemplating suicide (which also may have had to do with the medicine I had went on at the same time because as soon as I went off the medicine I was not feeling the way I did). I have never been told I was a hypochondriac, but I have been giving other diagnoses, specifically obsessive compulsive disorder.Thanks for the link, though, because I have such an obsession with medical topics, I already know most of the information listed.The only people I know of that have diabetes in the family are my father's two sisters- both of which are very overweight and were not diagnosed until later ages (around their 50's or later).The thing that I am worried about is if my blood sugar has risen since I started the Seroquel. The last time I had a fasting blood sugar test (the blood test one) was before I went on the Seroquel. The only test I have had done since I started Seroquel was the glucometer one, which some diabetics told me is not as accurate in diagnosing as having the fasting blood sugar test done. If I were not on Seroquel or if I could just get a straight answer about the whole diabetes- Seroquel link (like some say it can only come on if you gain weight with the medication, some say it can come on whether or not you gain weight; some say it can only come on with certain dosages, some say it can come on with any dosage; some say you have to be on the medication a long time for it to come on, some say it can come on suddenly; some say it is a temporary problem, some say it is permanent)......well, I would not even be on here. I know that I annoy a lot of people with my excessive worrying. It's not like I enjoy it. I am on medicine for it (Prozac) and it helps somewhat, but not like it should.The good thing is, I am taking steps to getting healthier. I have been exercising almost every day, watching what I eat, etc. and I am coming off the Seroquel.Sorry I wrote so much.",

            "answer": "All:I have both Reactive Hypoglycemia and Type II Diabetes. Before some of you folks in the medical field come back with you cannot have both, think again, and do a bit of research.I am not talking specifically about just fasting Hypoglycemia that is mainly from going a long time without eating and exerting yourself at that time. Reactive Hypoglycemia is caused by a sugar spike like the one used in an OGTT of 75G of carbohydrate (Sugar), and it don't have to be 75G to cause the problem. Some folks have symptoms when there sugar drops below 70 and some do not, I am fortunate to get a great deal of the symptoms and an early to do something. My symptoms are brought on by two different things the severe spike downward and the level itself. As I become more diabetic, the spike downward will not be as sharp. Why is that you may ask?Reactive Hypoglycemia is a condition where the Pancreas is continuously putting insulin into the bloodstream because of the high sugar in your system and the pancreas has a defect that is causing it not to shut off the insulin valve. This is because of all the sugar that has been in my diet for many many years that resulted in abuse to my pancreas and other organs. Believe me I could go through a 1/2 gallon of ice cream in one sitting and then be looking for a candy bar or something else to eat. Those with Hypoglycemia go on to Pre-Diabetes and Type II Diabetes if treatment does not happen immediately.The treatment for Hypoglycemia is very similar to a Diabetic except your sugar intake is lowered even more. For example, you cannot eat bananas or grapes, not at all. No candy, cake, cookies at all. Someone asked, and that is it. You should see a nutritionist after you are diagnosed with Hypoglycemia, Diabetes, or both. They need to know exactly what you have. Your doctor may not be the right person to tell you what to eat after diagnosis, in fact, they are not a jock of all trades, like folks who have the diseases.Check out the below link to see some OGTT curves and the diagnosis, it even lit up my regular doctor who validated the report from Holland. For the record I had three OGTT tests that were all close to each other and curve #10. However, my level spiked to 247 mg/dl in the first hour and followed the same curve all the way down to the 4 hour mark, I never made it passed the 4th hour because I went into severe shock in the low 60's.Both my Doctor and Endocrinoligist diagnosed me as a Pre-Diabetic based on two FPG tests with readings of 126 and then 120, and a 2 hour OGTT that indicated 120 at the start and 160 after 2 hours. They did not concern them selves with the fact that 3-1/2 hours later I had developed signs of Hypoglycemia and went into shock and had a FPG reading of 62. It was chalked off to fasting for 15 hours.It did not become evident till 5 months after I was on a diabetic diet and was monitoring my meals and 3-1/2 hours later I had readings in the 60s with signs of Hypoglycemia such as profuse sweating, blurry vision, dizzy. Also I would be sweating profusely at night and when I checked my readings they were in the 70s and 60s. I always sweat a lot at night and have done so for the past 2-3 years. The temperature is never higher then 75 in my home and the humidity is kept below 55% (Top of the line Lennox system).By the way, the accuracy of most glucose meters is less accurate when you go below 100 and lead to the high side. There is documented proof of this by a well known Endocrinoligist. I am an electronics and metrology expert with over 30 years experience. I have a Masters degree in Electronics and was also Certified in Metrology (Calibration) by NIST. I won't go into all the reasons why your meter is not as accurate as you may like to believe, but there are reasons why your doctor wants tests done in the Lab, their equipment and processes are monitored very closely.http://hypoglykemie.nl/Notice the readings in #2 and you will understand why I was only diagnosed with Pre-Diabetes for the 2 Hour OGTT. Diabetes folks are not interested in going past the 2 hour mark.Again Diabetes is too much Glucose in your system because of IFG and IGT. Reactive Hypoglycemia is too much insulin in your system. You can have both conditions. Diabetes is a disease, Reactive Hypoglycemia is a Syndrome.I am not a doctor, just a patient who has no patience for doctors who need you to do the research for them.Advice to all who have symptoms with no definitive answers. Do your research and make your doctor sit down with you and go through it, repeat your symptoms, if you monitor your blood show him the results, having diabetes software helps, show him what you are eating, eventually light bulbs will go off.Billhttp://hypoglykemie.nl/",

    "question": "I am going out of my mind with worry over the thought of having diabetes. The whole thing that sparked it was reading about the Seroquel, which I am on, and diabetes link.I am 5'3 and between 180 and 185 pounds. Back in December of 05 I had a fasting blood suagr test done after being extremely anxious and stressed that I may have diabetes (deja vu) and my results were 88. A month later I had another fasting blood sugar test done and my results were in the upper 60s or lower 70s (I can't remember the exact number- I am thinking maybe it was 71). A few months later in April of 06, I made an appointment and did not expect to get a blood test so I had eaten pancakes for breakfast before I went and was surprised to get a test done. I don't know if the pancakes would affect the test, but my results were 89.I went on Seroquel in July of 06. For a month I was upped dosages and then at the end of August I settled on 50 mg and had no weight gain. Now yesterday, I got tested on a glucometer about an hour after waking up and not eating after 12 hours (I also have that time of the month- I don't know if that has anything to do with it) and my results were 56. I momentarily stopped worrying but now I am worrying if I am okay and if it is considered hypoglycemia and I have also heard that hypoglycemia can lead to diabetes, so I am right back in the same spot.Any advice?",
