    "question": "My husband is type 2 diabetes and has been able to control it without medication, but they recently found that he also has a thyroid issue and put him on synthroid 100mcga day and his blood sugar levels have been running any where from 126 to 182. The doctor said that they don't usually start meds until the levels start running in the 200. Does this sound right or should we seek a second opinion.",
