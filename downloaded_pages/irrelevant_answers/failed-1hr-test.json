I had to fast for bothas far as I'm concerned,\u00a0\u00a0nothing will be affected.If you do fail the 3 hour,\u00a0\u00a0you just have to check your blood a few times a day, change your diet and baby may be monitored more so you don't have a big baby.Having gestational diabetes doesn't change much honestly with your baby",

My lil boy wieghed 8.7lbs.You do not HAVE to have a csection if you do have GD. Now I'm preg with my 2nd I failed my 1hr test and when I did my 3hr one I walked around between each blood drawing and I passed it! Don't be afraid if you do have GD tho... they usually offer a class if you are diagnosed and it helps a lot!",
