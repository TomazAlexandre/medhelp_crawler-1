            "answer": "Storm,Thanks for the post.#1. I have a couple tattoo's from long ago, I would like another. Is this safe with my heart arrthymias?? Should I be pre medicated like at the dentist?I'm sure some will disagree with me here, but honestly I wouldn't recommend getting another tattoo. Since you have kidney disease I would be worried about the healing process and the risk of infection from a tattoo regardless of the sterility with which it was performed.#2. My Gynocologist wants to start me on bith control pills (my tubes are tied) to help with uterine problems I am having. I know there is a risk of blood clots, heart attck & stroke with birth control pills, I took them back in my 20's. Now I DO NOT smoke, but am over weight.I have never had a clotting problem & the doctor has just kept me on the Plavix & asprin since my surgery. What is your opinion. I know you can not diagnos me. Will the Plavix & Asprin prevent blot clots with birth control pills???????????????????????They may decrese the likelyhood of getting clots, but not entirely. Obesity increases the thrombotic risk of oral contraceptives as does the existance of other medical problems such as diabetes and kidney disease. I would be careful with oral contraceptives and keep regular followup with your prescribing physician.good luck",

I've been on and off a meds (Zocor\\Tricor). Both my parents are diabetic and have similar blood test readings.I've been going to the doctor for about 5 years now....my trigs were once as high as 980, my chol was as high as 258. I've gotten both down with diet\\meds to trigs between 250-400 and chol 225-240.My question is, I've yet to tackle this problem now for almost 5 years. How long does it take for long lasting issues to settle in. Issues like clogged arteries ect.I've become obsessed with my health at this point and have prob. made matters worse for me as I've developed severe anxiety attacks at any feeling or pain in my chest or any other part of my body.Please help...",
