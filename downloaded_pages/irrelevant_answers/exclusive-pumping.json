            "answer": "I started exclusively pumping after 2 weeks...my daughter was a lazy nurser and not putting on weight plus she wasn't draining me so I ended up getting mastitis...once I started exclusively pumping things went incredibly smoothly...just make sure you pump at at the same frequency that baby eats and that you continue pumping until nothing is coming out...I had no problems with supply and continued to pump until she was 10 months old...in the beginning it would help to use heating pads to help with let down and get things flowing",

            "answer": "Oh a there really isn't much of a point to start pumping before baby unless you are just trying to get labor going...it's the drop in hormones that occurs when you loose the placenta that will tell your body to start producing milk...anything that comes out before that is just colostrum",

            "answer": "I would definitely not recommend pumping before the baby is born.\u00a0\u00a0 Nursing releases a hormone that makes your uterus contract (so after the baby is born your uterus will go back to pre-baby size).I didn't exclusively pump but I did pump a lot - I went back to work when babies were 6 weeks or so.\u00a0\u00a0If you have more questions - let us know!",
