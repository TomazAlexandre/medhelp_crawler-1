    "question": "So I remember with my last pregnancy my fingers will fall asleep and start to get numb after a while. I told my doctor but didn't get much help on it. Now with this pregnancy I'm feeling it again.My right hand will start to numb and it hurts really bad. It happens all the time. While I'm sleeping, reading,texting and even some times put of no where. I has DG with my last pregnancy but not sure if I have it with this one yet(extra info just in case that might have to do with it) I'm going to bring it up to my doctor again in my next visit. Anyone felt this? Could it be just my blood flow?",
