            "answer": "IBS is diagnosis given when all other disorders are excluded. So, officially you can't have IBS and gastroparesis at the same time.IBS appear with alternating constipation/diarrhea and abdominal cramps - symptoms are often triggered by meal and, typically, relieved by having a bowel movement.Gastroparesis would appear with nausea, belching, maybe constipation, early satiety...In, IBS you would need a particular food or group of foods that irritate you. \"FODMAP diet\" - basically a low-sugar diet is the first to try, if you ask me.IN gastroparesis, small meals and avoiding foods that stay a long time in the stomach (fats, loads of proteins: meaning: meat, cakes, nuts, eggs..) should help.It would be good to know a cause of gastroparesis also.",

            "answer": "That is what I suspected.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for the info. It is likely that my gastroparesis was caused by tricyclic antidepressants ( tofranil in my case ) which I have taken since 1975. My shrink agrees and we have agreed to wean off. He thinks the damage will be reversed after I am off of this med. Does that make sense to you?\u00a0\u00a0 Jim",

            "answer": "Yes, antidepressants may cause gastroparesis. Not necessary that this is (the only) cause in your case. It may also take some time that the stomach will start to work properly. Other drugs and chronic diseases that affect nerves (diabetes...) may also cause gastroparesis.",
