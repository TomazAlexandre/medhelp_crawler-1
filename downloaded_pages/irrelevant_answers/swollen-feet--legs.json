            "answer": "My daughter has exactly the same issues with her health. She may also suffer from P.A.D. (periphal artery disease) as well. She has a bad habit of sitting a great part of her day, which causes her legs to swell quite badly. She recently found out that she had type II diabetes as well. I suggested that she elevate her legs as much as possible -- and spend at least 20 minutes outside walking, for a start. She was fortunate enough to take her diabetes seriously, so she lost 40 pounds and it has done wonders for the swelling in her legs and brought her blood pressure down also! She has a good doctor and she is taking her health seriously. I wish you the very best .. take care!",
