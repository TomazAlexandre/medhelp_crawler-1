            "answer": "Hi obirek,I have a few thoughts to share:1. I've never heard of a 2-year-old who sits down and eats a whole, \"proper\" meal-- his behavior is perfectly normal for any toddler. They are grazers by nature.2. A family history of type II diabetes has absolutely no connection with juvenile (type I) diabetes. When our daughter was diagnosed with type 1, I assumed there must be a connection to type 2, which my husband and most of his family have, but I then learned all about it-- and as our endocrinologist said, it was just \"an unhappy coincidence.\" So don't worry about your toddler getting type 2. If he stays in the normal weight range as a child, type 2 should not be a risk until well into adulthood-- and it may never be if he stays fit and active.3. As for the false positive, what you're talking about isn't really a \"positive\"-- it's more of a gray area, or borderline, as your doctor said. (We did a false finger-***** test with our non-diabetic younger daughter, who had been thirsty a lot-- the meter showed a blood glucose of 300, but after her sister's doctor insisted that we bring her in for testing immediately, we figured out that it was peach residue on her unwashed finger that caused the high sugar reading!)4. You didn't say what your pediatrician wanted to do about the \"borderline\" test. I would assume you would need to test his sugar more often to see what's going on. I would recommend getting him in to see an endocrinologist who has some expertise with diabetes.I know it's not easy to do, but try not to worry, and please get a more substantive response from a doctor-- which I, of course, am not.Good luck!",

            "answer": "Your post is a little confusing, is it yourself or your daughter you are concerned about having diabetes? Whichever it is, if one or both of you has symptoms you should be tested. Check out low cost or free clinics in your area, and ask about applying for Medicaid if you qualify so you will have coverage. If you know anyone with diabetes, they can also test you with their meter by putting in a fresh lancet. If one of you is pre-diabetic or diabetic you will probably have to reduce your fruit intake as that raises blood sugar.There is no cure for diabetes at this time. Though it seems scary and there is a lot to learn if you are diagnosed, it is a manageable disease and you can live and be healthy with either type 1 or type 2. But you are ahead of yourself, as first you need to be diagnosed. If you are found to have pre-diabetes it is a great opportunity to learn how to lower blood sugar with diet, weight loss and exercise to keep it from progressing.",

    "question": "We went to our pediatrician for a routine well visit checkup.\u00a0\u00a0She likes to check glucose on even years so since my son was two it was his turn.\u00a0\u00a0It was 121, by a finger *****.\u00a0\u00a0Right before we went to the Doctors he napped (3 hours) and did not have anything to eat (I woke him up and put him into the car) but a cracker and watered down apple juice.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor sent us for lab work this morning and we will have the results on Friday.\u00a0\u00a0My husband's Father, Aunt, and Grandmother have Type II.As far as symptoms go, yes he drinks ALOT and in turn urinates a lot.\u00a0\u00a0I did not think it was a problem until now.\u00a0\u00a0As far as eating, he is always in the fridge \"munching\".\u00a0\u00a0Since he was born he ate every 2 hours.\u00a0\u00a0I can't get him to sit down and eat a full meal so once again, I did not think this was an issue.\u00a0\u00a0As far as weight he not over or under.My question....how common is a false positive.\u00a0\u00a0The Dr. said he was borderline...what does that mean?\u00a0\u00a0Once she told me the news, I really did not hear anything else.\u00a0\u00a0I was truly going in for a routine check-up.Thanks!!",
