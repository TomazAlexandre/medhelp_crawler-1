            "answer": "I am afraid that we can't tell you what is causing your symptoms. It could be related to the other nerve problem, or it could be something entirely different. Only your doctor will be able to tell you, for he or she can run the appropriate tests and will know your medical history.",

            "answer": "I have had diabetes for 16yrs now and now i am 24, but I have experienced the numbness too. I have numbness inmy legs, feet, and sometimes hands. My doctors have told me that it was a side effect from diabetes. The nerves in my legs are dying off due to my poor control of blood sugars. Have you talked to your diabetes doctor about this? if not, i would because it could be diabetes related and not a pinched nerve. Best of luck to you!!!",

    "question": "i am a 34 year old male who has been suffering with numbness to my left thigh for aprox 5yrs and was told by a specialist that it was a result of a pinched nerve in my groin due to my increase in weight and if i lost weight it would heal itself. i lost some kilos but the numbness still remains. in the last 3weeks i have had tingling sensations and occasional numbness in my left pinkie leading up to my ball joint.Can someone please give me an idea as to whether these are related and what is the cause and ultimately what is the solution? thanks",
