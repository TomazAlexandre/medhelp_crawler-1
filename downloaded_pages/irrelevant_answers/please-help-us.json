            "answer": "She has been having menstral cycles since age 9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She is tall for her age of 11 and always has been. She is 5'5\" and weighs around 130.\u00a0\u00a0Her dad is 6'2\" and I, her mom, am 5'8\".\u00a0\u00a0Before the birth control pills she only had a auras but didn't get the headache. Just from talking to her we have recently figured that out. Thought maybe it was low-blood sugar or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 But she had said she got it at recess and she is very sensitive to light. Plus the recess time is 12:30-1:00 which is a pretty bright time of day.The reason the doc put her on bc pills is because her periods in January became longer. First 2 weeks long, then gradually in Feb, 3 weeks long, and then in March she started and it didn't stop for 54 days, until she was on the Trisprentec which did stop her period about the 2nd week of the migrane headache. That we are thankful for but, unfortunately the migrane (which she says is a 6.5 on a 1-10 scale) has not.\u00a0\u00a0He said her body needed to be \"shocked\" back into the way things should be.\u00a0\u00a0 We are trying some home remedies. She is taking a magnesium supplement since yesterday So far, nothing works, and she has missed 3 weeks of school. We do have a neuroligist apt next week.",

    "question": ")Our pediatrician put my 11-year old daughter on Trisprentec because her menstrual cycle wouldn't stop. They did testing for anemia which she didn't have. I was sure to tell him she has had an aura in the past without migranes, because I have read there is a risk of blood clots if taking bc pills when one has migranes.\u00a0\u00a0He still felt the best treatment to stop the period which had been going on about 45 days, was to put her on bc pills.\u00a0\u00a0She took them a week only, because she got a migrane headache after they kicked in.\u00a0\u00a0Too make a long story shorter, she missed several days of school and felt bad, during the first of the week, but by Friday she had a severe migrane. I gave her Advil one week, which didn't work then tried Tylenol which didn't work the\u00a0\u00a0next week. The doc gave her lortab, and fenegran, which put her to sleep but didn't work.Imitrex didn't work, and she tried 1 Maltrox which didn't work.\u00a0\u00a0Even tried dolchik (sp?) which didn't work. This is the start of the 3rd week of her migrane.\u00a0\u00a0She had a CT scan and a pelvic ultrasound, which didn't show anything.\u00a0\u00a0She has missed 2 weeks of school going on 3. Now the pediatrician wants to send her to a neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0Would it be better to send her to an endocronoligist, or would that doc send her to a neurologist?\u00a0\u00a0On a 1 to 10 scale she says her headache is a 6.5.\u00a0\u00a0I have migranes too, and our family has a history of diabetes, and thyroid issues, just FYI.",
