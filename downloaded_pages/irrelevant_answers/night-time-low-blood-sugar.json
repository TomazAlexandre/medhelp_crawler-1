            "answer": "Laura there are so many things that can change our body's response to sugar of lack of it :(I am not as young as your daughter but let me tell you something, hormones are one of the biggest chalenges... maybe she is already going to hormonal changes and it is affecting her night sugar levels. Insulin Pump will make your life easier because you will be able to make adjustments as you learn how her body works throught the month.I am on Pump therapy and it was a blessings but still I deal with scary lows (and I no longer feel my low's). Well... I have many other health issues going on and this makes difficult to manage Diabetes but with all the chalenges, I am doing better.If you are also able to get the continuous glucose monitor, go for it! I am waiting and praying that this time my insurance company will agree and I will get it.God bless,",

            "answer": "hi Laura,my daughter is also 11 and been type 1 since she was 2 and she also has trouble with night time lows ,and on other nights has nightime highs, she has been on an insulin pump now for 2 years so we can change her basal rates to suit her ,but one night can be very different to another so it's hard to regulate her completley. Hormones are definatley causing problems at the moment, so I do test her 2 or 3 times during the night as she never wakes when low, and I can give her a correction bolus if she's high. I think it's worth trying the pump, my daughter finds she has so much more freedom and controll and would not like to go back to shots.I know it's worring for us mums, the pre-teen and teen years are the most challenging but they'll come through it ok, with our continuing monitoring and care! good luck to you bothchrissie",
