            "answer": "If your not overweight the chances of you being anything but an insulin dependent\u00a0\u00a0diabetic at that age is very slim. It is possible to be a 2 at that age but without obesity it is extremely rare. You know some diabetics just don't handle the destruction that it can cause the same. I have had 1 for 30 years, and have just in my later years realized without God I don't stand a chance. But that is a good thing because you get strength from that. Just love your family ask for directions and you will be ok.",

            "answer": "The clusters of autoimmune disorders would make me vote for type 1 diabetes like your doctor thinks. My twin has adrenal problems along with type 1, although I don't have the adrenal issues. But all of the endocrinologists I have seen have always tested for other endocrine disorders when the do annual blood tests because so many type 1 folks do have thyroid problems. Adrenal problems are rarer, but also more common among type 1 patients than among other patients from what I have read. The same autoimmune disorder that causes our bodies to over-react when stimulated by viruses to kill off the pancreas can cause attacks on other endocrine glands.",
