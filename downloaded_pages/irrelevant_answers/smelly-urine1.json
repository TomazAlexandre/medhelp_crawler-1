            "answer": "Hi there,There are several causes of strong odor in the urine.\u00a0\u00a0If you are on Vitamin supplements especially Vitamin B supplements urine can have a strong odor. Also in some medical conditions like diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, urine does have a strong odor.Do increase your daily intake of water to around 8-10 glasses a day and see if the smell decreases. Also do let me know if you have any other medical condition or have any other symptoms beside this. If you are on any medication do let me know.If you have any further queries do get in touch with me.Regards,Dr Sylvester",

            "answer": "Hi, I understand what you are saying about B vitamins, and also asparagus comes to my mind.But could you say a little bit more about the diabetes causes?What about protein in the urine, or any type of kidney damage.Does that cause a smell when it gets worse?And what about if the smell is sort of like ammonia?I have a lot of physical problems and take a lot of medications. have been insulin dependent for 35 years.I am not expecting you to make a diagnosis. I'm just curious, and also an RN, but not currently working. your feedback would be appreciated. Kat",

            "answer": "Hi,Usually in diabetes you must be aware that ketone bodies are generated and these are excreted via urine which gives a sweetish odor to urine.Talking about ammonia in the urine; usually strong smell of ammonia comes when a person is dehydrated. However I recall that you mentioned that the color is fine. So this did not seem as a possibility to me.Have you done a urinalysis in the recent future?\u00a0\u00a0If you haven\u2019t I think it is a good option to have that done.If you have any further queries do get in touch with me.Regards,Dr Sylvester",

            "answer": "Just want to let you know that I am a different person than the original poster. Sorry for barging in. it's interesting what you say about dehydration because I really don't think I drink enough...way too little. I almosty have an aversion to drinking, especially water, and I am suspicious of nutrasweet, and then juices are very limited, of course..so, it's usually caffeine like tea, or even alcohol, (if little)..but stuff that makes it worse and I feel very weak most of the time. I just have to drink more.Thanks again,KATRINPS: And I have protein in my urine and my blood sugars are not that great, either. (further dehydration?)",
