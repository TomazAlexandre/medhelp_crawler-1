Apparently the ecg was normal apart from high heart rate\u00a0\u00a0(sinus tachycardia). Just got the blood reports n have yet to see the doc tomorrow. They said iron levels were very low n kidney also seem to be working hard. Would know exact thing tomorrow. I agree with other ladies here and would suggest you to see your doc. Happy testing :) good luck!",
