            "answer": "Dear Shawn:I am not sure what to tell you.\u00a0\u00a0I would think that when you see your neurologist, based on the findings of the neurological exam a MRI and MRA of your brain might be ordered.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes tinnitus, when things like meniere's has been ruled out there is the possibility of a cyst or abnormal vessel that can give tinnitus (although very unlikely to be bilateral) and ear pain.\u00a0\u00a0The tremors are a bit puzzling.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure what to make of them.\u00a0\u00a0Again the neurological exam will help alot as the neurologist can see if there is any correlation between tremor and muscle weakness.\u00a0\u00a0I would guess that there would be no connection and the tremor might just be a benign fasciculation.Sorry, I'm not much help.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

            "answer": "Thanks for your prompt reply. Can a cyst or abnormal bloodvessel in or near the back/neck cause this or do you think the focus be on the brain. I've had one MRI when I was diagnosed with Strabismus many years ago and all was well.Shouldn't the brainstem response exam have picked up any abnormalities or does that just concentrate on the 8th cranial nerve. In any case I will be seeing my neurologist and on the contrary I do appreciate your commentThanks againShawn",

            "answer": "Dear Shawn:Usually a normal auditory test just indicates that all the hardware is in place and it works okay.\u00a0\u00a0Tinnitus may or may not have a auditory test correlate.\u00a0\u00a0There may be a problem with just inflammation etc.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that you have found an answer by this time.CCF Neuro MD",

    "question": "Thanks for your great service!I'm a 35 year old male who is in otherwise good shape except for the following.First some background:I have been diagnosed as having strabismus 14 years ago. Despite 4 eye operations I still to this day have constant double vision and wear prismsto correct.I have also had numbness in my right thigh for about the same amount of time. It hasn't got worse but it's thereMy problem:In November of last year I have developed a major case of Tinnitus in my left ear and pain in the top of my spine/bottom of neck. I also have occassional pain in both ears and sometimes they feel pretty warm. I don't get headaches but once every three/five days I get a sharp pain in my head (right side above the ear)that goes away in 5 seconds.The pain is not terrible but the tinnitus was driving me crazy. However despite the constant loud ringing I'm learning to live with it in hopes that I can find the cause.I've noticed mild tremors as I'm looking at may face in the mirror and occassional tremors in my legs.My balance has never been the best as you can imagine with my double vision. No vertigo but definately some dizzines.I've had major bloodwork, (diabetes, blood sugar, blood pressure, complete blood count) and all is fine.I've had a hearing test and brainstem response through my ENT and all is fine.I've heard there is no causal relationship between tinnitus andspine/neck problems, but I can make my tinnitus much worse by putting pressure on my neck/spine by placing one hand on my forehead and pushing. The ringing gets real loud!I'm seeing a chiropractor who tells me it's not unusual for nerve compression problems/stress to cause this tinnitus and am seeing my neurologist at the end of February.Any comments you can give me would be much appreciated. You'reservice has been very informative and comforting since I've been using it for the past 4 months.Regards,Shawn",
