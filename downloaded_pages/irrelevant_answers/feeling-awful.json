            "answer": "It sounds like it might be diabetes. I say you need to see a doctor asap. I mean it. Don't delay or go to emerg. Describe your symptoms and ask for a blood glucose level test. If you know someone who has diabetes ask to use their monitor to test your blood if you don't want to go to emerg. If your level is higher than 14 or in the 170 range depending on their settings go to the hospital. By the way I'm a nurse and studying in diabetes education so I encourage you to get checked asap.",
