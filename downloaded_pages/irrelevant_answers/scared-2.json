            "answer": "Hi!Well yes, some women continue to have bleeding at the time they would have had periods even when they are pregnant. However this bleeding is much lighter and shorter. If you have doubt then you can take blood pregnancy test. This test estimates HCG in blood and is more reliable than urine test. Feeling very hungry can also be due to stomach ulcers and severe acidity. Even GERD presents with similar symptoms. At times the hunger pangs due to acidity wakes up a person in the wee hours of night. Omeprazole is a good drug to combat this. Along with it you can try over the counter antacids. However I would recommend you see a doctor and take medication under a doctor\u2019s supervision. Avoid heavy meals and take frequent small ones. Avoid too much of caffeine, tea, fried food and drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic fuzzy ones.The other possibility is diabetes, hyperthyroid states and worms in the gut. All can keep you hungry 24x7. Blood tests to rule out diabetes and hyperthyroidism and stool test to rule out worms will be needed.So first take the blood pregnancy test and if negative consult your doctor to rule out the other causes. Take care!",

            "answer": "If you have taken several hpts, and they were negative, you are not pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0The previous poster is mistaken to say some women have a \"regular, routine period throughout the entire pregnancy.\"\u00a0\u00a0Some women do have bleeding when pregnant, but it is not a regular, routine period and wouldn't be anything that a woman would confuse for a regular period.\u00a0\u00a0Take care, you're unlikely to be pregnant with what you have described, it really is hard to fool home tests unless you didn't use first-morning urine.",
