            "answer": "So let me get this straight...you let people you don't know enter your house, draw blood with your needles, and then you used the SAME needles later? You were most definitely at risk if you do not know their status. This is exactly how IDU's transmit HIV (sharing needles). If you don't know their status, I'm not sure how this can be considered not at risk. Sorry to be blunt, man.",

    "question": "HelloI know what I did was stupid but please hear me out and advise...I have some vacutainer needles at my house. Sometimes when I want to do my diabetes test and I cant find the needles to draw blood I use those. Two days ago, some friend of mine where at my house and they were playing with one of those needles and poking themselves with them and they drew blood from one of the guys..then they put the cap back on and returned the needle to the drawer. Today, by mistake, I used the same needle to draw blood from my finger. Now I am petrefied and scared...was I at risk? I used the needle two days after my friends used it.....am I at risk? should I start PEP?",
