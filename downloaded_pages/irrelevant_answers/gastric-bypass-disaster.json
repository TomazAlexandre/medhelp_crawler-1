I can not give you much advice, but I do feel for you all.I was sad to read this, as I have a close friend who is considering this surgery.\u00a0\u00a0If you do not mind me asking how much did your sis-in-law weigh prior to surgery, including that 100lbs you say she lost already on her own? Was she physically active? or completely sedentary?\u00a0\u00a0What was her general health like before?\u00a0\u00a0It would seem to me that the surgeons did a poor job on her for sure, but you definitely investigate what was done wrong and consider a law suit, although I am sure her well being is the main thing on your mind.\u00a0\u00a0I am just so sick over these doctor's not taking responsibility for things going wrong.",

She was not in the greatest of health as she was having problems with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Part of her problem was, ash she admits, an addiction to food. My brother, bless his heart, went to all the classes with her including diabetes. He fixed her food and has been an incredible support for her.\u00a0\u00a0She was more sedintary due to her weight, which brought with it the shortness of breath and pain.\u00a0\u00a0I would tell anyone to seriously SERIOULSY research who would be doing this surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I work for Kaiser in Cal. They have developed a program that is less drastic. My boss just had the bypass and she is doing really well. Kaiser has continually observered and modified how they do these surgeries. If at all possible I would suggest going through them. Thanks for the support",

            "answer": "I predict that in a few years, gastric bypass will be all but gone from the horizon as lap-band is recognized for its superiority: complications such as that described above are all but absent, it's cheaper, the recovery is faster (most people can be done as outpatients) and over the long term, the weight loss is the same, and it's adjustable with a simple office procedure that takes less than a minute.",

Without losing the weight, their life-expectancy is greatly reduced. So for their health they need to lose it, whether by surgery or by dietary means alone.

            "answer": "Rinnie, First I'm sorry for all the distress this is causing you and your family. I had gastric by-pass surgery April 14, 2004. As of last night I've lost 115.5 lbs. I am 5'8\" and weighed 270 lbs. I had laproscopic surgery at Community Hosp. in New Port Richey under the care of Dr. Rudolph Dy. I've done everything they suggested, like support groups, which the hospital provides every other tuesday to anyone who has had this surgery. The third monday is open to all interested in learning about this surgery. They are going to be doing the lap band surgery soon. Everyone is different. Some can eat certain foods a couple weeks after surgery and others like me had to go slow and have liquid shakes. I started doing water aerobics in July and the weight started dropping 5 lbs a week. Plus I developed a great passion for swimming and I swim an extra hour or two three or four times a week. I bring my meals every where I go in case what's served isn't for me. I get regular blood tests and our hospital provides a top notch dietician once a month at their expense and she'll help anyone who has had the surgery no matter where they're from. The lap band yes is easier, But you have to follow this up with ajustments to the band. Just because it's easier doesn't mean it's better. And the surgeon who said the other way was history is so far out in right field it's a wonder he's a doctor still. He must have a great financial interest in the band. That is just my opinion. If you need to speak to someone from the hospital you can talk to Ms. Ivy Landell @ 727+845-9133 or email her at ivy.***@****. She can answer all your questions. I can't stress it enough to do what your doctor and their team tell you to do, have a support group, get regular blood tests and have a therapyst qualified in gastric by-pass surgery. Good luck and God Bless.",

            "answer": "Rinnie, I forgot to say I'm at my ideal weight of 154.5 lbs and I'm from Florida. Just north of Tampa. Please to all others thinking of having the surgery research it very well. You have to have your head and stomach in the right place and that's together. There will be foods you can go back to eating in small portions and others you can never have because they are what dragged you into the addiction of eating to much for whatever reason, like eating over emotions that couldn't be dealt with. Whether it's compulsive eating, gambling, drinking or sex or anything else what we needed, but couldn't do was deal with it for again whatever reason. I feel I don't want sugar or caffein in my diet because I can't handle it. I was given a gift of removing a monkey off my back that use to say give me more and more and more food and drink. I don't want that monkey on by back again so I stay away from it's little voice saying have just one little bite. That little bite like you'd give a child will possibly grow like a child grows and learns to eat larger portions. Guess I'm real talkative today. Hope some of this helps you or someone else out there.",

            "answer": "first, I have no economic interest in either: I'm retired. Second, I did not say gastric bypass doesn't work. It's very effective. It's just that when complications occur, they are disastrous; and with lap band, they are much rarer, and when they occur, it's typically a minor deal to take care of it. And the overall costs (not adding in those related to complications) favor lap band by several thousand dollars. Like nearly all innovations, the thing that comes first has a certain momentum that takes a while to overcome. Gastric bypass has been around longer than lap band. I didn't say bypass is history. I predicted that in a few years it will be, as the obvious benefits of lap band become evident, in terms of cost, safety, rapidity of recovery, etc. Nor, when I said those things, did I expect a personal attack and string of insults.",

I know I would probably lose faster with the bypass but the Lapband seems less complicated and potentially safer down the road...but I fear that I won't lose any weight on it. Can anyone help?

    "question": "My sis-in-law had gastric bypass surgery March 2005. She has not been able to hold down anything since then. She has had infections and problems continually since the surgery. Her doctors have given up claiming to have no idea why she is having these infections. They made her stomach too small, she had scar tissue blocking the stomach opening that needed to be removed, they found ulcers that needed repaired. She contracted a rare yeast infection that the CDC from Georgia came to investigate. She also had an infection that eventually went into \"the sac's around her spinal discs.\" She is now back in the hospital after 12 days of not being able to hold anything down. She is having a \"pick line\" replaced for at least the 2nd time since surgery due to infection and blockage.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was very over weight but lost almost 100 lbs before the surgery. She also suffered from diabetes. I believe she also has had a poor heart for some time.\u00a0\u00a0I realize this is not very descriptive but we are pretty desperate right now. We are afraid that she will die from this. Where can we go for help. She lives in Derby Kansas. Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
