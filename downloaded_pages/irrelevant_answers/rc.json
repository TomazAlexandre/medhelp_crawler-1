            "answer": "HI,Your situation is unique. My best recmmendation is that you seek out a consultation with a diabetes educator or nutritionist who is also familiar with GI disorders. You may still need some trial and error as well, but they are the best resource.In the meantime, try to stick with complex carbohydrates like beans and wheat bread if you can tolerate it. Lean meats and fish are excellent.Best of luck, take care.",
