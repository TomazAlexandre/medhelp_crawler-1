            "answer": "Did your doctor give you an upper limit to the basal dose? You also don't say if she still has you on oral meds, because it sounds like you have significant insulin resistance. I would talk to your doctor at this point, or better yet, ask for a referral to an endo. Your bg is dangerously high.",

            "answer": "\"She told me to inject 20 units just before bed, increasing it by 2 units each night until my morning fasting blood level is 120 or below.\"You know that age old adage \"doctors practice medicine\"? She is practicing on you instead of getting to the root cause of your high morning glucose [blood sugar]. I dislike doctors who will not take the time to diagnose a problem instead take the antiquated road of here take this pill and come back in two weeks.To inject 45 units and still have dangerously high morning levels over 300 indicates something in your Endocrine System is misfiring - pituitary gland, thyroid, pancreas, adrenal glands, immune system. This is beyond the scope of family or internal medicine. You need to see an expert. Please ask for a referral to a doctor of endocrinology - an Endocrinologist knows how to diagnose then properly treat extreme high/low glucose levels.Be sure to get copies of your medical records [by law its your given right]. Send them to the endocrinologist ahead of time so he/she is prepared for your arrival.",

It is a crisis but it also an opportunity. No, it is not too late, but you want to do everything you can to get your blood glucose down into target range. See an endo to get on the right insulin regimen. I can't believe your doctor told you to just keep upping your dose. My guess is you need to be on the standard basal (long-acting) and bolus (short acting before meals) regimen. Go back to the gym and plan your meals to reduce carb intake and help lower your post prandial numbers. You can do it!",
