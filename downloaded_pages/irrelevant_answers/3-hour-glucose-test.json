            "answer": "I just took my three hour about a week ago and failed. My sugar levels didn't drop enough in the second and third hour.Don't worry about it too much. I wasn't allowed to eat after midnight the night before and could drink water up to the test. I might with a specialist and dietician my obgyn set me up with at my hospital. The diet isn't that bad! You just have to find a variety of things you like to keep it interesting. They also prescribed a glucose monitor, lamcets, and strips. Even though you may have Go, it doesn't mean your baby will be 10 pounds. If you stick to a healthy diet no matter what you should be okay. Good luck!",

            "answer": "i failed the three hour and i freaked and blamed myself for a solid week. once i got educated on the subject and realized it had nothing to do with anything i did or didn't do (i had zero risk factors) and its just like alot of things in pregnancy it just happens with all the drastic hormonal changes. Anyway to the point diagnosed at 29 wks have been able to manage it with diet and exercise alone (yay) And at my 36wks ultrasound baby was weighing in at 6.9 lbs which is the 53rd percentile which is a completely normal weight. dont have to be induced early and baby should weight about 8 or 8.5 at term. so if its well managed you dont have to worry about a big baby. and even if your baby is ten pounds you can do it! ;)",
