            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine you and obtain a history, I can not tell you what your symptoms are from. However, I will try to provide you with some information.Your symptoms are very unusual, and at least difficult to determine based on what you describe.I am not sure neither if they have a neurologic basis or if there are caused by other conditions.Regarding problems swallowing and sensation of \u201cesophagus restricting airflow\u201d. This could be related to esophageal spasms, which is an esophageal motility disorder, usually diagnosed with esophageal manometry or sometimes even with esophagogram or endoscopy. This condition could be isolated, or associated with other conditions, such as inflammatory disorders, neuropathies, diabetes, esophageal reflux disease to mention some. The treatment is initially focused on the underlying cause if there is one, and symptomatic treatment. Sometimes autonomic disorders could be associated with problems in gastrointestinal motility, and an underlying neurologic disorder could be the culprit. It is important to find out if there are other manifestations of autonomic disorders, such as dizziness with changes in position, problems with sensation and sweating, or heart rate variability.For problems with gastrointestinal motility, sometimes manifested as \u201cdistended stomach\u201d, and usually referred as early satiety, these could be associated with neuropathies or autonomic disorders as well. A gastric emptying study may be helpful if there is suspicion for gastric dysmotility.I am not sure what you mean by tiredness in the eyes. There are multiple conditions that can cause eye symptoms, including muscular problems and problems in neuromuscular junction or the nerves that \u201cactivate\u201d the eye muscles. The pattern is unusual as you describe these coming every 3-4 days. Based on your information I cannot correlate your symptoms with the neck movement.Before being able to treat your symptoms, it will be important to find out what the cause is. As I told you, without being able to examine you and obtain a detailed history, I cannot tell you what you have. I think you should see a neurologist and find out if any of your symptoms have a neurologic basis, and probably consider an evaluation by gastroenterology if it is thought to be necessary by your physicians.I hope this information is useful. Good luck.",
