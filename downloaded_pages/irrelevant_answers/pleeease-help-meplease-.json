            "answer": "There is a condition called gastroparesis where the stomach gets bloated/distended after eating even a small amount of food.\u00a0\u00a0Constipation can also be a problem with it.\u00a0\u00a0Also, nausea and vomiting sometimes and almost always pain or at least discomfort after eating.\u00a0\u00a0It basically means the stomach doesn't empty as fast as it should so the food piles up in there.\u00a0\u00a0Have your mom ask her gastroenterologist or PCP about it and see what they think.\u00a0\u00a0It is diagnosed by a gastric emptying scan in nuclear medicine.\u00a0\u00a0Basically you sit under this scanner after eating eggs and milk with radioactive tracer in them and they take pictures to see how fast the food and liquids are leaving the stomach.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes people have this alone and sometimes in concert with other conditions, especially diabetes, but many others as well-neurologic disease, rheumatologic disease, thyroid disease, damage to the vagus nerve after stomach surgery, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I have this condition so if you want to ask questions, ask and I will checkback.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you.\u00a0\u00a0If your mom has it she should eat small meals often (not big meals), eat low-fat and low-fiber (or put high-fiber foods in blender to make liquid or soft), and there are a few meds that are used to move the food through more quickly.\u00a0\u00a0But she should ask her doctor about it first.",

            "answer": "i have gastroparesis and her symptoms sound like they could fit this diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0i will sometimes get the \"bump\" you're describing.\u00a0\u00a0it's really freaky to see your stomach balloon out like that.\u00a0\u00a0she needs to see a gastroenterologist.\u00a0\u00a0a prinary care doctor is NOT good enough for this situation.\u00a0\u00a0i'd encourage her to keep a detailed food diary also that notes symptoms as they relate to what she eats.\u00a0\u00a0the gastric emptying scan is not that bad.\u00a0\u00a0it sucks to eat microwaved radioactive egg whites (NOT that tastiest meal i've ever had, to say the least!) but it is a great diagnostic tool.\u00a0\u00a0she may also need an endoscopy to take a look inside. i had my GES and my endoscopy done the same week and based on those results, my doctor diagnosed me with a mild form of GP.",

    "question": "i know this is long, but i am in need of help and i am worried.my mom is having some problems. she eats something little and her stomache looks like shes pregnant right after food. she eats healthy, walks cardio for an hour everyday. she is 49 years old. 120 lbs. shes 5'3 her height. she is in pretty good shape. but she just started going to a heart doctor just to get a check up and he put her on a fish diet because of high cholestral runs in her family. she eats like five bites of fish or anything else and her stomache ends up looking like shes 7 months pregnant . what can this be? once in a while she gets constipated. and last week she went to a pelvic ultrasound and they told her that her uterus is waaay too high up. could that all relate? could she be allergic to fish? but she gets like that no matter what she eats. she is starting to worry about cancer and tumor and stuff because of all that. any ideas? please write back. thank you",
