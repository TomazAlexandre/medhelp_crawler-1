            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Diagnosis of diabetes is through blood testing for your blood sugar levels. Though your symptoms are suggestive of diabetes, it is important to have evidence-based medicine. Tumor headache is unlikely because it usually presents with pain that progressively worsens, vomiting, possible visual disturbances speech or personality changes; problems with equilibrium, gait, or coordination and even seizures.It is best that you see your doctor and have diagnostic tests for proper evaluation. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "This is hard for me to say but i am very overweight. I am 265 pounds at 16! I think i have diabetes because i get dizzy sometimes and i get tingling in my fingers and toes.. and i almost bottomed out 2 days ago! i had to take 2 spoon fulls of sugar to recover. Also im having headaches that feel like pressure,hot and they radiate through my sinuses sometimes. they also go to the back of my head. I have dark skin around my crotch and underbelly area and im white!!! sometimes my hands and feet ache and get really tight too. Also ive been having short term memory loss but it kinda feels like a brain fart. I have not had any seizures or visual disturbances besides flashes and floaters But thats explained i have kertaconus.\u00a0\u00a0the head ache is Most of the time on the right side of my head and sometimes moves to the left and its the SAME EXACT spot as the right! I think it MAYBE sinuses because i wake up EVERYDAY with a stuffy nose. Also when i wake up i feel like my head is sore. that goes away after about an hour. Also i have allergies and that maybe a factor. I NEED ADVICE!! I don't want to die! i want to live to see my little brother graduate from high school!!!!!",
