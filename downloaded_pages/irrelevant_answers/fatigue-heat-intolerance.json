So currently they are testing me for Lupus and Multiple Sclerosis. Also it was mentioned that Fybromyalgia may be a possibility. I don't have a definative diagnosis yet. Would like to add I've already been tested for Diabetes and Thyroid conditions and they have both come back normal.\u00a0\u00a0I have Endometriosis (in my case, this is the reason for the constipation/ diarrhea)Hope this helps.",

    "question": "Hi new poster here..\u00a0\u00a0For awhile on and off I have been experiencing a variety of symptoms, and I don't know why.\u00a0\u00a0FYI I'm a 23 yr old female, definitely not pregnant.Some of the main symptoms...-Major fatigue - I have a lot of trouble getting up in the morning, even if I got a good 8 hrs or so of sleep.\u00a0\u00a0I also am always tired throughout the day, at times almost feeling like I am going to fall asleep.-Heat sensitivity- Especially when I am indoors these days, I almost always feel really warm.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone else will be comfortable in sweatshirts, and I'll be in a T-shirt and uncomfortably warm-Lightheadness- I eat regular meals, and have small snacks throughout the day, but I often get that lightheaded feeling like I need to eat or need sugar or something even if I just ate an hour or so ago.-Loss of appetite- not all the time, and though it may seem like its related to the previous symptom, I don't think it since sometimes I experience one w/o the other.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't seem to be related to how much I eat, sometimes it feels like food is just sitting in the top of my stomach and I have no appetite at all.-Muscle soreness/stiffness- primarily in my back and neck.\u00a0\u00a0Also my arms seem really tired lately, like it almost feels like its weight lifting when I have my hands up on the steering wheel.-Also I have had pretty frequent headaches, constipation/diarrea, and I am almost always thirsty.\u00a0\u00a0And I am not sure if its related or not, but I find that I've had a lot of difficulty concentrating.I've had the thirst and fatigue systems (though not as bad) in the past, so I was tested for diabetes and some thyroid conditions earlier in the year, but they all came back negative.\u00a0\u00a0I did some reading on adrenal fatigue and some of the symptoms seem to match, but does anybody have any other opinions on what some of this could be.",
