            "answer": "Perhaps why its called phenomenon, something that occurs out of the ordinary and may vary per individual, where in your case one drink at bedtime raises your glucose levels. This may be caused by the sugar in alcohol, little as it may be its still present.The jury is still out on DP and there's a lot of psuedo scientific material on the net. Mendosa, who has positive reports,http://www.mendosa.com/blog/?p=232 , says the opposite, that it lowers. So who knows?",

    "question": "I'm type 2 diabetic. I have been taking Metformin 500mg 1 tablet a day for the last 3 years. My A1C is in control (6.0).It appears that I am hitting so called \"dawn phenonmenon\" whenever I drink alcohol (just 1 drink). Before going to bed my blood sugar is about 110 whether I drink alcohol or not. But my fasting glucose is between 140 and 150 if I drink alcohol and it is from 115 to 125 if I don't consume any alcohol the previous night.In summary the dawn phenomenon is exasperated by alcohol. But every thing I am reading is against this.I'm wondering if any one has any logical explanation for this.",
