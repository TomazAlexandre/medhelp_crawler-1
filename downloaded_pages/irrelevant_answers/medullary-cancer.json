            "answer": "Get a surgeon with plenty of experience in thyroid surgery. Thyroid cancer has a higher cure rate than most other cancers, so better your odds with the best surgeon you can find.This doc has an excellent history but he's in Texas:www.thyroidcancer.comFor post-operation, you will need a good endo, who specializes in thyroid, not diabetes. This site also lists some surgeons.http://www.thyroid-info.com/topdrs/Best of luck to you!:) Tamra",

            "answer": "I was diagnosed with MTC about 2 months ago. By the time all the tests were done, i had another thyroid cancer surgeon tell me it's not coming from my thyroid. He said it was coming from my lung and sent me to see a lung specialist. My original oncologist said he doesn't agree and it doesn't make sense to him so on Thursday, i'm going to Mayo clinic in Jacksonville, FL to meet with another thyroid expert. I feel for you! Nobody seems to be able to tell me for sure what this is. How did you get diagnosed with MTC? Was it an ultrasound or a biopsy, etc?",
