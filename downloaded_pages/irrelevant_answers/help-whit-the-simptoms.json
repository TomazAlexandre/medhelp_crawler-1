            "answer": "Hi There,It is difficult to give an opinion without a good clinical exam and evaluating the test results.It is important to rule out peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes, B12 deficiency, Thyroid dysfunction, Lymes disease, and fibromyalgia.It is important to know what treatment you are currently on. You can start with B12 supplements and see if they help in controlling these symptoms.Hope this helps!",
