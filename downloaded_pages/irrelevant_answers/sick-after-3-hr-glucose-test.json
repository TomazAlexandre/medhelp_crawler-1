My doctor ordered a little bit easier test, I just had to fast then go get blood drawn then go eat a big breakfast and go back two hours later. Definitely easier lol I for sure thought I had gestational diabetes after trying that three hour one, but I passed! :-) so good luck hopefully your test results come back normal :-)",
