            "answer": "What it may mean is that you are pre-diabetic. Anything over 100 qualifies for that definition. If you are prediabetic you would have hyperglycemia as well as hypoglycemia. What did your doctor suggest about the results? Might be useful to have another test such as an OGTT to measure your bodies response to sugar or an A1C to get your overall average blood sugar for a three month period.",

            "answer": "I would not be concerned about hypoglycemia if your glucose levels do not drop below 70 mg/dl. However, your 102 mg/dl is a head shaker. This reading indicates you're headed towards hyperglycemia [type 2] land unless you undertake the necessary prevented steps below.\"I have always suffered from hypoglycemic attacks (increased pulse rate, dizziness, shaking, etc.) when I go too long without eating.\"This can apply to a lot of people as it depends on your physical activity and how fast your body utilizes/burns off energy. To help maintain a balance try to eat small portions throughout the day. Junk food does not count.Simple steps to help prevent type 2 diabetes:1. If overweight, lose it and maintain normal weight. Just a bit over doesn't cut the cake [no pun].2. Eat properly; no junk foods, avoid refined sugars, avoid bad carbs. Eat healthy.3. Physical exercise; park at the far end and walk to the store entrance, etc.4. Practice stress management.5. Get proper amounts of sleep.You were tested, got bad results but do not mention if the attending doctor discussed diabetes and diabetes prevention with you. If he/she didn't, Google it!",

            "answer": "Thanks so much for responding! My doctor simply said that we need to keep an eye on my glucose levels. We're dealing with another situation right now that's made itself a priority (been running a fever for months - having tons of tests done).Anyway, I am in the healthy weight range for my height and walk two miles a day. I'm careful about what I eat and avoid sugar because it makes me feel bad.I guess I just wanted to know if I could have both hypo and hyperglycemia and it makes sense that hypoglycemia would correlate with my eating habits and exercise (I go way too long without eating sometimes and I'm working on that).Anyway, that you guys for all of the information, and I'll definitely continue taking steps to avoid diabetes!Thanks, all!",

            "answer": "Actually all types of diabetes, Type 1, Type 2 and LADA/Type 1.5 can entail both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, it's kind of the nature of the beast. And when you treat diabetes with insulin, oral meds and even diet and exercise it can exacerbate these extremes. The key is to try and balance your blood sugar so it avoids both extreme. Hypoglycemia is uncomfortable and if severe, dangerous. Hyperglycemia leads to complications.",

Quite speedy, in fact faster than the WiFi offered at the Harbor Reef restaurant on shore.I have questions about your last post.\"Actually all types of diabetes, Type 1, Type 2 and LADA/Type 1.5 can entail both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, it's kind of the nature of the beast.\"How so? Please explain. As a type 2, I have never experienced hypoglycemia, ever.\"And when you treat diabetes with insulin, oral meds and even diet and exercise it can exacerbate these extremes.\"Sure, if one OD's by ingesting too much orals or injecting too much insulin will glucose levels drop below normal levels. The objective is to bring your glucose to a normal range, not below it.Depending on the diet and exercise it may or may not exacerbate the condition but not with orals or insulin. I can see your statement applying to Lada's, or with type 1.5'ers, but not type 1 or 2's.",

            "answer": "Hi liberty---I am a medical doctor who is focused on alternative and integrative medicine.I wanted to tell you that a\u00a0\u00a0glucose of 102 is NOT indicative of diabetes nor does it suggest that you are at risk for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Glucose levels >120 are concerning and should prompt your doctor to re-check and/or obtain a Hemoglobin A1C which will provide a reading of your average glucose over the past 3 months.With regard to having hypoglycemic episodes and this lab test not finding that---- these episodes are transient and thus it's rare that a lab reading will show <70.\u00a0\u00a0However, you might try a 2 hour oral glucose load test which could reveal this underlying issue whereby you drink lots of sugar on an empty stomach and then get a repeat blood sugar/glucose reading at 1 and 2 hours--- you will feel horrible (at least I did and many of my patients do) but it will unmask and reveal this issue if you have it... hope this helps!!Dr Brad",

            "answer": "Wow, lots of information on here :-)I understand that 102 is not very high and I think that's why my doctor only said we should keep an eye on it in the future. I was just really surprised that it was even that high because I always thought that I typically had low blood sugar. I feel like it's just another reason to avoid sugar and other unhealthy foods - something I've been trying to do anyway - and make sure that I eat good foods often enough.But it doesn't seem like an urgent situation to me. I don't feel like it warrants more tests or my doctor would have ordered them (he's very conscientious). What do you guys think? Doesn't it sound like something I can manage with diet for now?You guys have been awesome - thanks for all the responses and information. It really means a lot to me to get some advice. Anyone else have anything to add (or warn me about)?",

            "answer": "Posting from a sailboat...I think he's trying to make us all jealous...lolMy understanding is that hypoglycemia is a lot more common in Type 1's and 1.5's but not unheard of in Type 2's. Many Type 2's never experience it at all especially if they are vigilent about eating regularly and not engaging in extreme exercise without sufficient nutrition. But many do experience occasional bouts of mild hypoglycemia. (50s or 60s). Oral meds are not as much an exact science as one would hope and many people are tried out on different meds and doses and then others are added in as the situation changes. In this process there is room for error and if people make other changes like increasing exercise or lowering carb intake that also comes into the equation.Type 1's on the other hand experience much more in the way of both highs and lows and keeping blood sugar in target range is a constant effort for many. Type 1.5's as you say, have the most difficult time managing blood sugar because their own pancreas is still producing insulin and sometimes does so in spurts making insulin doses difficult to determine consistently.It would be nice if insulin dosing were an exact science, but it isn't. Many doctors prescribe a set dose for meals which is almost a guarantee of erratic blood sugars. Even using the most up to date system of carb counting and different I:C ratios for each meal there is no guarantee of perfect results. Many Type 1's report if they are high for one meal during the day it sets off a response where the spike generates a related low and they then use correction doses which are also difficult to get exactly right and often yo-yo all day. Many people also seem to over-treat lows and then go high. Etc, etc.My understanding was that any fasting over 100 is considered pre-diabetic. But I think you are absolutely right on libertyforlife in saying that this should be handled by attention to diet and exercise and just keeping an eye on the blood sugar. Many people aren't even aware when they are in the pre-diabetic range and it is a great opportunity to keep things from progressing. Best of luck to you!",

            "answer": "I wish you could edit these posts. I didn't mean to say people use correction doses when they were low, but that they use them when they are high which is another opportunity to get it right or not. Probably TMI, but just wanted to include all the variables that can affect blood sugar goals with insulin. Many people also see evidence of influence on bg by stress, illness, and even high temps. Then there are the times it seems like the position of the stars and the cost of tea in china..lol",
