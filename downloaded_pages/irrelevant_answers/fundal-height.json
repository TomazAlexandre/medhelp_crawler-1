            "answer": "Mine is spot on, last pregnancy though it was six weeks ahead, ultrasound revealed excess amniotic fluid. I was monitored and given ultrasounds every 4 weeks. Baby was delivered 3 weeks early and apart from low blood sugars he was perfectly fine. A few feeds later his sugar was normal. I'd definatley ask for another us at this point. Have you had a gestational diabetes test yet? Sometimes gestational diabetes can cause larger than normal fundal heights as babies can be bigger and more amniotic fluid.",

            "answer": "She did an ultrasound the same day and only one baby in there. It would be something if I go to deliver and have 2 which would be crazy cause yes that means it would have been three. I do a lot of weekly reading and I can say from my readings and the ultrasound tech also said so my baby is measuring a little big. My fiance keeps saying at first when I told him it was twins but may have lost one he didn't know how to feel because this is his 6th child and we have a set of twins already but now he always say he wish the other baby would have made it. I already have medical conditions so I am just concerned about having a good pregnancy.",

    "question": "Hey everybody. I was wondering if anybody fundal height is measuring more than their weeks. Last week mine was measuring 32 and I was just turning 24 weeks. The doctor is suppose to elaborate more on it next week when I go back. I read this normally happens during a twin pregnancy but I lost one of my twins around the 6th week. My sister says that the doc could be wrong and I have a twin hiding behind my son.",
