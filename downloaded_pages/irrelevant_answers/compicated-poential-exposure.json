    "question": "I'm worried about a potential blood exposure and was hoping someone knowledgeable could give me an opinion about whether it constitutes a risk. I can't stop thinking about it!I was working at a first aide booth at a charity run. A girl came up with very bloody knees from scraping them on the gravel. I put on gloves and helped clean her up. I washed most of the blood off and but betadine on her knees. I took one of my gloves of to reach for and open another gauze square, dampened it, then (without thinking) pressed it to her wound with my bare hand.I did have an \"open wound\" on one of these fingers, in the form of a finger-stick hole for blood sugar testing (type I diabetes). This prick was 3 hours prior or so, wasn't bleeding, and wasn't even visible. After squeezing incessantly at it I was able to get a tiny drop of blood out, though.Do you think this tiny fingerprick wound exposed to water that probably had some minutes amounts of blood, sucked up through gauze, constitutes an exposure?Also, I'm kind of afraid to get a rapid antibody test, because I heard that autoimmune conditions can cause a high rate of false positive results and I've got both type 1 diabetes and Hashimoto's thyroiditis.Thanks. Really worried.",
