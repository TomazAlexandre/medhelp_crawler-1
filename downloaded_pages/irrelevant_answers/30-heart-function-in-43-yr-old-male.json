            "answer": "I believe the term you're looking for is Congestive Heart Failure.\u00a0\u00a0However, it usually includes swelling from the abdomen to the feet, with occassional fluid in the lungs, making it hard to breathe.It can be managed with Coreg, lasix, and a host of other BP meds, but it is usually chronic.Your boyfriend can get along at 30% for years if he follows a heart friendly diet, gets as much exercise as he can handle, and takes the medication a doctor would prescribe.\u00a0\u00a0Of course there are no guarantees, but none of us get a guarantee on how long we're going to live, ill or not.I've been living with an EF of 15-20 % for about 3 years, and there are others, on this bulletin, who are living with 5% and have been for longer than myself.So, he needs to see a doctor, be tested again, get the meds, and do what the doctor tells him, and he just may do very well.I hope the best for both of you.",

            "answer": "Nightsweats seem to be part of CHF(my doctor also calls it Cardio Myopathy)...and it doesn't always have to happen at night.\u00a0\u00a0I sleep in front of a fan every night, that way, if I start the nightsweats, I just throw back the blankets and wait for it to pass. Of course most women learn the \"fan\" trick when they enter into menopause, which is where I learned it.None of my doctors, and there are A LOT of them, seem concerned about the problems with nightsweats, as long it isnt' accompanied by pain in the jaw, left arm, chest or between my shoulder blades.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is indicative of a heart attack and needs attention ASAP.Since your boyfriend has done alcohol, drugs and cigarettes, his body might be trying to get rid of the toxins that have built up in his body over the years.\u00a0\u00a0However, I've seen many people who are trying to give up alcohol go through terrible sweating, shaking, and being physically ill.\u00a0\u00a0I can't imagine giving up everything at the same time....it has to be hard on his body.I didn't have to give up anything, except food, and I've gone through all kinds of bouts with sweating, so who knows what causes it.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!What you are probably talking about is an ejection fraction of 30%. I would suggest you get him to go for an immediate cardiac check up with cardiac enzymes, EKG and ECHO. An implantable cardiac debrillator (ICD) helps improve the heart function when ejection fraction is less than 35%. Ejection fraction is usually measured by echocardiography. Yes subjective errors are possible. However if in doubt other methods can be employed such as cardiac MRI, MUGA scan, ventriculography, and a CT scan. Of these ventriculography is the gold standard for ejection fraction calculation.Sweating can be due to compromised hear function, adrenal gland problems, diabetes, thyroid problems etc. All these can compromise the heart function further. A heart patient should lose weight only under supervision and nothing should be tried on your own.Cardiomyopathies are of several types. Both dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be associated with conduction effects, though the defects are more in HCM. Coxsackie virus causes viral myocarditis, which can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure.\u00a0\u00a0In contrast to dilated cardiomyopathies, hypertrophic cardiomyopathies have a better prognosis. HCM can be both genetic and acquired. The acquired form is generally seen in elderly due to high blood pressure. At times like in DCM, the cause is not known. However there is always a strong genetic component. In patients with alcohol induced cardiomyopathy may improve dramatically and remain in remission simply by abstaining from alcohol. Other underlying treatable causes like diabetes etc yield a better prognosis.Please consult a cardiologist and get a complete check up and proper treatment.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
