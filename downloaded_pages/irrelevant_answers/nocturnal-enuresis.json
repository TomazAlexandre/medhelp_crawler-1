            "answer": "Hi,How frequent are these episodes?Do you experience this each night?Do you experience increase in urinary frequency in the mornings or do you only have the symptoms at night?Any associated pain in urination?Any sensation of residual urine after urination?Do you experience intermittent leaking of urine during the day when doing certain tasks or activities?I do suggest that you have a complete assessment done by your internist ( your joint stiffness may also be assessed).A urology referral will be able to help.One has to rule out systemic causes like diabetes and hypertension.A urinalysis and urodynamic studies will help identify the underlying cause.Menopause may be associated with incontinence due to the decreased level of estrogen in the body.So this may largely explain your symptoms.Estrogen do\u00a0\u00a0have an effect on the bladder wall.At this point,\u00a0\u00a0the primary differential is an incontinence.As to what type of incontinence,your urologist will be able to help with the diagnosis after a complete medical history.",

            "answer": "thank you for your reply. This was a once off episode. I don't have pain or residual urine after urination but i do have a bit of leakage when I hang on too long. The usual pattern is: I get an urge, very strong, but I avoid going to the toilet as there will usually be a small amount. the urge goes away and I am fine for some time then a repeat of the above. eventually I push my luck and can sometimes suffer a bit of leakage. This can happen anytime of the day. Usually not at night because I am home and don't bother with hanging on for too long. i don't usually have problems when sneezing, coughing or lifting. What happened to me that night was so weird, it made me think back to my early childhood. I was a bedwetter and it is like a part of my brain must have been switched off that normally isn't when sleeping.",

    "question": "something awful happened to me tonight. i wet the bed. I went to the toilet before bed, which was after 10 and then went again during the night and at 2 woke to find my sheets were wet. I did not have any urge and when i got up and went to the toilet I did a reasonable amount. I feel shocked and frightened as recently I have developed stiffness in the joints of my hands every morning and i feel my well being, in spite of my utmost care, is getting beyond my control. Yesterday, I was a little worried about my bladder as I seemed to need to go more than I should have. i am 53 years old, post-menopausal and am trying to sort out natural ways of dealing with menopausal symptoms. I take a range of vitamins, maca powder and a natural progest e oil. I have tried to make contact with a compounding pharmacist to get pregnenelone prescribed but havent heard back from him. ever since this arthritic feeling began I have been floundering around not really knowing what to do. But now this. thanks for any advice you can give me.This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/224820\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/224820</a>.",
