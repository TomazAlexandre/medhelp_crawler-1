            "answer": "Well, I don't know all the ins and outs of cholesterol numbers,but I suspect that you have a bigger autoimmune metabolic issue overall.\u00a0\u00a0In my case, I believe the high bad cholesterol that just showed up, end of my 50's and the type 2 diabetes that showed up just 5 years prior ... are both birth defects of my dad's WWII Navy exposure to 2-butoxyethanol or similar chemical.I know you won't hear this from anyone else.\u00a0\u00a0I am dead serious.\u00a0\u00a0The epidemic that our world ... especially USA, Britain and Europe is seeing in this time ... could be directly linked to exposures of our ancestors to the bomb fumes and cleaners that became extremely prevalent in those WWII days ... and continuing to this very day.Warnings are inadequate.\u00a0\u00a0But many products we use in our households are unsafe.\u00a0\u00a0See if there were the signs in anyone in your family ... even in yourself ... that would be CFS, FM or Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome.And if I'm right, as I firmly believe I am, the help offerred is like putting a bandaid on a dam leak:\u00a0\u00a0near hopeless.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to follow the suggestions of Roger J.

The common name for the acid is myristoleic acid. Myristoleic acid is found commonly in fish oils, whale oils, dairy butter, and kombo butter. The chemical formula for cetyl myristoleate is (Z)-ROCO(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)3CH3.It is not known to be toxic.\u00a0\u00a0As a dietary supplement - taken in large doses, it may alter lipid metabolism. Inform your doctor.Of more importance may be your use of Lipitor. Take the time to acquaint yourself with the various problems associated with Lipitor use and note in these same sources the argument that there IS NO study demonstrating high blood cholesterol causes heart disease.",
