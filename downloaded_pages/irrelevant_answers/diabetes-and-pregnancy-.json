            "answer": "hello,if you are wanting to have a successful pregnancy the most important thing you can do is to have excellent blood sugar control.Ideally your Hba1c will be < 6.0.This can be done by carefully adjusting your insulin doses and combine with eating a low carb diet (the low carb will reduce your insulin requirements and thus also protect you from going too low or high).I recommend the book diabetes solutions by Dr. Richard Bernstein.\u00a0\u00a0HE describes how to get excellent control using insulin and lwo carb diet.\u00a0\u00a0Even if you don't end up going as low carb as he recommends, you can still use what he teachers and a lower carb approach to get good control.",
