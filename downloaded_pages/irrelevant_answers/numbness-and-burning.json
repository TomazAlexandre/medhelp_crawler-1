            "answer": "Hi,Your distribution of pain, numbness and tingling are like glove and stocking distribution of nerve dysfunction.Pain, tingling and numbness are suggestive of neuropathy. This type of neuropathy could be due to Nutritional deficiency.There are lots of other causes of neuropathy like to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.In your case it appears to be due to Vitamin B12 deficiency. I think you should be consulting your PCP for further evaluation and reference for neurologist as early as possible. As the recognition of disease is easy and so is the treatment hence early visit to doctor would help you recover faster.Hope this helps.Bye.",

            "answer": "Hi,Congratulations to you on your recovery.Are you an alcoholic? If that is the case then may be it would have been temporary phase.If that is due to nerve compression due to momentarily sleeping on it, hence it would have improved.Keep me posted if you have symptoms again.We would try to find a cause and try to address the issue.Bye.",

            "answer": "No I'm not an alcoholic but I've been very sick the past few days and still am. I've had fevers on and off, I'm very conjested, I've had horrible migraine headaches, food tastes dull, and I've been having leg, back, and abdominal muscle pain.I've been taking tylonal and antibiotics for all that.I haven't been eating a lot since getting sick I've had at most 4000 calories over a 4 day period. I've been laying in bed a lot too sleeping almost entire days.The numbness in my fingers was just a very unwelcome addition to everything else bothering me. It could have been slept on and maybe that caused it. That's what I thought it was at first but then it lasted all day and I wasn't so sure. Also last night I happened to check my blood sugar. I stuck my index finger on both hands and noticibly less blood came out of the numb finger. My blood sugar was 85 by the way which is normal.Also my hand now just feels like it's asleep a lot espesually if I lay on my right side. It still feels much better than it did yesterday though.",

    "question": "My 3rd toe is numb and when I touch it I feel a burning sensation. It's been like this for weeks.Also just this morning in my right hand my index, middle, and ring fingers including my thumb are numb and tingle when I touch the tips but burn when I touch lower than the tips. My pinky is fine though oddly.Will this ever go away and what might be the cause?",
