            "answer": "Neuropathy numbness pain in arms and legs can be referred pain from the spine.\u00a0\u00a0Lack of Vitamin B group especially B12 - a blood test would show if the Vitamin B12 levels are low.Another reason for neuropathy numbness can be from nerve damage from uncontrolled sugar levels with someone who has diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0An HbA1C blood test would show your average blood glucose levels over a period of 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor can also arrange for you to have a glucose test to find out if you have glucose intolerance.\u00a0\u00a0Even before diabetes is confirmed, damage can happen to nerves.Loose stools can be a medical symptom, but also can be related to what you eat and drink.\u00a0\u00a0If you drank a lot of fresh orange juice, for example, that would give you loose stools.Make an appointment to see your doctor to get those blood tests that I mentioned above and ask about getting nerve conduction tests done to see if there is any impingement on nerves in the spine.",

I took prednisone for asthma and it started after that I have read this wouldn't cause neuropathy but I just got another round yesterday and immediately the pain has came back twice as bad it has been kept at bay until I took this.",

            "answer": "Vitamin B12 is a water soluble vitamin, this means that any excess that is taken in the day, will be excreted when you go to urinate.I know exactly what you mean by feeling like you are wasting the doctor's time.As you took/used the prednisone and your symptoms came back - this medication is not suiting you.\u00a0\u00a0I too have a problem in that I cannot take some medications due to having adverse side effects.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest to keep off the prednisone and tell your doctor of your reaction to it.You should make an appointment to see your doctor to discuss the results of the elevated liver function - this may be due to some medications that you are on.Keep a note of how you get on with the Lyrica.\u00a0\u00a0This medication also goes under the name of Pregabalin.\u00a0\u00a0It is used for treating pain caused by neurologic diseases such as postherpetic neuralgia as well as seizures.\u00a0\u00a0If it does not help you, you will need to get\u00a0\u00a0back to your own doctor if you have been discharged by the Neuro.Best wishes.",
