It was def my toenail because as my toenail grew, the discoloration of the nail grew as well. Evenly,\u00a0\u00a0my toenail grew out along with the discoloration. Does your toenail bleach when you press on it?\u00a0\u00a0I don't believe melanoma will blanch.",

            "answer": "It's not cancer. It is a small blood clot caused by stubbing your toe. You have to watch these closely because they can become infected and cause loss of a toe and osteomyelitis. The best way is to use a digital camera on close up to photograph it every day.next to a ruler. If you have diabetes you should watch your sugar and don't hesitate to go to a podiatrist.",

    "question": "I really can't tell if it's under the skin, on it, etc. I just noticed it when I was clipping my toe nails. It's like right below the nail bed on my skin there. It's just a brownish/blackish dot and I'm not sure what it is. I'm not sure how long it's been there either as I don't clip my toenails often - they grow super slow. I'm not too worried about skin cancer because I know that usually appears under the nail, not on the skin. But I don't really know what to do either. Should I just wait to see if it goes away?",
