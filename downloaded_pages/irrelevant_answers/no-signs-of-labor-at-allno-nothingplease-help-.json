    "question": "I'm 36 weeks and i have no signs that my body is preparing for labor. No Braxton Hicks at all, no mucus plug coming out, no nothing. I'd think that I'm having false contractions then it would turn put to be just gas. The only thing that has changed is I'm pooping more often and that's just about it. My doctor hasn't checked to see if I'm dilating yet but i go again this Thursday so hopefully she'll check. Most likely I'll be getting a c section so would i have to be dilated for that? I'll be 37 weeks this Sunday. Is it normal that I'm not experiencing these things? Should i be worried?",
