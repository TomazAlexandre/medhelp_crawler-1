            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Normally the urine does not contain blood cells but might contain a trace of protein. The presence of protein in urine is not related to blood in urine.Blood in urine might occur due to infection to glomerulus, stones in the urinary tract and some urinary tract infections. Where as presence of protein indicates damages to the tubular apparatus of the nephron. Proteinuria can be present in cases of nephrotic syndrome, kindney failure, pyuria, chronic infections etc.Both the symptoms occur due to damaging two different parts of the nephron, but these symptoms can occur simultaneously.It is a serious condition and would require immediate evaluation and treatment.All the best.",

            "answer": "HiThere are multiple causes of blood in urine like\u00a0\u00a0viral infections, inflammation of the kidney, medications,\u00a0\u00a0benign prostate enlargement, cancers, trauma, stones, infections, and obstructions of the urinary tract.Increase in urine protein in small amounts is rarely a cause for concern and may be due to fever, heavy exercise. Large amounts of protein in the urine may indicate a kidney problem, and diabetes.The presence of blood and protein in urine can occur separately, but since they both present in urine, it requires urgent medical attention. You should consult a doctor for a complete urine analysis and kidney function tests like serum creatinine and creatinine clearance.Take care",

    "question": "Hopefully, this is a very easy question.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know that if the amount of blood in urine effects the amount of protein?\u00a0\u00a0I'm still trying to find out why I have so much blood in my urine and am seeing another urologogist in a few weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I have been monitoring my urine with 10-Parameter test strips. The last few days I have had a lot of blood in my urine (looks like diluted Heinz ketchup).\u00a0\u00a0Whereas everything else (except for high specific gravity) was ok previously, the protein has showed from + to ++.\u00a0\u00a0If this due to there being more blood?\u00a0\u00a0Many thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read and/or respond.\u00a0\u00a0Terri",
