            "answer": "Hi!I agree with your doctors. The finding of \u2018some minor cerebral small vessel disease\u2019 can be age related or due to thyroid disorders, high cholesterol, diabetes, high BP etc if you suffer from it. There is no immediate threat. However, this can progress in a person suffering from above mentioned conditions, if they are not kept in control. If it is just age related, then keep your brain alert by eating healthy, going for walks, reading, playing brain games etc. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your comment. This helps a lot and is consistent with what my GP told me yesterday. My blood pressure reading was high so it is going to be monitored. I had been reading on the internet about cerebral small vessel disease and frightening myself with fears of impending stroke, dementia, etc. I'm very grateful for your reassuring comment.",

    "question": "My brain CT scan 'showed only some minor cerebral small vessel disease in keeping with her age.' I am 63. My neurologist and GP does not seem worried about this, but it sounds scary to me. Should I be worried?",
