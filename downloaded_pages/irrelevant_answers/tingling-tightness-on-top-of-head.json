            "answer": "Hi there.From what you have described, there can be several causes.\u00a0\u00a0One cause that I can think of is migraine with aura.\u00a0\u00a0'Auras' are sensations that accompany pain attacks and this can include the ear ringing and blurring of vision.\u00a0\u00a0Another common and overlooked cause for these symptoms is stress and the treatment would just be to avoid as much of it and have adequate rest.\u00a0\u00a0This could also be early manifestations of other conditions such as blood pressure problems, or blood sugar control problems.\u00a0\u00a0As there can be a lot of possibilities, It is best that you consult your doctor regarding this problem.\u00a0\u00a0For now, have adequate rest, sleep, and recreation.Take care and God bless.",

            "answer": "Hey,I had the EXACT same thing on August 8 and it hasn't completely gone away.\u00a0\u00a0My doc has tested for diabetes, thyroid issues, brain tumor, MS, epilepsy, inner ear issues, lead poisoning, and heart issues.\u00a0\u00a0From what I've read, any of them could be the culprit along with stress.While I still suffer, here's a tip: try eating a VERY restrictive diet of organic meat, vegetables, and brown rice -\u00a0\u00a0that's it.\u00a0\u00a0I did that to eliminate all allergies from my life and I have felt much better.\u00a0\u00a0I still have the EXACT symptoms you described, but only in the evening now.",

    "question": "I started having the weirdest pain the other day...a tingling sensation on the right side of my head. Now the sensation is on the top and right side and is accompanied by a tightness on the top of my head. The pain is not unbearable but is constant and doesn't go away. It's been about 4 days and I thought it would go away on it's own. I should also say that I almost passed out on Monday. I had ringing in my ears and blurred vision. Since then, I feel like I am walking on a boat, if that makes any sense. Does anyone have any ideas what could be causing this? I am really starting to get worried now....especially because this is constant and hasn't gotten better. My dr doesn't seem to think anything is wrong. PLEASE HELP!",
