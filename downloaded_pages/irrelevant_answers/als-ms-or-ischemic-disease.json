            "answer": "Hi and welcome.\u00a0\u00a0What it means is you have lots to worry about without any real infromation yet - it is hard to read those words and not think the worst and do the internet research. The types of spots that show up on your MRI can be caused by a number of different processes, including cardiac issues and diseases such as MS.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sorry you are left out there with these questions - I hope you connect with a neurologist soon and get the rest of the story started.In the meantime, I hope you will stick around here, read more and learn all you can about MS.\u00a0\u00a0Even if you don't have it, you will be smarter for it.be well, Laura",

    "question": "I am 48 yr old female. For 5 months I have had a weakness feeling in my arms and leg on my left side.Shoulder blade pain that as resolved. But my arm gets tired holding steering wheel for lengths of time. The leg is functional. Somtimes it feels tired down by the ankle and shin but I walk all day in my job. I also have been running/walking. This is the report from the MRI. 1.x 1.2 cm area of faint T2 hyperintensity in the white matter of the right frontal lobe. The exact origin and significance of this area of minimal T2 hyperintensity are difficult ot determine. The leading diagnostic considerations would be white matter ischemia or demylinating disease. Suspicion of neoplasm is low. Could somone give their thoughts on what this may be... I am obviously concerned. In process of getting neuro consult.",
