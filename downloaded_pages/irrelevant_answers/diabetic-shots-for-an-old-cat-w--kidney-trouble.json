We're starting off with the vets directions, to give him just a tiny bit for the first week, then see them in another week and then see where to go from there.\u00a0\u00a0Let's hope he only needs a little bit of insulin to regulate him.Grandma seemed to think he looked better already, but I'm not so excited until I see more time pass.\u00a0\u00a0How he looked these last few weeks was really sad.",

One time he got into problems with dehydration and I worked night shifts coming home every 3 hrs (quickly) to give him more fluids............ah those were tough times. But I'd do it all over again.We learn and they adapt, I think they instinctively know we are doing this to save them....than therefore they abide, sometimes reluctantly!!...My Opus was such a grump, a darling grump....I still miss him after 5 yrs.So I do understand your commitment Maddie, and I hope your dear sweet Maggie stays healthy for a long long time.Yes please let us know how Waldo is doing MJ, I hope you are managing alright, don't get stressed out..it will get easier...\u2665Opus",

He was trying to hide under the bench one of the times we took him.Today I caught him on our kitchen table cleaning a bowl I forgot to put in the sink. We thought that may be a sign he is feeling better. He jumped down as soon I saw him and I removed the bowl. Later I picked him up and put him on the couch and pet him. He really enjoyed it and purred.",

The other is designed for human but can be used on cats.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure what option would be better.\u00a0\u00a0I'm also left with a decision, if this doesn't work how long I should give it before deciding to let him go.",
