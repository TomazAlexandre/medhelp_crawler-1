            "answer": "This is only MYopinion.\u00a0\u00a0You would need an MRI of the entire spine to see if there are any problems there.\u00a0\u00a0Not just the cervical spine.\u00a0\u00a0Your damage, if there is some, can be in the thoracic area of your spine or even lower.I love the way you describe the EMG.\u00a0\u00a0That's exactly what it should be called.\u00a0\u00a0The \"damage\" in your arms and hands may be coming from trapped nerves or compression in the shoulder, elbow or hand itself.\u00a0\u00a0Have those areas been tested?That would be my suggestion.\u00a0\u00a0Check for nerve damage from the shoulder down through an EMG or a complete MRI of the entire spine.Good luck with that weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0My weight loss resulted in me coming off all diabetes medications, including insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Its amazing that my sugar is now controlled by diet alone after so many years on insulin and diabetes pills.\u00a0\u00a0It can be done.Best Wishes,Heather",

            "answer": "thanks for the suggestions.\u00a0\u00a0I think the test included my elbow, because she put the zapper close to my armpit (yikes!) but not my shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0(sigh)\u00a0\u00a0I don't know...what to do except try to be more patient, I guess.As far as the weight, I will have a long way to go.\u00a0\u00a0I probably need to lose at least 50 pounds to get complete control of my blood sugar, but that's OK because this is a lifestyle change, not a diet.\u00a0\u00a0Right now my testing (2-3 hours after breakfast) is 110-130. Why is it higher in the AM when I first get up and haven't eaten since dinner the night before?MK",

            "answer": "My blood sugar readings seem to always run high in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0They have ever since I started testing my glucose level 14 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0An hour after eating a bowl of cereal in the morning, it is around 120.Your test results after breakfast, I believe, are not bad at all.\u00a0\u00a0What are your morning readings BEFORE breakfast?\u00a0\u00a0When I checked into the hospital the other morning for hand surgery, after fasting since mid-night, I about fell off my chair, when the nurse said it was 203.\u00a0\u00a0Of course the night before surgery, I had my first pizza in over a year, with Sherbert for dessert.\u00a0\u00a0The pizza was loaded with 4 different cheeses, so I know where that reading came from.\u00a0\u00a0 Too many carbs....Heather",

The hardest thing is getting up and moving!\u00a0\u00a0My fatigue is some better since I stopped the statin drug, so I am trying to at least go outside and weed the garden, etc. True exercise is my biggest mountain to climb.\u00a0\u00a0Wierd, since I loved to lift weights in my late thirties. Ohhhhh, jeez,,,that was a long time ago....Thanks for the heads up about eating pizza!\u00a0\u00a0LOL..I love the stuff.\u00a0\u00a0Trying to figure out how to make one with Core foods...Hugs,Mary Kay",

            "answer": "Your fasting blood sugars should be around 80-90 ideally.\u00a0\u00a0If you morning readings are 140 to 160 you already ARE considered a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Have you ever had what they call an A1C test?\u00a0\u00a0This tests your blood sugar levels over the last 90 days.\u00a0\u00a0They can tell this just from the blood.\u00a0\u00a0If you have not had one of these I highly suggest it.I am so glad that you are feeling a little better since you stopped the statins.\u00a0\u00a0That is such good news.\u00a0\u00a0If you are like me, just grabbing any time of feeling somewhat better, I am all for it.\u00a0\u00a0I grab what I can, when I can.As far as the exercise, do a little here, a little there and step it up gradually, without over doing and especially be careful of those hot and humid days.\u00a0\u00a0When you do ANY exercise outside, carry water with you.\u00a0\u00a0I also keep a wet cloth in a zip lock bag that has one of those \"cold packs\" in it.\u00a0\u00a0I use the \"Cold Packs\" that come with my Copaxone delivery.\u00a0\u00a0I have passed those handy little ice packets out to many of my friends that find their flat size, very ideal for their summer coolers and camping equipment.\u00a0\u00a0They are invaluable.Please praivate message me and tell me all about this \"core\" plan that you are on.\u00a0\u00a0I want to hear more.Big Hugs and keep up the great work.Heather",

            "answer": "One of the reasons for a high am fasting glucose is morning rebound.\u00a0\u00a0It tends to occur in the earlier diabetics and in prediabetics.\u00a0\u00a0If the insulin resistance is not complete, a person may dip low at night and not notice because they are asleep.\u00a0\u00a0The low blood sugar causes an outpouring of hormones (like adrenaline) to pump the glucose back up and that is seen as an elevated BS in the morning when they awaken.\u00a0\u00a0You might want to discuss this with your nutritionist.\u00a0\u00a0You may need a small meal of protein late at night to prevent the pinp-pong effect of going too low and rebounding with a high sugar.Quix",

    "question": "My EMG (both \"zapper\" test and \"needlle\" test) revealed nerve damage in my legs and feet, but no nerve damage in my arms/hands..so the neuro wants to do a brain MRI.\u00a0\u00a0The cervical MRI report said my problems were not likely caused by bulging disks or stenosis.\u00a0\u00a0How can a brain MRI show a cause for my hand numbness if the nerve root is in the cervical area?BTW..glad to be off statin drug, but the only symptom that has improved (by about half) is the fatigue so far. Checking my blood sugar, and it is close to normal because I am being very careful about what I eat, and am trying to take off some weight.Blessings,Mary Kay",
