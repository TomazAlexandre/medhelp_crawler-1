            "answer": "You say your blood sugar level is 127. When? Fasting? After meals? Do you test when you feel dizzy? What do you get then? Do you test two hours after your meals? Dizziness and feeling strange can be symptoms of both being high and being low. I would test at various points, fasting, post prandial and bedtime and when you feel symptoms. If your blood sugar levels at all the tests are in normal range (70-140) and the symptoms continue, I would see your doctor because it could be totally unrelated to blood sugar and diabetes.",
