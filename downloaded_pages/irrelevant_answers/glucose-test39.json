            "answer": "I don't know exactly how much it is. Maybe around 8 oz. You have 5 minutes to drink all of it. The first time I did it I had a lemon lime that reminded me of Sprite for the first few sips. Then it was just terrible. The 2nd time I had a fruit punch. It wasn't quite as bad as the 1st. Both times I felt nauseous afterwards. Apparently, that's normal. You just can't throw up or else you will have to start over. You do NOT want to do that.",
