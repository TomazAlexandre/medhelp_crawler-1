            "answer": "Glad you posted Derin, as it seems you're trying to regain your health. It's never too late too start. You're asking the right questions now its up to you to follow through.\"Is this normal having the number higher when I get up then before going to bed??\"In the normal diabetes type 1 or type 2 classifications, no, but in reality you may be a candidate for LADA and/or diabetes type 1.5 See this for an explanation http://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/18382053.php.\"Is this urinating often caused by my sugar levels?\"Yes, high glucose can be one cause. Another is urinary tract infection. See these search results on frequent urination maleshttp://tinyurl.com/mhfnbf\"I have no other symptoms that are associated with diabetes\"Lose weight if your 230lbs has excess fat. Being overweight contributes a lot to unstable glucose levels, among other things. Are you sure? Check here for diabetes symptomshttp://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-symptoms.jsp\"I am on a diet since (no white bread, junk food, colored soda, etc)\"Attaboy. Junk food is poison, they may taste good but so do some poisons. Go to this link and click on the meal category and compare your foods. Its much healthier to eat foods in the Low GI side of the page. http://www.lowglycemicdiet.com/compareyourdiet.html\"... and walk everyday for 30 minutes.\"Good for you. Don't stroll nor saunter like you're grocery shopping. Walk like you're late for an appointment, or you're at the airport late for your flight. You'll get more benefits doing it this way, and you'll feel the immediate positives too.",

            "answer": "Many diabetics, including Type 2's have something called Dawn Phenomena when they are higher on rising. Some people actually treat this by having a small snack before bed. It has something to do with your body pumping glucose during the night, but I'm not the scientific one for an exact explanation. Be sure and tell your doctor about this when you go back because he will prescribe accordingly.",

    "question": "Hi,I am a 32 year old male 5'11 230 lbs.About 4 weeks ago I stated to have to go urinate quite frequently, some days every 2 hours some days less some days more, at night I get up once or twice to go urinate. (in the past I would sleep thru the night.)After a week of this I went to my Doctor, he took a urine sample and some blood work, urine came back fine, 4 days later he called me and said the blood work came back and said my hemoglobin is 6.8 (15 months ago it was 6.2) and he thinks I am a diabetic and that would explain why I need to urinate so often, he said further tests are needed to confirm diabetes, in the meantime he gave me a sugar testing kit and told me to keep a log and after reviewing it he will prescribe some meds. (also told me that I should try to loose some weight and exercises more)I am on a diet since (no white bread, junk food, colored soda, etc) and walk everyday for 30 minutes.While I'm logging my sugar levels I see that in the morning it is anywhere from 109 to 145 and during the day it is usely lower except 2-3 times were it was as high as 180\u00a0\u00a02 hours after meals but generally it is same before or after meals sometimes even lower then prior to the meal and usely before I go to bed it is around 110\u00a0\u00a0and then in the morning it is higher.Is this normal having the number higher when I get up then before going to bed ??Is this urinating often caused by my sugar levels? I have no other symptoms that are associated with diabetesThanksDerin",
