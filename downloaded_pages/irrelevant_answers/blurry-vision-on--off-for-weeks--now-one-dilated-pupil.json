            "answer": "You don't say whether this is a recent occurrence of it this disparity in pupil size has always been there.\u00a0\u00a0If the pupil size in your one eye has changed and is markedly different, you probably ought to see an opthalmologist (www.aao.org to find one in your area).\u00a0\u00a0I also suggest you start a separate thread in the Expert forum -- you will get a much quicker answer that way from one of the opthalmologists who regularly post here.Good luck.",

    "question": "First of all, I have gone to two opthamologists. My vision has been blurry on and off for almost a month now, but mainly from one eye. I went to the opthamologist a week ago and she said she couldn't find anything wrong and that my vision was slightly worse in that eye than the other, but no big problems. Then a couple days ago I noticed my left eye was about 4x the size as my right eye, almost took up my whole iris. It went down slightly over the night and I headed to another opthamologist the next day.He couldn't find any issues with my eyes, so said it could be Adie's Syndrome, a chemical that I got in my eye, or Diabetes. I don't think I have an other symptoms for Adie's except excessive sweating, I am not sure a chemical in my eye would have caused the blurryness over the last month and Diabetes (I am going to try to get tested this week), I eat very well, exercise 5-6x per week...overall great health.Any other ideas what this could be? I woke up this morning and the left high is still slightly larger than the other, but I am not seeing nearly as bad blurriness through the eye as before.",
