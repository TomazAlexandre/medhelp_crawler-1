            "answer": "Hi!First of all, can I tell you to TAKE A BREATH!Gosh, from reading your post, I got a little stressed out and I can only imagine how this is affecting you!I feel as though I can maybe offer you some direction as far as the diabetes numbers are concerned. I would say that a BS reading of 122 is just a bit elevated.\u00a0\u00a0Not like the 380 I was when I went to the doctor and was IMMEDIATELY put on medication.I will be the first to tell you that each person with diabetes is affected by different things.I myself can not eat carbs without my sugar going thru the roof.\u00a0\u00a0I can however have a candy bar and it will not effect me the same way.\u00a0\u00a0Go figure, I am Italian and would MUCH rather have the pasta than the candy...life is cruel!\u00a0\u00a0LoL!!Also, please know that STRESS & WEIGHT GAIN & of course not eating properly nor sleeping well can ALL have an affect on your sugar levels.I am going thru a very stressful time right now with my health and I am not sleeping well, not exercising, not eating correctly and I am emotionally drained.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is all having a negative effect on my BS numbers which have been excellent for months previous to this new situation.On a side note, your cholesterol number does not seem high to me, but I am not very familiar with that aspect of your issues.If your doc prescribed Metformin (Glucophage) for diabetes, it is a good medicine.\u00a0\u00a0It can help to get your appectite under control (in some people) in addition to getting your BS numbers under control.I am not a fan of popping pills, but after doing my research, I found that this is a common medicine.Sometimes you can get this under control with diet and exercise but it takes a firm commitment and perhaps with your other stressful situations going on right now, the pill you were prescribed would not be a bad idea, if even for a while.Don't feel alone...there are lots of us right there with you, especially when first hearing the words, \"You are diabetic.\"Keep in touch and hope I was of some comfort & help....Love & blessings... ~V",

            "answer": "Stress will not raise or lower your blood glucose reading when fasting. If that was your blood glucose when fasting it is slightly elevated.I have severe ptsd and still deal with extreme abuse. It does not change my blood glucose.What stress can affect is insulin resistance, high levels of cortisol from constant stress won't cause it but it can make it worse. If you were insulin resistant for some time it may be what lead to diabetes.Diet and exercise are great life style changes but if you are dealing with high levels of stress and anxiety. Seeing a therapist can go a long ways in helping you help yourself.Try meditation, yoga etc.When you feel anxiety rising over worries try grounding yourself by finding 5 things you see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can smell, 2 things you can taste and 1 happy thought even if a moment you enjoyed something. And then just breathe.Stress leads to anxiety, it isn't the stress you feel because stress is the thing or situation affecting you, we react using different mechanisms and one of yours could be anxiety. But only a licensed therapist or psychologist would be best to talk to about that. A doctor can acknowledge you are stressed but only therapists have the expertise to tell you more about it.Also a gynecologist isn't not a hormone specialist. They specialize in a generalized department of the reproduction organs almost like a primary care doctor does.Please see an endocrinologist not just a gyno.I went to a gyno for 2 years telling me I was fine and once I saw the endo he knew what tests to run and he did find what was wrong. And sometimes it also takes finding the right doctor if you feel like the doctor isn't listening to you.",
