            "answer": "Hi,all tissues in the body need a constant supply of water and nutrients that is exchanged by tiny holes in small blood vessels called capillaries which is reabsorbed and sent venously back to the heart also the lymphatic system helps pickup smaller waste that gets left behind,water buildup in the lungs is called pulmonary edema and can be caused by heart disease due to insufficient venous return from the lungs back to the heart,also infection or inflammation in the lungs affecting the exchange of fluid from blood vessels and the tissue can cause fluid buildup. Also kidney disease,can cause edema because the kidneys are what filter the water out of the blood so if they are not functioning properly excess fluid will be retained.I hope her physician is taking this pretty serious being that fluid buildup in the lungs can affect oxygen saturation potentially leading to death. Does she have a fever or swelling in her lower legs?",

            "answer": "Thanks for your response. She hasn't got any fever or swelling in her lower legs. Only a slightly runny nose which she got around the time she started feeling unwell. She has to relieve herself 2 -3 times every night although this has been a problem for years. She seems to be feeling much better now although one never knows what is going on internally while everything seems relatively normal from the outside.\u00a0\u00a0The cough that she was having has gone away so hopefully this means she is recovering.",

            "answer": "Hi,I'm glad to hear your mother is feeling better,as long as she keeps up with managing her diabetes and blood pressure,and go in for checkups she should do fine. I also just read that hyperglycemia from missing or delaying an insulin shot can cause reversible acute edema in the lungs,also high blood sugar causes increased thirst and urination,so you could ask her if she is monitoring her blood sugar as closely as she should. She has what would be considered coronary artery disease,but the heart echo (I assume they did an ECG also) should have ruled that out as the cause of the edema,if the edema was mild it could have been caused by infection possibly complicated by increased immobility. Or a combination of infection,immobility,and hyperglycemia. Take care.",

            "answer": "Systemic acidosis shutting down kidney filtration. The lungs get effected quite a bit because they're eliminative organs. Edema is a buffer to acids interstitially. It's from a lifetime of eating grains, animal products, cooked & artificial foods, and a negative death consciousness society.

    "question": "I am interested to know how water gets into the lungs. My mother has been coughing for about a week when she hadn't been for a very long time. She has also been having a runny nose for a couple of weeks. She had a bypass operation 5 yrs ago, suffers from high blood pressure and diabetes and has been on medication for many years. After a heart scan at the hospital today, she was told she has a slightly clogged artery but strangely also water in her lungs. I wonder what this could be due to. Has anyone had this before? thanks.",
