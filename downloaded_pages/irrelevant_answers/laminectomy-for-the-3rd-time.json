            "answer": "Dear Pam:As you are well aware, spinal surgery is an \"if'y\" thing and usually the only patient population that really has a good outcome are those with mechanical type pain.\u00a0\u00a0That is pain with movement.\u00a0\u00a0Surgery for other reasons is not as well documented with good outcomes.\u00a0\u00a0In some respects the second opinion is correct and rehab is truely the initial choice for benefit.\u00a0\u00a0I would push the rehab (in a center with good PT's and rehab physicians) as best you can.\u00a0\u00a0Frankly, I imagine that you will feel somesort of pain, but hopefully in reduced intensity.\u00a0\u00a0Hang-in there and do your best at rehab.\u00a0\u00a0It will pay off in the long run.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

            "answer": "I have written severaltimes about my L4l5 lamenctomy. Thisis the one whee the surgeon compromised both sciatic nerves that emanate from that location.\u00a0\u00a0I had to lern to wlk again withwalkers, crutches and finaly wiht leg/foot brace tht keeps my foot from dropping. The intense \"stocking pain\" went away after about six months. One neurologist source said the intense painwas the nerve covering dy8ng or disentigrating and later the nerve atrphy itself.I am ambulatory fairly well after 11 years but II would like to be able to play golf again or ust climb ladders to put up theChristmas lights.\u00a0\u00a0Is there any Rx that will help me - therapy, exercise, diet - anything???",

    "question": "HELP!\u00a0\u00a0NEED ADVICE FAST!I had microdisketomy surgery at L4/L5 in April 1998 at Hughston Sports Medicine Hospital (orthopedic surgeon).\u00a0\u00a0Pain really never went away and continuously got worse.Had Lumbar Laminectomy with Microscopic Diskectomy at L4/L5 in March 1999 (neurosurgeon).\u00a0\u00a0Pain and numbness in right leg still present.\u00a0\u00a0Had an MRI in October which indicated another piece of disk ruptured.Went to Emory University Hospital to see another neurosurgeon in October for 2nd opinion and had a myelogram.\u00a0\u00a0His diagnosis confirmed what my doctor saw.\u00a0\u00a0He did state that studies have shown that people who exercise and people who opt to have surgery are at the same place in four years.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor here in Columbus, GA gave me some back exercises to do for one month to see if they will help, but I continue to be in pain, which is bearable and not constant, but the pain is still there and my leg continuosly stays weak.My question - will exercise help or will this progressively get worse and I have to have surgery for the third time?\u00a0\u00a0What's to say that the third time is a charm?\u00a0\u00a0I need to know what to do before the end of the year as I've already met my deductibles for this year and my insurance would pay 100%!\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!",
