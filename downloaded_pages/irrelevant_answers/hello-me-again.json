    "question": "Hello, it is me again well to be exact the name of the prescription is Albuterol sulfate 2mg tablets. And the reason I was asking about it is because on the information page that they give with the prescription it says that it is for asthma and any other symtoms your doctor seems necessary for. And on the warnings it says if pregnant ask your doctor of the benefits of using this drug while pregnant. But I guess my doctor knows what she is doing right?????????????I also wanted to thank everybody for the support on letting me know something about the chances of my baby if he decides to come early I am really trying to relax and keep him in there just a bit longer I want him to stay at least till 37 weeks I am officially 33 weeks and 2 days today. So 3 weeks and 5 days more to go. And yes he is getting big with the diabetes I can feel him already right under my rib cage when he moves poor thing doesn't have much room to move. Well thank you again.",
