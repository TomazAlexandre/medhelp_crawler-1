            "answer": "Usually green in diaper is from a lactose intolerance .. usually self corrects but not always if it is a milk \"problem\" or allergy/intolrance.CORN .. Barbara .. corn may be a culprit if the milk/soy is still a problem.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to send you a message to see how things are going but wanted to post this, too as corn is in many formulas.You may want to try Alimentum RTF (the powder I believe has corn in it) and see if this helps at all.Mommy .. how did you make out?Cheryl",

    "question": "My grandson is 4 months old and, for the past 6 weeks, has had blood in his stool and it has gotten very mucusy in the past month. The blood is a dark red or black - not very much and not in every bowel movement. Just a couple of specks, now and then. The bowel movements have been very mucusy though. He is strictly breastfed (no cereal yet), is gaining weight (birth weight: 8.7 oz, present weight: 13.2 lb), is happy and doesn't show signs of discomfort. My daughter has brought him to a doctor, and then to a gastreologist (sp?) and has omitted milk and now soy products from her diet. The problem has not gotten better. Movements are green and quite smelly; only one a day or less, though. I noticed this week that he also seems to have gas - thought it was a dirty diaper at first, but proved not to be. He does not seem uncomfortable. I am getting concerned that this doesn't seem to be resolving itself. I have read that perhaps starting him on cereal might help. Just as an FYI, my daughter had gestational diabetes while pregnant, but strictly followed the diet given to her by the doctor and blood sugars at birth were in the normal range. I would appreciate any feedback and suggestions as to what we can do.",
