            "answer": "Most stores will have a section of Organic foods and veggie, you just have to look harder. I know the one I go to has a special section for organic fruits and veggies, they cost a little more, but, are worth it.As to meat, that might be a little harder, however, again, in the larger stores, they can be found. Also, if you know of a good butcher/delicatessen, this can be a good source for the organic meat. I have started to cut back on meat, I notice that when I eat it, I get bad tummy aches, and now that I am eating less of it and eating more fish and such, I am doing better. There are so many chemicals in it anymore, it is sad.Oh yes, if you have access to a local health food store, they would no doubt be helpful in obtaining the kind of food you are wanting.",
