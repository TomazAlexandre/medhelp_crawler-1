We\u2019ll all benefit from a good diet, so something like the American Heart Association or a type 2 diabetes diet high in fiber, lean meat and fresh fruits and veggies is always a plus.Best of luck,--Bill",

            "answer": "Taken from Dr. Mark Hyman in \"Ultrametabolism\"...adequate protein is required to supply the amino acids used by the liver to provide the building blocks for the powerhouse of our detoxification system, glutathione.\u00a0\u00a0(BTW Tylenol destroys glutathione.)\u00a0\u00a0...following foods will help you prime your system for detoxification:-Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, kale, collards, Brussel sprouts, cauliflower, bok choy,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chinese cabbage, Chinese broccoli- Green tea- Watercress- Dandelion greens- Cilantro- Artichokes- Garlic- Citrus peels- Pomegranate- Cocoa(P.S. there's a lot of protein in veges and grains - you do not have to rely fully on animal products.\u00a0\u00a0Also, with hep C, we do have to monitor our protein levels so as not to have too much protein.)Although this is billed as a diet book it really addresses how food and supplements can be used to address the bodies ills.\u00a0\u00a0In chapter 15 \"Love Your Liver\"\u00a0\u00a0he starts with a story of a Hep C pt on tx and why it wasn't working and how certain changes in diet and lifestyle helped tx to be successful.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, HTH and it's not too much info.",

            "answer": "Sugar is a shock to the liver, stresses the digestive process, stresses the pancreas, and it feeds the virus.\u00a0\u00a0Also, excess iron can be very damaging to the liver and has been cited as a factor that reduces response rates to interferon therapy.There appears to be a connection between hepatitis C and problems with the regulation of sugar and subsequent development of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The liver is responsible for regulating blood sugar levels. It does this by converting the food we eat into substances that the body can use. Carbohydrates and sugars are stored as glycogen in the liver and are released as energy when the bodys energy demands are high. People with end stage liver disease often have difficulty in regulating blood sugar. One remedy is to consume small, frequent meals that will keep blood sugar levels more constant.http://www.hepctrust.org.uk/Wellness/caring-for-yourself/diet",

            "answer": "I added a line about protein thinking that if I didn't someone else would point it out the risk of too much protein for some folks.\u00a0\u00a0A more complete explanation would have been that those with encephalopathy or risk of same should monitor protein levels.\u00a0\u00a0From the web:While some experts do not believe there is a link between dietary protein and encephalopathy, others believe in substantially reducing or even eliminating animal protein and adhering to a vegetarian diet, in order to help improve mental status. Patients who are at risk for encephalopathy may be advised to eat no more than .6 - .8 gm. of animal source protein per kilogram of body weight per day. (Animal source proteins are meat, fish, eggs, poultry, and dairy products. Each provides 7 gm. of actual protein per ounce of food.) There is no limit on vegetable protein consumption. Maintaining adequate protein intake and body weight should be considered a priority if vegetarian protein substitutes are not utilized .PROTEIN AND HEPATITIS CAdequate protein intake is important to build and maintain muscle mass and to assist in healing and repair. Protein intake must be adjusted to one's body weight. Approximately 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight is recommended in the diet each day. Therefore, protein intake should be between about 60 - 120 grams a day in patients with hepatitis C, unless a complication of cirrhosis known as encephalopathy occurs. Encephalopathy is an altered mental status. The exact cause is not fully understood and is probably multifactorial. It has been shown that restriction of the diet of animal protein and maintaining a total vegetarian diet, helps reverse this condition and improve mental capacity.",
