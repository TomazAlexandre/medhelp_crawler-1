            "answer": "Hi there! -Just a question...Have you recently taken antibiotics for anything? This does sound like a yeast infection which can be caused by many things (antibiotics are the most common.) Changes in female hormones or poor \"ventilation\" (wearing tight clothing/ a warm, moist environment, sitting for long periods of time, diabetes, obesity) can set you up for one. If you choose not to call your Dr about this (most Drs will just tell you over the phone to use an antifungal treatment) try eating yogurt for the next 10 days and buy an over-the-counter medicine called Miconozole (5 day). It has vaginal suppositories that will get rid of it. Be sure to shower daily, dry yourself completely, -douching isn't necessary. Just because it isn't itching and burning doesn't mean it isn't yeast. I hope this helps!\u00a0\u00a0~MM",
