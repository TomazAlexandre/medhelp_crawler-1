            "answer": "I have done numerous Google searches on this, and it is almost unanimous, the Fasting range should be between 60 and 99, 100 to 126 is \"pre-diabetes\" and 126 and above is \"established diabetes\". Just watch your diet and eat fewer carbs, and of course, cut back on the sugar. Those drinks are awfully high in sugar, and yes, they can give \"spikes\" meaning fast rise in sugar.I might add, make sure your\u00a0\u00a0hands are washed thoroughly before taking the sample, even a little bit of sugary food or drink, can give higher readings.",

            "answer": "Your numbers look fine to me. Have you been trying to loose weight?Your best idea would be to see a GP for the OGTT (Oral glucose tolerance test) this will tell you pretty much what is going on, also, an A1C test, this will show what\u00a0\u00a0your blood sugars have been for the past three months. It is almost becoming the gold standard instead of the fasting test.",

    "question": "This morning i took my blood test (not a diabetic, trying to rule out low blood sugar that may cause some symptoms im having) and it ranged from 118 right when i woke up to 95 when i got moving.Is too much blood on the strip bad? should i just have enough on the strip to allow a reading and take my finger away? it seemed that my readings were lower when it got just enough blood to get a reading and i took my finger away. also, how fast does a sport drink like gatorade raise your blood sugar? i had a gulp of it this morning with my meds and my blood sugar reading was 104",
