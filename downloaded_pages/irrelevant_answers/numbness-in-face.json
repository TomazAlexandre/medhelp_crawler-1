            "answer": "HiBilateral (on both sides) facial numbness is mainly due to diabetic neuropathy, panic attacks or as a side effect of drugs. Alcoholic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis and neuropraxia or bruised nerves could also be the cause numbness on both sides of the face. Please go through this and see if something strikes you like diabetes or alcohol use. If not please consult a neurologist.Hope this helps. Take care!",

            "answer": "This is my first time posting anything and wasn't sure if anyone would respond, so thank you. I am not diabetic. I do not drink at all. No trauma that I recall. I do however smoke and was told I had early small vessell disease of the brain (MRI). I had the MRI after the vertigo incidence. I do have Restless Leg Syndrome that started while being pregnant 7 years ago. I do take 1mg xanax at night for sleep because of this. Also, if I prop my head up on my hands like to watch TV, I feel like the circulation is being cut off to my head and get an instant pouding headache. I researched that a bit and found something about basilar artery involvement. Anyway, I will be seeing a neurologist soon and hopefully he can come up with something. I keep putting it off thinking that it may just be stress.Thank You.",

    "question": "I suffered my first round of vertigo a couple of months ago. It lasted for a couple of weeks, getting better each day. Toward the end I started feeling a cold, creeping numbness in my nose that spread up to my forehead and then around my eyes and up to about the middle of the top of my head. My doc thinks it may be stress related but is referring me to a neuro. The feeling stays the same, never better or worse. Just constant. I've been researching this but cannot find anything about numbness on both sides of the face. It feels kind of like my face has had a shot of novacaine.",
