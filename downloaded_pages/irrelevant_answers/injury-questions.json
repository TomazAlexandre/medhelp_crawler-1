            "answer": "Wounds that don't heal can be caused by a variety of reasons including immune disorders.\u00a0\u00a0Generally when healing is delayed or absent, diabetes is suspected rather than cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Bones that have been bruised or broken can take up to a year or longer to get back to normal. Are you are speaking of a bruise that is on the skin that isn't going away and isn't changing?\u00a0\u00a0A bruise is mostly blood that has accumulated under the skin because of burst blood vessels and will go away over time.\u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes the blood is a \"hemotoma\" or blood clot that doesn't\u00a0\u00a0go away and over time becomes permanent.\u00a0\u00a0Bruising isn't usually a \"sign\" of cancer. If you are fearful of cancer due to bruising (cancers of the blood), you can do a simple CBC blood test to include differentials.\u00a0\u00a0The results of this test would indicate blood disorders of any type, not just cancer. If there are abnormailites, other tests can be ordered to \"narrow it down\".\u00a0\u00a0If you are fearful of cancers of the bone (lack of healing) a plain xray of the body part will indicate changes in the bone.\u00a0\u00a0If any changes are found, MRI or CT would be ordered to identify the problem.\u00a0\u00a0If you are really fearful of all cancers, and you can afford it, you can request a prescription from your doctor for a CT whole body scan, which will check out abnormalities throughout the entire body and all organ systems.\u00a0\u00a0Insurance doesn't usually cover whole body scans, so you would have to cover the costs out-of-pocket. hope this helps",

            "answer": "Easiest way of knowing is naturally a clinical look-see by a Dr.Sounds like you have a deeper question than what you typed.If you had a broken bone & know for sure it's the same placewhere it's now bruised or bleeding, you need to have a Dr./nurseor clinic take a look. If it's been bleeding off/on say over 10days it's time to see a Dr. If you are referring to somethingon the skin surface that's been there awhile & bleeds slightly,heals, maybe crusts lightly & then bleeds lightly again, youneed to go to a dermatologist. It could be minor/basal cell/squamous cell skin cancer. That would require a small biopsy todetermine. Many benign spots can also bleed so best to check.Maybe if you described what you're worried about alittle more,we can help. Take care.",
