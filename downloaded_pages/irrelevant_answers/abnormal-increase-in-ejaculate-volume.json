    "question": "I am a 60 year old man. No diabetes, high BP or general health problems. I do have\u00a0\u00a0low testosterone, having twice tested. Once gave the\u00a0\u00a0LOW level of\u00a0\u00a0the female range. A second test a year later after exercise and diet gave a reading at the lowest end of the male range. I am considering HRT. I have tried Testosterone Undeconate (?) capsules (Andriol). They certainly increased my libido and general \"male drive\", not just sexually. I have not used them for months however.I am sexually active. Over the years my ejaculate remained normal, thick, white but much decreased in volume as I aged. Starting about two months ago, my ejaculate volume has shot up. I am ejaculating about 3 to 5 x more. However, it is\u00a0\u00a0watery and thin and pale. I used to be able to projectile ejaculate about 5 feet. This disappeared with age. Now I am shooting ejaculate again, but that is because it's watery. My first ejaculation after a week of inactivity is\u00a0\u00a0slightly thick, but pale. A second orgasm in 24 hrs produces very very thin ejaculate, but many times the previous volume.",
