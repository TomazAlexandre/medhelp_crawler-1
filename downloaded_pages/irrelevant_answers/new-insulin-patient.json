Its simple to fix but its all up to you if want to be healthy.\"my blood sugar are still not under control, they are still going up and down just like a mountain peak,\"Controlling high blood sugar (glucose) is a simple and easy thing to do. You are depending on medication to control your glucose level instead of you taking control of your health. STOP consuming sweet drinks, sugary foods and foods laden with bad carbs, period. Read the ingredient label on food packaging!\u00a0\u00a0Proper nutrition - more fruits and vegetables - and moderate exercise (like walking) will help lower and control your glucose level. If you are OVERWEIGHT, lose it. All the help and useful information on diabetes is here http://www.diabetes.org/home.jsp\"I have considered going in to see my internist and talking to him in person about how I am feeling both physically and emotionally, do you think tis mght be a good idea,\"Yes indeed if you want hear what I said above from a doctor. Your PCP can't help you emotionally but a therapist or psychologist may in regards to your depression.",

            "answer": "Hi,having to deal with physical illness is a challenge.\u00a0\u00a0And having just had to start insulin is also obviously something you still have to come to terms with.Like Dot said, the key is not just the meds (though they are very important) but it is diet and exercise and maintaining ideal weight that will help you get your blood sugars under control.Talk to your internist by all means.\u00a0\u00a0Hope he can help.\u00a0\u00a0But also educate yourself as much as possible about diabhetes and what you need to keep this under control. That way you'll be able to manage things well and feel better about the whole thing.Best wishes",
