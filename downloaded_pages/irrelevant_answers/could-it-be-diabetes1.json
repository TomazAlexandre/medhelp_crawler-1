            "answer": "Have you been tested for hypoglycemia? Breaking out in a sweat is a common symptom of low blood sugar, and it is possible to pass out if the sugar levels get too low. Most healthy people find that their bodies fix the situation pretty quickly once the brain sends out signals for emergency sugars to be released from the liver, which would mean that the symptoms are temporary. So hypoglycemia spells could be the cause of passing out... and of course the number might be very normal when you are discovered and blood is drawn because the body has already released emergency sugars. Tingling sensations, fatigue, hot flashes OR feeling unexplainably chilled, headaches, nausea, inability to concentrate are all symptoms of hypoglycemia. And some people (me included) can have a racing heart and discomfort in the chest caused by muscle spasms when hypoglycemic. Maybe a glucose tolerance test would show how your pancreas responds to stimulus. You might want to start taking some written notes when this happens... what did you eat that day? Are there any things that happened that elevated stress levels? Looks for possible triggers so that you may be able to treat them and maybe stop the cycle.One friend of mine found that he becomes hypoglycemic if he takes vitamins containing chromium. Once he stopped the intake of chromium, his symptoms of hypoglycemia stopped. So that is another thing to look at.The other thing I would suggest if you haven't already had these checked out would be all other endocrine glands. Are you producing enough thyroid and cortisol hormones??? You may have to ask your doctor to check these things. Odd how we used to go to doctors and assume that they would immediately know what our problems' causes were, but medical knowledge has come so far that no doctor can know it all now. Sometimes the patient stumbles across the answer first by doing research on his or her own, and then asks the doctor to check it out.",
