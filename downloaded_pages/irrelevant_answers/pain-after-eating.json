            "answer": "When someone comes back from Africa, and get sick, the first thought is infection. Weight loss may be due to lost appetite, pain which prevents her to eat, or malabsorption, which may be due to intestinal infection. Stool tests for bacteria and parasiters, and blood tests for typical viral diseases from Africa should be done. Now I don't know what tests she already had.",

            "answer": "Thank you, boron.After uppper G.I. yesterday with icetobe (sp?) with food and following food under survey, determination is \"gastroporesius\" (sp?) - massive regurgitation- the stomach is not processing food normally, thus the pain before emptying into the duodenum and causing great pain because food is backed up into the esophogus and more pain results plus acid reflux.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor said it is idiopathic which in my book means \"don't know what's causing this.\" Virus that is not dedected by any tests?\u00a0\u00a0Granddaughter has been put on low fat diet - no more milkshakes, fatty foods and has a medication to help process meals/food.\u00a0\u00a0She started eating foods because she was very hungry and sick of light soups, \"milkshakes,\" applesauce, ensure, etc. but that is when the pain was increased after solid food was ingested.\u00a0\u00a0There is not any bright red or black stool.\u00a0\u00a0Granddaughter visits same doctor next week for follow-up. The doctor believes she picked up a virus in Africa and sometimes, tests cannot detect certain viruses.\u00a0\u00a0Many other exams and tests have been conducted out of hospital - all negative.\u00a0\u00a0Since she was given an antibiotic at first and that did not solve the issue, the condition is possibly virus related.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for following this condition through with me.\u00a0\u00a0It was scarey because I couldn't understand why she was released from the hospital on the first visit without total body exam and finding some results before releasing her.\u00a0\u00a0She had lost 15 pounds (she was 130 pounds), became dehydrated and that seemed pretty serious to me.\u00a0\u00a0We shall see if this last diagnosis is correct and meds will solve the condition and get her back to a \"normal digestive system.\"",

            "answer": "It sounds like gastroparesis, causaed by some event. Trigger was maybe that food poisoning.I can't imagine how could some new disease cause gastroparesis all of the sudden. Hypothyroidism is one possible cause or predisposition.Gallbladder - if only ultrasound was done, gb disease is not excluded. HIDA scan can be done. Gallbladder pain is on the right side under the ribs. Abdominal migrain is another possibility.",
