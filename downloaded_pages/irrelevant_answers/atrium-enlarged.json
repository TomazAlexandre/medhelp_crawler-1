            "answer": "The echo reveals some enlargement of the right side of your heart with mildly incrased pressure. These findings alone would not be sufficient to explain your severe symptoms. An undetected abnormality on the echocardiogram, such as valve disease that was not properly visualized, could account for the abnormalities on the echo and your symptoms. A stress echocardiogram will also be useful.",

Mild diastolic noncompliance left ventricular structure.mild enlargement of the left atrium. tricuspid flow demonstrates a significant jet of regurgitation graded as +2/4.Peak flow velocity of this jet correlates with mild elevation of right ventricular systolic pressure. Mitral flow end flow velocities are mildly abnormal demonstrated reversal of the E and A ratio consistant with mild diastolic noncompliance.Right ventricle is enlarged at 24.0-mm and left atrium is enlarged at 43.0-mmNow my symptoms are getting worse and worse, shortness of breath pulling on the side of chest , dizzy, very very tired, little exertion makes me very winded and I sweat alot, getting sick to my stomache and feet and fingers are swelling alot too.going for stress test today.
