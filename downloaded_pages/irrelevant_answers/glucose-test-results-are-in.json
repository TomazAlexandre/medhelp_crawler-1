            "answer": "Looking big does not mean that you have gest. diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, many people don't have a clue as to how big pregnant women actually get before becoming ready to deliver.\u00a0\u00a0I had someone ask me if I was just about ready at 5 months...I thought \"I hope not!\", but they just don't know how huge we will get.\u00a0\u00a0So, I wouldn't judge your size on what anyone says.\u00a0\u00a0Eat well and drink lots of water and your baby will grow to his or her appropriate size!\u00a0\u00a0Besides, they say that larger babies (over 8 lbs) have way less complications at birth and in their yourng life.\u00a0\u00a0From my studies I have learned that the common test used to detect gest. diabetes can be inacurate because it uses a type of sugar that is not normally in our diets.\u00a0\u00a0So there is probably nothing to worry about.\u00a0\u00a0If you are nervous or think you might have something to worry about, limmit your refined sugar and refined carbohydrate intake.\u00a0\u00a0This can help dramatically if you are borderline at this point.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0And I hope your baby is just the right size!",

            "answer": "Oh, as far as other symptoms, there are none that I know of except measuring large.\u00a0\u00a0And by that I mean more than 2 weeks bigger, and even this does not indicate anything for sure.\u00a0\u00a0That is why they do the glucose test.",

            "answer": "I thought the normal was 120? Hmmm. I may have to look that up. Mine was 106 which I thought was high but they told me it was pretty good.I'm looking big myself too. Everyone that sees me thinks I'm ready to POP! It could be because I was really skinny from my waistline before and now all I have is this BIG belly POCKING OUT. LOLIf they told you passed, then don't worry about it. I would just watch what you eat and your sugar intake just so you don't cross over to the 140 line.Good luck! DRINK PLENTY OF WATER and stay away from too many sweets.XOXO,Ari",

Dont stress - it increases sugar level in body (this was my problem, thanks to DH)2. Stop white rice completely.3. No fruit juices (as juices are high in sugar)4. Eat neutral & high fibre fruits they help (kiwi, dragon fruit)5. I have sweet urge, so she suggested me to have 1/2 banana or 1 spoon icecream or 10 grapes, 5 lychee, 1/2 slice mango to satisfy the craving.6.Quit bread [especially white bread]7. No plain flour or maggi or noodles.8. have cereals with No sugar added.9. Always check ingredients wen u buy..less/no sodium {for all preg ladies}, less sugar, high in fibre, less carbohydrates.10. if possible have early dinner..else try to have less carbohydrates for dinner. ( i stopped completey for a week and lost 1 kg, which is not good as baby needs it)11. Eat lots of veges..(sorry im a pure veg, so have no idea how to subsititute for non veg stuff)12. Do have some sweet if u have the craving else u will feel giddy ( i did feel giddy & my Dr was v angry with me since i stopped sweets completely)13. Do Yoga (v v helpful)isn't the post quite big?lemme know incase u need some more info.try n control these things as baby is v precious..so v gotta b responsible mothers. I still follow most of the above just to be on the safe end.",

    "question": "I called the Dr office today to see if my results have come back which i assumed they shouldve been back and they were normal is why they didnt call me.\u00a0\u00a0Well my results were 138, im a little sad because 140 means you failed the test, 138 is still close to 140, she said technically you passed the test and not to worry.Only reason im concerned is bcuz people ask me are you do this month, my belly is very big and i look like i could be due any day now, and i was wondering mayb i had gestational diabetes and that the baby is big and thats why my belly is so big.Any suggestions?\u00a0\u00a0 What symptoms will you have during the pregnancy if you have gestational diabetes?Im just shocked, 138?",
