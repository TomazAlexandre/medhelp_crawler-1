            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Chances of MS are less. Yes, Lymes could be a possibility and should be tested. It\u2019s unlikely that its compression of spinal nerves, however if all other conditions are ruled out, this should be looked at.Hyperthyroidism should be suspected in case of burning in eyes and hot and sweaty upper body (like the burning in upper body you have). In females (you do say you are a male, but on net one can never be sure) above 40 years it can be a symptom of menopause or premenopause. Peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes too should be looked into. Fibromyalgia is another possibility.Do discuss this with your PCP and get your self examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Hi, im in a sinlular postition to you, but i am an 19 yr old female. i also get tingling feelings in my rectum, i find its usually before i go to the toilet but thats not always the case. i thought it might have been MS but i am convinced i suffer from health anxiety so i know i am probably blowing thing out of proportion. i noticed you said it started from a virus, i havnt felt the same since 2 yrs ago wen i had what i thought must have been food poisoning but the hospital couldnt identify it. i was being sick, couldnt get out of bed because of the pain in my back and rib cage, couldnt eat etc. since i seem to constantly have an ache somewhere in my body, obsessing over it is what has caused my health anxiety, or at least what i have diagnosed myself to have.i am goin to the docs tomorrow so i will post anything i find out! feel better soon :)",

            "answer": "Hang in there! It can just be something simple and you won' know until they run a battery of tests. Remember. medicine is a practice.. Doc's may not have all the answers. See a good neurologist. They can help you. In the meantime, eat a healthy diet and get as much exercise as you can. Watch the Comedy Channel on TV if you can to keep some laughter in your life.",

    "question": "Hi, My name's Jeff , I'm from Toronto Canada....I'm 28 years old, never had any significant health problems up until last December.In December 2009 I started to get a tingling burning sensation in my back around my left shoulder blade, after a week or so I started to notice my right shoulder blade was also sore...by the end of December the burning spread to my upper abdomen (the upper most part of my stomach) The burning would go back and forth between my back and stomach....My family doctor didn't know what was causing it....then about a month ago at the end of May...I caught a cold and sore throat from my girlfriend...well that virus set off something and my nerves went haywire...I started getting extreme weakness and tingling in both legs and to a lesser extent my arms...the weakness and tingling is bilateral and comes and goes in waves....I also get tingling between my scrotum and rectum from time to time......then my eyelids started burning pretty bad...that lasted a couple days leaving my eyes red and weak....I've also felt tingling in the back of my head along with pretty frequent dizzy spells...this has been going on for a month now...my initial problems with my burning shoulder blades and top of stomach are still present....I'm unable to work and waiting to see a specialist....I'm very scared....I have a 10 month old son and I'm praying I'm gonna be ok....\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound like MS??
