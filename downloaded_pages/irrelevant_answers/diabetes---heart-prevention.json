As with most medications, daily compliance with all of these is imperative for maintaining healthy cardiovascular fitness.",

            "answer": "Did your dad get a drug eluded stent? If so, he should be on the plavix for at least a year.\u00a0\u00a0I have a stent since 2006 and my Cadiologist said I have to take it indefinitely. I can only go off it for surgical procedures and then go back on it again. Maybe when the doctor answers your post he may mention this also. If he's on a bare metal stent then I think it should be 3 months. I'm not sure though. I think I may have read it on the heart forum.I'm only speaking thru my experience w/drug eluded stent. I'm certainly no expert.Best wishes for your dad.",
