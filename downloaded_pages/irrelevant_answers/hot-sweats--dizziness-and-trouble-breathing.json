It is a symptom of insufficient blood, oxygen, or, rarely, glucose supply to the brain.It can occur prior to a syncopal event of any etiology and with hyperventilation or hypoglycemia.I think you should be seeing a physician for evaluation and management.Are you diabetic? Do you have asthma or allergic disorder in any form?",

    "question": "Hi,I'm a 22yr old female, in perfect health, I joined the gym in mid december 2007 and i can't seem to do more than 10minutes on the eliptical without having a feeling of dizziness, shortness of breath and my body gets very hot. I remember when I used to work out, that I was able to do 15minutes without a problem. Is there a special breathing technique I need to learn? I don't have breathing problems otherwise and I'm just scared that this is a side effect of something more major, if anyone has an answer, please help! thank you.",
