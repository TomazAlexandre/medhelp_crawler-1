            "answer": "Hi Kevin:The first thing I would tell you is not to panic, and it's been my experience that you have come to the right place for answers.The AST/ALT levels are not an indicator as to how long or even how mild the virus is. A liver biopsy is a must, it will best tell you how severe the virus has affected your liver. You have very likely had this virus for years, my husband has been infected for probably 25+ years before being detected in April. Genotype and viral load are also important. Both will give you some indication of what is to come, but neither are the sole factors in determining your outcome. My husband had an ultra sound and CT scan and neither of them picked up any problems with his liver, yet the biopsy showed him at grade 1 inflammation and stage 3 liver disease, so treatment was a must for him. He also had a viral load of 9,230,000 and is genotype 1B, but after only 3 weeks of treatment his PCR came back <10. You have much to learn in the coming weeks and I have found this board to be the best. Everyone will be here for you.My thoughts are with you and yours,Debbe",

            "answer": "Kevin,When I was diagnosed seven weeks ago (I'm 44, by the way), I thought I had been handed a death sentence.\u00a0\u00a0It was such a blow to be told I have a serious condition -- especially since I've always been a bit of a health-nut.\u00a0\u00a0Like you, I didn't fit into any of the typical risk profiles of someone with HCV.Now, seven weeks later, and with the benefit of knowing more information: i.e. my genotype (1a), my viral load (very, very low); and liver biopsy results (moderate inflammation, no significant fibrosis), I feel like I have a future again.\u00a0\u00a0My initial sense of panic and terror have subsided.\u00a0\u00a0I had imagined the very worst (dead in a few months), but the reality didn't come anywhere close to that.I know it's hard not to be afraid when so much is still \"unknown,\" but please try to keep a level head during the next few weeks.\u00a0\u00a0The folks here are very kind and have a wealth of information to share.\u00a0\u00a0They've helped me put things into perspective on several occassions.Hang in there Kevin.\u00a0\u00a0My thoughts and prayers are with you.Susan",

            "answer": "I just wanted to say don't be unduly worried about the sharing of clippers and toothbrushes, although obviously you will want to stop those practices in the name of common sense.My husband probably had the virus for 20 years before we found out.\u00a0\u00a0We shared toothbrushes on lots of\u00a0\u00a0occasions, have had \"plenty\" of opporotunities to pass the virus on to each other (if you get my drift), and I often tended his cuts and boo-boo's without gloves before we knew.\u00a0\u00a0(shamefully, I still don't worry about his blood, but he is now a sustained responder and is undetectable and I just don't worry about it).\u00a0\u00a0If anyone should have gotten it from him, it would be me, and I am neg.He is a type 3, supposedly the easiest to treat, yet relapsed after his first treatment and had to do a second, year long treatment.\u00a0\u00a0I am glad we had the biopsy even though they aren't recommending them for 3's, b/c he does have cirrhosis.Good luck to you, stay calm, I don't think your family is in any danger.\u00a0\u00a0I hope your wife's test is negative.\u00a0\u00a0Read all you can, learn all you can, and be at peace with yourself on this new journey.",

I'm sure they can give you a lot of good advice and support.I know how devastating these recent turn of events must seem to your family right now.\u00a0\u00a0Somehow, I've come to find peace in the midst of my own HCV storm by reminding myself that this is a battle that CAN be won.\u00a0\u00a0Many people on this planet are facing much greater struggles than me with little or no hope of overcoming them. I've prayed for courage and strength to get through this and my prayers have been answered.\u00a0\u00a0I feel confident to face what the future holds and I have a sense of peace in my heart.\u00a0\u00a0You\u00a0\u00a0and your wife will find that, too, once you get pass the initial shock of the situation.We're here for you and your wife, Kevin.\u00a0\u00a0Please keep us posted.Susan",

    "question": "After going to the doctor for unexplained fatigue and blurry vision that i expected was coming from work related stress i was surprised to find out that i was positive for the HCV antibody. I have an appointment with the gastro doc next week and i am a little frustrated that i can not get the blood work done before i go. From my GP the AST/ALT was 48/83 and i tested positive for HCV. The CT was unremarkable on the liver. In going through my files my AST/ALT was elevated last year (44/71) and no one mentioned it and over the last ten years my ALT has been over 50 (in 86 it was in the 30s in rose to 51 and stayed over 50 from 89 forward). I do not drink, have no history of infusions, IVDU or multiple partners. We are terrified that our household practices (sharing of clippers, even toothbrushes in a pinch) we have infected our three children. My wife has had blood infusions 20ys ago, multiple surgeries over the years and we waiting for her results now.Does the normal CT mean that i have no liver problems?Does the eleveated ALT over the years indicate that i may have had the virus longer than i first thought?How can i tell how long i have had the virus?Does the slightly elevated AST/ALT mean that i am only newly infected? Mininumally infected?Is the bioposy the only telltale?Do i need an ultrasound for any reason or is the CT sufficient?How does diabetes fit into this (re DX and TX) I have diet controlled diabetes.How long do i have to wait on the PCR or genotype results normally?I will be 40 next year.ThanksKevin",
