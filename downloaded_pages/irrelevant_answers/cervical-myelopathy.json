Do you have a compounding illness such as diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Do you drink alcohol heavily?\u00a0\u00a0Do you have lupus?\u00a0\u00a0etc.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest that you sit down with your physician and discuss your worries and what the possible etiology of your cervical problem might be.\u00a0\u00a0Then I would take every effort in trying to correct the problem.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

            "answer": "Hi Binky,I'm sorry to hear you are having such difficulties with obtaining a correct diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0I truly understand how you feel.I am a 42 yo female, and, I, personally am dealing with a C3-4 pinched nerve due to degenerative disk disease.\u00a0\u00a0For the past year I have been being diagnosed as having a \"shoulder impingement syndrome and/or a rotator cuff syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0The and/or is dependent upon which physician I see.\u00a0\u00a0As of the week of 7/18, I was diagnosed with a completely different medical problem of which has been causing the extreme shoulder pain.\u00a0\u00a0Please talk with your physician about your concerned issues as this is extremely important, not only for treatment and healing purposes, but for your mental status as well.\u00a0\u00a0My physician wants to treat me with a \"epidural steroid injection\", of which after reading information online, I have determined it to be of great \"high risk\" for further damage in the future depending on the steroids they choose to use.\u00a0\u00a0It's very depressing to wonder if I will be, like you, on pain killers for the rest of my life.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck, and one more thing, get more than one opinion.\u00a0\u00a0I have learned that a physicians' opinions are quite different and varied.\u00a0\u00a0Also, you might check out this website: www.spineuniverse.com, as it may be able to provide you with some detailed information regarding your questions.Take care,Geckowon",

    "question": "I have been diagnosed with having cervical myelopathy.\u00a0\u00a0In doing research I find that the classical symptoms are not the ones I have.\u00a0\u00a0I have numbness in my toes and also tingling as though they were asleep.
