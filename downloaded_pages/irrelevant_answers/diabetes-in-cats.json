            "answer": "Its a good thing you are so observant and caught this early!\u00a0\u00a0Many pet owners never realize how dangerous diabetes can be.Your veterinarian will help you with a game plan for regulating her diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Some cats need insulin, others can do just as well on special diets.\u00a0\u00a0 Many veterinarians are now recommending trying to keep the cat on a grain free canned diet, but not all cats are accepting of that type of food.Beyond the information you might get here, I would recommend asking questions in our Ask the Vet expert forums here on MedHelp.\u00a0\u00a0Another good resource is caninediabetes.org.\u00a0\u00a0And yes, I know I typed canine instead of feline...but the site has resources for both species.Good luck to you!",
