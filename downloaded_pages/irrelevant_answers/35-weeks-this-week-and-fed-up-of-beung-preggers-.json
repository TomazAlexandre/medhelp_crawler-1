            "answer": "This will be my first and only child, thankfully my husband supports this.38w 3d..Sooo over this pregnancy.When I started this journey, I did not know what I was in for...(Rant coming)Gestational Diabetes is the worst.Super strict diet,what times a day to eat -scheduled meals,testing your blood all the time,insulin,exercise -which I usually don't mind, but we have between 30-35 degrees every day.. it's bloody hot! I just can't get out and about as much as I am supposed to..It cools down nicely at night, but that's when baby is active the most and sleeping is nearly impossibleMy feet and ancles are so swullen I can't tell where my legs ends and where my ancles/feet starts..Sharp needles and shooting pains comes with it too :(Putting my feet up does help, but my doctor has specificly asked me not to, as my baby's position is sunny side up and I need to sit leaned forwarded to assist baby to move into a better position.So not so great for my poor feet.Then there are some other common issues I am not comfortable talking about as well.Everything is just too much.Only to add to my misery I have this night caught a massive cold and as I have Gestational Diabetes, they will start my labor within 10days and I worry that I don't have enough time to recover from my cold...I take comfort in knowing that it is soon over.. but every day is a struggle and I feel a bit low..",
