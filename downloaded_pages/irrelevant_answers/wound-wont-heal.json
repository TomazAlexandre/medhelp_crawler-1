            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If it is a deep cut then that will take some days to heal up, need pressure bandage so that the cut edges come close or it may need wound cleaning and stitching. Otherwise there is a chance that you have diabetes which is slowing the wound healing. You need to show this to a doctor. Take care!",

Good luck!",

    "question": "Hello\u00a0\u00a0I am a 43 year old woman with a low immune system. I cut my thumb with a new knife it has been about a week and it does not look like it is getting better, I was helping my friend in her flower shop on Valentines Day. The cut is sbout a inch long and 1 or 2 cm wide I cut a slab off I could not stop the bleeding for two days. I have kept it clean and i have used antibotic cream and neosporine on it as well as kept it covered, it is painful non stop I am not sure what to do to help it heal. I do have health insurance but I have very high co-pays so I cant afford to go to hospital and Im not sure if I go to my doctors office they can help me I really want to see if there is something I can do or I could use advice on where to go hospital or doctors I cant afford to do both. Thanks in advance for your help and wisdom. Lindsey",
