            "answer": "Thanks for your comment but, the derm dr prescribed the Aldactone to help re-grow what is falling out with each shampoo.\u00a0\u00a0He did not diagnose fphl or alopecia.\u00a0\u00a0I know what both r and I think there is more going on than the fam & derm dr's scope can handle.\u00a0\u00a0I addition to the symptoms I listed in my first post, my urine has a bad odor and just 2 days ago I noticed skin tags have appeared w/seedy like scales covering them.\u00a0\u00a0The scales on my scalp r totally different.\u00a0\u00a0I feel I have picked up some airborn fungal virus that is attacking my insides or hormones and coming out my pores. The Clobex shampoo and lotion have made my scalp less red but, make more of my hair to fall out than w/baby shampoo.",

    "question": "I have been to my family doctor and he referred me to a Dermatologist. Derm doc did not even lift whats left of my hair to examine my scalp.\u00a0\u00a0After the consult, he prescribed me topical solution after solution and shampoos.\u00a0\u00a0He did give me Aldactone to help my hair grow back and, of course the hair is very fine that is coming in.\u00a0\u00a0Just like a previous person stated, dr said that haircolor is not what is affecting my condition, which was diagnosed scalp Psoriasis.\u00a0\u00a0Know one in my family has ever had any of these problems.\u00a0\u00a0I only have 1/2 my thyroid and it is testing within normal range. I, also, am having problems with diabetes, recent weight gain, memory loss, vertigo, & tinnitis.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing is really working.\u00a0\u00a0I am only 48 and I had to have a hysterectomy 10 years ago. I am wondering if any of this could be messed up hormones or immune system and what I should try that would make a difference in my condition?",
