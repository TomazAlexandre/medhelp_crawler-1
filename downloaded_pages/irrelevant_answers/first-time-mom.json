            "answer": "They have to do the blood work to assure all your levels are normal, they also do a pap and std blood work as well. As that is necessary to assure the baby doesn't come out with anything that you didn't know you had. I am on baby #2 and the worst part for me was the wait at the doctors office. Make sure you get all of your vitamins and stick with the obvious dos and don'ts of pregnancy and you should be okay. Weight gain is healthy but every one does it differently so don't assume if they tell you to cut back on sugars and drink more milk that you are getting too big too fast. They also do a nasty diabetes test during your second trimester don't eat anything before it. Don't be afraid to ask your doctor questions and express any concerns they are great and will ease your mind about anything. Hope this helped a bit and don't forget the baby shower it helps tremendously. Hope you have a good pregnancy and your child is healthy.",
