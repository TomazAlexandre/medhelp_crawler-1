            "answer": "If your blood sugars are this high and your oral meds are not working you need to ask your doctor about insulin.Blood sugars should be < 140 at all times (better 80 - 120) to avoid damage from high blood sugars.Low carb diet, exercise, weight normalisation and meds (insulin if that is what it takes) will all help.Please work on this today.",

            "answer": "When my doctor told me that I had to go on diabetes medication, blood pressure and cholesterol meds as well, I refused. I decided I would reverse my diabetes instead. I got the glucose monitor and started to take readings when i woke up and 2 hours after every meal. I read a book by Dr. Joel Fuhrman called Eat To Live, and decided to change my nutritional intake to avoid future disease and reverse my diabetes II diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0I also used a site called MyFitnessPal, and used the calorie counter. I did reverse my diabetes, blood pressure, cholesterol and lost 30 lbs. in about 9 weeks. All of this without exercise as I have a bad back. I got used to cutting the fat and sugar from my diet, pretty easily considering I was so addicted for so long. My best advice to you , is to take your life back and think about the long term effects of proper nutrition, for you and your family.\u00a0\u00a0Longevity and disease control, when becoming your first priority, is so easy and so worthwhile. Maybe check out the book, it makes a lot of sense, and Fuhrman has put a lot of recipes on Dr. Oz over the years. Good luck in achieving your goals, just please, raise the bar and considering reversing your disease.",

            "answer": "Just start exercising, count your carbs carefully, and lose some weight. I was diagnosed last year with Type II and refused to take meds (like Nighthawk61). I began to walk 7 days a week, watched my intake of carbs (try to keep it down to 35-40 per meal) and lost weight. I am now down 45 pounds and work out at a gym for 2-3 days per week. The other days, I either take a walk with my dog or do the treadmill. My A1c at diagnosis was 9.9 fasting! Now, I have an A1c of 6.4 (which my doctor states is like not being diabetic). I still keep tight control of my carbs but have worked some items back into my diet, like brown rice and wheat pasta. Like Nighthawk61 says, set your mind on reversing your disease! It can be done, I am proof of that.",
