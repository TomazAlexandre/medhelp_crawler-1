            "answer": "The cortisol shots can do a number on you... on some people they can make you cushingoid, on others, you don't recover the adrenal function from the corticosteroid blast right away and the adrenals get a vacation. Symptoms of high and low cortisol can overlap too.When the adrenals go low, you get the cruddy symptoms. ACTH though is a very difficult test to do well as in accurately as it is a fussy test.What time was that cortisol test? That is a huge factor? Also, if you are thinking this is a long term disease rather than caused by the steroid shots - not sure of the timing of shots vs tests - then many sets of tests have to be done. Diabetes endo docs are not the best at this. It takes an endo that knows adrenals - the pituitary or a good one can help you and yes, you will have to wait to get in...",

            "answer": "The test was taken around 8:30 in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0I was feeling pretty bad before the shots.\u00a0\u00a0Starting in July. The shots were on Nov 1st and then the blood tests were done on the 29th of November.\u00a0\u00a0I just didn't know if these blood tests help to answer the questions about why I was feeling so bad or if the tests were messed up because of the shots.\u00a0\u00a0No doctors seem real interested in helping and we dont have many specialists where I live.\u00a0\u00a0Is it worth a trip elsewhere or should I just keep waiting until I get better ot i get worse?",

            "answer": "The test time is appropriate which is good. Was the ACTH taken in a chilled tube and did the put the tube in the bin or the centrifuge? If it was not taken away and spun right away, the ACTH degrades in the tube.The test coming 28 days after the shots... should be ok but it is uncertain. You don't know what steroid you got but it was probably dexamethasone. Dexamethasone suppresses ACTH and has a long half life.Neuro-endos are at larger hospitals and universities and that is what you would probably need. Have tumor, will travel is kinda the motto we use... so you may have to travel. I travel a lot to get the help I need... it is not fun but necessary and I am next to a major city too!",

            "answer": "Ah yeah, it is not a common test and even though I battle to get it done correctly (to the extent that I sometimes bring in ice, or the instructions from the lab's own site, or information from a website showing the importance of centrifuge vs time) they often get uh... upset that a patient wants to tell them anything and for a whole year I got either degraded sample (grrr) or tests I know was totally incorrect since I have a sky high ACTH and degraded results lose 1000pts or so - way more than the range.I do have ringing but that was way before I had AI (mine is a result of surgical removal of my adrenals) so it is not related. I don't have any bursts for sure. I do have a lot of pain though. Cymbalta was horrible for me though.",

    "question": "In July of this year my lower back really started to hurt and i was feeling pretty low in general.\u00a0\u00a0I went to my regular GP and he ended up sending me to a spine institute.\u00a0\u00a0In October received 6 steriod injections in my lower back. To make a long story short in November I was having quite a few more problems like headaches,\u00a0\u00a0dizzyness, I haven't had a period since July, (i am a female age 41)Foot cramps, and the list goes on...A doctor friend of mine decided to do some blood work and it came back with my cortisol at 2.2 and my ACTH at < 5 and my Aldosterone at 7 low testosterone vitamin d at 6.8.\u00a0\u00a0Iam not sure where to turn we have 4 endo docs in my state and most deal with diabetes or arent taking new patients.\u00a0\u00a0Should I be concerned or do these levels come up on their own?",
