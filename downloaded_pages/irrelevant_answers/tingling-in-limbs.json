    "question": "For about a year now I have had extreme tingling in my arms and legs..normally on my right side only. When I urinate, even after hydrating like crazy, my urine is very yellow and very strong smelling.\u00a0\u00a0I have had muscle fatigue and my muscles have been twitching throughout the day esp in calves. I seem to be sore all the time and generally tired.\u00a0\u00a0my musles in my back and shoulders are always sore..like i worked them out until i couldn't take it anymore!!.....sleep does not help!! I wake up feeling as if I haven't slept in days! I've been constipated quite a few times lately too!! I just can't, for the life of me, figure out what is wrong. I'm very worried b/c I know my body and I know something is very wrong. I've gained about 5 lbs in the last couple months...I seem to always be hungry and never satisfied!!No fever..or swollen lymph nodes..no vomitting ...i just don't know.",
