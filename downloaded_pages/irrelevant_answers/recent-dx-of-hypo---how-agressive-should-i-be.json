            "answer": "3 months...I would have thought of retesting 6 weeks after initial dose. My husband was also recently diagnosed as hypo, he was started out at 25mcg, dr. had him retest after 6 weeks, then he upped his dosage to 50mcg, retested after 6 weeks, now he is stable & will retest in 1 yrs, but will stay on medicaiton of 50mcg.Too me, 3 months is too long to retest. I had thyroid issues (graves/hyper/goiter) & was always retested after a dosage change at 6 weeks.",

            "answer": "I agree with Totie...basically 4-6 weeks retesting.But you state that you are not a 'wait and see guy' and I am afraid with thyroid issues ...PAYIENCE is something you have to have lol.Many of us here have taken months , even years to get levels right.In regards to your other issues...I would be addressing them too as they may be the 'trigger' for the thyroid issues or vice versa.Diabetes meds (especially Metformin) interfere with thyroid meds so wait an hour after taking the T4 med in the morning before taking any diabetes meds or vice versa.",

    "question": "I'm a 35 yo male who just got diagnosed as hypothyroid.\u00a0\u00a0TSH was 6.29 and Free T4 was 1.0. Two years ago, I had a TSH of 2.5 (don't recall the T4).\u00a0\u00a0I've got many of the symptoms of hypo, but didn't realize it (slow metabolism, general fatigue, recently noticed my hair is a lot coarser and i've now got eczema above my eyes).I also have lots of thyroid, cholesterol and diabetes problems in the family (sister with hashimoto's, mom with thyroid surgery, etc). I have high cholesterol (untreated), and my A1C is borderline. I'm probably 30lbs overweight and can't seem to drop more than 5 lbs.My family doc put me on 25mcg of generic levothyroxine and told me we'd recheck in 3 months to see if he wanted to put me on cholesterol meds. I'm wondering if that is aggressive enough as that seems like a really low dose. .I'm not really a wait and see guy for the most part, but I'm not a hypochondriac either. Just looking for input on whether I should push him to retest sooner or up the dose. With the T4 being in the normal range (.8 - 1.8), maybe it is okay to wait three months",
