    "question": "My 68 yr old mom just went to a neurologist and they want to rule out ALS.She's had slurred speech for about a year. They found damaged blood vessels on her MRI and she has muscle loss in her hands. What hasn't been mentioned to the neurologist is that my mother is a drinker. She drinks wine every night (we don't know how much because she lives alone) and she will not live without it. Could alcohol be affecting her or could if be ALS? We are going to do additional testing but the wait for a possible death sentence is horrible. Thanks.",
