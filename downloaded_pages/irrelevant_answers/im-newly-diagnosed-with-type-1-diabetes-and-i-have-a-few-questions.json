            "answer": "Hi Patrick,My 17-year-old daughter was diagnosed at 14 and has dealt with these issues, so I'll do the best I can to answer.1. Straight alcohol actually lowers your blood sugar, which is why it can be so dangerous for diabetics-- especially because it lowers it a few hours later. So your blood sugar can drop dangerously while you're sleeping, and you wouldn't know it. I would really encourage you to talk privately with your doctor (with your parents not in the room, so you can talk honestly) about it. After I 'caught' my daughter and her friend having a beer, I let her doctor know it was time for them to talk. I respect my daughter's privacy, so I never heard what their talk was, but perhaps the doc gave her some advice on if there is a way to drink safely. I have a couple of adult friends who are type 1s and were as teens. They now can drink a beer or two or glass or wine or two with meals, in a slow way, but of course teens don't usually drink that way (I know-- I was a teenage drinker). For now, I would say absolutely avoid all alcohol-- really, it can be a life-or-death thing while your body is dealing with this-- but don't despair that you'll never be able to drink again. You might be able to eventually.2. My daughter is a competitive swimmer and a California surfer and does not want to deal with a pump, and so far (3 years) she's done great without it. Lantus has been great for her-- one shot at night, and then Novolog to cover her meals. Her A1c is awesome, and she pretty much eats what she wants, except no sugar soda. Someday she'll probably get a pump, but for now she says she doesn't want to be chained to it.3. My daughter already has her future children named, so this was a big issue for her. There is an increased risk to your children, but it's surprisingly small-- chances are still high that they WON'T get it.4. I'm not sure about this... maybe fighter pilot or astronaut, but mostly you can do anything. Type 1s are Olympic atheletes, movie stars, firefighters and everything.5. We were mystified about how our daughter got it, because there is no diabetes on either side of our huge families. What we found out a year later, when my husband's sister was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, is that autoimmune diseases (of which type 1 is) run my father-in-law's family. Various aunts have MS, Crohn's, RA, etc. Our daughter was the first diabetic. That doesn't mean it's the case with you, but it could be from some autoimmune gene somewhere distant.Finally, let me say that the first few months of my daughter's life as a type 1 were sad and difficult, but she has totally thrived and has had a great high-school life, stayed a competitive athlete, has a fun life, and has kept her blood sugar great and had no health problems at all. The fact that you're an athlete is a real bonus-- keep doing it, and it will only help you.Stay positive, and you'll be great. You probably won't feel 100% for a few weeks while you adapt, but you'll be back to your old self before you know it.",

            "answer": "1. What are the effects of alcohol on your bloodsugar? I know beer and winecoolers have a lot of Carbohydrates but things like Gin, Vodka, and Rum have none. I was wondering if I'll ever be able to have a casual drink or anything like that.They tell you not to drink at all.\u00a0\u00a0I havent drank any for about 4 years When I first found out i was diabetic i didnt know about the effects and then they didnt know to much they always if you are going to drink make sure you are eating to because it will send you sugars way up and then way way down its like a rollercoster.2. I need an opinion on shots versus an insulin pump. I cannot decide if the pump would be worth the trouble.I have been diabetic for 5 1/2 years and have had 2 children.\u00a0\u00a0I have not been able to find any thing that has worked at all till i got on the pump.\u00a0\u00a0I just got on it july 3 and i love it.\u00a0\u00a0It is totally worth it.\u00a0\u00a0I can't stress enough about the pump. but each person is diffrent. I had kinda the same situation when i found out i was type one.3. What are the chances that a child that I could potentially have when I'm older would have Diabetes?The chance of your futur children having type one are slim.\u00a0\u00a0I just had my second child.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter is 31/2 and is fine and the only thing they had was sugar issues when they were born and thats was because i was diabetic mom.\u00a0\u00a0being a dad dosent do that.4. What jobs am I no longer eligible for seeing as I have Type 1 Diabetes?Driving jobs.\u00a0\u00a0But if you want to drive truck or bus or anything like that then you just have to be incontrol for at least a year and have a doctor sign off.And when you get your license you have to be evaluated and have a form filled out.\u00a0\u00a0depending on your state.5. There is no one in either side of my family that has had type 1 diabetes. Normally I would just think that someone had it and no one knew, but my uncle is a Geneologist (Spelling haha) and has made meticulous records of my family and still nothing. How could I have gotten this?Noone in my family has it eaither it is not a history thing at all.\u00a0\u00a0You will learn more about it as you go.\u00a0\u00a0I got mine just after a surgry and put on stairods (which is a huge contributor to type one) i got sick and then my body started to attack its self and boom i had it.",
