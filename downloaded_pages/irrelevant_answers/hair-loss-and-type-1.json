            "answer": "Hi suresh,I have heard of this before, and it is not from the insulin. I am not a doctor, just the mom of a teenage type-1, so please understand that this is just what I've heard from others, not official medical advice. The causes for hair loss often stem from either thyroid trouble, which is quite common with diabetics, or the stress from the diagnosis/illness and lingering effects of high blood sugar. If it is the latter, the hair loss will diminish over time and it will grow back-- not to worry. But to rule out the former, you should probably have your thyroid checked. This same thing happened to a friend, and in his case it turned out to be his thyroid, and he responded well to thyroid medication.Congratulations on your perfect control My daughter has had excellent control for three years now (using Lantus, Novolog and her own good efforts), and we have every hope that will continue forever....",

Every time the doctor used to check my feet and he used to touch my throut and check (I think it is for thyroid check) and he did not told any thing abt thyroid. He always used to tell hair loss is due to stress.I have an appointment again this month 10'th. I will ask him about the thyroid issue.I once again thank you for the information you provided.",

    "question": "Hi, In Jan 2007, I was diagnosed for TYPE-1 diabetes with 500+ sugar reading. I am using Apidra short acting and Lantus long acting insulin. Now my sugar level is in perfect control but since sfter diagnosis, I am facing sevier hair loss. I consulted the doctor for this and he said it is due to the stress and it will be grown back. He also said it will continue for around 1 year. I am very much worried about this. Earlier I used to do daily head bath but because of this now I am doing twice a week. Is it because of the insulin I am taking.Did any one faced similar problem??Please advise me...Thanks.",
