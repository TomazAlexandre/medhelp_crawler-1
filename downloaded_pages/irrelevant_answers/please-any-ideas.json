            "answer": "Hi,Your question about elevated TSH and not taking medications causing your symptoms, the answer is yes in some cases. Elevated TSH suggests that you are hypothyroid and if you go through hypo-thyroidism,\u00a0\u00a0it suggests that you would have preference for cold and you would be slow in activity too.Hence it is necessary for you take appropriate medications and see the improvement in your symptoms.Peripheral nervous system is a group of nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.Central nervous systems consist of brain and spinal cord.NCS does not test both Peripheral nervous system and Central nervous system.Your symptom of weight loss with associated increased appetite, increase thirst and increase urine output suggests that either you might have Diabetes, Hyperthyroidism or Hyperparathyroidism.If you have associated fever then the diagnosis could be Tuberculosis and other infectious diseases.Keep me posted if you have any queries.Bye.",
