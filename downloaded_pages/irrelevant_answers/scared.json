            "answer": "Oh, well then it would be better. Not all inductions are bad, or long. Mine wasn't that bad, I was up and moving less than an hour afterwards and my son was alert and just fine as soon as he was born. With this being your second it might go by quickly and smoothly!",

            "answer": "A natural birth is via vaginal. I did get the epidural with my son. Even if you get induced and they use pitocin but you don't get pain meds, it's still natural. I know you had other plans for your delivery, but in your situation you may not have that option. Hopefully you go into labor on your own. My doctor told me that she would break my water and give it an hour or two and see if my body naturally progressed. If I don't start getting steady contractions then pitocin would come in. Maybe if you talk to your doctor they will do it tooIt's your body you have a lot more control of what will happen then most doctors let you know. Try asking about it, my sister in law had them just break her water and she started going into labor on her own. Never had to get pitocin but she did get the epidural.",
