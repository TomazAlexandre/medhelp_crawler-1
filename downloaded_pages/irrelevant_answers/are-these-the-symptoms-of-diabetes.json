            "answer": "I don't want to frighten you, neeva, but yes,\u00a0\u00a0I would see your doctor right away. Not only are those symptoms of diabetes but you might be experiencing something called ketoacidosis brought on by very high blood sugars which can land you in the hospital. If you feel as though you have the flu, you should go to an ER. But I would just call your doctor and tell him you need to be seen very quickly and request a blood sugar test.",

            "answer": "To add to Zoelula, frequent night urination can be caused by drinking fluids prior to bedtime or late at night, an overactive bladder, and on rare occasions congestive heart failure. Your other symptoms mimic hypoglycemia [low blood sugar and why you feel better after a glass of milk]. You need be checked by a doctor asap, especially considering in the back of your mind you have linked your outbreaks to diabetes. This along with your family history of diabetes makes you a great candidate to become one. If left alone and untreated, matters will only get worse. Testing for diabetes is not complicated but rather easy to do. All it takes is for you to pick up your phone and make that call to a doctor.",
