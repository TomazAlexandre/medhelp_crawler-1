            "answer": "I was diagnosed very early with gestational diabetes at 8 weeks, because of other underlining issues. I am now 28 weeks pregnant and have not had to go on medication or insulin due to diet and exercise control. Yes, it's an inconvenience to have to poke myself 4 times a day, but absolutely worth it to ensure I have a healthy pregnancy. It's been a complete lifestyle change as far as diet management, but a change that I should of made prior to getting pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I still eat whatever I feel or crave, but in moderation and I also add a lot of veggies and lean protein. I've only gained 5 pounds thus far. Good luck and just remember, it doesn't have to be a life sentence.",
