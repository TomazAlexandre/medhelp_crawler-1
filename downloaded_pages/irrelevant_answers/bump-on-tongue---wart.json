    "question": "I have had a small bump on the tip of my tongue for about 1 1/2 years.\u00a0\u00a0It has not changed size or shape, and there is definitely only one bump.\u00a0\u00a0I am worried it is a wart and have started using garlic to essentially \"burn\" it off.Neither my partner nor myself have genital warts or other oral bumps...so I'm wondering where this thing came from, and if it could be contagious.\u00a0\u00a0It makes me wonder because there is only one bump, and I haven't spread it to my partner, and it hasn't spread for me either.I have a small baby as well...don't want to infect them with anything either.\u00a0\u00a0Don't have time to go to the doctor for check-up.\u00a0\u00a0I'm wondering if since I'm irritating it that if it is a wart will it become more infectious?I guess I'm just freaking out in general, I find warts disgusting, and this one I can't put a band-aid on after treatment.\u00a0\u00a0It just has to stay open. That worries me.",
