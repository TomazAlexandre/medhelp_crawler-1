            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.In that case the swelling and dizziness may not be related. If your symptom of dizziness is relieved by eating something, indicates that you might be having episodes of hypoglycemia. Inadequate sleep can also cause tiredness, fatigue and dizziness. Other causes for these symptoms are; brain disorders heart problems, fever, stress, low blood pressure and anxiety.It could be due to postural hypotension, where in upon standing blood pooling occurs in the legs and the brain is deprived of adequate blood supply and oxygenation.\u00a0\u00a0This is more common in the elderly and in people with diabetes mellitus.Please consult your GP who will examine you and may ask for blood tests for evaluating blood sugar and CBC.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "i have a bump behind my left ear that is swollen. since i have gotten this i have fallen over, blacked out, thrown up, got a runny nose and a sore throat. ive been to many different doctors my ears nose and throat look normal. they have ruled out that it is a cyst or a swollen lymph node. the also ruled out that it isnt cancerous from the ct scan. i thought it was going away, but it came back again. its gotten bigger and the symptoms are coming back. hard. i get severely dizzy and no over the counter medicine will help and neither does the prescription medicine. i have no energy. it puts me out of breath moving laundry from the washer to the dryer. i have missed many days of school. and today, while i was eating, every time i chewed, there was a squishy noise in my ear and mild discomfort in my jaw. there is nothing in the ear and i just recently went to the dentist and nothing is wrong with my teeth. can anyone give me an answer?",
