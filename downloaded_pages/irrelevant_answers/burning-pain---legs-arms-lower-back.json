            "answer": "Hi,How are you?It is quite possible that your symptoms are due to nerve compression in the cervical region and back.Other causes can be peripheral neuropathy like diabetes and Vitamin B12 deficiency.MS and fibromyalgia also cannot be ruled out.I am afraid but you need to see a neurologist at your earliest. Meanwhile please take an OTC B12 supplement and see if it helps.Take care!",

    "question": "For the last few months I have been dealing with severe burning pains in my thighs/arms and some of my lower back. Sometimes my toes and fingers get a bit numb. Legs feel extremely heavy, especially at night. Pain killers are ineffective. The pain is worse at night, and sometimes in the morning. Progresses during the day at work until I get home and relax. Weakness in my knees and hands (Keep dropping things for really no reason at all). Also I tend to get headaches quite a bit - especially in the morning. Chest pain just left of my sternum.A few of my past problems:About 4 years ago I ended up with a bulging disc (L5/S1) which eventually caused severe foot drop (I could not pick up my toes or lift my ankle up - basically all upward motion of my right leg was gone). This lasted for about 3 months and eventually resolved on its on though I still suffer from back pain.I have had a history of spontaneous pneumo thorax (3 to be exact) and 1 spontaneous pneumo mediastinum - havent had one in almost 4 years though.",
