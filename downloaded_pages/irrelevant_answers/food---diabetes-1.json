            "answer": "I am so sorry to hear what you are going through with your son.\u00a0\u00a0I know how hard controlling b.g. can be and how heartbreaking it is as a Mom when our kids feel miserable and end up needing more medical help.My DS will be 15 this month.\u00a0\u00a0He's been Type 1 for 8.5 years.\u00a0\u00a0He is on an insulin pump, using Novolog.\u00a0\u00a0Does your son do injections or a pump?My DS eats OK. He eats more junk than I'd like at times, but he's a kid and even his endo says that they are teens, will not make the best food choices and just need to make sure they are taking insulin to cover the carbs.Maybe his meal bolus or basal amounts of insulin need to be tweaked?\u00a0\u00a0Could he be forgetting to take his insulin, or not taking it at the right time?\u00a0\u00a0I'm asking this because back int he fall, my DS had his b.g.'s all over the place.\u00a0\u00a0Part of the prob was that he was \"remember late\" to take insulin for what he ate.\u00a0\u00a0So maybe 20-30 minutes after snacking on cookies, he'd take his insulin.\u00a0\u00a0We increased his meal insulin doses, and he's doing better at trying to remember to bolus before he starts eating.",
