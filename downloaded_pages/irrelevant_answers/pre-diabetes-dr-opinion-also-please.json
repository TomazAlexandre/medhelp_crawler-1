    "question": "hello. I could really use some advice. Both my parents have type 2 diabetes they were diagnosed in their 50's. I am 26 years old and have always had a blood sugar level somewhere in the 90 range. Over the holidays just for fun I checked my sugar using my mother's glucoseometer and it was 160! I have never had it this high so I borrowed an extra monitor my mom had and tested my self over a couple of days. The first day I ate like\u00a0\u00a0I normally would, my level started out normal but by mid afternoon was up to 150 then back to about 100 by bed time. The next day I payed more attention to what I ate and my glucose stayed under 120. I have also had BV for about 2 years now and I have heard that infections can also raise glucose levels. Should I be concerned?\u00a0\u00a0I know I should just go to the doctor and have them test me but I can't really afford it right now, esp. if this is just me being paranoid. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks!",
