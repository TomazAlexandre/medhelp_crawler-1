            "answer": "Nope, I'm in Oregon, a looonnnng ways away LOL Thanks for the kind words. Should be able to get report on x-rays either tomorrow or Friday. Receptionist wasn't too receptive to my having a copy, but my dr had written right on the order that I could have a copy. Will let you all know how it goes. Haven't heard back from Cardiologist yet to schedule an appt. I suppose that will take a couple of weeks, then more to work into their schedule. We could all pass on before doctors get around to seeing us!\u00a0\u00a0Have a good evening.",

    "question": "Update on doctors appointment....Saw my PCP today, and told him about my rapid heart rate episode on Sunday night. Heat issues, etc. After examining me, he found that my heart murmur is back. 3 1/2 yrs ago an EKG done in ER due to rapid heart rate episode found that I have an enlarged right ventricle. The upshot is that he is referring me to a Cardiologist for a workup. Mr dcotor said my sx of leg pain, feet & ankle swelling, and intolerance for climbing stairs could be heart related. My Dad passed away 3 years ago with a massive heart attack. I'm overweight, smoke (yeah, I know) and other health issues, but this one slapped me along side the head. I am scheduled for lung & heart X-rays tomorrow. PCP is putting off referral to rheumatologist until after Cardiac consult, as he feels this is a more important issue, since my last bloodwork came back with very high reticulocyte count, and high ferritin. Also have highC-Peptide and CRP highly sensitive was 4.8.Extremely high, which is Cornary Heart Disease risk. How much more can go wrong in one person! I'm on ToprolXL for the rapid heart rate, so shouldn't have had 2 episodes in 6 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Yikes! The only good thing is my blood pressure.LOL Any words of encouragment greatly appreciated!\u00a0\u00a0Hope you are feeling well today Doni.......Maggie",
