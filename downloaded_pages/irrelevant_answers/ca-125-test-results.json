            "answer": "Hi! I agree with Vixen and Gatsby. I was told by the head of a dept at Cleveland Clinic, that ca125 in PRE-MENOPAUSAL women is an unreliable test. I do not know anything about transplants or rejection drugs but check with your doctor about the unreliability of this test. GOod Luck",

            "answer": "My CA-125 was 900 pre-op but there was also a 12 cm mass on my ovary as well as some other spots on the CT scan so it was pretty clear what I was looking at. I was seated with tumors, stage 3C. My CA is now down to 14. Women in my chemosuite have had CAs of as high as 15,000! Obviously, it fluctuates greatly.",

    "question": "I am a 35/F with a history of Diabetes/Kidney/Pancreas transplant.\u00a0\u00a0I recently went to my OB for my annual exam and because a CT scan suggested I might have a cyst on my ovaries.\u00a0\u00a0My dcotor suggested that they also draw a test for my CA-125 level because of not having regular menstrual cycles.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well all my other test results and the biopsy they did came back fine except my CA-125 level, it came back at 682.\u00a0\u00a0I was informed that it could possibly be because of some of the rejection drugs I'm on that could elevate this level.\u00a0\u00a0All the information I've read on this level relates to the possibility of having Ovarian Cancer.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor informed me to see a surgeon which I have scheduled for next week.\u00a0\u00a0I was reading information on your web site and was curious if I should be more concerned about the level being 682?\u00a0\u00a0My doctor didn't seem to concerned about it.\u00a0\u00a0All the articles I've read seem to talk about this level, but not being that high.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what other symptoms to look for but I did make an appt. with an Oncologist to see if they could give me any more information.\u00a0\u00a0It seems like everytime I have something that comes back abnormal, everyone seems to want to relate it to my transplant or the rejection drugs I'm on.\u00a0\u00a0I think there might be something more to it than that.\u00a0\u00a0Any information on what this test result being this high could mean would be helpful.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!",
