    "question": "What NOT to do with your old carpet protector with the sharp nubs on the bottom. Miine cracked, so this morning I replaced it with a new one, putting the old one in the front room, with the sharp points up so it wouldn't make marks on the floor until I could get it down to the dumpster.\u00a0\u00a0An hour or so goes by, and I'm scurring around getting ready for work. Interject here, I sometimes put my clothes out of the dryer on the couch so I can fold them while watching TV.I'm in just in my undies, so run out to the frontroom to grap a shirt.........Yep, stepped right on the sharp points. Flailing around, I fell straight down onto the sharp points, puncturing my hand in multiple places, and my left foot, taking the skin off and puncturing it also. The only way to get off of it was to roll off. I know have 4 rows of the puncture pattern on my hip. As I lay there wincing in pain, as I twisted my back and neck while falling, I'm thanking my lucky stars there was no-one to see me do something so stupid! Tonight my back hurts, as well as my hand, hip, and foot. I look like a 3 year old let loose with a box of band-aids. Hopefully this will give you all a good laugh.I don't heal fast from cuts due to my type 2 diabetes, so I have a visual of my being 3-4 months with an interesting patter on my hip. A very hard way to get a tattoo!\u00a0\u00a0And the darn thing is still in my frontroom! But I did turn it over.....hugs to all......Maggie",
