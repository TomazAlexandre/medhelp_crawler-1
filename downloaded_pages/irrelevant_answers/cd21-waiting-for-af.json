LOL I usually feel sore bbs after O but I have nothing. I have been getting twinges and crampy episodes here and there but that's been happening this whole cycle...since CD7!!I woke up yesterday morning with a sore throat and have been nauseous the last 2 days but I think it's from being sick! I hate taking things for it just because of the possibility.",

    "question": "well, im on cd21, and i know shes on her way! got sore bbs, a bit tender than normal and had slightly swollen tummy but again putting them both down to AF, been having some really dizzy spells lately though and my dad is diabetic so when AF arrives and i can rule out pregnancy i think i might go and get tested for diabetes. :S\u00a0\u00a0One thing that is making me rule out pregnancy this month is that ive had no cramping or any twinges so doesnt look too promising :(\u00a0\u00a0anybody else on the last week wait?",
