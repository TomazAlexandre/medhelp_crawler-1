You certainly have my sympathy!",

            "answer": "I personally haven't tried this but I have read alot about COLLIDAL SILVER.Its good for many things internal and external and safe to use, its avail from most health outlets or homeopathic stores.I HAVE been using it on my cat for an autoimmune disease he has, he gets open sores on his face and one dab clears them right up. I also have given him a few drops orally to boost his immune system.Perhaps your thrush has become resistant to the antibiotics your doctor keeps giving you?good luck",

    "question": "I have had oral thrush on my tongue since march 2007 until now (8th July 2010). I am constantly\u00a0\u00a0going to my doctor ( every month, even every few weeks at times)\u00a0\u00a0but every time I see someone they just fob me off with antibiotics. I have taken nystatin, fungilin lozenges, oral-base, amoxicillin, dactarin, corsodyl, pennicillin, salt water, another green mouthwash (cant remember the name of it), corlan pellets (hydrocortisone) and the list goes on but it just gets more aggresive. I am now 25 and have been suffering almost constantly since I was 21. I am definetly aware that this is weakening my immune system but I don't know what to do as these doctors keep ignoring this condition. I am begging you PLEASE HELP ME!!!",
