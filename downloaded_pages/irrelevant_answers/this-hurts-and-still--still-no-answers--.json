No he is not a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0He has good periferal pulses in both lower extermities so no Physician as ever wanted to have and flow studies done. When I was a practicing nurse I\u00a0\u00a0assisted patients in the hospital with the same complaints. Unfortunely I have never heard any Physician, my husband or otherwise, utter any advise other than that there isn't anything that they can do.\u00a0\u00a0I know that it is not encouraging, but please know that you are not alone.",
