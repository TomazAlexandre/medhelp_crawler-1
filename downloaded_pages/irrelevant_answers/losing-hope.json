    "question": "So I am 32+4 and newly diagnosed with gestational diabetes. I have been super strict about the diet that they gave me but my numbers are still high. My doctor may want to put me on an oral medication. The problem is as soon as I start the medications I am considered \"high risk\". I can no longer see my midwife and usually there is pressure to induce or have a cesarean. I had natural unmedicated childbirth with DS and SO wanted that for my DD. I am losing hope for a normal birth. :(",
