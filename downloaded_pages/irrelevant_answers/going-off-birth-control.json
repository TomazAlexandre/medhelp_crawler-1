            "answer": "Thank you for tips. Seen doctor twice now, finally ordered full blood panel, which will check thyroid. A nerve conduction test will also be set up. Getting more numb in hands every day. Some fingers just don't even bother waking up at all now. It all seemed to hit so suddenly. I probably missed the little signs. Currently on blood pressure meds and have been for 5-6 years now. A water pill was added but not helping much with swelling. Hope to get blood results soon and nerve test set up as well.",
