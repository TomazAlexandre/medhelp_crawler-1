The answer is no it's the other way around, uncontrolled diabetes will cause low HDL levels, among other things.You need to speak with your doctor for clarification. Zocor and Crestor are both used to reduce LDL cholesterol and triglycercides not raise HDL levels. Also ask your doctor for an A1c [hemoglobin A1c] test to see how well you are controlling your glucose levels and whether your lifestyle has made you a candidate for diabetes.",
