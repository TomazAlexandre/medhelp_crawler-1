            "answer": "4L is approximately the equivalent of one gallon and that is exactly what my midwife advised me to drink at my last prenatal.\u00a0\u00a0There shouldn't be risk of overhydration if you're following an exercise regimen and sipping the water throughout the day. My sister in law is a personal trainer/body builder and claims that water should be constantly going in an ounce or two at a time. I.e. not chugging water bottles or drinking it all in one sitting.",
