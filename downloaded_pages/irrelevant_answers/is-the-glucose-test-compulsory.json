            "answer": "I would suggest getting it done. I got mine done at a regular appointment. I drank the drink first thing, then had my regular appointment, and by that time, there wasn't a ton of time left to wait. I'm sure you could bring things to occupy your little one. My 5 year old stepson came with me to that appointment and he was fine.",

    "question": "I am 27 weeks pregnant and I have been given the form to get the glucose blood test (the 1 hour long one). My question is is this compulsory? I have a 20 month old who sleeps from noon til 3pm most days. And I just don't have the time to get it done. No one can look after him while I get it done and the place where it is has no toys or books or anything to entertain him for 1 whole hour.",
