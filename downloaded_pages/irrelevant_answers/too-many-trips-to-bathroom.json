            "answer": "Not a doctor here.\u00a0\u00a0That said, it could be several things I can think of.If it's a UTI you may experience pain or burning on urination and possibly a fever.I'll note that there's a possibility it could be the onset of Type II diabetes (do you feel any fatigue, increased thirst, etc?).Could just be a weak bladder too.Too bad you have to wait 2 weeks, could you get in to see the GP sooner?\u00a0\u00a0A GP should be able to check you for both a UTI and diabetes.Best of luck,",

    "question": "42 y.o healthy male 6'2\" 180 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0Cannot get in to see urologist for 2 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms over the past week include:-increased feelings to urinate resulting in many trips to bathroom.- when I urinate, I only go small amounts, unless I hold until bladder is fairly full.- I can hold without pain.- the feelings to urinate appear to come fron inside the shaft (urethra?) as opposed to the abdomen, except when I really I have a full bladder.- Urgency returns shortly after trips to restroom.- when I have these feelings to urinate, it also feels like I am dribbling to the point where I check often.\u00a0\u00a0However, there is no noticaeble dribble on white underwear.-No pain in abdomen or anywhere for that matter- urine is generally clear and no blood, although over the past few weeks I have noticed it to be cloudy in the middle of the day.- noticed strong oder in urine after empying a full bladder this morning.\u00a0\u00a0However, I started myself on some of my wife's Amoxil (1000 mg last night, so I don not know if the odor came from the Amoxil)Was better yesterday, but sympoms have returned.- as part of a PCP checkup 2 months ago, my bloodwork was fine, only with a very slighly elavated bilirubin, which has since gone\u00a0\u00a0to the upper end of the normal range.\u00a0\u00a0Prostate bloodwork was fine.I believe this may be a mild lower UTI, although urine has mostly been clear.I have also treid cranberry juice dailyThanks for your thoughts and comments.",
