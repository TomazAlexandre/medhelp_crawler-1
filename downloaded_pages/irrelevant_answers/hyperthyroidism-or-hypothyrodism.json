            "answer": "From Wikipedia:HypothyroidismHigh levels of TSH indicate that the thyroid is not producing sufficient levels of Thyroid hormone (mainly as thyroxine (T4) and smaller amounts of triiodothyronine (T3)).HyperthyroidismA low TSH indicates that the pituitary gland is being inhibited by increased levels of T4 and/or T3 in the blood, and is therefore a reliable marker of hyperthyroidism.There are no doctors on this forum to assist you with medication dosages, only your PCP can answer this since he/she has your medical records for consulting and we don't.This is diabetes forum yet there are no mention of diabetes anywhere in your post. If you have diabetes type 2, \" I have recently gained 15 lbs, but I have been eating donuts and twinkies lately, not for my entire diet, but as snacks at night.\" is unhealthy even as snacks. When was the last time you had your glucose checked by a doctor? And what is your diabetes question?",

            "answer": "Hi,there is a thyroid forum on here also and they are very helpful.Just go back to the main page and scroll down till you see thyroid.You'll need to post your TSH and FT3 and FT4 results there and you'll get feedback.\u00a0\u00a0TSH alone is not enough to evaluate what's going on given your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0However generally if TSH is low (as yours now is) you would need to slightly decrease your thryoid meds.You do need to get off the donuts for shacks though (they could explain the weight gain) or you really may need this diabetes forum in the near future.Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Oh, there's also something wrong with the TSH range you stated.\u00a0\u00a0Normally it would range from about 0.5 up to about 3.5 (some labs still use 5.0), or thereabouts, depending on the lab.",
