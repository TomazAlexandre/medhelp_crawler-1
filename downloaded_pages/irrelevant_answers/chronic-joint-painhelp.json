            "answer": "Hi!Generally a high ANA titre indicates an autoimmune disease (SLE, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, scleroderma, polymyositis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, dermatomyositis, primary biliary cirrhosis, Addison disease, Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus). Mixed connective tissue disorders also cause a high ANA. What is important is the pattern of ANA staining: homogenous, speckled, or nucleolar. Depending on the pattern of ANA staining, other antibody tests will have to be done. The pattern of staining itself is quite diagnostic (for eg in SLE a homogenous pattern is seen, nucleolar pattern in scleroderma and speckled pattern in ITP and mixed connective tissue disorder and in lupus).\u00a0\u00a0Discuss this with your doctor and get yourself further examined in this line. Take care!",

            "answer": "Dr. Mathur,My initial testing showed ANA Antibodies of 15 with the IU/ml method of reporting -- Titer method would be 1:80 - 1:320. ANA Pattern says: Homogenous; speckled pattern also detected.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor seems to think it is not auto-immune and further testing not needed.\u00a0\u00a0Do you agree?",

    "question": "For the past couple of years I have had pain in the joints of BOTH shoulders.\u00a0\u00a0I still have my strength, just a chronic ache that seems especially worse at night.\u00a0\u00a0Also hurts when reaching behind my back or lifting things.I went to ortho doctor and had xrays and MRI...all negative.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, unusual to have an ortho issue equally in both shoulders.\u00a0\u00a0Lately, I have also had occasional aching in hips and right elbow.Blood test showed slightly evelvated ANA, so I went to Rheumatologist.\u00a0\u00a0He looked at test results and said he does not think it is auto-immune at all and gave me Meloxicam for inflammation (has not helped at all).\u00a0\u00a0No additional testing or blood work was done.\u00a0\u00a0He noted some physical therapy, but that has not helped either.Can anyone offer any guidance?\u00a0\u00a0Could it be something else altogether?\u00a0\u00a0I am only 46, and do not think I should have this chronic aching all the time.\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate any guidance you can offer.",
