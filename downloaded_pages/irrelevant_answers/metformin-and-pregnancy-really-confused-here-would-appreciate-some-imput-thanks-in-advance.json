            "answer": "Thank you both so much, that all makes very good sense, I will get back on them, as I will be planning an at home water birth, I don't want to have such a big baby! I was on it because diabetes runs heavily in my family, and I had gained 36 lbs in the last year and a half without an explanation as to why, *I eat pretty good, fat free, low sugar and exercise regularly* so my doc put me on metformin and she knew that I was going to have my reversal done soon, I'm sure she would have said something, but when I asked her about whether it would hurt the baby and if I should discontinue use if I got pregnant she didn't answer me. *shrugs* maybe she didn't hear me. Anyways, Thank You both so much!! Now I won't be so paranoid.",

    "question": "Hello everyone,I'm really confused here, I've recently (within the last 6 months) been diagnosed as being pre-diabetic, my doc put me on metformin (generic for glucophage). Then about a month later I got my tubal reversed, had to wait 6 weeks, 85% chance of conceiving. So.. I quit taking all medications with fear that it would some how affect my baby if and when we got pregnant, one doc suggested i stop while the other never did answer me so I quit anyway. I have been reading on here that some women are taking metformin to help in * I assume* getting pregnant??\u00a0\u00a0Am I reading wrong and did I stop taking my medication for the wrong fears?? I thought it was just for diabetics and not good for you when you were TTC?? Please help. I was taking 500 MG daily.",
