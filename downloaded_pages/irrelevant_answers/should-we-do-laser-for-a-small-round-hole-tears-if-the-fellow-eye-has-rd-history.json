            "answer": "Dr Oyakawa,Thanks a lot for your info. I personally don't want to do the laser the risk as you said there 5% complication. Another reason is as you said, only a very small percentage of detachment is caused by round hole tear.But I the retinal specialist I saw 3 weeks recommend the laser only because I have the RD in the left eye.That 's why I would like to look at the stat. The statistic I looked at also express in terms of per year. It said regular person have around 0.005% chance of detachment PER YEAR. What is the chance of RD for people like us (had RD before). 10 times higher ? or 100 times higher?I also want to understand the risk so as to evaluate if I need to buy some serious-illness insurance.Thanks again",

    "question": "Dr Oyakawa,You mentioned that you will definitely not do the laser for the round-hole tears. Do you refer to normal people or including people like me have RD in the fellow eye? I saw statistics saying the RD rate of people in North America is 0.3% (or 1/300) during the life time. What is the theoretical RD rate of my right eye given the fact that I have RD in the left eye? Is it more close to 5% or 15%?I am thinking if the RD rate is around 5% and the laser can lower the rate a bit to let say 3 or 4 %, I may rather wait until there is a symptom.I am going to see the Retinal specialist tomorrow and like to prepare a bit better.Thanks a lot",
