            "answer": "Cut the quantity of liquid back, you can still give her a drink,just not as much, fruit juice can make the urine acidic. Give her more plain filtered water. If she has seen the doctor I doubt it is diabetes but you can always ask for a check on that . It is in your hands to cut it back,I remember having a similar problemwith my child, once I changed from the bottle to the sippy cup she drank less ,so make a start on getting her off the bottle that will help more than anything, if you give her this amount to drink you will have a problem when it comes to potty training and her sleeping dry through the night best to start now..Goood luck",

    "question": "Can anyone help? My 2yr old drinks excessively and I go through about 10 nappies a day and they are always bursting. Im in the process of toilet training and she does use the toilet but not the potty but if I put a nappy on her its normally full within the hour. She does not eat much but I do give her a varied diet she manages to eat half a weetabix and a slice of toast for her breakfast but she has a bottle of milk when she wakes then a watered down juice just before breakfast. Lunch is normally pasta or a cheese sandwich with grapes plusshe has had about a further 3 drinks and tea is normally what we are having. I have tried to cut down on her drinking but she continously asks for them. Have given her water between juice and she drinks it straight away so I know she is thirsty. Have spoken to my doctor who said dont worry she looks healthy and she certainly not underweight she is quite tall for her age. Should I worry oh and her urine and sometimes her stools are very acidic and often burn her skin.",
