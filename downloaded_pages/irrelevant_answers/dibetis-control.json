            "answer": "Hello,sounds like you have severe insulin resistance to be on this much insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Are you also taking metformin. Please ask your dr about this, it may help if it is suitable as it is an insulin sensitising medication.My best advice to you would be to get on a very low carb diet (ketogenic), as this will help you control your blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0basically no sugars in your diet and carbs come from non-starchy veges, nuts, a little dairy.Look up Richard Bernstein \"Diabetes Solutions\".Basal Bolus approach (separate fast and long acting insulin) is going to give you better control that the 70/30.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have a carb-insulin ratio.\u00a0\u00a0You need to dose fast acting insulin appropriately to cover carbs/protein at each meal.other good books are Using Insulin - By John WalshandThink Like a Pancreas.Don't worry how much insulin you need to take. Just take what you need to keep your blood sugars more stable.",

            "answer": "Thanks, I have gone to almost 180 units a day and still really have not got great control, although my a1c dropped down to 7.3, my biggest problem is that I cannot take metformin as it causes acidosis and have tried twice with the same result (made me really sick) tried actos and did not help at all, I was born with a rare congenital problem of only the head of the pancreas, so I was doomed from the start and then the hep c tx did not help on diabetes side at all, although funny that while on tx blood sugar stayed good. go figure. I think I will try to switch to the long and short seperate, do you recommend humulin or humulog ? what has the best results, right now on humulin.",
