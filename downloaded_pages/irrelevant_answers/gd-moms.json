            "answer": "I had gestational diabetes with my 2nd pregnancy. They tested me at 24 weeks and my sugar was at 133 which is borderline and they didn't say anything and then when my son kept measuring really big at my ultrasounds they made me do a 3 hour test at 35 weeks which came back positive. My sugar stayed normal but I wound up having an 11 lb 13 Oz baby via c-section! That was the most traumatic experience of my life!!",

            "answer": "This is my 3rd pregnancy and first time diagnosed at 26,weeks and I am 32 weeks now. My belly measured 4 weeks ahead and was sent to high risk OB and ultrasound showed baby is measuring right on schedule but I have extra fluid around her due to gd which makes my belly measure big. My fasting sugars are 90-100 and 2 hour below 120. I recently started insulin. Everything is going well I can't complain as long as baby is healthy, all is well. Try not to stress and do what you need to do to have a healthy baby. If you have concerns don't hesitate to share with OB. I'm here if you any other questions",
