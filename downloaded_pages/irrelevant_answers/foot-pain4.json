    "question": "My husband has a pain on bottom of his foot(around the arch)It is very painful when walking and to the touch, I have tried heat wrap and tried cold wrap, but does not seem to help. He is diabetic and has 2 insulin shots per day. There is also a small\u00a0\u00a0spot where it is sore on his foot. Is there anything else I can do to help him? Also\u00a0\u00a0gave him a foot massage, because I thought it could be his blood not getting through. Then if it wasn't it would turn purple. I hope you can help,Thank you Anucker",
