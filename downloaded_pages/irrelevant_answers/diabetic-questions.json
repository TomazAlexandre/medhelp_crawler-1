            "answer": "Your doctor would have to do specific antibody tests to see if you have the Type 1 antibodies. Type 2's don't have them. But generally Type 1 comes on more suddenly and strongly than Type 1; there are exceptions to this. Some information that would make it more likely for either type would be age, weight and whether you have another immune disorder such as thyroid; but again, only testing will clearly diagnose.",

            "answer": "Well I just got my test results back. It showed that I have no antibodies at all for diabetes. So that pretty much means that I'm not developing type 1 diabetes right? But when I took the glucose test, my fasting test came out pretty low and then 2 hours later I drank a glucola then took the next test and that made sugar level go up pretty high. My face is pale, I have muscle weakness, very chronic fatigue, and mild sort throat at times! Judging by this information, please tell me what does it sound like I have?????????????????????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

            "answer": "I'm not a doctor and nobody can diagnose you online. What did your doctor say about the results of your tests? If he did not discuss this at length with you, including the next steps, I would make an appointment to do so or look for another doctor. He should not leave you hanging.Having said that, yes, not having antibodies points to Type 2. If your OGTT result was pretty high (what were the numbers?) that does indicate diabetes.Some people have normal or close to normal fasting but high post prandials (after meals) Do you have a meter for home testing? I would suggest getting one and then testing at different times such as fasting and two hours after a meal. This not only shows your level of blood sugar but also shows you the effect of different foods so you can change your diet to keep your blood sugar in range. This diet change, plus exercise and losing weight if you need to can control your blood sugar and if not then your doctor will prescribe one or more oral meds. I suggest you talk to your doctor as well as read up some on diabetes.",

            "answer": "I understand your not a doctor. Listen I've been seeing a doctor and I've been taking blood tests to see what's wrong with me. I already have a meter and my numbers come out 85, 86, 87, 88, which is completely normal, it's not too high and it's not too low. Yes, I have changed my diet, well I've always ate healthy, but now I'm eating much more healthy. I'm not asking you to diagnose me or prescribe me medicine. I'm just asking your opinion on what it sounds like I have. Even if you're not a hundred percent sure, just say what you think. My health has been changing. Now, my stomach sometimes makes more weird noises and whenever I go on a plane, ship, or rollercoaster I get Motion Sick.",
