            "answer": "Dear LLWBI never had a good relation with the surgeons because I always believed in conservative managements for a good time esp if diabetic , since it affects the small vessels supplying blood to the spine and may affect the healing plus a higher chance of infection.First , at this point I will at least cast\u00a0\u00a0a doupt on the fibromyalgia with all these degenerative changes.you wrote MYELOPATHY?\u00a0\u00a0myelopathic symptoms are\u00a0\u00a0motor symptoms, or bowel and bladder abnormalities , which is generally accepted as an indication for surgical therapy, esp if\u00a0\u00a0severe or progressing , otherwise surgery could be delayed if the person is manifesting improvement in the neurologic deficit.I dont see any line about the confirmation of a root damage by doing EMG/NCS??What did you try for the pain and for how long?Epstein's (one the major reviews 1989) clinical review of\u00a0\u00a0more than 1300 patients with cervical spondylitic myelopathy were put\u00a0\u00a0in a conservative treatment evaluation that 36% showed improvement, whereas 64% showed no improvement . In those who did not improve, 26% deteriorated neurologically, with the remainders remaining stable.the believe in the 1960s (I cant remember the name of the reviwer) was long periods of a neurologic stabilization occur between episodes of deterioration...which all add to try a consevative way as long as possibleAbout your Q of the prognosis the 2 most important factors for successful surgical\u00a0\u00a0outcome in patients treated for cervical spondylitic myelopathy are1-the patient's age and2-the duration of symptoms.Young patients tend to do better than elderly patients. And those who's disease has been present for fewer than 6 months have a more favorable outcome than patients whose symptoms have been present for 1 year.If you are able to delay the surgery you should1-have strict control of the diabetes, a plan to lose weight2- Ask your surgeon about the chance of have the new less invasive surgery called The X STOP Interspinous Process Distraction System (IPD)Bob",

            "answer": "Thank you for your insights Bob. I too have been questioning if my pain is from the degenerative changes or if in fact I do have fibromyalgia. I do not have the typical fibro fog reported by many. I got my NCS and EMG results today, with nerve root irritation noted at C5-6. Weakness in left biceps and bilateral median neuropathies of the wrists.Lower extremity showed slow tendency to respond to vibratory testing over the feet and great toes. I have been on anti-inflammatories since 1991 injury. I was put on additional antiinflammatories in December when the low back pain started. I cannot take opiod pain maedications except at night and on weekends, as I drive\u00a0\u00a08 hrs a day for my job. But I have had to recently increase the dosage of Vicodiene from 1- 500mg tablet to 2, at night, to relieve the pain. My osteopathic physician is referring me to a neurosurgeon for a consultation. I will ask him about the IDP surgery you mentioned. My lower back pain is only 3 months duration, but the neck/upper back has been ongoing for probably at least 10 years off and on. Any other insights re the EMG/NCS will be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for responding to my post.",

    "question": "I have moderately severe left foraminal stenosis at C3-4, a large herniated nucleus pulposus at C5-6 causing moderate left foraminal stenosis, mild to moderate central stenosis C5-6 and C6-7 with moderate uncinate hypertrophy at C6-7 resulting in moderte bilateral foraminal stenosis, These are MRI results. I also have\u00a0\u00a0a central disc bulge at T7-8, and at L4-5 mild central stenosis due to combination of facet and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy amd broad based disc bulge. X-rays showed osteophytes at most levels in thoracic spine. I have headaches, neck pain, shoulder pain, numbness in thumb and pointer finger. Pain at mid back, and lower back pain, with radiating pain in buttock and all way down left leg. If the neurosurgeons fuse the multi-levels in my neck, will my neck be stiff? And will they work on neck and lumbar at the same time? I drive for a living 8 hours a day, and can't be off work forever. Or is this going to disable me? Please, anyone with any answers, help! If surgery is in my future as I expect it is, any ideas how long of a recovery period? Thank you for any help you can give me. I also have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, 16 of 18 pressure points, and type II diabetes.",
