            "answer": "Hi.I was just wondering if you damaged your spine when you tripped over the toy. You could have a small bulge in the intervertebral disc in the lumbar area. You should get it checked. An MRI of the lumbar spine would be helpful.Your anxiety about MS is quite apt. But you should not let that anxiety take you over. You could find out any stress issues, either at home of at work, since you have a full time job.Hope you are otherwise doing well. Has your little one been developing fine ?Regards",

    "question": "I'm 26 years old. My mother has Multiple Sclerosis and my father has Diabetes (great combination, I know). I live a fairly healthy lifestyle; I'm a mother of a 14 month old. I drink a lot of water, take my vitamins and eat a lot of vegetables. I don't exercise a LOT, but I do some crunches and push ups about 3 times a week and I irish dance when I can.So here's the thing...Last summer, I slipped on my son's toy and fell and hit my knee in the shower. That night, my foot fell asleep and it was hard to \"wake it up,\" per se. Since then, the top of that foot and around the ankle has lost some feeling. I wouldn't say it's numb, but it's getting there. I had 8 stitches the summer before in that ankle, so I thought maybe it could relate to that. The loss of feeling hasn't moved or gotten worse. But now, my other foot is falling asleep more frequently and tingling. I've had a LOT of fatigue lately. I'm a mother with a full-time job. I went to the doctor, and they did some blood tests. She said that I \"needed to wear different shoes and lose a few pounds...I could be pressing on a nerve.\" I'm 5'11\" and 175...I need to drop about 5 more pounds to be pre-baby weight, but I am by NO MEANS in need of weight loss. I am concerned, given my family history. I feel like she was stumped and just pushed me out the door. I have a child to think about, and I'm really worried.I am thinking about getting a second opinion. Any thoughts? Suggestions?",
