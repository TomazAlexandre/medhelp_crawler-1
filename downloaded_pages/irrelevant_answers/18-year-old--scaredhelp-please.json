            "answer": "You're at an age where you can see a doctor without being accompanied by an adult or guardian like your mother. Since we get a lot of visitors from around the world its best to check with your local laws first.Dark, odorous urine can have several meanings besides diabetes; one is poor diet, others are kidney or liver issues. Only a doctor can determine the true nature of your problem, if any. Go see a doctor asap, have a checkup, and stop playing guessing games where your health and well being is concerned.",

    "question": "Hi. I'm an eighteen year old male, and i'm having a thought that I may have diabetes. I have checked some of the symptoms online and a couple of them match up, similar to what i'm going through. I saw that it can make you urine darker, and have a sort of oder to it. For a little while now, when I urinate, that happens. It's a dark yellow color, and it has somewhat of a strange oder, not horrible or anything, but it's noticable. I also had an anxiety attack last night. I was shaking and my stomach hurt pretty bad. it wasnt really violent shaking. I'm quite scared as I know diabetes can be fatal. I also heard about another type of diabetes, I think it's called KDA? I guess its a deficancy of insulin. I have never taken any medication or anything for this. I dont want to tell my mom about this because she thinks when the slightest thing goes wrong with me, I think its something horrible and fatal. I dont feel like I have any anxiety issues or stress...I feel perfectly fine, other than the shaking and all, Which doesn't happen all the time, it's only happened about three times within the last 2 years.Any advice?Thanks.",
