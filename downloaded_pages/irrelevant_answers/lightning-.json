            "answer": "hi, I've experienced this lightning pain, and although I have 3 weeks to wait for my appointment with the neurologist I am certain that this is due to spinal cord compression in the cerivcle spine(neck). I have weakness in my R leg and loss of sensation, I have nerve pain in both arms and have scoliosis(curved spine). I get vertigo(dizziness), headaches which are usually on 1 side or the back of my head and visual disturbances along with forgetfulness too. This lightning pain you speak off I have had this a few times now, and it was Very much like being struck by lightning, then it seemed to radiate into my limbs, which were uncontrollably shaking, I thought I was having a stroke, I rang an ambulance the first time this happened, although I haven't had it that bad since as I would ring another, I just have to wait now for my appointment now. Hope this helps.Beckie",

    "question": "About 8 years ago I was at work when the room started spinning. My nerves were so bad i could not feel my foot so I had to have someone drive me home. I went to the ER twice but was told it was just in my head and would wear off.\u00a0\u00a0I have had two nerve conduction tests and both showed neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0I have hyperasthesia , some pain now in one foot, and just plain weirdness all over. About a year and a half ago the seizures went from unnoticeable to wild! I was having them all the time.\u00a0\u00a0At the hospital, in church, outside.\u00a0\u00a0Strangely I have barely been checked for anything.\u00a0\u00a0I have had 4\u00a0\u00a0neurologists, and still havent ruled out alot of the stuff I see online.\u00a0\u00a0No lumbar, or biopsy, or sleep deprived tests, and I didnt use contrast on my MRI cause I have PKD.\u00a0\u00a0If it would have made that big a difference I would have. I've also had two neuro-psychiatrists. Lyme disease was ruled out and Diabetes has been but that's it.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a neuro who said it cant be this and that but not by use of any test. I feel like someone is shocking my brain or even my spine. I have had very painful seizures where my spine seemed to have electricity running through it.\u00a0\u00a0In the corner of my eye I often see things that arent there or foggy spots.\u00a0\u00a0No bleeding in my brain and no tumor so I am puzzled.\u00a0\u00a0And headaches, etc. mostly on my left side.\u00a0\u00a0It feels like someone hit me in the head with a bat!",
