            "answer": "It'll most likely be at 37 weeks if they see a need at the earliest. Glyburide... I'm wondering why you were prescribed that over insulin. Even my new Ob thought it bad of the old Ob since it's category c and insulin is better and safer overall. And typically enough are taken off it 2 weeks before birth... And I'm now 38 and was 36.5 when it was prescribed.Are your fasting numbers the issue? I found that a slice of gf bread (12g carbs) and peanut butter (1.5 tbsp)helped me have better fasting numbers in the morning. Took a bit to control.Are you doing the gd diet?",

            "answer": "I had gestational diabetes with my kiddo. They kept wanting me to take a pill as well by my nutritionist said I was fine controlling it with diet. so I don't know if we would be in the same boat, but I was scheduled to be induced on my actual due date. In the end I had a csec due to other complications (got stuck at 6cm, kiddo was caught under my rib cage anyways, & apparently I had a super short cord which ended up tangling him, so it was best to do csec. and if I was offered csec again, I'd do it in a heart beat. Next kid will 100% be csec...). But they wouldn't take me any earlier. It's best to wait till your full term if you're ok and baby is ok. But I know at 34 weeks I was done lol but my little man is 18 months and beyond healthy. :-) so keep cooking as long as you can! Good luck!",

            "answer": "Ok. How about exercise? That can help lower your numbers too. I have big lunches, go for a walk, smaller dinners, and my snack before bed, 2 hours after dinner. I'll try to do some exercise but its hard since I eat late dinners and my snack is late too. Leg work in bed since at the end of the day my feet and ankles are swollen. Also, plenty of water before bed (I know, you'll have to get up to pee every so often) and upon waking. Maybe walk a bit when you get up, then test your fasting numbers at least 10 minutes after the walk. Exercise can elevate your numbers slightly when you test, but overall bring them down after that lil rest",
