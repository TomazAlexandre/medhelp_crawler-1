            "answer": "Hi I am 43 and almost 6 months pregnant. So far so good. MY doctor also explained the risk of preterm labor, preeclampsia, high blood pressure, & diabetes...but, I am in very good shape for my age and I am willing to take the risk. So far everything is good with me and the baby. This will be my first child:-) Good luck!",

            "answer": "Hi Annie and Welcome! ;o)I understand that they must explain this information to there 40+ Pregnant Patients, but wish they'd also include that this information is according to \"stats\" and that not all women are affected in the same manner. We really are different, but they always seem to forget that part. ;o)A friend of mine became pregnant at 46...naturally and didn't have ANY problems what so ever. She delivered her healthy babygirl @ 47 naturally...no meds. She and her daughter are healthy as can be. I hope this and other stories encourage you. Yes, there are cases that will be exactly as this doctor explained, but not ALL women experience it, because we aren't all the same. ;o)~Savanha",

            "answer": "I'm still trying and will be 41 in a month. I've heard alot of wonderful stories about women over 40 have perfectly healthy pregnancies both on here and people I've met. There can be complications at any age. At 32 I had gestational diabetes with my DD but still had a normal healthy pregnancy otherwise, it was actually quite a wonderful time. I felt really good. I think they just have to give you those \"warnings\". I wouldn't worry, problems could occur with anyone and that shouldn't keep you from trying! Good luck to you!",
