    "question": "Hi, since a few days a go i've had a close to constant dull buzzing feeling in my right foot. It feels like its coming in waves every few seconds and is freaking me out a little bit as i have Anxiety problems anyway, i'm also just getting over a case of hemorrhoids but i don't think that has anything to do with it.I'm 25/male and live in the UK so it shouldnt be Lymes.",
