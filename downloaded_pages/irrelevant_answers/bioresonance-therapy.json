    "question": "Bioresonance therapy is similar to electromagnetic therapy (EMF), a practice that has gained a lot of attention in the alternative treatments community.\"Practitioners claim that these methods can treat a wide range of ailments, including ulcers, headaches, burns, chronic pain, nerve disorders, spinal cord injuries, diabetes, gum infections, asthma, bronchitis, arthritis, cerebral palsy, heart disease and cancer\"Google \"Dr. Weill bioresonance\" and read what he has to say about it.It may also have some resemblance to Rife treatments, but I don't know if that's true or not.Although some of these treatments are not currently sanctioned by the FDA in the U.S. perhaps further study may allow for them.At least one \"llmd\" Dr. RH recommends the use of Rife.Using pulsed electromagnetic fields probably won't hurt a person but using them INSTEAD OF conventional treatments for a serious illness may.",
