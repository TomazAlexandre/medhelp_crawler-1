            "answer": "You are getting older woman's bodies go through many changes over the yrs.. Blood tests for pregnancy are very accurate.. The fact that you feel sick could just be a mental thing due to not having your period if your mind believes you are pregnant your body will start feeling that way.. Stress can cause a lot of things in your body.. I have experienced the same in the past your body will eventually get back to normal. the test say your not pregnant you need to tell yourself that.. Birth control is not always the way to go it could mess your body up in the long run. If you are sexually active at the moment and don't want a child then it is the way to go.. Your young you will go through a lot of changes.",

            "answer": "Hello,Your symptoms can be due to secondary amenorrhea. Pregnancy is an obvious cause of amenorrhea and is the most common reason for secondary amenorrhea. Further causes are varied and may include conditions that affect the ovaries, uterus, hypothalamus, or pituitary gland. It could be hypothyroidism, post pill amennorhea , polycystic ovarian syndrome or less frequently a pituitary tumor causing high prolactin levels or a hypothalamic disease. Seek a gynaecologist immediately who will take a careful medical history ,a physical examination, including a pelvic examination. Pregnancy test is the first test performed. Blood tests may be ordered to examine the levels of ovarian, pituitary, and thyroid hormones. Imaging studies, such as ultrasound, X-ray, and CT or MRI scanning may also be recommended.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi I am 20 yrs old and have not had my period since Jan. 16 (Today is April 16) so for 3 months I've missed my period.For the last few months I've felt nauseous & dizzy especially in the mornings, I get extremely tired halfway through the day & there have been days when my body felt like it was bruised up.I'm always thirsty & have to pee more ofen than usual. At first I thought I might have diabetes since my dad has diabetes so I went to get checked & the doctor said my blood was fine. Then I got checked for anemia & hypothyroidism but the tests were negative. I've taken 5 urine pregnancy tests from a week since my missed period & a blood test this week that all came back negative. I've gained 8 pounds since this all started. I've never missed a period in my life & it usually always comes around the 16 of every month. What could this be? The doctor said that I should wait one more month & if my period doesn't come I will start bith control to regulate my period. I've read that it could be stress but I've been extremely stressed before & never missed a period. What can it be?I appreciate any help!",
