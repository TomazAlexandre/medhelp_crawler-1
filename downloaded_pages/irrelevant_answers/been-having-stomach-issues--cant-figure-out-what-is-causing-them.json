    "question": "Hi, I am 17 years old, 120 lbs. I have been sick now for about 8 months. I began to become extremely nauseous whenever I ate something, whether it be healthy substance like an apple or Taco Bell. The nausea was so bad I always needed to lay down, however I never threw up. Then came the fatigue. I would get a full 8 hours of sleep in one night and be falling asleep at work the next day. I have also had chronic headaches, reoccurent yeast infections and shortness of breath. My chest feels as if it is tightening and I have horrible heartburn. I have had acid reflux and high cholestrol for a few years (runs in my family). I was prescribed something for the nausea and Nexium for the heartburn. None of this helped. I went to the hospital for an upper GI exam and an ultrasound to check for ulcers or anything abnormal. Results came back clear. As the months went on, the symptoms became worse. Then my mom thought maybe it was diabetes because it also runs in my family and I've been having reoccurent yeast infections. We went for the 4 hours blood glucose test and those results also came back negative. Then I went in for an endoscope at Children's Hospital. The photos came back of my stomach lining and showed that the lining was irritated and looked like alligator skin. They sent a sample off for testing of what they thought was the bacterial infection Helicobacter pylori. Results came back negative. My mom and me are both tired of trying to figure out if there is something wrong with me, we have been to the doctor countless times and end up with no results. Please if you could offer any advice, it would help alot!",
