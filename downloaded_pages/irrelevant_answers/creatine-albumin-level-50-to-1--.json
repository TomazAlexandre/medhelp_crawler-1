            "answer": "Thank you for trying to help me interoret my test, I called consulting nurse and talked to the doctor and he said its a big flucuation but within normal range and nothing to worry about now. He said to bring it up to my doctor the next visit but no cause for concern now. I had to go off my glucophage for diabetes for a couple days and now I can go back on. Thanks again.",

    "question": "Okay, Two days ago I had a Ct scan for something with Contrast so two days later they tested my creatine level, it went from 50 last year down to 1 today-what does that mean? and could it be from the contrast and what does that mean? Please could someone answer soon? It's Friday night with no way to ask my doctor until Monday. Thanks",
