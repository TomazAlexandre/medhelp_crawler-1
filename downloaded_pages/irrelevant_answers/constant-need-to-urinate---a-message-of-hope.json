    "question": "For about 8 weeks since early March, I suffered from a constant feeling that I wanted to urinate, even when I'd just been.\u00a0\u00a0Very discomforting.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor was no help.\u00a0\u00a0I had good days and bad days, but the problem was always there.I found this forum through Google, and saw that many others have had the same trouble, many for extended periods.\u00a0\u00a0The worrying thing was that few seem to say what, if anything, resolved the problem.For me, two weeks ago a kidney stone popped out.\u00a0\u00a0Since then I've been fine.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that's it.I know others will have the same symptoms for many different reasons, and I know how unhappy I was while I had the problem.I just wanted to say that these things do sometimes work themselves out - I hope that holds true for fellow sufferers too, it's a miserable condition.",
