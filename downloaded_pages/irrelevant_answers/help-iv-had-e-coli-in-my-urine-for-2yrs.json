            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Along with antibiotic cover you need to drink plenty of fluids. Holding on to urine, drinking less fluid can also aggravate the infection. Flushing out of bacteria by frequent urination also helps.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest you consult a gastroenterologist and look into the cause of constipation. Most likely it is because you do not eat healthy and drink plenty of fluids. Chronic constipation can be due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc. It can also be due to milk allergy and other food allergies. Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "PLLLEEEAAASSSEEE!!!!!!!! iv had Ecoli in my urine for coming up on 2yrs. No doctor,gynecologist or urologist can figure out why. Iv tried different antibotics. iv been on them for months at a time. which isnt healthy. the ecoli wont go away. I feel its because I hardly\u00a0\u00a0have bowel movements. maybe once a week i have a bowel move. I think the waste has to come out. iv tried everything. enemas dont work, drinking a ton of water, pro biotics, laxatives, been to the emergency room 3 times and they gave me stuff to drink 2 poop. that only made me puke. fiber daily, everything over the counter. Even old wives tales like drinking olive oil, iv tried natural herb remedies. name it, I have tried it. It all makes me worse.\u00a0\u00a0there is nothing no one can do. And\u00a0\u00a0I dont have a bowel blockage. These two problems i feel like are going hand in hand 2gether. It feels like i have a UTI 24-7/365.
