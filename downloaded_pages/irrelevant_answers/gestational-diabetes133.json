            "answer": "Yes, I believe 99 is normal. The best thing to do is eat healthily and walk! I walked around the lobby during my 3 hour with my first daughter and I believe that is why I had q normal result. I walked because I was antsy but later found out walking and other light exercise really helps lower blood sugar levels! Good luck! I had it with my last pregnancy and ended up doing 4 shots a day! Yuck! I'm 70 lbs lighter with this one though so I'm hoping that will help!",

Docs always warned her to watch me. Anyway, I'm just about 38 weeks & to my surprise, my glucose test came back perfect. So thankful & happy the doctors were wrong.",

            "answer": "That's a normal number. Glucose/ sugar is considered to be low when its under 75 and high when it's around 160 an hour or so after you eat. 99 it's normal. My dad is diabetis and so his parents, 3 sisters and 3 brothers. My dad has to take both insulin and medicines. My OB told me to keep having a balance diet and exercising and I will be fine but my regular doctor told me that I will probably or probably not be diabetic until I get on my late 30`s just like my dad since it's a family history thing.",

    "question": "My chances of developing diabetes are high, both my parents have diabetes, I got tested at 10 weeks and got normal results, at 16 weeks I got another test (due to having glucose on my urine) and my one hr came back slightly elevated 156/140 and had to do the 3 hr and got normal results! Today I eat at 9 am, I had a sprite with my meal, and I decided to check my blood sugar with my mom's machine, and to my surprise my reading came 99 after 3 hrs, it is a normal number right?? I'm 27 weeks 3 days!",
