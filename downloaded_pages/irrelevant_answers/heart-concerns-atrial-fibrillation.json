            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The basis of therapy of AF are treating the underlying heart disease, restoring the rhythm, maintaining the rhythm and anticoagulation to prevent complication. For restoring the rhythm medications like Flecanide are used. Without rhythm control, the main complication is increased ventricular rate. Also, exercise tolerance is better with rhythm control. So, based on your present clinical symptoms and AF status, therapy can be planned. So, please don't worry and discuss the possibilities with your consulting doctor.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I am obese and have sleep apnea, well controlled HBP, moderately well controlled diabetes type II.\u00a0\u00a0Just diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, will be having holter monitor and stress echocardiogram next week. Have had heart palpitations since my late 20s, drs considered them harmless, and they almost disappeared when I started BP meds. Noticed occasional fluttering in my chest past 2-3 yrs, getting more frequent past few months, and now notice mild discomfort with them occasionally in the middle of my chest~ not exactly pain, but twinges and brief discomfort lasting only a few seconds, but increasing infrequency the past few weeks.",
