            "answer": "Dear Rubydoo,Thank you for contacting the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. I apologize for the delay in answering. We have had several volunteers out of town, more than normal. I thank you for your patience.None of us here are physicians, but volunteers and are unable to give you medical advice. I can share with you my own experience as a mother with a son who has had type 1 for 15 years. I have to say that my heart goes out to you with all that you are dealing with. Diabetes is hard enough to manage\u00a0\u00a0without everything that you are going through.I am going to assume that you have spoken to your doctor about the change in your insulin and if this is a possible cause of some of your symptoms. You may want to revisit this with him/her. I am also wondering about all of the meds that you need to take. There can be side effects with some of them that maybe affecting your diabetes. Are your different doctors communicating and sending reports to the doctor who you see for your diabetes? This can be vital.There are many possible reasons that you are experiencing the nausea, fatigue and losing weight. You may want to ask your physician about celiac or gastroparesis. Both are different complications or diseases, but involve the way the stomach responds to food. There are treatments for both. I only say this because my son has gastroparesis and your symptoms are familar. Believe me,it could be something completely different. Again, these are just suggestions to speak to your doctor about.There will be more comments from others. I apoligize again for the delay. Please keep in contact and let us know how you are doing. I do understand how frustrating it can be to not know what is going on.Best wish's to you and keep in touch,dm",

            "answer": "Some of the things you are mentioning make me want to suggest other things to look at. I happen to be a type 1 diabetic who takes Lantus and Humalog. My identical twin sister had some allergic types of reactions to certain medications which seem to include fatique. So a possible reaction to the new insulins could be something to look at. This could be checked out easily enough by going back to the previous insulins and seeing if you felt better. Easy enough to figure out by trial and error.I do know that some diabetics complain of spasms in the chest when hypoglycemic, so you may want to watch for a pattern to see if hypoglycemic episodes coincide at all with the chest discomfort.The hypoglycemic unawareness problem can be alleviated by lowering the insulin doses (or in your case, since you have lost weight, raising your calories and carb intake) just enough to prevent the hypos for a period of about 2 weeks. At that time, tests have shown that most people can regain their early warning symptoms of hypos. This has worked for me and I have gone from having no warnings at all of severe hypoglycemia to being able to feel it when my glucose is at about 70, so I can attest to the fact that this works.Also, the fact that you have had some surgeries and other medical issues recently could be a factor. My sister has two horses and is injured a lot, actually, dealing with these large animals. After an injury or a surgery, she always complains of unbelievable fatigue. Her doctors have suggested that the fatigue may be her body's way of slowing her normally almost ultra-active lifestyle down so her body can put some of its energies into healing.The weight loss and insomnia could have roots in other health issues. Hormonal changes in the late 40's could easily explain the insomnia, which is pretty common in premenopausal women, and you might want to consider having your doctor check out your thyroid function as far as the weight loss issue is concerned. Many diabetics find that they have abnormal thyroid functions, and this is something that is worth checking out, for weight loss could easily be thyroid-related.Those are just some thoughts based on my sister's health issues and complaints of similar symptoms at times. Hope they give you some food for thought.",

    "question": "I am a 40 year old female IDDM for 19 years. For the last 5 months I have been not well. In February I switched from Humalog and Humulin N to Novarapid and Novulin N 5 needles a day and seemed to have had problems since. Several unresponsive lows, then highs, then regulated. Then I started to lose weight, insomnia, night sweats,nausea, fatigue, unable to feel symptoms of low or high blood sugar (walking around with 1.9 mmol/l)I also had alot of dental work done (3 surgeries) in that time frame. Thyroid tests normal, HgA1C 6.9, blood work only showed low iron stores. Then began to have chest pain. Endocrinologist sent me for echo and EKG and found problems (which I will post on cardiac forum)but no one is able to find what is causing these problems. I am also booked for a colonoscopy which was delayed because of the heart problems. (myxomatous mitral valve disease and mild septal and inferior wall hypokineis) I also have HBP and am on Altace and now on Monocor. I also take diazepam and codeine for past 3 hip surgeries. 5' 8\" 127 pounds and active.Any suggestions that no one else has thought of? I am sick and tired of being sick and tired!",
