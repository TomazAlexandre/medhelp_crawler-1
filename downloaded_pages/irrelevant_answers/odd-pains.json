            "answer": "JainMD,Thanks for your quick reply.Are those all tests that I should have run by my Dr.? Rheumetologist or neurologist?\u00a0\u00a0Is neuropathy treatable?About the mono, the hematologist/oncologist ran a bunch of blood test and it just showed Epstein barr virus which usually causes mononucleosis.",

            "answer": "Hi,These tests are done to check out for any disease which might be prevalent. These can be ordered by your physician too.Yes there are numerous causes of neuropathy which are treatable.I am not sure what test they have done for mono, but if it is regarding EBV titers then it must be IgG titers what they would have done.Keep me informed if you have any queries.Bye.",

            "answer": "I'm thinking some of these test should have been ran already considering I've been to 2 GP's an oncologist and hematologist and given TONS of blood, but who knows.Is neuropathy something I should be really worried about? What types of alternative treatment is there? ex. acupuncture, craniosacral work, herbs? Does it ever go away on its own? Could EBV be the culprit?Sorry for all the questions!! I've never heard of neuropathy.Thanks again.",

    "question": "About 6 mos ago I felt ill one night(headache,tired,dizzy) and later had a bowl movement that had serious cramping along with it. It went away but, the next week I just had a little cramping so I went to the doctor. I was about to start trying to concieve so I was all worried. I can worry about anything. Anyway, GP says infection or diverticulitis and I have to go get a barium enima. In the mean time she gives me some antobiotics if it is infection.After that I started having random fleeting pains around my body that last about a sec or two, then move somewhere else. It got me so worked up I had my first panic attack. After some meds I have the anxiety attacks under control, but my pains are still there. Psych says it's anxiety, but I believe I have something else, which the psych says anxiety will make you think.I've had all kinds of testing, and the only thing that shows up is that I have mono.\u00a0\u00a0But can mono do this for 6 mos??? Just another though...5 mos before this I quit taking my bc and zoloft so I could get preg.Any ideas of what's going on? I'm so stressed about this and it's all I can think about.",
