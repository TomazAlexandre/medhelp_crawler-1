    "question": "My son's pediatrician called me yesterday to let me know that bloodwork done before Christmas showed that his TSH was up to 11 (it was been normal back in October or November).\u00a0\u00a0The labs were done because his weight gain since he was about 9-10 months has been very poor.\u00a0\u00a0He will gain a little bit and then plateau and then gain a little bit and then plateau.\u00a0\u00a0He has only gained approx. 2 pounds since he was 10 months old (that's in 8 months).\u00a0\u00a0He's only 20# and given his birth weight of 9# he should have reached 20# long ago.I did some research on the internet and while I found that hypothyroidism in infants can cause poor appetite and spotty growth I don't see that he has any of the other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0He's *extremely* active (we often joke that if he'd sit down more he might gain a little weight), he does have dry skin but not bad, no brittle hair, no yellowing of the skin, etc.\u00a0\u00a0We're going today for a repeat tsh plus t3, t4, etc. He's already being followed by cardiology (for a bout of Kawasaki Disease over Thanksgiving).\u00a0\u00a0He saw endo last fall to rule out a growth disorder and he's currently being worked up by gi for his weight problem (they're the ones who reordered the tsh).\u00a0\u00a0I had really thought that we'd be done with specialists for him this month.\u00a0\u00a0*sigh*\u00a0\u00a0I still have hope that 2007 will be better for my family health-wise but this is not a promising start.\u00a0\u00a0Should I be worried at all about this elevated tsh?\u00a0\u00a0I know he's at higher risk because of my thyroid problems.\u00a0\u00a0If he is hypo should I get my daughter checked, too?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
