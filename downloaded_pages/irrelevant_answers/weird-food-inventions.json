    "question": "Has anyone had weird cravings or invented new meals during pregnancy ? 37 weeks along and made boxed Mac and cheese at 3 am with hot pepper flakes, hot sauce, shredded Colby jack cheese\u00a0\u00a0and crumbed crackers on top. I was tempted to throw it in the oven but I just couldn't wait to dive in. (I know it's probably not the healthiest but mama just couldn't help it this time) what are some out of the ordinary craving combinations you ladies have experienced so far?",
