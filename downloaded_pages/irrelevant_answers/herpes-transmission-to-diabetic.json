You starting suppressive therapy makes it even lower yet. throw in condoms too and the risk is on average 1% of transmitting the virus to a male partner.There aren't any higher risks because he has diabetes either.grace",

If not, he should be.As long as you two are together, unless he gets obvious and painful lesions in the genital area he shouldn't really be too concerned. should the relationship not work out though after you've been intimate, he should be sure to repeat his herpes blood test 4 months after the last time you had sex together. Otherwise no symptoms, no reason for testing as long as you are together unless he just wants tested yearly or even less often just out of curiosity.that make sense?grace",

The abdominal pain starts when you start the medication, it doesn't occur a few weeks into it.grace",
