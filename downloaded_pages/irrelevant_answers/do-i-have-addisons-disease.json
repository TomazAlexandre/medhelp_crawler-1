I would find out if you have more than one issue or if this is going to be progressive - and if this is related to the birth of your child. I would also find another doctor - why not be treated! That is silly.",

            "answer": "I would get a copy of the testing. I would then take the testing and go to another doctor. It is not normal to just go straight to a stim test - the stim is the last test, not the first... normally one does all the base testing and see if there are other disorders first.Sure, thyroid can cause a lot of issues - but so can low vitamin D, low\u00a0\u00a0iron, low sodium, low etc etc etc - so without knowing what you got tested and what you are dealing with - SILLY...\u00a0\u00a0You are entitled to a copy of the exact testing.",

    "question": "Hi I am 29 and have had type 1 diabetes for 26years. Since the birth of my daughter 11months ago I have been feeling nausea and really tired my blood tests show I have hypothyroidism but my endocrinologist is reluctant to treat me yet as my test started showing some improvement so he is hoping they improve more on their own even though they haven't in a year. he has recently tested me for Addison's disease which came back as equivocal. I had a synacthen test and for the baseline test my cortisol levels were healthy and normal but after having the ACTH injection my results remained blunted and didn't change much does this mean I have addison's disease.",
