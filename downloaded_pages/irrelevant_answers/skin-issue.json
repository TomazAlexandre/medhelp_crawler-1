            "answer": "Hi!Please do not use a needle to break the blisters/pimples. Blisters can be caused by intense rubbing or friction. They can also be seen in moist skin as one always covered with sweat or water. Blisters can also be a part of contact dermatitis like contact with soap, detergents, powder etc. Pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid are the other conditions that should be ruled out. Other possibilities are diabetes, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, atopic dermatitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, chronic bullous dermatosis, and malnutrition.All the above mentioned conditions can also cause peeling of skin on the palm. It is difficult to diagnose this on net. Please consult a skin specialist. Take care!",
