If the above links get blocked, I Google searched under \"new born diabetes\", \"pregnancy and diabetes\" and \"diabetes care during pregnancy\". And, lastly, the JAMA (The Journal of the American Medical Association) web site. You can search here for your thrush issues.",

            "answer": "Thank you Waverider!Great links.Also explains why my endo is ok with my BS at the moment with no meds, but told me that he will put me on insulin again when I'm trying to get pregnant again late this year (my first pregnancy I was diagnoses with diabetes at about 6 weeks pregnant - which means it was probably preexisting and was on insulin from about 12 weeks on)....Though of course, it would seem that lower would be better anyway (if it's risk to pregnancy I imagine it's probably a risk for other things, even if less than overt diabetes..",

    "question": "Hi,Does anyone know why they apply more stringent standards for diabetes during pregnancy than they do outside pregnancy?\u00a0\u00a0Is it 'cuase the baby is more sensitive, or just becuase they don't think it's worth being so strict when people aren't pregnant.Ok, when i was pregnant fbs levels greater than 95 warranted an adjustment in insulin and we were keeping FBS around 80.\u00a0\u00a0Now that I've had the baby, FBS of 95 - 105 is considered fine.\u00a0\u00a0(I did ok on my OGTT - it's just my fasting blood sugar levels that are perhaps borderline).I'm on no meds now.\u00a0\u00a0But having a really bad case of thrush of breasts and down there that doesn't seem to be responding to standard treatment with diflucan.\u00a0\u00a0Am wondering if the high normal blood sugars over night could be contributing...Any ideas....",
