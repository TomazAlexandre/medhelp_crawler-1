            "answer": "abeybaby,I am not a doctor so don't take my opinions as the absolute truth.\u00a0\u00a0For that you have to go to a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0A normal blood sugar is around 90.\u00a0\u00a0Most of us wait around 2 hours after a meal before testing.\u00a0\u00a0For a diabetic, 145 would be OK after 1 1/2 hours.\u00a0\u00a0It would be interesting to know what yours was after 2 hours. it may just take your body a little longer to process the sugar.\u00a0\u00a0However, your fasting blood sugars look good to me.I understand that with your family history, you might naturally be a little anxious about getting diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Testing your blood sugar occasionally is a good way to reassure yourself that your blood sugar is normal.\u00a0\u00a0However, testing won't prevent Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Type I Diabetes is not something that you can prevent.\u00a0\u00a0It is also not caused by being 10 pounds overweight.\u00a0\u00a0Significant obesity can cause Type II Diabetes and certainly can aggravate Type I.\u00a0\u00a0Losing 10 pounds can't hurt and is good for a lot of reasons, but it won't necessarily affect your blood sugars. Exercise can help lower your blood sugar so the process of losing weight might help.From a personal perspective, I would enjoy your good health now, keep up your healthy eating habits, test your blood sugars occasionally (but don't make yourself crazy), take care of your body and soul, because those are good things to do anyway.\u00a0\u00a0And if you do get diabetes someday, get as much support as you can and know that you already have great habits and will be able to maintain your health. I know it's worrisome, but there really isn't a whole lot more that you can do than what you're doing.Es",

            "answer": "I think so, but I'm not a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0If you're worried, I would recommend a consult with an endocrinologist. He/She will be able to give you more info on what you should expect blood sugar wise and also the genetic connection.\u00a0\u00a0He may also be able to set your mind at ease and that is the most important thing.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.ES",

    "question": "I am knew at this so please bear with me I am trying to determine where I fit in the non to pre diabetic status at the moment. I have two parents who got diagnosed with type 2 at ages 50 and 55 so I am cautious about my own state at age 39.My question: I ate what would be considered a bowl and a half of oatmeal with skim milk about 1 1/2 hrs ago and took my glucose and found it to be at 145 ... is this a normal read for 1 1/2 hrs later ? Should I try again in 30 min and see what the reading is?Also, I am about 8-9 lbs overweight for my size. I am almost 5 9 \" and weigh in at 175 lbs and the doctor said loose 10 lbs. Also all my fat is on my stomach area.\u00a0\u00a0By loosing this will this help my blood glucose levels ?The doctor is saying that because both my parents are diabetic I need to be vigilant right now to prevent or prolong me getting it.\u00a0\u00a0My current glucose fasting readings are as follows:85909010611685Not in any particular order - these are it over a few weeks normally taken in the morning or after a 1--12 hr fast.More interesting in knowing about the results after 1 1/2 hours of eating ...Many thanks-",
