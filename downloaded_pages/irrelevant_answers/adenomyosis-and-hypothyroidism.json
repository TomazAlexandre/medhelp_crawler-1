            "answer": "Thank you for the feedback. I'm gathering as much info. as possible.Yes, it's a hormonal feeling with me as well. Adenomyosis is similar to Endometriosis, but it affects the muscle of the uterus and I think it is part of my problem. Still going from one dr. to the next. I'll ask about your situation on my next visit. Thanks again...",

    "question": "I have had Adenomyosis for over 10 yrs, and symptoms have been getting worse, I am 45 with no diabetes or HT. Over the past 4 months I have been having a large amt. of unexplained symptoms, mainly during menses. I have seen many specialists for diagnosed parasites, IBS, ISVD, Strabismus(no cause found), RT factor, and unexplained incidences such as panic disorder and cold intolerability. Recently, had an event that was similar to a miscarriage, but testing showed otherwise. I have seen an endocrin., but because I was having symptoms of both hypo and hyper at the time, since blood tests came back 'normal', he went textbook on me. I will be seeing another endocrin. and IM within the next month as they are highly recommended, and just had a endom. biopsy done. Any suggestions would be much appreciated. I am at the end of the line here!",
