            "answer": "I also have Hashimoto's. I am TTC as well. I found out I was pregnant in March but miscarried. The good news is it wasn't because of my Thyroid. You do need to go on medication to regulate it though. Unregulated Thyroid problems will cause infertility and miscarriage. You need to get on some meds to help regulate it and then you should be able to carry a child. Good luck to you.",

I am on Synthroid 75mcg, I do not have PCOS, nor endomatriosis or enything, I do have another vaginal US on monday so we'll see but the US showed nothing before, and I don't have any PCOS sympthoms either.

    "question": "Hello, me and my husband have been trying to conceive for 2 years.\u00a0\u00a0we have been checked and we have absolutely nothing worng with us. Last week I was tld I had Hashimoto's and my anti TPO abs were really high >1300IU/ml. I've read in this website, and others, that that can cause infertility, or implantation failure. I am scared since I just want to be able to carry my own baby and it seem at this point that it might be impossible. Please, please I ask that you give me all the feedback possible becasue right now the research I've done tells me that I might never be able to have kids.thank you in advance.",
