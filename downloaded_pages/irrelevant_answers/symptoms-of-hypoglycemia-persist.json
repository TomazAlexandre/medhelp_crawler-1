            "answer": "Yes you can.\u00a0\u00a0By definition, hypoglycemia is the opposite of diabetes or hyperglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0Both are problems associated with blood-sugar management.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone gets low blood sugar at some point in their lives, but for people like me, it drops too low and can cause much more severe problems.\u00a0\u00a0Hypoglycemia is often referred to as a temporary condition whereas a person is hypoglycemic and has low blood-sugar at present.I have been all but diagnosed with hypoglycemia but no doctor has been able to pinpoint a cause.\u00a0\u00a0I remember getting lightheaded as a kid when I went a long while without food and had my first real scare as a teen when I went blind for a few seconds.\u00a0\u00a0I felt better after I ate triscuits, and my family assumed I was hypoglycemic.\u00a0\u00a0I had a very poor diet when I was 21 and actually had a grand mal seizure at college.\u00a0\u00a0My blood sugar was below 60 (40 something I think) when they brought me in the hospital so the doctors assumed I was hypoglycemic.\u00a0\u00a0I had CT, MRI, EEG, EKG, etc done with no definitive result.\u00a0\u00a0The last test was a blood-sugar tolerance test which actually gave me a seizure!\u00a0\u00a0They put my blood-sugar up so high that when it swung down, there was nothing I could do but sit in terror as my vision blurred, my hands quaked, and everything went black.\u00a0\u00a0I was tested years later for a tumor on my pancreas which could affect my insulin production but the test was negative.The whole time, I heard doctors telling me all kinds of guesses and ways to manage it.\u00a0\u00a0None of them knew for sure but offered plenty of info.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that hypoglycemia would eventually become diabetes; the worse my diet the quicker.\u00a0\u00a0There are support/info groups online with thousands of people living with hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0Most doctors said that low blood-sugar could not cause seizures no matter what my tests said.\u00a0\u00a0This just goes to show how little doctors typically know about it.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, I can only offer what has been working for me in the few years since a seizure...I eat a small to medium sized high-protein, low fat/sugar meal every 2-3 hours.\u00a0\u00a0I don't drink anymore.\u00a0\u00a0I limit my intake of high-fructose corn syrup and keep things like sodas around as a backup.\u00a0\u00a0I keep sugar packets and granola bars in my pockets at all times in case.\u00a0\u00a0I plan my outings and work around meals.\u00a0\u00a0It does interfere with my life\u00a0\u00a0sometimes and I often don't feel normal around groups of people, but I'd do about anything to not feel my blood sugar drop like it has before.\u00a0\u00a0It is manageable and I do have a real life today.\u00a0\u00a0I hope I have offered some help and at very least, knowledge that you are not alone.Peace",
