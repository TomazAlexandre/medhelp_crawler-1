Im in New Zealand and the info pamphlet i've got says 39 weeks for safety reasons which covers big babies etc. Enquire with your midwife i just think thats too late to be honest but i don't know how other countries operate but here its bang on 39 weeks if it's scheduled.",

            "answer": "Some drs like to wait a bit past 39 weeks to allow for due date error. The scans can be wrong too especially later In pregnancy. Talk to your dr about any concerns that you have and if you don't agree with what your doctor says maybe ask if they can justify their reasoning. Good luck",

    "question": "OK so this is my 3rd pregnancy, i am 38 weeks , baby has been measuring big since my anatomy scan at 20 weeks. I have been going weekly since 28 weeks because of bp, Gestational diabetes, and too much amniotic fluid. Now today doc told me that baby is just too large for me to deliver. And scheduled c- section for OCT. 29. @ 730am. :-/ I'm sad and scared my others were both natural births but both were under 8lbs this baby is already measuring 10 lbs. :-(",
