            "answer": "Hi,An abscess is usually lanced and drained. But if the infection keeps coming back after incision and drainage, a wide excision of the infected area may help. Has your doctor done that and made a culture of the infecting organism? If not, it should be done so that a proper antibiotic treatment can be focused on the offending organism.It is also possible that your infection keeps coming back because you have some other illness which could affect your immune system such as diabetes.Since these infections are sometimes very difficult to treat, I would advise you to consult with a Breast Specialist to obtain better care regarding these recurring abscesses in your breast.Best wishes.P.S. I doubt very much that you\u2019ll get a response from \u201cszy\u201d since her thread is very old and she is probably no longer active in this Community Forum.",
