            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Progressive weakness with legs being afflicted before arms and upper body can be due to Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) or chronic relapsing polyneuropathy. The symptoms of CIDP are also seen in multiple sclerosis (MS) and autoimmune neuropathy. Hence, these two conditions should be ruled out.Other possibilities are diabetes, hypothyroidism, lupus, myasthenia gravis. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hello I have been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy and was wondering if when I walk my legs seem to feel so heavy...I am now noticing that same heaviness in my upper body, the smallest task like showering totally exhausts me... I feel like I'm getting weaker in addition to all the other agonizing symptoms. Is progressive weakness a part of peripheral neuropathy???",
