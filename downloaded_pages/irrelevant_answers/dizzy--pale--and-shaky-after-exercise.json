            "answer": "Your symptoms could be either high OR low glucose. I would also recommend that you ask to have simple blood tests done to show what your current glucose levels are. You may also want to ask for a glucose tolerance test to see if your body is reacting to stimulus by dropping your glucose levels too low (the fact that you feel better after drinking gatorade seems to indicate that you may be hypo at times). You don't need to live feeling this way... either hypoglycemia or diabetes are both treatable, but you need to know if either of these are part of the problem. Good luck to you.",

    "question": "I am not sure what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0I am an experienced athlete who runs in college.\u00a0\u00a0I have had to be pulled because of issues with my foot.\u00a0\u00a0Within the past week, I have been biking and have needed to be pulled off the machine every day after only 20-30 minutes (this is not long for me at all, I am usually able to run for close to 80 minutes with higher intensity and have felt fine).\u00a0\u00a0I become very pale, am told by the trainers that my eyes look really glazed, and feel very dizzy.\u00a0\u00a0I lie down and rest for a while and take some gateroade and wiat until I feel normal again and then am allowed to leave.Even throughout the day lastely though, I have become increasingly hungry.\u00a0\u00a0I feel I am eating the most ever (they check my weight periodically and I guess I lost 3-4 pounds in a month).\u00a0\u00a0I threw up one day when I felt particularly bad.\u00a0\u00a0My hand will soemtimes shake throughout the day, but its only my right hand not my left.Two days before I had my period I was urinating probably every 30 minutes to an hour. The urine was light and clear.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure if this was just around my menstrual cycle and right now I have it so it's hard to judge if its abnormalI don't understand what the onset of this is.\u00a0\u00a0I know that hypoglycemia and diabetes runs in my family.\u00a0\u00a0I just started college and was told by the nutrionist that my diet is too carbo loaded and so I am trying to go away from them and lean more to the protein.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, I have asthma and they uped my dose of the medication but then lowered it when it wasn't improving my asthma.Has anyone experienced anything like this",
