            "answer": "Ashley,I dont mean to be nosey or blunt,but are you a heavier person? especially around your abdomen area? I only ask because I myself am overweight,especially in my abdomen area and I have irregular periods,always have, and I have a condition call PCOS(polycystic ovarian syndrome) Another scary side effect that goes hand in hand with PCOS is insulin resistance which can lead to type 2 diabetes which I also just found I have. The major symptoms of diabetes is an abnormal unquenchable thirst,headaches,headaches and being very tired. My doctor told me that many people with Diabetes feel like they have mono because of how tired and drained they feel. The most telling sypmtom is the water drinking. I think you really should go to a clinic or find some way to get into a doctors office to get checked out. please feel free to contact me about this if you want.",
