            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The commonest cause for proteinuria is an urinary tract infection. Have a culture and sensitivity test done to find out the correct antibiotic that the infecting organism is sensitive to and taking this medication for the required amount of days may help to clear urinary tract infection. It could also be due to diabetes. The cyst may need further evaluation. Discuss these options with your consulting doctor.He may do tests like urine analysis, blood tests, X rays, ultrasonography, CT scan and sometimes cystoscopy to detect the cause for proteinuria.",
