    "question": "Hello - I have a daughter who's had T1\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes for 17 years, so I've\u00a0\u00a0tested abt once a month since then, either fasting or post meal. I had surgery for breast cancer on 8/22/07. My blood panel was done just before I went in; blood sugar was 79. My post surgery blood sugars have been up. For instance; fasting a.m. is around 90; then I walk/run for 40 minutes and I'm around 70. I'll have a complex CHO like 1/2 c oatmeal with 1/4 c fruit after which my sugar can go to 150 or higher. If I run for another 40 minutes i can get it down to 85. This is during recovery..when I go back to work it won't be possible.I think I'm devloping T2. BTW; I was on keflex and vicodin/tylenol meds for 10+ days post surgery.I am now on an aromotase inhibitor, which depletes my body of estrogen, since the tumor was ER positive. any feedback / ideas?",
