            "answer": "Obviously, this information is nothing to be laughed at. Rather than discuss sugary food affecting your periods, you might ask your doctor to check you for menopause because of your symptoms. You might also mention that eating sugary food also affects your body and you would like to be checked for diabetes or any other testing he/she might suggest. The bleeding could also be due to a polyp or buildup of the uterine lining and the bleeding with sugary food is just a coincidence. An ultrasound of the uterus and ovaries might be helpful to see if that is the case.Machelle M. Seibel, MD",
