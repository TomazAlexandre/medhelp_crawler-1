            "answer": "Hi there!\u2018Osteoarthritic changes of the lumber vertebrae\u2019 refers to degenerative arthritis of the lower spine, with narrowing of the lower few intervertebral disc spaces; as the cartilage which cushions the bones in the spine (vertebrae), as they move against each other, becomes progressively degraded and damaged. \u2018Line of weight bearing falling anterior to the sacral promontory\u2019 would indicate an abnormal spinal curvature which could be the cause or the result of osteoarthritis. Some degree of osteoarthritis is expected with age which can worsen post-menopause, being overweight, improper posture, lack of physical exercise/ muscle strength, chronic trauma, diabetes etc., which causes degeneration of the joint and associated inflammation that causes pain. The acute injury is unlikely to be related to it. It is not a completely treatable condition, though it can be partially managed. Management may include bed rest, pain and anti-inflammatory medication, weight loss, physiotherapy and muscle strengthening exercises etc.; or interventional or surgical procedures in severe cases. You may like to discuss these in detail with her doctor.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "My mom slipped and fell sitting on a cemented floor five days ago. She couldn\u2019t stand nor sit. But she can move her legs. She was taken to the hospital and her x-ray was taken. It took a long time before we get the results and according to it:Osteoarthritic changes are noted in the margin of the lumbar vertebrate with narrowing of L1, L2 and L5 to sacral 1 disc spaces. Line of weight bearing falls anterior to the sacral promontory.I hope you can enlighten me on this. What does the this mean, please? Thank you very much.",
