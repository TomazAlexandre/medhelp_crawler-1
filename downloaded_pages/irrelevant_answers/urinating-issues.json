            "answer": "It sounds like a Urinary Track Infection. You'd better give a sample of urine to get tested and then go to your doctor to prescribe you antibiotics.In the meanwhile, drink TONS of water and cranberry juice (these help flush the virouses away and naturally disinfect your urinary system) and keep the area clean!",

            "answer": "Hello,These symptoms can be due to urinary tract infection or interstitial cystitis. The cause of most UTIs is bacteria that initially settle (colonise) around the urethra (urine tube), and then ascend into the rest of the urinary tract. Factors that can cause this to happen include incomplete urinary emptying, hygiene of the urethra, prostate inflammation, urethra narrowing, bladder reflux disease (usually due to leaky valves between the bladder and ureter tubes that connect to the kidneys and diabetes etc.Hence it is better to get a urine examination and urine culture done.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
