            "answer": "Try and relax, the more upright and stressed you are the more your hormone balance is out of wack to go into labour naturally. So enjoy yourself, relax, treat yourself to nice food and pampering things. And have sex if you feel up for it. Sperm is the only proven thing to help labour start as the hormones in the sperm work on the cervix",

    "question": "So had my 38 week check today and was hoping to get a sweep to get things moving (had a very difficult birth first time) ended up having to fight with my doc and having a bit of a meltdown just to convince them to try only to be told my cervix is too high, too posterior and too closed to be able to do it, so have to back next week to try again. To say I'm gutted is an understatement I'm already really anxious of things going badly wrong again the closer to term I get plus I have spd which is getting worse by the day! Anyone else had an unsuccessful sweep only to go into labour naturally shortly after?",
