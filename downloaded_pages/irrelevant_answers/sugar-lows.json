            "answer": "Hypoglycemia is controlled via the diet, not via medications.\u00a0\u00a0You need to set up a diet similiar to that of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Eating a lot of sugar isn't the answer, but rather eat a combination of starches and complex carbs to balance the sugar requirements you need to have energy throughout the day.\u00a0\u00a0Taking glucose tablets would be only in the event that you crash.\u00a0\u00a0Eating simple sugars like candy peak your sugar in a short time and then you crash because it can't sustain glucose in the blood.\u00a0\u00a0It is important to eat a variety of foods from all food groups, but the combinations should be correct for you.\u00a0\u00a0You can buy many books on this topic, or you can see a nutritionist for diet suggestions.\u00a0\u00a0There is also a forum here on this site with a nutritionist who might be able to make some suggestions.\u00a0\u00a0good luck",

            "answer": "I've suffered from the same for a long time and yes, a lot of doctors (especially in uk) do not prescribe anything for it.\u00a0\u00a0I even have to buy the test strips for my glucose meter to keep a regular check on my blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I have found, after trial and error that eating 'natural foods' really helps regulate my blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor did put me on the GI diet but that really made the problem a lot worse - it's simply not suited to everyone.\u00a0\u00a0So now I only eat fresh meat, organic vegetables/fruit, probiotic drinking yoghurts and if I want cakes then it's home made - I tried using fructrose as a substitute for sugar but I can say I'd rather go without - obviously it's personal taste.\u00a0\u00a0An instant oat porridge with honey is a really good at setting you up for the day or late at night as it helps to keep your blood sugar stable for quite a number of hours.\u00a0\u00a0Plus you must remember to have breakfast! - one of my big downfalls until I finally got into the habit of doing myself breakfast when I did it for the kids - I have learnt it's far better to regulate your blood sugar through your diet naturally rather than use an 'artificial substance' like glucagon and over time your blood sugar drops will not appear as often - my last drop was about three/four weeks ago because of a can of coke (but I couldn't resist temptation!).",
