            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The numbness and tingling in the arm after getting up from sleep can be due to bad posture, nerve compression, deep vein thrombosis or sleep disorder. Change your posture, move about the arm, gently massage it and see if it helps. It can also be a peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes and thyroid disorders. The best thing would be to consult a general practitioner or PCP and try and assess what is the cause of your problem. Nerve conduction studies, MRI of cervical spine, dopplar studies, sleep studies etc may be required for diagnosis. Then proper referral for concerned specialist can take things further and get you proper treatment. Take care!",
