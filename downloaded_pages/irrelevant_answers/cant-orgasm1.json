            "answer": "Hello,It is true that loss of libido is very commonly found in women and mostly the cause is psychological in nature. It can be due to stress and anxiety or relationship problems with your partner. Talk to your husband for the psychological support. If you are having any stress, then this psychological support will help. A healthy affectionate communication with the partner helps in decreasing anxiety and stress.However if there is no stress and anxiety then the physical causes need to be ruled out. These include anemia, diabetes and hormonal imbalance. Some investigations which need to be done( some may have been done in the hormonal studies) are follicle stimulating hormone levels, estradiol, thyroxine and thyrotrophin levels in the blood test reports.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Thank you, Dr., but my problem is not psychological. I have normal libido and I get very wet when I'm excited, I just can't orgasm when I'm being stimulated in my clitoris. I have more sensation in my vagina. Could it be that the \"hood\" over my clitoris should be totally removed? I had surgery to get the hood removed 3 yrs ago,but the surgeon left it partially covered. Wish he would've removed it all, and who knows, if that might've helped. Another question, does one have to release liquid upon orgasm or is there such a thing as a dry orgasm?",

    "question": "I am sexually frustrated because I can't seem to orgasm.\u00a0\u00a0It's only happened a couple of times in my life when a boyfriend did oral sex on me when I was asleep. That woke me up! It was great but that onky happened many years ago. I had a partial removal of the clitoral hood a couple of years ago. The doctor preferred to leave it partially covered to my disappointment, Should I get it all removed to facilitate orgasm?\u00a0\u00a0What can help me?",
