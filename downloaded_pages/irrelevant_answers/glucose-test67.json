I told my Dr that I refuse and if she thinks I have diabetes then move forward with her recommendations.\u00a0\u00a0I live 1 hr from the Dr office. They usually make me wait one hr to be seen. Then they do the 3 hr test and poke me over ten times because they cannot find a vein. Then another 1 hr drive home. Too long for me. I get sickness a lot when I do not eat.",
