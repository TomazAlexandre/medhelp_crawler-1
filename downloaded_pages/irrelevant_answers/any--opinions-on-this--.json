            "answer": "Hello and welcome!\u00a0\u00a0For one, the figures you gave are not consistent for a glucose level.\u00a0\u00a0For example, a normal glucose fasting level may be 70, whereas a postprandial glucose level (after eating), may be 120.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps\u00a0\u00a0you meant to post the #'s without the decimal point?\u00a0\u00a0That would make more sense.Have you been diagnosed with pre-diabetes, or diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Who instructed you to check your blood glucose and what were the instructions?\u00a0\u00a0There are good reasons why your sugar is to be checked at certain times during the day.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise, the values can be taken out of context.\u00a0\u00a0Sounds like you took it upon yourself to get the meter.\u00a0\u00a0Only your doctor should be advising you to check your sugar at home.\u00a0\u00a0People can easily go overboard thinking they need to be checking it at home all the time.\u00a0\u00a0Not everyone needs to be doing that...certainly not if they don't understand how a glucose level will fluctuate.\u00a0\u00a0You need to discuss home monitoring with your doctor, and ask for specific instructions.\u00a0\u00a0IF the doc wants you to be checking it at home, he will tell you how and when to do so, and give you a journal to log your results.\u00a0\u00a0Also, whose idea were the glucose dipsticks?\u00a0\u00a0There are pretty specific situations where one would use a dipstick, I doubt they are necessary at all for you.\u00a0\u00a0Just a waste of money.\u00a0\u00a0A urine dipstick is seldom going to show glucose, unless you have a very high level.In all honesty, it sounds like you've taken a lot of this in your own hands, which is never a good thing to do.\u00a0\u00a0You really need to be going by what your doc says.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't need home monitoring at this point, great!\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor will advise you when and if you do.",

            "answer": "Hi,glucose doesn't usually show in the urine until levels are high.Fasting glucose normally should be in the 80s/18 = around 4.5 - 4.9 (convert by multiplying by 18).\u00a0\u00a0There are 2 different measurements of blood glucose that are used.\u00a0\u00a0These can be confusing.A level of 5.9 x 18 = 106 2 hours after a light lunch are within nromal range.A level 11 x 18 = 198 2 hours after your evening meal is a concern and is way too high.\u00a0\u00a0What did you eat?Next step should be to get your Hba1c tested to see what your average sugars are.In the meantime reduce your carbs (breads, grains, pasta, sweet fruits, etc). and use portion control for carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Take regular exercsie and if you are overweight focus on getting closer to ideal weight.2 hours after eating blood sugars should be < 120 (6.6).Hope this helps.",

In the UK it is mmol/l.First things first, unless you went to ER because of extreme high blood sugars toss out [ignore] those test results. An illness, an infection, and/or trauma can elevate blood sugars levels above normal. Consider them false positives. Here are your blood sugar goals:Normal fasting is 3.33/3.88 to 5.5 mmol/lPostprandial [2-3 hrs after a meal] same as normal fasting. Above 6.72 mmol/l indicates diabetes issuesPlease understand testing and nutritional plans provided. Reply back to this thread if you need more clarification. Good luck -",

Some doctors allow diabetics to have postprandial up to 10.05 mmol/l, some say <7.83 mmo/l is OK, although most wish the patient to strive for <6.72 mmol/l. Mind you these levels are for diabetics, not normal folks.Your last fasting lab of 5.8 mmol/l says you tiny bit over the normal limit of 5.5 mmo/l. Eat healthy, exercise daily, lose excess weight, and no stress all help to lower blood sugars. Stress elevates blood sugar levels. As the saying goes \"No worry, no stress\".\u00a0\u00a0: -)",
