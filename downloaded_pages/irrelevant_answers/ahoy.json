            "answer": "im not sure about the white spots on your tongue, but the other symptoms are definitely the same as anxiety. and if your really paranoid about all these illnesses it really does just sound like anxiety. ive had it for almost a year and i have learnt is if you are thinking about it or expecting it to happen, then your body makes it happen, maybe when you eat you forget about it for a while? good luck sorry i dint email it x",

            "answer": "The feelings of anxiety may be related to low blood sugar, especially since you have a family history of it and because you say it tends to hit you 2-3 hours after eating.\u00a0\u00a0Low blood sugar can make you shaky, irritable, etc. which can feel a lot like an anxiety attack.I would suggest definitely geting your blood sugar tested - probably a glucose tolerance test as opposed to a simple blood glucose test.\u00a0\u00a0Also get the white patches checked out - if it's an infection, that can also sometime cause shakiness, etc. due to your body trying to fight the infection (which again can feel like anxiety)",

            "answer": "The white tongue is caused by yeast overgrowth.\u00a0\u00a0This is common in diabetic people, although other people can get it.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is common and you need to get checked for it ASAP.\u00a0\u00a0For the anxiety, try deep breathing and walking for exercise, but if your weight is up you're going to need to switch to a healthy diet and increase your exercise tolerance.\u00a0\u00a0But make the call to get your blood sugar checked tomorrow.",
