            "answer": "Its important to have a healthy diet during pregnancy but don't worry, I have had the same problem. At times all I can think about is fast food. Just make sure your getting some servings of fruits, veggies, whole grains and good proteins. You really don't have to be a health nut while pregnant although its encouraged. I would try and cut back though, you raise the risk of giving you and your baby gestational diabetes. Your dr will give you better advice though, so talk to him/her if you just can't seem to stay away from the junk food. We're pregnant, we get to indulge every so often ;)",

            "answer": "For my entire first trimester I was soo sick! 24 hour morning sickness. The only things I could eat we're fatty starches. Once that went away in my second, I was able to eat healthy again. I wouldn't worry too much as long as you put forth an effort moving forward. I am no super strict with my diet but I do make sure I get fruits and veggies in daily.",
