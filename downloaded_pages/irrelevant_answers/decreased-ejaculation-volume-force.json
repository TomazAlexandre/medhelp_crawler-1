            "answer": "Hello,You seem to be having erectile dysfunction. Common causes causing erection problem are stress and anxiety,poor communication with your partner, unrealistic sexual expectations, which make sex a task rather than a pleasure,negative feelings about non performance,smoking, alcohol and sometimes illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, spinal cord or neurological problems. Some of the drugs associated with this are blood pressure medications (especially beta-blockers), heart medications (such as digoxin), some peptic ulcer medications, sleeping pills, and antidepressants. Just check out the medications and if you are not taking any then all these causes ruled out.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and regards.",
