I hope that everything works out, but extremely small babies often turn out to have some type of dwarfism or other medical problems. Keep in mind that ultrasounds have room for error, especially if it was not done by someone experienced in OB ultrasounds.",

    "question": "Hello everyone.I am 31 wks pregnant now and am having some concerns. I recently went to my prenatal appt. and my doctor scheduled a next day ultrasound because I am small for the length of time I am pregnant. She told me she would notify me if there was need for worry. But Kaiser aren't always on their p's and q's. That same week I'm in labor and delivery experiencing pain. The on call doctor says my baby is only 15.7 grams. Tiny but ok, however she looked as though she was unsure. I have gained 21 puonds myself. Am I doing something wrong? This is my first pregnancy",
