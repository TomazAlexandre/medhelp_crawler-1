            "answer": "Hi there. This is a discussion board for hepatitis C which is different from steatohepatitis, which is NOT a virus.\u00a0\u00a0Fibroscan is good at the early stages of fibrosis (scarring) or the late stages (cirrhosis). It is not so good at the middle stages.Did your doc talk to you about your diet and exercise? Those are two important components to help control the progression of steatohepatitis. Also, alcohol is a big no-no for patients with fatty liver.That is all I know except it may be part of metabolic syndrome (pre-diabetes). Your doc should be advising you.",
