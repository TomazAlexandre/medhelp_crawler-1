    "question": "hi, I have a question about pain in left breast. My mom is >60 yrs old and she started to experience pain on and off since January this year. Pain is excruciating and lasts only few minutes at the time. Now I know that she has hight blood pressure, diabetes typy I well controlled w/ meds and diet. She is very scared even to go to pysician to have it checked because she thinks is brest cancer . No hx in the family. I did asked her if pain is really coming from her breast or is more as form her chest. She is specifically said it feels in her brest; she did go and talked w/ her doctor if she is ok w/ her BP and heart and was told everything is ok but she did not mention that has pain in her brest.Is there posiible to be brest cancer?Please help to figure out.Thanks.",
