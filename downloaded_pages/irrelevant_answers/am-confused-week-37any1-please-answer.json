            "answer": "Hi there.\u00a0\u00a0It is more then likely the diabetes - most babies born to diabetic moms are bigger then average.\u00a0\u00a0It is also very possible it's just genetics.\u00a0\u00a0Some babies are big.\u00a0\u00a0Remember Dr's tell you all the possible outcomes - that doesn't mean that you will need a c-section. Our bodies are meant to birth babies, and lots of women give birth naturally to big babies.\u00a0\u00a0However, if a c section is necessary, trust me, at the time you probably won't care. When I was told (while in labor) I would need an emergency c section the only thing that mattered to me was that he be here safe and healthy.\u00a0\u00a0That's what happened and at the end of the day, the most important thing.\u00a0\u00a0Congrats on your soon to arrive baby!\u00a0\u00a0Wishing you all the best.",
