            "answer": "Did you explain the nausea and headache to your physician? Did you tell him/her that you begin to feel better while you eat but soon after you are nauseated again.What is your eating habits like? Do you drink a lot of water and take vitamin(s)? Are you under a lot of stress? Are you skipping meals?I would suggest you go back to the doctor and make your symptoms clear to him/her and see what he thinks. How long has these bouts of nausea and headaches been going on? If your not already, I would suggest taking a multivitamin, omega 3, echineacea (it has anti-inflammatory properties) drinking a peppermint tea (peppermint oils are very useful for headache sufferers) decrease your red meat intake (if you eat it) eat more fruits and veggies. This will help to kind of detox any harmful toxins from your body.. plus, I am curious to know what your bowel habits are like... you can PM me if you'd like.. I hope you begin to feel better dear!!",
