            "answer": "Hi!Yes, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome can cause anhidrosis. However, anhidrosis can also be due to nerve damage secondary to diabetes, lupus, alcoholism, Ross syndrome and Horner\u2019s syndrome. Dehydration is also a common cause so drink plenty of fluids and see. It can also be the side effect of any medication you are taking.There is no exact treatment for it. When you have a lupus flare, move to an air conditioned place. Drink fresh fruit juice, cool water, and lemonade. Avoid coffee and tea as these also act as diuretics and cause water loss through urine formation.\u00a0\u00a0Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!",

    "question": "Can Sjogrens cause anhidrois? I also have Systemic Lupus.I cannot perspire at all and so my body can't cool itself.I feel like I need to \"sweat out\" toxins and cool off each time I have a lupus flare.Could this inability to perspire be from Sjogrens?Does anyone else have this problem?Thanks!",
