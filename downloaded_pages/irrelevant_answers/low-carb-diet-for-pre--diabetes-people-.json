            "answer": "Low carb diets can be healthy or not depending on what's included.\u00a0\u00a0Remember that vegetables are carbs, too, which is where Atkins when wrong -- not enough vegetables and their essential nutrients.\u00a0\u00a0Also keep in mind that there's no such thing as a Paleo diet, it's just a name -- as long as they've dug up our ancestors they've found chewed grains.\u00a0\u00a0But of course they were whole grains, not processed flours, and not all grains are created equal.\u00a0\u00a0Which is to say, there's a lot of room for experimentation out there for you, but be sure not to do a diet that doesn't include enough antioxidant and mineral rich foods, which is mostly vegetables and fruits.",

            "answer": "Atkins never said to not eat vegetables! What he stated was to not take in carbs. beyond the point of not giving off Keytones.The maximum number of grams of carbs, known as your personal carb balance, that you can consume while continuing to lose weight.http://www.atkins.com/AtkinsDotCom/media/Master/Programs/2013-carb-counter-%281%29.pdf",

            "answer": "Look at the independent research on Atkins.\u00a0\u00a0When I managed health food stores many of my customers tried Atkins, and he did in fact take them off vegetables for the most part until they reached a certain weight.\u00a0\u00a0When they added vegetables back in, they were very small portions.\u00a0\u00a0The independent research showed this diet did not do what was intended, which was not so much weight loss as to eliminate heart disease (I believe what Atkins died of) and didn't result in lasting weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0That's why you don't hear about it much these days.\u00a0\u00a0The newer low carb diets allow more vegetables, but the best diets is still one tailored to the individual, not some generalization.\u00a0\u00a0But of course, anyone is free to do whatever they want and hopefully get what they want out of it.\u00a0\u00a0I just think lifetime eating changes are better than generalized diets, and the research on most diets confirms that most people eventually just gain the weight back again.\u00a0\u00a0This is an area very much in the minds of FDA because so many claims are made and so few pan out, it's a very tough area, but I do wish everyone the best of outcomes.",
