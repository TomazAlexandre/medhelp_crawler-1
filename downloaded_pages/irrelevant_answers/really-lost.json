            "answer": "blood tests are pretty accurate for pregnancy. i had symptoms like that before, wasn't pregnant. it is possible that you could have a thyroid problem, which would explain the tired and actually even the period issues, however it could also be something more serious such as cancer of the cervix or diabetes. my friend had issues with her cycle, she had cancer of the ovaries, and diabetic and thyroid probs so, bottom line is you need to go to the dr pref a gyno asap to rule out the more serious issue with a pap, then have your blood tested for thyroid issues and diabetes hope this helps, good luck! any time your body acts so severely you must get checked.",

            "answer": "Yeah that would be pretty major if you went threw mentapause at 19 ha I'm 19 and couldn't even imganine that yet. Yeah well your 19 so you can be put on your mothers insurance until your 26 now. If that's not an option you should probably rest Medicare because it could really point to anything sypmtoms don't mean a lot really, but if you were pregnant then you would NEED insurance for your baby and delivery, check into it on the internet. It will be able to tell yoy a lot more but I know there are a lot of options and Medicare is a benifit. :) good luck.",

    "question": "At the begging of march i started to feel sick, all of my symptoms pointed to being pregnant, except theres a catch, my fiancee, had a partial vesctomy around 10years ago. I had done 4 or 5 urin tests, they all came back negative, so i had a blood test done as well, it was also negative.I would have just wrote it off as bein to worried if it wasnt for the fact, i went from march-october, without any kind of period. No nothing. Now tho, I have had my period since october. its now december, its like spotting, but it wont go away, Ive been, tired all the time, all the foods i use to love now make me sick. I either, throw up whatever I eat, or I eat, normally, and still feel hungry, im always tired, and moody. My fiancee tells me I remind him of his exwife, when she was pregnant with their first child. Im wondering what this could be, if its serious or normal.If you have any advice.. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, Help me out.",
