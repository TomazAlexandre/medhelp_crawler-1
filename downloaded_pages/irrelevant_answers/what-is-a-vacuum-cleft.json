    "question": "47 y.o. female with chronic low back pain first diagnosed in 2008.\u00a0\u00a0I was scuba diving on vacation last week when after the 3rd dive of the day I was sitting on the boat with my leg crossed and I started to get tingling and numbness in the left leg below the knee and foot.\u00a0\u00a0No other symptoms to suggest DCI..... I've had tingling before but always resolved it by stretching my leg out.\u00a0\u00a0This time I completely lost feeling below the knee for over 1 hour.\u00a0\u00a0It came back as soon as I got off the boat and started walking.\u00a0\u00a0No residual issues and was able to dive the next day without issue.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor ordered X-ray and MRI.\u00a0\u00a0 The insurance company is denying the MRI right now so only have the xray.Here's part of the report:\u00a0\u00a0 Comparison with exam of '08 was made.\u00a0\u00a0There are progressive degenerative disc changes at L4-L5 which include some uniform loss in disc space, progressive marginal spurring in addition to a vacuum cleft. (a couple of other notes not that important)I know the disc space if DDD.... what does the vacuum cleft mean?\u00a0\u00a0A google search doesn't give me any good info on this.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is it common or rare?",
