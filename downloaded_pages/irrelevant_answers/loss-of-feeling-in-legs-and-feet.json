            "answer": "Agree with Bill. I was diagnosed with \"peripheral neuropathy ....... associated with diabetes\" around 5 years post-tx. I had numbness in my toes spreading into my feet. It took a neurologist to catch the fact that I was insulin resistant - my family doc, who is diabetic himself, had always felt my blood sugar numbers \"weren't that bad\".Besides taking an oral insulin sensitizer (and trying to be good with diet and exercise), my neuro' doc also put me on a fancy form of B vitamin compounded with a glutathione precursor (CerefolinNAC). This seems to have stopped the spreading numbness when even keeping my blood sugar under control didn't seem to be doing much good.",

    "question": "I have lost feeling in my legs and feet. I took 6 months of therapy and I find it disconcerting when me ( the guinea pig ) tells a doctor about my problems and the act of not knowing what you are talking about comes over them. Listen I know that what I am feeling is real and instead of denying what happened to the lab guinea why not help the guinea pig get some help. I am 5 years out and I am very ill and cannot feel my legs and feet. Yes the med appears to have\u00a0\u00a0wrought SVR but the system is crashing. help me please.........",
