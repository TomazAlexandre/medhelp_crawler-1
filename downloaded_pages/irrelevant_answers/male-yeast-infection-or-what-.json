            "answer": "Hi Ashish,What other symptoms are present? It is good that the initial tests done were fine. I understand your concern regarding this and if the symptoms persist, it is important that you inform your attending physician for proper evaluation. Treatment for fungal infection usually takes a couple of weeks. Additional tests may be indicated to determine the underlying cause.\u00a0\u00a0Take care and do keep us posted.",
