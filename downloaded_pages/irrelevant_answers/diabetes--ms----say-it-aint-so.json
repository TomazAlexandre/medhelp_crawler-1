I've been cheating right now because of solumedrol, but the points thing has worked for me...50 pounds (until this solumedrol, probably popped up a bit). For me it helps to remember I'm doing this to prevent diabetes like my mother had...not doing it for ego. :) I love to snack and have learned the kinds of snacks that work for me and don't wreck my diet. When I started, I tried to look at each 1/2 pound as a victory. Now, if I way overeat or eat something really really high fat, I wind up throwing up because my body won't tolerate it. I don't ever want to put all that weight back on.",
