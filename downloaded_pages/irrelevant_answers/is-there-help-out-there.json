    "question": "Most of you have probably seen some of my concerns posted in the past about my 16 year old daughter with brittle diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0We have an awesome specialist in Nashville, TN but are still having a terrible time getting her straightened out.\u00a0\u00a0She was also diagnosed with having \"Pituitary Suppression\" and as having the insulin binding antibodies which make it very difficult to get her sugars leveled off.\u00a0\u00a0She is on the new insulin, Apidra, that is working well but the other issue still effects her sugars and cause her to go into DKA very rapidly.\u00a0\u00a0Her MRI showed a 1.5 mm microadenom that doesn't really concerned the doctors right now but with the problems she is having, everything I have read says the Pituitary gland is the main gland that is involved. My gut feeling tells me to have this checked out even further but I hate to go to another doctor as we have seen 4 specialist in the past and the one we have now is the one that found these problems and I trust her.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter also has problems with her menstrual cycle and this too could be a result of her diagnoses.\u00a0\u00a0No hormone pill that she has been on has helped at all.\u00a0\u00a0I am willing to take her somewhere for tests if someone can find out something.\u00a0\u00a0Let me know if anyone has any suggestions.\u00a0\u00a0I am afraid that if we don't get her healthy we will lose her way too soon. Thank you so much!\u00a0\u00a0I really am losing my mind......",
