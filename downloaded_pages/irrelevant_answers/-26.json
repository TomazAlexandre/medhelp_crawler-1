            "answer": "Hello,The breast tenderness and shoulder pain that you are having is a common side effect with yasmin use.Oral contraceptives can cause blood clots which can lead to blockage of any artery and hence pain and other symptoms like numbness and parasthesia and ischemic changes.Secondly,PCOS not only increases chances of heart problems,diabetes,high blood pressure and cancer of the lining of the womb (known as endometrial cancer),but it can cause breast tenderness also.Are you taking the treatment for your PCOS?I sincerely advise you to consult a gynecologist and discuss this with hi,/her.You can switch to some other birth control measure and see if the symptoms improve.If both these possibilities are ruled out then other possibilities causing similar symptioms like fibrocystic breast disease,ductal ectasia,mastitis(inflammation of breasts),galactoceles,benign and malignant pathologies of breasts,referred pain from liver or musculoskeletal system,arthritis of the ribs,costsochondritis and inflammation or sprain of pectoralis muscle have to be ruled out.Hope this helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts.",
