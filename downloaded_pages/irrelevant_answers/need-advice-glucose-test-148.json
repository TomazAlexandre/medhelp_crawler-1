I think you should really ask you OB if it would make a big difference if you take it when you get back. I don't think I fit the diabetes catagory either because I am not over weight but we will soon see. Enjoy your vacation:-)",

I might just wait until the 29th for my next appointment to deal with it then. I just feel like I am right on the border and if I didn't eat so much I would have passed.I did feel terrible though after the test...my legs were like jelly and my head felt dizzy.",

            "answer": "Well i was told its preferable to do it in the morning and to not eat or drink after midnight. My Glucose was 149 and was told the cut off was 140. I then went in the morning and did the 3 hour test and that was fine. I know you don't want to do testing again, but i think its important you take the 3 hr test. Everyone's body is different and breaks up sugar, calories etc... at a different rate. Good luck.Rossie",

            "answer": "I was told not to fast but not eat my regular fruit smootie for breakfast or anything that is sugary before the test. Mine came back bad at 152 and I failed the three hour test. My fast was at 104 which is fine then 188 at 1/2 hour,214 at 1 hr,152 at 2hr and 121 at 3 hour. I go to talk to my dr Monday about it. I felt fine and had no signs of it till this past week I get very tired after I eat and almost pass out. It shows more areound 28 weeks then 24-26 when alot of them test for it. I would get the 3hr. I did not get sick with it and it is worht getting it over with then you can always talk to the dr alter about it. I have only gained 8-9 lbs so far but I am over weight to begin with and the baby is measuring very large. He has to get weight checks was once a month now soon starting every two weeks. Best of luck and let us know what happens!",

            "answer": "I failed the 1 hr also with 152 out of the 140 they want me at. I go in on Friday for the 3hr test. I am a bit overweight but haven't gained THAT much and not quickly at all (17lbs total) My last 2 children were over 9lbs though I wasn't tested for GD back then. I'm just crossing my fingers that I pass this time. I got REALLY sick from the glucose test with the 1 hr and even threw up as son as my blood draw was done (I didn't eat before the test because the nurse told me I shouldn't). They said if I cant hold it down then I'll have to start on the GD diet plan and then do the 1hr test again in a few weeks. Awesome! :(Does anyone know if they always make you do insulin if you fail the 3 hr or is it something that can be controlled with diet? I cant seem to find that info online.",

    "question": "Hey ladies,Well I just got my results back for my glucose test and it was 148. 140 is considered the limit. They want me to come back and do the 3 hour test, but I am leaving in a few days for vacation, and I really don't know if I can even make it back for that.My baby is measuring normal, and I didn't gain too much weight...just about 19 lbs so far and am on the lighter side. And I was a little underweight at conception too.I just don't seem to fit the diabetes catagory and was already nervous about taking the first glucose test bc of all the sugar going into the baby. Now they want to double the sugar. I was reading that most who get slightly elevated at the first one end up testing normal at the second one. I just don't want to do this for no reason, and I really don't want to do it before my trip because it is in the hospital and I have been trying to stay quarantined so I don't catch a cold before we fly (I have inner ear damage that would make flying with a cold a nightmare and it's a 10 hour flight...not to mention the first time we ever did something like this and I don't want to risk getting sick for it).I guess I wanted advice on what to do. like if i should take the test before I go away or do you think it can wait until I get back on the 28th. Do you think it is even necessary with it only being slightly elevated..?I just hate testing and procedures that may turn out unecessary.\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts or experiences would be appreciated.Thanks girls",
