At least you're getting the 3 hr test, I wasn't given the option.Have you noticed any signs or symptoms?-irritability-short of breath-increased mouth dryness-headaches-blurred visionThese are some of the symptoms I was told, honestly I've only had about two which makes me doubt I'm diabetic.",

            "answer": "Most times they just treat with diet. Buterus that would mean you would be on a strict healthy diet. If for some reason you can't control it with diet they may put you on medication for it. I know some women do end up having baby early but just as many or more have baby close to their due dates. They will probably watch baby\u00a0\u00a0close just to make sure baby keeps developing and to see how big baby gets. There's the chance of baby being big with this but that isn't always the case either. I would try not time worry to much yet (even though that's hard to do). My Dr wants me to do the test at 28weeks so I still have four weeks to go with this baby before I do it. Goodluck on your 3hr one",

            "answer": "Calm down... its gonna ne okay... thats why your doctor is monitoring you... so now you will go in for your 3 hour test-- its a total of 4 blood tests... they will tell you that you need to increase your carb intake by 1 extra gram 3 times a day and give you a list of what to eat to that is that measurements... on the day of your test... you start fasting at midnight and go in 1st thing in the morning... they take your fasting blood sugar levels, then you drink the sugary drink... 1 hr later they draw your blood, and also at 2 and 3 hrs... bring a book or something to do (I brought my ipad) so you arent soo bored... they will tell you the results after 1 or 2 days... they say if you fail 2 or more of those 4 tests than you have gestational diabetes- I failed 2. I had to go back in the next week to talk over the results, be given a sample diet and explain what their course of action is involving your pregnancy... most women can control it with diet but some need to take medication- either metformin or insulin (if it's really bad)... but its important to monitor your blood sugar levels (if you have it)... I have to check blood sugar levels 4 times a day, change my diet, and go to the doctor more- they also imcrease the frequency of ultrasounds but that wasnt new for me since they were monitoring my baby's growth from the beginning... hopefully you dont have it but if you do its manageable... I will retested for diabetes 6 werks after delivery",

            "answer": "Calm down and breathe! I have type 2 diabetes so I've had this the whole time I've been pregnant. I am now 32 weeks pregnant and everything is great. I see a specialist, a perinatologist, every other week on top of my regular OB. They monitor me with ultrasounds everytime I come in and I've also seen a fetal cardiologist to check the baby's heart cause with the extra insulin that you produce can be passed to the baby which causes thickening of the heart. This sounds scary but with the right doses of meds and watching your sweets and carbs intake it's very manageable. The thickening of the heart causes the baby to grow a little faster than normal but as long as you keep your sugar levels in check you and your baby will be fine. My fetal cardiologist can't stress this enough. So if you do fail the 3 hour test don't worry to much, your doctors will be on top of it. Your stress will do more harm than the GD. Stay calm and take everything one step at a time.",

This keeps your blood sugar level in a target range. When you are pregnant, the placenta makes hormones that can make it harder for insulin to work. This is called insulin resistance.A pregnant woman can get diabetes when her\u00a0pancreas\u00a0cannot make enough insulin to keep her blood sugar levels within a target range.That's what cause gd..",

I know there has been posts on this but i dont have the patience to search endless posts for it right now.I have not freaked out since the middle of my second trimester! Im soooo mad! I had to change doctors.just to get this test because the dr i was seeing did not even give me blood work and i was seeing her every 2 to 3 weeks since i was 7 weeks.
