            "answer": "I'm not an expert on the subject, but all I can say is, that during times of stress you're just distracted enough (even during intercourse) that you lose erection fairly quickly.I say so because I myself am 21 and have been through this stage recently. This is PURELY stress related and as you can guess by my nickname, I am a stress-fed too! :)I had the same notions about having STD's or other abnormalities, but my girlfriend and I sat down and had a fairly lengthy discussion, and pretty soon I realized that it was merely stress taking over everything. Fortunately, my girlfriend understands too that this is the time to focus on our careers and hence is very supportive.You are in every way normal and this tendency is very normal as well. It's merely a result of the distraction caused by all the stress. Don't worry, it's a temporary phase. I know it's scary, but it will pass.Hope my comments help :)",

    "question": "I am a 21 year old male, who for the past few months believes he has been suffering slightly from ED. I sometime over the past few months I have had a hard time getting a full erection. Most of the time, when having sex with my girlfriend, I am able to successfully become around and achieve climax. However, I have noticed certain changes in my sex life: I never had a problem with losing an erection during sex, yet during the past few months this has happened several times. Additionally, I feel that my erections are often not as rigid or stiff as they used to be. Finally, I often lose my erections quickly if not being stimulated. My girlfriend, however, says she doesn't notice anything abnormal, however I feel there is.I have seen my doctor several times about this. He has done physical exams, taken blood, and has deduced that I do not suffer from any STD, from diabetes, or hormone deficiency. He believes I am under too much stress, which may be true, although I feel I was stressed in the past and never suffered from this. He has said that since I am able to orgasm, I would not worry about it being a physical problem.So, apparently I am under too much stress. Unfortunately, I am a huge worry wort, so now it seems to be a downward spiral. I worry about pleasing my girlfriend, I worry about never being \"normal\" again, and so on. Has anyone else been in this position and how did they overcome it?",
