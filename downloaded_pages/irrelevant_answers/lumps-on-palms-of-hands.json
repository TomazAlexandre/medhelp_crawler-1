    "question": "I have developed callous type lumps on the palms of my hands over the last 6 months. They are centred around the 2 middle fingers. They are beginning to affect the straightening of my hands. If I force the straightening I feel a tearing sensation. My fingers and knuckles etc have no bumps or deformities associated and all appear normal. The growths are very dense and hard. I have attached a photo of them. I have compared them to photos of arthritis suffers and they don't appear at all similiar\u00a0\u00a0but is this the early stages? Any insight would be appreciated.",
