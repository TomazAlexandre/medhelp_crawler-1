            "answer": "Hi and welcome,You've posted on the weekend and its often quiet so dont be surprised if you dont receive many responses, its just the timing of it. My opinion is that this isn't likely to be MS, having depression doesn't exclude anyone from physiological disease and its quite common to have anxiety and or depression because of a disease.Still i suspect the medications and timing of sx are some how connected, its not unheard of for anxiety medications to actually have the reverse affect and make things worse, it can be trial and error before finding the right one for you. Have you looked at the medications you take and there individual side affects as well as there combined side affects, it might be worth looking into. Anxiety is a possibility as is the medications you take to treat it.Mornings are also a common problem due to the length of time between your medications so this is another important point to speak to your doctor and or therapist about. Another thing to think about is finding something that helps you decompress, something that gives you time to disconnect from day to day life. Some find music or drawing helpful and others need to do something physical so they need sport or hard labour, something that they enjoy and takes them out of their head space for a time.Cheers...........JJbtw I dont think your crazy or untreatable, give it some time and dont be too hard on your self whilst your working things out!",

            "answer": "Hi artistlike and welcome.\u00a0\u00a0This doesn't sound like MS to me, either, but I'm not medical doctor and definitely not an expert in your case.I don't know about allergy - I heard an allergist just last week say that allergy season quiets during the summer and that is when allergy doctors take their longest vacations. Springtime when everything is in bloom is difficult and late summer for the ragweed/hayfever season is another time.\u00a0\u00a0but he said during the summer months there aren't really seasonal allergies.\u00a0\u00a0You might have food allergies, though?By any chance have you been ill lately with a virus?\u00a0\u00a0We do hear of residual symptoms from viruses causing pins and needles and other creepy crawly feelings for months afterwards.I hope you find your answers - there is nothing worse than feeling ill and not knowing why.good luck, Lulu",

    "question": "For the second year, I am experiencing disturbing symptoms that as of yet have been undiagnosed and I am feeling desperate. One day about two weeks ago, my right foot and lower leg \"fell asleep,\" accompanied by painful pins-and-needles sensations that persisted severely for about a half hour and then mildly for several hours. At the same time, my vision in one eye became blurry to the point that driving home in the dark was a frightening experience. Since then, I have noticed that, while I generally can walk normally, about every five to ten minutes, my legs become uncoordinated and I stumble and from that point on have to walk slowly and carefully for at least several minutes before I am \"back to normal.\" All day today and yesterday, I have felt extreme dizzy, haven't been able to concentrate even on television, and I am seeing \"floaters\" in my field of vision. I feel as if I am tipsy, but I have not had any alcohol.I had all these symptoms last year for the first time (although the blurred vision has occurred for many years now). He prescribed a litany of blood tests, including tests for diabetes, HIV1 and HIV2, as well as MRIs with and without contrast of my brain and lower back. All tests were normal, with the exception of a slight disc bulge and nerve crowding in L5-S1. After that, I had painful EMG tests, which also were \"normal.\" I have for most of my life experienced severe depression and, over the past several years, occasional panic attacks, so I am now in therapy and being treated with a low dose of Zoloft and Wellbutrin as well as very low (1/4MG twice daily) dose of Klonopin to prevent panic attacks.All the symptoms mentioned in the first paragraph subsided from late last summer through until recently. I have been phasing out Klonopin under the direction of my psychiatrist and did not take it this morning. After the vertigo/confusion became very upsetting, I took Klonopin in the hope that I was having a panic attack and the symptoms would subside, but they have not. Both of my feet and my fingertips are tingling slightly, my vision is slightly \"off\" (not exactly blurry, but it's as if my eyes cannot focus in tandem--but not double vision, either), and I am so dizzy that I plan to lie down and try to sleep as soon as I am done writing this. I was in bed all day yesterday because of these symptoms.I don't know what to do next, if there is anything I can do. My insurance did not pay for the neurological tests, nor will it cover my psychiatric appointments (though it covers the three medications I am on, which haven't affected my symptoms one way or another). My psychiatrist said it is possible that my anxiety may be causing these symptoms and to focus on trying to be less anxious. I've tried everything, but this seems to be beyond my control. Since this is occurring at approximately the same time of year as last year (last year it began in April and persisted through, probably, August or September, and it just started in mid-May), is it possible that the cause could be seasonal allergies? I've tried taking antihistamines, but they don't have any effect. I'm feeling desperate. I can't concentrate at work and I can't psych myself to get out of bed. Any ideas, or am I just crazy and untreatable?",
