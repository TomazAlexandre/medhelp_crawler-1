    "question": "It seems like no matter how much I drink I am always thirsty, especially when I am on my period. I can drink a large water bottle of water and within a few minutes I'm thirsty again. I don't have diabetes or blood pressure problems so it doesn't make sense.\u00a0\u00a0Do any of you have this problem or know what can cause what seems like an endless thirst? Thank you in advance",
