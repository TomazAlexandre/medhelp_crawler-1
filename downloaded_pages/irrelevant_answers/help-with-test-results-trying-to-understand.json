Thanks, as I didn't know the term \"Flat Curve,\" but knowing that now, it allowed me to research this morning and find some research and journal articles, which seem to show that this is not a diabetes precursor, thank goodness! That I am extremely insulin sensitive, and not resistant. I like the idea of getting a meter and testing.I do think I need to increase my thyroid meds and plan to talk to my endo about that!",

    "question": "Hi everyone!I am new here. I really could use some help understanding my test results. I have researched on my own, and I am not having much luck. I am wondering if someone wants to take a stab at helping me to interpret these test results, and/or point me to resources that might help me better understand?I had full metabolic and CBCs done last week. I am 50 years old, knocking on menopause's door. I am on a low dose 0.025 \"starter\" estrodial patch and 100 mg of progesterone for night sweats. I also have a thyroid issue and take 90 mg daily of dessicated thyroid. I do have one small thyroid nodule.I have gained 30 lbs in the last 4 years. Nothing - and I do mean NOTHING takes the fat off. Calorie restriction. Low carb high fat. Moderate carb/higher protein. Weight loss medication (Phentermine). Exercise is dance class 2-3X a week, and strength training 3x. I have a job where I stand a lot. My diet when I am not attempting to lose fat is has been very high carb in the past, as sugar and sweet cravings the last few years have been off the chart. Like... I cannot even describe how bad the sugar cravings have been. The low dose estrogen seems to help with that a bit.I am 5'7\" and weigh 166. My normal weight is around 140.An Oral Glucose Tolerance Test was done to see if I am insulin resistant. When the results came back, the endocrinologist was \"intrigued\" and \"interested\" but didn't really give me any information except that I should eat lower carb to lose weight and come back in 3 months. Well, that would be terrific - except...weight does not come off. I lose like 3 pounds then all weight loss comes to a halt.So... please let me know what you think of these test results? Do I need to be proactive with anything?If I have left out any other relevant info, please let me know. I really am at a loss of what I should be worried about (or not!) and where to go next.All results fasting from food and meds (only thing I take is thyroid med)OGTT - Blood GlucoseFasting 841 hr 842 hr 88OGTT InsulinFasting 3.51 hr 32.82 hr 18.3A1C (done last month: 5.7\u00a0\u00a0- (this was down from 5.8 in February.
