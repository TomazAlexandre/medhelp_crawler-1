    "question": "My 3 year old daughter has night terrors, night sweats, and is extremely moody.\u00a0\u00a0If you tell her no, sometimes she's fine with it...or sometimes she'll start whining and throwing a fit like a normal 3 year old...but there are OTHER times when she flat out tantrums like she's out of control.\u00a0\u00a0Her behavior is very similar to the behavior in her night terrors - shaking, seeming like she's somewhere else, screaming/crying, etc.\u00a0\u00a0At these times, it \"feels\" like it's chemical and she has no control over it.\u00a0\u00a0I've read online that tantrums like these and night terrors are sometimes linked to bipolar.\u00a0\u00a0But, she's so young, I'm afraid I won't find a doctor who would take it seriously with her age.\u00a0\u00a0Thoughts?",
