            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!A heat sensation or sudden feeling of warmth can be a sign of blood clot or deep vein thrombosis. It can also be due to pinched nerve or due to diabetic neuropathy. For diagnosis first a duplex ultrasound or color dopplar would need to be done. If this is negative then a nerve conduction study and test for diabetes. If there is a chance then if everything else is negative, then lupus may need to be tested for.Other than this\u2014it can also be a variant of restless leg syndrome. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
