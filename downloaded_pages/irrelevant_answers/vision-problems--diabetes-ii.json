            "answer": "I can not really answer if it is the Actos or not but diabetes can cause vision problems and prescription changes especially when first diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0As the sugar levels rise and fall in your cells they rise and fall in ALL of your cells.\u00a0\u00a0Including the cells in your eyes and eye muscles.\u00a0\u00a0This is what creates the vision changes.\u00a0\u00a0As Blood Sugar levels stabilize so will the vision.\u00a0\u00a0I am type 1 and when I was diagnosed my sugars were over 800.\u00a0\u00a0My vision was soooo bad that I could not see the syringe to be able to give myself the correct dosage of Insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Now all is back to normal.\u00a0\u00a0But things do not stabilize overnight.\u00a0\u00a0Check into the Actos thing and be patient for the stabilizing vision if that is not the answer.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your reply! I feel much more comortable having my husband kinda \"wait it out\" for a while. I do think it's the blood sugar, since you said it taks a while to nornalise. Your not being able to see the syringe sounds like what my hubby is going thu- he needs a magnifying glass for everything! But it sounds like it's just part of it. Wow, 800 is high! I'm glad things are going better now.Thanks again!-Dee",

    "question": "Hi all,My hubby was dx'ed 2 weeks ago w/ diabetes II. His regular doc put him on 30 mg Actos daily. At 1st hubby's blood sugar was a whopping 390- now it's down to 76-90 in the am and no more than 180 even after lots of sugary food. Obviously the blood sugar is well under control now. The problem is, my husband's vision is going crazy! I know that diabetes can cause vision problems when blood sugar is high, but the way it's happening doesn't make sense. Before he was diagnosed, he was gradually becoming more and more farsighted. Then, after his blood sugar dropped to normal, his vision got much better- he didn't even need his glasses anymore! Now, during this past week, his eyes have gotten very bad. It's frightening- he needs a magnifying glass just to see the letters on his computer keyboard, and he needs my help reading almost everything. His vision has never been like this before, not even when his blood sugar was at 390.Now the Actos info says that it can cause vision changes, though it's rare. It also says to call a physician immediately if that happens! We called his doctor (who isn't the brightest bulb on the block, btw) and he insisted it couldn't be from the Actos- suggested hubby see his eye doctor. The opto doc said there is nothing wrong with hubby's eyes, he just needs new glasses. Nobody is giving us any answers!!Is there anyone on here that has had vision changes like this? Was it from Actos, or diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0I'd appreciate any advice or input.Thanks!-Dee",
