    "question": "Hi everyone... I am currently 32wks pregnant with my second child (another boy). Back in 2005 I became pregnant with my first son but at 28wks was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes, was able to control my sugar with diet but stil had an 8lb6oz healthy boy... My question is if this pregnancy is going better... I tested negative for gestational Diabetes... would I still have a larger baby or could there be a chance this baby could be smaller?",
