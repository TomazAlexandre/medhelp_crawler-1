            "answer": "Hey there Charmin, I am a 30 yr old female recently diagnosed with MS. Just wanted to share my first and only symptoms that I experienced.First my toes went numb, then about a week later my feet started to go numb another week later below my knees went numb so pretty much anything below my knees were numb. Now when I say numb I mean I can still feel things but just a different sensation. A few weeks later I started to go numb in my waist. 2 weeks after I got the initial numbness in my toes, feet and legs I went to the doctor and started the testing process! They were all over it, I did a full blood panel to check for diabetes, iron etc came back normal, then tested for RH arthritis and lupus came back negetive, did an EMG to check for nerve damage or a pinched nerve, again came back normal then did an MRI, which was used to diagnose my MS.Now with all of that being said, clearly tingling, numbness and pain could be because a number of different things. I would def talk to your doctor and get testing done! The sooner the better :)I was not aware of MS being in my family until after I found out. I have a second cousin on my mothers side and my dads side UGH! I was screwed LOL! Good luck to you and I hope everything turns out to be just fine!",
