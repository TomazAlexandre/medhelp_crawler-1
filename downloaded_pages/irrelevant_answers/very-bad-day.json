            "answer": "Sorry to hear all the problems you and your parents are going thru. My life is like that but you can only take it one day at a time, easily said then done i know. Your attempt at the cabin was a good idea but you have to take care of your dad. Dont think because you went and got some lortab that you cant continue your recovery, just try not to get anymore. Lortab was my DOC and know how hard it is to get off, just try not to get to side tracked with all that is going on. I wish you and your family the best and pray your father gets well and that you and your mother can get clean.",

    "question": "For those who are not sure, I just got back from a cabin from detoxing. Last night my dad which is a diabetic we found out that he hadn't taken his diabetic medication for over a week and he was feeling aweful. He is also an alcoholic and opiate abuser. Well he looked so pale and every time he stood up he felt like he was going to pass out. Well my mom made a Dr. appt. for him and then he wasn't going to go so she called his boss(who she used to work for also) and said that he absolutely had to go to the Dr. appt. The boss was cool and agreed but he called my dad and my dad found out that she called him and he got home and raised h***(She had quit her job a few months ago due to heart problems and Drs orders.) So he brought up that she quit her job and she keeps screwing him over.(He didn't like that we went to a cabin to try and detox) it got so bad that my mom and I left and are now moving to West Virginia From Jacksonville right now we are staying with a friend and she is filing for a divorce because he has been treating her like **** because she quit her job and he doesn't care enough to go to the doctor to refill his diabetic meds so he won't die. Which the doctor told him about five years ago that if he didn't quit drinking and stuff that he would die in five years(time is just about up) My mom felt hurt because he doesn't care enough about us to go to the doctor and get his diabetes meds. under control so he won't Get sicker than he already is. I don't think my dad has much time left on this earth and no matter our differences I love him so much and will miss him and don't want him to die, and it hurts that he doesn't care enough for us to want to live. So given all of that I had made it 7 days and today after all of the fighting, packing, and crying, I relapsed. I got 15 10mg Lortabs and I dealt with my depression by taking them which I regret. I'm sorry to all and thank you for all of your prayers I probably won't be on here for a while and I just want to say to everyone please be strong (unlike me)you all are in my prayers and thank you so much for everything.",
