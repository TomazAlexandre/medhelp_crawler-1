            "answer": "Hi!Well, presence of mirror pattern oligoclonal bands which means the bands are similarly present in both cerebrospinal fluids (CSF)and in serum more or less rules out MS, as in this case the bands are present only in CSF.The complement test could be high due to recent infections. You probably have a reactive arthritis secondary to infection.Unexplained aches and pains coming on and off could be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, anemia, liver disorders, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Vit B12 or Vit D deficiency and due to calcium or magnesium deficiency. It can also be due to sleep related disorders. In women it can be due to hormonal disturbances related to PCOD/menopause and in men it can be due to low testosterone. Severe anemia, and parathyroid gland disorders can also be the cause. Autoimmune disorders, multiple sclerosis and peripheral neuropathies due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme or lupus too should be investigated for.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
