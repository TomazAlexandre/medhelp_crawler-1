            "answer": "I don't think it matters. This is something I would look up or ask a doc about, but there are healthy ppl at healthy weights everywhere who end up diabetic or were born at a greater risk. Every pregnant woman I've known has had to drink the icky concoction. Also, I eat very healthy, especially since finding out about LO, and at a healthy weight, but my mother had gestational diabetes with me, so I'm at a greater risk anyway. So definitely talk to your doc, or at least Google it for now. I've heard the drink is terrible, but there's nothing we wouldn't do to ensure the health of our babies, right?",

            "answer": "Sometimes they will let you eat jellybeans instead of drinking the liquid. I eat the appropriate number of Surf Sweets jellybeans. They taste better than most jellybeans and are organic, use natural dyes and real fruit as flavorings. I use them because the drink contains something I am allergic to but I've had friends who were told they could do the jellybean because they didn't want to drink the\u00a0\u00a0liquid. You have to eat a certain number of jellybeans in a certain amount of time. Ask your doctor.",
