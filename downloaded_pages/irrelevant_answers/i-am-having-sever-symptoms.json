            "answer": "Where to start\u2026Sasha, it sounds like you understand that uncontrolled diabetes is very risky; along with the rest of your chosen lifestyle; I won\u2019t waste any time lecturing you about the crank. If you live in the U.S., go to the county health department, and see if they can help with any of this.You need to prioritize your needs; stop using, figure out how to manage your blood sugar, and then get tested for HIV, viral hepatitis, etc. If you\u2019re drinking, it can raise your liver enzyme levels; however, this probably takes a back seat to your other problems. Getting some form of control over your current lifestyle sounds like the most important thing you can do at this time.Be kind to yourself; you won\u2019t last long like this\u2014Bill",

    "question": "My name is Sasha and I am 20 years old So I am not 100% sure that I have Hepatitis C but, I have been having unprotected sex with my boyfriend for the past 4 months who HAS Hepatitis C. I use(d) his toothbrush and razors. He has sores that bleed and it gets all over the bedding. About 3 weeks ago I went to the ER my blood work said that my live enzymes were elevated.For the past 2-3 weeks I have been doing my usual thing but I get so tired and by the end of the night I feel exhausted even if I don't do much. I have also noticed that I have bruises everywhere all over my legs and some on my arms. I get really bad urges to pee but I have to strain really hard to manage to get a stream going. For the past 3-4 days I have had horrible diarreah it\u2019s so bad I can't leave the house my stools are bright yellow and slimy. I would go to the doctor to get it all checked out but I have no insurance and limited transportation. I should also mention the fact that since I lost my insurance a year ago I have been an untreated diabetic. My meter broke so I have no way of knowing what my blood sugar levels are and that effects how I feel too. I also have started smoking Meth about6 months ago I used to only do it maybe 1-2 a month, but I having been using more and more so I don\u2019t feel quit so awful and tired. I know that drugs are really not helping my situation but please understand that it\u2019s a very hard thing to kick but I do want to stop using. And unlike you would assume I have never injected myself with it. I'm not sure what symptoms go with what problem I'm having. So what I'm asking is if the symptoms could be a sign that I have chronic hepatitis C and what would you do if your were in my situation? I am desperate to find some sort of direction to go and what I should do.thank-you for taking your time to read this and hopefully give me suggestions!Sincerely,Sasha",
