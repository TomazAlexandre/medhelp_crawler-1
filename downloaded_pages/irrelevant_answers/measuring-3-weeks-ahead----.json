            "answer": "There is really no way to tell how big the baby will be at birth - especially because size estimates from a sono can be SO off. I measured big with my older son all through the pregnancy...sometimes as much as six weeks ahead. Then the day my water broke, they estimated he was almost 7 pounds at 36.5 weeks. He ended up being almost NINE pounds. He is still a HUGE kid and he's ten. My last son measured slightly big all through the pregnancy - toward the end a little bigger. The day before I had him they estimated he was 8.5 pounds at 36 weeks. He ended up being 6 lbs 10 oz. So, with both boys, they were WAY off.As for steroids, no it doesn't make the baby bigger - just helps lung development.",
