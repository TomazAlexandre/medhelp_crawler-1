            "answer": "When I did my 20 week ultrasound the fluid and baby looked fine so they havet said anything else until I failed both sugar test. The nurse then called me in meds to take 2x a day. And said I would have another scan later in the pregnancy. I was having trouble with the meds making me dizzy and my sugar would get to low. So they changed my dose and I ask about a ultrasound and she said the 20 week was fine so they don't usually do any more. So I was wondering. I go back the 17 (will be 30 weeks and 2 days) then I don't know when I will go back or if they will do another u/s.",

            "answer": "If they need to do an ultrasound I'm sure they will. Just focus on what you can control which is taking your meds and watching your sugar level.",
