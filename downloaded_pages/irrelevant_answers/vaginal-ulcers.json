            "answer": "Hi! Ulcers in this area are usually due to syphilis, herpes, chancroid, granuloma inguinale, and lymphogranuloma inguinale. Hence a STD panel should be donefor this. Other possibilities are disseminated lupus erythemosus, cancers, and Bechet\u2019s disease. There is another possibility\u2014an allergic reaction to something (cream, lotion, razor, soap, tampon, condom, sanitary pad). It can also be due to trauma during sex not healing due to diabetes. It is difficult to comment beyond this on net. Please consult your gynecologist. Take care!",

            "answer": "I'm no doctor but it's sound a little bit like something I've had in the past. I got the same symptoms and went to my Ob/Gyn and the diagnosis for me was Cervical Dysplasia (pre-cancer cells that show up in forms of blisters). Eventually I had to undergo surgery to remove the ones that were in the inside that one cannot see. It was an outpatient procedure and I was fine to go home the same day. If it turns out to be that and it goes untreated it will turn into cervical cancer. I suggest a visit to your Ob. Good luck!",

    "question": "I discovered 3 maybe 4 vaginal ulcers. I first thought that I had been just dry when I had intercourse with my boyfriend and we may have been a little rough and it was a tear and would go away. Now over a month in a half later I still have them. They are most painful during sex and when urinating. I know for a fact that this is not herpes.... They are not getting any better and I keep reading that other women have experienced this same issue and no one seeems to know what they are. This is really hindering my sex life. It is so painful to have sex.... Someone please help this is terribly annoying and they are so painful you cant even know...This discussion is related to/posts/show/534184.",
