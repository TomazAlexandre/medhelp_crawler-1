            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes recurrent yeast infection and hunger, dry mouth and frequent urination definitely point towards diabetes. Please get fasting blood sugar, blood sugar 2 hours after food and glycosylated hemoglobin (this gives last 3 months blood glucose status) done to rule out diabetes. If the reports point towards diabetes please take treatment from a specialist.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hello. Some of this information I will share with you is a little personal. But I'd really like some help before I go into a doctor and get called a hypochondriac, or go through an experience where the doctors think im blatantly lying to them.Anyways. Im having reoccurring yeast infections on the mouth (angular cheilitis) and vaginal. I am also much hungrier than usual, constantly craving food and usually eating every two hours. I dont usually have much of an appetite.[But before assumptions are made im not sexually active.] My mouth and throat are also very dry, especially at night. Im also urinating frequently.I dont know what could cause all this. If its not diabetes than what might it be?",
