            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The nerve innervating (supplying) the thumb, the index finger and the middle fingers is the median nerve. This can get compressed in the wrist, leading to numbness of these areas leading to a condition called Carpel Tunnel Syndrome. The nerve can get compressed due to obesity, Diabetes Mellitus, hypothyroidism, arthritis and trauma, these causes will have to be dealt with.The carpal tunnel (at your wrist through which the median nerve passes) changes its size depending on the position of the wrist. It\u2019s widest when wrist and hand are straight in line. When the hand is bent up or down, the tunnel becomes slightly smaller. This then presses on the nerve which then causes a pain right up to the arm. Often proper working style, working without bending wrist, using smooth movements to operate the mouse and key pad, and relaxing the joints of finger, wrist and arm in between helps. A wrist support or arm support too helps and you have computer chairs with support for your spine and arm.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The compression may take time and may be happening at that time. But if you have tingling of toes also, neuropathy may need to be considered, which is a disorder of the nerves. Most common cause is diabetes. This also happens with metabolic disorders, vitamin deficiencies, infections and traumatic injuries. Discuss these options with your consulting doctor.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "For about a month or two now I've awakened every morning around 4 with thumbs all fingers except the little finger asleep or tingling. Sometimes both hands, sometimes one or the other. I'm not sleeping on my hands. I have seen a doctor about this. Suggested it was classic of carpal tunnel, tho no other symptoms of same. Tried wearing braces on wrists at night. Problem persists. Any ideas?",
