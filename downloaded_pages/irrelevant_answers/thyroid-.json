    "question": "I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer 12 years ago, had papilary and tall cell deviant. I had a tyroidectomy, then a neck dissection, and finally 2 more susrgeries to remove cancerous nodules. I have been on Levoxyl 137MCG for most of that time. I had an excellent docotr specializing in throid nodules, but moved and deal with an MD who mostly deals with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My TSH is .138, I am always hot, have not lost weight, and typically am extremely tired especially about 1 hour after taking meds.What do you think?",
