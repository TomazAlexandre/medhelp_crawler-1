    "question": "I am on 900mg lithium, 600mg Seroquel, 80mg propanolol, 0.5mg Klonopin as needed for situational anxiety + Nexium and 100mg Ultram for arthritis. I started taking these meds about 10 mos ago. I have gained over 70lbs since starting these meds, although all the wheight was put on in the first 5 mos.. I know Seroquel is the culpret. Here is my problem I cannot lose any weight, I excercise as much as possible (jog 1/2 mile walk 1/2 mile) and only eat 1 meal a day. I have had to go to a clinical dietition because of high cholesterol that my cardiologist does'nt like. My blood glucose keeps getting higher and higher, as a matter of fact my therapist called for my psychiatrist yesterday to tell me I need to talk to my PCP, I don't even want to know. I have HCV and am do to start Interferon/ Ribivirin treatment on the 28 Aug 07 and if I let my liver doctor they will postpone my HCV meds. I have already beem waiting a year because of this damn bi-polar. I was hoping the hcv treatment would help me lose some Lbs. Please let me know what you think I need to do>>",
