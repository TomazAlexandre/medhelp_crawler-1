    "question": "I just got a call from the study group in which I just had labs and bx. They told me I had blood in my urine and asked if it was that time of month. Of course my luck it is. He told me this was an exclusion for this study. He said he would contact whomever higher up and see what could be done considering I had good (negative) results last\u00a0\u00a0time. They had to test me again something about the labs before were more than 35 days old. Does anyone have a suggestion as to whats next. As in last post all other numbers optimal you know with the exception of the pcr and alt ast.\u00a0\u00a0I travel a long way, I am willing travel once more to do another urine sample.",
