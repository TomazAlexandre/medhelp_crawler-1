            "answer": "My husband has struggled with boils (hidratenitis supperativa) for years. He uses antibacterial soap (Safeguard bar soap) in the shower and takes daily baths with about 1 cup of powdered borax (ten mule box is fine). It is important to let the area dry as much as possible. He will get them in the groin sometimes and has found that wearing boxers helps a lot as it prevents the briefs from irritating the area. The other thing that has really helped has been taking turmeric in capsule form (he takes the equivalent of 1-2 tsp. a day). There are lots of recipes online for turmeric in teas and soups, but he doesn't like the taste. If the boils are really bad and don't heal after all these efforts, he will take a round of antibiotics.",

            "answer": "I like the natural approach as well.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't change what Babrams819's husband is doing in that regard, because it certainly is a great natural solution.\u00a0\u00a0And, definitely curcumin supplement is necessary even if one does enjoy the taste of turmeric, because it's next to impossible to get sufficient curcumin by ingesting turmeric alone.\u00a0\u00a0So, yeah, he will be happy to hear that one.One huge thing that all of us need to consider is sugar and grain intake.\u00a0\u00a0Especially sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Almost everyone in America ingests way more sugar than what we should.\u00a0\u00a0The amount is so much higher than what people ingested just a hundred years ago or what people had in the 19th century and before.\u00a0\u00a0Sugar used to be an expensive commodity, so people were a lot more careful about only using it to make treats on special occasions.\u00a0\u00a0Then, it became way too accessible so that the amount people consume today in just one day is many times over what people used to consume over a year's time.\u00a0\u00a0Sugar in all forms messes with the balance of the gut flora and it causes inflammation.\u00a0\u00a0It is the inflammation that is the main cause of nearly all chronic illnesses that plague modern society such as heart disease, arthritis, diabetes (yep, it's basically inflammation), and many other related illnesses.\u00a0\u00a0There is a reason why these diseases were less common in times past.So, balancing the gut flora and even eliminating grains and sugars is what Dr. Mercola suggests for most people.\u00a0\u00a0I find that eliminating the sugar is a lot easier than eliminating the grains, though, but I keep trying.",
