    "question": "Recently, my 10 year old daughter has been feeling ill immediately (if not while) after eating. She is hungry all of the time, but rarely finishes a meal now. We have started to pay a little more attention to see if her illness is food specific. As of now, it appears that she feels ill everytime she eats no matter what she has eaten. This is a child who could easily eat one of grandpa's famous hamburger, fries, potatoe salad, and fruit (she's growing like a weed) and now has trouble finishing a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.My husband has Type 1 diabetes and we are worried that this may be an early sign that her sugars are out of wack. I would like to know if there are any other possibilities so that I am a little more prepared when we take her to the doctor to see what may be causing this illness. Any thoughts?",
