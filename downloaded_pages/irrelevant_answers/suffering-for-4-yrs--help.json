            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!The symptoms all point towards either diabetes or hypothyroidism or hyper thyroidism. Were these tests run? Another possibility is Vitamin D deficiency. Anemia along with low blood pressure is another possibility.It could be an irritable bowel syndrome too resulting in various deficiencies.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "HiThanks for keeping me posted!An IBS can result in poor absorption of all the nutrients, Vitamin B, C, A, protein, carbohydrates and fats. Hence it can cause a lack of many nutrients in the body. Taking multi vitamin will help to an extent, however if the absorption is not proper, will fail to give maximum benefit. Please consult a gastroenterologist. Food allergies further add to the problem. Hence your doctor will need to take a comprehensive view of all the problems.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "For the past 4 years I have been suffering from fatigue, alopecia areata, digestion problems, body odor, weight loss and excessive sweating.\u00a0\u00a0Prior to this I was a relatively healthy individual, no-smoking, no-alcohol and relatively active.\u00a0\u00a0All of these symptoms suddenly began at the same time and progress together.\u00a0\u00a0During periods when I'm not feeling too tired, my hair grows back and I sweat less and have less body odor.\u00a0\u00a0However when I feeling extremely tired, it coincides with the hair loss and excess sweating and body odor.\u00a0\u00a0I feel that somehow all of these symptoms are linked.\u00a0\u00a0I've been to an endocrinologist and endocinologist and everything came back negative.\u00a0\u00a0My family doctor ran a few tests and they all came back negative.\u00a0\u00a0I have not had a diagnosis and have been suffering for 4 years.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated as this has greatly limited my quality of life and at times I am too fatigued to work.",
