    "question": "Lately, I've been having SUCH bad food aversions, it's not funny. It seems the ONLY thing I can even think about eating is junk food!!! I am craving everything bad, and cannot fathom eating anything healthy, I honestly start gagging even thinking about forcing myself to eat something I don't want to eat! I don't know what to do, I was never this bad before I was pregnant, or while I was pregnant for my first. Should I just force myself to eat it? I've never had this problem! :(",
