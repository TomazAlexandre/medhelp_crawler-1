Only testing by your doctor will verify if your glucose [blood sugar] levels are unstable. Right now its too soon to advise you which way to go. Post back to this thread with your test results if you test positive then we can help steer you in the right direction.",

    "question": "I wasn't sure about the topic but I have a question.\u00a0\u00a0For the last couple of years I have not liked sugar.\u00a0\u00a0It happened rather fast.\u00a0\u00a0I try not giving it to my kids or having it in the house.\u00a0\u00a0I used to drink a lot of soda, than it made me get jittery so I cut back to one glass a day.\u00a0\u00a0That's worked out for me for the last 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0Well within the last couple of weeks, everytime I had my 1 glass of soda, I've been really jittery again, worse than ever before.\u00a0\u00a0So I switched to caffiene free 2 weeks ago and I noticed I'm still just as jittery after I drink it.\u00a0\u00a0Than I got to thinking that it had to be the sugar in the soda.\u00a0\u00a0I never eat sweets or anything so I only noticed it through soda.\u00a0\u00a0Tomorrow I am not going to drink any soda and see if it still happens.\u00a0\u00a0When I say jittery, I mean internal and external shaking, not hyper.\u00a0\u00a0Is this a sign of diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0I am going to the doctor this week if possible.\u00a0\u00a0Also, today i had a piece of pie and it flared up again.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, Jessica",
