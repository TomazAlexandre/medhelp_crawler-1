            "answer": "I picked up on your comments made last year about high blood pressure, onset type II diabtes and low potassium levels. I have the same problem with energy, spiking blood sugar levels and spiking high blood pressure. I've intoduced lipoic acid for diabetes and L-Cystine, L-Proline and Vit C for high BP and niacin for cholestral levels. Has improved situation but still underlying problem of \"spiking\" of levels and apparent inability of drugs to really control things. I'm a little overweight but can't lose it etc. How did you get on with the specialsit you seemed to be seeing?",

            "answer": "If you google high blood pressure, low potassium, diabetes, a lot of new research comes back.Seems something called Conn's Disease may be the problem.High blood pressure results from a low potassium level, so does diabetes.I'm dealing with all this right now. Just recently been diagnosed with diabetes, but metformin made it worse, so just using insulin. I've been hospitalized because of the low potassium and the heart problems it engenders. Scary.I'm seeing a nephrologist next week, finally, to discuss these issues and be tested for Conn's.",

            "answer": "All the symptoms you describe can be caused by high blood sugar....especially the nausea and blurry vision.\u00a0\u00a0BTW, stress can also increase your blood sugar.Diarrhea, dehydration and using diuretics (like the Avalide) can cause low potassium.The uncontrolled diabetes (and stress) is probably causing your blood pressure to remain high.Why is your blood sugar out of control?\u00a0\u00a0Because when your blood sugar is over 200, you need more than Actos and Metformin to lower it.\u00a0\u00a0Actos and Metformin lower insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0In other words, they help your body respond better to the insulin it makes naturally.\u00a0\u00a0BUT they do NOT make your pancreas produce more insulin.\u00a0\u00a0And that's what you need.\u00a0\u00a0You need medication (like Glipizide or Gliburide) that will make your pancreas produce more insulin, which will lower the blood sugar.If you've had to take insulin in the past, that should be clear to your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Discuss it with your doctor.Best of luck to you.Co",

            "answer": "You do not want to increase insulin production. You want to decrease your blood sugar levels by decreasing your intake of foods that create a spike or rise in those levels. You have to realize your body does not respond to foods that increase your blood sugar as others do and consider yourself \"allergic\" to those foods, because they act as poisons in your system.Excess insulin in the body creates other serious problems, and shortens your life span. It causes weight gain by telling your brain you are hungry when you are not. It tells your liver to produce extra fat. It causes strokes and heart attacks by causing clots, raising triglycerides and lowering the good HDL cholesterol. Insulin promotes oxidation that converts the bad LDL cholesterol to oxidized LDL that forms plaques in arteries. High levels of insulin cause your kidneys to retain salt and raise blood pressure. The best ways to lower insulin are to avoid being overweight, restrict foods made with flour or added sugars, and eat fruits and root vegetables with other foods to keep blood sugar levels from rising too high.Do your homework on excess insulin, hyperinsulinemia, just Google it. Also, review this site, http://www.drmirkin.com/diabetes/D222.html. But there are many others.If you must take medicine, ask for one that lowers insulin and blood sugar. Insulin should be the last resort, but is often the first resource used by lazy and uninformed doctors. Diabetes is extremely complicated and is largely about self management. Do your homework. Google your symptoms and become aware of the available research. Diabetes does not have to beat you. You can beat it.Addressing the low potassium by increasing potassium intake and severely decreasing sugar producing foods will help correct many of your symptoms. It is best done under a doctor's care who is well informed about the complications of diabetes.You should ask to see an endocrinologist and look for a doctor that doesn't mind answering questions and welcomes patient participation in their health. You should also ask your doctor if there has been any damage done to your kidneys. If the answer is yes, ask what stage and request a referral to a neurologist.Remember, you are ultimately responsible for your health and you well being. It's your life to lose or to save. No one can suffer or die for you, not even your doctor. So you must become the expert. Doctors are only practicing medicine. They are not God, they do not have all the answers and they make mistakes. You must participate in your wellness by becoming informed and proactive",
