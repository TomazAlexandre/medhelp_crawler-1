            "answer": "Lyrica has been known to put weight on women -- it's one of the side effects.Lowering the dose will lose the effectiveness.Switching to an antiseizure med may help but may not. There are a few available.Lyrica is effective, as you've proven.

My appetite is through the roof which means I'm also struggling with my sugar levels. I usually have such control over my diet but in the last year I just cannot control my cravings. has anybody switched from lyrica to topazam and had success. With pain as well as less weight gain?",
