            "answer": "The symptoms that you describe are not related to depression.\u00a0\u00a0Although having said that, any symptom will be exacerbated when one suffers from anxiety and depression.Shame that you did not take up the offer of seeing an ENT consultant.\u00a0\u00a0Dizzy turns can sometimes stem from inner ear problems.\u00a0\u00a0Other reasons for dizzy turns, especially when you get up quickly is postural hypertension.And also from too low or too high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0Did the doctor check your blood pressure?Having numbness in your hands, arms and legs could be coming from problems along the spinal column.\u00a0\u00a0 Hands and arm problems could problems in the neck area.\u00a0\u00a0If you do a job that involves a lot of repetition, this could also be due to tendon or carpal tunnel problems.Leg problems are usually referred from the lower backNumbness can also be as a consequence of peripheral nerve damage which can happen due to injury or having diabetes.Your problem may also be due to low levels of Vitamin B12.\u00a0\u00a0A doctor can take a blood test to check your Vitamin B12 levels, it may be a good idea to check that you are not anaemic and also your Vitamin D levels.Let me know how you get on.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "I would ask your Dr. to do a blood draw for a CBC and also for an A1A. A lot of your symtoms reflect type 2 diabetes, especially the numbness in your arms/legs. As well as dizzyiness is a symptom. Do you have family history of diabetes? Ask for an A1A blood screen. I hope this helps!",

            "answer": "The inner ear controls the balance mechanism, so sometimes dizzy spells can be from that.\u00a0\u00a0Although your doctor cannot see a problem, it doesn't that you do not have an inner ear infection.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor can only see the outer ear, the middle ear and the ear drum.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter suffers this from time to time and is given medication from the doctor for this.The other conditions I mentioned in my previous post can also cause dizzy turns.The doctor should also send you for nerve conduction tests.\u00a0\u00a0This would indicate if there is any damage in the nerves or whether it is coming from pinched nerves due to arthritic changes in the body.Don't let the doctor fob you off by saying that this is all due to anxiety and depression.\u00a0\u00a0If you are have been taking antidepressant medications and this is still happening then you need further investigation.Let me know how you get on.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "your symptoms can't be cause by anxiety. maybe a panic attack could mimic some of your symptoms but if they are chronic they're obviously not anxiety-related.pre-syncope symptoms when standing up actually recalls \"Orthostatic hypotension\". neurological and vascular symptoms are often related. one triggered by the other.what for sure is related to anxiety is your elaboration of the symptoms. if you rationalized it , you would know perfectly that it's not something for the ER. and if they treated you like a hypochondriac they wouldn't be all wrong, even if your symptoms were real.moreover, sometimes ignorance is bliss: you know it COULD be something like MS so you tend to get ahead of yourself. in reality, you don't really know so stick with what you know!good luck",

    "question": "I am a 50 yr old female with a history of depression.about June 2013 I developed numbness in my arms hands and legs. I felt I could barely move but I continued to work my job and wait until I saw my psychiatrist whom I have had for over 20 yrs. He felt certain that it was an anxiety attack and prescribed xanax for 2 weeks. But the symptoms keep coming back. Especially since January 18 of this yr when I came down with the flu. Seems I can't shake it this time. I went to the weekend clinic in town in January who told me I probably had the stomach flu and a uti. I didn't have symptoms of a uti but was treated for it anyway. I have since been to my doctor 2 times with the dizziness and numbness. She said my ears looked fine but wanted to refer me to an ear specialist. I declined. I have never had trouble with my ears.\u00a0\u00a0Just lately with the dizziness and what feels like pressure.In desperation I have searched the internet for the numbness and dizziness which I know -leave it to the professionals right? I just want to be informed and not have a bunch of unneeded tests. I have insurance, but I also dont want to spend my retirement on the deductibles and crazy out of pocket costs. My symptoms mimic everything from ms to severe anxiety. At work today, I stood up from my chair and started to black out. I sat back down until it subsided. I really have felt terrible this past month. I have been tempted to go to the ER, but at my hospital,you seem to get treated like a hypocindraic or drug seeker and they really do not listen to what you tell them. I know, and I have also worked there for 13 years (acctg work-not patients) so-if you haven't fallen asleep yet from my long, long letter. Give me some clues please.thank youj~",
