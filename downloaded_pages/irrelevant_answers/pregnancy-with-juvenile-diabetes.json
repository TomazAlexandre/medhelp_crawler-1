            "answer": "I am a Type I diabetic and have two children.\u00a0\u00a0I had no problem getting pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I had one ob-gyn tell me that it could take up to two years(I am still not sure why he told me this.)\u00a0\u00a0I looked on-line, on a website that explained all about your cycle and helped me chart out when I\u00a0\u00a0was ovulating.\u00a0\u00a0I got pregnant quicker than my non-diabetic friends.\u00a0\u00a0So, I guess my point is you are doing the right things by keeping tight control of your blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Your health before you become pregnant is very important so that you can become pregnant and ensure that the baby won't have any problems the first few weeks of pregnancy our very important and you often don't know you are pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I was always pretty heathy, but I stepped it up a notch when we decided to start a family.\u00a0\u00a0I ate very well, exercised 5-6 times a week(still do-good habit to form!) and really tried to get enough sleep and drink enough water. During pregnancy keeping tight control can be a trying time-with changing insulin doses, as you grow in size so do your insulin needs.\u00a0\u00a0But it is well worth it--both my children were a good birth weight and are healthy.",

    "question": "I am in my early 20's and I have juvenile diabetes. I have kept my diabetes under control for a number of years now, I only have a problem with lows. Diabetes is my only problem; I have not/am not yet suffering with any other problems that may be diabetes-related. Even so, being insulin dependent, what are the chances of my becoming pregnant?",
