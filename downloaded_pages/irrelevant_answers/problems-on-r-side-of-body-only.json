            "answer": "Hi!If you also have urinary tract infection or suffered from it in recent past, then you could be suffering from to Reiter\u2019s syndrome or reactive arthritis, which includes a triad of arthritis, uveitis (the eye symptoms you have) and genitourinary infection. You can discuss this possibility with your ortho specialist. Also, get your urine tested and vaginal swab tested meanwhile.Blurred vision can be due to glaucoma, refractive errors (near or far sightedness), diabetes, retinal detachment, optic stroke, infection or injury to eye, migraines, floaters, brain tumors, temporal arteritis or due to bleeding into the eye. So consult an ophthalmologist as soon as you can. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I am a 39 y/o female who has been experiencing blurred vision but it's in my R eye only.....it comes on suddenly as leaves within a minute or two......I have no pain or discharge in that eye......I have noticed no halos or any problems with my vision before or after the blurry vision starts.I recently got DX'd with bursitis in my R hip and my R heel has been tingling & going numb. This too comes on suddenly and only lasts for a few minutes......It seems to me that something is going on with the R side of my body!!!
