            "answer": "Hello,For such burning sensations parasthesia skin should be ruled out. Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, spinal causes, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder.I hope it helps. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Hey, thanks for the information, i went to see a doctor and she said it could be something to do with my gastric system and prescribed me tablets which helped, the burning feelings went, i forgot to mention i think above about a pain that came with the burning feeling, down either side of my lower chest, that hasnt gone and is still causing me alot of uncomforate. Down the left side it's right below my rib cage and stretches slightly to my back, and on the right side its just below my ribs. its not constant, it comes and goes, but when it does come it causes alot of uncomfort. I could just be overreacting, i used to play alot of sport, about 6 times a week. then went to doing nothing but lazing about night and sleeping most of the day. Im returning to the doctors this tuesday so hopefully it will all get sorted :).",

    "question": "Hey, just wondering if aynoe has had a similar feeling to what i am currently going through.. recently i have been having weird burning sensations across my lower back area which then feels like it spreads upwards to my shoulders making me itch. this started about a week ago and feels like its progressivley getting worse, the itches dont last long and are usually gone before i even reach to itch them but they are constantly there, aswell as once this starts it seems to affect my chest area by tightening it up and restricting my breathing.. anyone have the same feelings?",
