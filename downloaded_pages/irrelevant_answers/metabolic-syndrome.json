            "answer": "Hi Shannie,Unlike the other MedHelp forums, no one here is a physician.\u00a0\u00a0We're all volunteers with consider personal experience as diabetics or caregivers.\u00a0\u00a0I can surely understand your feeling scared right now.\u00a0\u00a0A year is long time to not feel well.I don't know about Metabolic Syndrome, but found this reliable site from NIH for you:http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/metabolicsyndromex.htmlAs you get further evaluations, be sure to have your kidney function tested.\u00a0\u00a0If you are not urinating often and are retaining fluids, it would be wise to make sure your kidneys are doing their job and are not stressed.\u00a0\u00a0BP meds are often helpful to protect kidney functioning in diabetics; I'm not sure if this applies to folks without diabetes.The diet is interesting and the only insight I have as to \"fruit okay, juice not\" is that fruit contains fiber and takes a bit more digestion effort (a good thing).\u00a0\u00a0Juices are normally just pure fruit-sugar in liquid form.Many folks who are striving to lose weight try to avoid \"spending\" their calories on liquids which are less apt to give us a satisfied, full feeling like solid foods will.Wish I had more info to offer.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps others with experience will chime in and perhaps you'll discover others with your set of conditions in your area.\u00a0\u00a0It sure seems to help to have others to commiserate with as we struggle to gain control over what ails us.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and do your best to nurture yourself thru all this.",
