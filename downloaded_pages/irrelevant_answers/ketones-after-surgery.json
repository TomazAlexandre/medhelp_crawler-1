            "answer": "Dear Surfin'USA,I am not a medical professional, so any information I give you should be verified with your healthcare team.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for coming to us for answers.\u00a0\u00a0You pose some pretty tough questions.\u00a0\u00a0I will share with you what I have learned over the past 15 years about ketones as my daughter was diagnosed at the age of 21 months and we have had several episodes dealing with ketones (including oral surgery).It sounds like your blood sugars are within a good range considering you had surgery just yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0Ketones appear typically when blood sugars run high, but it is considered common for them to show up under times of high stress, such as surgery, also.\u00a0\u00a0Being in contact with your healthcare team to adjust your insulin doses during this time is very important.\u00a0\u00a0From what I have recently read, when stress occurs, our bodies prepare to take action.\u00a0\u00a0This preparation is referred to as the fight or flight response.\u00a0\u00a0In this period of stress, most hormone levels shoot up.\u00a0\u00a0Their main purpose is to make a lot of stored energy...glucose and fat...available to cells.\u00a0\u00a0The fight or flight response does not work well in people who have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin is not always able to let the extra energy into the cells, so glucose piles up in the blood.\u00a0\u00a0During your recovery from your recent surgery, you may be dealing with this scenario.\u00a0\u00a0You need to continue to keep an eye out for ketones, even when your blood sugar may not seem high to you.\u00a0\u00a0Stress hormones that are designed to deal with short term danger stay turned on for a long time after surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Ketones can show up even because you have not been eating for a period of time.\u00a0\u00a0So, I hope that I've provided you with some explanation for why ketones are hanging in there for you.\u00a0\u00a0Just make sure that you are getting some food into yourself, push fluids and keep checking your blood sugars and check for ketones frequently.\u00a0\u00a0My son had his wisdoms out last year and he lived on smoothies, frozen yogurt, mashed potatoes, soups and gatorade for about a week!I wish you a speedy recovery and take care of yourself.",

            "answer": "For ketones, as GG said, it's very important to drink a LOT of no-calorie fluids.\u00a0\u00a0Water is good.\u00a0\u00a0It's hard to drink \"too much\" water but it's easy to drink too little.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that by now, you are no longer showing ketones, but tuck away this info for the future -- whenever you have them.",

    "question": "I just had wisdom tooth surgery(yesterday), immeadietly after I got home(1 hr after surg.) I had some calorie fluids(juice) and some soup. It was 13 hrs since I'd last eaten,and I had moderate ketones before eating(during surgery,blood sugars were 100-153). Why is it easier for someone with diabetes to get ketones on normal blood sugars,and do thin people get ketones easier? Are starvation calories still dangerous? Since then,I have had trace-small ketones and blood sugars 140-200,can't seem to get rid of the ketones. Thanks for your help.",
