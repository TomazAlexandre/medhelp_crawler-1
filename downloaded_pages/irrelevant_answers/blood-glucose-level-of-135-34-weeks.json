            "answer": "i failed both, but i dont know what my numbers were for the first- but what they said they were slightly elevated. i would recommend doing it, the complication from gestational diabetes that isn't\u00a0\u00a0well controlled is a big baby which would be what im assuming\u00a0\u00a0your dr is concerned about with your attempt to do a vbac. the side effects you\u00a0\u00a0experienced are fairly\u00a0\u00a0normal and yes its not fun but if you have gd and don't monitor\u00a0\u00a0your sugars your baby could be bigger and then make your vbac a wash. where as if you do have it and control it the next few weeks you might still be able to go threw with a vaginal delivery. i dont really\u00a0\u00a0understand your reasoning for avoiding the test in the first place but i think it would be in yours and your babies best interest. so you have a healthy baby and a safe delivery whatever\u00a0\u00a0that ends up being.",

            "answer": "If you really want the vbac do the 3 hour test. Simple as that. If that was the ultimatum your doctor gave you to get you to do the one hour, they're not going to let you do the vbac if you refuse the 3 hour.It is entirely up to you if you do it or not, but you have to weigh your pros and cons.Good luck either way.",

            "answer": "I have gestational diabetes and met dietician and learned that if u do not control ur sugars then baby's pancreas has to do the work and when he/she is born their pancreas will be overworking and then cause him/her to have low blood sugar. They will then have to be hooked up to a sugar IV and will need to stay in nicu for a while. Also their kidneys may be affected as well. (Worse case scenario) also baby will be overweight. So suck it up buttercup and put ur baby ahead of ur own discomfort and do the test.",

            "answer": "My number was 144 after the 1 hour test. The cutoff at my Dr was 140. I had to do the 3 hour and found out I have gestational diabetes. My sister's number after the 1 hour was 138. They told her she was borderline but she did not need 3 hr and was not diagnosed with gd. That being said, it's best to heed your doctor's advice and get the 3 hr test. Gestational diabetes must be managed for optimal health of you and your baby. I was extremely nervous for the 3 hr test myself (hate needles and thought I would get sick) but I found it much easier than I had imagined. Have a snack ready for immediately after the test is completed. If you feel you absolutely cannot do the 3 hr test, the alternative would be to assume you have gd, meet with diabetes counselor and begin monitoring your sugars. I have been doing this for a month now and I feel so much better. My weight gain has stabilized and I have more energy. Good luck!!",

    "question": "I am due Feb 24 and have been avoiding the glucose test because of personal reasons. My doctor finall have me an ultimatum last week that if I wanted to do VBAC, I had to do the gestational diabetes screening. My one-hour level came back at 135 and now they want me to do the 3-hour test. I CANT!!! I was so sick, dizzy and weak from the 1-hour screening that I know I won't be able to do the 3-hour test. Anybody out there have a blood glucose level of 135 and actually have gestational diabetes? I've read that the acceptable number is below 140 but some doctors set the cutoff at 130. My doctor apparently sets the cutoff at 130... I had a VERY hard time with the 1-hour screening (sick, weak, dizzy) and am unwilling to do the 3-hour test. What do you guys think about the 135 level? How many women with 135 actually have gestational diabetes????",
