            "answer": "Hi,You need to review with your doctor and get a chest xray and preferably a blood test done.This could be blood from your nose, throat, teeth, or lungs and the exact cause and site needs to be identified. This could be secondary to minor trauma, infection, or in rare case cancer.Was it fresh blood? Was it mixed with mucus or sputum? Was there any associated cough? Do you have any dental problems? How much was it?What medications are you taking currently? Do you smoke? Is your blood sugar under control?Let us know what your doctor advises and keep us posted on how you are doing.Hope this helps.Regards.",

    "question": "I am a diabetic and for the past 2 days, I have coughed up blood. It's not a lot of blood, but it still worries me. The first day, I was at work and coughed up blood twice and I didn't think anything of it. It worried me a bit, but not too much. This morning I woke up and coughed up blood four different times and the first time was a bit much of the blood show. It's in my mucus whatever the reason for that. I haven't had a nose bleed or anything for quiet a while, so that rules that out I believe. Is there any relevance that me being a diabetic and knowing that it can make some of your organs fail easier than a nondiabetic could be making me do this? I am almost 24 years old and I was diagnosed with diabetes when I was 18 years old. Is it too soon for this stuff to be happening? What could be the true reason that I am coughing up blood? I need some help and I really hope that I can get some soon because I can't afford a visit to the doctor at the present moment. This diabetes has rained all of my money away since day one. I'm not poor, but I am fighting with everything I have to keep a job and get my supplies such as my insulin, test strips, and insulin pump supplies.",
