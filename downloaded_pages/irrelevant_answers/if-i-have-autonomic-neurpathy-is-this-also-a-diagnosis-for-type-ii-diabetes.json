            "answer": "It's a little hard to figure out exactly what you are asking. Waverider answered one question I thought I heard. If you are also asking if it is normal to have hypoglycemia for many years or did you have diabetes undiagnosed: Some people experience hypoglycemia for many years off and on before a diagnosis of diabetes. You may also have had diabetes for quite awhile and dismissed it as just hypoglycemia. If you have developed neuropathy that is probably the case. All you can do now is treat the neuropathy and control your blood sugar with a combination of weight loss, exercise, lowering carb intake and oral meds or insulin as prescribed by your doctor.",
