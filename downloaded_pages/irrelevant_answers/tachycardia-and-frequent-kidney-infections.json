            "answer": "Hi DanielleThanks for writing. Yes, you are right. After reading through your post carefully, I too feel that your symptoms are related. My opinion is based only on your post since there is no way I can do a clinical examination. The reason EKG etc could not catch the problem is because I think the cause for your symptoms lie in the kidneys. Maybe there is a stone or some kind of obstruction in the tract. Renal tubular acidosis due to these causes lowers the potassium in the blood. Diabetes too cannot be ruled out.\u201cLow Potassium Causes: 1) Kidney losses: Certain kidney disorders such as renal tubular acidosis (for example, chronic kidney failure and acute kidney failure),\u00a0\u00a02) Magnesium deficiency , 3) Leukemia, 4) Loss of potassium through stomach and intestines, Vomiting, Enemas or excessive laxative use , Diarrhea, After ileostomy operation, 5) Effect of medicines:\u00a0\u00a0Water pills (diuretics) , Medicines used for asthma or emphysema (beta-adrenergic agonist type of drugs such as bronchodilators, steroids, or theophylline),\u00a0\u00a0Aminoglycosides (a type of antibiotic used for treating certain serious infections)\u201dYou need to see a urologist and an Endocrine specialist for your problems.Hope this helps. If you need more help, please feel free to contact. I\u2019ll be happy to answer your queries. Please keep me posted.",

    "question": "I'm a 30 year old female. I'm a vegetarian, I don't consume caffine, I don't smoke, I rarely drink and I've given birth 3 times. 2 years ago I contracted the flu virus and obviously became ill. I noticed during the illness that my heart rate seemed to be rather high. I assumed once I got better that my heart rate would go back to normal but it didn't. I suffer transient attacks of tachycardia that my Doctors haven't been able to explain. I've had ekg's, an echo, done 24 hour and 30 halter monitors. All of which reported intermitent tachycardia but no other problems.Now, 2 years later, my heart rate stays up. My resting heart rate is normally anywhere from 102-108 but can spike up to 150 and higher with absolutely no reason. However, there are certain things that almost always provoke the episodes. They include: changing position from sitting to standing or laying to sitting. Heat, hot baths, showers or just hot weather always drives my heart rate way up. The episodes don't seem to be stress related at all, even though several doctors have suggested that am just suffering from anxiety disorder. Which they have treated me for and none of the meds have had the slightest effect on the symptoms.I'm also chronically dehydrated and often have low pottasium and blood sugar. I have low body temp and my body also has problems regulating my temp. I seem to go from one extreme temp to the other with no middle ground.In may I developed a kidney infection that took a month of antibiotics to get rid of. Since then I've had 4 more kidney infections.I'm frustrated and at my wits end. None of my doctors seem to be concerned with any of this, but I can't help but think that somehow my symptoms are related. Any help or suggestions would be very appreciated.ThanksDanielle",
