I would say that make sure you have proteins with sugars/carbs to keep you from spiking and bottoming out and see if that helps before you can get to see the doctor.",

    "question": "Hi, I have a Pituitary tumor and elevated Prolactin. Recently i found out i get hypoglycemic few hours after eating. I'm a carrier of a Hereditary Fructose Intolerance gene so i thought that was the cause of the low blood sugar. After cutting out all fructose from my diet i still get hypoglycemia. After ingesting pure glucose my sugar goes up and then drops low even faster after 2 hours. I don't think it's diabetes because my morning levels are usually fine, it seems to be reactive after eating. My question is, could my Pituitary have anything to do with this response somehow? I do have a blurry vision, but it's not constant, comes and goes. Thank you!",
