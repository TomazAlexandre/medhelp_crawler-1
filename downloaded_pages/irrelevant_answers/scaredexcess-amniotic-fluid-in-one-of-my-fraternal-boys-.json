    "question": "Hey ladies... I've been nervous all day and can't sleep because I had an appt with my specialist today, which I'm seeing due to the fact that I'm carrying twins and have had a miscarriage before, and when they did my ultrasound they found excess amniotic fluids in one of my baby's sac. Dr told me to not worry it could be that I have developed gestational diabetes although I just got checked 3 weeks ago and it came back normal. I googled polyhydramnios (excess fluid) and read how my baby could have swallowing issues or heart problems. Has anyone experienced this before? How was your lo? Oh and I'm 25 weeks and am going to be getting another glucose test done tomorrow as well as get seen every 2 weeks to monitor the babies.",
