            "answer": "Hello,Sexual problem or weakness is also known as erectile dysfunction. The causes are many like diabetes, depression, autonomic nervous system problem, excessive alcohol ingestion or tobacco smoking etc. Reduced sexual function and temporary infertility can also occur in males who take anabolic steroids but these side effects are temporary which go away after leaving anabolic steroids.You may need to consult your doctor to see which amongst these causes are responsible for your problem.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "So I'm 21 years old, healthy and active. This might not sound like such a big issue but the change has been drastic for me personally. For about a week now I haven't really been waking up with morning wood and when I do its extremely weak with no rigidity to it and it goes totally flaccid moments after I notice it. I want to compare that to just a few weeks ago where I would wake up with an erection that would literally keep me from going back to sleep. I'd get up, go **** and go back to bed and it would \"start\" to go down but very slowly. Also, my erections have been much weaker than normal. It feels more rubbery and bendable whereas before it felt like a steel pipe that wouldn't budge at all. On top of that it is much harder to maintain. I feel like I need constant stimulation by myself or it will go soft in a matter of seconds whereas before I could literally think about sex and pop a boner. Although, I was messing around with my girlfriend yesterday and had an erection the whole time, albeit a still a weaker version than before. I don't know if this is the problem or a symptom of something else but I've noticed that I've also been really tired/fatigued/brain fogged/lethargic throughout the day recently no matter how much sleep I get and I'm not really getting hungry (by that I mean I could eat but I don't really \"feel\" hungry). Anyway if anyone with any experience in the matter could help me it would be highly appreciated. This is honestly freaking me out as I look further and further into problems such as venous leaks and other injuries.",
