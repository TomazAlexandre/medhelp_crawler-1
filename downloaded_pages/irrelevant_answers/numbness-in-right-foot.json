            "answer": "Both Red_Star and Londres70 have provided excellent advice. There is a third possibility, though unlikely, and that involves vascular blockage. That is the bad news bears. You really need an in-person evaluation. Nerves deprived of nutrients, blood supply, or connection, sometimes atrophy and lose function. The window of opportunity to resolve such conditions without irreparable damage may be limited. These conditions cannot be evaluated within a home with the tools available to a visiting physician. As Londres70 suggested, you have to leave your home.",

    "question": "Hi..I have numbness in my right foot. It starts in the middle of and is number all the way to the right.\u00a0\u00a0:) Which means half my foot is numb but not totally numb. The bottom of my foot is not numb. The numbness goes about 1/3 up my calf. It started about 3 months ago. It is not worse but I am concerned and no I haven't been to the doc since I have this stupid Agoraphobia.I remember the day it came. It came all at once. I just thought since my back was hurting from sleeping on a bad mattress that it must be a pinched nerve in my back. I am not a hypochondriac. If I were I would to the doctor all the time which I do NOT.I thought it could be MS or Parkinson's. But I don't know. I think there is such a thing call \"Numb Foot\". Has anyone ever heard of it and can anyone tell what may be causing this. Thank you",
