            "answer": "Hi!Yes, you can get your testosterone levels checked. Extreme fatigue could be due to low testosterone in males, anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems. Another possibility is sleep disturbances (like sleep apnea, imbalance of rapid eye and non rapid eye movement sleep etc.). You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, low Vit B12 (maybe you need further supplementation), low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium. Hyperthyroidism too causes increased sweating and tiredness.\u00a0\u00a0 Postviral fatigue syndrome is another possibility. Persisting EBV infection or mono can also be the cause. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Have had every test run on me I am 38. Symptoms are an Off feeling. Vision issues like blurry and ghost images. Seen Opthomologist gave me glasses when I wear them I feel even more off. When I squeeze things I shake even when I lift them. No weakness I feel very strong. Had MRI/MRA all normal B12 test Vit d test was low but normal now. Still have symptoms.. I havent had testorone checked could this be what is causing these issues or something more..I do suffer from anxiety but these symptoms seem to be driven on how I feel which makes me worry all the time have tried different meds but none have eased the symptoms I have. I had foot surgery in sept 2011 and havent felt good since and thats when my vision issues started after I woke up.. Thanks for any input..",
