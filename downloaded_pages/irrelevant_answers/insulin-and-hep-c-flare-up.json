Getting rid of HCV can have an effect on insulin resistence.\u00a0\u00a0However, insulin resistence can be a factor of difficulty in getting rid of HCV.\u00a0\u00a0Having had HCV for 25 years maybe it's time to begin to looking into resolving\u00a0\u00a0it.\u00a0\u00a0With a recent A1C of 10.7 I don't think you can claim 'control' quite yet.

            "answer": "I can not say for sure if insulin injections could cause these symptoms. It is uncommon for insulin to cause problems that you describe.Your symptoms are very serious and disturbing. Is your urine dark? Does your skin itch? Do the whites of your eyes look yellow? Clay-colored stool can point to serious liver damage. If the liver can not remove bilirubin from the blood and produce bile, stool becomes \"whitish\". Nausea and vomiting can also indicate that your liver doesn't work well.Considering your long history of hepatitis C, you need to see the doctor soon, check these symptoms out, and get labs and some imaging tests done. Do not put this off. See a good physician.",
