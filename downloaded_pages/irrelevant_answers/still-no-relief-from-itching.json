            "answer": "Hello,I see that you are having the problem of chronic urticaria.It is defined as urticaria that persists for longer than 6 weeks. In most of the cases of chronic urticaria, the underlying pathology is idiopathic i.e it is not linked to any cause. It is essential to rule out the presence of serious illnesses of which recurring hives can be a symptom. Examples are hepatitis, hyperthyroidism, lymphomas, collagen vascular diseases, and cancers of the rectum, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. Chronic urticaria is often accompanied by coexistent physical urticaria, triggered by environmental exposure to heat, cold, sunlight, vibration, pressure on the skin or even exerciseI feel that you should find out the cause of your chronic urticaria by ruling out the various conditions causing it.Pls consult an allergist for that.I hope that helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing and if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",

    "question": "This past winter i was suffering from hives. I didnt get the hives in the traditional sense (rash or inflammation) but i would get these intense \"itch attacks\" after a rise in body temperature. Usually after i would get nervous, stressed, excited or exercise. Usually i would break a sweat and it would go away. Now as of the last 3 months the itching got much worse because it is now a 24/7 itch. It got this bad after a stressful 2 weeks back in february and now it wont go away. I can no longer sweat normally. I have already been to the doctor several times. I had many blood tests done and they all came back normal (thyroid,liver,blood count, diabetes, iron, HIV). The stressful event is what made it worse but i no longer feel stress so it is definitely something else. Atarax didnt work much. I need help. Should i go see an allergist and/or dermatologist?",
