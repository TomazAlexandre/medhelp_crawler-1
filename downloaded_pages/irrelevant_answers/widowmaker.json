            "answer": "It sounds as if he needs bypass surgery, not stenting. Why is he not being offered this option? The survival rate at a top notch facility is probably low (1-2%) at 1 year following bypass surgery, but much lower if he does not undergo the procedure. It CABG is not an option then he can be considered for a high risk intervention at a tertiary care facility, but this probably has worse outcomes at years 3-5 than bypass surgery.",

    "question": "My dad is 55 and has high blood pressure since in his 20's, he now has depression and diabetes, he has been having some chest pains he went to the Dr. and they told him he has 6 blocked arterys 90% 80% 70% and the others were 40% but the 90% is in the widowmaker. They said they can not but a stent in any of them because of where they are at. All the can do is give him meds to thin the blood and break up the blockage. His heart is not damaged and they said his heart muscles are good. So what is the survival rate. And long on a medical stand put can he survive just taking meds.",
