            "answer": "If blood sugar levels are too high or too low, a person will not feel as energetic as when they are normal. If too low, the brain's distress may cause loss of sex drive as the brain struggles to fuel itself with whatever emergency glucose it can find. This should be only temporary if blood sugar levels are the cause. However, in males, possible nerve damage from the disease can cause more long-term problems. Please discuss this with your endocrinologist.",

            "answer": "I was just diagnosed with this disease a little over two years ago. When I was first treated with insulin for the first two months, my libido sky rocketed. Now it has been two years and my sex drive comes in little spirts and then dies as soon as it comes. I am in my twenties and I go to the gym 5-6 days a week (somewhat in the hopes that my sex drive will return if I am healthy enough). It upsets me to no and all my endo suggested was to use cialis. I feel this is a mask to the problem and I don't see a permanent solution in sight. I don't want any relationships because I just wouldn't know how to break it to my partner. It's tearing me up inside and it's all I worry about.",
