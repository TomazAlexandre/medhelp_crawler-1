            "answer": "Type one Diabetes is an auto-immune disease.Your Thyroid disease is very likely also an auto-immune disease.A TSH of 77 is very high, but not life threatening. It certainly calls for treatment, though. My TSH has been as high as 120, and I have read of higher test results than that.You should have the following tests run;free T3free T4Thyroid antibodiesWith those test results and your TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) results, your Endo will be able to make a diagnosis and put you on a dosage of Synthroid or a similar drug to start bringing your TSH down and your other thyroid hormones back into balance.It will be a slow process and you probably won't see any relief in your symptoms for a month or two.Sorry you are going through this. The two diseases are not related, but a person who has an auto-immune disease is prone to developing other auto-immune diseases, so in a way they are related. your Diabetes did not cause the Thyroid problem, but it opened the door for it and possibly others as well.I hope all goes well for you and you get a good Endo who can get things back on an even keel for you.Best of luck.",

            "answer": "I would also ask for an ultrasound of the thyroid gland. It is cheap, fast, painless, and will tell your Endo a lot about the condition of the gland itself.Might want to make notes to take with you. ;)",

            "answer": "AR-10,Thanks so much for the information about the tests! I'm supposed to go in for the free T4 test tomorrow and they did not mention any others, so I will be sure to ask about the free T3 and Thyroid antibodies tests and the ultrasound. I definitely agree with you that it is best to get as much information as possible, and also to get it as *soon* as possible.And I really appreciated the comments about the TSH result numbers too -- friends at work laughed at me tonight when I asked told them about my test and asked if anyone knew anything about thyroid conditions. One person \"explained\" to me that since 0.3 - 5.0 was the normal range, I had obviously gotten the number wrong because I could not possibly have gotten a result of 77. I think insult to injury is not only getting some upsetting info about your health, but having people tell you you're exaggerating when you try to explain it to them.\u00a0\u00a0(When I learned my MRI scan showed that a severely herniated disk was the cause of two years' excruciating pain, people said that I must have misheard the doctor on the phone because if I really had a herniated disk I would be in unbearable pain!) Your rapid response at least validated that my ears are working! ;)So thanks again! I am going to print out all this information and bring it with me tomorrow. I hope your own struggle with the hypo-hyper-hypo-hyper is is resolved soon with the best possible results!Gratitude and best wishes,Gil",

    "question": "I am a 39 year old type 1 insulin-dependent diabetic and have been having trouble controlling my blood sugar. At my last checkup, I asked my doctor for a referral to an endocrinologist because I would like to start using an insulin pump. During that checkup, my doctor had blood drawn (which I thought was for my usual HC1 check) and ordered a \"thyroid stimulating hormone\" test. I didn't even know they had done this test, but I found out today that the result was a 77, so I am going in for another test for hypothyroidism (I think it's called the free T 4 test?) tomorrow. I have been looking for information online since I got this news. The symptoms I have read about seem to match things I have been going through -- fatigue, depression, abnormal menstrual cycle, dry skin, weight gain, etc.-- so the test result seems to makes sense, but I have not been able to find any information about the particular number of my test result, the \"77\". The receptionist who gave me the information said that a normal healthy result would be between 0.28 and 5.0, and the highest she has ever seen has been between 8 and 9. She said that the 77 was shocking, and this is very disturbing to me. Can you tell me what this result might mean? There is no scale that I can find online that would suggest anything. The only figures I can find tell me that a result higher than 4 is reason for concern.I am also wondering if hypothyroidism can be related to diabetes.Any information would be greatly appreciated.Thanks,Gil",
