    "question": "My baby camps under my right rib and doesn't move. I'm 32 weeks with gestational diabetes and my baby is measuring big so I know he's cramped in there. But my rib hurts so bad that I can't even move. It hurts to even talk. I know this just comes with being pregnant, but is there anything anyone has tried that helps?? Do doctors just tell you to suck it up? Please help.",
