This is usually associated with an underlying chronic illness such as diabetes ( have you been assessed along this line?).I suggest you push through with your physician consultation in case your medications may need to be changed or modified. An assessment of an underlying systemic disease like diabetes may also be needed.",

    "question": "Have any of you heard of getting yeast infection on your breast? I have a horrible itchy breast and have been using lotrimin cream on it for a week. It isn't better and is starting to spread to the other breast. I just got another kind of antifungal cream and I was told to see a doc. monday if not better. I don't have insurance so am reluctant to do that. Maybe somebody has a cure they have used. I have scratched till it is all red and has little liquid bubbles!\u00a0\u00a0In misery!!!",
