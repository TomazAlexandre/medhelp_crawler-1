            "answer": "Hi!To treat a plexopathy (involvement of blood vessels, nerves and lymphatic channels), it is important to find the cause. Most important causes of lumbo-sacral plexopathy are diabetes and other metabolic disorders, collagen vascular disorders, infection, trauma, nerve entrapment, cancer and autoimmune disorders. Hence you need complete investigations regarding these. Treating the cause reduces the symptoms considerably. Also, pain killers, muscle relaxers and rest are the other treatment modalities followed. In some cases like nerve entrapment, physiotherapy is the main stay of treatment. Please discuss this with your specialist. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
