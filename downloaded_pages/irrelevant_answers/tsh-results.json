    "question": "Hi all,I got my TSH results- 7.3. GP didn't even seem majorly concerned, said we will monitor it by retesting in 3 months. they are testing my antibodies for potential hashimoto's but she said if it was negative they wouldn't medicate me for a tsh of 7.3. I just wondered if people could share their expereinces- i ahve had symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness, joint pain, very fine constant shaking of hands, mild numbness on left side of body (legs, arms, neck), nausea, occasional muscle twitches, feeling of a \"lump\" in my throat on left side when i press on it, irregular periods, increased bowel movements, the feeling of urinary urgency like you would get in cysitis (no infection).I already have had contact with a member who told me 7.3 tsh is not normal but do people think I have a case to recieve medication at this level? Have other people had levels similar to this and experienced bad symptoms? To be honest, I hope it is my thyroid as for months i've been convinced I have MS.",
