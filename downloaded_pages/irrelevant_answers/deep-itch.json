They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms are gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult your doctor to get it evaluated.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided.
