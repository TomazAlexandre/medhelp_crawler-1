    "question": "I drink a ridiculous amount of water all day everyday. Outside of 2-3 glasses of milk and a glass of orange juice with my breakfast, it is all I drink all day long.. but it seems that at night, my thirst becomes unquenchable!\u00a0\u00a0Which ***** for the whole getting up to pee a million times a night thing.. i understand that we tend to fall back on our hydration during hours that we are asleep.. for obvious reasons.. so i take a few sips whenever I get up to pee just to wet my whistle.. but seriously, I have to show some major restraint or I would never sleep! Every time I feel like I could chug a gallon of ice water.. does this happen to anyone else at night?",
