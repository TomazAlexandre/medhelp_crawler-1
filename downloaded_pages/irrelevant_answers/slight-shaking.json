            "answer": "Hi!If you were my patient, I would advise you that low blood sugar was probably the reason for your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0It is fairly common during pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0One thing you can do is avoid high sugar foods ( such as sugar cereals, etc) or combine them with some fat such as cheese or peanut butter.\u00a0\u00a0You can also keep something on hand to snack on such as Cheerios or Goldfish crackers.\u00a0\u00a0Milk is good to bring the sugar back up when it has dropped too low.\u00a0\u00a0If this happens frequently, or if you are at high risk for diabetes, you might want to mention it to your doctor as you might need to be tested for diabetes.Good luck!Dr B",
