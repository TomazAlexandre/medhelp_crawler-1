            "answer": "hmmm! well i am not sure if extremely hungry or extremely tired has anything to do with diabetes or not. I cannot believe your ex husband does not care about your sons health. He should get that checked out as soon as possible.Is he into sports? or maybe get him to join some after school activities and try to maintain a healthy lifestyle. You are the MOM and you should have a say so in what is good for your son. Don't listen to your ex. Step in and take charge. Maybe he is still depressed over the divorce. (your son that is) I don't know that is just my 2 cents worth.",

            "answer": "I might think depression too. To aid or at least ease you mind on the diabetes issue, try a diabetic diet. Low in sugar and the like. You can find diet menus and guide lines all over the web. If nothing else its just a healthy life shift even if you don't see results. With all the eating is there weight gain or influx? A glandular issue instead? I am divorced with a young son my self. Even though his insurance is threw dad I can still make appointments and take him where he needs to go. If insurance is an issue ad him to your or get a supplement insurance to pick up the slack. I don't know how your custody is set up but mine is joint, 50/50.",

            "answer": "There certainly is a chance for depression but, I would like to know his height & weight. His signs & symptoms could be pointing to hyperglycemia (elevated blood sugar). The fact that he is tired, hungry, and inactive does go along with diabetic issues. Although there may be plenty of sugar in his blood, he may not have enough of the hormone (insulin) to unlock the cell door to metabolize the sugar. This would make him feel hungry! If his blood sugar is elevated (normal range 80-120), it can be harming his body. His Father really needs to understand this so he can be checked as soon as possible.",

            "answer": "You have a situation that could be characterized as child abuse and grounds for intervention by child protective services. Your ex-husband is acting in an irrational, unlawful and unconscionable manner. You are in a difficult and unenviable position.I am not going to suggest that you go to the authorities, however, after seven years, it is clear that your son requires a complete medical examination. As part of a divorce a judge is usually appointed to insuren the welfare of the children.A \"motion\" before the judge will do the trick. A \"motion\" is a simple one line request for the judge to order something. You will be making a motion for the court to (1) order your former husband to bring your child to a facility for a complete physicial, and report back to the court and (2) provide you with a copy of the findings.Sunch motions are routinely granted.Another course of action is to threaten your \"ex\" to make such a motion within 30 days if your husband does not provide for a medical evaluation.You have my sympathies.",
