            "answer": "Well I have gestational diabetes so it's best for me to eat every 2-3, no longer than 3 (if I can help it). I eat my 3 main meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) with snacks in between. I, personally, think as long as not every meal is a full course dinner and you are eating snacks (i.e. fruit or granola bars) then I don't see the problem, but that's just my opinion. Have you mentioned it to you doctor and see what they say?",
