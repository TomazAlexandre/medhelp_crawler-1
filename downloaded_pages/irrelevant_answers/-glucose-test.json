Turns out I have gestational diabetes (readings were slightly elevated) where I now have to monitor (prick and test) my blood glucose everyday until baby arrives. ***** because it makes me stress about eating anything carbohydrate. My baby somehow was on track but I since being on this new diet baby measured 3 days smaller than supposed to. I'm not sure if it is related but I know I feel stressed when the readings are not what I'm expecting inspite of following a relatively sugarless diet anyway prior to the test. Sorry, had to vent lol!",
