She would love a hot water bottle in her kitty bed I know my rescue cat loved it when he was sick. Thanks for all the advice!",

We do have to give her baths every so often because at her age she isn't cleaning herself very good.\u00a0\u00a0The last two times I've given her a bath the bath water turns red from something in her fur it isnt from her urine or any kind or sore. I haven't a clue what it could\u00a0\u00a0be IT LOOKS LIKE BLOOD!!!",
