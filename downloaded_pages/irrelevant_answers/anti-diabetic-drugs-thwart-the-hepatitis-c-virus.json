    "question": "By analyzing the role of the AMP kinase enzyme in Hepatitis C viral proliferation, University of Leeds researchers have discovered that certain traditional diabetes drugs prevent Hepatitis C viral replication.New Use for Old Drugs in Treating Hepatitis C?August 5, 2010Research led by the University of Leeds has found drugs such as anti-diabetic drug Metformin and AICAR, used to combat obesity, can prevent the hepatitis C virus from replicating in the body. Hepatitis C virus affects an estimated three per cent of the world's population and there are four million carriers of the virus in Europe alone. The virus affects the liver and recovery rates are low: only around 40 % of hepatitis C sufferers will fully recover, with others developing cirrhosis and in many cases, liver cancer.\"We're very excited about these findings,\" said Professor Mark Harris from the University's Faculty of Biological Sciences. \"These drugs are already on the market, and whilst substantial clinical trials still need to take place before they can be used to treat hepatitis C infection, we think it could be an enormous step forward in the battle against the virus.\"Continue reading this entire article:http://www.labmate-online.com/news/news-and-views/5/news/new_use_for_old_drugs_in_treating_hepatitis_c/11108/",
