            "answer": "I would first ask if you are taking any new medications? This happened to me not long ago with a prescription for metformin, a diabetes medicine I was prescribed in a fairly high dose. I actually had to cut down on it before that smell was gone...but mine was not ammonia.\u00a0\u00a0i can't really put my finger on what it smelled like but I didn't like it.If you are not on any new meds you might need to pay a visit to an ear, nose and throat Dr. to get to the bottom of it.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

            "answer": "My son gets this at times. I can smell it on his breath when it happens. It's like nail polish remover- acetic acid. I think in my son's case it's due to faulty carbohydrate digestion, due to his hormone imbalances.His doctors have never tried to answer my questions about this, but I found an article that describes ketotic hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis in children with secondary adrenal insufficiency, growth hormone and ACTH deficiency, and pituitary hypothyroidism. That's my boy!The problem stopped for several months, but has returned since he started growth hormone injections, which affect blood glucose and metabolism.Excess ammonia can be caused by blocked metabolic pathways, deficiencies of B vitamins and amino acids, and infections. Sorry, I don't have more info I can remember at the moment. I read quite a bit about this three years ago.",
