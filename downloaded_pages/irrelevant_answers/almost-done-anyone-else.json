But either way, i cant wait to meet my little bundle. Hes going to be perfect. This pregnancy has been far from easy. Hyperthyroidism, blood clotting disorder that needed blood thinner, gestational diabetes.. But he has gone through it all with flying colors. And i never had nausea, swelling, or bleeding. So i cant really complain. I am going to have a perfect little boy soon. :-) good luck to all you mamas. :-)",
