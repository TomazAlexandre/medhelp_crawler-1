            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0If your infection is recurrent even after repeated incision and drainage, a repeat wide excision of the infected area may help, short of doing mastectomy.\u00a0\u00a0Have they made a culture of the infecting organism? If your doctors haven't done this, then it should be done so that antibiotic treatment can be focused on the offending organism.\u00a0\u00a0Another thing to think about:\u00a0\u00a0it is possible that your infection keeps coming back because you have some other systemic illness which adversely affects your immune system, such as diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0In this case, the systemic illness has to be controlled before the infection will heal properly.",

            "answer": "Thanks Dean.\u00a0\u00a0They have cultured and the bacteria is anaerobic.\u00a0\u00a0I do have type 2 diabetes diagnosed one year ago,\u00a0\u00a0and ulcerative colitis for about five years.\u00a0\u00a0The problem is that I am in a bad circle because as soon as the infection shows itself the antibiotics seem to make my UC flare and they have given me remicade treatments for this and it works for awhile but back to the infection and treatment then sick with UC.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes has been under control with medication.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your thoughts.",

    "question": "I am just wondering if anyone has ever heard of a Mastectomy to resolve a recurrent breast abscess?\u00a0\u00a0In December of 2005 I had a growth in a breast duct.\u00a0\u00a0The surgeon removed the duct and some tissue around it, he called it a benign papilloma.\u00a0\u00a0The first infection came about 2months after the original surgery and it has continued for almost two years.\u00a0\u00a0I have had about twelve procedures to open the wound or needle aspriration and two additional surgeries in the OR where they took more tissue and left the incision open to heal from the inside out.\u00a0\u00a0Recently my surgeon sent me to an infectious disease doctor to see if he could do anything else for me.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on many antibiotics over the last two years, sometimes for ten days, and sometimes for a month at a time.\u00a0\u00a0It never fails as soon as it \"heals up\" it fills with infection and has to be opened or forces itself open.\u00a0\u00a0Back to the infectious disease doctor he told me that he can't do anything else for me and recommended that I meet with a general surgeon and a plastic surgeon for a partial or full mastectomy.\u00a0\u00a0I have a list of questions and an appt on the day after Thanksgiving.\u00a0\u00a0 I have also been having mammograms every six months because of some white area on my mammogram of the other breast, they just tell me they want to watch this area. This may not be an appropriate question for this forum, but I am getting nowhere with my research attempts on this issue.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for reading my question.",
