            "answer": "MS is something that needs to be considered by the sound of your MRI report, but certainly there could be other explanations. We are always careful in making the diagnosis of MS as it can carry quite serious implications in terms of patient lifestyle and medical management.So think about things like this: do you have stroke risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, heart disease? Do you have a clotting disorder or take birth control pills? If so, then this could represent a stroke. The MRI report says right hemisphere which depending on the exact location could explain the left leg weakness. You may also need to get a carotid ultrasound or an MRI of the arteries in your head and neck to see if you have clogged arteries on the\u00a0\u00a0right that would be causing these tiny lesions.I'm not sure if this is at all related to your prior head injury. Without seeing you or the actual MRI, I can only guess that it probably isn't. (Again, it's only a guess)If your doc does think it's MS, then the next step would be a spinal tap with special immune studies. There are also less common diseases that can cause white matter lesions such as sarcoids and infection.\u00a0\u00a0But I will let your neurologist look at the films, examine you properly, and make the final call. Best of luck.",

    "question": "Dear Doctor,I am a 45 year-old female, generally in excellent health. Recently, during a routine physical with my PCP, I mentioned to him that I had noticed an occasional weak feeling in my left leg.\u00a0\u00a0Not constantly, but for instance when I'm tired.\u00a0\u00a0In speaking with him about it, I also remembered an instance about 4 years ago, when my left leg suddenly went out on me and I fell. It wasn't a major occurrence, so I forgot about it. Except for the occasional weak feeling in my leg, I have had no other symptoms. He immediately said it could be MS and sent me for a brain MRI.\u00a0\u00a0Here are the results:\"The FLAIR and T2 weighted sequences show a few small areas of high signal in periventricular and subcortical white matter.\u00a0\u00a0This predominantly involves the right hemisphere.\u00a0\u00a0There is no mass effect, and there is no abnormal contrast enhancement.\u00a0\u00a0The ventricular system is normal.\u00a0\u00a0Conclusion: Small foci of abnormal signal in white matter.\u00a0\u00a0In a patient of this age, this raises the possibility of demyelinating disease. Other possibilities include previous brain injury or white matter ischemic disease.\"My question is, could this result be from a head injury many years ago when I hit my head in a car crash?\u00a0\u00a0Could it have been a small stroke?\u00a0\u00a0Why is my PCP so quick to say that it's MS?\u00a0\u00a0I can't see a neurologist for another month and I'd greatly appreciate you opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much!",
