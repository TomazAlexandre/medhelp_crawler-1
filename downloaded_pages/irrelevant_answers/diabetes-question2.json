            "answer": "I found this @http://www.calorie-count.com/forums/post/45031.htmlI separated the sentences where she talks about her period stopping...#2 missa97321 Jul 09 2007 21:54I was diagnosed PCOS and insulin resistance about 5 years ago. I put on a lot of weight and have struggled for the last 5 years to get it off. So far things seem to be going ok. Very slow but ok. I have to keep a very close eye on my carb intake. I know that I have had to much because my head feels like it is stuck in the clouds. I can't think straight or concentrate on anything. I love bread too so it is hard. Trying to find a balance of low carb, high protien and low cal. I have lost 3 pounds since starting on June 4th. I have noticed that protein the fiber really help keep things in check, keep me full for longer and help curb the carb cravings. I have changed to all whole wheat, brown rice and restrict un natural sugar.I also stopped having my period and my doctor put my on birth controll for no other reason but to regulate my period.I have since went of them because I don't need them and for the last year my periods have been pretty regular. In the last year I have also been watching my diet pretty close so I don't know if that has anything to do with it. It is very frustrating. I eat good and excercies and I am still fat. Being here and counting the calories and seeing all the stats in writing has really helped me over the last month. I can actually imagine getting to my goal some day :)",

            "answer": "Type 1 diabetes is not the same as type 2, which is what is really associated with insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0Type 1 is lack of insulin, not your body not knowing how to use it which is what type 2 or insulin resistance is.\u00a0\u00a0You should be seeing an endocrynologist on a routine basis to regulate your sugar levels and then you can work on your cycles, but getting your sugar straightened out is the first step and is much more important for your overall health than for just your cycles - kidney failure, vision failure, blood pressure, heart issues......much more serious than just menstrual cycles.Good luck and please see a doctor for this if you are not and if you are, then you should be seeing him more often if your sugar levels are constantly high",
