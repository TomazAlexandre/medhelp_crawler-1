            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Tremors or rocking sensations are often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, poor sleep patterns, stress and fatigue. You smoke and must be doing this quite a lot to produce such symptoms. Along with this you may be having either stress or a sleep problem.They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. Certain epilepsies too could be the cause. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Needless to say, you should give up smoking.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
