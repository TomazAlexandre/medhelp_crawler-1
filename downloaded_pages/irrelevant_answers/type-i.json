            "answer": "I too am a volunteer.\u00a0\u00a0I have had Type I diabetes for 25 years.\u00a0\u00a0First off, you should give yourself credit-you sound like you are taking the right steps with doctors and the testing your daughter is getting and will be getting soon.I had Graves disease and was allergic to the medications, so I had to have my thyroid removed.\u00a0\u00a0The thyroid is part of the autoimmune system as well, which it sounds as if you already know that, by the tests your daughter gets.I have had ganglion cysts and clicking in my fingers as well as joint soreness and pain in my hands.\u00a0\u00a0My mother has arthritis and my grandmother had it.\u00a0\u00a0Does arthritis run in your family?I was told by my hand surgeon that he has seen many diabetics with the same problems as me.\u00a0\u00a0I guess what I am trying to say is he didn't have proven tests, but theories that diabetes and hand or joint pain could be connected.I am also doing some research on lupus and arthritis. I went to the Arthritis Foundation website and the Lupus Foundation site. It sounds as if there is some correlation between these diseases and diabetes, because they are all autoimmune diseases\u00a0\u00a0but again I am only researching and am no doctor.",

            "answer": "With the rapid weight loss and the very significant joint pain, coupled with the reflux and stomach issues, I would suspect Crohn's disease even more than celiac disease. But the scope should give you a much better idea of what's going on. Hope she feels better soon.",

Crohn's was just a thought -- it can be a sneaky beast, and no one has all the symptoms that are listed -- but only someone who sees your daughter in person will be able to make a diagnosis among all the possibilities. Best of luck on Friday.",

            "answer": "crazedmom -I have had type one for 30 years, I am 31 years old and when I was around your daughter's age, I too had SEVER joint pain...especially in the knees!I usually treated it with ice packs or advil.\u00a0\u00a0I was tested fpr Lyme disease as well, has your daughter been tested for that?I ended up not having it, I just treated it as it came.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors couldn't diagnose me with anything, I still get pain to this day, but not as much.One thing to be careful with is taking Advil, I love it but, taking too much on a daily basis is not good for the kidneys...please be careful.But I know when you are in that much pain, you will do just about anything to stop it, especially for your child.As for the stomach pain, have you ever checked your daughter's ketone levels?\u00a0\u00a0When ketone levels are high, stomach aches can occur. Ketone test sticks can be purchased at your local drug store and can be tested by dipping the stick in urine, please excuse me if you are aware of this already.Do you happen to keep a daily log of her glucose levels? If not, you may find it helpful because 7 shots a day sounds like it's just too much...although I am not a doctor. What type of insulin is she on and how much does she take in the course of a day?I wish for the best on her appt to the specialist. I look forward to your reply if you have the time.\u00a0\u00a0All the best!",

    "question": "I have a 15 year old daughter that was diagnosed almost 3 years ago with Type I.\u00a0\u00a0She is on an average of 7 shots a day.\u00a0\u00a0She was having a problem during the past year with chronic stomach pain.\u00a0\u00a0A doctor had put her on prevacid which seemed to help.\u00a0\u00a0We moved to another state and she went of the medicine a while.\u00a0\u00a0However, about a month ago she was complaining constantly that the pain was back so we took her to a specialist who put her on a stomach medicine because of a lot of acid production.\u00a0\u00a0She is suppose to go in for\u00a0\u00a0a scope the 27th of next month.\u00a0\u00a0Trying to wait for school to get out.\u00a0\u00a0She also has started complaining a lot about pain in her knees, elbows and now hands.\u00a0\u00a0She has woke up during the night in tears from the pain.\u00a0\u00a0On several occassions now she has gotten very weak in the knees and almost fell.\u00a0\u00a0She has seen her pediatician who is sending her to a rheumatory arthritis doctor for evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0Now I am so worried.\u00a0\u00a0I know that this is an auto immune disease and am scared that she may have this also.\u00a0\u00a0She now has a goiter and her thyroid is tested bi yearly and so far ok.\u00a0\u00a0My question is how common is arthritis with diabetics?\u00a0\u00a0Also, what are the chances of this being lupus since that is an auto immune disease as well.\u00a0\u00a0She has issues with being tired all the time, hair loss, she does get the rash on her face but her pediatrician said that this could be from the arthritis and she has lost 8 pounds since her last visit to the doctors a little over a month ago.\u00a0\u00a0Any info would get greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Her appt with the specialist is the 30th.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
