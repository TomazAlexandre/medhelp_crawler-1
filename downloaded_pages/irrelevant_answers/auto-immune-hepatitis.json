Most of the people on this forum have hep c, but I've seen some posts by folks who have your variety as well as hcvv, though I don't know if they're currently using the forum.\u00a0\u00a0I have a form of scleroderma, and there have been some folks with lupus, thyroid burnout, as well as a lot of diabetes and psoriasis.\u00a0\u00a0I would definitely see a hepatologist and a rheumatologist as well.",

            "answer": "Hi Richard,I don\u2019t know much about AIH, other than the little I\u2019ve picked up from others in this forum. Our immune system involves some amazing dynamics; the thought of something this powerful turning against us frankly scares the cr@p out of me. There have been several people here previously that have been diagnosed with AIH, and have recommended the Autoimmune Hepatitis Support Group, UK. Here\u2019s the address: http://www.autoimmunehepatitis.co.uk/aih/I understand that this site has undergone some changes, including possible change of ownership; try it and see if you get a better response to your questions. As mentioned above, the vast majority of us here are dealing with Hep C; we just don\u2019t have the knowledge base to offer much advice. Sorry to hear of your diagnosis, my friend- if you get a chance, let us know if the UK site helps so we can refer others if necessary.Happy journeys, and take care-Bill",
