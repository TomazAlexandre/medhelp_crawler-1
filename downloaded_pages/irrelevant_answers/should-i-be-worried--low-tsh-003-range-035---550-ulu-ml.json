            "answer": "Of course you need to lower the levothyroxine dose with the prescription of your consulting doctor. Also apart from that please check your Vitamin D3 level. If you have low or not optimal Vitamin D your hypothyroid symptoms may get worse especially when increase levothyroxine dose. If doctor is not willing to check do it in a private lab.
