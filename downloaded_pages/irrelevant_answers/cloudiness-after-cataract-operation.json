            "answer": "Hello Dads Helper.\u00a0\u00a0Any cataract surgeon knows about the capsule behind the implant turning cloudy. If that is the problem the surgeon should have recognized it easily. The figure now is closer to 30% than 50% and the cloudiness can develop anytime from immediately after the surgery to many years later to (in 70%) never.The most common reason by far for subnormal vision after cataract surgery is disease elsewhere in the eye. The most common place is the retina-specifically the part of the eye you read with called the macula. The most common macular disease is age related macular degeneration. Other causes are retina damage from diabetes, hypertension, macular holes, macular swelling (edema), macular membranes.Sometimes the patient may mean that the vision is \"cloudy\" when not wearing glasses. The vision should be judged by wearing the best possible glasses for distance and near. This is nothing personal against your father, but some older patients have damage to their brain in the visual areas from stroke, age, degenerative diseases (Alzheimer's being unfortunately the most common) that prevents them from properly interpreting the vision messages from the eye.You might ask for a clarification from the original surgeon. Ask for the best corrected before and after surgery. If you feel that your questions are not being addressed or you are not comfortable with the answers then by all means schedule a second opinion with another experienced eye surgeon.JCH III MD Eye Physician & Surgeon",

            "answer": "I just had catatract surgery last week.\u00a0\u00a0I was told by the doctor that 50% of patients develop scar tissue behind the lens within two to three months.\u00a0\u00a0This causes cloudiness.\u00a0\u00a0There is a simple procedure that is performed in the office that gets rid of the scar tissue permanently.\u00a0\u00a0I am surprised your doctor doesn't know this.",
