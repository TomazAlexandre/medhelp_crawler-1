            "answer": "I don't think saying \"PVCs are certainly not benign\" is very helpful on this board.I think it all depends on what's the cause and what's the effect. You won't believe how many people who are saying \"I have a headache because my blood pressure is high\". They can even measure their blood pressure during a headache and find out it's high. Does that prove that their headache is caused by high blood pressure?No, there are several options:1) The headache and the high blood pressure can share a common cause (like stress)2) The blood pressure may be high because s/he is in pain.etc..I'm not surprised people with PVCs may have higher mortality and lower ventricular function than people without. It does NOT mean that the average guy with a healthy heart and some PVCs are at risk. PVCs are more common in the setting of heart diseases, which means that people included in the study who have PVCs also may have a heart disease.It could also be that their PVCs are caused by low ejection fraction. PVCs are much more common in the setting of reduced EF or after heart attacks, or in other diseases linked to increased mortality (like electrolyte disturbances caused by kidney failure, etc.)Since PVCs may be caused (not causing) by heart disease, I recommend everyone who experience them to visit their doctor for testing. But once heart disease is ruled out, I think you should go back to living a normal and healthy life without worrying.",

            "answer": "The CHS cohort are volunteers that were healthy at the start of the data gathering in 1989.\u00a0\u00a0Many studies have been published regarding the data from this group.\u00a0\u00a0The referenced paper looked at PVC frequency history specifically as it relates to heart failure years later.\u00a0\u00a0If we are to tell people that PVCs are benign, that would be no different than telling them high blood pressure, BMI, diabetes, CAD are also benign when it comes to heart failure.\u00a0\u00a0Read and listen to the editorial response to the paper from Marchlinski.\u00a0\u00a0He is one of the top experts in the world on VT and heart failure.\u00a0\u00a0Clearly the old guidelines and 20,000 pvc/day rule of thumb have been thrown out of the window.\u00a0\u00a0Med school text will have to be updated.\u00a0\u00a0Abnormal PVC's are not caused by low EF - that doesn't make any sense.\u00a0\u00a0PVS's lead to cardiomyopathy which in turn causes EF to goes down and VT.\u00a0\u00a0That is definition of heart failure.Yes I agree that we do need to do everything possible to have healthy habits and destress.\u00a0\u00a0Take mg and K supplements if that helps.\u00a0\u00a0Meditation and yoga if that helps.\u00a0\u00a0 etc ...\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it will be important to monitor that PVCs don't increase in frequency and that ejection fraction remains in a normal range over time.I know we like tell people that come around here that everything is probably ok and that the are over reacting.\u00a0\u00a0That maybe true in many cases.\u00a0\u00a0Healthy life style is important and may be all that is needed for many.\u00a0\u00a0But there will be many unlucky ones as well and we need to be realistic about what needs to be done for them.",
