            "answer": "Hi,fasting for longer than the recommended can mean fasting blood sugar is HIGHER not lower than it would otherwise be.\u00a0\u00a0This is because extended fasting can encourage your liver to put out sugar in response to the fast.Your result is totally normal fasting.Did your Dr test your Hba1c?\u00a0\u00a0This is average blood sugar over the past 3 or so months.\u00a0\u00a0If this is also normal you probably don't have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0There are many other possible causes for symptoms.let us know how you go with your Dr next Thursday.",

    "question": "Hi, sorry for bothering you again, i decided to create a new post to clarify my previous question. So here it is:I did a fasting blood glucose test and was told to fast for 12 to 14 hrs. I ate at around 8pm and got tested at almost 10:30 am, so you see i fasted for almost 15 hrs. My result was 4.67 mmol/L. Now, I am worried that it may be inaccurate since i fasted for more than 14 hrs, so it might be the rrason while i got a normal blood sugar. My question is, does it work that way? Does blood sugar lower when you dont eat? Pls help me, i am 21yo and the breadwinner of my family. I am anxious because i have some diabetes symptoms, and my nxt appointment with doctor is next thursday, so i want to hear the opinion of those who went through this test. Thank you in advance",
