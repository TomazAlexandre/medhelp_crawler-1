            "answer": "I am the youngest of four sisters and have a similar situation with my oldest sister.\u00a0\u00a0Our mother died from ovarian cancer when she was 52; her mother (our grandmother) died from cervical cancer at age 55. All of us have had regular screenings for many years, except for my oldest sister.\u00a0\u00a0One of my sisters and I went so far as to have prophylactic hysterectomies with removal of the ovaries when we reached age 50.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 57.\u00a0\u00a0My other two sisters and I have been \"religious\" about our GYN exams and mammograms.My oldest sister, now 67, has NEVER had a mammogram and her last GYN exam was after her youngest child was born 40 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0We have all talked to her, sometimes to the point of harassment, to try to get her to the doctor, but she just refuses to go.\u00a0\u00a0She says she doesn't want to know if anything is wrong with her.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, this denial has led to some other problems for her.\u00a0\u00a0Last year she had a compression fracture of the spine that was caused by severe osteoporosis.\u00a0\u00a0That could have been avoided if she had gone for a bone density test and started on medication when the osteoporosis first started.\u00a0\u00a0She had to be hospitalized when she almost went into a diabetic coma because she had not been tested for diabetes and her blood glucose was over 500.\u00a0\u00a0She is now on medication for both the osteoporosis and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0She does see a doctor for those, but he doesn't insist that she get either mammograms or GYN exams.There is nothing you can do for your sister.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried everything with mine.\u00a0\u00a0I can certainly understand the \"I don't want to know\" attitude, but I also know that if I hadn't gone for a routine mammogram 5 years ago, I would not be writing this.\u00a0\u00a0Try and try, but it probably won't do any good.Regards,Brenda",

    "question": "I'm wondering if any other women are in my position. I am one of three female siblings, the middle daughter. My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 50 and underwent a mastectomy. I and my younger sister have fibrocystic C-cup breasts, whereas my older sister is very flat chested. At age 40 I began having somewhat regular mammograms (no insurance so I skipped some years) because of my mother's history. I assumed that my sisters would do the same, but didn't give it much thought. I got careless a few years ago and skipped mammos for about 4 years. Bad idea. When I went in last year, with no baseline pictures on file due to time and moving, I got a BIRADS 5 on my mammogram. Turned out to be fat necrosis (YAY!), but scared the you know what out of me and gave me a bit of post traumatic stress that lasted until my clear mammogram this year (YAY again!). But going through the stress of my approaching annual mammogram this year finally spurred me to ask my little sister about whether she and my older sister get regular mammograms (they both live in the same town in Alaska and I live in California). Little sister hemmed and hawed and confessed that she doesn't get them more than every two years (she just turned 50 this year), and then only because her GYN holds her depo provera shot hostage until she gets a mammo. Then she told me no way no how will older sister get a mammo, as she hates to be touched. Well, that is starting to bug me. But she is very unapproachable about personal health issues. And she won't go to a doctor for any reason other than near death.Have any of you dealt with a sister like this? Suggestions?",
