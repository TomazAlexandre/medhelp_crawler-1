            "answer": "A CT scan would probably not show a small tumor. CTs are good for certain things, while MRI's tend to be better with soft tissue.Sorry to hear that you suffer from headaches. Migraines can include sensitivity to light and cause a lot of the symptoms that you describe. There are many medications on the market to manage and treat them. There is a headache forumhttp://www.medhelp.org/forums/Migraines--Headaches/show/123The dizzyness that you describe sounds like Orthostatic hypotension also known as postural hypotension. The disorder can be associated with diabetes. Anyways have you ever seen a Ear, Nose Throat type Doctor for this vs a neurologist? Our inner ear controls balance. So an ear infection can cause. That type of doctor would do a different type of workup and might be able to shed light that could help.Has your endo ever tested your\u00a0\u00a08am fasting cortisol or IGF-1? Those are two hormones that pituitary tumors could secrete that would affect your blood glucose levels too.Pituitary tumors are diagnosed with labs tests, and clinical symptoms. If the lab tests show a problem then an MRIs is ordered. The problem is that MRIs may or may not show small adenomas.You say that the symptoms are 1.5 years old and came on with the diagnosis of type one diabetes. Now that you are one insulin has there been any improvement in your symptoms?Anyways- your symptoms sound very annoying and possibly serious. But they are non-specific and could be due to so many things.My recommendation is1. Ask your endo about testing for those two hormones and2. Get a referral to an ENT for evaluationGood luckHorselip",

            "answer": "Not really-We are not doctors here. I am a pituitary patient. I rec you explore the headache forum and ask about those two hormones.Since you already had the dizzyness checked by a ENT and neurologist I'm stumped. You could always seek another opinion if the headache route does not does not yield anything.Because of your young age you might be getting dismissed if you are not speaking up for yourself.Those are the only things that I can think of.Horselip",
