            "answer": "Hey there! I don't think you need to limit yourself to a certain amount of carbs per day. I would recommend trying a high protein and high fiber diet. Also try meal planning. Having a plan will ensure that you aren't going overboard on carbs, and knowing how many carbs you'll have for each meal will help you plan your bolus more correctly.Hope that helps",

            "answer": "HiHow many carbs depends on how much carbs your body can handle and you can cover properly with insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Many people with diabetes find that a low carb diet (est. 100 g/day) or even a very low carb diet (est 40 - 60g)/day works for them.\u00a0\u00a0The carbs come mainly from non-starchy vegetables.You will have to work out by trial and error (using your meter) what works for you.\u00a0\u00a0 Also you will need to check out how to properly dose both basal and bolus insulin.Look up dr. Richard Bernstein.\u00a0\u00a0His book is called diabetes solution.\u00a0\u00a0he is the master of low carb eating and optimal diabetes management (he is 82 and has had diabetes for about 70 years).\u00a0\u00a0He also has a series of lectures on utube.You can also research on \"type1grit\", this is a support group all using low carb to achieve normal blood sugars.Hope this helps.",
