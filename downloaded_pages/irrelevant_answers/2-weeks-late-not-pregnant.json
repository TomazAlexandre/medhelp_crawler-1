            "answer": "have you asked your doctor to check your iron levels and glucose levels? if the level of iron in your blood is low, you may be anemic, which causes fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0if the glucose levels in your blood are off it can cause frequent need to urinate and fatigue, not to scare you, but the only reason they caught my dad's diabetes is that he was needing to pee all the time and was tired all the time, my mom thought it might be prostate related with him because of his age, and had him go to the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0when the doc found no problems with my dad's prostate, he did a blood glucose test, and found that my dad's levels were extremely high.\u00a0\u00a0once they gave him the proper medications to bring his glucose levels back down to a somewhat normal range, he was less fatigued and didnt have to go pee near as often. i would insist on the doctor continuing to run tests to find out whats going on.",

    "question": "Hi there, I was hoping someone could give me some answers to whats going on with my body. My lmp was 5/14 and I was due to start on 6/10. So Im a day short of being 2 weeks late. My periods are always on time. Even though I do have hypothyroidism I am on medication and my periods have never been affected by this. I have taken 3 HPT, two were negative and one was positive so I went to the doctor and had a blood test done 2 days ago and it came back negative. Any idea why i have not started my period yet? I do not have any symptoms of being pregnant other than having to pee all the time and being really tired. Im not stressed at all and cannot think of any reason why my peroid has not come if I am not pregnant.",
