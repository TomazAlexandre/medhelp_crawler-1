            "answer": "Hi, understand your anxiety. Normal values for SGOT is 0-35 and SGPT is 4-36. Your lab values are raised. The values could be raised due to alcohol consumption. Was an ultrasonogram done? Did it show fatty changes? Fatty liver can be due to alcoholism when it is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Non alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. In addition to avoiding alcohol, avoid smoking also. Avoid drugs like paracetamol and sedatives. Get vaccinated for hepatitis A or B. Take a good protein diet. Repeat your tests after 3 months to see how they are progressing. Regards.",
