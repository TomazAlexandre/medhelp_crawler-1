Noone nows why, I have read that sometimes it can come back to life and cause temporary hyperthyroid. A few of us have the same autoimmune. If you have any questions keep posting!",

            "answer": "Hashimoto's is an autoimmune disease, as Cynnieb4 said.It is the most common form of hypothyroidism.It can take many different paths. For some people it is a minor interuption and then life goes on. For others it is a significant problem. There are several degrees between those two extremes.Having an autoimmune disease increases your risk of developing another autoimmune disease.When the immune system goes whacky, the result is unpredictable.Hashimoto's is a condition where your body is attacking your thyroid. How things go depends to a degree on how many antibodies you have and how diligent they are.",

            "answer": "Normally they only test it once if it comes back high.Sometimes they will retest it for one reason or another, like if you are wanting to get pregnant and the doctor wants to assess the wisdom of that desire.My TPOab has been checked more than once, but only because the Endo I went to didn't trust anything in my records and wanted to see for himself what his lab had to say about my blood.He tested for all antibodies, even though my GP had already done the same thing.My GP would probably run another set of antibody tests if I asked him to. It would be mere curiosity on my part, and a matter of him satisfying my curiosity. Since I no longer have a thyroid, it would be interesting to see how much the levels have dropped on the various antibodies.Most of the time the test is not repeated if the initial result is high because there isn't much they can do about it anyway. It is considered a waste of money unless there is a compelling reason to check it again.",

You may also test positive for TGab as well, or not.If you test positive for TSI, you have Grave's. You can have Graves and also have TPOab, and/or TGab, but it is still Grave's Disease.That's why it is best to test for all of them.In your case, with a diagnosis and history of hypothyroidism, a TSI test is going to come back negative, so it is probably a waste of money.",

            "answer": "Hashimoto's Disease is the most common form of hypothyroidism.There are several causes of hypothyroidism, most of them temporary. You can have a Pituitary problem that gives you permanent hypothyroidism.But the most common cause of hypothyroidism is autoimmune, Hashimoto's.Type 1 Diabetes is autoimmune. Type 2 diabetes is not. However, many people with hypothyroidism eventually develop type 2 diabetes, due to weight issues. High cholesterol is quite common as well.When you have one autoimmune condition, there is a propensity to develop a second or third autoimmune disorder. Pernicious Anemia is also autoimmune, as you mentioned.It IS a little scary, when you think about it. It is not a foregone conclusion that you will continue to develop other autoimmune conditions, but it is possible.Your doctor needs to run antibody tests. It does not change your treatment, but a diagnosis of Hashimoto's is more specific than a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. It tells you what you already know, that you are at risk to develop other autoimmune conditions. The tests can give a small hint as to how quickly the disease will progress.It also seems to change SOME doctors' attitudes about treatment. Hypothyroid = take these pills and we'll retest in three months. Hashimoto's = we'll retest in six weeks, and oh by the way, I'm ordering an ultrasound of the thyroid.That's not always true, but doctors are sometimes flippant about hypothyroidism but when it gets called Hashimoto's they perk up. Or not.",

It sounds like you need to either grab your doctor by the ears and demand his/her attention, or seek another doctor.If you can get your thyroid hormone levels correct, you can probably stop taking the Lipitor eventually.

            "answer": "TPOab is thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Thyroid Peroxidase is part of the chemical makeup of thyroid activity, and antibodies attack and destroy peroxidase cells.TPOab is a malfunction of your immune system and it indicates an autoimmune activity. It can be found in low numbers in several autoimmune diseases, but if it is found in high numbers it is indicative of Hashimoto's.There are other factors to be considered, as I mentioned above. An ultrasound will often show a thyroid that has the classic signs of TPOab damage.But he really shouldn't hang a diagnosis on you without running proper tests.Hashimoto's doesn't go away after it's fixed. Your antibody count may go down quite a bit, but you will almost always have antibodies above the lab range. You're stuck with the autoimmune part for good.",

It happens to most people.TPOab is more common than TGab, but they both point to an autoimmune thyroid condition.You can develop one antibody this year and a second antibody next year. You may end up with TPOab, or not.The only difference between someone with one antibody and someone with two antibodies is how many types of antibodies they have.
