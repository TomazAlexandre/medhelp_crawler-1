            "answer": "I have gd. A lot of times your blood sugar levels can be controlled with diet and exercise some people need medication to help stable their blood sugar. I check my blood sugar 4x's a day once in the morning and then 1 hr after each meal. Part of the diet is watching how many carbs you eat but it's also about balancing your carbs with protein. Your suppose to eat 3 small meals and 3 snacks a day. Your Dr will give you more in depth info when you go for your appointment.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps",

I'm 27 weeks , 28 tomorrow and this whole pregnancy I haven't been able to hold much down other than fruit. I have yet to even gain a pound(baby measures perfect tho). They had me take the test 3 (due to having diabetes in my fam) different times amd this is the first to say I have it.\u00a0\u00a0I'm just shocked at the way I found out and the fact that now I have to see some stranger specialist and\u00a0\u00a0I can't see my doc who I have seen for years.",

    "question": "I'm so upset. I took my 3hr test on Monday and a few minutes ago recieved a phone call from the hospital I am suppose to deliver at about a appointment for next week that I had no idea about. I call back and she tells me it's for my gestational diabetes. GESTATIONAL DIABETES?!!! No one informed me! So I call my doc and the nurse is so apologetic that I found out that way. That they were planning on calling me, but they were so busy. She then informs me that I will no longer be seen by my doctor who I saw with my previous two pregnancies and have been seeing for 9 years! This stinks all around! I can't even describe how upset I am. Does anyone have GD, can they give me advise?",
