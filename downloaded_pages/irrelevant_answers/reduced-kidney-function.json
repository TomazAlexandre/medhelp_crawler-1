            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Are you referring to GFR? According to the National Kidney Foundation, normal results range from 90 - 120 mL/min/1.73 m2. Older people will have lower normal GFR levels, because GFR decreases with age. Your level is below the normal range. The reducing values could be due to diabetes or hypertension or other kidney diseases. Only further investigations can help diagnose the cause.To improve this you can check to see if you are a diabetic or hypertensive and have these controlled. Also, avoid alcohol and stop smoking. And exercise regularly. Recheck your values at regular intervals.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
