    "question": "hello,I am 6weeks and 4days. I went to the ER yesterday after i noticed some bleeding. Dr said they found an abnormality in the gestational sac but it was too small to determine what it was and that i should follow up with ob/gyn. My first appt is already scheduled for tomorrow morning but i am super nervous. This is my first baby and no mother to be wants to hear bad news. Does anyone have any similar stories they can share with positive outcomes???",
