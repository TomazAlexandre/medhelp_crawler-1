            "answer": "Hi there!I can understand what she and the whole family must be going through. I am not sure how old she is but unless of certain age (4-6 years) kids do not pick up logic well and trying to reason with them might not be a good idea. You could try incorporating this with a positive reinforcement / reward each time she takes the insulin. If she is old enough you could try to make her understand that though she might be one of the few kids who have diabetes but there are kids less lucky than her and it is her strength despite the diabetes that makes her special from other kids. For long term you could sign up for behavioral/ psycho therapy sessions after consultation with her treating doctor.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

            "answer": "depending on her age i highly recommend the pump! it changed my life i was at 4 shots/plus a day and refused for a while and i was old enough to know better. shots never get easier in fact as i got older they got harder because i became self aware of the bruising they left behind. the pump more or less eliminates the need for the needles!",

I wonder if anyone has been through this and has any advice for us please?",
