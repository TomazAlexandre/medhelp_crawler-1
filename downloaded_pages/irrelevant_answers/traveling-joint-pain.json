            "answer": "Hi,Since when are you having these symptoms? Are you on any medications? Is your blood pressure and blood sugar in the normal range? Have you consulted a doctor for your symptoms?There could be several causes for the symptoms you are having. Have any xrays been done? Which joints are involved?Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that causes stiffness and pain in the joints. Osteoarthritis involves growth of bone spurs and degeneration of cartilage at a joint. It is very common in adults older than 45 and can cause joint pain.Joint pain may also be caused by bursitis (inflammation of the bursae). The bursae are fluid-filled sacs that cushion and pad bony prominences, allowing muscles and tendons to move freely over the bone.For nonarthritis joint pain, both rest and exercise are important. Warm baths, massage, and stretching exercises should be used as frequently as possible.Anti-inflammatory medications may help relieve pain and swelling. You could take some over the counter pain releif medications and apply some pain releif gels or creams to see if it helps with your symptoms.Let us know if you need any further information.Regards.",

            "answer": "I have had these symptoms for over a year now. I am currently not on any medications. My diabetes is strictly controlled with diet and exercise, as well as my bp. I spoke to my doctor about this while I was dealing with issues related to diverticulitis. She felt that what was going on was due to toxicity from that. Well in November of 07 I had an attempted resectioning of my colon, but due to complications I was given a temporary colostomy. My joint symptoms went away for 2 months post surgery, but returned only worse. While in the hospital for the surgery I was on a morphine pump which could have helped with the symptoms.Also because of the obesity I have dropped 100 pounds thinking this would ease the symptoms, unfortunately there has been no relief. The pain has gone from a few days a week to constant. I spoke again to my PCP and she will not do testing, because my husband lost his job and insurance and we are currently paying 50,000.00 for the take down of the colostomy, which occurred in April of this year. She did put me on prednisone for 2 weeks to make sure it was an inflammatory issue. It was like heaven when I was on them. I could walk without assistance of a cane or someone to hold on to and I could get on the floor with my grandson without worrying how I was going to get back up.My pain is currently in my toes, ankles, knees, fingers, wrist, elbow, shoulders, and somtimes the neck and jaw. I have also recently discovered when the pain is extreme I have a discoloration of the finger joints. This is mainly on the joint of the proximal and middle phalanges.I originally felt that this could be RA because of my age, 41, and the sudden onset. Although, recently I have been wondering if SLE could be a possibility. I have history of it in my family and I have these patches of discolored, dry, scaly skin on my inner elbows and chest. These patches do not look like psoriasis which is why I am wondering if possibly SLE.Thanks again for your help.Phyllis",

            "answer": "Hi,In spite of the reduction in weight and no apparent benefit, it is still possible that you may be having these symptoms due to the obesity and the damage on the joints as well as the absence of any pain previously because of the Diabetes.On the other hand, I would still advise you to get tests done for both SLE and RA and also get yourself examined by a Joint/ Orthopedic Doctor.Do you get any relief with OTC pain killers, if yes, you may use them with the necessary precautions.Hope this helped.",

    "question": "For approximately the past year I have been having joint and muscle pain that travels. I can wake up one morning and have pain in a couple of fingers on one hand and possibly the opposite elbow. That will persist for a couple of days and then nothing for maybe a week. Then I will wake up and have a hard time getting out of bed because either one or both feet hurt or one or both knees hurt. It doesn't seem to be picky about what joints that hurt. I have type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and am moridly obese. I am still active and my job does consist of standing and working with my arms so I would really love some help on which to turn.Thanks in advance for any helpPhyllis",
