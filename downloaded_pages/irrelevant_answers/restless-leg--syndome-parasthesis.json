            "answer": "Hi Rohit,How are you feeling now?Any type of tingling, burning, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a sensory nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. The nerve involved appears to be originating from Sciatic nerve.This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, vitamin deficiency, altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency or abnormal endocrine status.Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the legs and an uncontrollable urge to move when at rest in an effort to relieve these feelings.Chronic disease like\u00a0\u00a0kidney disease, diabetes, peripheral neuropathy are also cause for RLS.If you are moving about in bed to relieve pain, have creepy and crawly feeling in leg, motor restlessnes with increase in symptoms as night progresses, a diagnosis of RLS is certain.I think you should consult physician and another neurologist to re-evaluate your case.Bye.",
