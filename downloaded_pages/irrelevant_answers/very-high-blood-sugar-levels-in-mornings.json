            "answer": "Hi there!I would suggest checking the blood sugar levels at around 1-2 a.m. in the morning (4-6 hours after the night dose). If there are low, his night time dose may need to be decreased while if these are high the dose may need to be increased. I would suggest consulting an endocrinologist for suggestion of an appropriate management plan.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

            "answer": "Hi! I have diabetes for 16 years (I was 12) and i'm using Lantus for about 1 year now... I take 42 units in the morning (my weight is 57kg) and 3-4 units of novorapid before main meals....\u00a0\u00a0and sometimes I have hypoglycemia 4-5 am but in general my blood sugar is quite normal.... what i'm trying to say is maybe your son needs to increase his lantus dose, watch his night meals carefully... and of course consulting an endocrinologist is essential...Hope your and your son best!!!",
