            "answer": "I am currently in my third diabetic pregnancy. I also had polyhydramnios with my first child, though i did NOT test diabetic with her. I will tell you, it can be uncomfortable carrying the excess water but as long as your practitioner is aware, they will monitor baby and you. If it turns out you have diabetes, don't panic. It is an adjustment but nothing i have found to be overwhelming. Sometimes diet can keep things under control, sometimes you need insulin. Also, dont be surprised if a diet keeps things in control and then you might need insulin closer to delivery. As baby grows, your insulin resistance can go up, meaning you need more assistance. All very normal! My three current babies were all born healthy and thriving. My current baby is due in March and he has given me my easiest pregnancy yet- very active, healthy and measuring on target for age!",

I had a natural birth that was so fast... I think because there was only 15 months to the between my 1st and 2nd. Good luck and try no to worry so much im sure its quite common.",

    "question": "Hi all, I am 33 weeks and 4 days, 38 years old and pregnant with my third child. I was told I had excess fluid around baby and am to have a scan next week. I was tested for glucose tolerance but the clinic messed up with the blood samples so I have to do the test again. I am extremely uncomfortable, feel so bloated and ready to burst out of my skin. I also noticed I am bruised around my belly button, not from any injury I can recall but I guess from the pressure. I am worried about baby so going to get checked out at Gp later today. Has anyone else experienced this?",
