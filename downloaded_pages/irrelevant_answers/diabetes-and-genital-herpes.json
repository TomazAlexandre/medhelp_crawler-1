            "answer": "Hello resol2x,I hope someone here can find more info than I could, but \"in general\" diabetics have a tougher time fighting infection IF our blood sugars are not well-controlled.\u00a0\u00a0Bacteria love a sweet environment and uncontrolled diabetes provides that.Diabetes is a chronic disease and thus it takes some \"marathon\" type skills to manage it well and to enjoy a full rich life.\u00a0\u00a0If I'm not mistaken, there are no cures for genital herpes either, and so a person with both conditions is asked to be vigilant about many things.Many of us have had diabetes for 35+ years; I know many diabetics who've had it for 45, 65 or 70! years.\u00a0\u00a0While genetics does play a role in whether/when we suffer complications, diligent learning and self-care are essential.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that's true for folks with GH also.Do check back, cuz there're many folks who read & post here.\u00a0\u00a0We are specialized in providing info and support on diabetes, so pls feel welcome to post questions on particular diabetes issues, too ...Good luck.",

            "answer": "Those of us who man this web site are not physicians; hence, I heartily recommend that you call your endocrinologist and ask these questions for a proper medical answer. However, I did some research and can perhaps give you some information. There are many web sites that speak of genital herpes, its current treatments, and risks. Try this web site out for more specific information. It will give you about 3 web pages of materials, and I am sending you to the first page. The information on long-term risks is on the third page, so keep reading.Now, as far as any complications due to being a type 1 diabetic, you may notice that your glucose levels rise when you have an outbreak, for sickness of any sort can elevate glucose levels in some people. Each person is different, so you will have to watch closely and see exactly how your own body responds to any viral activity which triggers the immune system. Being diabetic may cause the outbreak episodes to last longer or be worse if glucose levels are high, for any illness is harder to fight off when the diabetic is not under good control. Also, for the diabetic who is poorly controlled, anything that causes lesions to the skin might allow bacteria to be introduced and therefore start a secondary bacterial infection. So it would make sense to watch the glucose levels carefully if an outbreak occurs. There are now medications that can stop an outbreak pretty much in its tracks, and I would not worry overly much about this being a cause of a shortened lifespan.",
