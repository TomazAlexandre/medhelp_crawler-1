            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, pain in armpit could be due to wire of the bra pressing, swollen lymph node or due to sweat dermatitis. It is also possible due to peripheral artery disease. Peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes, chemical burns due to any deo or lotions you use, peripheral nerve compression are the other possibilities.Shooting pain in hip can be due to pinched nerve. You will need nerve conduction studies and MRI of the spine for diagnosis. Hope this helps. Take care!",
