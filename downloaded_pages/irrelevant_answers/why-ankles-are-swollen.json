            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!The swelling of feet could be due to water retention as in low protein in blood, kidney problems, heart problems, pressure on the dorsal aorta, severe anemia, deep vein thrombosis, liver diseases etc. It could be due to hypothyroidism too. Diabetes Mellitus too can cause similar symptoms. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "As usual Drnee has provided an excellent survey of the situation. I would suggest that the word \"fluid retention\", in the form of lymphatic liquid, rather than water retention, might give a clearer idea of what is happening. Simple gravity is causing the fluid to accumulate in the lower extremities. The compensatory mechanisms to (a) eliminate the fluid from the body and (b) pump it upwards from the legs, are not working well. There are many reasons why excess fluid is not eliminated from the body. Kidney malfunction is one of these. Physicians commonly prescribe so-called \"water pills\" to get rid of fluid. These are called diuretics. The most common and inexpensive is Furesamide, sold as the brand-name \"Lasix\", which comes from \"lasts six hours\".\u00a0\u00a0Ordinary vitamin C, however, especially in the crystaline form, is an excellent diuretic. About 1000 mg a day of crystaline C in two divided doses would help you out. Elastic stockings are also used, but you need to see a physician before using these. They cannot be too tight. Elevation of the legs also helps, as well as purchasing an old-fashioned rocking chair. You really need a good work-up by an M.D. to rule out all the possibilities. I would not consider this a pressing emergency, but something you should schedule within the next sixty to ninety days, at the most. You should insist on a thyroid test, which includes what is known as the TSH number (Thyroid stimulating hormone). An ultrasound of the legs for vascular evaluation is in\u00a0\u00a0order, as well as a full cardiac work-up, blood pressure check, A1C (diabetes check) and stress test. Make sure you have an A1C scheduled. Obesity is often linked with this kind of a problem, and a weight control program with moderate exercise is in order. Insist on a good work-up with labs, and not just a wham-bam thank-you ma'-mam visit. When you sleep at night, put a pillow under your ankles to elevate the feet and consider a chair that tilts back. The tilting chairs can be partially reimbursed by insurance if authorized by a physician, if he writs a \"certificate of necessity\". They run about $1,000 and insurance will pay you fifty-percent of that.",
