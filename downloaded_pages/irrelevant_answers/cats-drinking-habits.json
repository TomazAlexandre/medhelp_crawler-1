            "answer": "If I understand correctly, cats do not usually drink a lot of water.\u00a0\u00a0I'd suggest a trip to the vet for a kidney function test.\u00a0\u00a0If there is some impairment, you can help kitty to have more good years.I err on the cautious side here because our old cat, Calamity Jane, started both drinking more water and losing weight; she was 19.For the last 2 years of her life we (after our vet showed us how) give her fluids with an IV needle under the skin between her shoulder blade.\u00a0\u00a0Just 50 - 60 ml of \"Ringer's Lactate\" solution 2 - 3 times a week keep her in good health until a pair of strokes got her at 21 years 4 months.Another cat, Cerridwen, we didn't notice excess drinking or weight loss, but kidney failure got her within 12 hours of when she did show signs.\u00a0\u00a0She was about 16.take care - Pip",

            "answer": "drinking lots is 'good' keeps urinary tract crystals from forming, most cats don't drink nearly enough water.But a check up would be a wise idea too, especially depending on kitties age, excessive drinking can also be a sign of diabetes in people as well as cats....Pip is right best to err on the side of caution.",
