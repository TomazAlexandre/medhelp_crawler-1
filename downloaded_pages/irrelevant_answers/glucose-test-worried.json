    "question": "I have to go back and take a 4 hr glucose test tomorrow. Im worried because I had the 1hr done on monday. So now im wondering what might have come up on my results. They said they couldn't give me any info over the phone. That the dr would tell me in person tomorrow. Just wondering if any ladies have had this test done before and what I could expect during the test. Do they need to take blood out every hour?Im just worried I may have gestational diabetes. This is my third pregnancy and never had an issues with my other two pregnancies. Im scared. Advice please!! :-(",
