            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Chronic constipation can be due to diet poor in roughage or fiber, dehydration, diabetes, hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc. It can also be due to milk allergy and other food allergies. A proper investigation is required preferably by a gastroenterologist (a doctor who looks after the digestive system) to know what is the cause. The treatment will follow correct diagnosis.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
