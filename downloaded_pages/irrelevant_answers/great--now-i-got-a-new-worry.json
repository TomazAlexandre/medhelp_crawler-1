            "answer": "I was very dizzy for a long time and I had been in a bad accident (I was hit by a car) so for sure I thought something was terribly wrong. I also have been suffering Panic Attacks and I get dizzy with loud noise, lights especially supermarkets.I also was lifting weights and had a permanent stiff neck when I stopped doing it so much my severe dizziness went away as I guess I had a trapped nerve in my neck which was restricting the blood flow. You may want to get your eyes checked too. Try to cover all your bases and you'll get the answer.I explained to the doctor that my head felt like a balloon, that it wasn't on my body...sounds the same as you.",

    "question": "It seems like my life is a never ending wheel of misfortune.\u00a0\u00a0I finally get some peace about one medical worry, and another one takes it's place.In March, I started freaking out when I noticed that I was urinating a lot and getting up multiple times at night to urinate.\u00a0\u00a0For weeks, it was a torture of fear that I had a UTI, kidney disease or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Even though I don't have health insurance, I ran to the doctor in desperation.\u00a0\u00a0After 200 bucks in costs, I found out that I don't have diabetes or kidney disease, but I might have a liver problem.\u00a0\u00a0In other words, they couldnt' tell me the true cause of my problem.But like many of my problems, once I stop being so afraid of it, it usually goes away.Well 8 days ago, I woke up with a headache and this weird feeling of lightheadedness.\u00a0\u00a0I havent felt dizzy where the room is spinning, just a feeling like my head is screwed on loose.\u00a0\u00a0I don't remember ever having this sensation for a prolonged period of time.I felt normal all day yesterday and totally forgot about the sensation until it hit me out of the blue while I was shopping.\u00a0\u00a0Now I am really worried.\u00a0\u00a0This opens up a whole new world of troubling possiblities,\u00a0\u00a0brain turmors,\u00a0\u00a0clogged arteries, heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0It feels so bad at times that I just want to lay down and not get up.Could this be a normal sensation with anxiety panic attack?\u00a0\u00a0It has always been raining a lot here this week which really stirred up my allergies.\u00a0\u00a0I'm really screwed here because I can't go back to the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I can't afford another 100 bucks for an exam, and I'm sure he will just tell me it is either nothing or order a MRI scan which would cost a fortune.\u00a0\u00a0THIS *****!!!!!!!",
