            "answer": "Before you take another dose of Effexor, go to Google, type in \"Effexor Withdrawl\".\u00a0\u00a0Are the withdrawls of getting off Effexor worth the benefits of taking it? ABSOLUTELY NOT!Now, go back to Google and type in \"Natural Cures for Depression\".If what I have been thru, trying to get off of this Evil drug, stops just 1 person from ever getting on it, then maybe it's been worth it.I wish I would have educated myself on what I was putting in my body, before I did it.",

            "answer": "not sure how old you are but are you on b/c pills?\u00a0\u00a0That could be the reason for multiple periods....if you are on b/c, you may need to switch.\u00a0\u00a0I would definately call the doc on that.As far as the Effexor side effects go, the first week or two it really mellows you out and yes, you do sleep a little more, at least it affected me that way.\u00a0\u00a0I am now on 75 milgrams and after a couple of weeks you settle into your old routine.\u00a0\u00a0Effexor has worked great for me, especially with the racing thoughts and anxiety.",

I have diabetes and depression and I have been reslly really tired lately and having hair loss and multiple periods each month.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor thought it might be stress. I was given effexor. Since I started effexor, my fatigue has greatly increaed. I am really tired, just washed out, and stay in bed until 10 or 11 each morning. Is fatigue a side effect of effexor? Colud my fatigue be related to something else?",
