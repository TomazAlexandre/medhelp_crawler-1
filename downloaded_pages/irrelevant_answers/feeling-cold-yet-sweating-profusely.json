            "answer": "It could be the Fibromyalgia.\u00a0\u00a0Fibro causes problems with your hypothalamus gland which controls your body temperature, sleep and a range of other things. I have had the symptoms you are describing.\u00a0\u00a0Your body could also be trying to fight an infection, so I would check your temp. when these symptoms occur for fever. Your symptoms don't sound hormone-related to me, although hormone problems make Fibromyalgia symptoms worse. Also make sure it's not an adverse reaction to Cymbalta or something with your Diabetes.Warm Regards,Ree4tu",
