            "answer": "I too suffer from extreme anxiety, fear of diseases, and it makes life so painful at times. When I'm with my family; I'm never truly with them. When I'm out, I want to be back home. My life has been a series of painful events.I think you would benefit from seeing a therapist; a therapist that has training in anxiety disorders, exposure based treatments. For example, expose yourself to the stuff you fear and soon the fear becomes less. Expose yourself to the things that make you want to run and don't run and you'll train your brain that you'll be okay. It's not easy. It's awful.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like you have health anxiety and some features of OCD, GAD, Social anxiety. Anxiety disorders in general clump together.But you can do this.I'm currently on a bad spiral and I'm feeling hopeless these days. I wish you the best.",

Our summer vacation is no fun at all because I don't feel like doing anything. Just worrying about everything, constantly. I have always paid a lot of attention to my body and different symptoms,\u00a0\u00a0right now I'm worried sick because of a distortion in my vision. Eye doctor says I'm fine but that doesn't really matter. Worried that this could be a brain tumor (probably not but I can't help how I feel ).This is just one of my many \"diseases\".I feel better when I work because I don't have time to think about myself... I hope I can feel better someday. Maybe therapy or something .",

    "question": "Please can anyone tell how to overcome my fear of Diseases?My problem started since I was 6, it began with an extreme fear of diabetes. Whenever i heard the word diabetes, I start to panic and have trouble breathing, my stomach hurts, get diarrhea and then start to feel the actual symptoms of the disease. In fact, I stopped sleeping on my left side because i am scared that would damage my pancreas. Moreover, if i touch a paper that has the word diabetes written on, I always wash my hands so as not\u00a0\u00a0to contract diabetes. i know that i won't get diabetes through touching the paper and that diabetes is not contagious,I still do it though. Now my problem is not only limit to diabetes but also, i have this extreme fear of psoriasis, vitiligo ,any thyroid disease and aids. I keep checking myself many times every day looking for symptoms and when i notice any small change i rush to the hospital. Now, I am 20 and this problem has really affected my life; it made me socially inactive. I can not interact with people because i am scared of contracting any disease.",
