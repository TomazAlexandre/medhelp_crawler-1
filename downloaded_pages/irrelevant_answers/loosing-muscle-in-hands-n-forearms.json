            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Muscle wasting could occur with problems in the spine, the brain and the cranial nerves. A neurologist can help detect this. Sometimes it could be due to an inflammatory muscle disease, in which case a muscle biopsy may help. Also, has diabetes been ruled out? Check with your doctor regarding these conditions.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Sagar, you have not mentioned what the results of your tests showed. Was a diagnosis made? Were there any nerve conduction defects? If it is carpal tunnel syndrome, it should show in the nerve conduction studies. The nerve innervating (supplying) the thumb, the index finger and the middle fingers is the median nerve. This can get compressed in the wrist, leading to numbness of these areas leading to a condition called Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. The nerve can get compressed due to obesity, Diabetes Mellitus, hypothyroidism, arthritis and trauma.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
