            "answer": "Having Diabetes II is unlike HCV because it is controllable. And, you will not be subjected to injecting toxic cocktails that has who knows what future health reprocussions. You have basically answered your own question, \"I know that many times diet, exercise, and such can delay, or stop, the progression of this disease...\" This what any good doctor will tell you. Control your diet is the main ingredient - STOP eating deserts ladened with sugar, cut back on carb intake, dairy products etc., then moderate exercise helps burn off the extra sugars. If you haven't visited the AD web site do so http://tinyurl.com/34etc6. Tons of info on how to control diabetes.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the reply Wave.\u00a0\u00a0I'm somewhat familiar with diabetes and it's treatment given the history of it in my family as I grew up.\u00a0\u00a0I've also visited the site you indicated and found it chock full of good usefull information.I'm also aware, and learned the lesson more soundly while dealing with my other medical condition of HCV, that when they call it practicing medicine that the optimal word seems to be upon \"practicing\".I've also seen patients who were not properly treated for their diabetic condition, and unfortunately some even had to pay for that with their very lives, despite it's more common occurance and do not desire to play a trial and error game to find a good knowledgable doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Especially given that I must also deal with the secondary and perhaps more lethal HCV condition.So, I had hoped someone may have a link to a list which provides referals to doctors in my area for this condition as I did not find such a thing readily available on the AD website.But judging from the response, either such a thing does not exist and/or this MedHelp forum is not as heavily utilized as others and it takes longer for someone to provide the desired information.",

            "answer": "I don't recall what the diet was again.\u00a0\u00a0GP seems to think that diet and exercise might do the trick at this point.\u00a0\u00a0Awaiting a call from educator and still searching for a \"qualified\" diabetes doctor in my area who is able to confer or take my other condition into account as well.\u00a0\u00a0Nobody in the medical community seems that alarmed, so either it's not to bad yet or they got so many patients that they don't care if the loose one or two.At any rate, if your still following, I'd appreciate seeing the diet you're using again.\u00a0\u00a0Please post here though as I'm not going to the HCV forums anymore.

    "question": "Is there a site which provides a referal of \"good\" doctors in one's area, or is this so common that unlike HCV one does not need to be as concerned about physicians competency?Background:Spent 10 months on chemotherapy for HCV last year,which meds and rescue meds all run the risk ofaggrevating diabetic condition.\u00a0\u00a0Throughout tx bloodindicators were within normal range.\u00a0\u00a0Was pulled fromtx last November as a nonresponder to chemotherapy.Grandmother, father, and brother were all diabetic.Lost father to insulin shock shortly after medicationchange and he was not careful to watch regular dietand exercise changes. Thus, I ran a familypredisposition, which is why I required a closerwatch on blood counts while on HCV tx, althought Ihad to almost insistently demand it at times.Started experiencing swelling in right ankle andcalf in January and was prescribe a diuretic forwater retention that appeared to help for about amonth.\u00a0\u00a0Recently was prescribe compression socksand increased dosage of diuretic. Non-fastingCBC showed a nonfasting Glucose of 146.Fasting test done today shows Glucose 128 and LipidPanel:Trig 173HDL 19LDL 57ratio 5.84Total 111Diagnosis was to contact a Diabetic Educator with a later follow-up with GP.After my experience of starting HCV chemotherapy with an inexperienced doctor, who may have compromised my tx priorto acknowledging that my case was too complicated, I'm a bitcagey, too say the least, of just going to any old doctor andam looking for a referal list which may increase my odds of finding a doctor who can provide me with best tx program.I know that many times diet, exercise, and such can delay, or stop, the progression of this disease and as such desire a doctor who knows their stuff, not desiring to be a guinea pig for another one trying to learn by OJT application of book knowledge.Any help anyone can provide would be greatfully appreciated.",
