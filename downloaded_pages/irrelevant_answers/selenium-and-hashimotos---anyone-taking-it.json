Selenium and/or iodine deficiencies cause goiter. Selenium is the most important mineral to counter the toxic effects of heavy metals. Selenium is essential for production of glutathione peroxidase which is one of the three most important antioxidant defenses of the body. Can be toxic at levels of over 1000 mcg per day. Goiter will result from a selenium deficiency (or iodine deficiency), and many hypers and hypos have goiter.Mercury in silver amalgam fillings uses up selenium for detoxification. High amounts of amalgam fillings may require more selenium. Don't take over 600 mcg. per day unless you have an unusually large amount of amalgam fillings (more than 8).CHROMIUM Involved in glucose metabolism and insulin production and works hand in hand with selenium. The conversion of T4 to T3 is influenced by insulin, which is probably the reason why diabetics have low thyroid function.",

            "answer": "I had a TSH of 7.69 and thyroid antibodies of 602.7 when I was tested in September of 2007. I started taking 200mcg of selenium with 400IU of Vitamin E together every morning, as Vit E maximizes the absorbtion of Selenium. I was tested again 3 weeks later and my THS went down to 5.4 then again three weeks after that and my THS was at a 4.3 by Christmas that year I had dropped back into a Normal range of TSH 2.1..my antibodies are still high at a 201.3 bit they've dropped ALOT! I'm now getting my silver fillings removed, because I can pin point when my Hashimoto's started when I got my first five fillings summer of 2006! I'm hoping this will lower the rest of the antibodies. Selenium has been a real miracle for me as I'm only 25 and was so sick with Hasimotos Hypothyroid that I was having severe panic attacks and could not leave my house for 8 months!! My doctor has now told many of her patients about Selenium after seeing my results, she was never thought there was a \"natural cure\" for Hashimoto's, but I'm LIVING PROOF! It has also helped many of her other patients.",

            "answer": "All of my kids have \"Hashimotos\" looking thyroid glands and are slightly hypo. They have been on a little Armour and 200 selenium for over 2 years and have never shown positive for the antibodies for thyroiditis. I think this is being prevented by the selenium, and so does my doctor. We also started on a mineral protocol about 6 months ago - Dr. Paul Eck research about\u00a0\u00a0mineral pattern balancing- which includes about 50 mg of zinc and other minerals, and both of my teenagers TSH took a nosedive, so that they are no longer having to take the Armour. (Zinc increases thyroid activity) This was great.We have also been gluten free for a year. Gluten does contribute to thyroiditis and is implicated in many autoimmune diseases. It's not Celiac disease I am talking about here- most people are slightly intolerant to gluten especially as we age. We all tested negative to Celiac, but were positive on a gluten intolerance test, which is different than food allergy test. Gluten is a thick gummy substance that is incredibly hard to digest and the wheat products today are much different than the wheat products of decades ago. My father had terrible RA, and went gluten free and within 2 weeks was off all meds and was basically pain free. Alopathic medicine is clueless about any of this, unfortunately. Much of all degenerative diseases are caused by the foods we eat ( mainly gluten and dairy which are the hardest to digest) which slowly destroys the small intestines, which compromises our immune system- then we contract chronic infections and parasites which must be treated. (Check out Dr. Daniel Kalish's website- he is a genious and has a great article about gluten intolerance and chronic/autoimmune disease.) We were all tested by Metametrix labs by DNA stool analysis, and had various specific parasites and candida. (Yuk!) It is a vicious cycle that needs to be broken!",

            "answer": "First things first - I don't know that there IS a \"pro-active\" treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Autoimmune diseases are not preventable to my knowledge.I have had silver amalgam fillings since I was a teenager and only was dx'd with hypo/Hashi's in June of 2008 (check my profile - I recently turned 60), so I'm not convinced that would have anything to do with it.\u00a0\u00a0 I think if you are prone to autoimmune diseases you are going to get them -period.I, personally, have hypo/Hashi's and pernicious anemia (both autoimmune).\u00a0\u00a0My son was dx'd with Juvenile Diabetes (type I) @ age 10 (he's now 37).\u00a0\u00a0My daughter (age 34) was dx'd last year with lupus.\u00a0\u00a0I have a nephew with type I diabetes, dx'd when he was in his 30's and my oldest sister, who's in her 70's also has type I diabetes-dx'd only a few years ago.\u00a0\u00a0Along with that, there are several in my family who have type II diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I have one sister who also has hypo/Hashi.\u00a0\u00a0I'll even add the heart problems here..yeh, we have them too, even though they aren't autoimmune.There's my family history in a nut shell - oh yes, I encourage my kids to have THEIR kids tested at the first sign of ANY symptom of ANY of these diseases.\u00a0\u00a0I don't advocate taking up residence in the doctor's office, but when you have these things in your family, you need to be aware of, and pay close attention to, symptoms of the rest of the family.Being aware of the symptoms of these autoimmune diseases is crucial.\u00a0\u00a0Prior to my son being dx'd with type I diabetes, I had NO experience with the disease and NO inkling of the symptoms, etc because we had no family history of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0At that time no one on either mine or my husband's side of the family had ever had it.My son began exhibiting behaviors that were \"out of character\" - basically, irrational - like one day it was snowing lightly (we lived in Iowa at the time & snow was NOT uncommon) and I had the kids ready to head down the driveway to the bus, when my son saw that it was snowing VERY lightly; he stopped in his tracks and INSISTED that *I* call the school and tell them that they had to call off school for the entire day because it was snowing and HE wasn't going to go.\u00a0\u00a0I put it down to him being 10 yrs old, having a few problems in school and not wanting to go.These behaviors kept up until one day his teacher called me and said she thought he needed to go to the doctor and when I asked why, she explained that he was thirsty all the time, had to go to the bathroom all the time, etc and it was disrupting the class.\u00a0\u00a0Now me, being totally clueless, figured he had maybe a bladder infection, etc.\u00a0\u00a0HOW WRONG COULD I HAVE BEEN??\u00a0\u00a0I made a doctor appt and as luck would have it, his pediatrician was diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0How lucky for us because by then this poor child that *I* had thought was being \"difficult\" was almost in a coma and was admitted immediately to the hospital - a few hours longer and we might have lost him.I only went into this much detail because it's so important for us to know and watch the symptoms of these horrible diseases.\u00a0\u00a0*I* wasn't a bad mother - I just didn't know the symptoms and what the disease was all about.\u00a0\u00a0Do I regret my ignorance? You bet.These things take us on such roller coaster rides, it's absolutely incredibly horrible.\u00a0\u00a0The sad thing is - when my thyroid \"wigged\" out, *I* exhibited some of the same behaviors that my son did and *I* didn't see it coming for myself any more than I did for him, because I didn't know the symptoms of hypo/Hashi.Yep, be aware and have your other children checked at the first sign of ANY of these diseases.\u00a0\u00a0*I* learned the hard way not to take this lightly.......
