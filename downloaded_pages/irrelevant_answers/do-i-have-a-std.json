    "question": "I am 48 yr old male. a few months ago I had a small unsuccessful surgery done\u00a0\u00a0- stent to remove kidney. lots of bruises inside the penis. SO they gave antibiotics which I found intolerable. I did not complete the course and Dr. was ok with it. So every now and then I used to have strange sensation inside testicles and the joint between penis and testcle area..now when I lean to right and put my left leg over on right and stay in this posture for long time I start seeing slight twitch in penis and very mild, pain in left testicle for a few secs and goes away. about 8 weeks ago for the first time i had sex outside marriage (I am feeling very guilty ever since) and during sex candom broke.I took it out immediately and finished.had shower. now last 2 weeks I am having frequent urination urges. Burning in penis area but not during urination. no bumps or splots on penis or inside.(not circumsized). Urine does not smell foul or bad. No discharges of any kind. however, I see lots of acnes again (which I used to have when I was 14-29) and leaving black spots on my face and nose. Even scalp seems to have these. looking ugly. my wife also started getting them this late last week. Out of anxiety I took oraquick at home test which came negative. what is happening to me? Am I at risk of any STD? Should I do anything? please help.",
