            "answer": "I was browsing through the forum and found your post.Just because you don't eat sweets, doesn't mean you are not eating the right foods.\u00a0\u00a0Sweets is just a part of it.\u00a0\u00a0You\u00a0\u00a0have to watch your total carb intake, and the kind of foods you eat.\u00a0\u00a0A person could eat a meal including a large potatoe and peas and send their sugar through the roof.\u00a0\u00a0Eating a lot of pasta or rice will do the same thing.Because of my size, 5'6 and currently 169lbs down from 212lbs two years ago, I eat 45 good carbs per meal, three times a day, and 15 good carbs for a snack two to three times a day.As a snack I eat a yogurt at 13carbs, or a Glucerna shake at 18carbs.\u00a0\u00a0I try to eat any fruit with my meals instead as a snack, and it helps with how fast the sugar from the fruit enters my system.Your sugar levels are definitely dangerously high.\u00a0\u00a0I agree with checking with a specialist, and maybe a nutrishionist to help you get a better handle on the proper foods.",
