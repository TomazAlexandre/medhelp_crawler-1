            "answer": "hI, I just noticed that you mentioned that they removed your whole thyroid except for a small piece.\u00a0\u00a0I've heard, and am not saying this is the case, cause i'm not a dr, but have heard more stories with people having problems with partial thyroidectomys, than with just removing the whole gland.\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible this small piece is causing you trouble?\u00a0\u00a0I don't know. just a thought. There seems to be alot of other medical issues involved, that maybe could be causing a problem, I guess i'm just confused as to why they would leave such a small piece, as it sounds, why not take the whole thing?\u00a0\u00a0Shannon",
