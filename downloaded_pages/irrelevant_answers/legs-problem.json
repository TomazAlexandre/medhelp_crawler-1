            "answer": "Hi!One possibility for weakness in both legs is compression of spinal nerves in lumbo-sacral region, and thus MRI of lumbar and sacral spine should be done. Other possibilities are peripheral neuropathy like in diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, Reynaud\u2019s phenomenon, Vit B12 deficiency; anxiety and panic disorder; or even due to electrolyte imbalance. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, polio, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis are other possibilities.\u00a0\u00a0Please discuss these possibilities with your treating doctor. Take care!",
