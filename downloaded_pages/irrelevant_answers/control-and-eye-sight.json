            "answer": "Truly, getting control of the glucose levels is the most important thing you can do. Adrenalin put out by the body in jobs that are stressful can make it very hard to control those glucose levels. The best solution is to test often. Get the quickest glucose meter available to you and test often. Every time you test, you need to adjust if too high. Maybe this means you take a brief break, but you just have to do this to bring those levels down.Maybe it is time to do some job-searching. I have read other comments by type 1 diabetics that said that shift work made it hard for them to keep good control. Maybe doing some job-hunting will unearth a job more friendly to our needs.My own job is very stressful. I do graphic design, and deadlines are my worst nightmare. I absolutely have to test often and adjust when under tight deadlines. I find time to test when in between projects or when waiting for a design job to print out, or even when on the telephone with customers. I build that into my routine so it is part of my schedule. And I try to remember to test more often when under stress. Then I can catch highs before they are high for very long, and lows before they get serious. The result is an a1c that automatically lowers if you just adjust often.",

            "answer": "Please read my post. I treated myself with a combination of the Dr's drugs and Tumeric a spice from India. I have turmeric once a day in milk - two heaped teaspoons. within one month and 2 weeks I got my drivers lic back unrestricted I no longer needed heart medication all the issues relating to blood vessels and neuropathy and constant pain brought along with these sticky issues have been put to rest. now I am losing weight and feeling great.",

            "answer": "The comment above about weight loss leads me to suspect that the posting by samusay is from someone who is not a type 1 autoimmune system diabetic, but may be a type 2 diabetic. The diseases are very different. I am not sure of any benefit from tumeric on type 1 diabetes. No harm, either, but I want to point out that the two diseases are different. Weight loss is a big issue for type 2 folks, but type 1 folks are usually lean and our health issues cannot be improved by losing weight.",

            "answer": "Hi mateYou are correct in your assumption I am in fact a 1.5 diabetic. Meaning my body still produces from time to time, an amount of Beta cell 1% of the production which is the normal ratio of the melitus secretion. This is why all of my 10 or so specialists have given me a wash - they simply cannot work out why I am such a unique individual. One of them said \"if you are alive at 50 I want to write a book on you!\" Saying this the other thing to ponder about me is being that I still produce beta cells and have nearly all of the issues relating to DB my tenaciousness and strong spirit is causing me to move into a better way of life - I will not lay down and take my life for granted. In my opinion I control my body not medication! Medication is an evil that from time to time becomes needed for us to see where we are going wrong. Dr's are here to aid in this exploration and help us become who and what we are becoming and as such deserve the kind of money an actor makes! not the other way around. Regarding tumeric; if you have access to the net and do some seeking you will find out a lot of fantastic gems. Thank you for your comment friend it has lifted my day.",
