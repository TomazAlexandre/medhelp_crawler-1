            "answer": "Oh, it's probably a pinched nerve either at the hip or in the lower back.\u00a0\u00a0Nerve problems will cause numbness, tingling, pain, and the 'electrical current' you feel, since nerves carry electrical impulses.\u00a0\u00a0 Usually a doc will prescribe physical therapy to work it out and also give pain relievers until the nerve quits hurting.\u00a0\u00a0To get a diagnosis, your family doc can do a plane black & white X-ray to see how your bones are positioned, he can do a simple neurological exam to determine if your brain is functioning as it should (because a bleed can also cause what you feel), and he can draw blood to make sure your blood sugars are okay (because diabetes will cause numbness).\u00a0\u00a0He should have a record of any medications you're on, because occasionally they can do odd things to the nervous system.\u00a0\u00a0He can then decide if you need a more detailed scan or a referral to a neurologist or to another specialist, depending on what his findings are.",

            "answer": "I had the same symptoms as yours along with hip, tailbone pain and I was diagnosed with a protuding disc (from a MRI) even though my back didn't hurt. They said it was sciatica that caused the leg pain and numbness and tingling. I just got my second steroid injection and the pain is much better though I still have a lot of numbness and tingling in my lower legs and foot. In fact, my other leg and one arm has been tingling and becoming numb since Monday. Best bet is to go see your doctor. Good luck.",
