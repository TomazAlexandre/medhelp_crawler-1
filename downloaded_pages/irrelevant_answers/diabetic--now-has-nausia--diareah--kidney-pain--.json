            "answer": "HiThough oral sex has less chance of transmitting sexually transmitted diseases, the possibility remains quite on the higher side. So it will be wise to get a STD panel done that covers all diseases from gonorrhea to HIV to syphilis to Chlamydia.However your symptoms could be due to stomach infection. You must be aware that diabetics have more chances of catching an infection. It could be something you ate too. The bloody patch could be simple hemorrhage or bleeding into your mouth\u2019s mucus layer. However it is better not to ignore your symptoms. Please consult your doctor.It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted.",
