            "answer": "Congratulations on just getting started. What I've read on here is that each and everyone is different on this TX. I personally have RA and took my last pills on August 28th., of this year. My days were doable but I'm not going to lie some days were hard. Just try and stay focused on what your body is going through. One day at a time. My joints post treatment have been awful but getting better everyday. Get up everyday and thank God that I don't have to grab my crutches or wheelchair. Positive thoughts, positive reactions. Also, I read some post this week on your very question. The post would be on one of the previous seven pages. Have a good weekend. GoGG",

            "answer": "Yes. But hep c virus can cause pain too. Just be gentle. Heating pads or pain meds. Watch salt intake and avoid hard to digest foods! Easy on the liver, easy on your body.\u00a0\u00a0Next week I find out is my S&O treatment worked! I had the test yesterday (2 wks early due to complications, but I'll soon know!)",

            "answer": "Hi, I am on my 18th day of Sol/Oly and have degenerative disc and bad hips. I have not had any type of pain so far and feel pretty good. I am so happy it is going this smooth. I have been dx with fibro but I am wondering if it was just the hep c. I have had some rough times before treating. This may change as the seasons do. I will see then if it is fibro because Fall is usually my time for joint and muscle pain and through the winter cold. I am in NW Indiana and we had a bad winter and much snow last year. Hoping for a good outcome with my treatment!",

    "question": "Hello, today is one week into Sovaldi & Olysio and feel good. I had some anxiety when I started since I read\u00a0\u00a0couple of negatives towards second generation protease inhibitors( diabetes, cholesterol issues, lipodystrophy) hope all turns out okay. Another concern is my knee and shoulder, I had several surgeries and they been good for years but I read that Olysio can cause muscle pain and inflammation of the joints. Has anyone had issues with joints?",
