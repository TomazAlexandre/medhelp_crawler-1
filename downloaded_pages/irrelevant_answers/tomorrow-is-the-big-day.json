    "question": "I'm so excited!! Tomorrow December 18th in the morning I'm going to be induced! My pregnancy has been a bit scary since my 25 week when I developed high blood pressure then I developed gestational diabetes. They ended up putting me on bed rest during my 29 week. Wednesday I'll be 37 weeks exactly :) last week they were saying she was around 5 8oz and that because of the high blood pressure it counter reacted my GD causing her not gain as quickly. I'm praying our baby girl Emma Jane is a healthy birth weight and her sugar levels are perfect since I have been really good about keeping my sugar levels steady :) good news is that I was dilated to a 3 last week so they just need to start the contractions once I get there. I don't know how I'm going to sleep Tuesday night I'll feel like a kid before Christmas :D I'm a FTM so I am excited and a little nervous but I know we will be fine!",
