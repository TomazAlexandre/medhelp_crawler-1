            "answer": "Hi Mindy,I just finished reading your comments. Here's my take on what your catmay have. Based on the symptoms you say Jett is exhibiting, I wouldsay your furbaby may likely have diabetes. I say this because you sayJett has lost a lot of weight and is skin and bones. You say Jett isdrinking a lot of water and urinating a lot more. Both of these symptomsare associated with diabetes. Our cat, Sammy, whose eight years oldnow, had diabetes. You'll notice I said had diabetes. Sammy's diabeteswas detected through a blood test. The mention of Jett's untidy fur whichcan be a symptom of diabetes, it was with our Sammy. We adoptedSammy at 20 lbs. In three months, he lost about five lbs. He was drinkinghuge amounts of water and peeing huge amounts and he was gettingskinnier and skinnier. As I say, he lost 5 lbs. in 3 months. Our vet suggested a blood test. That's how the diabetes was found. Please takeyour precious kitty to the vet.\u00a0\u00a0Have your vet check him out and I suggestasking your vet to give Jett a blood test. Jett may have diabetes and ifhe does he will need insulin needles. Our Sammy needed one insulinneedle in the morning and one at night and special diabetic food.It might not be diabetes, but it may be. I know you said you're movingbut your 16 year old family member is sick and should be seen assoon as possible by your vet. It won't cost hundreds of dollars. Itdoesn't cost us hundreds of dollars. Good luck finding out what's goingon with Jett.\u00a0\u00a0Eve :) ( mother of Sammy)",

            "answer": "When my cat had diabetes, I did not find the cost of his shots burdensome at all.\u00a0\u00a0But one thing is certain, if it is untreated diabetes, you will see him die if you do nothing.\u00a0\u00a0A visit to the vet, and a frank talk about costs, will help you a lot in deciding what to do.",

            "answer": "I do agree with eve and Annie - fist take the cat to the vet, get what he really is suffering from and then get a plan for paying the costs.I also believe it is diabetes.Dont take a drastic resolution that you will probably regret soon - just do it if the cat is really suffering and nothing more could be done to help him.You say he's now quite attached to you - it means he trust on you and is asking your help.",

            "answer": "I am going through the same thing with my cat. I have had him so long he is part of me. I hate seeing him this way, he seems to get around but he looks so pitiful and wobbly and he seems hungry all the time. I try wet food in the mornings and hot dogs in the day and evening he loves them but lately he has not been eating his dogs either and losing more weight. I looked on one sight that's says he needs more protein and better food, but I feed him the same as I always have, I have tried to increase the wet food thinking his teeth was hurting but I don't know I wish I could afford to take him to a vet but I am disabled myself and not working waiting for social security to finalize their decision. I am working with a voc rehab counselor now looking for a part time job I can do with my handicap so if I can get one soon I can take him then so I have hope.",

            "answer": "so sorry to read of the troubles your kitty is having. PLEASE stop feeding hotdogs they are loaded in salt and very dangerous for a cat!!I know how difficult it is to come up with money esp when faced with issues yourself that I am so sad to read about.In my opinion, since your kitty is older...you said he's been with you a long time, so I am assuming he is. this problem with eating but continuing to loose weight is often associated with HyperThyroidism and is common in older cats, has to be diagnosed and can be treated with medicationsat the very most stop the hot dogs.NOW feed him only canned food, even some of the cheaper brands like fancy feast as long as its PATE or ORIGINAL never the ones with gravy added, or grilled or marinated...thse are loaded in carbs that are not healthy nor nutritious",

    "question": "Thanks in advance for any advice you can give me. I have a 16 year old house cat. He is a long haired cat who use to weigh upwards to 15 pounds. He weighed more than my dogs... In the last year he has been losing weight and has become skin and bones (or hair and bones) He eats well but is also drinking more water and urinating much more. He has never been outdoors , except under our supervision. He also has had a change in his personality, he wants to be with me where ever I am and follows me everywhere. He use to hang out and do his own thing, you know how cats can be. I love the attention he is giving me but he is just not himself. I have thought of kidney problems, diabetes...how long does a cat live untreated with one of these diseases? I am in the midst of a move also and this is going to be stressful on him as all he has ever known is our current house. I love my Jett and would also like to know what treatment cost may be for any of these diseases. I would also like to add that his well kept fur is now looking so untidy, he just can't take care of himself as he use to. H e has never been sick, such a healthy cat. He also had an episode one day where he was so weak he couldn't make it to the litter box and defecated on the carpet...that was a first, but he seemed to recover the next day. Any ideas or advise would be greatly appreciated.",
