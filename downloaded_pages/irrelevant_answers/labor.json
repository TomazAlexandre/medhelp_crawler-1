            "answer": "She wants to get things going so early because I can't go passed 39 weeks due to gestational diabetes. He would gain too much weight if I went full term.

    "question": "I had my doctors appointment this last week, and my doctor said she is going to scratch my cervix to get things going when I am 37w3d. I am a first time mom and I have a very low pain tolerance. Can anyone give any tips on how to deal with contractions at home before going to the hospital? My doctor said they will send me home if my contractions are too far apart.",
