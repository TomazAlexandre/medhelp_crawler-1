    "question": "Hi, I'm a medical student and was just wondering if it was okay to use this forum to ask qusestions for study purposes?For example, with regard to ketone bodies, are they continously produced at low levels by the body due to oversaturation of glycolytic pathways with acetyl CoA, or are they only produced after guconeogensis has run its course and Beta-oxidation has started and thus the acetyl CoA is turned into ketone bodies as they can't be taken up into the glycolytic pathway?Thanks",
