            "answer": "For once I read that a dr will give Xanax (also avail G) insteadof the expensive anti-depressants that have all kinds of stuffthat they forget to monitor. Do not use anymore than 1mg 4xday.Brain can adjust to it too much & become mentally dependant.Once stablilized, you can adjust dose. Try to really work onwhat the source is. B-100 helps brain also to adapt w/ moods.Junk food/soda/family problems need to be adjusted. May even behormone balance do to your age. Try to find what your realtrigger is. As far as mouth/tongue/breath, brush well w/ a babysz brush in back of throat & rinse brush w/ hot water then putin a glass of some water & neuk 1 min in micro to kill germs.Try Biotene mouthwash especially P.M. It's alcohol free.Alcohol, even in Listerine dries mouth more & makes bacteriaform faster. Biotene toothpaste also helps to coat teeth soparticles don't cling. Dry mouth can be a signal for an under-lying problem so if it persists, talk to doc again. Snoring candry you out. An immune disorder can start w/ this symptom. I'mguessing it's your anxiety. Increase water to 8 glasses a day.That's why you make saliva. Sugar-free gum or sucking onsomething like butterscotch candies will help train glands tomake more saliva. Buy the Biotene & try it. Really works & youcan even put it in a small spritzer to spray a squirt on tongueduring day. You're young & pretty smart to know so early thatyou need to fix a problem. Give yourself a big pat on the back.",
