            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Diabetes can cause increased bacterial action in mouth and this may give an odd taste. It could be due to infection of gums or cavities in teeth. It could also be an abnormal perception of bitter taste called dysgeusia. GERD and heart burn too cause metallic taste in mouth. Post nasal drip as in sinusitis, salivary glands infection, pharyngitis or strep infection too are common causes. Certain dentures and artificial tooth or filling of dental cavities too give an odd metallic taste. Sjogren\u2019s syndrome and copper or lead toxicity are other possibilities. It can also be common side effect of many medications.OK here are a few tips for you. Try them. They should help. Have citrus juices, lemonade and foods marinated in vinegar. They help in washing away the metallic taste by producing more saliva. Brush your teeth and your tongue with a tongue cleaner at least twice in a day and surely at bedtime. It will help in lessening the metallic taste. Vit C tablets, over the counter oral mouthwashes will help fight the taste. Increase fibers in the diet. Eat fresh things like apples that are crunchy or rough things like popcorn scrapes the white debris off the tongue.If it doe not help, consult a doctor. Take care!",
