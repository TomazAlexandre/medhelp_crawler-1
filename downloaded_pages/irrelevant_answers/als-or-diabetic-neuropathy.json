            "answer": "kimmie,Regarding doctor, my experence is that some are very narrow focused. Dont be shy (as you were not) in asking questions and demanding tests.\u00a0\u00a0ALS in a rule out diesese, so proper procedure for a Dr. would be to have a battery of tests done before any conclusions. You should get mri's of brain and spine as well as blood tests, amoung others.Also, do your best to stay positive. I know this is easier said than done. I've been under this cloud for 2 1/2 years and no one who has not experenced it can truly know what its like.But I can tell you the better my attitude is the better I feel, and I mean physically.Best of Luck",

    "question": "I went to my neuro for foot drop that was in my left foot.\u00a0\u00a0He sent me to a physical therapist and he also conducted a Nerve conduction test and an EMG.\u00a0\u00a0He said the nerve conduction was great but the EMB showed the Axiom levels were increaced.\u00a0\u00a0I am afraid he only suspects ALS.\u00a0\u00a0My father died over 30 years ago and until his death did not know what he had.\u00a0\u00a0A doctor at the hospital where he died wrote my mother and said he really suspected ALs but the tests were not conclusive during my father's battle with his illness. My foot drop is improving now and my toes are now working.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to Emory for more invasive testing.\u00a0\u00a0My neuro did not want to do other tests but I demanded a lyme disease test, diabetes test, and a heavy metal test.\u00a0\u00a0What could it be?\u00a0\u00a0Why does he only suspect ALS?",
