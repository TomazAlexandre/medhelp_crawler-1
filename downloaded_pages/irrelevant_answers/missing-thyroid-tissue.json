            "answer": "Has your husband been tested for anything other than TSH, such as FT3, FT4, TPO ab, or TG ab?\u00a0\u00a0 If not, that would be a good idea to get done now.\u00a0\u00a0From what you said about his meds being constantly adjusted up and down I expect that the doctor is using TSH as a diagnostic, which is totally inadequate.\u00a0\u00a0TSH is a pituitary hormone that is affected by so many variables\u00a0\u00a0that at best it is an indicator, to be considered along with more important indicators such as symptoms, along with levels of the actual, biologically active thyroid hormones free T3 and free T4 (not to be confused with total T3 and total T4).In my firm opinion the best way to treat a thyroid patient is to test and adjust the levels of the active thyroid hormones, FT3 and FT4, with whatever type medication is necessary to relieve symptoms, without being constrained by the resultant levels of TSH.\u00a0\u00a0 A good thyroid doctor would be willing to treat your husband this way.\u00a0\u00a0It does not have to be an Endo, just a good thyroid doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Many Endos specialize in diabetes, not thyroid, and many do not meet my definition of a good thyroid doctor because they have the \"Immaculate TSH Belief\".Rather than waiting for all that time until July 6, and maybe finding out that the doctor doesn't fit your need, I think I would call there now and ask to speak to a nurse and then ask her these questions.\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0Is the doctor willing to test for free T3 and free T4, along with TSH?\u00a0\u00a02. Is the doctor willing to treat a patient for symptoms, by adjusting the levels of free T3 and free T4 as necessary to relieve symptoms, without being constrained by resultant TSH levels?\u00a0\u00a03.\u00a0\u00a0Is the doctor willing to prescribe meds other than synthetic T4?\u00a0\u00a0If the answer to a question is no, then you should keep looking for a good thyroid doctor that can answer yes to all three questions.",

            "answer": "I just saw the test results you posted on another thread.\u00a0\u00a0Many of the tests are somewhat obsolete and not very useful.\u00a0\u00a0One exception to that is the TPO ab test result, which was high.\u00a0\u00a0That and the symptoms you mentioned would point to the most prevalent type of thyroid problem, which is Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.\u00a0\u00a0If you are not familiar with this disease, it causes the autoimmune system to produce antibodies that attack the thyroid glands until they are ultimately destroyed.\u00a0\u00a0While this is going on, especially at the beginning, the TSH levels can vary widely, due to the glands leaking thyroid hormone.\u00a0\u00a0 Many of our members have gone through this very thing.\u00a0\u00a0One of our very experienced members (TamraW) highly recommends this book about Hashi's.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0www.thyroidbook.comBeyond that, I highly recommend what I suggested above.",

            "answer": "Okay, I'm confused.\u00a0\u00a0When treating the T3, T4, is there a different medication prescribed, or do they just adjust the Synthroid.\u00a0\u00a0(Sorry if this is a stupid question, but the whole thyroid problem is a bit overwhelming, especially when he has anxiety attacks, etc., which is totally and completely out of character/symptom for him).\u00a0\u00a0He is on many, many meds and would some of the meds interfere with thyroid function.\u00a0\u00a0(He takes the following meds daily:\u00a0\u00a0Synthroid 200 mcg [takes this by itself 2 hrs before he takes any other meds]; then he takes Avinza 90 mg(1 daily for chronic pain); Prozac 40 mg (1 daily); Lyrica 150 mg [for peripheral neuropathy]; Actos 30 mg [diabetes]; Triglide 160 mg [high triglycerides]; Glimepride 4 mg twice daily [diabetes]; Vytorin 10/40 [cholesterol]; Plavix [blood thinner - had a stroke in Feb, 2008]; Klor-Con 10 [potassium supplement]; Digoxin 0.25 mg (heart);\u00a0\u00a0Indomethacin 25 mg daily (headaches - Rx by Neurologist); and Zonisimide 100 mg once daily); Flomax .4 mg (once daily); and Lasix 20 mg. (once daily).\u00a0\u00a0Needless to day, despite our group insurance and his Medicare our pharmacy bill (copays) is more than the mortgage payment each month.\u00a0\u00a0I would think that all these meds might also have a bearing on his symptoms, but have never seen anything addressing this.\u00a0\u00a0It seems that whenever something changes, we never stop taking a med, we only add another to the list.Thanks so much for your help.",

            "answer": "Wow, that is an amazing list of meds.\u00a0\u00a0I suspect that if his thyroid levels were optimized to relieve related symptoms, that some of those meds would become superfluous.\u00a0\u00a0But I'm not a doctor obviously, just a thyroid patient.Regarding your question, you really are not treating T3 and T4, you are treating symptoms, by adjusting the levels of free T3 and free T4 (FT3 and FT4).\u00a0\u00a0The thyroid glands produce mostly T4 hormone and some T3.\u00a0\u00a0Most of this is inactive because it is bound up with protein.\u00a0\u00a0Only the small portion that is unbound (free) is active to regulate metabolism and most other body functions.\u00a0\u00a0 Think of T4 as a storage hormone that circulates through the body.\u00a0\u00a0As necessary it is supposed to convert T4 to T3 hormone.\u00a0\u00a0T3 is at least four times as active as T4, so it is very important to know the level.\u00a0\u00a0Many doctors don't bother to test for FT3 because they just assume that if they test for FT4, then they know the approx. level of FT3 as well.This is not the case when a patient does not convert T4 to T3 very well.\u00a0\u00a0Also,\u00a0\u00a0when on significant doses of T4 meds, conversion is inadequate.\u00a0\u00a0For example, when I was taking that very same dose of 200 mcg of Synthroid, my T4 level was at the very high end of the range, yet I later found out my T3 level was at the very low end of the range and I continued to suffer with lingering hypo symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0FT3 also correlates best with hypo symptoms,\u00a0\u00a0So, in view of its importance, why not just check and make sure.As far as medication, the most effective way for many patients is to use a T4 type med, such as Synthroid, a long as they can achieve an adequate level of FT3 that way.\u00a0\u00a0When they need additional FT3, then they can adjust it individually by taking a T3 med such as Cytomel, along with the T4 med, or some prefer to use a combo T4/T3 med such as Armour Thyroid or NatureThroid.In my opinion I think you really need to find a good thyroid doctor, by which I mean one that can answer yes to those three questions I listed in my first post.\u00a0\u00a0It would be great if you can find an Endo that also is a good thyroid doctor, because there may well be other testing that should be done as well.\u00a0\u00a0Once you get the testing done and his FT3 and FT4 levels adjusted to relieve symptoms,\u00a0\u00a0the doctors can better assess the need for the other meds.",
