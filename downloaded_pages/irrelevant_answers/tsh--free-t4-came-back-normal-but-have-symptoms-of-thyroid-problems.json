I never saw the exact results, but he had said that my blood-work was abnormal and that it was pretty clear that something was up with my thyroid. He suggested I see an endocrinologist.I spoke with my GP today and he told me the same thing - that my test results from the neurologist were clearly pointing to hypothyroidism, but that the latest test results looked normal. He said that he's not sure as to what's going on. I'll discuss the information you provided me with with him on Thursday and see if it's something he's willing to do, or if her just wants to kick me to the endocrinologist.I really appreciate the help, goolarra.",

T4 is a storage hormone and needs to be converted into T3.\u00a0\u00a0the Body's cells ONLY use the FREE T3 hormone.\u00a0\u00a0So if the conversion process is having trouble, there may not be enough of the active T3 in your body and THAT is the cause for your being Hypo even with plenty of FT4 storage hormone in your bloodstream.Just another theory and it is another reason why it is important to get your Free T3 levels checked.It always amazes me that the medical industry will not test for the ACTUAL Thyroid hormone that does ALL of the work.\u00a0\u00a0The end result.
