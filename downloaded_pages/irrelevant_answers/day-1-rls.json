            "answer": "Hey Jay - google the Thomas Recipe. Its a bunch of over the counter vitamins that taken as advised, will REALLY help you with your WD's. Bananas are a great help, as they are easy to stomach and the potassium helps with the rls. Water, water, water!! The more you can flush your system the better, and you are going to probably dehydrate yourself with sweating and GI issues. Loperimide (active ingredient in immodium) was a lifesaver for me, it helped with my stomach issues. Congrats on making the jump, it does get better and you are on the right track. Hope that helps!",

            "answer": "Hi there ;)RLS is caused by a chronic deficiency of vital minerals like Calcium, Sodium, Magnesium & Potassium. It can occur w/ certain diseases like diabetes, peripheral neuropathy & kidney disease. It's also a side-effect of certain medications. In our case (luckily) it's\u00a0\u00a0a passing side-effect of detox.Things that will help: A healthy, unprocessed diet, proper hydration (lots of plain water & no caffeine, alcohol, energy drinks, etc), a powdered Cal/Mag/Zinc supplement used as directed. Some folks swear by Tonic water but I have no personal experience with it. Hot baths w/ epsom salt & massage.Please, let us know how it going!We're here :)",
