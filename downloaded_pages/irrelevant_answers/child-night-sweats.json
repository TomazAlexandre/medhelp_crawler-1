            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, it could be allergies. However it could also be diabetes, hyperthyroidism, adrenal gland problems, pheochromocytoma,\u00a0\u00a0carcinoid syndromes, tuberculosis and other infections. It can also be due to low blood pressure. Get his thyroid and adrenal gland function tested. Ask him to wear loose clothes. He should avoid too much of tea, coffee, smoking and spicy food.\u00a0\u00a0Please get your son properly investigated once for increased sweating.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "My son sweats very heavily during the first 2 - 4 hours of sleep at night (enough to drench the bed), or even when napping.\u00a0\u00a0He stops sweating later in the early morning hours, and his body is usually cool and dry.\u00a0\u00a0During the day he runs and plays, eats well, and doesn't seem to show any other adverse symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0He was born prematurely (26 weeks), and did have a level 4 brain bleed at about 3 weeks of age, but so far has been blessed with normal physical movement and no signs of cerebral palsy, even though the docs thought he would show signs of it - at least dragging a leg or arm.\u00a0\u00a0He plays baseball and basketball and has great fine and gross motor skills.\u00a0\u00a0He is 6 years old.\u00a0\u00a0We've had him tested for diabetes, and no signs of that either.\u00a0\u00a0Can sweating be caused by allergies?\u00a0\u00a0He does have allergies to dust mites, and I've wondered about food allergies.",
