            "answer": "\"I want to wait and observe my symptoms till 8 weeks\"Please don't try to observe anything. It will get you nowhere. Only the tests can define your status. Try to stay calm and positive. Although vaginal intercourse is a risk, a one time exposure isn't that likely to get you infected. Furthermore, you don't know your partner's status. And remember that most people do not have HIV. So, just go about your life and try to keep a positive attitude, and remember when to test.",

    "question": "Hello there...in a 30 year old male from Africa. on February 13 this year, I had virgina Sex with someone I met at a party and I don't know her HIV status. I used a condom and during the Intercourse I noticed the condom broke and about 30 seconds later, I stopped,changed the condom and continued. At orgasm, I removed my penis from her virgina and I ejaculated inside the condom. That was my exposure the next day I started a course of antibiotics(I have heard that one can take antibiotics after such exposure-myth).about 4 days Before this exposure, I had high mosquito infestation and I was feeling sick but not much. Now after the exposure and the party, I felt terribly ill..4 days after (17th of February), I noticed at once that I have bitter/raunchy mouth, white coated tongue, fever,joint aches, no sore throath,no swollen nodes. I wa a still on the antibiotics and I noticed redness in my body. Chest & belly and legs an arms.the redness will appear and disappear.I went for a blood test on the 19th of February\u00a0\u00a0to test for the common illnesses(malaria and typhoid fever) and I was diagnosed with typhoid (s typhl 1:60 -1:80.) and I also tested positive for malaria. Dr put me on meds since then but I have not felt better since o started the meds (that's like 10 days ago). My tongue is still white,my throath is fine,no swollen nodes. Fever still comes and goes. No abdominal pain. The redness doesn't show anymore, I still have joint aches and I have completed the meds for big malaria and typhoid so I started panicking about my HIV exposure.Their is a history of diabetes in my family,history of high blood pressure and I have been diagnosed for acid reflux like 1 year ago. Could I have been infected during the exposure? Their were times she was on top of me and me on top of her. I am so scared now cos I can't concentrate anymore. I am trying to locate her maybe we can go get tested together. I have not achieved any major thing in my life but I have aspirations and desires which I am still pursuing but with this episodes, I can't think and I can't concentrate on anything I do.

Get tested. Help me pls....my family will be disappointed in me cos we only have each other(no father,no mother anymore).....thanks",
