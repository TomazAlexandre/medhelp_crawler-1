            "answer": "Hello,It is very difficult confirming a diagnosis but it can be boils, bedsores, pediculosis, dermatitis, pemphigus, circulatory disorders or due to diabetes. What exactly it is can be confirmed only after an examination and investigations like blood tests, clotting and bleeding profile and skin biopsy. A dermatologist\u2019s evaluation will be the best because without examination, confirmation of a diagnosis is tough.I hope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted in case you have any additional doubts. Kind regards.",
