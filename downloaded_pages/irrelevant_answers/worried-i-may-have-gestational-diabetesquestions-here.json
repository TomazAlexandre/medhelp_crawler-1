If you cant control it with your diet then you need to take the shots. Im nervous myself about this with this pregnancy. I have extreme thirst, hunger etc and Im only 8 weeks......Make sure to talk to your doctor about your concerns- hopefully its just the rough week that's making you feel that way.....good luck :)",
