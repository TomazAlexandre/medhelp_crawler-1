            "answer": "Hi,BPH is a condition that is usually seen in men over the age 0f 50.Common causes of urinary frequency include conditions such as urinary tract infections, diabetes, increased fluid consumption, urinary stones, prostate disorders, kidney disorders that affect the function of concentrating urine properly, and diseases of the urinary bladder.The most likely condition, based on your symptoms, appears to be prostatitis. It is an inflammation of the prostate gland which may be in response to infection or may be uninfective in origin. Urinalysis usually is negative in prostatitis.Flomax is a drug that acts both at the prostate and at the bladder, relaxing both organs to facilitate a smoother stream of urine which would help with the urinary frequency and urge.Some measures to help you deal with this condition include:Avoiding spicy food, caffeine, and alcohol.Avoiding sitting continuously for more than 2-3 hours.Ejaculation 1-2 times a week.Warm baths twice daily for about 10 min.\"Medications that sometimes help include the over-the-counter natural supplement saw palmetto 320 mgm daily\"en.allexperts.com/q/Urology-Male-issues-989/Unexplained-urinary-frequencyOther changes to lifestyle, such as decreasing consumption of natural diuretics like caffeine, beer, and tea, will also help.Do update us on the progress in your condition.",
