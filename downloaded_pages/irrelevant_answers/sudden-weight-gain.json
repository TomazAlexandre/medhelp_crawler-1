            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Common causes like overeating, lack of exercise, diabetes, hypothyroidism have to be ruled out in your case. You must then look for other causes. One is water retention due to low serum protein. This along with anemia can cause unexplained weight gain. Adrenal gland problems are the other cause. Cushing\u2019s syndrome should be looked for. The kidney function too should be assessed. Late night snacking and poor sleep too can cause weight gain. Polycystic ovary (in females) too causes weight gain, hence has to be ruled out by an ultrasound of abdomen.\u00a0\u00a0Certain medications like antidepressants cause weight gain.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am 39 and suddenly began to steadily gain weight in the last 2 months (20 lbs and going). One week I could wear a pair of shorts the next week could not even zip them. I have been tested for thyroid etc with blood tests and came back ok. Also have trouble getting deep breaths some times. Chest x ray was normal. I feel very tired if I am not moving. I get about 7 hours of seep at night. I feel bloated all the time and seem to have gas that I never had before. My eating habits and exercise habits have not changed. I work a very physical job never sitting for long. Also my hair is thinning. My periods and bowel movements are normal. Could this be stress or a disease I need to look into.",
