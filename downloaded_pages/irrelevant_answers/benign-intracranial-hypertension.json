            "answer": "Hi,With regards to your night blindness, i suggest you seek consult with an ophthalmologist for a complete ophthalmologic assessment.At this point it is difficult to say if the BIH and the visual symptoms are related although it may possibly be so. But a thorough evaluation of the retina and other eye structures will be able to rule out eye problems.Nutritional deficiencies, other systemic problems like hypertension or diabetes mellitus also need to be ruled out.Do keep us posted regarding your physician's advice.",
