Overweight. 250lbs.\u00a0\u00a0Diagnosed type 2 diabetic 2.5 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I have been feeling fine until about a month ago.\u00a0\u00a0I had severe bloating and burning to abdomen.\u00a0\u00a0Went to see doctor who did a complete panel including liver and pancreas enzymes.\u00a0\u00a0All normal, except h pylori which was positive. Took ten day regimen of the tetracycline/bismouth combination.\u00a0\u00a0Felt fine until about two weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0Began having burning to stomach and fullness also pain to left side and upper back.\u00a0\u00a0Prescribed protonix 40mg BID. Burning gone.\u00a0\u00a0Fullness gone.\u00a0\u00a0Pain to left side and left upper back still present and actually a little worse. I have no abdominal pain whatsoever. Every once in a while a little cramp to left side.\u00a0\u00a0I do have a decrease in appetite although that has to do with concern over the problem.\u00a0\u00a0I have lost weight, but I have been trying, so it's hard to tell if there is a correlation.\u00a0\u00a0Seeing my doc again on Tuesday.\u00a0\u00a0I f my amylase and lipase as well as liver enzymes were normal a month ago, could this be pancreatic in nature?\u00a0\u00a0I am worried because of my diabetes diagnosis 2.5 years ag and no family history.\u00a0\u00a0Just very scared and nervous.\u00a0\u00a0Essentially, no issues except side and back pain",
