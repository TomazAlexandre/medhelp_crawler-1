    "question": "Male 45 UK (100 kilo) currently dieting. Family history of Diabetes.Hope i am posting this in the right place, i have tried to post in the doctors forums, but cannot seem to get a space.I would be grateful for your thoughts on my symptoms and if in your opinions they suggest MS.I am overweight and have been since giving up smoking 5 years ago but i am now on a strict diet and exercise program. I mention this as i am not sure if it has a connection and i am aware that being overweight can cause numbness in the legs. However these symptoms did start well before the weight gain and are not confined to my legs.Approx. 12 years ago i developed a small patch just above my right knee that went sort of numb. Both legs are now equally affected and are permanently like this.\u00a0\u00a0This small patch has developed into a larger patch and now stretches from my knee upwards about 10\"\u00a0\u00a0on front and outer sides of legs. I would describe it more as a loss of sensation. I also get occasional tingling, burning and a feeling of rippling. I have no problem walking but i do have muscle aches in the legs or cramps as though i have run a marathon, these are worse after sitting for a time. The burning and rippling can occur at any time, resting or otherwise. The other problem i have is with my hands/arms. I am an artist and am constantly using my hands and have muscle aches in these areas. Depending on the size of the item i am holding i get pains in my fingers if the item is small or wrists and forearms if bigger. These pains happen approx. 75% of the time. Things like carving a joint of meat are painful or repetitive tasks. As an example last week i needed to tear a small strip off about 20 greetings cards to create a jagged edge and this was causing pain to my fingers.Other things which come and go are headaches, ringing in ear with loud music, and what i can only describe as awkward hand writing as though it is not a natural thing to do. Also the occasional loss of concentration, but maybe thats just me.My google search indicated Diabetes or MS. I have recently tested negative for Diabetes.Any advice appreciated, I have not asked for a medical opinion on this as yet.Thanks\u00a0\u00a0in advance for any comments",
