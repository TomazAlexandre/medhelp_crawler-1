With \"nerve\" it's meant a net of nerves within the colonic wall, and in different cases, this net may be more or less affected. You may want to search for \"megacolon\" or \"Hirschsprung's disease\".http://health.yahoo.com/digestive-overview/hirschsprung-s-disease-topic-overview/healthwise--hw183348.htmlhttp://www.emedicine.com/med/topic1016.htm",

            "answer": "Yes, it's kind a... like let's say in diabetes: you may have insulin deficiency of different extent, but you still have diabetes. Beside that, various lenght of the colon may lack ganglion cells in different cases.But to stop with guessing: As I understand, biopsy of the colon was made, now the gastroenterologist should say if this megacolon is from Hirschprung's disease or not. It may be some other nerve or muscular or other congenital disorder.Here's one more appropriate article:http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic1417.htmScroll down to \"causes of congenital megacolon\"",

    "question": "My 1 year old is severely constipated. He has enourmous stools. He has a severe iron deficiency else well. He went for a colonoscopy where he has been diagnosed with a mega colon. The pediatric surgen (who only saw the x-rays) and ignored the colonoscopy report indicated that there is nothing wrong with my baby and only need 'pedicol'. He has been using this pedicol for 1 week. His tummy does go more often, but he has severe stomach cramps. Please advise. The biopsy report did indicate that there is nerve situated at the lower part of the colon. The pediatric surgen claim that the iron deficiency is due to to much formula milk. He drinks about 500-750ml milk per day. Please advise.",
