    "question": "yesterday I woke up and felt fine... A few hours later i ate lunch while talking with a friend... While eating lunch I took some Coca Cola down the wrong pipe..coughed a few times and moved on.. a few hours after that I began having discomfort while breathing deeply. I am feel alot of soreness in the muscles on each side of my neck.. When i swallow my thought duesnt hurt but the muscles used in the process feel very sore..The discomfort breathing also varies depending onthe position my body is in... Much less laying down sideways.. much more laying down flat on my back and standing....For some reason i think i might have felt a little discomfort in my neck and chest earlier in the day before i had lunch...but im not sure... I really dont feel sick....I also feel alot of discomfort when the air from a burb moves through my throat area... If ibreath in small normal breaths i dont really feel to much discomfort ..it is when i take deep breath that really expand my chest that i feel discomfort in the top of my chest.... I have had this now for more than 16 hours... I have no history of Asthma... do not smoke or drink. I do have lots of lower back pain from time to time though.Any suggestions...help or reccomendations are greatly appreciated..Happy HolidaysJaz... - NMI",
