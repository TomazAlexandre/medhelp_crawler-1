            "answer": "Thanks for replying.Low carb is mostly fish, meat and veggies.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of eggs and cheese & veggie omelet. On Sat. I had pizza my BG topped at 145 and stayed above 125 for 4 hrs.I am tracking my FBG for June and July then I will visit my doctor again.\u00a0\u00a0At that time I will request to be put on Metformin if I don't see improvement or find another cause.I was hoping someone on here might have a suggestion of other causes for the high FBG.",

            "answer": "Hello,sounds like your low carb diet is being well followed.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, even with great attention to diet and exericise and even weight loss diabetes may still progress.Most important is to control your blood sugar and keep it as close to normal as you can.At this point with an a1c of 6.2 your average blood sugar is somewhere around 140, this is well above the normal range which is less than 5 (average blood sugar typically < 100).Given you are doing all you reasonably can with lifestyle, I think you should be trying metformin.\u00a0\u00a0IF metformin doesn't drop your blood sugars (you should see maximum effect within about 2 weeks of taking it), then you should request to be referred to an endocrinologist.In such case you should be assessed (antibody tests) to see what type of diabetes you have.\u00a0\u00a0Type 2, or adult onselt type 1 (sometimes referred to as LADA).\u00a0\u00a0If you have type 2, medications may be appropriate, but if you have adult onset type 1, typically the most appropriate medication can be a very low dose of insulin, which by normalizing blood sugars and thus delay progression of diabetes.I can recommend the book \"diabetes Solutions\", but Dr. Richard Berstein.\u00a0\u00a0It has great info on the low carb side as well as on medication options.\u00a0\u00a0[He does recommend use of sugar alternatives / artificial sweeteners, which I strongly disagree with / I think better to avoid both sugar and artificial sweeteners.\u00a0\u00a0But other than that I think his advice and approach is worth considering].",

    "question": "Over several years my FBG numbers have been in the 100 to 116 range.\u00a0\u00a0Six months ago my A1c was 6.2 then it was retested in June and again it was 6.2. My doctor says this means I do not have diabetes.Since the beginning of June I have tried to lose weight and have been checking my FBG every morning.\u00a0\u00a0After 1 1/2 months of low carb dieting my FBG is getting worse.\u00a0\u00a0The last six days FBG has been between 127 and 141.Another confusion for me is that I don't have spikes in BG during the day.\u00a0\u00a0I have tested 1hr, 1&1/2 hrs. and 2hrs after eating and I never go above 145.\u00a0\u00a0However, if I eat a regular carb meal my BG will spike at 145 and then stay above 125 for 3 or 4 hrs.I have not had one BG test below 100 since I started testing in June.What should I do or What can be done about this?",
