            "answer": "Before I talk about depresion which can definitely effect speech, Im going to say there are a lot of serious neurological causes of speech problems; if this is a possibiity you must get it checked. Drowsiness caused by alcohol, drugs or chemicl problems like diabetes and salt imbalance can make you slur your words. Strokes and other brain \"injuries\" can effect the way you find words or form them, this may be accompanied by other neurological symptoms; weakness in one part of the body or drooping face etc.For me, when I was first suffering from major depression, I was very aware of the effects on my speech..sometimes a whole sentence was too much effort and I'd give up half way, finding the right words was an enormous effort and I would stutter and crack as I tried to speak. I was reassured by others that I didn't sound as bad as it felt but I was definitely aware that my talking wasn't as good as normal. Sometimes I'd try to say something but \"treacle brain\", as I call it, wasn't quick enough to keep up with normal speech and I'd flounder and often give up. Not sure I ever slurred so much as stuttered and stammered. Slurring may be a side effect of tranquilisers (antipyschotics) and anxyiolytics (mostly the benzodiapines; all tend to end in ...azepam)\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps. Once again if this is a sudden, new development and not obviously explained by depression you should see a doctor to be certain you're not mislabelling something else.Good luck, x",

            "answer": "Hey Tom,Sounds like what I call \"treacle brain\" and in my case started before I had any meds on board so was definitely a symptom of my depression, worse under stress or when sleep deprived and then definitely not helped by using a benzodiazepine/anti anxiety (such as your xanax) Have you been offered the chance to see a counsellor or therapist..often schools and colleges have one available to students...it may be that feelings are confused in your head making thought processes slow down ...don't ask me how but talking treatments do help. Also make sure your doctor knows you are still struggling..he/she may review you and change things; the lepraxo can increase to 20mgs if it hasn't helped after a number of weeks and side effects not an issue.The other important thing, Tom,\u00a0\u00a0is to make sure you look after yourself properly. Good varied diet, fresh air, excercise, mixing with other people, plenty of rest when you can etc. etc.\u00a0\u00a0it all sounds obvious but we so easily forget and can be better at caring for cars/pets than ourselves..it's worth a thought. And obviously, avoid alcohol or anything stronger!Hope this helps, take care\u00a0\u00a0x",
