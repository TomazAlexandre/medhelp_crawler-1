            "answer": "It sounds like he was having what is called an Absent Seizure. Anyone can have a seizure at anytime and the doctors can not find any rhyme or reason for it. But since he did suffer one, the odds of him having another one do increase. Now I am not saying he will, I am just saying that he might. The thing that is more concerning to me is the amount of time he was having the seizure. I wish you the best of luck.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the response.I am so confused.\u00a0\u00a0Some aspects of it make me think absence, like you said, and others make me think partial complex.In the end, I just want him to be okay.\u00a0\u00a0I sleep with him nightly ever since this happened.\u00a0\u00a0I don't even hit the gym myself.\u00a0\u00a0Something I did to prevent diabetes.Now, I just spend every free minute with him.\u00a0\u00a0I can't wait for neurologist appointment.My wife and I have recounted that day, and did notice that he didn't nap like usual and didn't eat much.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps that brought it on.My sister, when she was maybe 3ish, ran out the house to play with us without having breakfast or anything and fainted/convulsed once.\u00a0\u00a0But that was only once.So maybe this was a one time thing with my little man?",

            "answer": "Thank you, Flipper.I know I'm asking for something no one can give me, the answers as to if this will ever happen again, but I just want to make sure he's okay.I kept him awake until midnight last night, and then woke him up at 5am to prep for his EEG.\u00a0\u00a0It was performed at 11am.\u00a0\u00a0He slept through it for 40 minutes.Next we have an MRI scheduled and then we speak to the neurologist.They also put an annoying strobe light in his face for 5 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0It did not induce a seizure.",

    "question": "My son suffered a seizure 8hrs ago.\u00a0\u00a0He's 2.5years old.We were having a normal day, and he followed me into the kitchen.\u00a0\u00a0If offered him some raspberries and noticed he kept looking up.\u00a0\u00a0He was standing, taking steps, but had a dazed look on his face as his eyes were looking up.\u00a0\u00a0I thought he spotted something but there were only cabinets.I then began to talk to him cause that was out of the ordinary, and noticed he wasn't really conscience.\u00a0\u00a0Yelled for my wife to call 911, and laid him down in the living room.He didnt have convulsions.\u00a0\u00a0He actually moved his arms and even legs at times as if he was coming back.\u00a0\u00a0This broke my heart so much to see him like this.It took 10 minutes for the ambulance to arrive and it lasted another 10 minutes or so after.\u00a0\u00a0He was breathing the whole time.\u00a0\u00a0At one point he blinked nonstop.\u00a0\u00a0His face spasmed at other times too.The convulsive behavior didn't really happen but the closest thing to it occurred when they gave him oxygen in the ambulance.\u00a0\u00a0He moved and jerked.\u00a0\u00a0Then it stopped.I have seen seizures before and this was a less dramatic, yet longer lasting seizure.\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact, my initial thoughts weren't even seizure.\u00a0\u00a0It was the medical staff that jumped to that conclusion.Neither I nor my wife have a history of epilepsy in our family.\u00a0\u00a0The baby didn't have anything to have provoked it.\u00a0\u00a0No fever or anything.Two hours before he was hitting his head on the floor because he was frustrated his little iPad lost battery.\u00a0\u00a0But the CT-Scan came back fine.\u00a0\u00a0The bloodwork also came back fine.He's a healthy baby boy.\u00a0\u00a0Very smart.\u00a0\u00a0Little bit speech delayed but otherwise extremely intelligent.\u00a0\u00a0I mean, he has an iPad and navigates it like a teen.\u00a0\u00a0You should see it.What are the chances that this is going to happen again?",
