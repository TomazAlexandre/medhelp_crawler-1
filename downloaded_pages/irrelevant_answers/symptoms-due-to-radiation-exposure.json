            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!No, these tests and procedures would not have caused the radiation exposure that would have harmed your health.Lethargy can be due to low thyroid function, diabetes and anemia too. Drink plenty of fluids and take a multivitamin pill for some days. Originally why were you being tested for heart problems? What were the symptoms then---maybe they are the clue to your diagnosis.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thanks for replying back.I was tested for my heart because of syncopal episodes and some chest discomfort.I admit i do have stress in my life at the moment with a sick family member.I went to the gp today and he wants me to do some lung function tests because of ongoing dyspnea that I have been having.I feel so frustrated at not knowing what is wrong with me!!! I used to be full of energy and now feel run down most days.Do you think any other tests should be ordered?thanks again,Regards,Dimi.",

    "question": "In 2007 I had a nuclear stress test that was positive for ischaemia.Then I had a64 slice ct heart scan which was then followed by a cath.In the end no problems were found with my heart.Ever since then I have felt lethargic and feel that something is not right with my body.have I over exposed my self with too much radiation?Could this be causing my symptoms.my doctor assures me that I just have anxiety and that is causing me to feel this way.I am worried sick that all this radiation exposure may have damaged my health.Please advise.",
