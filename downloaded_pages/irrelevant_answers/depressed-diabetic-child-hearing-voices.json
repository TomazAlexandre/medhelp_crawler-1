            "answer": "Dear Marjorie,I can only imagine how worried you must be about your son.\u00a0\u00a0Managing an 11 year old who is diabetic can be stressful enough without worrying about his mental state.\u00a0\u00a0Those of us who have had diabetes since childhood know that it can cause depression, anger and a host of other turbulent emotions.\u00a0\u00a0Having a chronic illness, especially as a child, is not easy.\u00a0\u00a0Every child is different and it can be harder for some than for others.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like your child is having a particularly difficult time. Whenever anyone talks about suicide, it is cause for an immediate response.\u00a0\u00a0I would recommend taking your child to a therapist who is experienced in working with depressed children as soon as possible.\u00a0\u00a0His school counselor or doctor may have some names to recommend.\u00a0\u00a0I would also alert the school counselor to what is going on so that he/she can keep an eye on him during the day and maybe provide him with a little extra attention.\u00a0\u00a0Depression is nothing to take lightly.\u00a0\u00a0Although most diabetics have dificult days and may experience some mood swings, talking about suicide is not what you would normally expect.\u00a0\u00a0A good psychological evaluation is in order to rule out any seriuos problems and to help him get through this difficult period.In the meantime, being a perfectionist is the blessing and the curse for diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0Good self care demands a little perfectionism, but unfortunately , even with perfect management, diabetes can have a mind of its own.\u00a0\u00a0This can be particularly frustraing to a child who is trying so hard to do everything right and his blood sugars may still not be perfect. We have no control over so many factors that contribute to blood sugar control and that can be infuriating.\u00a0\u00a0You can help him by reassuring him that you know he is doing the best he can and that there are things that no one can control.\u00a0\u00a0He may also be frightened about what might happen to him if he has high blood sugars one day.\u00a0\u00a0An extra dose of reassurance, caring and support support may be what he needs rihg now.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to contact your local JDRF chapter to see if there are any support groups both for him and for you.\u00a0\u00a0Hearing from others who share the same struggles and challenges that you are both facing can be comforting and also help you both gain some new ideas and perspectives.I know that things can get better and I encourage you to get the help you need to help you son.\u00a0\u00a0Please let us know how things go.Es",

            "answer": "If you haven't arranged this already, this child needs a psychological evaluation immediately. The fact that the child is diabetic is secondary at this point.Parents will probably post and give some suggestions regarding their experiences, but I think everyone would agree that this is outside the realm of a normal variant of adaptation to a chronic disease.Please seek out help for your child if you have not already done so.",

            "answer": "Great advice shared already and altho' none of us is a physician, we speak from experience with diabetes.Suicide talk is cry ... if not a moaning ... for help.If you're lucky enough to live near a large city, you might find a psychiatrist who specialized in pediatrics, especially depression associated with chronic illness.\u00a0\u00a0Your son's depression might (not) be directly related to diabetes, but as was pointed out diabetes management is fraught with \"control\" issues.\u00a0\u00a0We hvae some, we don't have all we need or would like.Many 11 year olds, as 6th graders, are just beginning at a \"new\" big middle school, where they are suddenly small, sometimes ridiculed, and often feel insecure after being the \"big kids\" at their elementary school.\u00a0\u00a0In many areas their school includes 8th graders who are so very different and can be so intimidating to the 6th graders.\u00a0\u00a0So, depressoin could be rooted in school issues, too.Be lovingly attentive to your boy, afford him safe opportunities to share what's aching his heart.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps thru music or art or some other activity that he used to enjoy, you can begin to reach him while you're awaiting your appointment.\u00a0\u00a0Do tell the doc's office that being seen is *urgent* however.",

            "answer": "Hearing voices is NOT a normal sign of depression, and could be a symptom of a very treatable disorder. Please take your son to a mental health care professional immediately. While some depression can be related to the highs and lows in blood sugar that all diabetics face, and of course some depression can be caused by being a kid and walking the diabetic control tightrope, the fact that you write that he is occasionally hearing voices makes me very concerned that he may have another mental health issue entirely. Don't blame this on his diabetes, but insist on finding out what is wrong with him. I have a son-in-law with bipolar disorder, and he heard voices when young. Also, folks who deal with schizophrenia can hear voices. Both of these conditions are treatable, so please get this boy some help!",
