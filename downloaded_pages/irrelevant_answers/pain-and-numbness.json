    "question": "hi, im a teenager of age 16 who suffer from a left testicle pain about a month ago. i took a visit to the doctor after 4 continously days with the pain. The doctor took me a urine test which i came out clean in. He also gave me some antibiotics to take. The pain did go away however, after a week i started feeling pain on the left bottom side of the head of my penis and where the penis starts. The pain on my penis would always come when i got exited. After a few days I also started noticing that da top of my penis and the left side of my penis was completely numb, no sensation at all. So i took a visit to the emergency\u00a0\u00a0doctor which was a different doctorand they gave me more anti biotics for urine track infection. Now here iam after a week or two feeling the same pain everytime i get exited and i notice a discomfort on my testicles everytime i ejaculate, like a warm feeling .. and my penis is still feeling numb so i hard for me to exited now. I also got tested for std's and everything came out clean so i feel like maybe the doctors are given me the wrong anti biotic for my problem and im becoming depress over this situation. Anybody have an answer to my problem? please help !",
