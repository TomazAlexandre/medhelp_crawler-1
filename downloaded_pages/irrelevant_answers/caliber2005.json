            "answer": "Hi Burgio,Have you posted any comments for your previous post regarding RSD?Sensory dysfunction involves two types of symptoms: \u201cnegative\u201d and \u201cpositive\u201d sensory phenomena. A negative sensory phenomenon is an expression of a deficit of sensory function such as loss of warm or cold sensation or hypalgesia. However, patients rarely recognize these deficits, and because of the protective role of nociceptors, such deficits frequently lead to painless, repetitive traumatic lesions such as those occurring in the hands among patients with syringomyelia or in the feet of diabetics.A positive sensory phenomenon is an expression of an abnormally increased function of the sensory system, such as paresthesias or neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain may be spontaneous or stimulus induced.Spontaneous pain may have a burning quality, usually referred to the skin, when it is the expression of discharges of the peripheral C nociceptors. Such pain may be sharp when it is caused by excitation of small myelinated A-delta nociceptive cutaneous afferents. Electric-like shooting pains, radiating to a limb segment or the face, are usually the result of the generation of ectopic impulses in the nociceptive pathways.Do you feel pain to warm and cold sensations? Do you feel pain mostly in your legs and hands mainly palm?Have you got asymmetrical numbness? Do you have color change at the site of pain on exposure to warm and cold sensations?Sensory nerve damage causes numbness, tingling, pain along the distribution of nerve which is affected.Have you tried Vitamin B12 supplementation?What has the doctor got to say about all this?Hope this helps.Happy holidays to you and your family.Bye.",

            "answer": "Hi Burgio,Yes, physical therapy will work.When we have tingling and numbness, we tend to use our hand less which leads to muscle atrophy.Physical therapy will work in preventing atrophy of muscles. It is not going to help the nerve in any way.Nerves which are less severely damaged and which are outside the spine will regrow again at the rate of 1mm/day.Have you been tested for sugars? Do you have diabetes?I feel either you have Diabetic Polyneuropathy, or traumatic and entrapment neuropathies.Have you suffered any trauma to that site before?",
