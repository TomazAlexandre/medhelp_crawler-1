            "answer": "It sounds like you have an answer and you are not a hypochondriac - you have elevated prolactin.You have a defined tumor (do you know the size - I advise you to go get the report and MRI so you have your records as well have all your labs too).As for the heart issues, I addressed this is another post. The same meds are often used to treat other things and cab is used to treat parkinsons. At the levels to treat pituitary tumors, which is usually lower and a few times a week, the risk is also a lot lower than the doses for other disorders who need higher levels of the medications - but they have to black box it for everyone. Still, if you have a heart issue, it would pay to watch. Your doc should be watching and talk to your pharmacist about it as well.Once your levels get down and that can take a while, you should feel better and hopefully that will lessen your anxiety.Do you know what type of tumor your grandfather had?",

    "question": "I met with my neuro Endo who specializes in pituitary 3 days ago after being diagnosed with a growth on my pit.My symptoms were anxiety on and off for 3 years. Then 2 years noticed my libido was low. Lack of erections etc. anxiety went away and then a year later came back. Got testosterone test. It was low but in normal range. Went again in November and testosterone was low and prolactin super high like 2000I decided to go back for the hormone retest after I was having bad anxiety and my sleep pattern was very off and minor headache behind my eye on and off and muscle aches. Shrinking testesI had convinced my self I had ms then Lyme because I had Lyme as a kid but got treated.Everyone on Lyme forums said it was lyme. My grand father had a pit tumor and I finally had an MRI that diagnosed me with the pit tumor. The doc recommended taking the cabergoline over surgery.I read the side effects and I'm scared that they said something about heart valve? It scares me. I need to start taking it tonight. I usually never had any side effects from meds I took.Then I worry about diabetes because I had my testosterone flip flopping and read online low t can lead to diabetes if not treated. I am a hypochondriac and read online so much into everything. It's a cold fall here and my mouth gets a little dry and the anxiety sets me off. my teeth ache every once in a while.I just want to feel like myself again instead of thinking im dying everyday.",
