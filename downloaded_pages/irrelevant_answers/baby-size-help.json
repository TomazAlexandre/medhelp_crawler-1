It can sometimes be difficult to pin point. For example... my mother had three separate due dates for me. See if that could be possible.",

            "answer": "I really wouldn't worry,US can b way off in the later stages of pregnancy. Ive seen on here many times women being told they are having big babies n be induced at like 38 weeks only for the baby to be 6 or 7 lbs.Where I am from its not routine to offer US after 20 weeks due to this fact. When I got pregnant with my first i had a low BMI so I was given growth scans (to check baby wasnt small) at 28 n 34 weeks. Baby measured big on both but my dr was very dismissive. She said not only could the ultrasound be off but also babies grow at different rates n have growth spurts then slow down so even if my baby was big then doesn't mean she will be at birth. As it happened she was big, 9lb 6! But I had a natural birth n I'm tiny! Nothing I did or ate made her big,some women just have big babies. I'm now on my second n he feels like he could be even bigger! I'm not scared this time tho as I know my body will handle it fine.",
