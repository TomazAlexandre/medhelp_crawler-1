And I'm not shaming her to try to get her to change or stop using. The fact that she did it and it's been done.. proves she does not put that baby before drugs.. She obviously knew what she was doing and how can anyone not think that would affect the baby.. Selfish! But yes she sure does have mental probs and should not be trusted with a baby.. Hopefully the doctors find out and I'm sure they wouldn't just let it go.. If they do find out I'm sure she'll be monitored or something. Which she should be!\u00a0\u00a0This really gets to me bc there are women out there who would do anything to be able to have and love their own baby but can't get pregnant.. and then there's people like this.. Who knowingly put their babies lives in real jeopardy with their selfish acts.",

            "answer": "Cocaine back then and meth in this day and age are so far apart it's like comparing apples to sea lions. My cousin used meth while pregnant in every pregnancy and lost all her children but the last. The worst was her first, who had issues the moment she was born and still does and she's 6, and she had to go through detox herself. The next also had to be rid of the drugs but was less effected because the mother was sent to jail halfway through the pregnancy. Her last child she stopped using in the first trimester because she was imprisoned for the remaining 7months. That baby also got tested and came back positive with the drug still in his system but low enough she got to keep that one as she herself went through rehab while in prison. She then got tested randomly and regularly whenever the courts demanded for a year in order for her to keep that baby. Good luck to your friend. I don't care if she has a mental disease. If what you say is true and she hasn't touched it since then I'd bet she doesn't really have a true mental disease and is just weak minded. She doesn't deserve that baby regardless if she knew she was pregnant or not and took the drug. And I believe the same for my cousin. 3 kids, 2 in foster care and she has one. Her obgyn needs to know regardless of anything else. That baby may have issues or may need to go through detox itself and she needs to start making better decisions now and one of them is tattle on herself to ensure her baby will get the best care from this point on.",

But from now till then she hasn't done anything and doesn't plan on using anything anymore! EVER! Will that one time cause her to lose her child? Will the child be okay? and Will they be able to detect that one time use in any drug tests or baby's system?",
