            "answer": "Ah i finally found you. took me forever to go thru the threads to find this area. I actually found another amazing site which has helped me greatly. Im now post op day 8!! from Anterior Cervical Fusion of C5-6. I have titan. rods and screws and donor bone.Surgery was very surprisingly not as bad as i expected. i had no real pain ( was on morphine pump LOL) and it didnt even compare to the pain i went thru with the disk beforehand. The surgery initially has taken away most of my problems but i had a bad nite last nite with numbness.I saw the NS and two weeks later i was in. If you would like to know what the other site is send me a message and ill give you the link. I dont think they would like me advertising for other sites on here..lol",

            "answer": "Glad to hear from you both. Good going Phenom, so glad you are getting better. Don't try to do too much too soon. It took about 3 weeks for my nerves to start \"waking up\". So don't be surprised if you start hurting more.\u00a0\u00a0Still have a lot of muscle pain, the big one on right side that runs fromskull down side of neck to collar bone, and my fingers on left hand still somewhat numb. But I also have carpal tunnel, so hard to tell without EMG if I have gained strength back yet. I had started to walk a mile a day, at approx 5 weeks after surgery, but it caused my partial-tear in achilles tendon pain to flare up, so can't do that. Had been swimming about 3x's a week, but too cold now. I am so glad to hear from you both! Just too much arthritis, and diabetes, and fibromyalgia, to ever recover as much as I'd like. But at least the severe neck pain is gone. Don't regret the surgery at all.",

    "question": "Dr appnt went well today, fusing but slowly due to diabetes. Don't have to go back, unless the T8 and L4-5 totally herniate. Hope to avoid that. Pain is residual (he thinks) as my muscles adjust to having part of my neck stiff. Driving for 8 hrs a day doesn't help. But will continue to swim and walk. He also gave me exercises to improve core strenght for lower back. Hope you are all doing well....Phon, how are you doing? Have you seen neurosurgeion yet? When is surgery? Let us know.",
