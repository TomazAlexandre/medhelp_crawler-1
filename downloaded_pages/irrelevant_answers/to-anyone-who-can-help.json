            "answer": "Hi!Thanks Shinty!Hiaquaman444Strange though it may sound, Keppra can cause bruising, muscle weakness and spasm or pains. Hence, this cause should be ruled out first. The other possibility is an electrolyte imbalance caused by blood pressure medications, especially diuretics. So, if you are on them, please inform your cardiologist.Other than this diabetes and thyroid disorders should be ruled out. Do discuss this with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
