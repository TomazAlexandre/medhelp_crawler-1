            "answer": "HiI suggest that you have this assessed by a neurologist for a complete physical and neurologic examination. Visual symptoms with headaches may have a migraine with aura and transient ischemic attacks as differentials. It is necessary to have a baseline scan or MRI done. A localized eye problem is also a differential .However, this may be considered once cerebrovascular factors have been excluded.Does your husband have any underlying risk factors like diabetes and hypertension?",

            "answer": "I guess I'm also wondering if it's the kind of thing that can wait... maybe until/if it happens again or he has any other symptoms, or at least for a while?We are soon (in a couple of weeks) going on a trip, which has been planned and excitedly anticipated for a couple of years now.\u00a0\u00a0It is probably the only chance we'll have to do this as it is a specialist trip organised through a course we take.\u00a0\u00a0We will be away for a couple of weeks, and it doesn't involve flying or driving ourselves- we are on a bus- or leaving the country (Australia).\u00a0\u00a0We will be going to some out of the way places, but not into the real outback or that far from potential medical assistance, due to our Flying Doctor Service (which we have cover for, as well as ambulance) or ambulance, if either was needed.Starting the process of looking into this could well conflict with the time of the trip.So... is it likely to be something serious and of immediate concern, or could we *wait and see*?\u00a0\u00a0I know you can't really give definite advice as to what it is, but what would your feeling be?Thank you.",
