            "answer": "Her Free T3 is slightly below midpoint of the range.\u00a0\u00a0This can sometimes be associated with hypothyroidism, because the range is far too broad.\u00a0\u00a0Many of our members, myself included, report that symptom relief for them required that FT3 was adjusted into the upper part of its range and FT4 adjusted to around the midpoint of its range.\u00a0\u00a0 Not clear if you are looking for treatment for your mom, or just to understand if she is truly hypo.The answer to the question of being hypothyroid or not has to start with whether hypo symptoms are present.\u00a0\u00a0This is a good link for you and your family to go through and determine that.http://thyroid.about.com/cs/basics_starthere/a/hypochecklist.htmIf hypo symptoms are apparent, then testing should be done for The thyroid antibodies, TPO ab and TG ab, to see if Hashimoto's Thyroiditis is pressent.\u00a0\u00a0Hashi's is the most common cause of hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, testing should go beyond TSH and include the biologically active thyroid hormones, Free T3 and Free T4.\u00a0\u00a0 TSH is so variable that it is inadequate as a diagnostic for thyroid issues, so don't ever let a doctor stop with that or medicate you based on TSH alone.\u00a0\u00a0Patients that are suspect as hypo also should be tested for Vitamin D, B12, iron/ferritin, zinc, selenium, and RBC magnesium.Sometimes doctors use \"Reference Range Endocrinology\" and will tell you that if a thyroid test falls anywhere within the reference range, that is adequate.\u00a0\u00a0That is also wrong.\u00a0\u00a0The ranges are far too broad,for reasons I won't get into right now.\u00a0\u00a0FT3 and FT4 need to be high enough in their range to relieve any hypo symptoms.Going to an Endo does not guarantee a good thyroid doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Many specialize in diabetes, and many others have the \"Immaculate TSH Belief\", or use \"reference Range Endocrinology\" and the patient suffers.\u00a0\u00a0What you need most would be a good thyroid doctor.\u00a0\u00a0By that I mean one that will treat clinically by testing and adjusting Free T3 and Free T4 as necessary to relieve symptoms, without being constrained by resultant TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0Symptom relief should be all important, not just test results.If you want more insight into clinical treatment, this is a link to a letter written by a good thyroid doctor for patients that he sometimes consults with from a distance.\u00a0\u00a0The letter is sent to the PCP of the patient to ehlp guide treatment.http://hormonerestoration.com/files/ThyroidPMD.pdfIf your doctors don't qualify as good thyroid doctors and you need help locating one,\u00a0\u00a0if you will tell us your location, perhaps a member could recommend one, based on personal experience.",

    "question": "I recentley had my mothers thyroid checked tsh, ft3, and ft4 the doctor said its all came back normal... I almost know she has a thyr imbalance because of symptoms she has exper her whole life, shes 79 yrs. I'm meeting with dr. at the nursing home Thursday.\u00a0\u00a0My question is what else can be checked?\u00a0\u00a0Her symptoms..depressed her whole life, early menopause 40 yrs old, started loosing hair at 30 yrs old dementia diagnosis at 67 has progressed into Alzheimers,\u00a0\u00a0developed diabetes recently. I need to know for my daughters sakes if this runs in the family? Her sister had half thyr out 25 yrs ago, 2 of her daughters same story no cancer in their cases, in my case after the birth of my 3rd child thyro nodual, papl cancer, complete thyr removed, on 150 of synthryoid. I had a cough my whole pregnancy and shortness of breath heart palpitations get this!! my thyroid blood work came back normal... this was done after the birth when I noticed the nodual how can that be?? I think thats why most thyroid problems are over looked! pcp don't know what to look for in my case I had a nodual so even though my blood work came back normal I was sent for a scan ultrasound and biopsy whats the answer for all these millions of people going to the Drs with all these symptoms and thyroid is over looked?? I do know you need to go straight to a endocrinologist.",
