            "answer": "I'm sorry to tell you that there is no cure for Hashimoto's.\u00a0\u00a0It's an autoimmune disease in which the body sees the thyroid as foreign and produces antibodies to destroy it.\u00a0\u00a0The antibodies destroy thyroid tissue, so it gradually produces less and less thyroid hormones, leaving the patient with hypothyroidism.Once you develop hypothyroidism, your doctor will prescribe you some type of thyroid replacement medication.\u00a0\u00a0As long as your levels are at a good place for you, there's no reason you can't have babies.An underlying problem with PCOS is a hormonal imbalance. Women with PCOS make more androgens than normal, which affects development and release of eggs during ovulation.\u00a0\u00a0High insuln levels may also be linked to PCOS, which in turn causes higher androgen levels.Are you on medication for either hypothyroidism or PCOS?\u00a0\u00a0Hypothyroidism would be treated with, most likely, some type of T4, levothyroxine medication.\u00a0\u00a0PCOS is often treated with metformin, which helps lower insulin levels.If you\u00a0\u00a0have current thyroid hormone labs, please post them, for us, so we can see your status.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to include reference ranges, which vary lab to lab and have to come from your own report.",

            "answer": "Of course, anyone, especially those with an insulin issue, should choose a low glycemic diet, which is one that centers on foods that don't spike blood glucose levels, which, in turn, spikes insulin levels.\u00a0\u00a0The high glycemic foods tend to be those containing sugar, and other simple carbs that break down/are digested quickly.\u00a0\u00a0Complex carbs (such as vegetable and whole grains), on the other hand, do not spike blood sugar and should be eaten freely.\u00a0\u00a0 It should be noted that fat can also increase insulin levels when eaten in excess.Any dietary change for the better is always a good thing, but anyone planning to \"cure\" Hashimoto's via diet, supplements, etc will end up being very disappointed.",

            "answer": "I too heard about a high fat diet as a cause of insulin resistance and I'd say I'd agree with that if it was a high transfat diet since that man made fat is replacing the saturated fat in the cell membranes and causing havoc with glucose getting into the cells.But there are various low carb high fat diets such as Atkins, LCHF, Ketogenic, Paleo and if any of these diets saw insulin rise then you wouldn't be losing weight any time soon!\u00a0\u00a0The Swedish government recognises the LCHF diet (based on a 2 year review of 16,000 nutrition studies) as suitable for type 2 diabetes, improving heart health markers, weight loss or maintaining weight.",

            "answer": "I'm not sure it really matters whether it's trans fat or not, though we all know that trans fat is bad for us, in any amount (one molecule from being plastic... eewww).\u00a0\u00a0From what I've been reading, the jury is still out on the high fat diet.\u00a0\u00a0Mercola is the only one I've seen, recently, who really pushes it.\"Fat has little, if any, effect on blood glucose levels, although a high fat intake does appear to contribute to insulin resistance.\"Then there's this, by a diabetes expert:\"Pizza. A hot fudge sundae. Movie theater popcorn. Cheesesteaks wit (hey, I\u2019m a Philly guy).What do they all have in common? More than being mighty tasty, they\u2019re also loaded with fat. Fat doesn\u2019t usually receive a whole lot of attention from those on intensive insulin programs; carbs seem to get all the glory. And deservedly so: Carbs cause a rapid rise in blood glucose, while fat seems to have little effect. Or does it?You may have noticed that your blood glucose level rises overnight after a restaurant meal. Or perhaps it climbs excessively in the evening after having a big piece of birthday cake during the day. The culprit is most likely the fat content of these types of meals and snacks, not the carbohydrates.It has long been known that adding fat to a meal will slow down the digestion/absorption of carbohydrates. This is due to a slowdown in gastric emptying \u2013 the rate at which food passes from the stomach into the intestines, where the nutrients (such as glucose) are absorbed into the bloodstream. This is why the carbohydrates in high-fat meals tend to take longer to raise the blood glucose level. But the difference is generally an hour or two: Whereas a low-fat meal will raise the blood glucose level quickly (usually within an hour), a high-fat meal may take two to four hours to produce a blood sugar peak.So what about after the carbohydrates are finished doing their thing? That\u2019s when the fat itself begins to exert its effects. The process goes something like this:You eat a high-fat meal or snack (this is the fun part).In a few hours, the fat begins to digest; this continues for several hours.The level of fat in the bloodstream (triglycerides) rises.High triglycerides in the bloodstream cause the liver to become resistant to insulin.When the liver is insulin resistant, it produces and secretes more glucose than usual.The blood glucose rises steadily as the liver\u2019s glucose output goes up.This is what causes the gradual, delayed blood glucose rise after consumption of large amounts of fat. The response seems to be \u201cdose-dependent\u201d \u2013 the more fat you consume, the more insulin resistant the liver becomes, and the more glucose it produces. The type of fat also appears to play a role. Saturated fats (the type found in dairy and animal products) seem to cause more insulin resistance than monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (the type found in vegetable products).So what can be done about it? The obvious answer is to cut back on portions of fatty foods, and choose foods containing healthier types of fats. But when confronted with your favorite culinary indulgence from time to time, you can still partake and manage your blood glucose level reasonably well.\"It seems that no matter which camp one sits in, on the matter, there are articles or studies \"proving\" the other incorrect or inadequate.\u00a0\u00a0From where I sit and from my own experience (with my son, diagnosed with Type I diabetes at age 10, a nephew with type I, 2 sisters and a brother with type II and myself with insulin resistance/pre-diabetes - and all but my son with weight issues), it's best to eliminate the sugar and starchy foods and eat everything else in moderation.\u00a0\u00a0I have gotten my own blood sugar levels back under control using a \"moderate\" protocol.\u00a0\u00a0I don't shun fats (except trans fats), but neither do I eat a high fat diet - that would cause my doctor to have a heart attack, since my triglycerides are higher than normal, as it is -- probably means I'm still eating too much of all kinds of fat and my liver can't process it.At any rate, while insulin resistance (as well as PCOS) can be turned around or significantly improved via the diet route and we'll all feel better eating a healthier diet, making sure we get adequate vitamins/minerals, etc, that doesn't change the fact that there is no cure for Hashimoto's and once damage has been done to thyroid tissue no diet, supplements or other means will return it to normal function and I always feel that it's misleading to imply otherwise.",

            "answer": "I was very happy to see Time Magazine's June 2014 front cover \"Eat Butter. Scientists Labeled Fat the Enemy. Why They Were Wrong.\" They sure were wrong alright. Your doctor sounds fat phobic. Aren't most doctors? :)A good article from Diet Doctor: \u201cYou Have Literally Saved My Life\u201d about the lab results that improved switching to LCHF...\"My overall stats to date include a notable reduction in Total Cholesterol down from 267 mg/dl (6.9 mmol/l) down to 162 mg/dl (4.2 mmol/l) - and an improvement in triglycerides from 478 mg/dl (5.4 mmol/l) down to 97 mg/dl (1.1 mmol/l)My weight is down from 200 lbs (91 kg) to 166 lbs (75 kg).My blood pressure down from 160/120 (for the last 5 years!) to 120/80 (consistently for the last 6 months).My doctor was sceptical at the start \u2013 and having seen the results first hand \u2013 has asked me to send them the link.\u00a0\u00a0My heart attack \u2018risk\u2019 has dropped from 15% to under 3% \u2013 and I will be continuing to find ways to refine my health by adding some additional exercise.\"And this is a good article too :One Year on an LCHF Diet with Type 1 Diabetes...\"Today I celebrate 1 year with LCHF, or I could say that I celebrate 1 year in good health! I can certainly endorse the LCHF diet as being good for type 1 diabetics.Besides a more stable blood sugar and a more easily managed diabetes, I\u2019ve gotten rid of pain in my legs, headaches, GI problems, and constant throat infections. Previously, I had recurring yeast infections, but during this past year I haven\u2019t had a single one!I only need one injection daily, instead of the previous 5-9. I eat delicious food, and I don\u2019t miss anything. I have more energy and I\u2019m happier than ever before! During the past year I\u2019ve also gotten to know, and come in contact with, a lot of great people through Instagram and my blog!I could go on about more positive things, but now I\u2019m off to make dinner. A fatty, smoked rainbow trout to honor the day!\"It is just one way to improve health so I highly question all the experts since the proof is rather in the pudding.\"",
