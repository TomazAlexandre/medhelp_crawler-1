            "answer": "i test 1 hr after eating and then at 2 hr. 1 hr is when i spike and at 2hr im lower. i also test in the morning before i eat and it is between 100-and 109, but the other day i did get one in the 130. i only have been testing my sugars for one month so i dont know if they were high then, but they could be since that is why i went in cause the fealings i get. so would i have a high ha1c if i go over 140 when i eat and had a few high ones ?(181,201,197)\u00a0\u00a0And i did read that 140 is high but my Dr. thinks its not high tell 190. :( i wonder if i need to go to a Dr. that knows stuff about this.",

            "answer": "There is no way to answer that question unless your doctor gives you an accurate diagnosis. This could be hypoglycemia, reactive hypoglycemia or diabetes. I am still concerned about those high numbers you report that are not normal in a non-diabetic. Frequently diabetes presents initially as hypoglycemia, but you are already showing hyperglycemia as well (high blood sugars). If you are having lows regularly those would make your H1C which is an average appear lower.\u00a0\u00a0Probably the dietician will encourage you to manage hypoglycemia with eating frequent small meals rather than less frequent large ones. If, however, she encourages you to eat a high carb diet, look out. If you are on the verge of developing diabetes (and my guess is you are)\u00a0\u00a0that would only make it worse.I'm not sure when you were talking about fasting and getting your blood sugar measured over intervals at the doctor's office if you were given an OGTT. That is a test that measures your reaction over a couple hours to a sugary drink. If that is what they did and your numbers went lower rather than higher that is showing you have reactive hypoglycemia which means when you eat a lot of carbs your body pumps out insulin excessively and you go low. The solution to this, if that is what you have is to limit carb intake, the same as for diabetes or pre-diabetes.My advice? Ask exactly what you are being diagnosed with. Work on lowering carbs, exercise and losing weight if you are overweight. Then continue to test and follow up with an endocrinologist in a month or two not a pcp if you continue seeing periodic highs as well as lows. Remember A1Cs are an average of 2-3 months.",

            "answer": "all she told me was that my diet is my problem. first thing she does not know what diet i\u00a0\u00a0have. so\u00a0\u00a0they put me on a diet of all wheat or whole grains no white, lots of protein with every meal\u00a0\u00a0and to eat 6 times a day and eat fat. She said nothing with my high number. that's why i think my a1c was not so low as to high because i would get lows and high. I feel low all the time so i have to eat all day to keep them up. she said my number for high are not high and not to worry about them. And i think i have reactive hypoglycemia because it gets worse after i eat some thing if i\u00a0\u00a0go with out eating it really dosent drop fast but after i eat 1 -2 hr later i can feel it and then have to keep eating or i start feeling hypo.\u00a0\u00a0aww its just makes me made, I was wondering to when i feel hypo my meter always say in the 90. but lab shows that im in the 70 - should i just fallow what my body is telling me and not my meter? or should i know that i am hypo when it says in the 90 and feeling hypo? I also read that being anemia messes with the meters. i wonder if this is true. this is why my nurse said\u00a0\u00a0the blood from my arm at the lab is right not the meter one.",

            "answer": "Not sure what to tell you besides following the instructions for diet and see if it makes a difference. It's important to be able to trust what the meter says. If your meter uses control solution (read the instructions) get some and test to make sure it is right. If it includes a code number, be sure you insert the right code tab for your strips (not all meters use these things). If you continue to feel your meter is not accurate you might want to get a different one. Yes, hypos are only below 70 or even below 60. If you have been high though and come down fast it can feel like a hypo. I would get confident with your meter as I described above and then test as often as you can afford (test strips are expensive!) two hours after meals. Perhaps the changes the dietician suggested will help. If not and you keep seeing highs as well as lows, then it is time to see a different doctor or an endocrinologist who is more skilled with blood sugar issues than regular doctor. (and who knows that anything above 140 is a problem, not above 190!)",
