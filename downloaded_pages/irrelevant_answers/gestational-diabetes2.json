            "answer": "Neeli,\u00a0\u00a0did they give you a specific diet with a calorie goal,\u00a0\u00a0and choices for each meal/snack?I think those are pretty specific to each person,\u00a0\u00a0based on your weight and calorie intake needs.I do know the basic goal is to spread carbohydrate intake throughout the day,\u00a0\u00a0and fruit intake,\u00a0\u00a0so that your blood sugar level doesn't ever \"spike\".I was eating a peanut butter sandwich on whole grain bread and a banana and a glass of milk for breakfast,\u00a0\u00a0for example,\u00a0\u00a0and a chicken breast and rice and greenbeans for lunch,\u00a0\u00a0and crackers and an orange for an afternoon snack, and a balanced dinner with healthy foods.\u00a0\u00a0And a glass of milk at bedtime.And I was walking 2 miles every other evening at a brisk pace for exercise.I was underweight when I first got pregnant,\u00a0\u00a0and so the diet wasn't based on restricting calories,\u00a0\u00a0but restricting rushes of sugar.Do you have someone in your doc's office who can help you with diet?\u00a0\u00a0It seems like that's so key to success,\u00a0\u00a0getting the diet right and understanding it.Best wishes for a very healthy pregnancy!",

            "answer": "GO have counseling with a dietician if you are having problems.\u00a0\u00a0They will give you brochures on some healthy meals that will nor raise your blood sugars.I ate a lot of chicken breasts, broccoli soup, eggs and sausage or bacon.\u00a0\u00a0I also would eat yougurt with fruit and grape nuts (along the guidelines) for breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0I also had a book from Shopko (like a Wal-mart) that had every major food chain listed and most of their foosd on how many carbs and sugars where in the dishes. Helped if I was going out to eat.\u00a0\u00a0If I knew I was going out I would limit my carbs through the day so I could have a little extra at night.\u00a0\u00a0You can do that once in a while. I knew if I had to much carbs I would start feeling funny Like dizzy.I only gained 17lbs with both my pg's.\u00a0\u00a0I had two healthy boys over 8 1/2lbs watching what I ate.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps you-- have a great rest of the pg.",

I tried controlling mine with diet and exercise, but that didn't work, i was loosing weight but\u00a0\u00a0my sugar was still to high. So he started me on insulin in my 4th month. I keep it pretty much under control. I hope my baby isn't to big either, i worry about that.They also gave me a chart to go buy and how to measure your food intake each meal and what to eat. My biggest problem i have is not eating enough breakfast before lunch and my sugar dropping to the 40's. and i have to eat some sugar to bring it up. I eat eggs, a piece of bacon, and usually a diet soda, i don't like milk in the mornings. Lunch i eat usually a sandwich on wheat, a banana, and some green beans. then maybe a banana for break. Dinner have a good meal of some sort. sometimes i'll eat a bedtime snack but not usually...Doctor seems to think i'm doing just fine. And it really keeps the weight off. I lost 8lbs in the beginning and have only gained those 8lbs back. Well good luck to u, u can do it!",

I've found so far that ANY kind of breads, milk, crackers, and of course sugar raises it tremendously... weird thing is though that I ate a half an apple the other day for snack-which is supposed to raise it and an hour later, I was too low (at 76) and feeling light-headed and shaky... it's frustrating the daylights outta me!!!!",

This afternoon, I had a cup of chef's (without my usual ritz crackers in it) salad for \"Lunch\" (which was actually my first meal of the day cause I didn't get up till 11 or so... The toughest reading for me is always the first one after the first meal I eat... but I'm proud to announce that 1 hour after my salad, I'm at a record-low-after a meal... 101!!! YAY!!! (Actually, I think that's a little low for having eaten an hour ago, but not so low that I'm worried).... YAY!!!",
