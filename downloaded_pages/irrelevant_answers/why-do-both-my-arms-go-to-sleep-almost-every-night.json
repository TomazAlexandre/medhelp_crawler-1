            "answer": "Depending on the size of your school, you should have access to some kind of health clinic where you might be able to get some answers.\u00a0\u00a0I certainly hope so, anyway.\u00a0\u00a0I'm no doctor, but it sounds like something you should have checked out as soon as possible.I would suggest, of course, working harder at keeping those sugar numbers where they ought to be.\u00a0\u00a0I've officiated at too many funerals of people whose lower extremities didn't make it to the casket with them as a result of poor diabetes management.\u00a0\u00a0You don't want that, trust me, and if you don't care for it all the time, it can get out of hand way too easily.",

            "answer": "Another option to consider is a county health center; there must be some place around you where people without insurance can have access to care.\u00a0\u00a0If all else fails, many hospitals have programs where they will treat people in need at a reduced rate, or even forgive all charges.\u00a0\u00a0You can call local hospitals and clinics and ask if they have such programs, or call the county or state and check for low or no cost health clinics.I don't have a diagnosis, don't have diabetes, and often wake up with one or both arms asleep.\u00a0\u00a0I always figure it's just because I slept on them wrong.Pastor Dan is right; with diabetes, you need to get checked out.Take good care of yourself,Kathy",

            "answer": "Thank you both. Unfortunately, I do have access to health care through my school but they have a 500.00 limit which I always exceed due to the cost of my medicines so it leaves no room for doctors visits. I was going to a free clinic but they stopped allowing me to come because if your in school you cannot be seen there. I am in school so I had to choose. And the health department where I live it has a 6-8 mth. wait because so many people dont have health insurance. I try to control my diabetes with testing and a sliding scale but the strips are so expensive I find myself picking and choosing which one between food and medical supplies. I truely dont know what else I can do. thank you guys so much for your help. God Bless you both.",

    "question": "Hi. I am a 23 year old college student who has had type 1 diabetes since I was 8. I have not had any major problems. Although I do not keep great control of my diabetes I try to do the best I can with what I have (no health insurance). My question is...Almost every night when I go to sleep I am waken up by both my arms being asleep. Why is that? What can be the cause of that? I did some research and all that came up was that it could be CT(carpel tunnel syndrome) or MS. I try to awaken my arms by standing up with them over my head but it almost never works. I am awake now with my left arms numb and my right arms going numb. My fingers and legs do the same thing. Pleasae help me.",
