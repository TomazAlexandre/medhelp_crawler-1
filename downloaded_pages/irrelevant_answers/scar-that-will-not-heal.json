    "question": "I was hoping someone could offer some suggestions. I had a surgical breast biopsy last year because of suspicious tissue. Fortunately, all is well for now. But the incision on my breast is not healing well and is red and painful. It's been a whole year and I thought the pain would be gone by now and that the redness on the incision would have faded. Thanks for any suggestions you could give.",
