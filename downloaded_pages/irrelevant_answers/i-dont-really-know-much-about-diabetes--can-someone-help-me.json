            "answer": "Yeah it would take a simple blood test to see if you have Diabetes. Neuropathy Pain usually comes when you have had Diabetes for some time.Years even. I think you would have shown other signs If the pain is related to Diabetes. You can be tested for Diabetes but I'm guessing the pain is due to something else. you need to find an insurance Company or see if you are eligible for State Health care. then find a doctor who will accept your insurance. If the pain is really bugging you badly then go to an ER...they could diagnose your problem right there, Get your insurance rollin, and refer you to a doctor if you ask. That would be the best thing to do. They can give you the necessary paper work to apply for insurance and can refer you to a doctor who specializes in you prognosis....Hope I have helped, good Luck! :)",
