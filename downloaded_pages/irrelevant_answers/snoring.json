If it is sleep apnea then it is a serious condition, he needs to consult a doctor immediately.He can try sleeping without a pillow, avoiding alcohol and smoking esp around bedtime and lose weight and see if it helps.",

            "answer": "You should have him see a sleep specialist to see if he has obstructive sleep apnea. All the traditional conservative options may sometimes work, but is usually temporary, and only delays getting diagnosed properly. With that degree of snoring, he has a high likelihood of having obstructive sleep apnea. Treating his sleep apnea will not only treat his snoring, but also may save his life. Untreated sleep apnea can aggravate or cause hypertension, diabetes, weight gain, depression, heart disease, heart attack or stroke.",
