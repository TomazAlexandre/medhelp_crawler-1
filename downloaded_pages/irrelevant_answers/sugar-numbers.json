            "answer": "a1c is the average, but it is also important to see the fasting numbers.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes early in diabetes only the fasting numbers may be high, and paying attention to these may give a heads up on taking action.Ideally fasting is < 100 (and even better if it's in the 80s).\u00a0\u00a0Normal non-diabetic a1c is < 5.0, though you may not get diagnosed as diabetic until you are 5.7 or higher.The a1c is an average, so what looks like a good average could actually be a mix of very high and very low numbers, and thus not really so good.The range of results seen is also important.",
