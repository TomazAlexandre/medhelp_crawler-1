            "answer": "I would chart when you feel this way, how many times a day, does anything upsetting precede it, how long does it last, that type of thing, and then go back to the doctor with that information. It is possible it is anxiety, but it is also important that neurological/biological things be ruled out. If you are lightheaded and very dizzy ALL of the time it could be something like an inner ear problem. It may also be that you need more medication to treat the original problem. The first round may not have been strong enough.Be a squeaky wheel. Make sure you keep going back until you get some answers.",
