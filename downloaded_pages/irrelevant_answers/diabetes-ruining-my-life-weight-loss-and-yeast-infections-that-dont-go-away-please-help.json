            "answer": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I'm glad you realized the error of your ways.\u00a0\u00a0The cause of your weight loss is absolutely your high blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0As the body doesn't get the insulin it needs, it begins to consume itself.The most important thing to do, as you know, is to get your blood sugars back under control.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like you know how to manage your blood sugars once you get them back in range.\u00a0\u00a0Have you checked for ketones?\u00a0\u00a0Those are the byproducts from the process that caused you to lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0If you have ketones, you must immediately act to get rid of those, and I suspect you do from your comment that you can't gain weight.\u00a0\u00a0Your diet isn't as big of deal as you may think, because as long as you understand your carb ratios, you can eat pretty much anything, you just need to make sure you take the proper amount of insulin to cover it.\u00a0\u00a0Now, that's not license to eat as much of anything as you want, it is just an understanding that, as a diabetic, you aren't limited to only low carb or no carb foods.\u00a0\u00a0The yeast infection is likely a by-product of your high blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0I'd suspect it would clear up, with the help of antibiotics, once your blood sugars are back in control.So the first thing to do check for ketones.\u00a0\u00a0You can get ketosticks at your local pharmacy to do that testing.\u00a0\u00a0The second thing I would do is make an appointment with an endocrinologist, if you haven't already.\u00a0\u00a0They can talk you through how to handle the ketones, because the amount of extra insulin you'll need depends on a lot of factors.\u00a0\u00a0They can also help you re-determine your carb ratios, get you back on the proper amounts of long acting insulin, and likely even get you in contact with a dietician to help you with what you eat.\u00a0\u00a0They'll help you make a plan for getting things back in order.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!\u00a0\u00a0I know you'll do great!",

            "answer": "You might also want to have your thyroid checked. I had Graves disease and ate and ate but actually lost weight. Graves disease is an overactive thyroid. Sometimes when you have diabetes you can develop other endocrine system diseases. I am not trying to scare you or make people think once you have diabetes you will develop another disease, but there is the possibility. The most common thyroid test is the blood test that measures the amount of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in your bloodstream. The test is sometimes called the thyrotropin-stimulating hormone test.",

    "question": "Hello everyone. I am ashamed of writing this, for i know ive been horrible with ym diabetes. I have been a type 1 diabetic since i was 11, i am now 23. Always had it under ocntrol, eating right, etc.Abount a year and a half ago, i decided to stop taking insulin because i\u00a0\u00a0read a stupid book \"natural cures they dont want u to know abouit\" which\u00a0\u00a0said to stop all insulin and get cured. Since then, i have lost a lot of weight, too much weight for me. I went fro a size 9 to a 3. I have had an ongoing yeast infetion for a year now. I very recently started taking my insulin again, and i eat a lot, but dont gain weight. I took blood tests and everything came out good, except for my Blood sugar of course, its too high. Could this be the cause of my weight loss? And my yeast infections? If so, how can i get back on tract? has anyone been trhough this? I know i need to cut down on the sugar, i eat way too much fatteing food, but never gain weight. I realy wanna get my life back together. Thanks for any advice. God bless you all!",
