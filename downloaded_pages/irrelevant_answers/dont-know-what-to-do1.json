I had my first ultrasound transvaginally at 9 weeks and that's the earliest the ultrasound tech said they would do it because it freaks moms out not to see anything.I would just go to your appt tomorrow and wait it out. It will be worth it.",

            "answer": "You can't always get a heartbeat at 6 weeks. And it also depends how good the ultrasound sound machine is. My 9 weeks first appt and ultrasound you could make out eyes mouth baby sac and clearly see heartbeat. But 6 weeks is very ify usually. I would just go to the appointment. Get the ultrasound next appt. You may be able to hear heartbeat on Doppler i was able to at 8 weeks. And you don't need a prescription for prenatals hun. Most of the ones they are prescribe are rather harsh and hard to digest anyways. Really just depends what they give you.",
