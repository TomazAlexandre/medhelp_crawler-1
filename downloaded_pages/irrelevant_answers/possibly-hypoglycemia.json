            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!This could be due to hypoglycemia. Many who suffer from hypoglycemia have polycystic disease of the ovary associated with insulin resistance. Increased insulin levels can cause hypoglycemia. Excessive alcohol intake, hepatitis, kidney disease, certain medications, disorders of adrenal gland etc can all cause hypoglycemia. It can also be caused by poor eating patterns. Rarely is it caused by insulin secreting tumors called insulinomas. These can secrete huge amounts of insulin after food and a person can suffer from hypoglycemia despite eating.You need to consult an endocrine specialist. You will need to run a few more tests which will monitor your blood glucose level, insulin level and C-peptide level. A CT scan or MRI of abdomen may be done to rule out polycystic disease of the ovary. Sometimes suppression tests are done in a hospital setting to see the effect of insulin. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Another idea to explore- how are your pulse and blood pressure after you eat, particularly when you've been standing a couple of minutes?\u00a0\u00a0Having an orthostatic intolerance condition, I have experienced getting hot and sweating simply from tachycardia (rapid heartbeat) when standing.\u00a0\u00a0And on a tilt table test, after a nitro tab and before I passed out, I felt rather sick, maybe kind of nauseous.I also can have an increase in headache when standing after I've eaten a meal.\u00a0\u00a0Your heart has to work harder when your body is digesting a meal.",
