            "answer": "here's the gist of the interview, it was on Marketplace, NPR..The diabetes drug Avandia has been linked by a study to heart attacks and deaths. Commentator Dr. Stefan\u00a0\u00a0says, in addition to the drug itself, the system that led to it being so heavily prescribed should be examined.TEXT OF COMMENTARY: A full-page ad in the Wall\u00a0\u00a0on your average Tuesday runs more than $250,000. Multiply that by three or four national papers, and another handful of regional editions, and it's a big pile of money. But doubtless considered well-spent by the drugmaker GlaxThe company took out the ads today to reassure patients about the safety of its diabetes drug, Avandia. A couple of weeks ago, the New England Journal of Medicine reported Avandia's been linked to heart attacks and deaths. As a result, two things have happened. Glaxo's stock price has taken a hit. Also, commentator Doctor Stefan\u00a0\u00a0has seen a change in his rounds at the hospital.DOCTOR STEFAN : During visits to patient's rooms, we hear the TV blaring: \"If you think you've been harmed by Avandia, call our attorneys.\" The other day, one of us was called away from the bedside of a man with chest pains to handle a call from a patient worried about Avandia.But all that pales in comparison to the possibility that some patients may have been hurt or killed by medicines offered with every intention of helping them.But let me ask this: why were we prescribing so much Avandia in the first place?In recent years, we've been putting patients on two or even three different medications just to meet the elusively low blood sugar standards that diabetic experts promote. Avandia was typically the second or third drug in that cocktail.The real problem is a rise in absolutist quality standards for the treatment of each chronic medical condition. That includes the notion that we should drive diabetic blood sugar, cholesterol, even blood pressure as low as it can go.Those standards, soon to be given sharp teeth by Medicare in a program called Pay for Performance, reflect advice from experts whose perceptions are skewed.The research guiding our experts is based on single diseases. So the experts rarely take into account just how complicated and dangerous it can be to treat a patient with four diseases and 12 different medications that can mix in unforeseen ways.And the experts who devise quality standards often benefit financially from the drug companies who naturally want us to prescribe more drugs in service of ever-more demanding targets for blood sugar, cholesterol or anything else.Medicine is supposed to help people, not harm them.So first, we need to demand that health care standards organizations, like the National Committee for Quality Assurance, publicly and fully disclose the financial interests of their experts. And next, our government must slow down before rushing head-long into a torrid affair with quality standards that may yet betray us all.",

A drug company could release a drug that cured everything and caused people to poop gold and you would find something to complain about. I'm not saying the Pharm companies are perfect but one of them is likely saving my life. I can be thankful or I can scour the web top to bottom looking for things to complain about.Concerning your comment about the \"green leaf,\" to claim people don't die over it is ludicrous. Also, my neighbors have some stuff I'd like to have, I can't believe they'd put me in jail if I went and took it, it's likely nobody would die.",

            "answer": "though there talking about cancer...thought this article was in interesting as well as far as tailoring treatments...- Doctors are closer to predicting which cancer patients can skip chemotherapy and avoid the brutal side effects of that staple of cancer care, doctors at a major medical meeting said on Tuesday.The move toward helping patients avoid chemotherapy -- and perhaps the nausea, hair loss and weakened immune system that are its hallmarks -- is a positive side effect of the individualization of cancer treatment, doctors at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting said.\"Chemotherapy is clearly effective for patients -- on average. But can it be spared?\" Dr. Aron , of the Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, said at a panel at the meeting, which wrapped up here.Women patients with high levels of estrogen receptors -- cancer cells containing special proteins that bind to the hormone estrogen -- are among the patient subsets that may not benefit from chemotherapy for breast cancer, experts said.More research is needed to determine the best regimes and to define the particular subgroups, said Dr. Kathy\u00a0\u00a0, director of the breast clinical research program at\u00a0\u00a0University Medical Center in Illinois.But it is coming, probably in a few years, she said.\"We have entered the tailored therapy era,\" Albain said.Breast cancer is in the forefront in this area, but experts said others are following, including lung cancer which is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world.\"Now, predictive factors for lung cancer are coming down the pike, rather than just blindly assigning patients to treatments A, B or C,\" said Dr. Gregory , who specializes in lung cancer at Ohio State University Medical Center.So-called targeted cancer treatments -- drugs that attack or bind to a specific molecule or part of a molecule such as one that triggers tumor growth or controls blood flow -- have been around for several years.What emerged as a theme at this year's meeting is these drugs' effectiveness in more types of the disease, experts said.\"Ten years ago it was all about chemo,\" said Dr. Kim , director of the Duke University Comprehensive Cancer Center. \"This time you walk down the convention center and it's all about new targets. And we can get more mileage out these drugs if we can predict who will respond.\"",
