            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The nodules are probably multiple neurofibromas. These are harmless swellings made up of nerves and fibrous tissues. In some cases they run in families. Generally they do not require treatment. A similar condition causing nodules under the skin is Schwannomas. This is also genetically linked.Other than this they can be swollen lymph nodes or even cysts or lipomas. Sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, pseudorheumatoid disease, foreign body granulomas, leprosies, leishmaniasis (parasitic disease caused by bite of sand fly), lupus, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and deep fungal infections should also be looked into. A ganglion can also undergo granulomatous change.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Do discuss this with your doctor (skin specialist) and get yourself examined. Take care!",
