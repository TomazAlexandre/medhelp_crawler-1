            "answer": "No, there as not really such a thing as withdrawal. However, you don't say how high your blood sugars were either time. If you were high enough the first time to end up in the ER that means you had a lot of stress on your body which can manifest emotionally as well. It takes awhile to recover completely. Very high blood sugars can cause various feelings and symptoms including anxiety (as can lows). Also, as a newly diagnosed person with diabetes it is understandable that you may be having a very anxious reaction to the news. Adjusting to diabetes and learning everything you know can be overwhelming. As some time passes and things get back to normal for you, if you continue with a high level of anxiety you might want to talk to someone.",

            "answer": "I had a painic attack once and this sounds like it... panic attacks can increase blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0There is an article on panic attacks on helium.com.\u00a0\u00a0Panic attacks can be triggered from something physical or mental... either way, the result is the same.If this happens again... take sugar test immediately.. If it's under 200... try eating something that will add tryptophan (spelling)\u00a0\u00a0like a turkey sandwich or milk.\u00a0\u00a0If the attack seems severe and sugars are high... professional help may be needed.\u00a0\u00a0This is my opinion only... please talk to your regular doctor about it (not the one in ER since they don't have your history, etc.)",

    "question": "If there such as think as high blood sugar withdrawls?\u00a0\u00a0Or am i just having panic attacks?\u00a0\u00a0I very recently was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and ended up in the emergency room twice.\u00a0\u00a0The first time I was diagnosed and the second time I had similar symptoms that led me there the first time:\u00a0\u00a0Arms and hands (especially left) a little tingley and numb and a swollen feeling on and off.\u00a0\u00a0Pacing around like just \"keyed up\" very nerveous feelings, then after laying down a bit and getting back up my legs felt heavy.\u00a0\u00a0Just a very high sense of anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0I have never had a panic attack so was this just one?\u00a0\u00a0Before suspecting diabetes and then being diagnosed i never had this happen.\u00a0\u00a0I went to ER a second time and told them these same systems (after 2 days before being placed on medication) and they gave me an anxiety medication.\u00a0\u00a0Just wondered since I don't know how long my sugar was high is there such a thing as \"withdrawls\" that may be causing these symtoms?\u00a0\u00a0Or just pure anxiety?",
