            "answer": "Hi, I am sorry you are having to go through such a rough time. I wanted to let you know that I too have suffered with all of these symptoms. After 2 years of seeing many doctors I found an Endocrinologist that diagnosed me with inflammation of the thyroid with normal blood levels, reactive hypoglycemia and insulin resistance. You said you had your thyroid checked but, what tests did the doctor actually do? Did he or she check your thyroid antibodies, free t- 4, free t-3 and TSH?\u00a0\u00a0Did they check your pituitary hormones?My doctor never explained the cause of my low blood pressure because they think it is a great blood pressure even though it wasn't my normal. My blood pressure typically runs 120/70 and it was running 94/58. My doctor started me on a low dose of Armour thyroid med. It helped take down the inflammation and with my symptoms. It wasn't until I started taking Metformin, strict low glycemic high fiber diet, and moderate exercise that most of my issues disappeared. You may want to be checked for low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) also. This can happen when you have insulin resistance or thyroid issues. I would definitely set an appointment with an Endocrinologist so he or she can check these things out as well as check all of your hormones to see if there is any imbalance. Good Luck",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You have described your symptoms pretty well. From you symptoms alone it sounds like chronic fatigue syndrome. This usually presents with widespread myalgia and arthralgia, headaches, chronic mental and physical exhaustion, cognitive difficulties, concentration difficulty and memory problems.Then you also need to investigate other causes of brain fog like liver dysfunction (get liver enzymes done\u2014liver function test), kidney dysfunction (get kidney function test done), and anemia. Thyroid problems, adrenal gland function and diabetes should be checked.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome that turned into fibromyalgia after my gall bladder surgery. My fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue has been cured after the insulin resistance was addressed with medication (helps your insulin receptors become more sensitive to insulin), low glycemic high fiber diet and exercise. Please go to an Endocrinologist, give them a list of your symptoms and tell them what you would like checked into. You should be evaluated by an Endo first. Then go from there.",
