            "answer": "It sounds like it could be eczema. I had a similar reaction to the water softener my landlords were using and had to buy a filter for my shower. The itchiness went away very quickly after I changed that.Do you use any lotion? Perhaps you are allergic to the lotion you are using and breaking out from it. There are several things that can cause a reaction like that. Just try making some changes and see what works. Trial and error. If nothing seems to work you can always go consult a physician.",

            "answer": "Hello,Itching all over the body can be found in allergies, viral infection, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods .You can take some OTC oral antihistamine medications like Benadryl or Claritin and see if it helps.For mild-moderate symptoms a weak steroid may be used, whilst more severe cases require a higher-potency steroid. But they are available under prescription and should be taken only after consulting a dermatologist. Also wear cotton clothes.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
