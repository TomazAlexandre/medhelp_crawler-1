During my first midwife app she went through my and my husbands medical history, so it pays to ask both sides of family if there is any histories of heart disease,\u00a0\u00a0high or low blood pressure,\u00a0\u00a0diabetes and disability such as down syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0She took blood pressure,\u00a0\u00a0height and weight and listened to babies heart beat.\u00a0\u00a0No internal check up. You will also get bag full of information on breast feeding, birth plans and other pregnancy related booklets. They also made me fill out form which basically asks about hoe ypu feel about pregnancy so far and than they add up ypur scores to determine if you at risk of depression and things like that.\u00a0\u00a0Im assuming it would be the same in every state. They will also set up app for 20 week scan which can determine any abnormalities in baby and you would be able to find gender.",
