            "answer": "Hello,The lump that you are describing sounds like a boil. Boils are caused by infection of the hair follicle by staph aureus. A boil generally starts as a reddened, tender area. Over time, the area becomes firm and hard. Eventually, the center of the abscess softens and becomes filled with pus.Ingrown hair are the commonest causes of boils.Apply hot compresses on the boil.As long as the boil is hard,it is difficult draining it.But once it becomes soft,drainage is easy.You need to consult a doctor for its drainage or for prescription of antibiotics.In future also,when shaving the bikini line, get some facial scrub and vigorously scrub bikini line area twice a week. If you notice any ingrowns hairs, you can attempt to squeeze and pluck them out and they will then heal spontaneoulsly.Also wear loose-fitting underwear and clothing.Hope it helps.Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "Hi,This could be folliculitis, dermatitis, or allergic reaction. In most individuals there are outbreaks of folliculitis from time to time.Folliculitis is infection and inflammation of the hair follicles. The condition may be superficial (i.e., on the surface of the skin) or deep within the follicles.The most common cause of folliculitis is infection by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus.Folliculitis symptoms can appear independent of infection. Exposure of the skin to certain chemicals, especially oils and tars, can trigger an outbreak. People with depressed immune systems, diabetes, or obesity have a greater risk of contracting folliculitis than the general population.Be extremely careful about personal hygiene. Application of antiseptic washes may help prevent recurrences. A topical antibiotic cream, mupirocin (Bactroban\u00ae), has been effective at reducing bacterial colonization in the nostrils. It is applied twice daily for a week and is repeated every 6 months.Let us know if you need any other information and consult a skin specialist if the lesion is persistent.Regards.",

    "question": "I recently shaved my bikinni area. A bump appeared under my skin. It is irritated by my underware and uncomfortable. I tried to pop it with a sterilized pin. Some clear fluid came out when I squeezed-but the lump seems to have gotten larger. It is painful and uncomfortable...It has now been about 5 days and the sist-like lump is still there. Does this sound like an ingrown hair problem or a STD? I have never been diagnosed with a STD and have been to an OBGYN within the past 3 months (for a regular anual exam & blood work) and have not been sexually active in nearly a year.Please help with advice!!!Thank you!",
