    "question": "\"MARIJUANA;GATEWAY TO HEALTH\"by Clint Werner.Briefly, I am a 'seasoned' RN Hospice Case Manager, and as such I am not offering medical advice, simply recounting my experiences. Over the years of my practice I have witnessed the benefits of cannabis for many of my patients. I suffer from what I call DDDM-Decades of Denial and deferred Maintenance,(Diabetes, HTN, A-fib, chronic pain, spinal degeneration, arthritis etc) which is tarnishing my 'golden years; have had major spinal and other surgeries; diagnosed with Chondrocalcinosis, a rare disorder for which there is no treatment, an accumulation of calcium crystals in the joints, excrutiatingyl painful. After 20 years of not using cannabis as a result of severe negative psych reactions I started researching out of desparation. About 4 months ago I started using cannabis in various formulations, starting low and going slow. I have gradually weaned myself from Oxycontin; Methadone; Liquid Morphine PRN. Gabapentin; Colcrys; Dilaudid and various other 'pain meds'.I now have significantly improved pain control and my 'mood' is vastly improved, much to my wife's delight. I'm not attributing all this improvement to cannabis alone but now I won't leave home without it. Our dependence on 'pharmaceuticals' is alarming, we are addicted to the 'legal' drugs pushed by BigPharma. They do their place, I'm glad Morphine and Versed were available during my surgeries, I don't think cannabis preparations would have provided much relief when they were slicing and dicing me. While I don't necessarily believe that cannabis is the silver bullet that some claim, I am convinced by empirical and personal evidence that it has enormous potential. The fairly recent 'discovery' of the Endocannabinoid system lends additional creedence to this view. I don't have a dog in this fight but I highly recommend the above book as an excellent primer for anyone truly interested in this topic and the health of themselves and their loved ones. Please approach it with an open mind and a receptive heart.Thankyou.Patrick Monk.RN.SF. Ca.Society of Cannabis Clinicians.",
