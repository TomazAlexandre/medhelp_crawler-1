Because of the inflammation, the liver doesn\u2019t work as well as it should.NASH can get worse and cause scarring of the liver, which leads to cirrhosis. But the disease doesn't always get worse.NASH is similar to the kind of liver disease that is caused by long-term, heavy drinking. But NASH occurs in people who don't abuse alcohol.What causes NASH?Experts don't know why some people with a buildup of fat in the liver get NASH and some don't. It could be that something in the environment triggers the inflammation in those people. Or maybe it runs in their families.Risk factors for NASH and liver damage include:Obesity.Diabetes.High cholesterol and high triglycerides.Metabolic syndrome.Most people with NASH are 40 to 50 years old and have one or more of the problems listed above.
