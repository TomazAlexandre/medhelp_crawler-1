    "question": "Hi - this is extremely extremely frustrating.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, for days/weeks in a row, I have partial ED - I can't get an erection even when masturbating, and I don't really have nighttime erections either.\u00a0\u00a0Then, for a couple weeks, everything is fine - including erections when masturbating and nightime erections.\u00a0\u00a0Then, back to problems.\u00a0\u00a0I've been to the doctor and had a physical, everything came back normal or great, with the one exception that my HDL was low.\u00a0\u00a0My testosterone was approx. 460, which I understand isn't great but isn't in the problem area.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't specically ask about diabetes but I assume that would have come out during either the bloodwork or the urine sample.\u00a0\u00a0I do suffer from anxiety and depression, but at this has been going on for a couple years, I think the ED is at the root of alot of the depression so I hesitate to say that the depression caused the ED.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes Viagra/Cialis/Levitra work GREAT, other times, I get an erection but still not great.Questions:\u00a0\u00a01)\u00a0\u00a0what do I do?\u00a0\u00a0I'd say it was just \"all in my head\" - especially since it worked great for almost a month in a row when I was on vacation overseas a few months ago - but I can't say I \"feel\" different mentall when it is working or not working.\u00a0\u00a0Could there be a diet element to it?2)\u00a0\u00a0Can taking an SSRI to control anxiety (and yes I know that they sometimes cause or contribute to a problem) help me here?\u00a0\u00a0If the anxiety is conquered and I don't get the sexual side effects, could this be a solution?Thanks for your response.\u00a0\u00a0This is stopping my life from moving forward at this point.",
