            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!A lump in armpit can be a swollen lymphnode, in response to fungal infection or sweat dermatitis or infection of hair follicles. It can also be folliculitis or a hair follicle infection. It can also be an enlarged lymphnode due to malignancy of breast (rare in males but not impossible). At times it is a cyst too and this can get infected. Consult your PCP for an evaluation. A CT scan can be confirmatory or a fine needle biopsy. Treatment can vary from wait and watch to anti-inflammatory along with antibiotics to excision of the lump. Check for diabetes too as high sugar often results in repeated infection and boils.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "It sounds like your lymph nodes could be swollen, and with a high fever, it sounds like your body is trying to fight off a massive infection.\u00a0\u00a0If it was foliculitis, the bumps would be large and red, with possibly a white head on the top.\u00a0\u00a0If these are just lumps under the skin, then it is more than likely lymph nodes.\u00a0\u00a0You probably need to have a CBC done, and a doctor may need to drain the nodes and possibly biopsy them to find out what is going on or what kind of infection they are dealing with.\u00a0\u00a0Im sorry you are going through this.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you feel better soon.",
