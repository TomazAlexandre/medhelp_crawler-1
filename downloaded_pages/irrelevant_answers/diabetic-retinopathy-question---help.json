    "question": "I have had a vitrectomy in my left eye which is doing much better. Last Friday (05-11-12) my Optomologist said my other eye was \"set up\" to have similar problems.\u00a0\u00a0He scheduled the laser treatment on 06-01...3 weeks away.My question is, how long does diabetic retinopathy take to develop?\u00a0\u00a0I am in pretty decent control of my diabetes. My A1C is 6.4. I know the better control the slower it develops. I do have a floater in there that was present when he examined me last week.And I believe he said there was no\u00a0\u00a0blood vessel growth that he saw.Just wondering if I can make it to the 06-01-12 w/o any hemmorages.",
