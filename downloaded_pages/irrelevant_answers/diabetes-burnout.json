            "answer": "Hi Pete,Been there done that. However you did not say if you are Type 1 or 2?? I am type 1 and at first my A1C was 11.2...OMG\u00a0\u00a0BAD..If you are overweight and try some walking or some exercise that will get your numbers down. Also Cinnamon has been proven to lower your blood sugars. I no the feeling WATCHING everything you eat. I just try and stick to protein and vegs so I don't have to take so much Insulin then gain weight. A low carb diet for Diabetes is best, although I must say i do\u00a0\u00a0love my Pizza:) If you also go to www.diabetes.org you can learn allot on how to loose weight, what to eat, etc...A great source of information. Hang in there..It can be done and takes time..But you certainly want your numbers to come down, not good for your health. I also discovered even when I thought I was eating great and my last A1C was over 8 the ENDO said I can help you with your Insulin but YOU have to control your stress. SOOOO if you are having allot of stress that makes your blood sugars go all over the board and esp higher. Try ways to Relax and your blood sugars will get better. It will get better.. Hang in there!!",

            "answer": "Hey Pete, this is normal and it does get frustrating since you are doing everything right!\u00a0\u00a0This happened with my husband, and his doctor wanted him on insulin which my husband felt would be like \"the end.\"\u00a0\u00a0Finally, we convinced him that if the insulin better controlled his sugar then that was the way to go, because he was doing everything correctly and the oral meds just weren't doing the job for him. As a result, the constant high sugar levels were hurting his body, and he needed to take this seriously and get his level down. He has been on insulin for several years now and his sugar is very well controlled.\u00a0\u00a0It's something to think about and talk to your doctor about.\u00a0\u00a0It gets old, but it does beat the alternative.\u00a0\u00a0Keep looking for answers and make your doctors explain \"why\" this is happening when you are doing everything right. A diabetic diet is a very healthy diet which will benefit you in many other ways.\u00a0\u00a0You aren't just helping your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I eat like a diabetic to stay healthy.\u00a0\u00a0Eating healthy will keep your health problems to a minimum, so know your diet is helping you in so many other ways.\u00a0\u00a0Don't give up, get answers!\u00a0\u00a0I wish you all the best.",

            "answer": "IMHO, diet and exercise may hold diabetes back for a little while but you can't hold back the tide. Ditto for drugs. The only sure-fire cure I know of is gastric bypass surgery, even if you're only mildly overweight. Before they even leave the hospital, patients are completely cured. If you have other co-morbidities like\u00a0\u00a0hypertension or joint problems, I don't know why it isn't offered as an early option.",
