            "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear this.\u00a0\u00a0I take it your brother-in-law had good quality of life before the injury, so this must be quite a shock to everyone.\u00a0\u00a0From the time he hit his head, and his brain started to bleed while on warfarin, things were serious.\u00a0\u00a0Inside the skull, the blood has nowhere to go, so pressure builds up on the brain as the blood collects and is unable to drain out.\u00a0\u00a0That pressure has the potential to cause permanent brain damage.\u00a0\u00a0I'm thinking the neurosurgeon would not even have operated on your brother-in-law unless there was already a substantial risk of death or permanent disability.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the seriousness of the situation was not emphasized to the family, but neurosurgery is always serious.Surgery itself is always a trauma to the body, and brain surgery is a trauma to the brain.\u00a0\u00a0A major surgery is hard for even a young, healthy person to recover from.\u00a0\u00a0Prior to the event, your brother-in-law already had diabetes and atrial fibrillation (assuming I understand correctly that a-fib is the reason why he was on warfarin), both of which increase the risks involved in surgical recovery.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know where the lung infection came from, but those aren't uncommon among bedfast people, including individuals recovering from surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Being on a ventilator carries its own risk of infection, since foreign objects such as a suction device have to be introduced into the trachea and lungs.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes make wound healing (including surgical wound healing) and recovery from infection more difficult.\u00a0\u00a071 is not old for someone who is active and independent, but it's not young for someone who is undergoing major surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, your brother-in-law had some things stacked against him at the outset.I feel that I have dwelt on the negative, and I apologize for doing so in this time of crisis for your family.\u00a0\u00a0My intent is to help you understand how things have come to this point, as you seemed to be asking for that.\u00a0\u00a0My hope and wish is that your brother-in-law will rally and recover.",

            "answer": "thank you for your informative view, yes it is pretty negative, but you have given a clearer indication of what is possibly happening which we havent been told! In your experience do you think there is light at the end of this tunnel? Miracles do happen! do you know if there is anything medically which could possible be done to try and wake him up, which hasnt been done yet?",

            "answer": "Miracles do happen, yes.\u00a0\u00a0I think your brother-in-law's doctors are evaluating, day by day, the prospects for recovery.\u00a0\u00a0Depending on the amount of brain damage, there may not be anything they can \"do,\" other than provide supportive care and continue to fight the infection.\u00a0\u00a0In terms of predicting outcome, a lot depends on whether there are medical signs that the brain is still alive, such as whether your brother-in-law's pupils react to light, can he withdraw from a painful stimulus, and what kind of activity does brain imaging show.\u00a0\u00a0There's not a miracle drug that wakes people up, though.\u00a0\u00a0People wake up when the brain has recovered enough from its injuries that the brain itself wakes up.",
