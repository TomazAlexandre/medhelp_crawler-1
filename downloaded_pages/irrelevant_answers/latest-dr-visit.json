            "answer": "What thyroid tests are being run exactly?How high is the prolactin? Are the other pituitary hormones (other than TSH, I assume) being run?I am just asking as if you read up more in pituitary disorders - you will find that well, diabetes, low D, high tirglicerides, infections, and weight gain are symptoms and that it might not be all Hashimoto's and it may not be just a prolactinoma. The digestive issues can tie in as well.What other tests are you getting?",

It's still in range obviously, but last time I went off dostinex for 5 weeks as a test from the Cleveland Clinic dr. I saw, it went up to 18 and I began lactation again.Let me know if you want results of any of the tests.... I have them all with me.",

            "answer": "Is the ACTH done correctly - chilled tube, lavender, spun while you are sitting there, not put in the bin? If not spun immediately (renin is the same) the results will be lower as it degrades in minutes once it is in the tube. Spinning help - chilled tube and spinning helps more.No Free T4 or Free T3. She could also do GH which is the pit part of the IGF one - IGF-1 is the metabolite that the body uses, so it is the better test to show GHD, but GH may show what the pit is doing. IGF-1 shows how the liver metabolizes the GH and puts out the hormone that is actually used, which is IGF-1.Have they done any tests for inflammation - SED, CRP, etc?",

    "question": "Hey all,Just had my quarterly checkup with my endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0For the 4th time my thyroid medication has to be increased. :-(\u00a0\u00a0Bummer, but oh well.\u00a0\u00a0It helps me with energy and should help with weight a little at the new dose.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully it will eventually level out, but with this type of thyroid disorder (Hashimotos) it's my immune system killing off the thyroid, so I don't know.\u00a0\u00a0She also said that at my next appointment in a few months, if my prolactin is still as high as it is (or at least not as low as she wants it) she will need to increase my tumor medication (cabergoline .5 1 x weekly) because it's showing signs of not responding as well now.\u00a0\u00a0She is waiting for a few tests to come back still on other things to confirm that.\u00a0\u00a0But most everything else was pretty good or at least better than it was last time.Cholesterol LDL is low and triglycerides are a high... but not excessive.\u00a0\u00a0She just recommended more fish oils.\u00a0\u00a0She recommended I see a kidney dr. soon though, because with my diabetes, high BP, tumor, low vitamin D, and high triglycerides as well as a recent bladder/kidney infection with protein in my urine, she is worried it could all be effecting the kidneys.\u00a0\u00a0Probably just a precaution though. She said my diabetes control is excellent though. She is proud of me for that.\u00a0\u00a0I have been doing much better with taking my vitamin D now that I have the gummy vitamins, they are yummy!\u00a0\u00a0So, hopefully when she gets the results back for it I will no longer be low!Overall I actually feel pretty good other than the weight really dragging me down and for some odd reason my stomach/intestines always seem mad at me. lol.\u00a0\u00a0She checked to see if I had a problem with Gluten (Celiac) causing the constant loose poo's, but it came back sortof middle of the road, so she doesn't know if that's it, she said a GI dr. would be able to help me more with that and to show him/her the test.",
