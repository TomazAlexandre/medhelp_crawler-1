            "answer": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Long term high blood sugars can lead to complications like he tingling feeling you have, as the extra glucose in your system.\u00a0\u00a0The first thing you need to do is figure out how to lower your blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Changing your diet, increasing your exercise, adjusting your carb ratios, these are all things you can do to lower your blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Lowering them will do more to prevent complications than anything else.150 is not a low blood sugar for anyone, it's on the high side of normal.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms you are feeling when your blood sugars get down to 150 may be related to your body adjusting to more normal blood sugars and away from the higher ones.\u00a0\u00a0Depending on how you are losing weight (diet and exercise versus some kind of drug or medication), it may be related to that, but it's hard to say without knowing the how.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms you have can be related to hyperglycemia, but not usually.\u00a0\u00a0I can't find much about Junovia, to know how it might be affecting you.I would definitely call your doctor's office and let them know of your symptoms to find out if your appointment can be moved up sooner.\u00a0\u00a0It's definitely worth a shot.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

I am already on Metformin and she wantsme to take Actos as well.\u00a0\u00a0My blood sugars have only been highlately because it is hot here and I can't go walking like I usually do.I don't think it is fair that they give me more meds when it is onlythe weather affecting my exercise routine.\u00a0\u00a0And yes, walking keepsmy sugars down around 120 and 115 and 96 -- so without the walkingI am get higher readings like 135 148.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I think doctorsare too quick to give people more and more drugs.

    "question": "I am diabetic and I have been running 220 on my blood sugar on a regular basis even when I test it in the morning without any food. When my sugar drops to 150, I get really tired, weird feeling in my legs and nauseas.For someone like me who constantly has a high blood sugar is 150 considered low?Also can high blood sugar be related in any way to weight loss? I am experiencing some weight loss and I am not sure if it due to my sugar, the fact I was taken off Avandia and put on Junovia because I know Avandia increases weight or if something else is happening to me.Also would high blood sugar like mine lead to sweating, tingling in legs and hands and I almost feel like my body is hot... but I don",
