            "answer": "Hi Cruzy,Did the moderators in the HCV forum just move your post??? If so, hopefully they\u2019ll see this and move it back; there is likely an HCV association.It took me a minute to review your previous posts in here to better understand your situation. Here\u2019s a link to an old discussion for others to review if they\u2019re interested:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Hepatitis-C/Cirrosis/show/1670496#post_7621151Has your husband been diagnosed with type II diabetes along with cirrhosis? It\u2019s not an uncommon association; his doctor can test his blood sugar and help him assess this. A burning or \u2018pins and needles\u2019 feeling in the feet is often a result of peripheral neuropathy; this in turn can be a symptom of poorly controlled, long standing diabetes. There are other causes to look at but this is likely the most common given his situation.His doctor may order blood tests and if diabetes is an issue, it can generally be controlled via diet, exercise and sometimes medication.The nosebleeds and swelling of the ankles (edema?) may be explained from his cirrhosis; nosebleeds often result from severely reduced blood platelets that manage clotting; the swelling of the ankles is common when cirrhosis is present.He needs to consult with either his primary care or liver doctor; these can all be yellow flags, and shouldn\u2019t be ignored.Best of luck to you both,--Bill",

I am so glad to find people who really care to help others understand. I pray for each and every one of you including my husband who is going through this. I will let my husband know about your comment.",

Feeling very tired and he complains to me he feels like he doesn't have much time left. It hurts me so much to hear him say this. I wish he wouldn't speak that way. I don't want to lose him. I'll make an appointment with his Doctor and I hope he goes. He can't wear shoes anymore because of the ankle swelling.",

            "answer": "The pain and sensitivity in your husbands feet is most likely Neuropathy from Diabetes. It happens when the glucose (sugar) is not being controlled with diet, or meds. After awhile your husband needs to take some personal responsibility for himself. I am sorry you have to watch your loved one suffer though and I would like to suggest that Ala-Non would be much better suited your\u00a0\u00a0needs. After awhile as the Neuropathy progresses your husbands feet will lose the sensitivity and just feel numb, if I am correct. I can only say what I have gone through with my feet. No, mine is not from drinking. Get the bloodsugar in order and the health will follow. Good luck to you dear.",
