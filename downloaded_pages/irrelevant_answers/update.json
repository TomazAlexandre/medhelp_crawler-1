            "answer": "Hi capermom, Im doing good. Im in my 9th week. Most of the nasea has gone away,but Im still pretty tired. Although not as tired as a couple weeks ago. Ive had2 u/s and both were good. Saw heartbeat. Had my glucose test and it came out normal. Now I just have to keep my fingers crossed for the test at 24 wks. (I had gestational Diabetes last pregnancy). But overall Im doing great. This pregnancy seems easier than my first two. I hope things get better for you. I know how hard it is to work and feel sick all the time. It got so bad for me with my last baby that I took a 6 week medical leave. Has twins been ruled out yet? It sounds like it could be a possibility....Well good luck. It was nice hearing from you again...",

    "question": "Hi everyone, sorry I haven't been around, been working lots and feeling really sick and tired. I'm in my eighth week now, showing quite obviously, break outs on my face, morning sickness that last all day and night and so tired and cranky. I just can't get enough sleep and I keep waking up early in the morning to go to the bathroom and can't get back to sleep until I have to get up. Boy, it sucks. Oh and the heartburn! I don't think there is one person that I work with that hasn't looked down and noticed my belly, they think I am having twins (((gulp))). I think there is alot going on this week with the baby and that is why I am so sick. My nipples feel like they are on fire at times and one boob feels like it's bruised or something. oooch. Anyway, other then that, lol; I'm fine.How are you Chloe? Haven't had a chat with you in a long time.How are all the other TTC'ers doing?How are all you mommies to be feeling anyway?",
