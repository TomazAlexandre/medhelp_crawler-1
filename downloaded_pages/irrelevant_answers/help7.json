            "answer": "Welcome to the MedHelp forum!Hypertension, diabetes, strokes or transient ischemic attacks too should be looked into. This can be ruled out by a CT scan or MRI. If TIA is suspected then all predisposing factors to TIA should be ruled out like polycythemia vera, sickle cell disease, diabetes, hyperviscosity syndromes, hypertension etc.The other possibility is cervical nerve root compression very high up. The third possibility is seizures.You need to consult a neurologist ASAP.Hope this helps. Take care!",
