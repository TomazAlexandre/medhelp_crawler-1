            "answer": "Hello,The second lump may be a boil or a carbuncle. Boils are caused by infection of the hair follicle by staph aureus.Hair follicles that are blocked by greasy creams, petroleum jelly, or similar products are more vulnerable to infection. Bacterial skin infections can be spread by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close human contact, or by contact with pus from a boil or carbuncle.In your case,it could have been from pus from the abscess.Pls keep the area clean and apply some warm compresses. Also wear loose-fitting cotton clothing and use an antibacterial soap or mild soap like dove.Avoid any kind of cosmetics. Topical antibiotics such as mupirocin or neomycin containing ointment are also useful.In case the symptoms persist then oral antibiotics may be needed.Pls consult a dermatologist in that case.Also get your blood sugar levels estimated as recurrent boils or abscess may be found in diabetes.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted if you have any additional doubts.",
