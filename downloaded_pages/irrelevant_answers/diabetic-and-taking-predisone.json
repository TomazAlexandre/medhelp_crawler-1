            "answer": "\"My boyfriend didnt have to take any medications for his blood sugar( being diabetic),then a DR. gave him predisone and his blood sugar went to 496\"This statement raises a lot of questions in need of answers. Without them it is difficult to provide proper answers.1. What was your boyfriend doing to control and manage his diabetes without the aide of medication?2. What were his daily glucose levels before prednisone?3. What was the reason for the prednisone?4. What is he doing to control and manage his diabetes?5. How often and when does he test his levels?6. Why are you posting and not him?Prednisone taken over a period of weeks is known to elevate glucose levels, not immediately after. If he has been taking prednisone for sometime he cannot cold turkey off it or internal damages will occur - one has to slowly wean off. His doctor should have explained this and/or provided written documentation.High glucose levels can cause confusion in patients. This appears to be your boyfriends current enemy, uncontrolled and unmanaged diabetes. This is the time he needs to take control and reel back his compulsive food urges by not eating or drinking sugary foods, eating foods high in carbohydrates, or eating junk foods. All of this is contributing to his current high levels and defeats the oral medication. He may need to go on short term insulin to get his levels lower. I suggest a referral to an Endocrinologist, a doctor who specializes in diabetes care and prevention. An endo is much more knowledgeable than a primary or ER doctor. Someone needs to sit him down and explain his self destruction with his current lifestyle and to get him on the right path. Good luck",

    "question": "My boyfriend didnt have to take any medications for his blood sugar( being diabetic),then a DR. gave him predisone and his blood sugar went to 496,we went to another er & they gave him 8 units of insulin via iv drip.A few hrs after this then went back up to 300 -400 again.This was 2 1/2 wks ago-also ER DR put him on glucophage 500mg bid,which has not helped.his blood sugars are still ranging between 200 to 400.He is eating more then usual also eating foods he doesnt even like-he is just not acting \"his usual self\",he gets confused.Is this still related to predisone hes 6'1 240 lbs.(the new er we went to after all this started the dr daid was d/t the predisone,also didnt know how long would take for the predisone to get out of his system.Getting him to go to dr's is very hard then after all that occurred made it worse.Could there be another reason for this-his blood sugars still high,even with medication,which is now 1000 mg bid & not helping.Any ideas on this? Ty for any help",
