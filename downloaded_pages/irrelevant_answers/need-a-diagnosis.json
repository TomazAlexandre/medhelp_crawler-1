            "answer": "Hi there. You need to be investigated for a pituitary adenoma. Numbness, tingling hands arms and legs can be due to a compressed nerve, proplapsed disc, etc. seizure needs to be investigated with an EEG. This could be due to pituitary tumor also. An MRI brain along with other presenting complaints and a detailed ophthalmological evaluation is required to rule out any chiasmal involvement. Diabetes, B complex deficiency and lastly multiple sclerosis to check if it is causing the tingling and numbness in the limbs. Consult a neurologist soon with these concerns. Hope this helps. Take care.",
