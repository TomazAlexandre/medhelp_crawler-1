Diabetes too. All clues.I found this medical paper:OBJECTIVE: The brain-gut axis has been proposed to influence symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between gastrointestinal symptoms and the effect of CRH on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis using a weight-adjusted low-dose dexamethasone test in a group of healthy individuals (n = 157).",

    "question": "on behalf of mum; 6 years ago she had macular degen., misdiagnosed as something else -\u00a0\u00a0cant remember - led down the path of cortisone treatment [the 'dr''s an a55] --> eye problems --> depression --> diabetes.3 years later - over to her endocrinologist: found a pituitary tumor - said to be benign and not a concern. well, I'M CONCERNED. how can you have a pituitary tumour and blow it off as harmless. she has DIARRHEA as well which i'm sure is linked to some endocrinology that the endo isn't picking up. she is UNDERWEIGHT though slightly built. this isn't good enough. she eats a lot and isn't a healthy weight. other than that, she seems well.pituitary/ bowel link?if you can direct me to a site that she can look at that'd be great... thanks",
