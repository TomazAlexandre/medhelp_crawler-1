            "answer": "Artery disease is when the arteries become inflamed and lined with unwanted materials such as fats. Fats can also be buried in the artery wall, held there by a plaque (calcium) covering built by the body. These days many extra years are added to many patients lives by modern medicines and intervention techniques. These range from bypass/stents to beta blockers/statins. It is actually very common for diabetes and CAD to go hand in hand. I had my first attack in 2007 aged 46 and I am now 53. I am still fitter than I thought I would be but that's thanks to the medications I take. My arteries are a mess but some patients just get one or two blockages, receive stents, then live the rest of their natural lives without any issues. All the above conditions you list are controllable by medications. On a last note, \"high blood pressure\". When you have HBP it is important to have meds to keep this normal because it will make artery disease worse. The pounding of high pressure blood on artery walls will cause more disease over time.",

            "answer": "blood flow restriction to an organ in the body. In other words, an artery partial/full blockage. If an artery has been fully blocked then the heart muscle supplied by that artery will be dead. However, in some cases an artery will be bypassed when blocked by tiny vessels called collaterals. This is why an angiogram or ct-angio are needed to look inside the arteries. Some cardiologists go just by symptoms. SO if a patient feels not too bad, then medications will be used to reduce those symptoms.",
