            "answer": "I had gestational diabetes with two of my children, but the diet worked for me. I was told that insulin was the only thing they can give you. The reason I asked was my mother is a diabetic and is on glucaphage and the dietition said that those kinds of medicines are not an option when pregnant. If you truly are concerned I would try to speak with a diabetic nurse and she what she says some times there more knowledgeable in those areas than our doctors. Hope this is helpful.Brandy",

            "answer": "Well the above statement is not true. Not that your doctor/midwife didn't say this brandy. I believe they did\u00a0\u00a0and probably just didnt know. Insulin is the drug of choice if your Diabetes is COMPLETELY out of wack.I have had diabetes with both pregnancies. With my first I took glyburide alone twice a day. With my second, current pregnancy glyburide wasn't cutting it so they added metformin to the mix, same as glucophage, just different name.So right now I take 5mg of glyburide in the am along with 500mg metformin. Then at night 7.5mg of glyburide. This seems to do the trick so far. Gestational diabetes gets worse as pregnancy progresses so I might eventually have to go on insulin. I pray not.OB's are very knowledgable about diabetes and things like this. Most likely though if you have Gestational diabetes you need to be seen by a high risk OB to manage your meds and to watch the growth of the baby closely as diabetes can cause big babies.My first dd was 7lb 3oz, 3 wks early.",

            "answer": "Also lol... Just wanted to mention. When you start this medicine make sure you are following a decent diet and eating plan. Learn the signs of hypoglycemia. Before I learned how the meds affected me and when my sugar would drop as low as into the 30's.",
