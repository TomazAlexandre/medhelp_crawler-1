            "answer": "Hi Cynthia,In general, morning fastings consistently below 70 and above 150 should be addressed. The lower numbers are more worrisome because you can have bad effects quickly(like passing out), so I suggest talking over those 60's with your doctor. Morning levels of 120's are not perfect, but not bad. Most\u00a0\u00a0doctors are comfortable with patients going to bed with blood sugars between 100-200. Lower than that may risk going even lower at night, and higher is not good either. But the course of action, if any is to be taken, will depend on what medications you take, and your eating habits.I suggest you contact your doctor soon to discuss the glucose readings and go over your dietary habits. One or both likely need to be altered.Take care.",

            "answer": "Gary, you didn't mention if you are taking insulin. If you are, and your doctor has told you how to do it, you can possibly CONTROL your blood sugar levels throughout the day and night. \"Normal\" levels are about 85-90. If they go too high, irreplaceable beta cells in the pancreas will die and your diabetic condition will get worse. If they go too low (maybe 50-70), you can become hyperglycemic. There is a wide variation between different people as far as what makes them \"sick.\" That's one reason why treating diabetes is often so difficult -- what works for one person may not work for another. The answers to most of your questions are at www.diabetes-book.com .",
