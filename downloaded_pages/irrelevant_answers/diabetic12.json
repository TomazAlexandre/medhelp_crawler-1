            "answer": "Hi,Yes diabetes can lead to problems with itching for various reasons. The simplest is just dry skin, in which case some lotions may help(oatmeal based lotions are especially good). Other things to be on the look-out for include yeast infections on the skin, eczema, and more concerning would be liver problems that may cause itching. If you have any skin discoloration, I suggest speaking with your doctor to ensure none of the more serious problems may be present.Take care.",
