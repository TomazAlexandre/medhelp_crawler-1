            "answer": "My test is in 9 days! Yikes! My midwife told me that with gestational diabetes, if you don't control your carbohydrate and sugar load that your pancreas goes into overdrive and then the baby's pancreas starts working for your body which is dangerous for baby.If you can cut out carbs as much as you can (preferably the bad carbs) and NO cokes... Not even the diet kind... The artificial sweeteners trick your tongue but not your brain and typically it'll just make you crave more sweet.\u00a0\u00a0Replace the cokes with water.I'm not an expert by any means but I'm a high risk because my maternal grandma and aunt are diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I've grown up having to test my sugar constantly and learn what is safe and not safe for diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0Heck my grandma almost died from a diabetic coma near death experience (she was in the hospital for 12 weeks).\u00a0\u00a0So bottom line... It CAN be serious but if you make the proper diet changes (i.e. no cokes, less carbs, no high fructose corn syrup, watch your fruit/juice intake) there should be no reason to worry.\u00a0\u00a0Drink more water & excercise too. :)So, now that I've given you all this fabulous info let's see how my blood sugar is in 9 days! I tested my fasting sugar the other day at my grandma's and I was at the low end of normal but I'm not exactly surehow the test works.Anyway, good luck! Don't worry, just stay positive! Make positive changes for you and baby! :D",

            "answer": "Well in my last doc visit I had sugar in my urine,\u00a0\u00a0she asked what I had had for breakfast I told her I had on orange and a banana with 2 slices of toast, with a tea with a suger in it! So she said their was allot of carbs and thats prob why their was sugar present when they tested it. But I have to go for a glucose tolerance test Wednesday just to make sure thats what it is! . . .
