            "answer": "@sweetmila, NST is non stress test monitoring. You go into a room with a recliner in it. The nurse will put two bands around your belly: one to monitor baby's heartbeat and the other to monitor possible contractions. You lay back in the recliner and the machine is beside you while you listen to your baby's heart for a certain amount of time. Some nurses may have you press a button for every time you feel your baby move.",
