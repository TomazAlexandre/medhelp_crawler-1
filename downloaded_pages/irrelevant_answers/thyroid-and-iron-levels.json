            "answer": "By low thyroid level, I assume you are referring to the TSH.\u00a0\u00a0A TSH of 6 is only borderline hypothyroid and is not likely to lead to changes in the iron level.To further evaluate the iron level, you may want to consider more comprehensive iron tests including a ferritin and total iron binding capacity.\u00a0\u00a0If the ferritin is markedly elevated, diseases like hemochromatosis can be considered.These options can be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Kevin, M.D.http://www.straightfromthedoc.com",

            "answer": "Iron disorders (both too little/anemia and too much/hemochromatosis) are more common in hypothyroid patients. To make things more difficult the symptoms of hypothyroidism and hemochromatosis overlap and can be confusing.\u00a0\u00a0Have you had other iron tests?\u00a0\u00a0Transferrin saturation?\u00a0\u00a0Ferritin?\u00a0\u00a0If the doc suspects hemochromatosis, they can order a liver biopsy or genetic testing to confirm.\u00a0\u00a0You could ask the doc about donating blood -- that brings down the iron content.",
