I am following the diet, carb counting and all that but my sugars are still to high. I already have to poke myself 4 times a day and now my doctors office called me this past Friday and told me they wasn't me on insulin injections to come in Monday. I really was hoping they would start me on an insulin pill but nope, I just really don't like needles and not sure how many times a day I will have to do that or for how long.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter is measuring a bit big, I just want her to be ok.",

            "answer": "Oh no im sorry to hear that :( im sure your baby girl will be just fine :) my mama had gd with me and my brothers. She hates needles too but she said it helped knowing it was for us :) hopefully you wont have to be on it for long. AND a positive is they won't make you wait till 40 weeks to have her. Theyll take her early. So you get to meet her that much sooner :) thats how ive had to view my choleostasis (liver disorder) I get to meet my son a full week earlier because of it :)",
