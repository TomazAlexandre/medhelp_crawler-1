Calm...no...I am tallgirl...Jerry's wife...I got this all mixed up when I asked a question for him...now he has his own profile and I seem to have lost mine...trying to straighten it out.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for replying...I will relay the message to him. He eats so much, so often and I am not sure he knows how to balance what he eats.\u00a0\u00a0Learning every day how to deal with this.\u00a0\u00a0He is a thin type and needs to put on a few pounds since he lost quite a bit while his sugars were high.\u00a0\u00a0That will come in time, I imagine, once his sugar is under control.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again.",

            "answer": "Thanks for posting back and clarifying who you are. Is Jerry eating \"so much, so often\" because he's hungry or trying to gain back lost weight in a hurry? If the latter, Jerry needs to know that binge eating does more harm than good and what he eats plays a large part in glucose levels. Glucose spikes -\u00a0\u00a0rapid high then rapid dropping - is hard on the cardio system. That is why I say well proportioned meals, eat until one feels full and then stop. Let the food digest then eat again in a couple of hours only if you feel hungry. The weight gain will soon follow once the body stops combating and trying to compensate for bad habits. Google \"diabetic nutrition\" for lots of tips on what to eat and what not to eat (bad carbs).HTH",

            "answer": "My understanding of diabetes nutrition is that there are general guidelines, but no one right way. It is not rigid like \"eat three servings of this at this time\". Within the general guidelines of healthy eating you need to see what works for you. To me, the best way to do that is \"test, test, test\". When I was first diagnosed I was \"required\" to test two times: first thing in the morning and two hours after breakfast. But I tested more..much more so I could learn the effect of how, when and what I ate. For me, the diet part wasn't hard because it is fairly similar to how I eat anyway. For me, eating every couple hours would not work for many reasons. I eat three meals a day. But testing enabled me to know when and what to eat. I learned how much \"leeway\" I have with my eating schedule. (I eat every five hours, I can stretch it to 5 1/2 but if I wait 6 hours I will go \"low\". ) I learned that by feeling strange and then testing to find that I was, in fact low. We all have different symptoms of hypoglycemia; mine are fairly subtle.Testing also tells you how different types of food effect your blood sugar. One \"surprise\": I love eggs but know it isn't good for a 60 year old woman to eat eggs daily, so I had previously switched to eating (non-sugar) cereal with fruit during the week and saving eggs for a weekend treat. Well a good bowl of cereal with fruit really jacks up my blood sugar and we don't even want to talk about what another of my favorites-granola with fruit and yogurt does!So that is my advice, to try out different food combinations and see how they effect your numbers. There are no absolutes with diabetes. For example before being diagnosed I would sometimes have a very light lunch such as a salad or cheese and fruit. Well guess what, that was not enough carbohydrates and I found myself low long\u00a0\u00a0before dinner! We do need some carbohydrates!",
