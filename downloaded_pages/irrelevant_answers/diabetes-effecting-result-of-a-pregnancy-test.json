            "answer": "The presence of ketones doesn't effect a hpt. I had ketones in my urine due to being dehydrated from morning sickness, and I continuously tested positive. Diabetes doesn't render false negative pregnancy tests either.if you drink a large amount of any liquid and use the bathroom frequently, you run the risk of diluting your urine.",

    "question": "I read somewhere that diabetes and also the presence of ketones in your urine could possibly cause a false negative result on an hpt. I tried to look for more information on this topic but came up empty. Is this a possibility and if so why?Additionally I'd like to know if there are any reasons for a false negative result besides:1. Testing too early2. Not properly following directions3. Taking the test too late in the day",
