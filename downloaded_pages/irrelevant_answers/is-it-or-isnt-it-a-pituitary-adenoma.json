            "answer": "Hi there,Pituitary adenomas can burst. Also radiologists who read MRI's can miss them too. You can have your second set of films read by another pituitary specialist.So I don't think that you are at square one, but you need to find another doctor. One willing to do the right testing and knows what they are doing. It is so sad. During the time that I have been involved with MedHelp there have hundreds of folks in your same position. These are ordinary people from all over the country who know that something is wrong with their hormones and have symptoms like yours, but they don't have the right type of doctor.The fact that you are having nipple discharge might indicate that your prolactin level is elevated. Has this been tested recently? Your symptoms could point to your hormones being off too. You already know that your thyroid is not behaving. But then you say your labs are normal.Have you seen a neuroendocrinologist? That is a special type of endocrinologist that specializes in pituitary/adrenal cases. Regular endos usually treat patient with diabetes and non-complex thyroid cases. There are only about 15 neuroendos in the country worth a darn. Some larger medical center have Pituitary Centers. UCLA, UCSF, Stanford, Mass General and so on.How can I help you?Horselip",

            "answer": "I agree with Horsey - you need to get someone decent at a pit center to read the film too as they can see things the radiologist misses.As well, you may not be tested well enough to know what is going on - prolactin can be raised with thyroid issues and so the thyroid needs to be examined closely. Most docs run the panel and it is not good enough.I would also go see a neuro-opthomalogist and get your eyes really checked out with visual fields too.",
