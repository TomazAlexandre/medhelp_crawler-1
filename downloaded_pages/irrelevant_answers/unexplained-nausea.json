    "question": "I have been experiencing unexplained nausea on and off for the past 5 months or so.\u00a0\u00a0It started off with a sudden attack of it during a really stressful time, but the other times I've gotten it I wasn't stressed out, so I don't think that's what's causing it.\u00a0\u00a0For a couple of weeks, I had some other symptoms along with it, like tachycardia and lightheadedness.\u00a0\u00a0It was really frustrating and annoying because I had an echocardiogram and a head CT scan and both showed no problems.\u00a0\u00a0Now I'm basically just getting the nausea, with the other symptoms only occasionally.\u00a0\u00a0I have no abdominal pain at all and cannot notice a correlation with any particular foods that I eat.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know what this could be??\u00a0\u00a0I'm really tired of it becuase it gets so bad sometimes that I don't even want to go anywhere because I'm afraid I'll throw up everywhere (which has happened once ;-s)",
