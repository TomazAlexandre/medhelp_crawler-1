            "answer": "It will eventually go away after going thru some color changes.\u00a0\u00a0May take a while.You did the right thing with the pressure and the ice.\u00a0\u00a0You are not likely to die from that small amount of bleeding, so you wouldn't have needed 911.\u00a0\u00a0Picture in your mind a whole cup full of blood-even that amount is only 240cc's, and people who donate blood give almost twice that amount!\u00a0\u00a0Saturating a couple of tissues probably contains at most 20cc of blood.Are you taking aspirin or any kind of blood thinner?\u00a0\u00a0That may have contributed to it.\u00a0\u00a0But what you did was just right--hold firm pressure (without letting up to peek and see if it stopped) for AT LEAST 5 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0If that doesn't stop it, hold firm pressure for 10 more minutes.I'm sorry you had that problem!",

            "answer": "Tony,I had a very similar experience a few years ago ... except that when I took out my cannula the bubble was sort of a geiser!\u00a0\u00a0I felt like a blood \"old faithful\" squirtin' out waay to much blood.\u00a0\u00a0The thing about blood is that even a little looks like A LOT when it's outside our bodies.What we had done to cause all that was simply to break a capillary while removing the cannula.\u00a0\u00a0In my mind's eye, I imagine that the cannula was right next to a capillary the whole time it was in me, but the process of removing it put just the right (or wrong!) pressure against it to spring a leak.The pressure & ice were exactly right and soon your body will reabsorb the \"color.\"That gusher experience has, thankfully, only happened once to me.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a handful of bruises that didn't result in any surface bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0Inevitably, if I see one of those, I really DO need to change the infusion site because soon the blood will find its way UP the cannula (my basal rate is pretty low, so I may be more susceptible to such \"backflow\").Anyway ... hope the scare is a fading memory soon.",

            "answer": "Dear Tony,While I have a son with type one and don't have alot of knowledge about pumps, I do have rheumitoid arthritis.\u00a0\u00a0I give myself two injections with fairly long needles twice a week and have hit wrong a couple of times. You took care of it as I have been advised.\u00a0\u00a0What I would like to explain, is in regards to the bruising. It will go away, at least with my experience. It is just blood that spreads under the skin.\u00a0\u00a0If you have further concerns, please speak to your doctor about it.Please don't let this get you down. Try to look at the big picture and try and stay positive. I think a positive outlook to any disease (no matter how hard) is the way to go.Best of luck,dm",

Sigh ....I'm nervous about removing my next one now.\u00a0\u00a0In a week I have to rotate back to that side.\u00a0\u00a0:^(I read where, to reduce the bruising, to put a warm compress on the bruise location for like 20 minutes twice a day.\u00a0\u00a0It's supposed to circulate the blood in the area to flush it out of the skin where it seeped under.\u00a0\u00a0Dunno if that works or not, but I'm trying it.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise, I put neosporin on the area and try not to look at it.You know - it seems whenever I feel like I'm getting used to all of this and start to accept my new life and what I have to do .... something like this happens and kicks me to the ground.\u00a0\u00a0:^(\u00a0\u00a0Why can't bad things just leave me alone for awhile ....",

            "answer": "This exact thing happened to me when I first got my insulin pump. I actually had it happen 3 times within the first 6 months and each time it totally freaked me out. I called the 24 hour phone number on the back on my pump (mine is a Minimed 508) and they told me to try changing to a shorter cannula. The old one was 9mm but now I use the micros (6mm).\u00a0\u00a0I switched to the smaller cannula maybe 18 months ago and have not had any \"gushers\" since.\u00a0\u00a0I'm an average to thin person who exercises alot and they said that I probably should have been using the micros from the start.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps!",

I will never say diabetes is easy..or things could be worse. I will say that I am lucky this disease is not going to take my son from me as long as we take great care of him and his needs.

    "question": "This morning I really had a scare.\u00a0\u00a0Everything was going fine for an infusion set change.\u00a0\u00a0New site went in without issue.The old site on the other side of my abdomen however - when I went to pull out the QuickSet - it came out fine.Then a big bubble of blood appeared out the cannula spot and it bled and bled and bled.\u00a0\u00a0Never seen so much blood.\u00a0\u00a0I grabbed a wad of tissues and applied direct pressure twice.\u00a0\u00a0It soaked them and then finally stopped.\u00a0\u00a0Tried to get ice on it to stop it from seeping under the skin but was too late.I was so scared it wouldn't stop and was ready to call 911 I was so scared.But it stopped after a minute - but left a dark circle around where the cannula had been and a tan bruise the size of a thumbnail around it.\u00a0\u00a0A real big pump bump.\u00a0\u00a0Not one that neosporin or peroxide is going to take care of.Anyone have any remedies to make the bruising and dark circle go away.\u00a0\u00a0Best I can tell is that I may have hit a tiny capulary or something.There was so much blood .....I thought I had all this down.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't hurt now and isn't bleeding - but it looks horrible.\u00a0\u00a0And it WOULD have to happen the day my endo's office is closed.I hate this.\u00a0\u00a0I really hate this.\u00a0\u00a0The bruising will go away right?\u00a0\u00a0I'm not going to get a scar from that dark circle?\u00a0\u00a0This really has me shook up.",
