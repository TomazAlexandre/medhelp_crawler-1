Hashimoto's is known to occur more frequently in people with related conditions, such as Sjogren's, Lupus, or even diabetes, which are also linked to temperature regulation problems.Thyroid problems can definitely cause it but if your thyroid is under control and your temperature issues haven't improved, you might want to go back to your doctor to look for another condition that could be contributing to it.This article has lists of possible causes and it might be helpful for you.http://www.buzzle.com/articles/body-temperature-regulation-problems.htmlI hope you find an answer soon!",

    "question": "Hello,I am a 19 year old Caucasian female and I'm having problems regulating my body temperature.\u00a0\u00a0I live in the far northern area of the U.S. and in the winter, my body feels extremely cold and sluggish.\u00a0\u00a0I wear an excessive number of layers of clothing and sleep under 5 blankets, but I still feel so cold that it seems like my body shuts down, it's hard to move, and I feel sleepy all the time.\u00a0\u00a0Then in the summer the temperature gets up to the mid 80's, and when I go outside I instantly start sweating.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I'm overheating even in the shade, and I have fainted from the heat several times.\u00a0\u00a0I have also noticed that I sweat excessively when I exercise.\u00a0\u00a0After running only one mile, my face and arms are drenched in sweat, and the friend that I run with has only tiny beads of sweat on her forehead.\u00a0\u00a0My thyroid has been tested several times and I have been diagnosed with Hashimoto's, though my TSH levels are normal and my thyroid appears to be functioning normally despite the autoimmune disease.\u00a0\u00a0It has also been determined that I have a very high metabolism, but I'm not sure if that really relates to these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Any help would be greatly appreciated!",
