            "answer": "Hi Kitty,Glad to hear that you are doing well. I was wondering where you were - haven't seen you around.It seems alot of the doctors lean towards Lexapro on forum and from what I have read. Lexapro doesn't seem to work for everyone so its good that you mentioned this drug for those that may be looking for an Ad or looking to switch.Take care!",

            "answer": "Hello,Are you having neuropathic pain that you believe is related to the Hep C? Hope I read that right. Why I ask is because I do, and would like to find others that do to compare notes . The Docs say it's not related but I find that hard to believe do to all the research out there that backs up the possibility that the virus is directly related in some cases.Thats great that you started cymbalta prior to starting treatment I did the same about one month prior.I was taking cymbalta for neuro pain prior to dx of the Hep c.Good luck in treatment,your proactive approach will help.Harry",

I was on Lyrica then cymbalta and now effexor, the Docs bounced me around trying to find a antidepressant that they all could agree on. I owe alot to these antidepressants, they didn't make me hyper but calmed the mind down so I could think.Good Luck on treatment.Harry",
