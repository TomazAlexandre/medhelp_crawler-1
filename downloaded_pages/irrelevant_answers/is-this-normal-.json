            "answer": "Are you thinking about it alot? Because thinking about peeing and or even thinking why you have been peeing can possibly cause your brain to think you have to pee.. maybe thats a possibility. I was late by 4 days too. I felt the same way and Im still on my AF and still kind of feel that way.. so I wouldnt think to much of it.",

            "answer": "It could be a lot of things. I would make a dr appointment just to be on safe side. Increase thirst(polydipsia) and peeing(polyuria) could be a sign of diabetes. Being all of this stuff is controlled by the endocrine system its hard to say without getting checked out. I hope its nothing major, keep us posted.",

            "answer": "thankkkkss! you know come to think about it, a few years ago the doctors thought I might have been diabetic. My head kept getting really heavy and such.. But my heads not doing that now.... Just random lightheaded, nausea, going to bed tired waking up tired, and peeing a LOOTTT. But, I dont drink as much.. I'm always thristy.. just dont drink that much because if i'm already peeing this much can't imagine what would happen if I did. lol. All this happened before AF. And it's just continuing through it. So I'm not sure what it is either.. If it doesn't go away soon, I'll make a doctors appt. :)",

    "question": "Here we go... AF was late by 4 days. I have been peeing soooo much! Seems to be EVERY 15-30 minutes.Seems to be this way according to my friend. She thinks It's been this way for a week now. It's rather annoying!! It doesn't hurt when I pee or itch. So I'm not sure what it could be. I still get to feeling a little nauseated after I eat sometimes. It's not bad though. Lastnight, (and this happens often and as I'm typing this actually) I'll be watching tv or something and out of nowhere I'll feel lightheaded. It lasts just a few minutes then I'm ok. I've passed one small clot so far. Strangely enough, I've had no cramps really with this AF. I'll have a few twinges and pinching feelings toward the left side but that's about it. If I do get a cramp, it's so light I barely feel it and lasts for 3 seconds. Either I'm really fortunate to have a \"behaved\" AF or I dont know lol!! Anyways, back to what I'm saying. haha. Anyone have an idea on why I pee soo much! I dont constantly drink things, but I'm always thirsty. I seriously wish I knew the answer because I'm peeing soooo much that my mother-n-law asked if there is anything I need to tell her. Even my best friend tells me somethings wrong with me. LOL. So anything from you ladies would be nice to hear. haha.",
