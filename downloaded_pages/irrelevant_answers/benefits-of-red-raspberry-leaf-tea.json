    "question": "Red Raspberry Leaf tea has a soft raspberry fragrance and robust taste similar to black tea, with sweet undertones. The tea may be served hot or as an iced tea. Commonly used by women, raspberry leaf tea helps aid irregular menstration and menstral cramps. It is one of the safest and most commonly used herbs for women wanting to get pregnant, or for women who are already pregnant. Red Raspberry Leaf tones the uterus, improves contractions and decreases constipation. Contemporary herbalists recommend red raspberry leaf for diarrhea and to treat nausea and vomiting, especially the morning sickness of pregnancy. One study shows that red raspberry leaf helps reduce blood sugar glucose, suggesting possible value in diabetes management. Other cases suggest that it increases fertility in men as well.",
