            "answer": "Well, you are old enough to make decisions. Your weight is kind of high for your age. It's very difficult to lose weight. It is often not a question of willpower. Don't be blaming yourself. Often there is a problem with the endochrine system. Talk with your mom or dad about an appointment with an endochronologist, who will evaluate your diabetic status and provide suggestions for weight loss.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You definitely need an evaluation by an endocrine specialist. It can be due to diabetes even if fasting and post meal blood sugar levels are normal\u2014you could be having insulin resistance or impaired glucose metabolism.Other than that it can be due to severe acidity, stress, depression, worms in gut, and polycystic ovary.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Talk to your therapist and home tutors. Maybe they can make your parents understand you need an evaluation. Take care!",
