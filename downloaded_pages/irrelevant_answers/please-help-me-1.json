            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Exercise intolerance is generally due to heart conditions such as aortic valve insufficiency and cardiac arrhythmia. Go for a holter test and see. Resting EKG may be normal. Also a heart ECHO will need to be done. COPD or chronic obstructive lung disease is another cause and pulmonary function tests should be done. Chronic fatigue syndrome, anemia, obesity, thyroid problems and diabetes are the other possibilities.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

            "answer": "thanks for your reply!I already had a pulmonary function test and they didn't find anything.I was never given an ECHO of my heart, I am assuming it is because the resting EKG was normal, so they moved on. No holter test either.I am pretty much looking for my own theories at this point, because it seems to me that the doctors i've been seeing aren't taking it as seriously as they should be. So i'm making a list of what I want my doctor to consider.Thanks so much for your help!",

    "question": "My name is Carly and i'm 17. I have been looking for a diagnosis for the past 3 years.the most alarming problem that I have is an intolerance to physical exertion. I have alot of trouble exercising and nobody knows why. As soon as I start to get a good work out, my heart beats REALLY fast and sometimes palpitates, I get dizzy and clammy and start to black out, my skin gets all splotchy and red, and my whole body just feels like its in shock or something. Its really miserable :(I am in marching band and I keep having to sit out when practice gets hard and i'm sick of it.so far my doctors have given me multiple ekg's to rule out anything with my heart, my lungs are very healthy ( seeing as I am a vocalist). I've had an exercise test, but they only focused on my heart/lungs/blood pressure.I am requesting\u00a0\u00a0to see an endocrinologist as the next step. Does anyone have any ideas as to what else I should consider?",
