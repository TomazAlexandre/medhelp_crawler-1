            "answer": "Is it important to know?\u00a0\u00a0Yes and no!As you stated, the treatment for Hashi's is the same as the treatment for hypo.\u00a0\u00a0So, whether or not you have Hashi's should not delay or change your treatment.On the other hand, as you also said, AI diseases tend to run in families, and it's not necessarily the same AI.\u00a0\u00a0For example, I know a family that has Hashi's, PA, lupus and type I diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0So, it's important information to know for family members and your own future health issues.\u00a0\u00a0Once we have more than one AI, we are much more likely to develop a second or third than the general population is to have its first.The markers for Hashi's are TPOab (thyroid peroxidase antibodies) and TGab (thyroglobulin antibodies).\u00a0\u00a0Most of us, by far, are TPOab positive, many both, and a few only TGab positive.\u00a0\u00a0So, you have to test both to get a true negative, although positive TPOab is considered a sufficient basis for a diagnosis of Hashi's.Ask away...that's why we're here!",

            "answer": "There are a number of clinical trials published in medical journals that shows selenium can lower thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb). Not everyone will see results but i have personally seen results eating brazil nuts (highest natural source of selenium).\u00a0\u00a0Studies show selenium may slow down the progression of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.The following info is from a book \"The Everything Guide To Thyroid Disease\" by Theodore C. Friedman, MD, PhD and Winnie Yu Scherer.\"Although the majority of people with Hashimoto's will not develop any other disorders, it's important to know what some of these autoimmune conditions are in case you do start to experience symptoms. Keep in mind, too, that you may be more likely to develop Hashimoto's if you have one of these other conditions.Type 1 diabetesPernicious AnaemiaAddison's DiseaseVitiligoCeliac DiseaseAlopecia AretaSystematic Lupus Erthematosus (SLE)Rheumatoid ArthritisSjogren's SyndromeInflammatory Bowel DiseaseMultiple Sclerosis (MS)\"Autoimmune thyroid disease (either Graves' disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis) may show up with a positive or negative ANA titer.\u00a0\u00a0One study on Hashimoto's thyroiditis found 47% were ANA positive. Of them, 60% showed a titer of 1:40.\u00a0\u00a0I personally have a negative ANA and have autoimmune pernicious anaemia, vitiligo, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis.",

    "question": "Hello, I've recently been dx'd with hypothyroidism, have posted here a couple of times and am learning so much from all of you.\u00a0\u00a0My question is this: does it matter if one has hashimoto's or ...what would it be called...hypothyroidism non auto-immune?\u00a0\u00a0The reason I ask is because to me it seems important though I don't know why really if treatment is the same.\u00a0\u00a0I have first degree relatives who had lupus and also RA so it is obviously in my history.\u00a0\u00a0A number of years ago I had some lab work which showed a +ANA.\u00a0\u00a0While I also realize that some people have +ANA tests and still don't have AI, I can't help but wonder if I have AI hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0I mentioned this to the doctor and she didn't think it made a difference.\u00a0\u00a0So, I'm asking if it matters, if so, why does it matter?\u00a0\u00a0How is treatment different?\u00a0\u00a0What test/s determine if hypothyroidism is AI?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your help.I might also add that the doctor with whom I am currently working is a new doctor.\u00a0\u00a0My personal doctor relocated several states away as of Jan.1.\u00a0\u00a0I'd had routine lab work + allergy testing through blood work mid-December, the results were mailed to me in late December stating I had hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor's office suggested I see another doc in the same building, which I did.\u00a0\u00a0I have been once, go back in about four weeks (perhaps sooner as another member suggested).\u00a0\u00a0I am not crazy about this new doctor and am currently looking for another, but in the meantime, I have lots of questions.",
