            "answer": "If you test positive for diabetes, you will probably have one or two more possibly three ultrasounds for growth. Also, make sure they keep an eye on the baby's abdominal circumference as an overly large abdominal circumference is a sign of uncontrolled diabetes with mom and accelerated growth in the baby's torso. On the other hand, if you test negative for diabetes, you just might have a genetically destined big baby. If that were the case, the baby's growth parameters including the head, the belly, and the leg would probably all be symmetrically large. It is under the 10th percentile and over the 90th percentile that can become particularly worrisome.if the baby cruises along in the 70s percentiles, probably no worries. Good luck and keep us posted.",
