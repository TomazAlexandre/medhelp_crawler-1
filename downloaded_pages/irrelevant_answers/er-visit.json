    "question": "I was at work on wed night and all of a sudden I couldn't get enough to drink so I went and drank like 4 big cups of water and about 2 minutes later I was thirsty again ,this went on for a while and then my back started to hurt amd I felt like passing out. It continued to get worse so I left work and had my son drive me to ER and they took 4 tubes of blood and came in and said my sugar and everything looked good. A NS came in and talked to me and I told him I was dx with chiari and he said it was probably pressure in my brain and the only way your body knows how to get rid of it is to constantly urinate and that's why I couldn't get enough to drink.I thought I was getting another kidney stone sice I have had 3 in the last couple of years.. My question is has anyone\u00a0\u00a0ever heard of you body releasing pressure in your brain this way?",
