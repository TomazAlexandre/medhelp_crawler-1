            "answer": "Regarding seeing 'MS' stated on the MRI report, it's important to remember radiologists do not diagnose. They report what they see. A neurologist does the diagnosing when it comes to MS. Also, depending on what section of the report you read this on, it could have been the query section, as in the portion where it's stated what is being looked for.All that aside, you're perfectly right to be taken aback by the discrepancy in what you were told by the neurologist and what is clearly not a 'perfect' MRI. If you can find the will, I'd try to find a third neurologist. I know that must be frustrating and exhausting. A lot of people on this site can really relate to having to kiss a lot of medical frogs before finding that prince.But you've made a very important step in obtaining your own medical records. You can come to the table with objective proof that there is something that needs to be addressed or at an absolute minimum explained more thoroughly to you.Have you spoken to your GP about the possibility of being referred to an MS specialist? Did either of these previous neurologist claim to be such?",

            "answer": "I would find a MS Specialist. Neurologists specialize. No test rules MS in or out. Most neurologists want to see you over time for themselves so it might take awhile to get a diagnosis. It it took me several years with many MRIs showing typical MS.Most neurologists are not big on emotions. It is best to say nothing when they do the neurological exam, reflexes and following the eye. I only got emotional with one neurologist. She fired right then and there. I have learned to just talk when the ask me something or at the end.Numbness in both hands and both feet does not sound like MS. The other symptoms could be. The lesions as well depending on where they are in the brain. The neurologist in the findings part of the report will give suggestions but not a diagnosis.I had a couple of jerky neurologist. My GP told me to forget about it and start over with a new neurologist. Both neurologists I had trouble with were not MS Specialists.AlexA GP also can't diagnose MS it has to be a neurologist. The doctor should do a lot of blood work to rule out any other conditions. They might also do a Lumbar puncture.You have to have two attacks in different parts of the body at different times.It is like court what you say is not as relevant as what the neurologist sees.Use your time wisely. Give the neurologist the other neurologists reports but do not say anything about them. Let the neurologist make his own mind up.",

            "answer": "I never said I had numbness in both extremities at the same time and I don't get emotional at doctor appointments. I dont understand where this is coming from.Yes, feet and hand numbness is a symptom. Here is some info on that from a reliable source because you're mistaken.http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Numbness",

            "answer": "I think it was a simple misunderstanding. You mentioned numbness in your hands and feet. Alex just read it as both hands and both feet. We mean you no harm :-)As imnmi said, your MRI report was likely written by a radiologist. Radiologists suggest possibilities based on their findings. The can tell the difference between demyelinating lesions and those cuased\u00a0\u00a0by ischemia (blood vessel issues). The final determination is made by the doc that ordered the MRI.Finding a good doc can be a real pain in the butt. I tossed my forst MS doc and got very lucky with my second. Many here have been through 6 or more. It stinks but you have to keep at it. There are very good ones out there.I thin the next step, in addition to finding a new doc, is to have follow up MRI in the next 6 months. Make sure it is done both with and without contrast. This will help identify new lesions and old ones. Lesions of at least 2 different ages are an important part of the MS diagnostic process.Ask us lots of questions. We come in peace :-)Kyle",

            "answer": "Hi and welcome to our little MS community,Like Alex I too would of have given you a heads up and also brought up emotion's due to you stating \"in Dec of 2014. I was in tears when I left...\" and you had also stated \"I'm stunned and so angry..\" and lastly ended with \" I'm scared to go to another....\"ALL of which, are totally understandable emotions for anyone to feel, after experiencing what you have!Try to keep in mind that because of your experiences, it would be very, very understandable to be quite sensitive of anything or anyone that makes you feel dismissed all over again etc and if that is happening, your emotions could be more easily provoked when you see another neurologist. Neurologist are more likely to consider someone's symptom history as potentially being psychological, if a person is emotive in anyway during their appointment.It doesn't make much sense considering there are numerous neurological conditions, that do directly effect a persons emotions and or are a secondary issue but dismissal due to someone display of emotions happen's often enough to be mentioned..........Diabetes is a complication in regards to your symptom history, because your diabetes 'could' account for each issue you've mentioned. You will probably already be aware but in case you are not, Diabetes is suppose to be the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy (diabetic neuropathy) and it causes very 'similar' symptoms as those found in central nervous system conditions eg MS but it is a very different medical condition, test evidence and treatment plan. [http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/neuropathies/]I would suggest you bravely see a third neurologist for a full neurological evaluation and under go any testing required. I'd would probably mention at the beginning of the appointment, that your last MRI mentioned you had significant demylination and you would like his/her opinion. btw I definitely wouldn't recommend you mention anything about the other neurologists behaviours or opinions!Cheers..........JJ",

    "question": "Hello,I'm new to the message board. I've had a weird road so far finding answers. Since my 20's I've had off and on numbness in my hands and feet. I never thought much about it because I'm diabetic and it comes with the territory. (I'm good at explaining things away.) I've also had bouts of dizziness and slurred speech, but again, blamed it on low blood sugar and the like. When I was 34 my whole right side went weak and I had slurred speech and confusion. I went to the hospital and was admitted for a possible stroke or TIA. The symptoms went away as they always did and nothing showed on my CT.While there I found an amazing GP who happened to be on call. He did an eye exam and noticed my eyes were sticking and not following his light. He asked me to follow up with him. When I finally went to see him I went over every symptom I had with him and told him I'd been doing some research and wondered about MS. He agreed and said he was thinking along those lines as well. He said he had to send me to a neurologist for a proper diagnosis and finally get me feeling better.Here in started the nightmare. The first neuro I went to was a complete jerk who thought I making this up or I had to be having seizures. He put me through every test for seizures and it came back clean. Sent me for another CT and it was clean. The second time I went to him, he yelled at me for not following his finger with my eyes. Sometimes my eyes lock up when my head is feeling numb. I can't help it. Anyway, I walked out.My GP sent me to another neuro when I came into the office on a below 0 winter day barely able to walk. (My legs tighten so bad in cold weather.) This guy was another jerk, but he did send me for an MRI looking for MS. I go back for my results and he tells me my scan came up perfect with no lesions or tumors and nothing on my spinal cord. This was in Dec of 2014. I was in tears when I left because during all this time my symptoms had worsened. I was having double vision off and on, I can't walk for long periods, fatigue, numbness in my head so severe I would slur my speech and be confused when someone spoke to me.I decided a few days ago to go get my records from the hospital where my tests were done. The MRI clearly states the diagnosis:\u00a0\u00a0Multiple Sclerosis. I have about 6 lesions and \"significant demylinating.\"My last neuro flat out lied to me. I'm stunned and so angry. I've been going through so much and he lied or didn't have the proper results in front of him.So now I have to go back to my GP with my results and be sent to yet another neuro. I'm scared to go to another. Does anyone know what to expect when walking in with papers saying I have MS already?",
