            "answer": "Bill,I'm a long time diabetic and from that perspective, I encourage you to use sites other than your tummy.\u00a0\u00a0Even with rotations, and especially if you're taking multiple injections a day, a normal size human *will* wear out that area.\u00a0\u00a0Just think about it as 365 days a year * number of shots per day * number of years you have/will have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0That number gets huge for spreading around a relatively modest surface area.\u00a0\u00a0When we wear out a site, our absorption will suffer and we may get \"indentations\" or large \"bumps\" in the over-used spots.I haven't been able to use my legs for shots in decades, but I can use arms, butt, and tummy quite easily.\u00a0\u00a0Now that I am pumping, I use tummy & butt.\u00a0\u00a0Rotation is so so important both within an area and among the areas.I'm sure others'll chime in with their experiences.\u00a0\u00a0Using new sites often takes some emotional adjustment (overcoming a \"yuck\" factor! ;-)\u00a0\u00a0) and yet it's quite doable for most of us.Good luck!",

            "answer": "Since I am not a doctor, I can only give advice from personal experience. Some diabetics I have spoken with about injection sites mention that, after years, some areas develop either a slight raising of tissue (almost like a large lump) or in some cases, some tissue atrophy in areas where injections are given. In order to give each area a rest, most doctors do recommend rotating injection sites. However, if you are not comfortable doing this, just watch carefully for any changes, and if you see changes, alter your pattern. Rotating around the area is a good start. Also, you can use the back of the arms, the area that tends to \"flop\" when people are a little heavy or anywhere on the buttock or hip if you can reach it. I personally do not use the legs as often as these other sites for the very reason you write about, sensitivity and sometimes bruising.",

            "answer": "Of all the diagrams I've seem for infusion and injections - I've never seen it for the (pardon me) butt.\u00a0\u00a0I imagine with infusions sets and sitting it may be tough (how would you get the infusion sets out???)Usually just stomach and upper legs .... they show the abdomen out toward the sides, but the muscle there would probably hurt.",

    "question": "I have been putting most my injections in my tummy, since it seems to hurt more in my legs (I haven't even tried the back of the arm yet).\u00a0\u00a0Is it okay to use this one area and rotate around the area?\u00a0\u00a0I know it would be better to use the whole bodies areas for injections, it just seems more inconvenient.",
