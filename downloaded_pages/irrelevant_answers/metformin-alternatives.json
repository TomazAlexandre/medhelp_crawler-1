    "question": "I was diagnosed with PCOS in 2005. I really want to lose weight and I know I gotta take the Metformin but it makes me very nauseous. The diarrhea I can handle but not the nausea, so I haven't been taking it. I see an endocrinologist Wednesday. I was wondering if there's an alternative to Metformin/Glucophage without the nausea side effects. If there's not how long does it take until you get used to the side effects?",
