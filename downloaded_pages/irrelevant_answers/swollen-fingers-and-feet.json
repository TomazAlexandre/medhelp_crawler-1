            "answer": "My mom n law has the same problem only her ankles and feet are affected too. The Dr's told her it was a form of gout and there really is nothing to do except for diuretics. She also takes lasix a pretty high dose and she does not get any relief from it either. She does need pain meds as it is painful but the doc only gives her a few scripts a year, I have urged her time and time again to go to a PM doc and get help but she won't she just deals with the pain when she does not have meds to help her. It is really heart breaking to see someone in that much pain and trusts her doc so much she is unwilling to get further help. Good luck and I really hope your feeling better soon. I would suggest asking if there are any new treatments or clinical trials available.",
