            "answer": "With a test result in only 2 hours, your partner probably had the Biokit HSV-2 test.\u00a0\u00a0It is 90% sensitive, meaning it will miss about 10% of people who in fact have HSV-2 infections.\u00a0\u00a0So there are 3 possibilities.\u00a0\u00a01) Perhaps your partner in fact is infected and his test missed it.\u00a0\u00a02) Your herpes might be due to HSV-1, perhaps acquired by oral sex.\u00a0\u00a0If your partner has HSV-1, the Biokit HSV-2 test won't show it. 3) You have been infected all along and only now had your first recognized outbreak.\u00a0\u00a0This happens a lot:\u00a0\u00a040% of people with apparent initial genital herpes in fact have been infected for several months or even years.\u00a0\u00a0There is no good explanation of why this happens.Acyclovir will not interfere with your diabetes or the medications you take for it.If your symptoms are lasting a month despite acyclovir, the best bet is that the symptoms are not due to herpes.\u00a0\u00a0You might have more than one problem (for example, yeast infections are common in diabetics and the symptoms can be very similar to herpes).\u00a0\u00a0If your herpes infection was only diagnosed visually, you need to have some lab testing to be sure you in fact have an HSV infection.Best wishes--\u00a0\u00a0 HHH, MD",

            "answer": "Herpes is weird. You can have no symptoms at all (or unrecognizable symptoms) for years, maybe even forever.As for the medication interfering with your diabetes meds, I assume your doctor knew what you were taking when s/he prescribed the Aclyvoir. Also, if you had it filled at the same pharmacy you get your diabetes meds, the pharmacist would have caught any potential interaction. You can always call the pharmacy or your doctor to be sure, though.Your symptoms shouldn't last more than a month, even if you weren't taking meds.Hope you feel better soon!",
