            "answer": "As I understand it we are talking overt hypothyroid and subclinical. Here's a bit of a study.Research Journal of Pharmaceutical, Biological and Chemical Sciences Thyroid dysfunction and total cholesterol - experience in a tertiary care hospital\"Hypothyroidism is defined as a deficiency of thyroid hormones resulting from reduced secretion of both T4 and T3 [1]. Biochemically decrease in T4 and T3 concentrations lead to hyper secretion of pituitary TSH and an amplified increase in serum TSH levels. This is a key laboratory finding, particularly in the early detection of thyroid dysfunction [2]. Lipid abnormalities are reported to be more common in patients with overt hypothyroidism and are thought to contribute to the disproportionate increase in cardiovascular risk laboratory finding, particularly in the early detection of thyroid dysfunction [3]. Hence, hypothyroid patients are at high risk of cardiovascular diseases laboratory finding, particularly in the early detection of thyroid dysfunction [4].Levothyroxine replacement therapy significantly improved the lipid profile in hypothyroid patients laboratory finding, particularly in the early detection of thyroid dysfunction [5] indicating the possible relation between thyroid hormones and lipid levels in the blood of hypothyroid patients. Relation between thyroid dysfunction and cardiovascular diseases has been a subject of interest for many clinical investigators for a long time. Overt hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism is the established risk factor for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) but the relation between Subclinical Hypothyroidism (SHT) defined as an elevated Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) with normal thyroid hormones (fT3, & fT4) and hypercholesterolemia related to cardiovascular risk is still controversial laboratory finding, particularly in the early detection of thyroid dysfunction [6,7,8,9]. Thyroid has also important effects and influences in the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and the metabolism of carbohydrate, lipid and proteins laboratory finding, particularly in the early detection of thyroid dysfunction [10]. Hypothyroidism has been generally considered as cardiovascular risk factor in majority of studies, mainly because of its association with elevated Total Cholesterol (TC) and LDL cholesterol. Hypercholesterolemia in hypothyroidism probably results from reduced catabolism of lipoproteins, a phenomenon that may be explained by a decreased expression of lipoprotein receptors laboratory finding, particularly in the early detection of thyroid dysfunction [11]. Hence, it is important to see the relation of total cholesterol and thyroid dysfunction. The result can also be useful for screening thyroid dysfunction in the patient having high total cholesterol level in the serum.Thyroid has important effect in the metabolism of carbohydrate, lipid and proteins. Level of serum total cholesterol is maintained by the level of thyroid hormone through its catabolism, by up regulating or down regulating LDL receptors.\"I think in getting the right balance in FT3 one would get the proper metabolism throughout and that should be considered as well in treating other problems such as cholesterol instead of taking statins and treating all these problems independent of one another. That's why I wondered if anyone who had their FT3 in a good upper normal range also happened to see an improvement in their lipid panel.",

            "answer": "I agree there are many factors. But this may be one that the docs who only look at tsh miss. People who are subclinical hypothyroid probably have rising cholesterol and LDL but often aren't treated for the thyroid which might bring their lipids into normal. On the flip side the Dr won't allow them to get into subclinical hyperthyroid range because of the risk to heart and bone. The 2011 study shows that not to be the case. That's huge...a win win. A patient can get the FT3 in upper range but won't risk osteoporosis if remaining subclinical hyperthyroid and it may correct the lipids, along with proper nutrition and exercise.I just think it's almost irresponsible for Dr not to look at it all.

As a past endurance athlete for 17 years (retired from that in 05) my lipids were sliding towards the not so good ranges and I was slightly hypo on a T4 med during those last 8 years. Lack of exercise or diet was not the problem. Hashimoto contributed to ending my competitive days in several ways, mostly body pain and diminishing energy. Thats also a good excuse to just spectate now, plus I'm not getting any younger LOLI still tried to remain in good physical condition but not like in the past, never gained weight but lipids continued to slide in the wrong direction. Until last summer, after one year on ERFA T3/T4 that is. A huge improvement on all lipid panel tests despite less exercise. My FT3 is around 1/3 into the range, fasting AM blood draw. Heart palps present on T4 med only, went away with the addition of T3 supplementation from ERFA.I dont think its a coincidence.Someone from my past had unhealthy lipids, had several strokes and then after was discovered to be hypothyroid.

Meta-analyses of various controlled studies in which thyroxine therapy has been (in some patients) excessive are difficult to interpret because of the heterogeneity of patients studied.12,13 One meta-analysis suggests that postmenopausal women with serum TSH concentration suppressed to below the reference range have a higher annual bone loss than healthy individuals not given thyroxine12; another suggests that thyroxine therapy, even when adjusted to give a TSH value within the range, is associated with bone loss in premenopausal women.13 However, a study of 1180 women (largely postmenopausal) on thyroxine for over 1 year found no increased rate of fracture when serum TSH concentration was suppressed to below 0.05 mU/L compared with those with a serum TSH concentration in the range0.05-4 mU/L.14It is likely that patients most at risk of developing osteoporosis from thyroxine therapy are those whose hypothyroidism has resulted from treatment of hyperthyroidism that might already have reduced bone mass. This view is supported by the results of a case-control study involving 148 women that examined the effect of previous thyroid history and thyroxine therapy on bone mineral density: thyroxine therapy alone did not represent a significant risk factor for loss of bone mineral density, but there was an increased risk of bone lost in postmenopausal (but not premenopausal) women with a previous history of thyrotoxicosis treated with radioiodine.15 The risk of osteoporosis from thyroid replacement therapy has probably been overestimated.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8...?dopt=AbstractOur study suggests that slightly suppressive L-thyroxine administration in nontoxic goitre can activate bone turnover but constitutes neither an actual risk factor for bone loss nor, consequently, for osteoporotic fractures.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8...?dopt=AbstractT4-suppressive therapy was associated with bone loss in postmenopausal women, which could be prevented by either calcium supplementation or intranasal calcitonin, although the latter did not provide additional benefit compared to calcium alone. However, careful titration of T4 dosage to maintain biochemical euthyroidism is a better way to avoid the adverse effect of T4 on bone.http://hormones.gr/preview.php?c_id=171In conclusion, the etiology of subclinical hyperthyroidism possibly affects BMD in postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women with endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism have significantly lower BMD, mainly at the distal and proximal cortical bone,versus healthy postmenopausal women. Therefore, endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism (both of autoimmune and non autoimmune etiology) might be considered as an additional risk factor for oseoporosis in postmenopausal women. On the other hand, exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism has no effect on BMD. Postmenopausal women with subclinical hyperthyroidism have a higher bone turnover rate in comparison with the control group, though they do not differ in biochemical parameters of calcium and phosphorous metabolism.http://www.ccjm.org/content/77/11/803.fullhttp://hormones.gr/preview.php?c_id=144The management of exogenous SubHyper relies on appropriate adjustment of T4 dosage taking into consideration a) individual requirements in T4, sex, age and the presence of cardiovascular disease or other co-morbidity, b) the recognition that small changes in serum FT4 have a logarithmic effect on TSH, c) the variability of FT4-TSH interactions between individuals, d) the instability of T4 preparations and its bioavailability, and e) the values of serum FT4 and FT3 that accompany a suppressed TSH. This last parameter is of importance since it is the free thyroid hormones values in the serum that generate and reflect the thyroid metabolic state of the organism rather than the degree of TSH suppression.http://hormones.gr/preview.php?c_id=171The etiology of subclinical hyperthyroidism influences B MD in postmenopausal women. Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism might be considered as an additional risk factor for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, especially for cortical bone, whereas exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism has no effect on BMD.Therefore, it is likely that not only low TSH level but also the etiology of subclinical hyperthyroidism affect BMD.exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism has no effect on BMD.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17324919Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism might be considered as an additional risk factor for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, especially for cortical bone, whereas exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism has no effect on BMD.http://endocrinetoday.com/view.aspx?rid=62295\u201cOur findings confirm that it may be safe for patients with hypothyroidism to take marginally higher doses of thyroxine than our currently recommended,\u201d Leese said in the release.http://www.endocrine-abstracts.org/e...a0021oc5.6.htmSociety for Endocrinology BES 2010Manchester, UK15 March 2010 - 18 March 2010Society for EndocrinologyBritish Endocrine Societieshttp://www.imt.ie/news/uncategorized/2010/03/thyroxine-safe-with-low-tsh-levels.htmlAnd finally on google booksRunning on empty: hypothyroidism, introduction to an underactive thyroid glandBy Robyn KoumourouThis was an interesting back and forth with therapist about depressionhttp://www.dr-bob.org/tips/split/Thyroid-replacement.html",

    "question": "I have been reading that there is a correlation between LDL, Cholesterol and FT3 in particular. Yhat raising the FT3 level will improve LDL and cholesterol. With LDL it has to do with reducing receptor sites. Has anyone here seen an improvement in their lipid panels as the FT3 got in the upper normal range?",
