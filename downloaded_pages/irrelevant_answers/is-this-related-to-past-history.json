    "question": "In 1987 I was dx with a carcinoid tumor of the appendix that had penetrated the wall and cancer cells had moved into the colon.In 2004 I began to have neurological sx that began as tripping and falling, fatigue, muscle spasms, footdrop, dropping things, pins and needles in feet hands and face.I was originally dx w/ CIDP based on abnormal EVP's, negative MRI and LP.In 2006 an lesion appeared on my MRI (cervical) and dx changed to possible MS.However, I have gained no additional MS criteria and my condition continues to deteriorate (thus, TM dx is unlikely)Is it possible to have a recurrence of the carcinoid after all this time?\u00a0\u00a0Does it ever appear in the spinal cord?Are there any other diseases that present w/lesion in the spine?Thanks",
