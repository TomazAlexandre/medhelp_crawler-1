            "answer": "Dear jan,In response to your questions.1. Is there a difference between an echo and a 2 d echo? No this is just a difference in terminology.\u00a0\u00a0To be correct there is an M mode echo ( 1 dimensional), 2-D and 3D echos.\u00a0\u00a0For clinical purposes we use a combination of M mode and 2d.2. What would be structural that wouldcause syncope?\u00a0\u00a0Almost any valve disease or a decrease in heart function may cause this.3. The tech pointed out TR, that's Tricuspid regurg., isn't it? Yes that is a leak of blood from the right ventricle to the right atrium through the TV.\u00a0\u00a0mild TR is very common.4. He measured the T Wave (8) andthe A Wave (6). What are they and what is the significance of the measurements? These are measures of right sided pressure and are essentially normal.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your answer.\u00a0\u00a0Would you mind answering a few more questions? If both valves are of mild regurg. (which I actually don't know, yet) could that cause syncope?\u00a0\u00a0Also, if they are mild, along with IST and neurocardiogenic syncope (yes, another syncope), my heart is still considered healthy, isn't it. Lastly, but along the same lines, is any of this considered heart disease?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, again.",
