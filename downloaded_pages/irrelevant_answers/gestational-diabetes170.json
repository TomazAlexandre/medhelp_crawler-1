At 34 weeks I have to see my doctor 2 times a week while they do a non stress test on the baby. I didn't bomb my 3 hour test. 2 of my draws were low and 2 were slightly elevated.",

            "answer": "I have gestational diabetes and was put on a diet and also insulin. Doctor didn't want me taking pills to control it. I check my levels 4 times a day and take insulin 4 times a day. They are small dosage but it helps the baby maintain her levels. She is measuring slightly bigger than her age. Best part is I see her often with ultrasounds. All in all nothing to be afraid about. We as mothers will do what we have to do to take care of our bodies for our unborn. Hope this helps.",
