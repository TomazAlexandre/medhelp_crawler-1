            "answer": "Perhaps you should see a competent endocrinoligist - which is not your current doctor, and take in copies of your current testing, and get more testing, and find out what is really going on.It may be that you have more health issues going on.As well, consuming too few calories is also detrimental - the body will not lose when it is starving so make sure you are dieting well. I would eat more small meals then two meals as that would raise your blood sugar and be very bad for\u00a0\u00a0your diabetes - you need to eat for that. So eat more often, eating less. Going without meals with make the diabetes worse.Central weight gain is often cortisol - any testing on that?",

            "answer": "Hi again!Just a little abt cortisol.\u00a0\u00a0It's a hormone released by your adrenal glands when under stress.\u00a0\u00a0Stress can be anything from doing too much, having all sorts of problems, and health issues. I was hypothyroid for abt 30 years; then I needed back surgery...I had 4 surgeries over 5 years.\u00a0\u00a0That put a lot of stress on my body, I slowly depleted my cortisol, and weight piled on with vengence.\u00a0\u00a0I became increasingly fatigued, hardly ate a thing [I was too exhausted to eat] but the weight just kept rising.\u00a0\u00a0Last year, May 30, my husband passed away and added more stress.\u00a0\u00a0I was disabled from the surgeries, constantly fatigued,\u00a0\u00a0and gained even more weight.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, in Jan I told my doc \"Something HAS to be wrong...I can't go on living like this\".\u00a0\u00a0She thought a minute, and said \"I don't know....I wonder if we should check your cortisol\".\u00a0\u00a0Not knowing what cortisol is, I still jumped in, \"YES!\"...my thought being....try something different, all the other tests came back 'normal'.\u00a0\u00a0I was tested 2 weeks later.\u00a0\u00a0They found I was WAY low...almost non-existant.I returned to her, and she put me on hydrocortisone, a hormone that replaces what the adrenal gland doesn't.\u00a0\u00a0Within 3 days I noticed I was energetic, and could walk better.\u00a0\u00a0She had me on a high dose to 'jump start' my adrenals.\u00a0\u00a0Three weeks later, and one more visit to her, she cut me back...I still did well.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing my endo did was to change my thyroid dose to 112mcg [which for me is quite minimal]\u00a0\u00a0According to the thyro test I was running 'hyper'. Well, I have no symptoms of hyperthyroidism, except the weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0I'm to be checked next week, and see the endo on the 29th.\u00a0\u00a0If she wants to lower my dosage, I am going to refuse.\u00a0\u00a0It's my belief that doctors shouldn't go according to what's 'normal'.\u00a0\u00a0They should include the symptoms...if a person is within 'normal' range, but feeling fatigued and maintaining/gaining a large amt of weight, that should be factored in, and the dosage should be raised.\u00a0\u00a0Docs seem to just go by what the books say, and don't listen to the patients.\u00a0\u00a0In my case, they were giving me all kinds of meds to 'change the symptoms'.\u00a0\u00a0That didn't work; all that happened was I had a lot of drugs inside me, and a thinner wallet.\u00a0\u00a0I'm now off 5 of the medications, and only taking Synthoid [she wouldn't allow me to take levothyroxine as I did for over 40 years]\u00a0\u00a0and Hydrocortisone, 5mg...10mg in the morning, 5mg in the afternoon, no later than 4.\u00a0\u00a0[too much cortisol can keep a person from sleeping]Well, that's my story and explanation.Are you under more stress than usual?\u00a0\u00a0Do you have body aches/pains?\u00a0\u00a0Many doctors say 'it's just stress'.\u00a0\u00a0Well, DUH...they don't think further to say..\"Hmmmm...maybe this person's cortisol is low\".Please let me know what happens at your visit to the endo...I'm really concerned.\u00a0\u00a0I'll also let you know what happens at MY endo appt. the 29th.My best to you.",

            "answer": "OMG... find another doctor. First of all, in all circumstances - no disease has a perfect sign and with high and low cortisol, there are so many symptoms, no one person has all of them.I used to have high cortisol, and now I have low since my adrenals were removed to cure the high cortisol - so I have lived both. The flush, BTW, is HIGH cortisol. And she is sort of describing a moon face, again a high cortisol symptom. I never got that either - it is set on charts as 20%. The only way to know is by testing - and if you are cylical, and there is lab error and high CBG and things that can stand in that way as for making those tests look a bit wonky. An endo should not treat on how you look - it can be so deceptive!As for the T3, take the doses at different times of day - that will help the heart palps - talk to the pharmacist. It has nothing to do with coffee and everything to do with how your body uses the medicine. I have to take mine 3x a day. It should be given in 5mg tablets ideally but if\u00a0\u00a0you have a larger pill, chop it up and spread it out.",
