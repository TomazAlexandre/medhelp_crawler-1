            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Persistently elevated liver enzymes could be an indication for liver biopsy. This is planned after correlating with imaging studies, clinical symptoms and other blood tests. Elevated levels can occur with liver disease, but other causes for the enzyme elevation could be muscle disease or injury. Some medications can also raise these levels. Discuss these options with your consulting doctor.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "my test came back negative for hep A, B, C, and with the 2 numbers they look at, one of them went back down into normal range while the other is almost back to normal. The doc thinks its because of the diabetes.When I went to the ER, my blood sugar levels were in the 300's and there was sugar in my urine. I guess the test they did initially was just a cbc by both the hospital and doc, then the doc ran a second cbc and liver panel.",

    "question": "2 or 3 months ago I went to the ER for severe and constant itch in the vaginal area. He tested for everything and in the end I was told I had type 2 diabetes and my liver enzymes were a little elevated and suggested the elevated enzymes were most likely from the diabetes.A few weeks later my doc repeated the test and again my liver enzymes came back a little high, he also believes its from the diabetes and suggested we do another set of test including a complete liver panel and hep c just to see whats going on for sure.Now im freaking out. I went for the blood work this morning and while I've put the test out of my mind for the last few weeks, its weighing on me, mostly because of the hep c.I've read the list of symptoms and we all know the net is never really accurate. I dont have '' high risk factors'' so maybe im being paranoid, but I cant help it.The symptoms I'm seeing is jaundice, pain near the liver area, elevated liver counts.I have tattoos, lots of them, but they were all done professionally. Im not a drug user and I've always made sure any needles used on me are opened in front of me. I've seen that it is 'rare' to contract it through sexual activity and Ive always used protection except for with my ex husband and my current Bf of 3 yrs.Im not jaundiced, in pain, exhausted, or anything else Ive read with the exception of my stool being a dark yellowish color.Any insight would be appreciated",
