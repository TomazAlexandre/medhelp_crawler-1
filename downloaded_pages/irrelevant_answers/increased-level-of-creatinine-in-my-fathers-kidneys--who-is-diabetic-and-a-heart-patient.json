            "answer": "Abnormal Creatinine levels after first mild heart attack may indicate persistent renal insufficiency or hypoperfusion where the presenting symptoms are not seen or may be preferred diagnostic criteria.More over as you stated that your father is diabetic, the glucose levels are very important to be considered in this case.In patients with diabetic ketoacidosis and fever if antibiotics are indicated, they raise Ck levels by 2 folds which may be an explanation.If the doctors still say that your\u00a0\u00a0fathers condition is still critical, it does mean to say that his BP and DM is still not under sustained control to let him be discharged.Its better to let him stay in the hospital for some more days till his condition is fully under control.Regarding the treatment options,I could not really direct you as there is a limitation of History of illness and complete explanation about his situation.So catch me up in personal messages.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the reply and valuable suggestion. Sorry i was replying late as the circumstances were not too easy. However the good news is that the creatinine is under control and its has decreased from 5.5 to 4.2 in 36 hours. But, the EF is down to 20 now so that is a big concern. Doctors are saying that cretanine will eventually flow out with urine, just follow the prescribed medication. Will post reports and other data in time.Thanks for the reply.",

    "question": "Hi,My father creatanine levels are increasing rapidly since last three days and are now at 5.3 whereas normal rate is 0.5 to 1.5. He suffered a severe heart attack about 14 years ago and underwent a successful surgery to overcome that. That point his EF was 35 which now has become 25. He is diabetic as well. Recently he was showing a lot of signs of weakness after he became ill due to a sudden weather change. He was taking his medicine as prescribed by doctor for the fever. About 3 days back he suddenly became unconscious and was rushed to the nearest hospital. His diabetes was not in control and blood pressure was very low 40\\70. After doing tests it was found that his creatanine levels were abnormal. At present he is at a hospital in high dependency unit, his blood pressure is still 60/100 and diabetes is also in control. He is having no trouble with urination right now. Doctors are saying he is still in critical condition.I would like to know about the treatments available for him in this situation as dialysis is a risky option for my father. Any help would be greatly appreciated, we are really confused and in a lot of stress, writing it out as we await to see my father during visiting hours. Hoping for the best.",
