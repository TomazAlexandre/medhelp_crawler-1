    "question": "All right all you ladies in the National Worry Warts Association - here's a little moral story for ya'll - about the dangers of worrying and freaking out.Once upon a time, there was a crazy lady who lived in Reno.\u00a0\u00a0She started out her pregnancy with a little more cushion for the pushin and so was trying to not gain too much weight too fast, so she weighed herself twice a week - just to watch of course.\u00a0\u00a0One morning, she went into the bathroom to weigh herself, after her morning pee and before breakfast, same as always.\u00a0\u00a0Horror of horrors, upon trying to look down at the scale of the huge boobies the booby fairy was kind enough to send, she could see that she had LOST ten pounds since Monday!\u00a0\u00a0Gasp - imagine the fear and fright.\u00a0\u00a0She immediately ran to her ever growing stack of books, searching through them all for information with no luck.\u00a0\u00a0She grabbed her trusty laptop and searched the internet - only scaring herself more upon finding out that weight loss in pregnancy can be an indicator of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0She grabbed her phone, ready to call her ob/gyn and demand that she be checked because obviously she had lost the baby, all the weight, etc overnight and missed it somehow.\u00a0\u00a0Before she could dial though, the wonderful urge to pee hit her and she ran to the bathroom.\u00a0\u00a0While peeing - she glanced down at the dial on the scale.\u00a0\u00a0\"Hmmmmm - said she.\u00a0\u00a0That might have a more accurate reading if the red line started out on the 0 instead of seven numbers below 0!\"\u00a0\u00a0So peace and tranquility reigned supreme once more in the little kingdom of crazydom.The moral to this fractured fairytale - when your day has gone bad and you are kinda feeling wacked out - just remember - there is SOMEONE in this world who is crazier then you!\u00a0\u00a0LOL - Happy Friday ladies!!",
