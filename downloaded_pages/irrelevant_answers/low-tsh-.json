            "answer": "The TSH is slightly low with normal T4 and completely normal T3 -- with normal prolactin and the presence of menstruation, all this means it's not likely central hypothyroid (ie, the pituitary appears fine).The slightly low TSH is nonspecific (but points towards mild/subclinical hyperthyroidism) and needs to be watched but would not likely cause heavy menses.\u00a0\u00a0Would complete the thyroid evaluation with ultrasound and possibly anti-thyroid antibodies.",

            "answer": "So just for clarification...You would still lean toward sub-hyper even though my fT4 is in the bottom 1/4% of normal with a low TSH? It seems my symptoms are more hypo than hyper. In fact I don't think I have a single symptom of hyper. I had a Mild brain injury to the back of my head a few years ago and have read that might cause hypopituitary.I also forgot to mention that I never produced enough breast milk. Could that point to something?Perhaps I'm way off, but I've read that low TSH and low-normal fT4 points to central hypo. AmI barking up the wrong tree here. I'd hate to push for pituitary+hypothalamus tests if it doesn't make sense. Thanks Doc!",

    "question": "HI,I've been having severely heavy periods (soak thru a Super tampon AND nightime pad in the night) every since I got my cycles post breastfeeding.\u00a0\u00a0My doc says some people just get heavy periods and that my fatigue and foggy brain is because I have young kids. Sounds like there is more to it than that. what do you think?TSH: in Jan was .26\u00a0\u00a0 2 weeks ago .24\u00a0\u00a0and now .16 (.35 - 4.94)Free T4: 2 weeks ago .74 and now .96 (.71 - 1.85)Free T3: 3.3 (2.3 - 4.2)T3 Uptake: 31% (23-37)Prolactin: 4.3 (2.8 - 29.2) these were drawn the 1st day of my cycle (range is follicular phase?)FSH: 6.8 (2.5 - 10.2) these we drawn the 1st day of my cycle (range is follicular phase?)LH: 2.4 (1.9 - 12.5) these we drawn the 1st day of my cycle (range is follicular phase?)Bilirubin 1.1 (.3 - 1.2)From what I've read it seems that my T4 should be in the upper 1/3 if my TSH is so low...meaning hypothyroid. So does this point to Central Hypopituitary? or could it be andrenal?These are my symptoms:-cold easily- dull aching kidney pain (flank pain?)- aching joints especially hips and hands- weight fluctuation- intermitant hairlossGYNO:-very heavy painful menstruation since stopping breast feeding 1.3 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0however now they seem to be stopping midway and then restarting again a day or two later (last 3 cycles). accompanied with diarrheaPSYCHOLOGICAL:- irritability and mood swings- significant memory loss and poor consentration (decrease in executive functioning)FATIGUE- have to take a nap mid afternoonSKIN- severely oily skin which has now developed Sebasceous Hyperplasia all over my face neck and other places- hyperpigmentation spots developing on face (not melasma but have that too from pregnancy)- tiny white spots all over legs and armsHISTORY:I have a Hx of gestational diabetes even though I'm very fitA concussion to the back of my head 7 years ago that caused temporary tunnel vision and amnesiaHad C-Section's 2006 and 2008I'm 37 and female.",
