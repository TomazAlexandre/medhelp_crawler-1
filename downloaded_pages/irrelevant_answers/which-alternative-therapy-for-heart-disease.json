            "answer": "Slash Heart Disease Risk by 81 PercentFor millions or people, statin drugs are the number one doctor-prescribed defense against heart disease. In fact, so many people take them that we spent $12.5 billion on Lipitor in 2006 alone. But brand new research reveals that they may seriously damage your health. That\u2019s because statins significantly increase your risk of diabetes.That means millions of people taking the drugs now have to decide which is worse\u2026 heart disease or diabetes.An epic study shows that specific dietary changes can reduce your risk of heart disease by 81 percent \u2013 without resorting to statin drugs. And leading doctors agree that combatting heart disease through diet isn\u2019t just safer\u2026 it\u2019s far more effective too.Dangers of Statin DrugsPlenty of reports say statin drugs cause severe pain and can actually make muscles atrophy. Worse, they may actually increase your risk of stroke.Now, a brand new study, published in The Lancet, confirms that statins do cause diabetes. Researchers reviewed the case files of over 91,000 people from 1994 through 2009. They found a direct link between people taking statins and developing diabetes.Why use a [drug] with significant risks when other treatments [are] more effective for reducing heart disease? asks Dr. Mark Hyman, a Massachusetts physician who serves on the Board of Advisors at Georgetown University. He says he\u2019s helped hundreds of patients combat heart disease without using statin drugs.Another study \u2013 put out several years earlier by the American Medical Association \u2013 also found that statins increase diabetes risk. The paper showed that while statins lowered cholesterol, they raised insulin levels. And that\u2019s a precursor for diabetes.What\u2019s worse, raised insulin leads to extra body fat\u2026 higher blood pressure\u2026 and increased inflammation. All of which contribute to heart disease.\u201cIn other words, lowering cholesterol with statins actually increases the risk of heart disease,\u201d says Dr. Hyman.But statin drugs are huge business. They generate over $12.5 billion in sales each year for Lipitor alone. And many doctors are pushed to prescribe them.These drugs are the conventional response to high cholesterol. So drug companies have worked to make sure more people take them.\u201cWhen I was at medical school, the \u2018normal\u2019 cholesterol was 250,\u201d says Dr. Carolyn Dean, MD. \u201cThe new \u2018normal\u2019 promoted by drug companies is 180. Hammering cholesterol down with statin drugs is the wrong approach.\u201dCauses of Heart DiseaseThe Archives of Internal Medicine has just published the results if its \u201cEPIC\u201d study. Researchers took 23,000 people and studied their risk factors for heart disease. They found that changes in diet reduced heart attack risk by 81 percent.How could such simple changes deliver such amazing results? By lowering blood pressure and reducing inflammation.This comes as no surprise to NHD panel member Dr. Dwight Lundell. He was a heart surgeon for 25 years and performed over 5,000 open-heart surgeries. During his career he\u2019s pioneered several innovative advances in coronary medicine.He says four things cause inflammation and lead to heart disease.1) Simple carbs and grains are the single biggest threat to heart health. They raise blood sugar which releases insulin into your system. Insulin stores and builds fat \u2013 especially around the waist.\u201cEvery time we raise our blood sugar we injure the delicate lining of our blood vessels,\u201d says Dr. Lundell.And that leads to inflammation and heart disease.2) Vegetable oils are deadly for our coronary system. They contain an unhealthy amount of omega 6 fatty acids.Our bodies change these fatty acids into chemicals that cause chronic inflammation.\u201cWe do need omega 6,\u201d says Dr. Lundell. \u201cBut we\u2019re getting 20-25 times more in our diets.\u201d3) Deficiency in omega 3 fatty acids hurts heart health.\u201cOmega 3 is a powerful natural anti-inflammatory,\u201d he says.There\u2019s plenty of research which shows omega 3 boosts heart health. Those studies say it\u2019s your best option for cooling inflammation.4) Oxidative stress damages your heart. Free radical damage causes inflammation and increases stroke risk.\u201cOxidative stress is detrimental to health and is definitely [linked] with heart disease,\u201d says Dr. Lundell.The good news is that all of these heart risks are easy to fix without statin drugs. Small, simple changes in diet can improve heart health.Boost Heart Health through DietYou can take a few key steps to improve your diet and heart health. In a nutshell, you need to eat more omega 3s and cut back on omega 6s. Slash your carbs and go for healthy fats and protein. And look to boost your intake of antioxidants.Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to what you need to do:Make omega 3 fatty acids part of your daily diet. So much scientific evidence shows that omega 3s are vital to heart health. And there are plenty of good sources to choose from. There\u2019s no good reason not to enjoy omega 3s.Your best sources for these fatty acids include:Sardines, Tuna, Wild salmon, Grass-fed beef,\u00a0\u00a0Milk, Cage-free eggs,Be sure when choosing fish that you avoid the farm-raised variety. It\u2019s better to go for cold-water wild fish. That\u2019s because they have a proper ratio of omega 3 to omega 6.Dr. Lundell says you need to eat at least two to three servings of fresh fish each week.Another easy option for getting omega 3 into your diet is a simple fish oil supplement.\u201cSupplement your diet with at least 3 grams of high quality pure fish oil,\u201d says Dr. Lundell.Cut out omega 6 from your diet. Too much of this fatty acid will do serious harm. So try to keep your omega 3s high and your omega 6s low. It\u2019s pretty easy to do with a little effort and well worth it. Just make sure you avoid the worst foods. These include:Grain-fed beef, Grain-fed chicken,\u00a0\u00a0Processed foods, Fried foods, Vegetable oilsTry to get more saturated fats into your diet. These can really help to reduce inflammation.Great sources include:Olive oil,\u00a0\u00a0Walnuts, pecans, and almonds,\u00a0\u00a0AvocadosSlash sugary and starchy carbs from your diet. These are the worst offenders for raising blood sugar and insulin. That process wreaks havoc on long-term heart health. Worst offenders include:Bread, Pasta, RiceLook to enrich your diet with antioxidants.There are so many to choose from. Even foods like dark chocolate and red wine are loaded with them. Some of the best antioxidants include:Berries,\u00a0\u00a0Broccoli, Grapes,\u00a0\u00a0SpinachYou can easily combine all of these suggestions into simple meal plans. For breakfast, switch out bagels and cheerios for yogurt, hard boiled eggs, and a handful or almonds.When you\u2019re on the run, try combining your healthy snack foods to enjoy vital omega 3s and antioxidants in one go. A grab-bag of walnuts, blueberries, and grapes packs a powerful punch. A don\u2019t forget to wash it down with some antioxidant-rich green tea.You can\u2019t beat broccoli and grass-fed beef for dinner\u2026 or spinach and wild salmon\u2026 for a powerful combination of health benefits. And you can help yourself to a glass of red wine (loaded with youth-preserving resveratrol) and a square or two of dark chocolate.",

            "answer": "Iron and Heart DiseaseThere is compelling evidence that excess iron is playing a major role in a number of diseases, including cardiovascular disease.The first strong suggestion that iron was linked to the risk of cardiovascular disease came from the studies of Dr. J. L. Sullivan, who noticed that premenopausal women had a much lower heart attack risk than men in the same age group, and that with the onset of menopause, women\u2019s risk rose rapidly.At first, it was assumed that estrogen was playing a protective role. But more careful studies demonstrated that premenopausal women had much lower iron levels than postmenopausal women, primarily due to blood loss during menstruation. Experiments using animals seemed to confirm Sullivan\u2019s hypothesis. Animals fed or infused with excessive iron developed dramatic increases in atherosclerosis.Consider heart attacks and strokes. Most of them do not result simply from plaque buildup and blockage in an artery. Rather, most heart attacks and strokes are caused by the sudden appearance of a blood clot at the site of an unstable plaque. When all this inflammation is occurring within a blood vessel, the body tries to contain the problem by various means including:Cooling down the inflammation, Encasing the inflammation in a wall of tough collagen,Boosting antioxidant defensesIf successful, blockage of the vessel is unlikely. But in many cases, the inflammation only worsens, and eventually the collagen cap over the inflammation weakens and ruptures, spilling toxic pus out into the blood vessel.This pus triggers a blood clot to form in an effort to keep the inflammation from spreading further. Unfortunately, it also shuts off the blood supply in the blood vessel.Of critical importance to containing this toxic pus is the strength of the collagen cap over the plaque. One of the major causes of weakening of the plaque cap is release of an enzyme called MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase-9). This enzyme dissolves the cap, making a rupture more likely. Excess iron seems to promote MMP-9 activation.A number of nutritional compounds can significantly strengthen the cap, including:Grape seed extract (anthrocyanadins), Curcumin, Quercetin, Ellagic acid,Hesperidin, Luteolin, Vitamin C, Zinc.These also are powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatories, which help cool the reactions within the wall of the blood vessel. Not only are these natural substances more effective by far than statin drugs, they are much safer.While the evidence is not strong enough to say iron overloading is the cause of cardiovascular disease, it is playing a major role in driving the process that is at the root of some of these heart disorders. Research suggests that lowering iron levels may prevent or slow the progression of such conditions.",
