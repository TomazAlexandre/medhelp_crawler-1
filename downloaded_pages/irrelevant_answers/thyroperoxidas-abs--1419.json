            "answer": "christine01,I think this is the antibody test for Hashimoto's. I skimmed through a few posts here and only found others in the 300-600 range, so I thought maybe 1419 was way out of range. But I feel better if it's typical to be so high.Thanks for your reply.",

            "answer": "Tpub,I just posted a heading \"MKD1, Very Valuable Imput You Gave\", that you might want to read.Your Abs, were high! I think though that higher does not necessarily mean more severe disease but could mean the ABs are killing off your thyroid faster. Some people claim a Hashi's patient is better off once the gland totally atrophies (dies out) because it is easier to adjust the medication dose and keep it maintained. I don't know if this is true or not but sounds like it very well could be!I've seen testimonies of people who had over 2,000 on their TPO. Some people have very high TPO and negative for the TG (thyroglobulin Abs) and some are the other way around. Then again, some people have almost equal amounts of both.Dr.s are yet to find the reason for A.I. diseases but I know they are trying and there are great Dr.s out there!",

            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for your replies.Yes, I had an ultrasound last week. My mother had her thyroid moved when she was about my age. They thought she might have thyroid cancer. When my endo heard about that he wanted to rule it out for me. Haven't heard the results yet.As for symptoms, I really don't know. I get really tired sometimes and I cannot stay awake on a car trip (unless I'm the driver). But I can attribute that to blood sugar issues and the fact that I keep my carbs down to about 120g/day and run 2-5 miles a day. I don't have any hair loss problems. Not sure what the other symptoms of Hashi's are...I have been on the WebMD thryoid message boards and someone there posted their TPO number was over 24,000, so now I don't feel so bad.Thanks again and good luck to all!",

    "question": "Hi, I'm new here. I've been on Synthroid for hypothyroidism for about 9 months, but last week was told I definitely have Hashimoto's Disease because the above-mentioned test was way out of range.I don't know much about hypothyroidism or Hashimoto's yet. I was diagnosed a\u00a0\u00a0year ago with diabetes and have spent most of my time researching that.I've glanced through the posts here and see that most people who mention this test don't have numbers anywhere near this high. Does 1419 seem outrageously high? What exactly does it mean?If it helps, I'm on 100 mcg of Synthroid and the TSH at this same blood test was 2.7. I don't know if I have any symptoms of Hashimoto's because I tend to attribute a lot of \"aches and pains\" to getting older or the diabetes.Thanks in advance.",
