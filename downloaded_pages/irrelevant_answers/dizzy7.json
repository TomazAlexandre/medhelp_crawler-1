            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!There are many causes of dizziness, lightheadedness, passing out, blackouts etc. It is difficult to comment without examination. I am just enumerating the possible causes. You can discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Dizziness could be due to postural hypotension (blood pressure falling with change of position), internal ear problems and cervical spondylitis or compression of cervical spinal nerves. All these cause dizziness when you get up from lying down position or when you change position that results in a change in the level of your head. Cervical spondylitis and ear problems also cause dizziness on changing the position of the neck.Other causes are anemia, claustrophobia, GERD, hypoglycemia or low sugar and some endocrine problems. Endocrine problems, such as an underactive thyroid (called hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (called hyperthyroidism), adrenal insufficiency (called Addison's disease), low blood sugar levels, and in some cases, diabetes, may lead to hypotension and hence lightheadedness and an off balance feeling.Certain types of epilepsies and seizures too can cause similar symptoms. If you have an accompanying headache then you must also look at benign intracranial hypertension. Heart problems too should be ruled out in your case. If all other tests are normal, maybe an ECHO should be done to rule out mitral valve prolapse.A comprehensive investigation is required taking all these points into consideration. The best thing would be to consult a general practitioner or PCP and try and assess what is the cause of your problem. Then proper referral for concerned specialist can take things further and get you proper treatment. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Hi !russ8140 already mentioned some possibilities with the causes of your dizziness but, I have a question...do you do some exercise like simple stretching everyday like a few minutes\u00a0\u00a0walk probably, to circulate the blood in your body? If not, you have to do so...If yes, please see a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Moreover,\u00a0\u00a0blood pressure test should first be done as well.\u00a0\u00a0It could probably be a symptom of heart disease or your blood pressure.",
