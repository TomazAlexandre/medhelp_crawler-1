            "answer": "Hello,I agree with your cardiologist that lifestyle and medicines are needed for moderate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. It can also be termed as the early stage of diastolic dysfunction. No specific treatment is needed and lifestyle measures need to be incorporated. The diastolic dysfunction treatment is generally aimed at treating a cause like diabetes, high blood pressure, etc. that leads to a stiff ventricleCalcium channel blocker drugs may be used to reduce the stiffness in ventricles.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
