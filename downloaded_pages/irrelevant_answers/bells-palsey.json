            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Unfortunately, yes, it is possible to suffer from Bell's palsy more than once. However the recurrence rate is very small. The recurrence is more in presence of underlying disorders like diabetes, viral infections, and positive rheumatic serology test. It is difficult to predict whether it will recur or not. You must run blood tests to rule out diabetes.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

However if you have a viral infection , even a viral flu like symptom, then it is found to be associated or resulting in Bell\u2019s palsy. The reason or correlation is not known.Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
