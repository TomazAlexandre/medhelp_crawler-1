            "answer": "By misbeats I'll assume you mean palpitations. Your doctor should check to make sure it's nothing serious. It's for your doctor to decide on what tests to do but I think he would probably do an ECG. Because you willmmost likely nt have mis beats when you're at the doctors he may also wish to do a 24 ECG to try and catch your symptoms when they happen. My doctor seems un concerned with my palpitations, I think provided there is no underlying problem palpitations can often be things we just have to learn to live with.",
