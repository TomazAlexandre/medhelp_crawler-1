            "answer": "I'm sorry you haven't been feeling well and are going through such a rough time.\u00a0\u00a0While I understand why you don't want to talk to your parents or go to a counselor, you really, really need to.\u00a0\u00a0Not just for your emotional health, but for your physical health also.\u00a0\u00a0If you really feel that you can't talk to your parents - or are afraid to do so - find another trusted adult - a teacher, a counselor at school, the school nurse, the principal - anybody that you trust.\u00a0\u00a0If you're having trouble opening up and being able to talk about things, simply show them your arm where you've been cutting and that will help \"break the ice\".\u00a0\u00a0You can also call, toll free and completely anonymously, the suicide prevention hotline - you can find their number online or in your yellow pages phone book.\u00a0\u00a0You may feel more comfortable talking to someone over the phone like that rather than in person, so that may be a way to take that first step to getting some help.some of your physical symptoms could indicate diabetes, but they could also indicate an electrolyte imbalance from drinking TOO much water.\u00a0\u00a0I know it sounds crazy, but you really CAN drink too much water and cause problems with your electrolytes (sodium, potassium, other minerals) getting too low in your blood.\u00a0\u00a0My nephew had this happen to him when he was in Marine boot camp and believe me, if this is what's going on physically, you don't want it to continue.\u00a0\u00a0It could end up causing permanent problems with your heart, brain, seizures, etc.Believe me, please, that I'm not trying to scare you - I simply want you to know that it is very important that you find SOMEONE who you can talk to and get both your physical and emotional troubles checked into.When you say you \"pass out\" - do you mean you just suddenly fall asleep without remembering falling asleep?\u00a0\u00a0Or do you literally pass out where you lose consciousness and end up on the floor?\u00a0\u00a0It's actually very common for teens your age to have a different sleep schedule and stay up til the wee hours of the morning and then sleep later - however, changes in sleep patterns can also be a symptom of both physical and emotional troubles, so getting this looked into also is important.NEVER be embarrassed or feel badly about writing poetry.\u00a0\u00a0Some of the most beautiful poems, songs, love letters were written by men!\u00a0\u00a0It most definitely does NOT mean that you are gay.\u00a0\u00a0Try not to pay any attention to what others say - I know that is a lot easier said than done.I know I'm a lot older than you are and I may sound like just anotehr adult preaching to you, but honestly I'm not.\u00a0\u00a0I really am worried about you and hope that you'll take my advice and reach out to someone and get the help that you need - and DESERVE!!Please let me know how you're doing and KEEP ON WRITING!",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Constant thirst, dry mouth etc can be due to anxiety, acid reflux and or diabetes. Since you are facing a lot of psychological issues, it is but natural to be anxious. This can also cause neck and chest pain. However, in your age, this pain could also be due to wrong posture while studying, working with computers, laptops etc.Since you had a sexual relationship only a day before, and have been having these symptoms for long, they are unlikely to be STD related.Please discuss with your parents or a school teacher or someone older who understands you and seek medical help.Take care!",
