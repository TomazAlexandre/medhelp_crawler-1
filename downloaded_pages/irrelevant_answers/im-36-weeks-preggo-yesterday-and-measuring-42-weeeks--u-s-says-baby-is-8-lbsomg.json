            "answer": "U/S are usually off - they induced my sister 2 weeks early because 2 weeks prior to induction baby was measuring 7 1/2 pounds on u/s - 4 weeks later, when he was born he was 6 pounds 13 ounces.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don't stress b/c of u/s weights - they are often wrong and tend to over estimate baby's weight.",

            "answer": "US can be so variable based on the measurements. You click this dot it says one thing, that dot another.I had an ultrasound at 37 weeks when I was pregnant with my son (who is now 9). It showed my son to be 10 lbs already! I went through the whole amniocentesis procedure to see if his lungs were mature so we could induce early - THEY WEREN\"T!So I waited another week till 38 weeks and my doctor *really* pressured me to have a c-section (I refused). Well my son was an easy birth and was 8 lbs 12 oz.They can definitely be wrong - hang in there.",

            "answer": "I've been there... my first pregnancy I had a vaginal delivery & my daughter weighed 9 lbs 7 oz! The doctors had estimated her at 7 lbs & had even given me an ultrasound 2 days before her birth. I couldn't believe they didn't give me a c-section w/ her. I had complications from having such a big baby! Now I'm 36 weeks pregnant and am seeing a new OB doctor. Fortunately, he seems to be keeping a closer eye on the baby's size this time around. I go for an ultrasound Nov. 3 to check her weight & size. The doctor said she hasn't come down into my pelvic area far enough at this point either.... he said after the ultrasound we'd go from there & talk about a labor plan for me. She is already measuring about 7 1/2 lbs. Ultrasounds aren't always accurate though. My cousin recently had a baby and was told he would weigh 8 1/2 lbs. He only weighed 6 lbs 9 oz. when he was born. She looked huge while pregnant... I thought for sure he was a 9 pounder. I guess no one really knows until they get!",
