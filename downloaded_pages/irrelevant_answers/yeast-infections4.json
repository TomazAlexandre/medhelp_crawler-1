            "answer": "Have you been checked for diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0This is often a cause of repeated yeast infections.Are you checked by the doctor to be CERTAIN these are yeast infections, every time? Simple white dischage without the intense itching and redness might not be yeast. Isn't necessarily an STD--there are other kinds of vaginal infections that aren't STD's.\u00a0\u00a0Some women always have a whitish discharge that is totally normal and harmful to try to get rid of.Wear loose cotton panties and change often.\u00a0\u00a0Don't douche regularly unless advised to do so by your doctor, but sometimes a gentle commercially prepared vinegar and water douche can restore the natural ph your vagina needs.\u00a0\u00a0Don't do it often, though.If you notice you always get a yeast infection after receiving oral sex (the human mouth is teeming with yeast organisms), wash with a MILD soap right afterwards, rinse very very well, and air dry.\u00a0\u00a0You could also rinse your outer parts with a mild vinegar/water mix.Don't use powders or feminine sprays.\u00a0\u00a0Don't use pantiliners--they can trap moisture next to your body-it is better to change panties often than to use pantiliners.I know there must be lactobacillus capsules available in health food stores that might restore the normal flora, but I've never used them and don't know a lot about them.I hope some of these suggestions are helpful.",
