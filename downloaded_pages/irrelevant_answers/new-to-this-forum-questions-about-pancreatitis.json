            "answer": "Door, autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is an unusual form of pancreatitis that has only recently been recognized as a distinct disorder. AIP is an unusual form of chronic pancreatitis. The immune system mistakenly attacks healthy pancreas tissue, causing inflammation and hardening. Symptoms closely mimic pancreatic cancer (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma), but the disease process is different. It can be a multisystem disorder in which the disease can affect other parts of the body. So the possibility of AIP needs to be checked out.",

    "question": "WELL THIS IS ALL VERY NEW AND UNPLEASANT FOR ME. I DID NOT REALIZE HOW MANY PEOPLE THIS EFFECTS. ANY HELP WOULD BE APPRECIATED. I JUST HAD A WEEKS STAY IN THE HOSPITAL FOR PANCREATITIS. I DID EVERY TEST UNDER THE SUN, BUT THEY COULD NOT FIND A CAUSE. I DO NOT DRINK,I DO NOT HAVE GALLSTONES, AND MY TRIGLYCERIDE LEVEL IS NORMAL. I'M LOST BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN AND CAN'T HAVE TO EAT. AS OF NOW I AM ON JUST CLEAR LIQUIDS, THE DOCTOR SAID THIS WOULD GIVE MY PANCREAS A REST AND THAT MY BOWELS WILL GET BACK TO NOT BEING JUST SMELLY WATER. (SORRY SO GRAFFIC) IT'S BEEN ABOUT 2 WKS. NOW AND I STILL HAVE A WATERY BOWEL. ANY SUGGESTIONS? IT'S REALLY SCARRY AND AM CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT SOME OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE TO LIVE WITH THIS. I KNOW I CAN'T LIVE OFF BROTH AND JELLO ALONE. THANKS IN ADVANCE.",
