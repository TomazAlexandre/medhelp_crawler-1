            "answer": "Whoa Nelly.My advice is to start with square one and learn about what diabetes is and how to control,it. A book \"Idiot's Guide to Diabetes\" is out there, and although not the best book, nor the most accurate, it is understandable.To optimally control diabetes you need to have an accurate idea of the effect of food and exercise on your blood sugar levels. The hba1c by itself is totally inadequate for this purpose.You need to use your own glucose meter and to religiously take blood samples until you get a handle on glucose control. This includes a few weeks of intense testing, to include baseline levels when you awake, before and after each meal, and two hours after each meal, along with a precise calorie count and diary of your food.\u00a0\u00a0Later on you can reduce the number of blood sticks. You can't eat like a \"normal person\". Carefully prepared meals served at the same time will provide you with a guideline as to what medication protocol works best.And you need an exercise protocol.In addition, from your \"profile\":it appears you could benefit from a daily injection of Lantus, the long-acting insulin.You don't need \"advice\" on the doseage of medication. You need hard facts about how these medications affect your blood sugar levels, and you can only get this feedack by intensive self-testing. Fortunately, modern meters have computer memories that establish the time, date and glucose reading. Many diabetic centers have computers where they download this information and print it out for you. And provide advice on changes you can make in medication, diet or exercise.If you can;t do this on your own you need to find a diabetic clinic where you will come under the care of an R.N. or Physician's,Assistant who specialize in assisting diabetic patients with setting up a program to control their disease. These clinics generally have a dieticion who will also provide counseling.The R.N.'s and Physician's assistants who work in these programs are generally very good at what they do.Generally, before entering such a program you should be evaluated by an endochronologist, with a diabetic sub-specialty. Not getting \"off-the-cuff\" haphard guesses about medication based on your Hba1c.from a physician who sees you once a year.",

            "answer": "I might add that there are many complementary treatments and diets that may help, however again the essential feedback necessary is the modern glucose meter, and rigorous real-time evaluation of how your body reacts to food, exercise and medications.",
