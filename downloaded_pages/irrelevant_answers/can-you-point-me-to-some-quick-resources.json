            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0I'm glad you are doing your best to learn how to help your son manage the disease.\u00a0\u00a0I've heard many stories of separated and divorced parents who refuse to take care of their child at all.\u00a0\u00a0Some quick tips:\u00a0\u00a0good blood sugars generally range from 80-180, the target is 100-120.\u00a0\u00a0Below 80 is called hypoglycemia, more commonly called being 'low'.\u00a0\u00a0Treatment for being low is to consume carbohydrates.\u00a0\u00a0The farther below 80, the more urgent it is to get carbs in the system.\u00a0\u00a0The farther below 80, the more carbs need to be consumed.\u00a0\u00a0If the blood sugar is 75, very little in carbs need to be eaten.\u00a0\u00a0Four or five grams would likely be enough at 75, much more if he gets a lot lower.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to retest about 30 minutes later to make sure he blood sugar is back up in safe range.Above 180 is called hyperglycemia, or being 'high'.\u00a0\u00a0It takes insulin to bring down that score, and highs aren't as serious and immediate of a threat as lows.\u00a0\u00a0Lows can be dangerous if not dealt with immediately, the threat for a high is over the long term (days and weeks).\u00a0\u00a0On the insulin therapy plan your son is on doesn't allow for any extra insulin to be given until the regularly scheduled time.\u00a0\u00a0That being said, there are things you can do to lower the blood sugar level.\u00a0\u00a0Drinking water is one way, exercise is the other.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise absorbs sugars in the blood stream without the need for insulin.Carb counting is a challenge, even for people dealing with diabetes for a long time.\u00a0\u00a0Eating at home can be tougher than eating out, since depending on where you go, the restaurant will be able to give carb counts.\u00a0\u00a0At home, if you're making your own food, you have to do an educated guess.\u00a0\u00a0Read the labels, ensure you have the portion sizes right, and you'll do fine.JDRF has information online for people newly diagnosed:http://www.jdrf.org/index.cfm?page_id=103438Children with Diabetes is another wonderful organization, they have a bunch of good info on their web site:http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/dictionary/t.htm#Type1This forum is also good for getting information.\u00a0\u00a0And as hard as it might be to do, ask his mom what to do.\u00a0\u00a0She's had the training from the doctor, she's been dealing with it since diagnosis, I'm sure she wants to ensure that your son stays healthy when he's with you.\u00a0\u00a0Please ask her for help, for your son's sake.",

I am feeling better now and have some places to look when I am unsure. I want to get back to enjoying the weekend with my son rather than stressing and harping on the young fella.",

            "answer": "I was wondering if you are ever allowed to go to his endocronologist visit. That might help you as well.\u00a0\u00a0Does he have a dietition or nutrionist?\u00a0\u00a0Getting the information from that visit might help also.\u00a0\u00a0When I was diagnosed my mom followed the same food plan as me.\u00a0\u00a0I liked it-maybe make sure you have all kinds of good snacks and meals when he is there and eat what he eats.\u00a0\u00a0It can be hard to communicate-I was 11 years old when I was diagnosed and found it hard to talk to my parents about diabetes and all the stuff I had to do.\u00a0\u00a0It is hard-maybe subtle ways of letting him know you really care can help.",

    "question": "I will give a little background here. I am a non-custodial parent who does not get to see my son often. He was diagnosed with type I a couple months ago and I have him over for my second weekend since then. I have read up what I can on this but I feel that my education is terribly inadequate. My son is 15 and is being rather rebellious. His mother warned me that he will try to snow me on what the schedule of things is and such but due to our circumstances we do not speak in much detail on many things I fear.Either way, my son claimed that his sugar levels were low and insisted on candies to balance it. I understand that this happens and deferred to what I assumed was his better knowledge. He shortly afterwards became quite pale and unwell. I called his mother and got quite soundly (and probably rightly) chewed out. As I said, my communication with his mom (and my son I fear) is not terribly good. What I want to know is where some basics can be found so that I can keep an eye on things until my son accepts things better and takes care of himself.I was given a form but I admit it is foreign to me.Breakfast 35 NPH 10 NRSupper 10 NR- 1NR- 20 CarbBedtime 15 NPH 3NR- 1NR - 20 CarbI sort of know some of that but am still somewhat lost. Could somebody point a sadly unprepared parent in the right direction?Thanks",
