            "answer": "I had a friend who put on weight for reasons like that.Just as putting on weight took time, taking off the weight will take time.\u00a0\u00a0I read a study that suggested you don't want to have the same calories every day; you want to go up and down a bit to keep your metabolism from shutting down.\u00a0\u00a0Like throw in a 1500-calorie day now and then.Make sure you drink water and unsweetened green tea for beverages.\u00a0\u00a0If dairy doesn't agree with you, try almond milk.\u00a0\u00a0Dairy is a problem for many, many people, and I notice that MILK is on every low-calorie traditional diet.\u00a0\u00a0It's hard to feel good if dairy is upsetting your system.Remember to make choices throughout your day that cause you to move instead of sit.\u00a0\u00a0Don't use elevators or escalators - use the stairs. Jumping rope is very slimming.\u00a0\u00a0Pilates can be done at home with very little equipment.\u00a0\u00a0Put on your favorite music and dance for your warmup.\u00a0\u00a0You won't even notice you are working your body and it elevates your mood.\u00a0\u00a0Abandon any foods that have been an every day staple because you will tend to eat them without thinking and eat too much of it.\u00a0\u00a0Load up on vegetables and eat fruit like apples every day.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of colorful, unprocessed food.\u00a0\u00a0Avoid breading and cook with olive oil when you can.\u00a0\u00a0Remove skin from chicken.\u00a0\u00a0Eat protein, including red meat, for the iron, but you only need a piece the size of a deck of cards.\u00a0\u00a0Try an egg scrambled with any leftover vegetables you have.\u00a0\u00a0You can use Go Veggie cheese shreds as a cheese alternative.",

            "answer": "How did you arrive at the decision to eat 1200 calories/day?\u00a0\u00a0That's not enough; your body will think it's starving and may hold onto fat, rather than letting it go.I calculated your Basic Metabolic Rate, which is the number of calories you need just to sustain life.\u00a0\u00a0This is based on they weight, height and age you posted above.\u00a0\u00a0Based on those numbers, your Basic Metabolic Rate is around 1800 calories/day; that's to keep your heart beating, kidneys, brain, digestions and other organs functioning.In order to lose weight, you need to either drop about 500 calories/day from that, making it 1300 calories/day, or it's easier to drop 250 calories and use up an extra 250 calories every day.\u00a0\u00a0This would help you lose 1 pound/week.I agree that it's important to vary your calories, as well as your exercise.\u00a0\u00a0It's also a good idea to keep a food diary, showing what you ate, how many calories, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Often, we tend to eat more than we think we are; writing it down, or tracking it, keeps it all in perspective.\u00a0\u00a0MedHelp has a good food diary, and there are also other ones available.\u00a0\u00a0Many can be synced to your mobile device, so you can even track calories on the go.\u00a0\u00a0I know of one, that even lets you scan the bar code and looks it up in the database, so you don't have to spend time searching.You don't\u00a0\u00a0have to do a lot of exercise; the key is to do it regularly.",
