            "answer": "hi...his triglycerides are very high. I cannot diagnose him because im not a physician. But as far as I know, if your father has a blood pressure of systolic >130 and diastolic of >90 for a very long time, it can cause damage to his vital organs. His is not overweight. Based on his lab results, his triglycerides are very high, it should be 40mg/dl. You should be able to know his cholesterol level.If you want to make him healthier, you should prepare foods that are according to the DASH diet (diet against hypertension). Give him lots of vegetables and fruits(2-4 kinds of fruits a day) and avoid fatty foods, processed foods, fast foods. A home cooked meal is always the best. He must at least eat 2 fatty fish in a week.\u00a0\u00a0He must do walking exercises 30 minutes everyday. If he really wanted to be strong, healthy and can live longer he must work his way to change his lifestyle.It is best to ask a physician point of view because he has the best answer to your questions.",
