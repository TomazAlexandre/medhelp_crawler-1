            "answer": "Hey MysticSoul9,You may want to look at the possible common etiologyof your symptoms, fibro and anxiety.Fibro is the most complicated to investigate, as the symptomology isso varied. Not being a disease,but rather a syndrome of symptomswith only suspected etiology, we need to make some assumptionsThere's evidence that underlying physical and emotional imbalances are the causative factors of FMS,manifesting\u00a0\u00a0when one is under\u00a0\u00a0excessive stress, trauma, serious injury or shock (triggers).So a possible connection to all three aforementioned conditions and symptoms, is an underlying undetected pathogenic infection,such as Lyme Disease (Canada is NOT an LD friendly country as any MDs treating Lyme Disease properly risk their careers!), pathogenic mycoplasma,mycotoxin infection etc.Another area worth investigating is nutritional deficiencies. B12, D3, Mg,are usually suspect in cases like yours. Need blood work and mineral tissue analysis.Stress levels, if high, must be managed, as chronic stress guaranteeschronic physical and emotional issues.Improper breathing would be a contributing factor as well.If you need more info or links for addressing the above, let me know.Hope this helps.Cheers,Niko",

            "answer": "Hello, my mother who has had fibro now for over 20 years had experienced that during the beginning of her diagnosis and pain. Her experience was worst when water touched or trinkled onto her skin. She had to bath instead of shower and that was a feat for her!! Since, that is no longer an issue for her, so hopefully that is something that will go away for you as well.",
