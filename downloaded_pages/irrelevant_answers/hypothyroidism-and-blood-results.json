            "answer": "The only painkiller that is safe to use in pregnancy is paracetamol (acetaminophen). Depending where you live, brand name is either panadol and tylenol. Paracetamol should be taken exactly as prescribed to reduce the risks of experiencing life threatening side effects.I reversed my insulin resistance cutting out all refined sugar in my diet (my reason for insulin resistance). Although to add, my insulin resistance worsened and I developed pre diabetes due to hyperthyroidism. I have reversed both conditions.After a bad diet, the second most common cause of elevated cholesterol is untreated/not optimally treated hypothyroidism. Statins deplete CoQ10 which is essential for energy and a healthy heart. The black box warning for statins - memory loss, confusion, high blood glucose, and type 2 diabetes.Excerpt from Dr Greg Emerson's article Cholesterol Reduction...\"Recent studies have shown no reductions in death in people over the age of 65 or people with no existing heart disease on statins (regardless of how much their cholesterol was lowered) and no benefit at all in women of any age. It is very important to understand statistics here and the difference between relative risk and absolute risk reduction.Much of the advertising with statins describe a 36% risk reduction in heart attacks. This is a relative risk reduction. The absolute risk reduction is a decrease from a 3% risk to a 2% risk. In practical terms, this means that in men under the age of 65 with pre-existing heart disease, 100 (the NNT- Number Needed to Treat) have to take a statin for 3 years to prevent 1 heart attack. The other 99 men receive no benefit.Professor James Wright from the University of British Columbia states that \u201cmost people taking statins are taking something with no chance of benefit and a risk of harm.\u201d\"It takes between 6 months and 2 years to fully reverse a fatty liver.\u00a0\u00a0Dr Sandra Cabot's article \"Fatty Liver - What Is Fatty Liver And How To Reverse It?\" goes into more detail on the 6 ways to reverse the condition: eat less carbohydrates (the biggest offenders are sugar and foods made of white flour); drink less alcohol; eat more vegetables, protein and the right fats; drink raw vegetable juices; take a good liver tonic containing milk thistle to support your liver function; take N Acetyl L Cysteine (NAC) to support production of glutathione in the liver.",

    "question": "So my latest blood work revealed that I need a dose change and that I'm insulin resistant. I am now taking 200mg of levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and 40mg of atorvastatin for cholesterol and fatty liver. I also take fish oil, multivitamin, D3, allegra, and baby aspirin. My medical provider is focusing on my thyroid before tackling everything else. I should also mention that my mother has non alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes, dementia, diverticulitis, and myopathy. I'm considering taking coQ10. I'm just wondering what is the safest otc pain medicine for me to use(ibuprofen, goodies), and is there anything else I should know?",
