            "answer": "It varies, alot of women can be stuck at a few cms for weeks and end up being overdue / induced, but it can also happen that you'll go into labour soon. I had gestational diabetes my last pregnancy. They induced me cos they said she'd probably be big.. she was only 6lb 6!! so please don't worry tooo much about size of baby. Relax and your baby will be here soon.. you'll ideally want to have a few more weeks for your baby to develop more, lungs etc aren't mature yet. And if you have a baby early, the higher risk of them needing to stay in hospital for a little while. Make the most of sleep these last few weeks :) and good luck! I wish you all the best.",

            "answer": "I'll be 36 weeks tomorrow and I hope I'm at least dilated 2cm when I go to my appt in the morning and not because that's a sign labor is near but because I won't have far to go when I'm actually in labor to get an epidural. Silly thinking I know but the pain scares me. The end is near and we will soon meet our sons but it's only when they will be ready which is fine with me even though I'm miserable",
