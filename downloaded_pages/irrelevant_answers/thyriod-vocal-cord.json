            "answer": "This is a question you may get answered here, or you may have better luck asking Dr. Lupo's opinion on the \"ask a doctor\" thyroid forum.If you scroll dowm the page and look to the right, you will find \"related expert forums\" listed. Thyroid, and Diabetes. If you click on thyroid, it will take you to the thyroid forum where Dr. Lupo answers questions.The number of questions allowed per day is limited, so you may have to try several times to get your question posted. It seems like a hassle, but it is set up that way so Dr. Lupo is not deluged with more questions than he can keep up with. He WILL answer your questions, once you get them posted to him.A few members here have had problems similar to yours, but I am not sure how much they can tell you about injections.I wish you both the best of luck getting an answer, and getting your problem resolved.",

It wasn't gradual, but was back almost overnight.\u00a0\u00a0The first day I sounded like a 13yr old boy, but then it was normal. I hope you will be the same. Good luck.Trish",

    "question": "Just wanted to ask another question. Im having to deside if I should have vocal cord injection or surgery.\u00a0\u00a0During my TT, my vocal cord was clipped. I have had to whisper since my surgery 6 months ago. It has been painful, hard to eat, drink and just function. Heres the question I was woundering if any body else had, had this happen to them. Also if you knew any thing about the injection or the surgery? Im a tad confused. One point I just want to have the surgery, so it will be done and over with. If I have the injection and it doesnt work I would have to have the surgery any ways. So then im going through 2 things. With my luck the injection wouldnt work. My voice has not improved at all. My left vocal cord does not move at all. If I drink some thing or eat something, I chock and it feels like im drowning. Wish scares me to death. Hope some one can help. Thank you",
