            "answer": "You need to make an appointment to see your doctor to get the correct diagnosis and treatment.By the description of your symptoms, you may have a bacterial infection as well as a fungal problem.You require the correct treatment for your eyes from your doctor and this is likely to be an antibiotic cream specifically for use on the eyes.Although you may have an allergic reaction to something, it is also very likely that your body is fighting a bacterial and/or fungal infection.I know it will be itchy and you have the urge to scratch.\u00a0\u00a0But you must NOT scratch.\u00a0\u00a0Scratching damages the delicate skin, it will thicken the skin and it can become a condition like Lichen Planus.\u00a0\u00a0If you start to itch, have a wash with cool water - do NOT use soap.\u00a0\u00a0Gently dry and apply natural live yogurt to your genitals.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor is likely to prescribe an antifungal cream for you to apply and/or an antifungal medication called Fluconazole.\u00a0\u00a0This comes in capsule form that you can also buy from the pharmacy without prescription.\u00a0\u00a0There is Fluconazole 150mg that is a single dose oral capsule and Fluconazole 50mg that comes in a pack of 7 which one capsule is taken daily for the 7 days.If you are sexually active, it would be a good idea to get checked out for any STD and also have your blood tested for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0One of the conditions with diabetes is itchy skin and fungal problems as well as having cuts that are difficult to heal.\u00a0\u00a0Through breaks in the skin you can get a bacterial infection.If you do have diabetes, it is important to keep your sugar levels controlled.\u00a0\u00a0If you do not have diabetes, then cut out or cut down on sugary and processed foods and fizzy drinks.\u00a0\u00a0Have a healthy a well balanced diet with lots of fruit and vegetables, drink more water and do some form of exercise even if it is just walking.It does sound like you have a skin infection, so do make an appointment to see your doctor for the correct diagnosis and the appropriate treatment.Should the doctor prescribe an antibiotic, ask for a prescription for an antifungal medication because taking antibiotics can bring about fungal infections like Thrush.Above all, make sure you keep good hygiene.Let me know how you get on.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "Don't use the cortisone junk in my opinion.\u00a0\u00a0It only treats symptoms at its best, and it can thin the skin and cause permanent damage.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know why it gets prescribed so often because its disappointing results cause people to over-use it.",

    "question": "I began to have an itchy penis and testicles around 3 weeks ago. The itching became severe and my penis shaft wept fluid from the constant scratching. This is only localised to my shaft, there is no itching on the head or under my foreskin.I also have very itchy and sore eyelids. They split and will not heal. I have used hydrocortisone cream on both to no avail. I also have a rash now developing on my thighs and chest.I also cut myself shaving around 2 weeks ago and the cuts will not heal. They are raised and red, and very itchy. I am unsure if this is related or not.Does anyone have any idea what this could be?",
