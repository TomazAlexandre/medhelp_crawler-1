    "question": "My PCP had said that he would take over my thyroid meds and take care of my diabetes if I had it, which I do.\u00a0\u00a0Type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Wednesday I went in and had fasting blood work done at my PCP's and he just called me with the results.\u00a0\u00a0On SATURDAY!\u00a0\u00a0Called me HIMSELF!\u00a0\u00a0He usually does, and it's usually about 8pm or on a Saturday or Sunday.Anyway, I talked to him about my TSH being too high for me, 1.32, and how I had all the hypo symtoms and he increased my levo!!\u00a0\u00a0YEAH!!\u00a0\u00a0He's increasing me from 125mg to 137mg.\u00a0\u00a0Am hoping this will make all the difference in the world how I feel.\u00a0\u00a0Really think it will.He's also taking care of my diabetes for me.\u00a0\u00a0Been on low carb for almost 5 weeks now and my A1C came back at 6.8 which he considers border line.\u00a0\u00a0But it's that low b/c I've kept it down the last month so he knows I am for sure diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Never doubted it after fasting bloos sugar of 204.Praise the Lord I can lay off the endo and tell her mean nurse good riddance!And the good news it that with the meds for my diabetes and getting the numbers under control I have lost 9 1/2 lbs. in 4 1/2 weeks!!!!!!\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah for me.\u00a0\u00a0;-D\u00a0\u00a0Now I get on my new level of levo and hopefully I'll feel good enough to quit being a slug and it will really come off.Can't get my new levo yet, cause I don't have a driver's license any more.\u00a0\u00a0Got any idea what it takes in Oklahoma to get a new license when you let the old one expire?\u00a0\u00a0A LOT!\u00a0\u00a0And all just to prove you really are an American citizen.\u00a0\u00a0Sheesh.Dac",
