            "answer": "Could be mucus plug. They say it could be all kinds of colors. Pink, yellow, brown etc. When ur cervix starts softening it's not strong enough to hold in the mucus plug anymore so u start losing it sometimes gradually over time and sometimes all at once. Could also be ur amniotic fluid though. They say it should be clear but sometimes it can b pink tinged",

        {
            "answer": "It could. It definitely means there is a change in ur cervix. U could be dilating already which is why ur cervix isn't holding the mucus plug. But don't worry too much though because if nothing progresses soon then ur body will just create more mucus. With my last pregnancy my doctor stripped the membranes and I lost my mucus plug right after that and had him that night. If u don't know what stripping the membranes is, it just means ur doc inserts fingers into ur cervix and tries to pull the amniotic sac away from the wall of the uterus so that way the hormones that create labor and softens ur cervix can pass through more easily. If u are wiping up pink every time u go to the bathroom and it's thick then it's ur mucus plug, but if it's watery and thin I would go get checked. But sometimes spotting is normal after sex and what not too..",
