            "answer": "Everyone's body is so different with symptoms that it is hard to say. Have you checked your glucose levels when you feel like this? It kind of sounds like low blood sugar symptoms which seems to be increased when our thyroid levels are out of wack. Get yourself a glucose meter from the drugstore and test yourself. Then you will be able to rule it out or in. If it is low, then you know you need to eat every 3 hours to keep your glucose level even. Before I reached optimum levels with my thyroid, I was having major issues with low blood sugar. Just my thoughts for you. :)",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and prescribed Levothyroxine (0.05MG).I have most of the symptoms listed with the condition, but I have another - the most debilitating of all - that is not listed.\u00a0\u00a0It is difficult to describe - but - I call it a \"head freeze\" sensation.\u00a0\u00a0It's awful, also I might describe it as a sensation of the 'head' falling asleep as when a hand falls asleep, a prickly feeling, and almost a coma feeling.\u00a0\u00a0All I can do is lie down until it passes.\u00a0\u00a0The reason I believe it's connected is that it comes on to a lesser or greater extent a few minutes after eating, after I start to metabolize.\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone tell me anything about this?\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone else report this kind of thing?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you",
