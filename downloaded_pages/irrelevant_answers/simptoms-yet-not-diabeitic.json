All I know is what the Dr's tell me and they tell me they don't know because the tests keep coming out ok. Any ideas?",

            "answer": "Some of those symptoms by themselves can be symptoms of diabetes but taken as a whole I would say they are not symptoms of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My guess is that if the tests keep coming back negative these symptoms are not from diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0But I am not a Dr. so perhaps they are correct.\u00a0\u00a0Dizzy can be from diabetes but sounds to me like it is related to your heart problems and high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0Sores not healing and changing eye sight can be related to diabetes but many other things as well.\u00a0\u00a0I can not speculate a diagnosis but I can say does not seem like it is diabetes or if it is from diabetes you have other problems going on as well.\u00a0\u00a0Go back to Dr. for more tests and see if they can find the real problem.",

            "answer": "Your blur vision can be high blood pressure, and so can your dizzyness, and if u are on med's for high blood pressure u can have both symptoms from the side effects from the medicine.You say u have heart problems, diabetes after many yrs can cause heart disease. What are the heart problems you speak of. And to just take a one time glucose is not a good idea, U should have a glucose tolerence test and a A1c done. It tells a much bigger story. Your wound healing can also be related to your currculation problems from the heart issues. Do u smoke? Or are u over weight? You can go to the top of this page to the left and ask a DR this question also. best of wishes for a diagnoses to help your get rid of these nagging symptoms.",

            "answer": "KevinHamey and straberriI want to thank you both for responding to my question.The Drs. have been looking for the cause of my symptoms sense 1989. They send me from Dr. to Dr. and do test after test but they aren't coming up with any conclusions. They do all kinds of blood tests every four months. I don't smoke but I am about 50 pounds overweight even though I am very active. About 6 months ago I became a vegetarian thinking there could be something in my diet that is causing some of the symptoms. I grow 80% of the food that I eat. I grow totally organic. My Drs. say I am doing all the right things to be healthy except for the extra weight. Anyway, I want to thank you both for your advice. You have both been very kind. My search will continue.",

    "question": "I am 53 and my blood sugar reads 108 at my last testing. I have been tested many times by different Drs. They always say the test was negative. Yet they say I have all the typical symptoms. They just say they don't know why I have the symptoms yet not the disease. Do you know why? Is it possible to have diabetes yet not show up in my blood? Or do you have an idea what it could be? Thank you, bunnye13",
