            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Weak erection can be caused by emotional and physical factors. Emotional factors like stress, anxiety, depression have a role to play.Also diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, low testosterone levels and inadequate blood supply to the penis might cause weak erection. To improve ejaculation strength, eat a healthy diet, get plenty of exercise, don't do drugs or smoke, drink plenty of water.Reduced urinary stream can occur with ureteral stones or urethral stricture. As you already have the history of stones in the kidney or ureter, there is a chance of recurrence. Get an ultrasound done and consult a urologist for further assistance.All the best.",
