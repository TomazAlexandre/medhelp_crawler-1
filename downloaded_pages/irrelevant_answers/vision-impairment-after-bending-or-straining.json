    "question": "Almost every time I am bent down for a period of time to, for example, wash a floor or lift things off the ground, I will notice a black circle in each eye that sometimes appears as a semi-circle once I am standing again. It doesn't really affect my vision, but they are clearly there. After about 5 minutes or so they fade away completely, until I repeat the action again. I have suffered with migraines of all varied degrees for 12 years and I am used to seeing black spots, flashers, etc., before an attack, but sometimes a migraine or headache will hit after seeing these circles, and other times I get the circles with no indication of pain. Any one have an idea of what might be going on? Thanks.",
