You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Common disorders causing numbness of the hands are carpal tunnel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis,transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.Treatment will depend on the diagnosis.In case you need more information then pls post us. Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
