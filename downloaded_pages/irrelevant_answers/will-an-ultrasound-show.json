            "answer": "Yeah, don't be in a rush at 34 weeks to want the baby out.\u00a0\u00a0At this point, every added week gives the baby a lot, and you don't want to wish on any child the stress that a preemie goes through.\u00a0\u00a0Do everything you can with your diet to reduce the bloating and discomfort, cut back on salt to nothing, and of course with GD watch the carbs and sugars like a hawk.\u00a0\u00a0It can really help even at this stage of pregnancy, and make you feel a lot better.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!\u00a0\u00a0Annie",

    "question": "Hello everyone. I am 34 weeks along and have an ultrasound scheduled for tomorrow. I am just wondering if it will show if I am dialated any???? I know I still have a while but I have gained so much weight and am so swollen (and have gestational diabetes) I want my baby to come out!!! I am so excited to see her that I can hardly stand it (husband and I have tried for 14 years)!!!!! and finally it happened on its own. Also I have already had 3 ultrasounds since I was 20 weeks and the tech has said everytime that it was a girl do you think it is safe to assume that is what I am having? (I hope so everything is pink)!!!!!!",
