            "answer": "Hi and welcome to the GERD forum.Weight plays a large role in GERD issues, and weight loss for those that are over weight is always suggested.SO, the lap band will help with that aspect, reducing the weight....but, if that is not the only reason u have GERD, it will not rid u of the problem.In fact post op u may find an increase in symptoms as the drugs used during surgery can cause GERD to flare up.With time and diet modification as well as lifestyle changes u may see a reduction in ur symptoms...have u talked to ur GI dr concerning this?",

            "answer": "Selma is right, there are no guarantees, but the lapband surgery appears to be so successful on so many levels from my persective, I'd sure consider it.\u00a0\u00a0I'm in a volunteer position where I meet, visit with, encourage and counsel with people with digestive and heart issues, and overwhelmingly I'm told that the procedure is a game-changer and life-changer.\u00a0\u00a0The rewards sound to me like they trump the losses.I'd make sure you have a good surgeon with a good track record, select someone with experience.\u00a0\u00a0The advantages are many, from what I've been told.\u00a0\u00a0Certainly, a loss of weight controls diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes just hammers the organs in the body.\u00a0\u00a0Loss of weight equals gain of mobility, less stress on the heart and lowers blood pressure which reduces the risk of stroke...There is a chance that your digestive processes will be compromised, but given the risk/rewards, I'd suggest you strongly investigate the lapband procedure.\u00a0\u00a0I have a young friend I helped train to do a volunteer position, she could hardly walk, she was morbidly obese.\u00a0\u00a0She met me on the elevator, and this lovely lady hugged me, and asked if I knew her.\u00a0\u00a0I sorted it out, but she lost over 135 pounds, and has gone from hardly able to walk to taking Kick-Boxing classes!\u00a0\u00a0We had coffee and I asked her about her digestion.\u00a0\u00a0She replied she's fine as long as she follows her diet. She pays a price for backsliding.If you have the means to have the lapband procedure, have a surgeon with lots of experience, meet with a dietician and agree to follow a post-surgery diet, I'd go ahead.\u00a0\u00a0There are always trade-offs, natural is always better, but interventional surgery can keep you walking on the sunnyside of the earth.\u00a0\u00a0GERD is easier to deal with than diabetes, heart disease, strokes, etc.",
