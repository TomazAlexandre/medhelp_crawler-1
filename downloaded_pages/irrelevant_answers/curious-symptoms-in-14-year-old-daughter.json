            "answer": "Hello,Normal fasting should be in the low to mid 80s.\u00a0\u00a0Post eating should also be in the low to mid-80s in a person without diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Normal numbers for children can be even lower (ie. in the 70s).Her fasting levels of 100 - 115 raise a red flag for me.\u00a0\u00a0This could possibly be very early diabetes, despite her numbers during the day being normal.\u00a0\u00a0Given her age and activity level it could be very early type 1.Would recommend getting her HbA1c tested to get a baseline for monitoring.\u00a0\u00a0Do also keep testing (and recording) her fasting post eating (1 1/2 - 2 hrs post eating), from time to time (maybe 1 day a week) so you can catch it early if things get worse.\u00a0\u00a0If her dr is willing you could also ask them to test C-Peptide (monitors how much insulin she is producing), and antibodies.Would strongly recommend that she follows a lower carb diet (to reduce stress on her pancreas) and keeps up with the exercise.I think you are wise to monitor this closely.\u00a0\u00a0Please also read up on the symptoms of Type 1, so you can get early attention if she should have these symptoms\u00a0\u00a0(sometimes things can go from normal to abnormal very quickly).I hope this is just over reacting, but do beleive it is better to err on the side of caution in this case.",

    "question": "My daughter, age 14, has curious symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Family history of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Currently she has frequent headaches which seem to improve with food intake.\u00a0\u00a0She also suffers with some dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0She has VCD which I don't think is related to these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0She is an athlete and in very good shape physically and not overweight.\u00a0\u00a0What I find most curious is her fasting glucose is in the 100-115 range but taken randomly throughout the day it is in the 80s for the most part.\u00a0\u00a0Is there cause for concern?\u00a0\u00a0She has been seen in recent months by an endocronologist as she was anemic when she first hit puberty with heavy periods but that now is under control.\u00a0\u00a0As a side note, when she was very young she would get \"mean\" if she didn't eat often enough, as she aged she learned to eat as she felt the symptoms coming on.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be hypoglycemia in some form even with high fasting numbers?",
