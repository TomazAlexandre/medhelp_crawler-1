            "answer": "Hi penni remember you from long ago then i did not come on the site for a while always kept in touch with doni i got a dx for fibro but since i got worse they are thinking MS again or something else so back in the testing process so back on here.Sounds like you are really positive and getting on with life, My dad had diabetes had to go straight onto insulin unfortunatly he had just lost my mum his wife and went to drinking so ilost him to diabetes but that was his choice as he gave up on life as could not live without mum, so i know it sure is a battle and you should be proud of yourself my separated husbands dad has diabetes and he tackled it like you and went from insulin to tablet control and diet control so it can be done.Sorry you lost a close friend that must of been so upsetting, but like you said they in a better place just like my mum and dad.happy catching uplove sam",

    "question": "Hey, everybody! I've been away for a month or 2 and thought I'd check in before Quix sends anybody out with cement shoes, lol!Doing quite well, all in all; although the neurological symptoms have been creeping back out of their hiding places, most recently spazapalooza has returned with a vengeance. I refuse to let it get me down this time. The \"newbie\" this time is cold spots (not to outdo the wet spots - they're back too). In good spirits though and just too da-- stubborn to let it keep me from ANYTHING this time. I am back into my volunteer work full force (so I am a happy camper) and work is really crazy!On the diabetes front, I am kicking butt and taking names! I am walking 3 miles at least 5X/ week - starting to go 3.5 and increasing the speed. I have lost 30# so far, and my blood sugar is generally in the 90's!!! The endocrinologist had dropped my insulin dose once already (only Dx in October - was in 500's then). He says if I keep it up, I'll be completely off insulin in a year - woo hoo!!!Lost a dear friend this week to bone cancer - 38 years old with 2 kids. She was a phenominally strong woman - never knew she was sick till the fall. She never missed a beat and never let the pain show. I am awed by her and will miss her terribly. Funeral was this morning. She too worked with people with mental retardation. That's how we met. I feel our purpose here on earth is to leave it a better place for our having been here -\u00a0\u00a0my friend's work here was done; definitely a better place.Hope all are doing well - I surely have a ton of reading to catch up on and countless new \"faces\" to get acquainted with! I hope not to be such a stranger - need to take the time. Diabetes is a full time job though!!Love to all,Penn",
