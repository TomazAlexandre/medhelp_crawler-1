            "answer": "Everything I have read says this is not the time to lose weight. You can be healthy and maintain for a while, but even if you are over weight you should gain at least 15 lbs over your pregnancy. After the baby is when you can concentrate on losing. I would talk to your dr about a healthy pregnancy diet and what their suggestions are for weight gain for you.",

    "question": "So I know you're not suppose to \"diet.\"\u00a0\u00a0But I'm trying to eat healthier smaller meals, cut out the sugary drinks, more water, lots more vegetables, etc. And I'm working out more as well. So I hope to lose some weight. I think this is OK, does anyone disagree? My BMI is 30 which is high. I'm thinking a 15 lb weight loss would do us both good. I'm 5wks. Anyone else trying to drop some pounds?",
