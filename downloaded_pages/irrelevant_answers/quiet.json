            "answer": "yes it has been alitle quiet. I am so excited to be almost there and I can't wait to meet my little girl. I guess I am afraid that something horrible will happen before she gets here. I have heard many horror stories of woman loosing their baby right before they are born. I am terrified it will happen to me. My main concern is that the cord will get wrapped around her neck ( I know someone that this happened to) I need to stop looking on the internet and seeing this awful situations. I also really would like to have a natural birth and I hope I'm not to dispointed if that doesn't happen.",

            "answer": "nini- my mom said when i was born my cord was wrapped twice around my neck..my face was blue, but everything ended fine!i guess im not really nervous about anything in particular. just the norm. how everything is going to go. this is my first. my sis just delivered her 2nd baby girl on july 29th. and it was very encouraging to watch. i just want everything to go as smoothly as possible. the only thing that me and my husband are concerned about it when will my water break. he owns his own buisness and the drive is about 45 mins from our house. he is also the only person there. he does everything on his own. so it will be a task to get all customers and cars out of the shop. and the hosp drive is about 45 mins away from our house. so i may have to go to work with him. the nurse at the office i go to is a close friend so she said that my doc would induce me at 38 weeks. so that may be the safest route to go. we will see! Other than that I just cant wait to meet Jamin!",

In those cases I'm completely fine with going in another direction). I just want to have a voice and not be treated like an ill patient who needs all these unnecessary interventions.AND I have to take the 3-hour GTT tomorrow. Yay for me. Not!",

I have taken the gestational diabetes test about 4 weeks ago and I was diagnose w/gestational diabetes. My doctor indictated that it had nothing to do with the way I am eating, it's because I am carrying two babies. I believe everything will work out just fine for all of us. Take Care!",
