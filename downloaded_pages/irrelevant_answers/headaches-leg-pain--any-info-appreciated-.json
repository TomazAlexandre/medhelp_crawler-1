            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The various causes of leg pain are atherosclerosis, deep vein thrombosis - leg pain on walking (A blood clot in a deep vein), Leriche syndrome (block in abdominal aorta and/or main leg artery), limb ischaemia (low oxygen to limbs), sciatica, spondylitis of lower vertebrae and peripheral vascular disease (arteries of limbs are involved). A color Doppler test will rule out the possibility of involvement of an artery or vein and its blockage by a clot. Paresthesias or abnormal sensations which can include pain also can be due to diabetes, thyroid disorders, Lyme's or lupus should also be ruled out.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

    "question": "Hello, I am 29 year old female 4\"11 127 lbs. I am a non-smoker/no alcohol. I was diagnosed with graves disease in 2002, but my thyroid levels have balanced out and and I am no longer taking PCU. I have been suffering from leg pain mainly right leg, but will sometimes switch to left leg or both at the same time. The leg pain usually occurs out of no where, the cold only makes it worst. The pain is often so painful that it is unbearable to walk. I remember have this leg pain as far back as 7yrs old. I also have severe headaches that are sharp throbbing pains, or what feels like intense pressure. I have recently begun experiencing mild chest tighening and what feels like a heavyness in my chest. I have been checked for PAD, had MRI's, EKG's,CAT scans all back negative. Please help as I am worried if I will be able to care for my children, as the symptoms appear to get worst as I get older. Thank you",
