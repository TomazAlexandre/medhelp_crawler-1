I guess sweets are out but I heard you also have to watch carbs. Well, hopefully all will be well with my little girl. Guess it's better they find out so they can monitor. How are things with you aribear? What kind of stuff do you have to do to manage it??",

            "answer": "Well, I met with a dietician on Friday and I have to watch my diet. Watching the carbs and sweets, which STINKS :(. I have altered my diet and my blood sugar number have been great. I have to test right when I wake up in the morning and then two hours after my meals. My doctor wants to keep my morning blood under 100 and under 120 after meals. So far, it has been OK. I do miss the sweets, but I have gotten myself some Dark Chocolate Hershey Kisses, which help. I have like one or two at my snack time, which gives me a bit of sweet relief :). I also lost weight in the last two weeks since I had to do this. I am eating a lot more fruits and veggies, which is good for both me and the little guy. I will say, it hasn't been too bad, but I do miss the occasional soda, which is my downfall. If you are seeing a dietician, he/she will give you an eating plan, which has helped tremedously for me. Tells you exactly how much of things you can have. My doctor did say that because of the diabetes and my hypothyroidism, I will be going to weekly appointments at 32 weeks, which is just four weeks away for me. Also, have to have monthly ultrasounds to monitor his development/growth. I will say, after he is born, I am so having a cupcake :)!!!!",

            "answer": "How are you doing Aribear? My GD is not doing so well!! I went last week for my first visit and they told me to take my blood sugar and to watch my carbs and to write down everything I eat. I went back yesterday and my fasting blood sugars have mostly been a little elevated so since I'm doing everything right diet wise, I had to start insulin last night! So frustrating!! I can't help but worry and hope that everything will be alright with my little girl. I'm going weekly now but haven't started the ultrasounds yet - I think they start at 30 weeks and I'm almost at 28 weeks. I lost 2 lbs in the first week - they said it was common but it's weird as I havent gained a lot to begin with\u00a0\u00a0- around 12 lbs. How about you??",

Of course, since I am not supposed to have any sweets, that is all I want :). Anyone else dealing with this?? I am hoping I can control it with diet and that my little one won't grow too big...",
