            "answer": "Hi!I am not sure what you mean, but if you were given instructions to use this pen, it means you have diabetes and have to take insulin for it. Your diabetes nurse educator will help you learn how to use the pen and set your insulin dose. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
