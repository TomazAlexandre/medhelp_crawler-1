            "answer": "It's quite common for one with Hashimoto's to have periods of hyperthyroidism in the early stages.Your symptoms, however, particularly, the thirst and dehydration, hunger and eating more with weight loss, pale, itchy skin and red bumps are more indicative of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest that you get tested for that, along with getting your thyroid hormones levels tested asap.With your history of, both, hyper and hypothyroidism, you should be getting your thyroid levels tested every 3-4 months, if not more often.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your help. I just took a diabetes symptom quiz and I do seem to have a lot of the symptoms. The thing is that my blood sugar has always been in the normal range. I took a type 2 diabetes risk quiz and got a score of 0 (very low risk), so I'm guessing I'm more likely to have type 1? But type 1 usually starts before age 20 doesn't it?Unfortunately, getting labs done could take a while... My primary care doctor recently moved out of state, so now I have to find a new PCP and I don't know how long it's going to take. Also, I'm still looking for a good endocrinologist and good endocrinologists seem to take FOREVER to get an appointment with. The two endocrinologists I've seen so far weren't very helpful. I recently made an appointment with a new endocrinologist (which someone on this site recommended), but it's not until March.",

            "answer": "Type I diabetes is also called Juvenile Diabetes and is often diagnosed in children, but no - it doesn't have to be diagnosed before age 20.\u00a0\u00a0My son was diagnosed at age 10.\u00a0\u00a0 I have a nephew diagnosed in his 30's and a sister diagnosed in late 60's - all Type I.Diabetes is like thyroid conditions - can hit anyone, anytime, at any age.\u00a0\u00a0Type I diabetes is autoimmune, while Type II is not.\u00a0\u00a0Autoimmunes do not discriminate by age or gender.Even though your fasting blood sugars have been in the normal range, you should ask your doctor for a Glucose Tolerance Test, which is where your blood sugar is tested, you drink a syrupy liquid, then your blood sugar is tested again at intervals to determine how well your body handles the sugar.\u00a0\u00a0You should also ask for a hemoglobin A1c test, which tells what your blood sugar levels are over a 3 month period, so even if your fasting blood sugar is normal, the A1c will tell you if your blood sugar is spiking at various times.",

    "question": "Recently I've been having some strange symptoms and I suspect that they could possibly be related to hyperthyroidism.Here are my symptoms:* Over the past couple of weeks I have had loose stools on and off, especially in the morning after eating. Bowel movements that are more frequent than normal.* Muscle spasms on and off. Last night my eyelid kept twitching for hours. This morning I woke up with my entire body spasming and twitching.* Dehydration - I drink close to a gallon of water a day and wake up moderately dehydrated most days. I also drink water at night and wake up really thirsty.* Recently I've been hungry all the time and eating much more than I usually do, but I've actually lost some weight. I've alway been skinny, but now I'm almost underweight.* Pale skin on face (comes and goes).* Mild thyroid enlargement (no nodules, based on a thyroid ultrasound that was done in July 2014).* Very itchy skin (comes and goes) with itchy red bumps.Additional facts:My thyroid hormones have been fluctuating a lot for the past 3-4 years. I have a history of hyperthyroidism and mild hypothyroidism. Last year was diagnosed with Hashimoto's. I've had heart palpitations (PVCs and PACs), thinning of hair, dry skin and black bags under my eyes for the past 2-3 years.Here are my most recent antibody tests (done in August 2014):TPO Ab: 781 iu/ml (range: <5) HTg Ab: 83.9 iu/ml (range: 0-19) HTSI: 44% (range: < 140%)My thyroid hormones haven't been checked since the summer, so I don't know what their values are.Could the above symptoms mean that I'm hyperthyroid or is this something else?",
