There is a website that explains blood tests but I think more importantly you need to communicate with a dr. you trust.Part of the problem with my dad is that he had too many drs. and not enough communication between them.I think I might be worried too if the dr. started new meds based on one lab result. You would think he would start out with diet changes and education before starting a medication.What kind of doctor is her primary? I like internal medicine doctors and they can refer to other specialists. Just make sure each knows what the others' plans are. It takes a lot of hard work to navigate through a parents medical problems. I empathise with you and wish you luck. here's a website:http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/glucose/test.html",

Pycogenol also protects the liver.\u00a0\u00a0The study was based on taking 200 to 400mg a day.\u00a0\u00a0It's best to break the dose to twice a day.http://www.google.com/search?q=glucose+pine+bark&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:officialhttp://www.google.com/search?hl=en&hs=WEd&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&ct=result&cd=1&q=pycnogenol+harmful+to+liver&spell=1Hope this helps.",

    "question": "My mother is 66 and a recovering alcoholic for 6 years.\u00a0\u00a0She has cirhossis, and has been hospitalized with bleeding esophageal varicies (she takes inderall and propanonol)and pancreatitis.\u00a0\u00a0In 2003 she was diagnosed with leukemia.\u00a0\u00a0She just finished her chemo last spring.\u00a0\u00a0She recently had a visit for a blood work-up to her general doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Her fasting glucose revealed that her glucose was 137.\u00a0\u00a0Her doctor assumed that she must now have diabetes, and prescribed oral diabetic medication.\u00a0\u00a0I am VERY concerned about this new med, and told my mom not to take the medicine until we see a gastro.\u00a0\u00a0While going through the chemo, my mother had to be hospitalized several times because her body just couldn't handle the toxins.\u00a0\u00a0She also had to have several liters of fluid removed from her abdomen.\u00a0\u00a0I would like to call a gastro office first thing tomorrow morning to take my mother to be seen before she starts this medicine.\u00a0\u00a0I'm concerned that the new drugs would be more harm than good.\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts on this?\u00a0\u00a0Is a gastro the right choice, or is an endocrinologist a better option?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks so much in advance for any help!",
