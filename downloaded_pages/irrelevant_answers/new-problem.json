            "answer": "Hi there,There are several conditions which can cause rise in GFR like hypoproteinemia, high blood pressure, diabetes, constriction of the efferent arteriole due to high blood pressure etc. What are the symptoms you have been having? In kidney disease there would be excess fluid in the body, difficulty breathing, excessive lethargy, and confusion etc.You may need other blood tests like hemoglobin estimation, white cell *****, serum electrolytes, ultrasound etc to detect if you are suffering from kidney problem. A clinical correlation of test results is important. Do consult a nephrologist and keep me posted.Best luck and regards!",

    "question": "I am 45, have never had high blood pressure in fact it sometimes can be low, and I also do not have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0There is no kidney disease in my family that I am aware of.\u00a0\u00a0However some routine bloods showed I had an egfr of 54 ! (Panic)\u00a0\u00a0my GP however told me when looking at my results that \"yes no problems your kidney function is normal!\"\u00a0\u00a0It was only after I asked if he was sure that he said oh well we will repeat them and you just need to drink more.\u00a0\u00a0A repeat showed my eGFR was up to 61 and a trace protein in my urine, along with ++ epithilial cells and white bloods cells.\u00a0\u00a0Repeat bloods two weeks later showed that my eGFR had come up to 70, and I had no protein in my urine!\u00a0\u00a0I am confused if not a little worried!\u00a0\u00a0As soon as I found out I have modified already the amount of protein in my diet, stopped drinking cola (do I need to?) and have weaned myself of Topirimate and Sertreline that I have been taking for a couple of years.I have an appointment to see a nephrologist at the end of May but could do with any advice.\u00a0\u00a0I am most worried about why this has happened as nothing that I have looked at on the net so far fits me at all with regards to possible causes.Thanks",
