            "answer": "@dbrittanyl that happned to me.. I lost ten pounds I'm 21 weeks and trying to gain it back. Once you gain it back and you are at you're prepregnancy weight would you count that also? So lets say I weighed 115 at the start went down to 105 and am now 117 would I have gained 12 pounds or 2 pounds? I am confused by it BC my Dr always asks what my weight was before pregnancy.. not if I lost then gained it back..",

I lost fifteen pounds from morning sickness and vomiting, and finally started gaining weight at 29 weeks, now at 37+ 4 I've gained 19 pounds which makes a whole four pounds past my pregnancy weight.
