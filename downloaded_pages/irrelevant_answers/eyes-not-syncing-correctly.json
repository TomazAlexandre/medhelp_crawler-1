    "question": "I am 20 years old and work as a computer technician and. I spend most of my time looking at screens and the inner workings of computer hardware at the 5 foot to 6 inch range all day and have 20/15 vision as of my last checkup 2 months ago. I also get about 6 hours of sleep every night. I was working on a system and talking to a coworker when my eyes just sort of wandered off center and out of focus and I couldn't control them, this lasted for about a minute and then went away. I didn't have any pain or discomfort other than the lack of control freaked my out. It hasn't happened again though. Any ideas about why this happened?",
