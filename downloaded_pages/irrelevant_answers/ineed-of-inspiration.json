            "answer": "Hi there,PCOD occurs due to imbalances in the hormonal system which makes ovulation irregular and causing other changes in the body. Drug like Clomiphene is used as first line drug for treatment of PCOS related infertility since it helps in ovulation dysfunction. It has been observed that approximately 60-70 percent ovulate after taking Clomiphene. Provera is used for inducing your periods. The timing of starting Clomiphene depends on your medical condition and your treating doctor. Along with Clomiphene lifestyle modifications like weight control, exercise are very important to improve the success rates of Clomiphene.Tamoxifen and gonadotropins are other drugs which can help women with PCOS to get pregnant. Usually six cycles of Clomiphene are given and if you're ovulating but have not become pregnant after six months of treatment with Clomifene, you will be offered up to six cycles of intrauterine insemination in addition to Clomiphene.The pregnancy rate is about 15 per cent in patients with PCOD taking Clomiphene, but success depends on the length of treatment and other factors, such as whether you are overweight. It varies woman to woman. Do clarify your doubts with the treating gynecologist. Write to us again and keep me posted.Take care and regards!",

            "answer": "Hi,thank you so much for replying.the thing is i went to a gynae before i fel pregnant the 1st time,thats when i was diagnosed with PCOS.he was just so mean,and all he told me was i will never fall pregnant and if i do i would either lose in 1st trimester or have a stilborn.i was so distraught.then the other gynae that i saw while i was pregnant made me continue with folic acid after the D&C he said that id fall pregnant eventually and didnt even comment on the PCOS of which i had told him i was diagnosed with.im at such a loss with this whole situation.my gp thinks i should hold on before i fall pregnant due to al my sickness and stress.i heard about clomid from my friend,and my physcian thats treating me for my diabetes told me that the metformin wil help with the PCOS.i wish i knew wat to do or where to turn to.i feel so depressd that i am the reason why my husband and i cant have a baby.",

            "answer": "I do not have PCOS, but from what you write it sounds to me like you need a new doctor!\u00a0\u00a0I've read many success stories about women with PCOS having healthy and happy babies.\u00a0\u00a0(You can search this site for \"PCOS pregnancy\" and probably find a lot of hits.)Were you seeing a regular gyn?\u00a0\u00a0You may also want to consult with a reproductive endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0My RE (actually, the team of RE's at the clinic I went to) were all wonderful, very helpful, good at explaining my odds/risks/etc., being realistic while still being supportive.In general of course you want your health and stress to be at their best before TTC, but really there is never a \"perfect\" time.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck going forward.",
