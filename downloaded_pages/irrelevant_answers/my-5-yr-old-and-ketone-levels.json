    "question": "I took my 5 year old to the pediatrician yesterday because I suspected a bladder infection.\u00a0\u00a0When they tested her urine, there was no sugar in her urine but her ketones were 160.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have a clue what this mens other than that the pediatrician said we needed to test it again after she gets over this illness, which turned out to be strep throat.\u00a0\u00a0I am just trying to find out what this could mean.\u00a0\u00a0The pediatrician said that her strep didn't have anything to do with it and that we would test it again in the morning next week.\u00a0\u00a0Is it better to do this with a blood test?\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned and want to be sure I am doing the right thing.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for any info you can give me.",
