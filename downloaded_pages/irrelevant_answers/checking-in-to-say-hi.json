            "answer": "Hi Sally girl.\u00a0\u00a0If it makes you feel any better, nausea and vomiting are actually signs that the pregnancy is very healthly and progressing normally.\u00a0\u00a0Try to remember that, when the smell of a piece of toast, makes you want to hurl chunks across the room.\u00a0\u00a0(Boy, Forum, didn't I say that eloquently?)When I carried my son, I was vomiting for almost 6 months. (After all those months of vomiting he still weighed in at almost 9 pounds)\u00a0\u00a0With my daughter, I vomited in the last month.\u00a0\u00a0Horrible to be 8 months pregnant and hanging onto the bathroom toilet at 3 am, weak bladder (use your imagination here)...huge belly hanging in the way and releasing every single thing I had to eat that day.\u00a0\u00a0Oh boy, that was fun.\u00a0\u00a0Result, two healthy babies and much loved babies at that.\u00a0\u00a0Funny how you never forget the \"joys\" of pregnancy, even 30+ years later.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't trade one minute of it, my friend.As you know, I am following you closely on the Pregnancy Forum and will continue to watch over you from afar.\u00a0\u00a0The second trimester is coming.\u00a0\u00a0Feelings of actual joy of being pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Great months...Big hugs and much love, to you and the \"little bean,\"Heather",

    "question": "Hi,I've been AWOL lately.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry all.Just wanted to let you know I'm doing ok.\u00a0\u00a0As some of you know I'm now about 2 months pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I am considered a high risk pregnancy (given age, hypothyroid, pituitary and other unidentified issues), so there's been lots of dr. visits, but so far all looks ok though they are monitoring me very closely, and have already put me on a gestational diabetes diet (which is not so easy when you also have to eat gluten free).Been tired and dealing with 24/7 nausea and haven't yet announced the pregnancy and have to keep up with normal activities, work etc, so there's been relatively little net time.However, I've been reading posts and keeping up at least a little with what you're all doing.\u00a0\u00a0You're all in my thoughts and prayers.Best wishes to you forum family.Sally",
