            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for your question. From the symptoms you describe, it sounds that it could be a circulatory disturbance (due to compression of blood vessels) or a nerve pinched.\u00a0\u00a0This may most likely occurs due to any clots in blood vessels, excessive alcohol use or diabetes. I would suggest evaluating all the possibilities with the help of a doctor first. Further referral to a neurologist will surely help you in getting a more precise opinion here. Hope this information proves help you.",

            "answer": "I have constant tingling and numbness in my right hand, which started off on the outside of the baby and ring finger. It has now spread to the whole finfers and down the palm of my hand. Over the past three months, my hand will go ice cold, usually while I am working at the computer.Neuro thinks I have degenerative disc disease and one area of the C spine does show nerve impingement that could cause this. Will be bringing this up with her during my next appointment at the end of the month.Do not have any reactions to a hot shower.",

    "question": "I've been experiencing intermittent tingling/pins and needles/burning in my hands and feet for the past month.\u00a0\u00a0When I take a hot shower the soles of my feet start tingling badly and sometimes this spreads further up my leg.\u00a0\u00a0I also get feelings of 'goosebumps' on my calves.\u00a0\u00a0My extremeties feel very cold at times but often only one hand while the other is warm.\u00a0\u00a0I had these symptoms some months ago but they went away and I didn't think about it again until they reappeared last month.\u00a0\u00a0At first I put it down to bad circulation but the doctor seems to think it is neurological.Do these symptoms sound like MS?\u00a0\u00a0I have a neurologist appointment next week.\u00a0\u00a0Any advice would be appreciated.",
