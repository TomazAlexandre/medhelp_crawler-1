            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Pain in the upper left abdomen and chest area can be due to stomach issues (GERD or hiatal hernia), spleen issues, due to an abscess below the left diaphragm, a hematoma (localized collection of blood), an abscess, or a muscle pull. Since her ESR and TLC is high, chance of infection is there.An ultrasound or CT scan of abdomen is definitely required. Aortic aneurysm too can present this way. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please get a doctor to examine her. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
