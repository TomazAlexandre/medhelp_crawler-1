            "answer": "If your eating to make yourself feel better its not good, food is meant for nourishing the body and keeping you alive and HEALTHY!!!!By eating excessively to ease whatever it is thats bothering is only going to make things worse. Think about all of the problems you have and all the problems you can add to your life by eating too much and eating unhealthy foods(high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes,etc). Type in google \"what is binge eating\" they say that its a disorder, but I dont think so, I think if you get to the root of the binge eating-whether it be depression due to low self esteem or whatever, or that your in a bad relationship, or have anxiety due to other things...once you get that all figured out everything else could maybe fall into place.By eating because your depressed and not because your hungry is only adding a problem on top of another problem -For Example (someone who has anxiety drinks alcohol to ease their anxiety is only adding another problem to a problem) Figure out whats stressing you and find out how to eliminate those stressors. Hope this helped. BEST WISHES!!!!!",
