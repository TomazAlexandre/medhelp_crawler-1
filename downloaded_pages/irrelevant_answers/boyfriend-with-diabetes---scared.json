            "answer": "Hello, your english is just fine.\u00a0\u00a0If you love your bf, then you have to take the bad with the good.\u00a0\u00a0And you stated your doctor who said \"get ride of him\" must be what we call a shrink?\u00a0\u00a0And if so, he should know better than tell you that,\u00a0\u00a0Maybe you should dump the shrink.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, remember, your bf has to deal with this 24/7 and if sometimes he seems lazy or hard to deal with, it is not because of you but a side effect of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Depression.\u00a0\u00a0All you can do is be there for him, and be very patient with him.\u00a0\u00a0In the back of his mind, he is thinking why would you want to stay in a relationship like yours when he feels he is a such a big pain for you.\u00a0\u00a0So you need to make your stand, if you are really there for the life long relationship, then stand up, and tell him you are, and remind him to check his blood, that if he does not he will only get worse,\u00a0\u00a0And by checking is blood he is doing for the both of you. Insulin pumps are great, expensive but great. My GF has type 1 diabetes, she is also brittle and is hypo and night time unawareness.\u00a0\u00a0I had to bring her out of low events so many times I can't count and if I was not here for her, she would have died.\u00a0\u00a0But isn't that what we do for our loved ones. You can live with it, you just need to learn as much as you can and learn the signs of his highs and lows, know what to do and how to do them.\u00a0\u00a0and enjoy every day.\u00a0\u00a0Hope that helpsSteve",

    "question": "Helloand thanks very much for this forum, it is quite hard for me talk about this topic who really understands me and my feelings. My boyfriend (24) has diabetes type 1 since he is 19yrs old.We have been a couple for about three years and the things are getting quite serious.I love my boyfriend so much, but I am so concerned about him and our future life ...( it makes me cry).I do lots of readings about diabetes, try to push, support, and help him as much as I can.I even told him maybe to consider to use the diabetic pump, which I think is a good thing, but he is not very sure about that. Sorry for my english, I am from Germany.Nevertheless I feel very sad and alone, not being able to help him as much as I can. He has diabetes for almost 5 years now, doesn't suffer from any complications (yet????) but I am afraid that it will come to that. He is being quite lazy with measuring, and I always try to remind him to that, and also to take more of himself. He is just acting sometimes very childish and stubborn, which I do sometimes understand, because it is very tough to live with long life disease.Once a went to my doctor, to inform about juvenile diabetes and I told him that my boyfriend has it. And he got very mean, telling me to get rid of him as fast as I can.. I always start crying when I think of that again..I just don't know what to do. I mean there is a possible way to deal and to live with diabetes, but how can I help my boyfriend to improve his suggar level..Thanks so much!",
