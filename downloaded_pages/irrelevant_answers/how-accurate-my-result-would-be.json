            "answer": "Welcome to the Forum.\u00a0\u00a0I'll try to help, first by discussing your risks and secondly by helping to evaluate your test results.\u00a0\u00a0As far as your risks are concerned, as I understand it, both of your partners were commercial sex workers.\u00a0\u00a0Fortunately, most commercial sex workers, particularly in Bahrain, do not have HIV.\u00a0\u00a0You received oral sex with your first partner, then performed rectal sex with him.\u00a0\u00a0With the second partner your exposure was again rectal intercourse.\u00a0\u00a0In all instances condoms were not used.\u00a0\u00a0 As I said, most commercial sex workers do not have HIV so your risk for HIV is rather low to start with.\u00a0\u00a0There is no risk for HIV form oral sex- no one has ever convincingly described a case in which HIV was transmitted by oral sex.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, rectal intercourse is rather high risk, IF your partner has HIV with the risk for infection being about 1 infection for every 100-200 acts of intercourse.Your test results make it unlikely you got infected.\u00a0\u00a0 The most important results are those form your second set of tests.\u00a0\u00a0At any time more than 4 weeks following exposure, a\u00a0\u00a0negative HIV combo assay like you had, provides definitive evidence that you did not get infected and would detect about 90% of recently acquired infections.\u00a0\u00a0Your PCR and other test results only serve to conform the results of the combo HIV antigen/antibody test that you had.\u00a0\u00a0This it is most unlikely that you acquired HIV from either of these exposures.In the future however, please use condoms.\u00a0\u00a0EWH",

Is the result of this conclude my situation.Thanks again doctor",

    "question": "Good day doctor,I had the following situation and i would really appreciate your prompt response,i had two unprotected exposure and i will describe it franklyFirst exposure was on 8th of june i was drunk and i had a massage on Bahrain (gulf country). The massage guy was a gay phlipino or Thai (i don't exactly know). he invited me to have sex and started to give me oral and then i had penetration (anal) that was very short and as i can remember i ejaculated outside. Last week i passed by the shop and i saw a health certificate (which i thinke by the country rule include HIV tests) and he was fine but that certificate was on 2010 december which is about six month before my contact with him.The second contact was on 28th of june (same month) it was with a Bahraini girl (i met in a bar) that seem to be taking sex as an income (sex worker) as she asked me for money after the sex. She looks that she never carries condom with her (she was not carrying any when i asked her)\u00a0\u00a0and always do the anal sex as i might noticed her backside whole (sorry) and as she claimed that she is still virgin.TWO DAYS AFTER THE SECOND EXPOSURE I HAD GRAIN OR SOMETHING LIKE PILL YOUTH (only one) ON MY PENIS. WHICH THE INFECTUOUS DISEASE DOCTOR SAYS DON'T WARRY ABOUT ITnow i had the following test on the 7th of july 4 weeks after first exposure and 9th day after second exposure:-- Antibody test on the 7th July came back negative.on 11 July 33 days after first exposure and 13 day after second exposure i had the following test:--C-Reactive protein -doctors says it is normal-- hepatitis c antibody - negative--hepatitis b antibody - negative-- syphilis test; qualitative (VDRL, RPR, ART ) NEGATIVE-- combo ag ab hiv - negative-- Qualitative RNA by PCR - negative.what is my situation now and what tests do i need to conclude my situation. i am in a very bad situation i can't sleep and i can't work i am 27 years old.Thanks,",
