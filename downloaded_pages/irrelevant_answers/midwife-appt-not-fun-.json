            "answer": "this month i am gonna go solo(BF has to work) so im thinking if getting a friend to meet me at my appointment as i will have my daughter with me... we havent taken her yet but i want to do some shopping for spring boots and i am not buying any without trying them on! she has such chubby feet... i also think that it would be easier to take her without my BF as he would get stressed faster than me, and stress me out, so fingers crossed someone wants to go with me!! and that she isnt a little holy terror!! lol she is 20 monhts :)",

    "question": "So I went to my midwife appt yesterday. To start off I'm never taking my son with me again!! He is WAY to busy to take with me for this crap. He was all over the place. Climbing things, trying to leave the room...ugh. Made it for a very stressful appointment. Distractions weren't working.I have to go back April 10th to have a follow up ultrasound. Apparently at my 19 week one it showed that my placenta is 2cm away from my cervix. So she's calling it low lying and wants to make sure it moves up. If not then I'll have to be forwarded to an obstetrician. Boo...I'm positive it will move if it hasn't already.Then she did my fundal height which only measured 19 weeks and I'm 23 weeks pregnant. I know it's not too accurate but that's small. On my requisition for my ultrasound it says to check placental placement and fetal growth.Next one should be fun- I get my diabetes test!",
