            "answer": "What type of medications is she on and when will she go back to see the doctor? I think that after 3 months, she should see some relief. There may be something else going on or they may need to try something different.I actually stumbled onto something on the Internet the other day when I was looking up information on Crohns. It said there seems to be a connection with having Crohns and having Diabetes. I can't remember where I saw this because I was popping all over the place but try googling Crohns and Diabetes and see what comes up. I think it's because they're both autoimmune diseases? It's interesting because I was recently diagnosed with Crohns and nobody else in my family has it but I do have a lot of diabetes in my family. I think they still don't know what exactly causes it but you can go to ccfa.org (Crohns and Colitis Foundation of America) and they have a lot of information there.Sorry I couldn't help much. Hopefully someone else with more knowledge than I will see your post. I hope your daughter will start to feel better here pretty soon. God bless.",

            "answer": "I have crohn's. I was diagnosed about 5 years ago.i am 28 now. I am going for a blood test this week becuase my GP thinks that some sypmtoms that i have are not related to the crohns, but may be symptoms of Diabetes and would like to check it out. I stumbled upon this article in googling diabetes and crohns. It seems that they have found a gene that link the 2 together. I too have a history of Diabetes in my family. Here is the linkhttp://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2007060701I just started looking into this. If i find out more, i will come back.",

            "answer": "I have been a type 1 diabetic since age 10--53 years now. Approximately 30 yrs. ago I started having a lot of bloody diarrhea, etc. It took 2 yrs.+ to clear it up and I went for approximately 20 yrs. without any symptoms. When it started up again I was diagnosed with Crohn's and have been on various treatments since then. I have been taking Asacol for years. I have also used enemas--sometimes daily and sometimes twice a day. I had been on Remicade briefly--3 treatments--before going on to Immuran, an immunosuppressant, which worked for about 3 yrs. But, last November I had another flare up. I tried to just deal with it, hoping that it would clear up on it's own because I detest going on steroids--it really screws up my diabetes. Needless to say, it didn't work so I started on the steroids, which cleared up the bloody diarrhea almost immediately. I am no longer on the Immuran, instead I am taking Humira injections every 2 weeks, along with the Asacol and folic acid as well as Prevacid for the acid reflux. (Because I have had to take so many steroids in the past I also have osteoporosis as well.) The Humira seems to be preventing the stomach problems but I have been getting terrible sores in my mouth, which makes it difficult to eat, brush my teeth, etc. Crohn's can affect everything from the rectum to the mouth, but not everybody is affected the same way. It's an autoimmune disease, like diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.I have also read the article maiacita\u00a0\u00a0(above) referred to. It is very interesting. There are a number of articles available by Googling \"Diabetes and Crohn's.\" You can also get more info on Crohn's by going to http://www.ccfa.org/.",
