            "answer": "I read your post and feel for your suffering.\u00a0\u00a0I too have anxiety and panic disorder...I've been taking Klonopin for nearly 20 years and it has helped me a great deal.\u00a0\u00a0I've been taking it on an everyday basis and now my new dr. wants me off it completely.\u00a0\u00a0I am also on Cymbalta which hasn't taken effect yet. Weaning off the Klonopin has been tough and I find that I feel like I can function with it.\u00a0\u00a0So I came to the conclusion that I'd rather be \"addicted\" to this med than to suffer everyday.\u00a0\u00a0I feel that if someone is on insulin for diabetes and they're addicted to it - they still have to take it.\u00a0\u00a0I feel that way about the Klonopin and since you're taking a low dose, I wouldn't worry about using it for the long term esp if you don't have an addictive personality.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

The Klonopin makes me feel normal.",

    "question": "Thanks for taking my question.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have a number of medical problems, such as a benign tumor in my head, SVT's, palpitations, and probably 1 or 2 others I forgot to mention.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I also have really bad depersonalization and panic.\u00a0\u00a0Definately doesn't mix well with SVT's.\u00a0\u00a0What a combonation, eh.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anyways, I've started using a low dose of klonopin only when I leave the house, so I will survive.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise I will dissociate severely\u00a0\u00a0out in the real world and have a major panic attack every time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I've decided at this point it's much better to be addicted to something than to never leave the house.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, how will using klonopin for 2, 5, or 10 years effect me?\u00a0\u00a0 WIll I just have to keep titrating the dose upwards to get the same effects?\u00a0\u00a0 What will happen to me if I use it long term, is it a safe drug other than the addiction factor?\u00a0\u00a0 Does it give anyone's anxiety worse on a permanent basis when they stop taking it?",
