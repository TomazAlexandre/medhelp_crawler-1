    "question": "My fifteen year old daughter had been very tired, gaining weight and her neck looked \"full\" to me so at a routine yearly exam, I asked about testing her thyroid. The pediatrician had the levels checked (she thought her neck seemed full too) and they were mildly low. She called an edocrinologist and he suggested waiting another 3 months and rechecking. Again, they were low and he said to wait another 3 months. At that check (Oct 2007), they were \"normal\". The numbers they gave me were: TSH .65 and T4 (Free) .79When I look on charts, these numbers seem on the low end and I'm not sure whether to pursue things with a specialist or not. The pediatrican seemed to act like the case was closed. My daughter's neck still looks full to me (although she doesn't complain) and she does not seem to be able to lose weight even when she exercises and eats healthily. Any suggestions?",
