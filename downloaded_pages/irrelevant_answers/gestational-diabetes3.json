Its a pain in the butt isn't it!?!\u00a0\u00a0When my blood sugar is high, I drink LOTS of water and walk as much as possible...it seems to bring it down the fastest.Hopefully we'll return to normal once our babies get here!\u00a0\u00a0Every time I want to reach for something with a lot of sugar, I just think about my little boy.\u00a0\u00a0I don't him to be a big baby with breathing problems.kirby-if you do have it, you have to closely watch your diet.\u00a0\u00a0You should meet with a nutritionist if you have it so that he/she can show you what types of foods to eat.Best of luck to you!",

            "answer": "I learned first hand what diabetes can do to a person. My husband has it--which makes me fearful for the kids since we just found out last june 07. He was really bad though, he went to the ER and register over 400 and they gave him insulin and it only dropped to the middle 200 and they wanted him to stay overnight to try to bring it down some more but he's not a good patient and signed himself out. After a couple of months on insulin, nothing and I mean nothing not even a diet kept it down and mind you he lost 35pounds in 1 month from the the drastic change in diet. Then the doctor recommeded \"glimperdine at 4mg each pill\" i believe it's for something else but is know to drop your sugar in a really big way. This is a miracle pill, he able to each anything he wants and all he takes is this pill once a day and it only costs us $4.00 for a months supply. he registers 100 now. Has even gotten so low he had to eat to bring it up.\u00a0\u00a0You probably wont need this cause you seem borderline but pasta, rice, bread, and any starchs will raise your sugar high. it's not only sweet things that do it. I'll get you more info by looking at the book they gave my husband so that you can control it without the aide of medicine.",

Anyway my dr also wants my blood sugar to be between 90-100 fasting right now it is 102 which isn't bad and she wants it to be below 125 2 hours after i eat which isn't going so good because it higher then that infact the last time i checked it was 148 and i am doing the diet staying away from carbs and sweets and everything she is gonna give me a week to try and see if i can control it with diet and if not she will have to prescribe a pill i took a pill with my son and with my daughter i could control it with diet hope i can do the same",
