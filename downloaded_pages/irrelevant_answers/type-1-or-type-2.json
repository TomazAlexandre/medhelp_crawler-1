            "answer": "Type 1 diabetics pancreases produce no insulin so they need real injectedinsulin.Type 2 diabetics pancreases either don't produce enough insulin ortoo much insulin resistance is present for the insulin to be efficiently utilized-a variety of meds are available for type 2's.Specific testing isrequired to determine type of diabetes.Hopefully this was done correctly 17 years ago but you might want to discuss this with doctor.Eddie",
