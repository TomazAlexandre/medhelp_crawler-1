    "question": "Hi there,I am 39y/o female who needs to lose about 60lbs.\u00a0\u00a0Almost all of it is in my abdominal area and breasts.\u00a0\u00a0I gained this weight after 6 months on bedrest during my pregnancy, with most of it gained in the last 3 months of the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't lost any. I eat healthy (about 1500cals/day).\u00a0\u00a0I eat fresh produce, lean meat, egg whites, lentils for protein. NO sugar (don't really crave sweets) and avoid transfatty acids.\u00a0\u00a0I power walk 45 - 60min, 4-5x week, plus calesthenics.\u00a0\u00a0I can't do weight lifting exercises since I have a long history of benign PVC's, and they make the PVC's worse.Other symptoms I have are muscle spasmsMy chiropractor says I have muscle knots everywhere.\u00a0\u00a0I also take Klonopin for the PVC's when they are bad.2 wks ago, I had a Kenalog shot for allergies.\u00a0\u00a0I have had them before(more than 10yrs ago). It helped the allergies, but I am one week late for my period (and I'm never late! - also not pregnant). I don't even know if it will come.\u00a0\u00a0I also had a bad headache the night of the injection. I also feel fatter, my pants slightly tighter around my waist.I also had steroid shots when I was pregnant (3.3 yrs ago)for baby's lungs.\u00a0\u00a0They made me tense and complete insomniac for several nites.\u00a0\u00a0I also had a steroid shot in each of my feet for neuroma 1.5yrs ago.In the last three years, my dr. has checked my thyroid repeatedly.\u00a0\u00a0It is always normal, not even low normal.\u00a0\u00a0He also did another test for cortisol, where I had to take a low dose steroid pill and have a blood test the next morning.\u00a0\u00a0That was normal too.\u00a0\u00a0My gyno did a group of blood tests for insulin resistance, but that was normal.\u00a0\u00a0My glucose is great.\u00a0\u00a0I do have mild sleep apnea, but I have been on CPAP for several months, and feel energetic.\u00a0\u00a0He is at a loss at this point- wanted to send me to endocrinologist, but HMO won't go for it without a dx.",
