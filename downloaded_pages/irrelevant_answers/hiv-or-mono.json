            "answer": "Thanks, Morty92I'm a step ahead of you.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't want to wait for the appointment next month so I administered one of those mail in home access test for HIV-1 on myself a two days ago.\u00a0\u00a0I received my results today over the phone.\u00a0\u00a0I tested negative for HIV-1, which is a relief to say the least.\u00a0\u00a0However, I had a mono spot test that was negative, but a couple days later tested positive for mono after a more reliable test. As such, I definitely will be retaking the HIV test with my doctor.One thing I have failed to mention above was that my protein studies come back with low Igm levels.\u00a0\u00a0Not sure what the significance is with that but anything other than normal can't be good.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your comments.",

    "question": "37 year old male. For about 13 years I've been experiencing occurrences of alopecia areata with one to two patches of hair loss per year respectfully and my fingernails have also been affected in that they have been dull with ridges over that same period of time.In December of 2009, the hair loss occurred along with symptoms of shortness of breath, bloating, vomiting, night sweats, mild-moderate fever, shaking chills, painful bloodshot eyes with tint of gray/yellow in the corners, eye twitching, neck stiffness and pain, abdominal pain and swelling, muscle cramps, weight loss, and bad reactions to antibiotics.\u00a0\u00a0Took amoxicillin on two occasions prior to oral surgery for implants and ended up in the ER with fever, profuse sweating, weakness, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration, no rash.\u00a0\u00a0I've never had reactions to amoxicillin in the past.\u00a0\u00a0In February, I went to an allergist to rule out any allergies. The blood work he had performed revealed elevated liver enzymes.\u00a0\u00a0He tested me for the obvious stuff and referred me to a gastroenterologist/hepatologist that ran some tests and said that this was out of his area of expertise so he referred me to an internal medicine doctor.For the past several months I've been chronically ill and was tested for everything under the sun including tetanus, TB, diphtheria, hepatitis A,B,C, liver disease, fatty liver, lupus, celiac disease, hemochromatosis, Wilsons disease, thyroid problems, diabetes and Lyme disease to state a few.\u00a0\u00a0All have come back negative. Had ultrasound of gallbladder and was negative for stones, and had CT of abdomen and pelvis and that came back negative for cirrhosis, fatty liver, however, doctor states traces of autoimmune hepatitis.After a recent 21 day fever (April-May), I tested positive and was finally diagnosed with Infectious mononucleosis (IM), however, my doctor wants to test me for HIV.\u00a0\u00a0In the past, I've been tested for HIV 4 times (1996, 97, 98 and 99) while serving in the military and the results were all negative.\u00a0\u00a0And as history serves me right, the last time I put myself at risk was in April of 1997.\u00a0\u00a0So, my risk should be low, however, I have spent the last three and half years having a lot of dental work including having baby teeth pulled, braces put on, and two surgical implants as well check-ups and cleanings.In any event, my doctor has suspicions that I may be infected with HIV.\u00a0\u00a0Over the course of the last several months (December to present), I\u2019ve had blood work done at least a dozen times which consistently reveals elevated liver enzymes with my ALT ranging from 56-188, AST normal - 88, GGT 78 (tested once for GGT), slightly elevated WBC ranging from 8.4-14, Neutrophils normal to elevated, consistent low bun scores 5 or 6, platelet count normal to elevated, cholesterol results normal(199) to high(245), LDL high, HDL high(except once read low), TRG normal, Glucose normal, urinalysis showed protein in urine at 10, electrolytes normal, PSA .8 normal, TSH 1.54, Free T4 1.1, Free T3 3.2.\u00a0\u00a0All other blood work has been normal or negative.My doctor (internal medicine) has suspicions of HIV because my liver enzymes have been fluctuating in the elevated ranges, coming down a bit but then jumping back up.\u00a0\u00a0She is referring me back to my gastroenterologist doctor and has made an appointment for me to see an infectious disease doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I would like a second opinion.",
