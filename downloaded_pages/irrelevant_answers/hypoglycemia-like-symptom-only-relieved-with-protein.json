            "answer": "Yes usually with hypoclycemia protein and complex carbohydrates like whole grains and also legumes, works better than sugar because it takes longer to break it down so it stays in your system longer. This prevents the spikes (low and high) from occurring. The symptoms you are feeling are all signs of low blood sugar. Have you been tested? If not you should get a fasting blood sugar or a hemoglobin A1C.\u00a0\u00a0Some people just need to eat more often and less big of a meal such as a protein snack and may not have true hypoglycemia. You should get it checked to be sure.",

            "answer": "My fasting glucose is normal. Though I have never had it tested while I was feeling the way described. It can happen if I go a couple of hours without breakfast though, or less. To clarify, when I said glucose didn't work very well,\u00a0\u00a0I was talking about the inmediate - short while effect too. Then would it mean It raised blood sugar too much? Too little? Starch is generally not very good also, unless it has high protein like potatoes.",

            "answer": "If your fasting blood sugar is okay you probably just get on the low side and start to feel gittery and irritable. I am like that too. So, yes protein and the complex carbs both work. Just eat either one more often and have smaller meals or have a snack with you so when you feel like that you can boost yourself up. I personally feel better now that I'm on a vegan diet. I eat a whole plant based diet with complex carbs and veggies and vanilla soy milk. I don't get as gittery. I don't crave sweets either. It is weird. So, they say to eat very small meals that contain protein 6 times a day or have 3 meals with snacks that have protein or complex carbs.mkh9",

    "question": "I often feel weak, mind-foggy and irritable if I go too long without food. I normally have to eat some protein along with a carbohydrate to feel good, otherwise the problem continues or worsens. I have tried eating pure glucose, and it only partially helps (with physical energy), leaving me mentally-foggy and with a strong craving for protein; so it seems it is not just hypoglycemia, and just eating sugar won't fix it. What is this?",
