            "answer": "You need to see your doctor and perhaps ask for a referral to a diabetic educator. You also need to check out your meter because I highly doubt his blood sugar was 15 and he was functioning well enough to calmly eat cereal. If his blood sugar had been low, cereal is not the proper treatment as it will not raise glucose quickly enough. Glucose tablets are much more accurate and rapid. He needs to learn more about managing his blood sugar.",
