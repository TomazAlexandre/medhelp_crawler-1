I am over weight already, (like 50 lbs,) and I have heart disease, diabetes, and cancer risk in my family so I am trying to get serious about losing weight. :(Maybe if I keep up with my exercise it will help a little. I hope. Good to know it is good with moods, though.",

            "answer": "I was on Resperidone for a little less than a year. It made me sleepy for the beginning but that went away. The reason I went off it is because of the weight gain, I was underweight at the beginning, by the end I was almost 80lbs overweight.I didn't really like it though, I had a problem drooling, I felt like a zombie for a good long time.Maybe it's because I wasn't diagnosed bipolar (they had diagnosed me as schizophrenic for a bit) at the time and it was the only medication I was on, but I don't think it helped me too much, it brought me down from my manic episode, but then I just kept going down instead of leveling out and being stable.",

            "answer": "I don't like all this talk about weight gain. As I said I am already 50 lbs over weight. It is very hard on my self esteem, which only adds to my depression. My weight problem is one of my triggers, (both ways,) when I am feeling bad about myself. I have been proud of myself recently I've been losing about 1 llb a week.I am supposed to take a low dose, I think 1 mg. I am actaully pretty scared of meds.",

I went pre diabetic on Risperdone and really gained weight. Abilify, seraquel, geodon, invega,and risperdone all can make you go diabetic so I don't know if it is a good idea for you as you are already diabetic.",

I wouldn't be surprised if any of my cousins have diabetes. My dad's father died of heart disease at a young age. (I never knew him.) On my mom's side it is cancer. Breast cancer, bone cancer, and lieukemia.I am over weight after my kids were born, and never lost the baby weight. I work in a diabetes education center, but I don't actually have it myself. I've been trying to be healthier because I know the risks and that is why I dont' want to gain more weight. I can't afford to have diabetes and bipolar, too. :(Oh and thanks so much everyone. I know I ask a lot of questionos. >.>",

    "question": "So since I am allergic to Lamictal my doctor is deciding to try Risperidone. He thinks it will also help me with my paranoia and repetitive thoughts. However, being an anti-psychotic I'm scared. I read through the side effects, some of them are pretty crazy, I know a lot of the bad ones are rare, but so far I'm 1:1 for bad rare side effects. >.>Well, I'm also nervous being on an anti-psychotic because in 2006 a psychiatrist at the hospital where my son was born put me on an anti-psychotic. I don't remember the name of it. Well, it gave me panic attacks like you wouldn't believe. I was either jittery or my whole body would just freeze up and I can't even explain the intensity or how it felt. I felt like my whole body was turning against me. Well, I sent a HIPAA release form to my old OB to get the name of that med. I don't want to fill this until I'm sure it was a different one.Anyway, anyone have any thoughts on Risperidone? Do you think it helps you or not so much? My doctor says it makes you sleepy. Does that get better with time? I don't want to be a zombie. I know we all react different to meds, but any thoughts on it would be great.",
