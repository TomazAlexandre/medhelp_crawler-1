            "answer": "Avoid processed foods like white breads, candy, and juices. Eat whole grains like brown rice, whole grain bread products and beans or legumes. Eat fruit and vegetables (better to have fresh or frozen). If you need a sweetener for tea or desserts or something, i would use agave nectar as it has a low glycemic index meaning it will prevent your blood sugar from drastic changes.
