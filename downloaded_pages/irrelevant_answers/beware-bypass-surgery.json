            "answer": "What you say is true.\u00a0\u00a0The COURAGE study that did a study on the benefit and life span by of heart patients with ischemia and comparing results with just medication, stent implant and bypass.\u00a0\u00a0Results indicate life span is not increased with a bypass. If one cannot tolerate medication and there is no relief from ischemic pain, then intervention would be an option.Also harvesting an artery from the leg can be problematic as that vein may not be without some plaque formation, etc.\u00a0\u00a0The mammary vessel provides better results.I'm going on 4 years with medication, exercise, diet, etc. and doing quite.\u00a0\u00a0I had a silent heart attack (MI) and then congested heart failure.\u00a0\u00a0My EF was too low for a surgical procedure.\u00a0\u00a0I had triple occlusion.\u00a0\u00a0The LAD was/is completely blocked, but collateral vessels provide a natural bypass.\u00a0\u00a0The RCA was 98% and a stent was implanted to help provide more blood to the distal portion of the heart.\u00a0\u00a0ICX is/was 72% blocked and no intervention.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry to hear of your experience.",

            "answer": "....but by having bypass, the opportunity for natural the body to naturally bypass blockages is removed...so again, avoid that bypass surgery at all costs unless you are dying and you aren;t going to see morning ....and no, don;t believe your cardio and his fear mongering protocol...talk to other people...there are ways out...",

    "question": "If you are not dead or you are not about to die, DO NOT simply succumb to your cardio's demands that you are going ot drop dead if you don;t have bypass...I went through all this **** last summer, had a triple bypass becvause of a left main blockage, 48 years old, fit, good diet, tons of exercise, but got slammed because of 40 years of type 1 diabetes....but, I didn;t need to have that bypass; I could have alleviated the conditoon throuogh alternate therapies and over time, would have avoided the ten year life span this surgery has given me....not to mention the absolute and nasty change in my personality, the constant nagging pain in my chest, etcetc...SO DON'T DO IT!! until you;vechecked every possible alternative...bypass treats the symptom, not the disease....don't succumb to some numb skull's protocol.....",
