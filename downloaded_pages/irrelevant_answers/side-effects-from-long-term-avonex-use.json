            "answer": "I have been on Avonex since the fall of 2009 to treat my MS. My symptom of fatigue is troubling and my heart vs my head attributes this to my medication more than the illness. Is this correct? Will the fatigue subsist with time?",

    "question": "Have there been any studies published as to the possible long term effects of Avonex use?I am a 10 yr + user of Avonex and am becoming concerned.My healing time from minor cuts etc seems to be exceedingly long. I recently under went dental surgery and my dentist commented on my slow healing.I am at an age where major surgery occurs and fractures also some times and I am afraid that I would be debileated long term or worse if this was to occur.Any info would be greatly appreciated. Thanks\u00a0\u00a0Mike G.",
