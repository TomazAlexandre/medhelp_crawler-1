    "question": "between the timing of the exposure, i was convinced that i was showing symptoms of acute hiv infection. Fatigue, loss of appitite, swollen groin and throat, and dry mouth. Whenever i would try and look up symptoms online, it all pointed to either HIV or lymphoma. Well, after testing and coming back negative, my symptoms still had me scared. After repeated visits to the doctor, they finally found out that i had out of control candidia or thrush. brought on by a combination of my diabetes and being on antibiotics.If you are worried about exposure, get tested. and dont go self diagnosing!",
