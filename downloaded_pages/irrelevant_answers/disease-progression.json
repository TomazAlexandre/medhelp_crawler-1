            "answer": "1.9? Then you are in 3rd stage kidney disease. There are 5 stages. It would depend on how fast the progression of your disease is to know when what will happen but as far as dialysis there are the options of Peritoneal Dialysis (which uses Dextrose and requires good eye sight to do it for yourself at home) or Hemo Dialysis where you would go in center 3 times a week and they would do dialysis on you through a perm catheter in the clavical area or through an AV Fistula which would be made in your arm but would need time to form.Stage 3 you could have 20 years before you would need dialysis .. or less .. Before kidneys fail completely it is wise to limit protein as with the kidneys going through stages of kidney failure protein is hard on it. Limiting Protein can make your kidneys last longer.Do you see a Nephrologist yet or just\u00a0\u00a0Urologist?",

            "answer": "Hi. I am a 72 year old that found out 10 years ago that my kidneys were in trouble due to hypertension damage. 14 months ago I recieved a live doner kidney (wife). Up to 2 years ago every one talked about dialysis. We moved to southern Ga. and my miracle nephrologist said I was in final stages (4) of failure but that I was in such great physical shape that I should go the transplant way and START IMMEDIATELY. He put me on the National list but my wife tested perfect and now all my numbers are in line, I feel wonderful!! I have type 2 diabetes controled by diet. Best of luck. See if you qualify for the doner list.",
