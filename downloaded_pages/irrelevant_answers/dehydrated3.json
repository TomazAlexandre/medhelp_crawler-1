            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!There is a possibility that you have Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. Diabetes insipidus is another possibility that can result in water loss from the body. Too many energy drinks rich in calcium can also result in multiple calcium stones and calcification. It can also be due to metastaitic calcification in the body due to cancer.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
