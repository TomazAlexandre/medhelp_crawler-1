            "answer": "Hi!Yes, where lab values are concerned there are several such grey zones. This is because there can be lab variations depending on your gender and ethnicity. Also the ranges differ from lab to lab. Hence, at times, the doctors depend on their clinical experience and results of clinical examination.Generalized dryness in different parts of the body can be due to Sjogren\u2019s. However, it can also be due to Vitamin A deficiency, hypothyroidism, and diabetes. So check out and see if you suffer from any of these. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "Thanks, Dr!\u00a0\u00a0No diabetes, and no vitamin A deficiency...but if it could possibly be hypothyroidism, then maybe is related to the Hashimoto's. I guess the endocrinologist will check that next week.",

    "question": "After seeing numerous specialists because my rheumatologist felt there was more than just fibromyalgia going on, I am \"relieved\" to know I have Hashimoto's thyroiditis and am awaiting results of a lip biopsy to confirm sjogren's...the antibody tests for it had come back negative but after my ophthamologist found evidence of severe dry eye and corneal damage to my right eye, and my GI doc found evidence of lack of mucosal lining in esophagus and esophagitis (could just be GERD but also mouth sores and some saliva test showed lack of saliva, too), plus vaginal dryness & abnormal pap with no other explanation, my rheumatologist decided I had enough signs/damage that he thinks i could be one of the 10-15% who don't have the antibodies.What fascinates me is how many of my labs have been normal, but RIGHT at the cut-offs that are used, such as sed rate.\u00a0\u00a0Makes me wonder, if they are ranges, and if some patients don't test positive but have all the symptoms, and others test positive without symptoms, might it make sense sometimes to find the best fit diagnosis and treat that?\u00a0\u00a0I guess not, b/c then I might be getting treatment for MS instead of Hashimoto's...even though I tried telling them i didn't have MS but wanted my thyroid checked.\u00a0\u00a0Such a frustrating road!",
