On appeal he wrote a letter about the possible incompatance on the person or people reviewing his claim. He was then approved and back paid from Mar 2000. This process takes quite a long time. If you can afford an attorney, i would go that route.Good luck in this process.Elizabeth",

I filed June 5th so I should be getting something in September---PROBABLY!\u00a0\u00a0Also, I will be hiring an attorney on a contingency basis. They have a ceiling on the amount SSD will allow them to take from your settlement--PROVIDING YOU GET IT! I think it about 25%-35%. I am not to the stage of hiring one. I was told by a friend to just wait until you get turned down the first time before hiring one. One question you want to ask the attorney though is if he has ever won a HEP C case and/or combind with cirrhosis and maybe diabetes like I have. I understand it is not uncommon for g type1 people that had Hep C for 20 years or more to have advanced cirrhosis and maybe even diabetes.",

When you are asked if you or able to do house work, yardwork ,etc do not say \"maybe at times I can depending on how I feel\". You answer it no and tell them why. Even if some of the problems don't happen every day write it down. You want be lying because you don't know when something's going to happen. Get all your medical record together yourself and send to them that save's time. Let all your Dr's know what you are doing.Because they will be contacted.I'm not sure if it makes a differents what State you live in are not.I'm in Florida, I got ss disability but no state assistance like medicaid because my husband worked.
