    "question": "I was looking for some information on eye floaters I experience.\u00a0\u00a0I had some stomach bleeding with anemia and transfusions about 6 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0Several weeks later, I started seeing floaters.\u00a0\u00a0They are mostly small, dark circles or look like uncolorful cobwebs.\u00a0\u00a0I usually only see floaters in bright light such as a sunny day or under office lighting.After I started experiencing floaters, I saw my ophthalmologist, who dilated my eyes and examined me, but found nothing wrong.\u00a0\u00a0My primary care doctor also did blood work to check for diabetes, but that was negative.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 30 year old white male.\u00a0\u00a0I take small amounts of Clonazepam at night for an anxiety disorder, as well as Protonix and Hemocyte Plus during the day.\u00a0\u00a0My primary doctor advised me to try stopping the Hemocyte, which I did for about 10 days with no noticeable changes in the floaters.\u00a0\u00a0I do moderate exercise 5-6 times a week (jogging, weight lifting, hiking).My hemoglobin is now normal, but I continue to see floaters.\u00a0\u00a0My ferritin levels were still low at last check (11).\u00a0\u00a0I have not seen flashing lights.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a few mild aches around my eyes, but no migraines.I also experience some tingly feelings in my right cheek.\u00a0\u00a0I have been examined by two dentists who found nothing wrong.\u00a0\u00a0I have also had a head CT scan, which was negative.I was wondering how long I should expect to experience these floaters?\u00a0\u00a0Why are they happening?\u00a0\u00a0Is there anything I can do (besides avoiding bright lights), to improve them?\u00a0\u00a0Are there any activities I should avoid?\u00a0\u00a0Should I get reexamined by an eye doctor?\u00a0\u00a0Should I see neurological specialist?",
