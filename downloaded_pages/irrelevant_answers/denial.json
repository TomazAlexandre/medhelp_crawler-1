            "answer": "I am a type 2 diabetic, I take Metformine 500mg daily, I lost my weight and I exercize, now my BS's run great. There is a long history of diabetus in my family, but I decided I could live with it and I am. I maintain my weight now at 118, I try to exercize at least twice a week. I do carry a candy bar in my purse at all times. If you cut out most of the stress in your daily life you will find it is easy to carry on like any \"normal\" person.
