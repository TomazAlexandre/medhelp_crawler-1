At the stage you are in baby will be perfectly fine. Am just 34 weeks and my blood pressure was the same as yours this morning. I think because you are that far along they may just have you deliver. Am getting induced on the 30th of Dec at 37 weeks.",

            "answer": "36 weeks was full term for the longest time before they changed it to 37 which is now considered full term. Since your baby is considered or will be by the time they would induce they will probably go ahead and do so. It is doubtful if they can not see it stabilize that they would risk the health of you and baby when they can deliver a healthy term baby soon. 36 weeks is not too early for a medical induction where you and baby can be monitored from the start and lots of women deliver naturally by that time. Good luck and hope things go well for you.",
