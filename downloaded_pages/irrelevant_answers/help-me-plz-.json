            "answer": "I say when it's time your baby will come. Why does he want to rush it? Pregnancy is meant to last 40 weeks. I wouldn't let him force you into anything you don't want to do. Your body will know when it's time. I don't believe in inducing unless something is wrong. Be stern with him. It's you body and baby. Best wishes!",

            "answer": "It's probably just a typo or I'm reading it wrong but if your 37 weeks and 18 days that would make you 39 weeks and 4 days. But your doctor still shouldn't be trying to push you to do anything as long as there are no complications. Your baby will come when they're ready.",

            "answer": "With gestational diabetes they usually want you to deliver a little early, there is a higher risk of problems for baby if they come later past 40 weeks. Im surprised your baby is so small, GD babies are usually on the bigger side. I'd ask your doc for details on why, but I'm going to guess thats the reason.",

            "answer": "Maybe baby isn't growing anymore which suggests your placenta isn't functioning great or there are potential problems. 5.3lbs is small and that may be the reason.Babies who come >37 weeks do just as well.\u00a0\u00a0There's a higher risk of still birth >40 weeks especially if you're over 35years old.Talk to your doctor again as there should be a medical reason (and from what you've said so far it sounds like there might be.)",

            "answer": "Not quite clear how far along u are from ur first post but having gestational diabetes as the previous poster mentioned places baby at higher risk and if he already told u baby can't grow any more it sounds like there are clear reasons why he suggested u deliver early... To give the baby the best chances health wise.. I get that u may be scared but I would explain your feelings to the doctor so he can explain fully yo u",
