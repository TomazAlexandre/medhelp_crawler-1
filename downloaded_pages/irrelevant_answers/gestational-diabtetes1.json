            "answer": "Everyone is different. I didn't fast for my 1 hour and the test was high. Fasted for my 3 hour and tests were still high now I check my levels 4 times a day and am on a special diet. But with my first baby I had no problems. Most women who fail the first test are fine after the 3 hour it's just a weeding out process and if you have a family history of diabetes and/or GD you run a higher risk for it too. For me, unfortunately basically everyone in my family is diabetic so I'm super predisposed for it lol either way, good luck and don't stress!!",
