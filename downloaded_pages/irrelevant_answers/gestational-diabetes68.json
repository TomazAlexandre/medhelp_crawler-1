            "answer": "If you aren't happy you should yes. But I think the bmi chart is bogus. Is unrealistic. Sure I could stand to lose a little weight but I'm tall and active and that just is a number cruncher but doesn't take into count muscle or anything like that just a height to weight radio. So that being said I gained 43lbs with my daughter and carried her to a day she of 42 weeks. I think as long as you are not eating a lot if sugar foods and staying somewhat active as active as we can be in pregnancy and eating a well balanced diet you will be fine. I honestly don't think your weight gain is unrealistic. Most drs will say a pound per week is fine.",

            "answer": "You should try to cut out fruit juice, it has so many sugars, but sugar is not the only thing you have to watch out for with gestational diabetes. I'm 8weeks and 3 days (found out I wasn't as far along on 2-12/14 and that I also have gestational diabetes) it can be a very scary thing, because from what I understand if I don't keep my sugar levels in li e it can cause complications for my baby while growing :(... Its super scary and I have another doc appt on the 19th and will also be recommended to see a nutritionist to help me find a healthy food plan for both me and baby. I researched it some on my own and got helpful suggestions, I'm also keeping a food diary so that way I can talk to my doctor about what may or may not work for me. I have a family of 4 I also cook for, so this means a change in eating habbits for us all. But I'm gonna try my best and make sure I'm giving my baby a healthy start.\u00a0\u00a0I hope the best for you and your baby, and ask tons of questions!!! It never hurts to be informed :)",

I dont have gd but she keeps warning me of the issues related bc my bmi was higher before I got pregnant. Im 31wks now and have gained 30lbs. Many people have said thats normal but this midwife isnt very reassuring. Any thoughts? (Im inquiring about changing mw, for other reasons as well.)",
