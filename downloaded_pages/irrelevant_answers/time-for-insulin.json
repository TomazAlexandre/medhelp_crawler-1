            "answer": "HIYou are correct with those BG numbers you will get to complications sooner rather than later.To start your Metforman is very low you can go up to 2250 a day on metforman.You dont say what \"diet\" you should be on.We know that carbohydrates are what raise BG,\u00a0\u00a0using insulin\u00a0\u00a0to cover excess carbs will add weight.I am on insulin and eat under 80gr of carbs a day.carbs raise BGcarbs require insulin.insulin is not an easy fix\u00a0\u00a0 done rite (for good control) you are talking a minimum of 4 shots a day.to use insulin you have to count carbs and inject for the carbs eatin take to much insulin and you go low, not enough insulin you go high.insulin done wrong can do more damageI think insulin done rite more work than eating rite.JMO",

            "answer": "I use insulin.I use Humalin-N as my basal (this is an older insulin), and Humalog as my bolus.Combined with low carb eating, insulin can be an excellent tool.\u00a0\u00a0And best of all, It always works.It does need to be used by an educated patient, so that you know it's effects, durations of action etc.\u00a0\u00a0And you need to test enough to make sure you avoid lows.Seeing you already eat low carb, I would recommend Dr. Richard Bernstein's book \"Diabetes solutions\".\u00a0\u00a0It is excellent in teaching how to use insulin and particularly in combination with low carb diet.",

            "answer": "Hey Scrappy - has your doctor suggested adding GLIMEPIRIDE\u00a0\u00a0to your Metformin?\u00a0\u00a0I am type 2, have been for 10 years - also only have 1/2 a Pancreas, as I had to have the other half removed due to a tumor in the head of my Pancreas - 8 hour surgery, and 8 days in the hospital, which is where the Insulin shots started.\u00a0\u00a0Initially,\u00a0\u00a0I came home from the hospital on both types of Insulin.\u00a0\u00a0I was doing well enough after 6 months to be taken off the Insulin, and the Dr added the Glimepiride to the Met.\u00a0\u00a0It controlled my sugar fairly well - A1C was never higher than 7.1, and is currently 6.8 - which the Dr is thrilled at for me only having half a pancreas... I still have highs (300) and lows (49), but overall not bad.\u00a0\u00a0If I were you, I would TRY ALL avenues with oral meds before making the decision with your Dr. to start Insulin shots.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have a problem with needles either, but I gotta tell ya, the shots get old after a while.\u00a0\u00a0If you really need the Insulin, talk to your Dr bout which Pen would work best for you - it's much much easier than regular needles!!\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck....",

    "question": "I am having trouble keeping my blood sugar in control.\u00a0\u00a0I will confess that I have not been dilligent with my diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0My latest A1c was 7.3.\u00a0\u00a0I am taking 850 mg of Metformin twice a day.\u00a0\u00a0My morning blood sugar is around 200.\u00a0\u00a0I am close to or over 200 for most of the day as well.I have decided that until I can lose weight and get my numbers in control that way that insulin might be a good choice for me.\u00a0\u00a0I am afraid that it constantly being that high is going to cause damage.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried other medications such as Actos and Januvia but they did not make that big a difference.\u00a0\u00a0I tried the Byetta as well with the same results.\u00a0\u00a0So I am not afraid of needles or injections.My question would be which insulin pens would be my best choice?\u00a0\u00a0I think a long acting such as Lantus and I might need a rapid acting one for meals?\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to see the nurse practioner today in my doctor's office.I also am a member on the Thyroid boards with having Hashimoto's disease as well.Thanks in advance for your help.",
