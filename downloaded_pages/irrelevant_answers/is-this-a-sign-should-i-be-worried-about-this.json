            "answer": "Hi LilShortie,I'm not a doctor so I can't give you a diagnosis. However, as I recall you had posted a question earlier where you explained some of the symptoms you were having and wondered if it could be diabetes. What you are experiencing could be related to many different conditions, one of which could be circulation problems, but not necessarily due to diabetes. Please see your doctor as soon as you can and discuss all your symptoms and concerns with him. Good luck to you!",

            "answer": "Your symptoms could be signs of any number of health issues, and I totally agree that you should call your doctor and discuss them. Swelling in the feet and legs can be signs of some fairly serious problems, or maybe something as simple as just standing too long without moving. Your doctor can tell do the proper tests to find out the source of the problem. If the problems are getting worse, you should not delay, for almost any health problem can be corrected if caught early.",
