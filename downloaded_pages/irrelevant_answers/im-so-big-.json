I don't have high blood pressure or diabetes, but she only wanted me to gain 20 lbs in my entire pregancy. So far I've gained 22 and I'm barely 36+1, to which she is not too happy about. If your doc is not showing concern you should still try and limit yourself a bit because too much weight gain can bring complications and it can also bring gestational diabetes! God bless you and Best of luck!",

I gained 90 pounds during my pregnancy I'm now 4 months postpartum and have 20 pounds left to loose until I'm my prepregnancy weight. I did develop preeclempsia but that's because I had a very large baby she's in the 97th percentile right now for height and weight she's wearing 9-12 month clothes at almost 4 months lol. And yes I am exclusively breastfeeding",
