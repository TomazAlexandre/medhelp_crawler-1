            "answer": "First, a urinalysis is a pretty good test for a urinary tract infection, so you should trust your doctor's diagnosis if that's what s/he found.\u00a0\u00a0However, some STDs can mimic UTI, and many docs don't test for STDs unless the patient tells a full and complete story so the doc knows the risks.\u00a0\u00a0Were you tested for STDs?Second, increased vaginal odor is the most common symptom of bacterial vaginosis (BV) or trichomoniasis.\u00a0\u00a0BV is related to sexual activity, but isn't an STD in the usual sense; trich is a garden-variety STD, i.e. acquired from a partner.\u00a0\u00a0Although BV or trich shouldn't be confused with UTI, it is possible.Third, your sexual history includes good and bad news about STD risk.\u00a0\u00a0The good news is that you haven't had unprotected sex.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, this depends on what you mean by \"unprotected\":\u00a0\u00a0if you mean correct use of a condom every time, that's great.\u00a0\u00a0The bad news is the history of \"concurrency\"--i.e., having 2 or more partners, at least one of which reflects a (presumably) non-committed partner who might have other partners.\u00a0\u00a0(I can't make presumptions here--you know better than I can whether either your ongoing or new partner is likely to have had other partners.)Fourth, you don't say how old you are.\u00a0\u00a0Statistically speaking, your STD risk is much higher if you and your partners are in your 20s than if you are, say, over 40.\u00a0\u00a0Not zero if older, but a lot lower.Finally, unrelated to all the above:\u00a0\u00a0Are you sure about \"sugar\" in the urine?\u00a0\u00a0That means diabetes, which can predispose to yeast infections and to UTI.\u00a0\u00a0Are you known to be a diabetic?\u00a0\u00a0If not, please make sure you check this out further with your doctor.Bottom line on the STD risk:\u00a0\u00a0Make sure your doctor checked for the common STDs and BV.\u00a0\u00a0If so and if s/he says the UTI is definite, then you're probably home free from an STD perspective.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure and recheck the \"sugar\" business.Good luck--\u00a0\u00a0HHH, MD",

            "answer": "No, my doctor did not test for any std's.\u00a0\u00a0I've never been through any of this so I didn't know what to expect or to ask of her.\u00a0\u00a0I told her all of my symptoms and all that she made me do is give her an urine sample.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, I am sure that she said that there was sugar in my urine, but she didn't seem that concerned at this point.\u00a0\u00a0She said that the \"ph\"in my urine tested a 5 and she said that is low.\u00a0\u00a0She also asked me if I had a job that I sat all day long.\u00a0\u00a0I do, I sit 10 hours a day.\u00a0\u00a0She seemed to think all of this were reasons why I was having my symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if any of this matters, I am just trying to let you know what she has said.2nd...I always had protected sex with condoms.\u00a0\u00a0No Exceptions!3rd...I am 23 years old so I guess I am more at risk.Thanks for responding quickly.",

            "answer": "It is not my habit or intent to criticize a doctor's practice and/or knowledge, because there always is another side of the story and I have only heard yours.\u00a0\u00a0But sitting all day is entirely irrelevant.\u00a0\u00a0A sexual history should be routine in providing primary care for any 23-year-old woman; many docs skip it, but not many would fail to take a sexual history or to talk about STD risks in a patient with vaginal odor or other genital symptoms.Finally, putting off a pelvic after giving an antibiotic risks missing any STD that might have been present; if you happened to have chlamydia or gonorrhea, for example, the antibiotic for your (urinary tract?) infection might suppress it so the test will be negative.\u00a0\u00a0But looking for a silver lining, maybe she sent a urine specimen for gonorrhea and chlamydia testing.\u00a0\u00a0If so, it would remove my concern about the delayed pelvic exam and give me more hope that your doctor is more aware of STD issues than I implied above.A urine pH of 5 is normal; on the low side of normal, but not unusual.Follow-up on the sugar in the urine; even if it goes away, even a single test showing sugar in the urine indicates a need for more tests to check the diabetes possibility.HHH, MD",

    "question": "Hello,Let me tell you a little about my situation.\u00a0\u00a0I have been with someone for about 4 years.\u00a0\u00a0Then about a year ago, I met someone else and began sleeping with him.I haven't had sex with #2 since August and am not seeing him anymore.\u00a0\u00a0I have continued to have sex with my spouse.I am afraid that I have contacted something.\u00a0\u00a0Let me say though, I had and have protected sex in fear of pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I have never had unprotected sex.I've never had any burning or discomfort during unrination or sex.\u00a0\u00a0I don't carry a fever and don't bleed in between periods. I don't have any burning or itching. I do have however a different sent and discharge, more than normal.\u00a0\u00a0My \"smell\" isn't horrible, it's just different that what I am of custom to. Let me also say that I have a very weak bladder.\u00a0\u00a0I went to see my Doctor, hoping that I have some type of Bladder infection.\u00a0\u00a0She tested my urine to find I have blood and sugar in my urine.\u00a0\u00a0She put me on an antibotic, saying that I have an infection.Maybe that is all it is, but I am still concerend.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I'm not getting any better yet.\u00a0\u00a0I go back to the doctor in 2 weeks for another check and to get a pelvic exam.\u00a0\u00a0I will know for sure then, although the agony of not knowing is driving me insane.\u00a0\u00a0Please respond.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
