            "answer": "I was just diagnosed with gestational diabetes last week.\u00a0\u00a0Fasting means no food or drink.\u00a0\u00a0However, you may drink as much water as you want, just don't add anything like lemon juice (that is something I do when I drink water, or did, rather).\u00a0\u00a0Talk to the nurse first, but I believe you can also have plain black coffee, nothing added.\u00a0\u00a0The 3 hour test is usually a 12 hour fast.\u00a0\u00a0They will do a fasting blood test first.\u00a0\u00a0Then you will drink the glucose solution wich is more concentrated then the one hour test glucose was.\u00a0\u00a0Then they will do one blood draw every hour for 3 hours.\u00a0\u00a0At least that is how they did mine.\u00a0\u00a0However, my fasting test was high and my first blood test after drinking the solution was high, so they stopped and made the diagnosis at that point.If you do have diabetes, you will probably meet with a dietician first to choose a diet that is right for you.\u00a0\u00a0I think that they like to try to control this with diet first before they use medications.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0I am still trying to understand it myself.Regards,Shelly",

            "answer": "My doctor office said don't have orange juice because it is sweet it can cause a wrong reading. Just to be safe I wouldn't drink anything other than water. I had to do the 3 hour test with my first son and was just borderline gestational diabetes so I didn't have to go through some of the things people who really have it have to go through. They thought my son might be big but he was only 7 pounds 8 ounces. Good Luck!! Ginger",

Meaning you may not have the blood sugar problem after you give birth. I'm sure Christie can shed more light on this one though.Heather",
