Every other visit they have. I would think they would want to check again to see what my count is. I had my last blood test at about 12 weeks so I'm sure it's changed some.",

Also found out my platelets are low. Like 100, 000. If they go lower then we worry. That's ok for now. Also my placenta is low so if it goes any lower then that may present a problem. But for now everything is ok and baby boy weighs about 11 oz. Funny, I could see the little boy part as soon as she rolled over that area. Even before she said it. Yep, obviously all boy!",
