            "answer": "Being on replacement thyroid meds, you should wait an hour after taking medication and do not eat any foods with fiber for four hours prior to or after taking the meds. There is also a list of other foods that screw up your absorption of the medication, like brocolli, cauliflour, soy, You can look them up on line, there are several. Good Luck FTB4",

            "answer": "If you dont have a glucose problem, fruit is an easy on the go breakfast. If you work in an office, can you make instant oatmeal in a cup? Really, who has time to cook in the AM during the week?.You can bring that one hour time frame down to 45 minutes. If you are consistent about this shortened time it will reflect in needing a little more med per day, no big deal - and that will be tested and increased soon since you just started on thy med. The key is consistency. Your med levels are partially based on how you absorb the med. The longer you wait, the more is absorbed. So if you eat within an hour you must try to do so everyday, for the same amount of absorption, not too much, not to little.",

You just shouldn't take calcium supplements at the same time you take your thyroid medication - separate them by, at least, 4 hours.\u00a0\u00a0My doctors recommend that I take calcium supplements (1000 mg/day), along with eating various food that contain calcium in order to prevent osteoporosis and with a regimen of calcium, magnesium and exercise, I have actually rebuilt lost bone.\u00a0\u00a0I just have to space my supplements and certain foods throughout the day.Taking thyroid med at night is fine for some, but doesn't work for everyone, as some of us have other meds to take at night that also interfere with the thyroid med.",

    "question": "Today was my second dose of Synthroid that I ever took.\u00a0\u00a0I came home from the hospital yesterday after a completion thryoidectomy and now I'm thinking about how I should be eating when I go back to work next week.In the past, it was so easy to just pack a can of Ensure (30% of your daily calcium), grab a yogurt, or take a long \"Breakstones Cottage Cheese Double\" to eat when I got to work.\u00a0\u00a0These things were so EASY to eat for breakfast!\u00a0\u00a0From what I've read, it seems that these options will be out of the question until 4 hours after taking my new pill due to their calcium.What other options are out there? I don't think I can eat eggs every morning to avoid the calcium, but I do need a fairly substantial breakfast to function well.\u00a0\u00a0Are these foods things that I should avoid until lunchtime now, or is it an amount of calcium that won't do any harm in terms of absorption?\u00a0\u00a0Do I even have the option of eating cereal with milk in it anymore before I leave for work?Although I have no problem waking up to take medicine and waiting an hour to eat while I get ready for work, I'm starting to panic a little about how I will handle my breakfasts.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions would be welcome!\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!",
