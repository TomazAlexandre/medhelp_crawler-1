            "answer": "Hi, I'd have the same pain as your. 24 years ago, before I had the left side removed, I had the sciatica problem on my left leg. At that time, I didn't know they were related. In 2001, I had the same pain on my right leg and in my lower back. At the same time the thyroid gland on my right side started to swell bigger and bigger. Until today when I read your post I think they were related.Anyway, in 2001 I did the exercise called: Discovering Chi with Linda Modaro, in one week, my pain had gone and I kept doing that exercise for long time. I did not have that sciatica pain since then but my goiter kept swelling big. I had my TT on May 1st. Just some info for you. (About the exercise, when my sister started to have diabetes she did that exercise for 3 months and she did not have diabetes anymore. When she heard that I had the sciatica pain she gave me that tape and told me to try. It did work.)I'm still doing that exercise until now.",

    "question": "Hi. It's been quite a while, since I've posted.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed several months ago with Graves disease, and I'm now on PTU.Over the last 2 months I've had recurring back pain -- it's a striking pain that goes from my back all the way down by left leg.\u00a0\u00a0I can find comfortable positions, but it hurts when I'm moving around.Around the time that I was being diagnosed, I believe I had a lot of deterioration of my muscles.\u00a0\u00a0It always felt as if I had done a hard workout the day before.\u00a0\u00a0My body was under a lot of stress.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I'm interested to know if the two could be linked.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone else experienced similar pains and/or know if the two could be related?Thanks!",
