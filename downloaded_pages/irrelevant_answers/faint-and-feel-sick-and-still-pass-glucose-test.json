When a patient faints or feels really gross with out throwing up we have them lie in a room and we come to them to draw blood.

I'm eating the same things I've always eaten just making sure I add snacks and limit sugar intake)\u00a0\u00a0I go to a high risk team of docs, dieticians and nutritionist once a week and need an ultrasound monthly.
