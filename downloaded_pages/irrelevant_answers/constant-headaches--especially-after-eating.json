Although another symptom of diabetes is increased thirst which you do not have.Dehydration can cause severe headaches. Please make sure you are sufficiently rehydrated.Also your shunt may need to be replaced. High Intracranial pressure can also cause headaches.I would suggest you to get your sinus infection treated with antibiotics and get a thorough clinical exam done. Do keep us posted!",

    "question": "I have headaches every day, all day and night, sometimes they lighten up after being awake for six or seven hours, but they return after I eat. Mostly the headaches seem like sinus, in the forhead, behind left eye, pain in temples, head feels like pressure,and pressure in ears, and sometimes teeth hurt.\u00a0\u00a0Back of my head hurts near brain stem, and I get a tension type lump in my neck on the left side in the back.\u00a0\u00a0But I also get pain in the lower left side of the back of my brain, where there is no brain, because of a bleeding aneurysm years ago. I crave sugar, and sugar seems to alieviate the headache if I eat alot of it.\u00a0\u00a0I am confused all the time, and my sinuses burn and my head hurts all the time.\u00a0\u00a0I have had three or four brain surgeries, and multiple aneurysms that burst, with atm grade 4 which was removed.\u00a0\u00a0I have a shunt that may or may not be working after eight years.What if anything would you suggest.\u00a0\u00a0I am a vegan vegetarian, could my diet be causing this?\u00a0\u00a0Also I have a serious lack of thirst, I am almost never thirsty, I have to force about 8 ounces of fluid per day, if I remember. Cold alot of the time.\u00a0\u00a0I have searched the internet until I am overwhelmed by possibilities, and even more confused, looking for anything that can help.",
