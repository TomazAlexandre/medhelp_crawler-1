Then discuss with your doctor whether it is OK to take Viagra, or Cialis, or Goat Weed [aka horny goat weed].

            "answer": "Visit your endochronologist and have your testosterone levels evaluated. The test must be done early in\u00a0\u00a0the morning before breakfast. You may be prescribed transdermal testosterone. It comes in 2 mg/day and 4 mg/day patches. It is very expensive.\u00a0\u00a0And a very controlled drug. You place the patch on your forearm or leg every evening. Be careful not to use more than one patch a day. Unfortunately, it will not assist in obtaining an erection, however it will definitely increase libido and desire for opposite sex companionship. As an alternative, daily doses of DHEA will sometimes help, but you should have your levels tested before beginning this drug. All steroids can cause atrophy of the testicles and increase the probability of a malignancy.",
