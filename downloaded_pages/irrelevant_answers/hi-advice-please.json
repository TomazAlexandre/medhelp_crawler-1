            "answer": "generally as long as there are no problems during the operation there shouldnt be any risk to the fetus, especially as it is brain surgery. abdominal surgery would pose a greater risk as it would be closer to the uterus but even then the risk isnt high at all. if you medically stable, and by that i mean no hypertension, diabetes, bleeding disorders, liver or kidney problems then it should be relatively safe",

            "answer": "Hi,A well planned and carefully monitored brain surgery would not present with a risk for the foetus. You need to consult a well experienced anesthetist, neurosurgeon and gynecologist to plan and carry out the surgical procedure. Please consult the gynecologist to get complete investigations done to find if you are fit for surgery.\u00a0\u00a0If she considers you fit, you can go ahead. If you are in experienced hands, you are safe along with the foetus. Hope this helps you. Take care and regards!",
