I have heard of plenty of people that have had gestational diabetes though and I think it's more common then u think. Pregnancy itself is scary but try to remain calm and ask your doctor about things before getting freaked out lol",

            "answer": "A baby can die because its mother had GD during the pregnancy. BUT it is very rare. I don't know 1 in how many but its rare. It can happen when the baby is so big (fat) that it has trouble breathing. But if you give birth to a big baby, the medical staff knows the risk and will keep an eye on the baby to make sure it is fine. If necessary, it may have to have breathing aid for a day or 2. But if you live in a developped country and give birth in a hospital, there is nothing to worry about. Like the others said, try to stay off google and ask questions to medicaly trained people who can give you a correct answer.",
