            "answer": "I'd hold back on sweets of ANY kind for dogs anyway. Not a good idea. It will rot their teeth, and might cause diabetes.Sometimes I found that affection is often the best treat for a dog. It doesn't always have to be food. The sound of your voice, laughing, a rub of the ears, a few silly words......those can mean a lot to a dog. Many dogs are very happy to please. They love these signs of pleasure and affection from us. They will often learn quick if they get that.",

But I don't think mangoes and all the other food is a good idea. Not for a 5 week old pup, like we said before in your last post. He needs something from the vet for when he is weaned, (old enough to eat solid food) some puppy food from the vet might be a good idea to start with.",
