She was a black patient, in her 40's, and she combative and out of it, but she was eating remarkably well (but wasting). This was at least 15 years ago, though, and so - I might be way off base on what was causing the wasting, but I do remember the docs being surprised that she was found to have ... I think - Thalassemia.",

What the heck am I thinking of?\u00a0\u00a0It's not Thalasemia.\u00a0\u00a0Now I'm going to be wondering and wondering what that woman was diagnosed with -- it was rare to see it in this country, as I recall.\u00a0\u00a0And it had to do with the body being totally unable to get any nutrients from foods\u00a0\u00a0(the poor children in those awful countries that suffer from starvation - once they are so emaciated, they eventually can't absorb anything, and it's whatever that is, I think.)\u00a0\u00a0And for the life of me, I can't think of it, but it is not Thalasemia\u00a0\u00a0HAHAHAHA\u00a0\u00a0hmmm.\u00a0\u00a0brain fogged more than I thought.\u00a0\u00a0Now I'm going to go try and find it - gee thanks Kalio, now I gotta go to google and google starvation!I keep thinking it'll come to me as I'm writing this note, but it's not.\u00a0\u00a0hmmm....:)",

            "answer": "PREVALENCE OF MALNUTRITIONMalnutrition is prevalent in all forms of liver disease;from 20% in compensated liver disease tomore than 80% in those patients with decompensateddisease (1,2). Patients with alcoholic liverdisease are reported to have a greater incidence ofmalnutrition than those with nonalcoholic disease (3).Protein energy malnutrition has been reported in 100%of those who receive liver transplant, and malnutritionis an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortalityin these patients (4). Frequently, patients with endstagehepatic failure will present with muscle wasting,decreased fat stores, and overt cachexia. However,many more patients will have subtle changes such asfat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, anemia from iron,folate, and pyridoxine deficiency, altered cell-mediatedimmune function, and slow loss of muscle mass.http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/digestive-health/nutritionarticles/jun03krenitskyarticle.pdf",
