            "answer": "Hello, that is called the \"dawn phenomenon\".\u00a0\u00a0It is an early sign of diabetes in many whose blood sugar would appear normal at other times.\u00a0\u00a0It happens when the liver dumps glucose in the early morning in response to the overnight fasting.\u00a0\u00a0The insulin response to this is abnormal (ie not sufficient) and therefore the High FBS.FBS of 130 would already make him diabetic.Does he get high blood sugars after eating?\u00a0\u00a0Time to test is 2 hours after the start of a meal.\u00a0\u00a0Truly normal numbers are likely around 100, but medical profession say that < 120 is considered normal.A1C of 6.2 is already close to diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0THey say 6.3 is the cutoff for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0However, optimal A1C should be < 5.0.For me I find I can reduce the dawn effect, by limiting how many carbs I eat.\u00a0\u00a0On a low carb diet I can normalise my fasting blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0but on high calorie and/or carb it will go high.I find that a very low carb diet is far more effective at controlling blood sugars than the typical high carb diet that many with diabetes adopt.\u00a0\u00a0(ie.\u00a0\u00a0American Diabetic Association would say I should eat about 240 g of carbs per day.\u00a0\u00a0If I ate that much my blood sugars would be all over the place and through the roof.\u00a0\u00a0If I eat 50 - 70 g of carbs per day (spreadout, of course over the day), my blood sugars are 'normal' and no-one could tell that I am really diabetic.",
