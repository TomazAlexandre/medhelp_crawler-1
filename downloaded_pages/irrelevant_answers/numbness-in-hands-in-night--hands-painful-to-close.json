            "answer": "Hi,There\u2019s a high possibility of a carpal tunnel syndrome in your case. In this, the median nerve which passes under a structure around the wrist can get compressed and this gives rise to the symptoms of numbness or sometimes tingling sensations and the symptoms are usually worse at night. This cna be due a number of reasons like a past wrist injury, hypothyroidism, diabetes etc. For the confirmation of the diagnosis, a physical examination and some blood tests may be required. I\u2019ll suggest you to consult a physician for the same. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
