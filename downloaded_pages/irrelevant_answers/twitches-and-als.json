            "answer": "Hi!ALS fasciculations can be localized or generalized, but usually weakness of muscles and fasciculations affect the same area, usually a limb. Fasciculations are usually a sign of lower motor neuron disease, and occur due to depolarization of a lower motor neuron causing twitch in the skeletal muscle being supplied by it. They can come and go with periods of no activity in between.ALS like symptoms can be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, severe anemia, spinal nerve compression high up in the cervical spine, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritic changes of the vertebrae, calcium deficiency, low Vit D, electrolyte disturbance, multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or hypothyroidism or due to bad posture. Lyme and lupus are the other possibilities.Fasciculation without weakness are unlikely to be due to ALS. Please consult your doctor regarding this.
