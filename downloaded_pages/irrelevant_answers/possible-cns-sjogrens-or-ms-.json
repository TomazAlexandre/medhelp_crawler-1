            "answer": "I can offer you this advise based on what I personally have experienced. This again is only My Opinion.I have a MS diagnosis...for many years, but am now treating with antibiotics. I did a lot of reading about the similarities between MS and Lyme. I sought out a doctor who specializes in lyme, got a blood test from a lab that tests for all the bands, and eventually was clinically diagnosed with Lyme.You mention band 41 being positive? What about all the other bands? If \"where\" you were tested for lyme didn't test for all the bands, you might want to consider getting a Western Blot?Lyme isn't easy to diagnosis, but if we the patient are given a fair opportunity at testing...we might be able to get solid answers for why we are sick.Best to you,tory",
