    "question": "So i had a midwife appoint. Today and she says baby is comfortable and is not coming out anytime soon =/ last week at 39 weeks baby was 3/5 engaged now he/she has decided to go the opposite way and is now 5/5 errhh so over it so looks like im gonna probably be induced in the nxt 2wks (which i wanted to avoid!!!) Nxt week im scheduled to have monitoring done on baby and a induction date made. This is the longest ive been pregnant and feeling as though baby will never come! (My first was induced at 39wks due to diabetes my second came on her own at 38 weeks) i just want it over now and am very uncomfortable and frustrated. Sorry i just felt like having a rant as it feels as though baby is going in the wrong direction!!! Has anyone else been in my position? And did u make it to the induction date or did u go into labour before hand? Thanks ladies",
