            "answer": "125 mg/dl is considered prediabetic. However, since 126 mg/dl is the bottom line for diabetes, most doctors would consider you diabetic. Losing weight helps tremendously along with proper nutrition in lowering glucose. Metformin (glucophage) was prescribed to help lower your glucose probably due to the A-Fib meds. So what do you do? Discuss with your doctors the steps you need to take in order to get off the A-Fib meds.\u201cI did the 2 hour glucose test and my A1C was 166.\u201dThe A1c results are in percentage (%) where <6 (less than) is considered normal.\u201ci can't seems to get any one to look into the BBlocker/blood sugar connection.\u201dGoogle search results on beta blockers vs diabetes connection:http://www.kup.at/kup/pdf/707.pdfhttp://tinyurl.com/5fmaq7http://www.chfpatients.com/coreg.htmhttp://tinyurl.com/6a8de2American Diabetes Association (ADA) web site http://tinyurl.com/62zudg returned 534 hits.",

I have just printed out the links you sent and will go over them tonight.I tried telling my cardiologist and endocrinologist, one sort if ignored me and the endocrinologist explained that if you took someone of the street and gave him bBlockers he would not develop higher blood sugar?

    "question": "Hi All,I'm new to this so bear with me.I'm 52, in good health except I could stand to lose 25lbs. I ride a bike 11.5 miles 5 days a week without fail.In July 2008 I had a bout of A-Fib, lone A-fib to be exact that put me in the hospital for 5 days until I was converted electrically. It has happed 4 times in 21 years and usually on lasts 8 hours +/-. I was put on Sotalol, digoxin, and Comudin and Zocor.Now my diabetes question. I was told a month ago that my blood sugar was a little high (125) I did the 2 hour glucose test and my A1C was 166. I am perplexed as no one in my family has diabetes, my weight isn't bad and I exercise regularly. The doctor suggested I start Glucophage (sp).I was perplexed by the blood sugar and spoke with my pharmacist who said that recent studies have suggested that Beta Blockers may cause a rise in blood sugar numbers. All my doctors want me to stay on the Beta Blockers. I get the feeling, perhaps inaccurate, that the symptoms are being treated and not me. i can't seems to get any one to look into the BBlocker/blood sugar connection.Has anyone heard of this, any suggestions. I gotta tell you I am worried about this.",
