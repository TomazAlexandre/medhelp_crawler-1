            "answer": "Yes you can go to ssa.gov (the official website) to see the full information and criteria for Social Security. This can be discussed with a psychiatrist so they have a fuller understanding of what needs to be written (as long as it is also what they have noted and diagnosed) for a person to be eligible. As well if you now have diabetes obtain full written confirmation of that from a treating physician. Also if a person is denied for Social Security they should apply for a fair hearing (officially ALJ administrative law judge hearing) as soon as possible. Then from they should try to find appropriate representation. There are agencies that can provide free legal representation and there are other agencies (such as independent living centers there is one in every county of every state) some of which provide free non legal representation and can assist in the matter. Its best to have everything coordinated beforehand. Also you need to prove why you would not be able to do the work you did before and how those work skills could not transfer to full time jobs (I am familiar with all this being that I did representation in the past before I acquired my physical disability)",

            "answer": "It also helps a LOT if you have a case manager to work on the case for you.\u00a0\u00a0I had a case manager help me win my case on the very first try, she told me things I needed to collect for it and I suggested things and she told me if it would help or not and so she did the rest with the things I had submitted to her, but don't get your hopes up with winning it the first go, most people are denied the first time and I don't know for sure what made them decide to approve me the first time, but I'm not complaining by all means.",

            "answer": "Great advice already but just wanted to add how important getting someone on your side is..you need an advocate and a pysch doc and that should sort things re disability.Prematurity can cause learning difficulties and long term brain damage from lack of oxygen, and a lot of treatment given to pre term babies to keep them alive can cause problems later in life..I had twins at 27 weeks so I know the after effects..to be born with an addiction to probably the worst illegal substance is just crippling, amazing you are still here, your body and brain went through hell so it's not surprising how you are now..Basically what I'm saying is you've had a lot of **** thrown at you from such a young age that you need to completely overhaul everything, you can't do it without professional advice, you have to relearn so much..Good luck!!!",
