            "answer": "First we need to know what the reference range is for the Free T4. Ranges vary lab to lab and have to come from your own report.A good way to list labs is like this:TSH\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00.34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(0.45-4.5)FT4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(x.x - x.x)Total T4 is considered obsolete and of little value.Do you have any other symptoms of hyper, besides heart palps?\u00a0\u00a0There are a lot of things that can cause those, as well as the need to eat.Yes, your symptoms \"could\" be caused by hyper, but they could also be caused by diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Prior to being diagnosed with Type I diabetes, my son at like a horse and lost weight so fast, I couldn't believe my eyes. You should get checked for diabetes.\"I don't think I've had T3 levels checked, if I have they weren't abnormal because I was never told what they were.\"\u00a0\u00a0Many times levels can be \"in range\", but are not normal for the individual; many doctors only look at the result and range, without taking individual needs into consideration.\u00a0\u00a0Levels I need to be comfortable may be too high/low for you.Free T3 is the hormone that's actually used by the individual cells and correlates best with symptoms, so is much more important than either TSH or FT4.\u00a0\u00a0You really need to get that tested.All of that said, have you been diagnosed with a thyroid condition?\u00a0\u00a0Are you on a thyroid medication of any kind?\u00a0\u00a0If so, which medication, what dosage and for how long have you been on it?",

            "answer": "I haven't been tested for diabetes itself but my blood sugar is always perfect... there was one time that I had barely eaten all day and felt like I was going to pass out but my blood sugar was still normal.I think the range for free T4 was 0.8-1.8, and mine was 1.4 once and 1.44 another time.I haven't been diagnosed with anything yet.",

I am trying to find a good endo but I need a referral for the ones closest to me and my doc hasn't okayed the referral yet. This is a real pain!",

    "question": "I have heard SO much mixed info about thyroid levels and it's driving me crazy... don't know what I'm doing requesting MORE info but I'm trying to get an understanding of this so here goes.My TSH is 0.34. In August it was 0.6. The lab's range is 0.45-4.5 but I have heard 0.3-3.0 is more accurate. Is this true?Free T4 was 1.4 most recently, but was 1.44 in August.I had total T4 checked in July and it was borderline high, I forget what the number was.I don't think I've had T3 levels checked, if I have they weren't abnormal because I was never told what they were.I can't think of ANYTHING else that would be causing my symptoms, especially the heart palpitations and needing to eat often, so could thyroid levels like mine cause hyperthyroid symptoms? I am so confused by all the conflicting opinions.",
