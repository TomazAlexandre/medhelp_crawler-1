            "answer": "Hi,the symptoms that you describe here can occur with vertigo. Vertigo by itself is a symptom and not a disease, therefore the disease may still need to be diagnosed. You may have to visit an Ear nose and throat specialist to get a final diagnosis after examination and testing.\"Vertigo (from the Latin vertere, to turn, and the suffix -igo, a condition, i.e., \"a condition of turning about\"[1]) is a specific type of dizziness, a major symptom of a balance disorder. It is the sensation of spinning or swaying while the body is stationary with respect to the surroundings.There are two types of vertigo: subjective and objective. There is a subjective vertigo when a person has a false sensation of movement. In the case of objective vertigo, the surroundings appear to move past a person's field of vision.The effects of vertigo may be slight. It can cause nausea and vomiting and, in severe cases, it may give rise to difficulties with standing and walking.\"You may find more information at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigolet me know if you may need any more help.",

    "question": "For just about 8 months now (beginning January 3, 2007, actually) I have been experiencing a steadily increasing (albeit slowly) series of symptoms as follows:*Vertigo*Falling, not always caused by the vertigo*Numbness (front of the torso, lower legs, lower arms, face [especially jaw and tongue])*Confusion*WeaknessThis has caused me to fall on multiple occasions, usually because of the vertigo or sudden weakness. This is not diabetes or hypoglycemia, those have been ruled out. Neither is it anything that would show up on a blood workup.I just want some sort of direction to look in. I'm 20 years old, and while I'm stressed (I'm a college student, of course I'm stressed) it's not that bad, I've never had any sort of problems like this before in my life. I was a healthy kid and suddenly this sets in.",
