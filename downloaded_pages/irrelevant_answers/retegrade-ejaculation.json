            "answer": "Hello,Diabetes can cause neuropathy of the bladder sphincter and hence retrogarde ejaculation. Retrograde ejaculation caused by diabetes or surgery may be improved with a medication that improves the muscle tone of the bladder neck.In addition you should control your blood sugar levels and do some kegel exercises to tone up the muscles.I hope this helps. Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "Hi, I have the same thing but it was due to bladderneck and prostate surgery. I was told that I would not father any children after the surgery. To the surprise to my wife and I, my wife became pregnant about 7 months after my surgery.My retrograde ejeculation caused no visable semen to be ejeculated, yet there was enough to conceive our youngest daughter. I was 30 when I had the surgery. Now at 46 things still look the same, other than having had a vasectomy as an intervention of orchitis and epididymitis.All though it is less likely that a pregnancy will occur the possibility is there.All the best.Ron",
