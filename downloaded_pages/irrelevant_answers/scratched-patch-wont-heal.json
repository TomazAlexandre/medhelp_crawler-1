            "answer": "pastir,Do you mean that the injured area is still raw, with no new skin forming over the surface?How large is this area?Have you ever had a problem with healing before?One idea would be to use hot compresses, which would increase blood circulation to the area and would help it to heal.Wring a thick wash cloth out in hot water, fold, and apply to your knee.As it cools, refold the cloth to a warmer area.After a few minutes, you'll need to wring it out again in hot water.Keep this up for ten or fifteen minutes.Repeat every hour or two.Leave it open to the air as much as possible, so that it dries out.Do not apply lotions or salves.\u00a0\u00a0Let a scab form.Hot compresses take some work on your part, and can be boring to do.They relax the blood vessels at the injury, and with more blood flow the components in the blood heal the damaged skin.This works also for infections.Since it has been two months, it may be time to have your family doctor evaluate it.Sometime people with diabetes, with poor blood circulation, will have problems with injuries healing on their feet and legs.Bookmark this page, and let me know how it goes with the hot compresses.If you do go to the doctor's, I'd be interested in what he says.Wishing you the best,Carol",

            "answer": "Heh, I never would have guessed that it was psoriasis from your description.I'm glad you had it evaluated by a physician.Keep hot compresses in mind if you should ever have a problem with an abscess or a wound that won't heal.Best,Carol",

    "question": "I fell from a bicyle around 2 months ago and hit the asphalt with my knee, so I had an area of skin there scratched. Nothing seriousl really, I`m sure everybody has had a number of those and so did I when I was a little younger.But the difference now is that the patch just wont heal. The skin just won`t restore itself to normal again. The damaged patch of pink/red has endured for 2 months now neither growing nor skhrinking in size.What is more unless I wash it every day or two little white pieces of dead skin start apperaring on its surface.Any ideas?",
