    "question": "my husband has diabetes. He has other diseases that were diagnosed after each gastro incident that put him in the emergency room for dehydration. all seemed to be guesses...Now he takes so many medications I am worried that some are the cause. He throws up most mornings, even after not a lot of food the night before. His stomach contents are vial looking, very brown and thick. They episodes are dehydrating him. He takes: aspirin, lipitor, allegra, losartin, atenolol, plavix, protonix, hydrochlorothiazide and lantus and humulog for his diabetes. He was on reglan for a short time. He was diagnosed after many episodes with esophogitis and I cant recall the last one having to do with his stomach not emptying properly. He has been to a gastroenterologist and recently saw an new endocrinologist. He recently had a colonoscopy, his DR. was very pleased with the condition of his colon. He is 64yrs old and a tennis pro...help!",
