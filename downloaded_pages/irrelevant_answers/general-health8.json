            "answer": "Can you take Benedryl at night.? I take Cyproheptadine at night. It is an older benedryl like drug that helps with allergies, lessen\u00a0\u00a0migraine and helps you sleep. But, the first day or two you are knocked out in the day time. You get used to it pretty fast and it works for me so far. The only two draw backs are it increases appetite, and dry mouth and nose. I take it every day. If it doesn't help with allergy it will help with sleep. Also, if you know what you are allergic to you can see an allergist and get shots to desensitize you.",
