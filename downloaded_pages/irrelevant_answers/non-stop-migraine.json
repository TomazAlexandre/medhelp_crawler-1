            "answer": "You need to get help for the pituitary tumor even though they are not treating it as a finding. You are symptomatic even though they do not think so. The lactatation and headaches are a clue. Plus they only did basic bloodwork probably and not all the pit hormones most likely - did you get IGF-1, ACTH, LH, FSH, ADH and TSH in addition to the PRL?Going on anti-depressants now will just interfere with testing.\u00a0\u00a0The depression is a symptom, not the cause. It is hormonal. You need a pituitary doc.The vitamins fall with this too - did they check D - that goes as well.Get thee to a neuro- endo, not a diabetes endo.",

            "answer": "Great!Was the ACTH in a chilled tube, spun immediately (while you were sitting there) and the tech knew it was a frozen test? It degrades in minutes at room temp so if it went into a bin, the results are wrong.Were your tests done in the morning, fasting? Any other hormone tests done? Are they planning on repeating the tests?I ask as my tumor was said to be an \"incidentaloma\" when I was lactating - as I only had a modestly elevated prolaction. But I had a lot of symptoms besides - migraines aside, and I ended up having a lot of issues. so make sure that\u00a0\u00a0you are monitored.In the end, I had a prolactinoma and Cushing's disease.",
