            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Sudden soreness, numbness etc in pinky finger and hands could be due to nerve compression. This is possible at various levels. It could be due to compression of the spinal nerves at the cervical spine level or, ulnar nerve at the elbow level. Hypothyroidism, diabetes, tumors and infections of the ulnar and spinal nerves and rheumatism can all cause these symptoms. Please consult a neurologist.Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi, I sometimes get a very strange sensation in my hands. I haven't had it for a few weeks till yesterday again. It started this time in my left hands little finger and gradually spread throughout that hand and an hour or two later spread into the other hand. The best way to describe the feeling is as if you have a really bad bruise but there is nothing to see. They don't appear swollen or anything but are very tender and if I knock them at all it feels like a shooting pain through my hand almost as if it has broken the bone (but luckily hasn't!) It has been know to spread down my arms too as far as just above my elbows, however I usually find that If I take a couple of painkillers it goes and doesn't come back again for weeks/months. Sometimes I get it more often than others, but no idea what triggers it. I don't really monitor it as such because as soon as the pain goes I forget about it till the next time. Does anyone have the same thing or have any idea what it could be, I hate going to the doctors cos I feel like I'm being a hypercondriac and wasting their time.x x x",
