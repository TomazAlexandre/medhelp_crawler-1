            "answer": "HiHeart transplant is one of the most common transplant operations performed in the United States. It is a valid therapeutic option even in elderly patients with end-stage heart failure. However, older patients are at higher risk for serious infections and for developing steroid-related complications.Nowadays, most transplantation centers are more liberal in extending the age limit of recipients. The age of a potential recipient should be regarded as an important risk factor for extended survival and but not be used as a sole criterion of exclusion.Heart transplant surgery is not recommended for patients who have kidney, lung, or liver disease, Insulin dependent diabetes with poor function of other organs or other life-threatening diseases.The major problems are perhaps finding a donor, avoiding infection, rejection and the cost involved.You may consider a second opinion.

            "answer": "Hi,There are absolute and relative contraindications that needs to be considered to heart transplantation. Absolute contraindications include active infection, untreated malignancy, coexisting systemic illness likely to limit survival, severe and irreversible major organ dysfunction or fixed elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.Relative contraindications, on the other, include: advanced age, recent or unresolved pulmonary infection, active peptic ulceration, marked peripheral or cerebrovascular disease or\u00a0\u00a0mental illness. These conditions may vary from one institution to another. As long as she does not fulfill the absolute contraindications, a second opinion from another cardiologist which entails further evaluation of your sister-in-law may be done.Take care and regards.",
