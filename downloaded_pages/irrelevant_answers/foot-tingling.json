            "answer": "Since you posted on this forum, we're going to assume you're a type 2 diabetic. Your post, however, has unanswered questions.1. Was you FSB normal or not?2. Is GTT a glucose tolerance test, your FSB test? Is 6.3 in mmol/l?4. You mention Gabatine for pain, but what medicine[s] are you taking, and dose, to help your diabetes?MVT appears to be acupressure and wound care combined. Do you have access to someone who practices acupressure? What about Acupuncture for pain management?When posting/ responding please do not use acronyms. Try to provide the medical term so we don't have to assume or try to interpret what you're trying to get across.",

            "answer": "It is obvious to me now, Rahim, that your glucose levels are normal ruling out diabetes as the cause of your neurothapy. Non-diabetic neurothapy has been linked to vitamin B-1 and folic acid [B-9] deficiencies. Ask your doctor about the latter. I also suggest you split your multivitamin into two halves, taking one in the morning, the other later in the day. This will help balance out the vitamin intake during your wake hours. Progress is being made with the vitamin supplements, as it will take time for you to recover fully from two years of illness.As far as MVT, try contacting MicroVas to see if they sold a machine close to you. In the meantime, I suggest you try mascular [massage] therapy and acupuncture. Both help greatly with circulation. Finally, continue to maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating healthy and exercising daily. Good luck.",
