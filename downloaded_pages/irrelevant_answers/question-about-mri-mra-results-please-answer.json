            "answer": "Hi,Your MRI findings are unremarkable except for the fact that there is one focal high intensity focus in the white matter.This can be due to a number of benign causes like chronic headache, migraine, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, alcoholism etc.Your symptoms of pressure in the head could be due to sinusitis, ear infections, and TMJ or Temporormandibular joint infection.Please relax if you had a brain tumor both CT scan and MRI would have been able to pick it up.",
