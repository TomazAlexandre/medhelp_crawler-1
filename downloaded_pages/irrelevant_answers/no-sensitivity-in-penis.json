            "answer": "Hi there!Well, there could be a few reasons for loss of penile sensations including psychological stress/ anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders, medications, trauma, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis, vascular causes etc. just to name a few. Minor trauma may play a role in temporary loss of sensations. I would suggest giving it sometime and avoiding trauma to the region.\u00a0\u00a0It might also be beneficial to get rid of factors like smoking/ alcohol/ drugs, if involved. If the symptoms do not seem to improve in 1-2 weeks, you may consider a detailed evaluation by a urologist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "Hi,I have a problem regarding loss of sensation in my penis shaft.I was using a water based penis pump for 3 months from Jan to April this year.I began noticing numbness when masturbating so discontinued use of the pump.Today, despite having quit the pump for two months I cannot achieve any pleasurable sensationsFrom masturbation, my penis just feels like rubber. At first I thought this must be due to nerve damage however 6 weeks ago my sensitivity mysteriously returned to normal, I got that intense pleasurable feeling back again , this made me so happy and gave me peace of mind. However the numbness then returned for about a week, and then a few days of restored sensitivity again.It's been 4 weeks now and my penis still feels like rubber to touch.I am feeling very confused and distressed by this.I am finding that I'm constantly rubbing my penis everyday to check the sensitivity is coming back, but it isn't.How could my penis be numb and cold one day, then back to normal? If the pump caused nerve damageHow could my sensitivity have returned for a while after I quit it?I am so confused,Please help.Many thanks.",
