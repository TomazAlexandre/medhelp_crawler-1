            "answer": "I agree. I do not think that BMI should necessarily be the end word. I am 5'7+\" and weigh 134. I look emaciated. I have small wrists, but huge hands, shoulders that never should have been bestowed upon a woman, a huge ribcage, and very large ankles. My BMI does not put me as underweight, however, I look skeletal. Not that I want to lose weight, but it is very deceiving to look at the BMI and still feel the pressure to go toward the lower end of normal; even when people say that I look terrible. I have large muscles too. I will never be petite, and the BMI should probably have 3 separate levels for each gender. Small framed, medium framed, and large framed. My opinion only, but logical, I think!",

He uses that to evaluate your weight loss. he does not refer to the BMI at all. he tells me that the most important thing is to decrese the fat content and to maintain muscle,as you said the BMI is so generic",

There is a list of olympic GOLD medal winners from Athens 2004 who are all considered overweight or even obese based on the BMI.See <a href=\"http://www.dietandfitnesstoday.com/bmiathletes.php\">www.dietandfitnesstoday.com/bmiathletes.php</a> A lot of the questions in the forum are also addressed in the BMI FAQ.",
