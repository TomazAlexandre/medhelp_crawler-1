            "answer": "He may be suffering from what is known as hypoglycemic unawareness, which happens when a person has a number of lows so close together that the body can't really recover from one before another happens. It really is up to your son to take care of the problem, but he may not really be having warning symptoms when he drops low. The solution is to ask him to test more often, say every 2-3 hours, until he is able to go 2 weeks without any lows. That will help him recover his warning symptoms.Another thing that may be helpful is for you to figure out some way for him to always have some carbs handy wherever he is. Glucose tablets are sometimes the best for men because men don't carry bags like women do and therefore can't easily carry juice or snacks. Glucose tablets come in yummy flavors (I like orange ones) and you can purchase a bottle of them, and then put about 10-15 of them in a small ziploc snack baggie for him to carry in his pockets. Then he always has something handy if he feels himself getting a little low.",
