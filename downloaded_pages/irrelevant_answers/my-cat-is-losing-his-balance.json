            "answer": "Well reasons are many. Your cat may be losing balance because he probably had a stroke, viral disease or ear infections. Whatever is causing this as well as the vomiting and weight loss is potentially dangerous. You need to contact your vet ASAP. Your cat may look normal outwardly, but have very serious internal problems. Everything you mentioned is more than enough reason to take the cat to the vet. Don't wait any longer.",

    "question": "I have a 10 year old male, declawed, indoor, neutered, siamese short hair cat. About 5 days ago he was 100% fine but all of a sudden hes lost his balance, he still can walk , but he cant jump or make fast turns very well. Also hes gotten skinnier out of the blue this past 2 weeks. He was throwing up about every time we feed him but we bought a different kind of cat food and hes stopped but he still does it like once a week. Also this past month his fur has been getting knots like crazy. He is part of our family and we want to know what this could be. We havent brought him to the vet yet but we will very very soon as soon as we fine some reasons on what this could be and we do fear the worst so can anybody please help. Thanks",
