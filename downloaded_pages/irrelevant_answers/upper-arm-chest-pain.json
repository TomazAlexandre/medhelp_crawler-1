            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Get a dopplar study or a duplex ultrasound of the blood vessels of the arm. There could be a plaque formed somewhere. A 24 hour holter should be done to assess if there is any ectopic or cardiac abnormality. Blood pressure monitoring should be done.Apart from this diabetes, thyroid problems and serum electrolytes should be tested. Also consult your gynecologist and get complete hormone analysis done. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I have pain that develops in my upper right arm, and spreads across the chest, to the back and on over to my upper left arm.\u00a0\u00a0It comes on suddenly with no precipitating events.\u00a0\u00a0It lasts only from about 15-30 seconds and is gone.\u00a0\u00a0During the event, I can hardly stand up and am extremely weak afterward.The only time we were able to reproduce the pain was during a chemical stress test just after the adenosine was administered.\u00a0\u00a0It happened immediately.EKG's show nothing; echocardiogram shows only impaired left ventricle relaxation.Any ideas would be appreciated because doctors don't seem to be concerned because of the brevity of the attack.\u00a0\u00a0My concern is if one occurs when I am driving, or doing an activity where my well-being might be compromised by this type of attack.",
