            "answer": "Hello Dan & Welcome......I personally don't know if there are different nutritional needs for a dog w/Diabetes.....Maybe someone else can tell you.....What do you feed her, now?\u00a0\u00a0Has your Vet said that Sandra needs any kind of Special Diet because of Diabetes?If the Cushing Symptoms are from the Pred. use, taking her off the drug is suppose to reverse it...However, you CANNOT just stop the steroids.....This is VITAL!\u00a0\u00a0She would have to be weaned off (Very slowly) under a Vet's supervision, or it could send her into Addision's Disease which is the opposite of Cushings......That said: I understand wanting to cook for her......I don't think you have to be a \"Rocket Scientist\" to figure it out, but some people will make you think that! The Vitamin/Mineral component is the question...Is it right? The most important is the Calcium/Phosphorus Ratio. That's the trick...Meat Is the Phosphorus, but without bone, there's no calcium....So, calcium has to be supplied by another source.....And it has to be the right amount of meat for the amount of Calcium....Yes, it can be figured out, but it takes time.....Because of that, you may want to start with this:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are alot of premixes made that you add your own Protein source (Everything else including Vit., Minerals, Calcium, ect. are already in the mixes) You cook them up fresh daily & add your own Meat. They are already balanced, which sure makes it nice........I personally have two favorites that have been time tested at my house.\u00a0\u00a0;)Go to each of these sights and read everything there.....Sojourner Farms Foods-\u00a0\u00a0Sojos(Dot)com - If you order from their sight, the shipping is free...It will be on your porch in 3 days.....Dr. Harvey's - drharveys(dot)com - I buy this one elsewhere, but CAN be puchased from their sight.Both these companies have Reg. mixes and Vegetable mixes (Each are COMPLETE\u00a0\u00a0mixes on their own).....But, I buy both and mix them! You'll understand when you go look around.......Both sights have good info. for you......Boy, Sandra is going to be excited!!!!!\u00a0\u00a0If she is use to eating kibble, go very slow\u00a0\u00a0transitioning her onto either of these foods.....It will be different for her digestive system!Sojos will send you samples if you request them....I don't know about Dr. Harveys....All the treats, sold at either place, are wonderful & healthy, too...Good luck and happy reading.....Your gonna have fun!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Karla",

            "answer": "Dear MisfitsThank you for your response. I really apprecate it.This is all\u00a0\u00a0very confusing. She was diagnosed with diabetes in December 2009. She has a history of allergies hence the steroids. Our vet called the other day and after fairly extensive research he thnks that the cushings symptons are as a result of her extended use of steroids. He also believes that the diabetes may also be because of the steroids. I am takng her to\u00a0\u00a0him at the end of the month. I have to wait for my disability pay, that is why I'm only going to hm at the end of the month. In the meantime I am going to research the website you posted.Take care and thanks againDaniel",

    "question": "My 5 year old Bichon was diagnosed with diabetes in Nov 2009. She has been on steroids all her life to treat allergies. She is now displaying symptons of cushings. My vet is of the opinion that the prolonged use of the steroids is probably to blame. He also believes that what was first diagnosed as diabetes may also be related to the extensive steroid usage. I would like to change her diet and feed her home cooked food. I am sick of pumping chemicals into her. Can anyone offer me advice?",
