            "answer": "it's probably fluid retention. you are definitely not drinking enough (not even half of what you shoiuld be) and try avoid salty foods. people's weight fluctuates a lot during the day, so i wouldn't panic because of one or 2 day's measurement. i would think that kind of gain in one day is not gd but rather fluid retention. but overall, you really need to try to take better care of yourself or you will end up with gd or worse. i would just watch and make sure you don't continue to gain at that rate. if you gain more today, then call. don't expect to see those 2 lbs to go away by tomorrow.",

    "question": "HiI am 18w and I weigh myself every morning.\u00a0\u00a0My usual pattern is two pounds a week. I don't know why, but I tend to gain two pounds at once at the end of every week.\u00a0\u00a0Yesterday I had gained my two pounds and today I gained two more!!\u00a0\u00a0I know this is a sign of gestational diabetes, but could it be just plain water retention?\u00a0\u00a0Should I try drinking a lot of water today and call my dr in the morning if the two pounds don't go away?\u00a0\u00a0My ankles are not swollen, but my hands seem to be.\u00a0\u00a0I generally drink just water, but not a lot.\u00a0\u00a0I probably drink about 3-4 9 oz bottles of water a day plus I have a glass of skim milk and I eat a lot of fruit, which have a lot of juice in them.\u00a0\u00a0That's the extent of my fluid every day.\u00a0\u00a0I know its probably not enough, but I just don't feel thirsty.\u00a0\u00a0Yesterday I ate a small bag of chips that were very salty and we went out to dinner and I had beef tips that were soaked in a marinate and I am wondering if that marinate was salty as well I know a lot of them are.\u00a0\u00a0I also drank lemonade with my dinner instead of water. My weight gain itself has been somewhat rapid in general.\u00a0\u00a0I am 18w and if this extra two pounds this morning is just water I have gained 20 lbs, which worries me b/c three years ago I lost like 30 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0My whole adult life I have been 156 and higher and I finally for the first time in my life was even smaller than I was in high school!! I managed to keep it off for 3 years and actually right now I am at what was a normal weight for me before the weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0I am 36 yrs old and I know I am at higher risk for gestational diabetes and am worried about it. I have to admit I have not been eating very well.\u00a0\u00a0Allowing myself to eat all those things I restricted myself from when I had lost the weight so I know my weight gain is my own fault, but these two pounds this morning worry me!!!\u00a0\u00a0Has this ever happend to anyone and its just been water weight? I think I should drink lots of water today and see if that helps and if I don't lose the two pounds by tomorrow morning then call the dr and see what's going on.\u00a0\u00a0What do you think? Thanks!",
