    "question": "I went in for a scheduled c section on friday the 13th and had my little moose. My doctor was afraid my son was going to be really big, posing a risk of shoulder dystocia so we scheduled a c section. On june 13th at 951am, I gave birth to Anthony Nolan and he was 9lbs, 6ozs! Thank god I had the section lol. He had to stay in the nicu for 3 days because he couldn't regulate his blood sugar due to my gestational diabetes, but he got to come home yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0Now I'm having swelling issues in my arms and legs and have a swollen vein in my right arm, but Ant is doing great!",
