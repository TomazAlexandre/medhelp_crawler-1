I started having noticeable heart issues 9 months ago, my doctor said I have PVCs and not worry about. In the last month I have had 3 \"mini strokes\" which my doctor said is caused by blood clotting during the long period between beats. Needless to say I was a little upset this wasn't mentioned before it happened.",

            "answer": "First of all the published study you have mentioned is in the realm of research and not clinical practice. It needs replication, and then a deeper look into why these PVCs are present etc. This is far from causation (i.e. PVC cause stroke) but simply frequent PVCs were associated with slightly increased odds of stroke.If one looks at the the study result: the absolute risk in someone who is young without diabetes or hypertension is pretty low per year <0.1% at age 55years. Thus slight increase in relative risk though important scientifically in terms of further exploration has little relevance to you.Further, presence of PVCs during exercise may have different meaning than at rest and needs studying (PVCs typically get suppressed with increase in native heart rate).If someone is still circumspect about them and wishes to reduce ones' risk - conventional wisdom would work good. Have a healthy lifestyle, move, maintain healthy weight, and keep a good tab over other risk factors.",

This is also on the ahajournals.org and these are from 2009 and 2010. Has anyone heard this? My cardiologist did not even mention for me to take a baby aspirin or anything, so I am wondering. thanks so much.",
