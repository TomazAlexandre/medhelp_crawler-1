            "answer": "Hello,The target of 7 gives you an average blood sugar of about 170.\u00a0\u00a0This is higher than the level that you needed to get diagnosed with diabetes in the first place and is certainly far higher than a normal non diabetic blood sugar which is < 5.0.It is also known that diabetic complications can occur and become more likely as blood sugars exceed about 140.If you can achieve it without having lows, it would be more optimal if you can work to reduce your HBA1C closer to normal range.This can be done through reducing carb intake, increasing exercise, optimising weight, and meds, as appropriate.",
