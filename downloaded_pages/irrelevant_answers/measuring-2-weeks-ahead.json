    "question": "When I had my genetic screening ultrasound at 14 weeks my baby was measuring 2 weeks ahead in size.\u00a0\u00a0This was also the case when at my 20 week anatomy ultrasound when he measured 2 weeks ahead.I'm now 29weeks 5days.\u00a0\u00a0My fundal height is measuring 2\u00bd weeks ahead.Soooooo, this leads me to believe my baby will be born early, or GINORMOUS.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a bit nervous as I did not experience this with my previous three children.\u00a0\u00a0FYI, my ovulation/comception dates are not in question bc Ive been charting my cycles for years and we were actively TTC with ovulation test strips.\u00a0\u00a0So there is no way I have a 2 week conception discrepancy.\u00a0\u00a0I also do not have diabetes.Anyone else measuring ahead of schedule??",
