            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!If you are a smoker, then you need to curtail or give up smoking because smoking can slow down the healing process. Diabetes and hypothyroidism too slow down healing and must be investigated for. Repeated friction to the point should be avoided. Unapparent infection should be looked for by doing a swab culture.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
