            "answer": "I always have fears of having a miscarriage/stillborn. I happened to have moved basically to the middle of nowhere a few months before I got pregnant. I am wanting a home birth like I did with my first 2, but being 45 minutes away from a hospital if something were to go wrong really scares me. It also scares me that I live 2 hours away from my midwife (2 1/2 in traffic) so even if I wanted to have the baby at the birth center, I may not make it. My husband works 30-40 minutes away, then you think about getting kids ready and loaded and animals taken care of. On top of that, my first labor was 3hrs and 51mins from start to finish. So ya... Nervous to say the least!!",

She lived a month then passed away in my arms.
