    "question": "My husband age 59, has Diabetes and is insulin dependent. He has several annoying areas on the back of his neck and forearms that continually have open sores that will bleed then dry up and scab over. He has been on several antibiotics for this which work for a while then seem to lose their productivity. Is there any diet or other means than antibiotics to help this condition. Thanks",
