            "answer": "Hi. Thank you for your story. If you believe God to give you & your husband a child; then He will. God is not a liar. It is His will for us to have children. I don't know if you read the Bible, but read about faith. You can go to www.Biblegateway.com & type in \"faith\" in the keywords. Hebrews 11:1 says \" Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\" Also, read about a woman in the Bible, Hannah who was barren & was taunted by another woman (Peninnah) who were having children (read in 1 Samuel). Hannay prayed to God for a child & God blessed her to give birth to Samuel. Then God blessed her with other children. If you want a child, you have to believe. I have a friend who prayed & believe God to give her a daughter. She bought the baby's clothes years before she became pregnant. Well, her daughter (my goddaughter), Megan is now 5. She just finished pre k. She is my heart. She prays for me & it comes to pass. God promised me a daughter, then later a son. My daughter's name is Elizabeth Marie; God gave us the names. My son name will be Elijah. Again, God named him. God told me to buy my daughter clothes; which I have. I have started decorating her room. Again, God told me. I believe Him because God doesn't give us a promise that He won't keep. God keeps His Words. I am a believer. I pray for your faith. I also pray for your healing. Be blessed.",

    "question": "Hi! Im 46 years old overweight and never had child before and recently got married to a healthy 43 year old man.\u00a0\u00a0He wants us to have a baby I did tell him that I wish I could get pregrant and I did explain to him that with my blood pressure and diabetes it is impossible for me to be pregrant wiht my health condition and my age - it would be total impossible for us to have a normal health baby if I ever to get pregrant. We have yet to consult a doctor...We do love having a child of our own and we know the best solution is to adopt yet deep in my heart I do truly want a biological child. With faith in GOD nothing is impossible yet my faith and trust in GOD is so very shallow and my husband do love me and is so understanding about my condition and yet I just do sincerely need advise/suggestion.\u00a0\u00a0Please do help me..thank you GOD BLESS...",
