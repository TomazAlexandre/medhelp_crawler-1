            "answer": "What is your father's best corrected vision in each eye?First of all diabetes is a leading cause of poor vision in the United States. Second there is no \"minor diabetic retinopathy\" that is treated with laser. Minor DR is just observed. Major diabetic retinopathy is treated with the laser for proliferative retinopathy, diabetic macular edema and lipid leakage encroaching on the macula. So to put it in perspective he has significant DR.The description of your father's problem of good vision that then failed and varies is consident with swelling of the macula either due to the diabetes (diabetic macular edema) or as a very common complication of cataract surgery (cystoid macular edema).\u00a0\u00a0In the latter the problem often clears but in the diabetic it can persist.The diagnosis is made with macular OCT or fluorescene angiography. Treatment is with steroid drops and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drops (usually Acular). It that does not respond then steroids are sometimes injected around or even into the eye.You need to discuss the specifics of why the vision is not improving and ask specifically if he has macular edema that is not \"drying up\".You may want to see a second opinion with a retinal specialist Eye MD. Your ophthalmologist will probably be happy to refer you or you can also find one near you at www.aao.orgJCH III MD",

            "answer": "Hello Eric,\u00a0\u00a0It is possible that the increased IOP intraocular pressure may be due to steroids but it tends to get worse with continued use and I think you said his was better. It is not a good idea to stop the steroids without talking it over with one of his eye physicians.i would contact one of the ophthalmologists and ask if he has macular edema and if so what about using Acular drops as that is the drop of choice for macular edema.JCH III MD",

    "question": "My father, 65, had cataract surgery apx 2 months ago, each eye weeks apart.\u00a0\u00a0He was diagnosed with diabetes and it is firmly under control.\u00a0\u00a0This man has never been seriously ill, rarely visits the doc and until a friend gave him a blood sugar test and found it to be a little high, had no type of bp, cholesterol or other health issues.\u00a0\u00a0Upon seeing his high sugar, dad freaked, changed his eating habits and his doc is actually amazed that his sugar is now pretty normal, with minimal insulin tablets and no shots.I guess, due to the unknown diabetes, he developed cataracts.\u00a0\u00a0After his cataract surgery, initially, his vision improved greatly but then deteriorated over the next few weeks.\u00a0\u00a0He claims that some days he can see well and that other days everything is blurry.\u00a0\u00a0He doesn't have glaucoma but some minor diabetic retinopathy which was addressed with laser.\u00a0\u00a0There was some swelling in the back of each eye after his laser treatment.He has seen a specialist after the surgery who stated that this 'variable vision' complication occurred\u00a0\u00a0in 2% of surgeries.\u00a0\u00a0He also had some high pressure in his eyes which has subsided.Will his vision eventually 'even out' so that his eyesight returns to normal.\u00a0\u00a0He always wore glasses but had 20/20 in left eye and 20/30 in right eye immediately after surgery and he was elated at the improvement and possibility of not having to wear glasses.\u00a0\u00a0Since his vision has declined post-op and now taking some time to stabilize, he's been very depressed due to his impending driver's license renewal which he will not be able to pass.\u00a0\u00a0Any good news that I can glean from this forum would be greatly appreciated and may help to give him some hope that things will improve.\u00a0\u00a0His doctor says it may take a while but I'm beginning to doubt that his doc is giving us a straight answer.Thank you,Eric",
