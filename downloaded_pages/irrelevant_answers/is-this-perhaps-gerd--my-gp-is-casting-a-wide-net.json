            "answer": "The doc took a couple vials of blood and is checking thyroid, but I'm not sure if he's running a full panel or just the standard TSH levels, which may or may not be useful.\u00a0\u00a0Pretty sure he's not checking gall bladder, but I do know that exactly one year ago when I had right-side abdominal pain (and still do, periodically if I don't watch my diet for a few weeks) that was checked along with the rest of my lower digestive tract.\u00a0\u00a0=)I'm convinced that anxiety/stress is the root for most of what seems wrong with me, but we'll see...diabetes and thyroid are definitely on the table currently and I'm being tested for both.\u00a0\u00a0I sure seem to be able to see some correlation between eating and the symptoms (as in, they get better right after eating and slowly worsen until the next time I eat something).",

    "question": "I've struggled with heartburn for years (36 year old male) and am overweight.\u00a0\u00a0Former GP suggested I go on Prilosec OTC, once daily, and for the past 3-4 years I've been heartburn free.Recently, I've started to experience some symptoms which have driven me to my doctor again as a precaution:\u00a0\u00a0chest tightness, heavy feeling in center of chest, occasional flushed face, lump in throat when swallowing, sinus and ear fullness, occasional hoarseness or cough, slight fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor ran an ECG baseline which was normal, but my BP was quite high in the office.\u00a0\u00a0He put me on a BP medication and told me to double my dose of Prilosec OTC to 2 pills daily 30 minutes before my evening meal.\u00a0\u00a0He also is testing for diabetes and thyroid and isn't ruling out anxiety/stress as a trigger for all of this.\u00a0\u00a0Seems to be casting a pretty wide net for a first visit, but I guess I should be thankful that he's not just automatically throwing Xanax at me.\u00a0\u00a0:)Does this sound like it could be related to having reflux, mostly of the \"silent\" type where there is no heartburn sensation?\u00a0\u00a0I do wake up in the mornings a few days per week with that sour stomach acid taste in my mouth, which I have dismissed for years due to not having the burning sensation that I always associated with reflux before going on Prilosec.Any insight into the world of GERD is appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0I don't doubt that it could be related to reflux as my father and grandfather have struggled with esophagus pain and GERD as long as I can remember and there's no history of heart disease prior to age 80 in either side of my family.\u00a0\u00a0Both side, however, have reflux, thyroid, blood pressure and diabetes history.",
