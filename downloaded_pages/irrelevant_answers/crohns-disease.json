            "answer": "I was not familiar with \"Perianal Abscesses\" so I checked out a couple of sights.\u00a0\u00a0On one sight it did say that some people are more susceptible to perianal abscesses such as those that have:\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes, Aids or HIV, Crohn's or persons on medications that suppress the body's immune system, such as steroids (prednisone, methylprednisolone), or those undergoing chemotherapy for cancer ..........so I do not think that it is indictive of having Crohn's. The following is the website that I looked at:http://www.emedicinehealth.com/anal_abscess/page2_em.htmI have been operated on for an abscess (fistula) caused by my Crohn's disease,....after a hole perforated my bowel...and the abscess formed.....the way that my particular immune system looks after me......I had it drained.....I am now on a medication to prevent more....a medication called Purinethol:Has your sister had any ultra sounds or cat scans done to see if she had Crohn's disease?",
