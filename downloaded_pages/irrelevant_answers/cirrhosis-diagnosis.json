            "answer": "Hi Sismi. I'm so sorry to hear about your brother. It sounds like he is at stage 4 liver cirrhosis. It is good that they are monitoring him. That way his medications and diet will all be controlled. I have seen a person come out of it within a few months. With diabetes, it could take longer.The medications can help to bring his status under control. With time, he can stabilize. I know you would like him to come home earlier, but this level of care may be best in my opinion.xo Karen:)",

            "answer": "Hello,Once hepatic encephalopathy has developed, the prognosis is determined largely by other markers of liver failure, such as the levels of albumin (a protein produced by the liver), the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation, which relies on proteins produced in the liver), the presence of ascites and the level of bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin which is conjugated and excreted by the liver). With development is ascites, the prognosis is not good unfortunately.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "My brother has had 3 hospitalizations in 2 months. First was bleeding esophageal varices, second was paracentesis and third was hepatic encephalopathy and now on lactulose. He is also a diabetic so he has partial kidney failure at this point. He is unable to get out of bed without help and can only walk one or two steps.\u00a0\u00a0 His eyes are slightly jaundiced.\u00a0\u00a0He is in a nursing/rehab home at present.\u00a0\u00a0He has had paracentesis approximately once a week where 4 to 5 liters of fluid is removed. I haven't had any experience with cirrhosis and need anyone's opinion on how long my brother will be here.\u00a0\u00a0I know it's a dismal prognosis.",
