            "answer": "Hi baby,How are you feeling now?Your feeling of numbness on face could be part of your disease process.Nerve Root Pain - nerve root pinching / irritation / compression / trapping is always associated with signs of nerve dysfunction (not working properly) such as pain, tingling, numbness, and weakness.Any type of tingling, burning, severe pain, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. Your disease process appears to be more generalized.This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.It is your peripheral neuropathy which is causing similar symptoms on face.I think you need a complete physical examination from a neurologist to rule out any pathological state and reconsider the dose of VitB12.Hope this helps.Bye.",

            "answer": "Hi,I have had a workup from a neurologist and he is still not sure what it is. I also had a diabetes test and it was normal. Most of my body feels numb and tingly. I have trouble speaking, my speech is slow, like the words are okay but it takes me awhile to get them out. I'm seeing another neurologist for a second opinion. My speech was the first thing she noticed. She asked if I always spoke that way. I\u00a0\u00a0cannot walk on my heels at all. I can flex the right foot a little but not the left foot. Lights and sound can be very painful.\u00a0\u00a0If you stood in front of a parked car at night and someone turned on the bright lights and blew the horn continuosly, that is how light and sound feel to me. This happens mostly at night. This started to happen acouple of months ago. I know to anyone that hasn't gone thru this it sounds a little weird. I have a history of high blood pressure, four bulging discs, lower back, pinched nerves in back, and cervical discs out of place. And last some unspecified places on my brain that the radioligist said could be Ms but wasn't certain. I also have metabolic syndrome and sligtly elevated liver ensymes. I'm scared to lay down because I know i will get dizzy and will feel nausha and shocks down my spinal cord. The neuro is ordering another MRI but I guess I'm discouraged. My body feels like it's on fire and I'm beyond tired. I feel like there's something destroying my body but I can't get a diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Baby 119",
