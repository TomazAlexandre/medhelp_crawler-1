            "answer": "Hello, I am sorry to hear about this and glad to help.First get a copy of the biopsy reports, review each report carefully to see whether or not it indicates that each mast cell tumor was\"completely\" removed and that the \"margins\" are clean. If not, the few mast cells left simply regrow and form another tumor.Review your dogs diet carefully and consider the anti-cancer diet. Eliminating dietary carbohydrates is quite helpful to prevent and retard cancer cell growth and recurrence.Pet vitamin supplements that are natural and comprehensive can be very helpful to boost your dogs internal immunity and help her body to build resistance to disease, infection and cancer. Colostrum supplements are also a valid consideration.I am glad to review your dogs labs and discuss this further with you. Feel free to contact our veterinary office.Best Wishes,Dr Carol Osborne, DVM",
