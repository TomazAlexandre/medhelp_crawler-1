            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!A pain, tingling and numbness of this type can be due to two main causes. One is deep vein thrombosis\u2014can be diagnosed by duplex ultrasound or color dopplar. This you must get ruled out first as you have a family history. The other is pinched nerve or sciatica. This can be ruled out by MRI of lower spine.If both are ruled out then peripheral neuoropathy as is diabetes, hypothyroidism, and Lymes will have to be looked into.Take care!",

    "question": "I'm worried....I'm having tingling, numbness and an occasional needle like pain going down the back of my right leg. It affects my calf and the middle of my thigh as well. My feet have been tingling and have numbing sensations also. I'm scared because this is a sign of so many terrible things. I'm only 26 y/o. I have blood clots and aneurysms in my family history so of course I'm thinking the absolute worse. Can someone please tell me what to do??",
