            "answer": "If you are having daily bloating along with the nausea, and this has been going on for over a year now, you might want to read about a condition called gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0It basically is slowed emptying of the stomach (usually due to nerve damage) and it causes bloating, pain, nausea and vomiting.\u00a0\u00a0The causes of it are many and it is dxd on a gastric emptying scan in nuclear medicine.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it comes on after a bad viral or bacterial GI infection and is either transient or becomes a permanent condition, and sometimes it is linked to a neurologic and/or autoimmune disease (diabetes, lupus, scleroderma, thyroid disease, etc.).\u00a0\u00a0It is fairly common, especially if mild or moderate in form.\u00a0\u00a0Severe GP is usually a permanent condition.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, just something you might want to read more on.\u00a0\u00a0Plenty of info on the internet about it.",

    "question": "I have had problems since March of last year. I feel nauseated on a daily basis. I haven't vomitted due to the nausea, but the feeling is constant. The feeling worsens when I put pressure on my stomach (upper abdominal area). My appetite has decreased because of my nausea and it doesn't take much to feel full when I do eat. A doctor thought it may have been acid reflux and prescribed an ant-acid (pariet). Unfortunately, it did not help... any suggestions??",
