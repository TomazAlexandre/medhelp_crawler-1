            "answer": "Hi. You have pretty much already ruled out the possible causes I was thinking about as I was reading your message. I am assuming the vet checked for kidney problems, as well as infections? Dogs of this age can get slow-onset kidney issues, which would explain the excessive drinking - I rather feel that his urinating is more a secondary symptom of excessive drinking.Excessive drinking can be caused by so many physical and psychological issues, it is very hard to comment - particularly as you have already checked for diabetes, urinary infections, Cushings, etc.If you want to do some research yourself on the Net, try typing in Canine Polydipsia, which is the more medical term for excessive drinking in dogs. Something may just seem very familiar when you see other possible symptoms explained.One thing you might do is a) work out how much water your dog should be consuming in the average day; and b) measure the amount he actually drinks. You can then report back the results to your vet. The average dog needs 20-70 ml per pound of their body weight of water a day. You could therefore measure out a full bowl of water in the morning, then measure how much water has been consumed. Do this over 3 days and calculate an average. If it is more than the amount you should expect for the weight of your dog (calculated at 70ml per pound of body weight), then your suspicions about excessive drinking are confirmed.I'm assuming the vet has also ruled out high calcium levels in the blood results. High calcium levels will cause excessive thirst - and this will cause excessive drinking - which in turn will cause excessive urinating. If he has high calcium, it can be controlled relatively easily (probably through a change of diet, but take your vet's advice on this).Over-active and under-active adrenalin production can also cause excessive drinking. Again, this should have been explored in the blood results, but worth checking with your vet.Liver disease is also a possible cause, though if the vet has checked bloods for kidney function, they would (I assume) also have checked for this too.One last thought, wherever you live, what has the weather been like? It goes without saying that a change in the weather, particularly high levels of heat, can cause a dog to drink more. Equally, as your dog is now indoors more and has less freedom to go outside and get fresh air whenever he wants, the heat of your apartment might be an issue - particularly if you are controlling the environment with central heating and other forms of heating and/or air-conditioning.That's probably enough for you to think about for now. Perhaps you would come back and let me know your thoughts on the above, and anything else your vet might suggest. Once all other physical causes have been explored and eliminated, it may be this is a psychological and/or behavioral problem. We can perhaps discuss that more later on, if need be.Regards, Tony",

            "answer": "Welcome...The regular blood work your Vet took would have given some clues to Liver Disease, Kidney Disease & diabetes which ALL cause excessive drinking.....The first thing I thought of in a 10 year old dog was Hypothyroidism....To diagnose this, a special blood test has to be run....It also causes excessive drinking......If possible, try to get this ruled out.....Karla",

            "answer": "Hi Karla ... hope you are keeping well. Yes, Hypothyroidism was a concern I had thought of too, particularly as it could alter significantly the calcium levels, thus producing thirst. But with 3 visits to the vet and various examinations and bloodwork, I would have thought the vet would have discounted this quite early on. I think first off, texanbyheart needs to assess just how much her little girl is drinking and reassess the environment, as the latter seems like the only recent significant change, then go through the elimination process of symptoms v diseases ... and see what's discovered, or what remains after other things have been discounted. It's a tricky one, but not unfathomable I think. Tony",

    "question": "I have taken my chihuahua to the vet 3 times so far. He is 10 years old. He seems to be drinking more water than usual and has been wetting himself (more than a trickle) while napping. He does not wet himself at night though. His urine is concentrated at first mornings pee and diluted the rest of the day. The vet ran 3 urine cultures and blood tests as well. The vet ruled out Bladder infection, other infections, diabetes and cushings disease. I believe she is out of answers for us. She has asked that I track how much water he is consuming for the next 3 days and get back with her.I have not changed his diet and he has not gotten into anything but we did move from Colorado where we had a house with a yard and doggie door that he freely went in and out of to California and an apartment with no yard. He has never peed in the house since he was born and I take him out to pee 4-6 times a day. Could it be he is holding it to long?\u00a0\u00a0I'm looking for an answer or solution.",
