            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Excess protein in the urine is called as proteinuria and usually it is albumin that is lost through urine. Some protein is normal in the urine. A 24 hour estimation of protein loss in urine would be optimal to estimate the level of proteinuria.Conditions which can cause proteinuria are nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis, dehydration, collagen vascular diseases, strenuous exercises, diabetes mellitus, infections, multiple myeloma etc.I would suggest that you repeat the urine analysis again and take the opinion of your urologist to rule out the conditions mentioned above.All the best",
