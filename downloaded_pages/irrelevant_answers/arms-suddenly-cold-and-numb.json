Diabetic neuropathy could be the cause of your symptoms (but so could other things). Usually diabetic neuropathy occurs after long periods of time with high blood sugar. If you suspect diabetes, see your doctor for an A1C test",

    "question": "So for the last two months my arms (from elbow to wrists) would suddenly go cold and numb as if they were asleep. My hands and fingers would be warm but feel the same way, and on occasion my fingers will fall asleep. It lasts up to half an hour; as quickly as it comes it goes - with no warning. My arms will be warm again, as will my hands and fingers; numb/asleep feeling is gone.I also get a twitch in my lower eyelid (it alternates eyes) prior to this happening - usually for a full day beforehand. IT'S SOOOO ANNOYING!Help! I haven't had any spinal injury since I was 16 (I'm 25 now), and I've been pregnant twice. I've had surgery for a D&C once as well as having my tubes tied. All this was prior to February 2009.",
