            "answer": "They are Gona watch what you eat and you'll have to see what you're blood comes out each time after each meal.\u00a0\u00a0As long as you stay on the range you'll be fine.\u00a0\u00a0For example me, whatever j would eat, my blood would come to the highest 101 when I'm suppose to be lower than 25. It would frustrate me because I'm like umm not suppose to eat this but yet it does not affect me. My second ultrasound,\u00a0\u00a0he's weighing good. This is done so the baby won't be born extra weight or have diabetes when he grows up. But as long as you watch your food, more veggies,\u00a0\u00a0less carbs you'll be fine. My doctor seeing that my blood doesn't go high said that umm just failed the test because it means my body doesn't accept or do well when I intake that much sugar at once. They put you on this diet even though your body might do well with food just not sugar to make sure and not risk anything with the baby. Honestly I was depressed at first, but then it got easier to do especially because it's all for the baby. :) did this help??",

            "answer": "Honestly it's not so bad yes at first its overwhelming because all you keep thinking of is the bad stuff but once you meet with a specialist they will go over a diet plan with you and keep track of your sugar levels 4x a day. As long as you maintain it you'll be fine",
