I will redo the tests in the coming week and let you know what the tendency is => does the glucose level went down or up. What should I do in the meantime? How should I change my diet?",

    "question": "Hi,I have got a question concerning blood glucose level. Recently I had infectious mononucleosis and to reduce the fever I was given a medicine called glucim tabs, which contains whole glucan particle. It had been taking it for 2 weeks, 4 times a day. Than on the most recent tests I had a glucose level of 103 mg/dL. Could this have been influenced by the medicine I mentioned?Thank you for your answer in advanceThis discussion is related to/posts/show/677487.",
