            "answer": "Don't avoid it. If you think it's gonna make you gain weight or get gestational diabetes it won't. Your body gains weight as it wants and gestational is from hormones in the placenta. For both it'll either happen or not either way. Now don't go crazy and stuff your face but don't exactly limit it. If you want a candy bar get one you want ice\u00a0\u00a0cream get some. Don't eat like an entire cake or gallon of ice cream in one sitting since you'll probably end up feeling fat and sick but don't feel bad to indulge once in a while",
