Thats what I gained after treatment last time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I am pretty much normal of where I should be.\u00a0\u00a0Until of course I get rid of the excess skin I have everywhere.\u00a0\u00a0Then I may look too skinny..\u00a0\u00a0But time will tell if I can keep the weight off, and maintain my sugar at a normal level.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I wish you luck on treatment with diabetes, it definately was a challenge if I did not feel like eating when I first started, but as time went on, my sugar was normal anyway.. you should be fine, but just keep an eye on your levels and keep a log so you can show your doctor..",

            "answer": "This diabetes situation sounds serious and needs to be brought under control before starting tx. 300 fasting glucose is not an acceptable number. You need a diabetologist and frequent care/visits until you are stabilized.Get the urinary test stix for glucose, these must never be positive, it is a little thing that you can do to monitor for excessive deviations of glucose control. If the stix are neg it does not mean everything is ok.Glucophage/metformin affects glucose metabolism and insulin response in several ways, both in the liver as well as in the muscles.It increases glucose uptake by increasing availibility of the Glut4 insulin responsive transporter in muscle cells, thus increasing insulin response/sensitivity,it activates cellular kinases (phosphorylases) that mediate the effects of insulin, thereby increasing insulin sensitivity,it inhibits gluconeogenesis from protein in the liver by inhibiting a key enzyme in this pathway, this way lowering glucose production and levels,it inhibits complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, thus lowering excessive mitochondrial potential in case of high glucose in cells passivly overloaded with glucose in case of hyperglycemia.It has one dreaded potential side effect, that can be deadly : Lactic acidosis. Kidney function must be carefully checked, creatinine levels must be below 1.2 mg/dL and you cannot use it in case of severe hepatic insufficieny, since the liver has to normally use and remove/metabolize\u00a0\u00a0the excessive lactic acid that accumulates from anerobic muscle activity. Any crush diet must also be avoided, this is important because type II diabetics should get slim of course, but be very careful while on Metformin.Other than mild cases of type II diabetes, metformin should ideally be combined early with insulin shots, this is the healthiest way to treat type II diabetes, although most patients like the idea \" I can nicely control it with pills\" better. They are quite mistaken, the early use of insulin in this indication slows the loss of residual pancreatic function and also the use of the sulfonylurea insulin releasing drugs is accompanied by negative side effects on the heart and a more rapid progression of loss of beta cells due to excessive use of reserve insulin. You can whip a tired horse and it will run faster for a while, only to finally completely break down.",
