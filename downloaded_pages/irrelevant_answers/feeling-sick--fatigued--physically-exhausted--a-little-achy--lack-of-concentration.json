            "answer": "You do not say if your doctor has checked you out for diabetes.Virus problems can make you feel tired and out of sorts and can take a long time to start feeling well again.Would be worth getting your urine tested for any urinary tract infection.Stress, anxiety and depression can also give the symptoms you describe.Make sure you are eating a healthy diet, drink plenty of fluids so that you are not dehydrated (that can make the brain not function properly).Make sue also you are getting enough sleep.Perhaps a multi-vitamin may give you a little boost.Wishing you a speedy recovery.Best wishes",

    "question": "I am 24 years old and I have been going through some serious problems in the past month and a half.\u00a0\u00a0I have always felt tired and fatigued and I have always felt like I have had some trouble concentrating at school and at work, but things have recently gotten a lot worse.\u00a0\u00a0I moved to Houston temporarily about a month and a half ago and ever since I have been feeling very bad.\u00a0\u00a0It started with severe lack of concentration and fatigue at work, but it quickly developed into feeling physically bad also.\u00a0\u00a0I wake up feeling achy and slightly feverish with the sweats.\u00a0\u00a0That tends to go away once I get going, but I feel crummy throughout the day and have no energy during or after work.\u00a0\u00a0I can almost describe it like the beginning stages of a cold/fever/flu coming on, but it never does, and this feeling has lasted a month and a half.\u00a0\u00a0The biggest warning sign for me that something is actually physically wrong is that I have been unable to exercise or go for a run without feeling bad and having to stop.\u00a0\u00a0About 2 and \u00bd months ago I ran a half marathon at 7 and \u00bd minute miles and the week before I moved to Houston I ran a five mile run with a great time and felt fine after.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve always been able to workout and exercise despite my feeling tired.\u00a0\u00a0Now I cannot physically exert myself at all without feeling bad and getting a little achy and sweaty. I\u2019ve been to an Internist several times and have gotten blood work done for red blood cell count, liver/kidney function, vitamin B and D levels, thyroid hormone levels, celiacs disease, mono virus, lymes disease, and even went so far as to get an HIV test.\u00a0\u00a0All tests came back negative.\u00a0\u00a0The Doctor seems out of ideas.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m hoping this is a virus that will eventually blow over, but it\u2019s been going on for a month and a half, which is very concerning.\u00a0\u00a0Other symptoms that I experience on and off include dry mouth, thirst, loss of appetite, and trouble sleeping. I am thinking that it could be a locational thing as it started when I moved to Houston, but I haven\u2019t found anything in my research.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t think it\u2019s allergies because I don\u2019t have watery eyes/congestion/sinus issues.\u00a0\u00a0I went out drinking like I used to last weekend because I am sick and tired (no pun intended) of staying in and doing nothing.\u00a0\u00a0That did not end well.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",
