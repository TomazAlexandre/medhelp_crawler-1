            "answer": "Perhaps in time doctors will develope a HCV diet like diets that are geared toward people with other health issues. HCV mainly attacks the liver, with compromised liver function everything your body has to metabolize is compromised. Things you eat, meds, even odors(chemicals) are processed by the liver. Knowing this there has to be things we must avoid so we won't contribute to diabetes, heart disease, or anything else. Compromised liver function has also been known to contribute to high cholesterol levels, which leads to heart disease.It took me 25 years to get sick while drinking my weight in alcohol, those that catch it early will realize there are many things we can do to live a long healthy life.

            "answer": "Hi amommy, read your post with great interest. I have been a reactive hypoglycemic since the early-eighties (I think I contracted hep c in the late 70;s as a point of interest.) I have been through the ringer with this diagnosis. Many doctors have told me it is all in my head because my blood sugar readings on the glucose tolerance tests are in the normal range mostly, and I don't have diabetes (well, at least not yet knock wood.) There are different types of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) the most common, \"diabetic hypoclycemia\" happens when your body doesn't make enough insulin on it's own, (insulin is a substance that lowers blood sugar in the blood because youre blood sugar is too high when youre diabetic) and you have to take oral or injectible insulin to make up for this, and you perhaps inject too much insulin (which lowers your blood sugar too much.) This is the diabetic kind of hypoglycemia.The kind I have, reactive hypoglycemia, is less common and only in these last few years has been widely recognized. Seems that illnesses that can't be tested through common testing don't acquire a lot of validity until enough docs themselves come down with it, and there are so many, many patients that complain of the exact same symptoms...that they can't just write it off as mass hysteria, although a lot of docs still do, belive me, I have felt the frustration of trying to ask docs what is wrong with me??? and getting blown off... I finally went to a \"integrative specialist\" a doc who has an MD but still utilized alternative methods. He asked me to fill out a questionarre with what I eat for 3 weeks on it, and what times I eat it. When he looked at it he said, \"Says you don't even eat your first meal till the afternoon.\" I said, yeah, if I eat breakfast I get fat. He told me, \"well, youre gaining weight so easily because you put your body through a mini starvation, if you eat 6 or 7 small nutritional meals a day, you'll actually keep your weight down, and your panic attacks will go. Youre a reactive hypoglycemic.\"Well, I followed his advice even though it was soooo counter intuitive, and low and behold, my panic attacks were gone, 2 years of torture gone in a few weeks, and I could keep my weight down easily. This is one reason why I have a lot of faith in many integrative specialists, many are able to think outside of the box because they just don't blindly follow conventional medical doctrine. I paid big, big money to go to 3 Beverly Hills \"specialists\" over a years time and this guy is the only one that diagnosed me and helped me, without just handing me a bunch of valium. Many docs just have a \"pill for every ill\" type of treatment method.Now he also told me to stay away from sweets, simple sugars, and even keep my fruit down a little because of it's high sugar content, even though fruit is much better than simple sugar. To concentrate on veggies, etc. Eat a certain amount of carbs with a little protein, especially before and after I exercise (exercise can bring your sugar levels lower) and this has been my life since then. (A good snack is a multi-grain cracker with almond or peanut butter with a V-8 or some other kind of veggie juice, this can count as a meal.) Sometimes I forget to eat cause I'm so wrapped up in something, and pow, I get it, the feeling like I'm going to lose it, the shakes even if it goes too long without eating, all the symptoms of panic. Then I eat some protein, maybe nuts with a piece of goat cheese, or a meal, and I'm fine, I get this feeling of well being again.Now, what does cause me alarm is this thing I've read in the lit for these tx drugs. One thing it says that it can cause diabetes \"and\" hypoglycemia (opposite conditions though flip sides of the coin for some.) One woman I spoke to said she was like me, she had hypoglycemia for years, and once she went on the drugs, it lifted and she didn't have to eat as often and didn't get the shakes when she didn't, even though she still kept to the 6 meal a day thing. (Of course I'm hoping that happens to me.) Then others who say like you, that they develop hypoglycemia while on the drugs. This has me very, very concered, I don't see how I could handle being any more hypoglycemic than I am now. I know everyone is different, and it makes sense that their are blood sugar issues with the liver being the general of the hormones and pancreas.Also, it seems on my hormonal days on the first of the month, that my hypoglycemia gets even worse, so it seems to be tied in with menopausal issues with me as well. On these hep c flare-ups my hypoglycemia gets a little worse too, so I do have reason to believe it's tied in with the hep, it's anyone's guess, because the docs can only tell me so much, this area is not really studied like it should be. So I probably confused you more then answered any questions, but here is a good article on this...http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/hypoglycemia/there are also many good books on hypoglycemic diets (which are just foods that everyone should eat but prob don't, ha ha. As I said, for optimum good health, everyone should eat smaller, healther meals more frequently to keep your blood sugar levels constant.) Hope this helps...Stator, once again I was blown away with your sense of metaphor and description, I really think your metaphor for \"getting spritual\" (with the little boy on the beach) is publishable. (I'm an editor/writer of sorts, so I think I have some knowledge on this, though little.) Please write these things down (maybe even register that particular one so no one else could use it, it's easy, you just send it to the writer's guild to register it),\u00a0\u00a0apart from here, though we all enjoy them too I'm sure\u00a0\u00a0along with your other musings. Even if it doesn't get published, and you never know, I think you should be keeping these for posterity....",
