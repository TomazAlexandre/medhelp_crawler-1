            "answer": "It's very unlikely that you'd be borderline diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Normal fasting glucose is 100, and while you might have used some \"rushing\" to the pharmacy, I doubt it would have been enough to count.You should get a glucose testing kit from your pharmacy and test your blood sugar before you've eaten or done any physical activity, since activity can reduce blood sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0Test kits are not expensive.In order to be sure that you don't have a problem, you should make sure that you don't eat processed, sugary foods, or those with high carb count.",

            "answer": "hey barb thanks for the reply... well I got one for myself and after two hours after eating my sugar levels are usually 99-108... At another time i went to the health centre after a 12 hr fast an it was at 96. Is that normal too? My reason for this bout of paranoia is because i have been having tingling in my hands an feet sometimes n i mean sometimes about my body but mainly my limbs... kinda like pins n needles but they can sometimes be a bit itchy but nothing overbearing .... I checked my sugar at that time I was gettin it n it was at 92. I dont feel thirsty i can go a day without drinking actually and i live in a tropical country... just I urinate often these days... I've been really stressed lately about this whole diabetes thing n my mum thinks its just one of my hypochondriac bouts but its not.",

            "answer": "You're worrying about this too much.\u00a0\u00a0Any fasting blood sugar that's less than 100 is good.\u00a0\u00a0Blood sugars taken after you've eaten something sweet are less important, because it's normal for blood sugar to rise after you eat, especially, if you're eating sweet stuff.\u00a0\u00a0A blood sugar of 91, an hour after eating ice cream is awesome.Anything less than 120 is not considered diabetes, but do yourself a favor and stop eating so much sweet stuff.What makes you think you are diabetic?\u00a0\u00a0Do you have symptoms of diabetes?",

            "answer": "Hi, I will tell u from my own experience. I'm 30 now when I was 22 my dad would check my sugar he became a diabetic at 31 yrs old he is 63 now. My sugar would always be 90- 99. I still continued to eat sweets and carbs which turn into sugar. Last year I was diagnosed with insulin resistance/pre diabetic and PCOS. I had glucose drink test and first draw was 179 the second draw for insulin and glucose was over 190 it should have been dropping not rising. I was shocked I had gained 30 pounds in 6 months. The lab work cost me $950 with insurance. I went on strict diet got down to 150 in 2 months. I'm taking metformin which treats both problems. My dad and his 4 siblings and his dad are diabetics so I am prone to have it. I'm grateful I still have a fighting chance. If I was you I would watch what u eat only eat 30-40 grams a sugar a day. If u eat a lot of carbs one day stay away from sweets. Also weight and family history are huge factors. Try not to weigh over 170 I forgot what the waist line should be maybe 36. Weight around ur belly is a factor. I also had numbness in fingers and toes, urinate a lot at night, I would also notice that my vision would get a little blurry when I would eat a lot of carbs and sweets, I craved carbs and sweets. U r still young to set your mind to eat right have that one day a week where u splurge. I love the app my fitness pal and runtastic u can link them together. I don't want to scare you and make u worry but u do need to know 115 and 120 are elevated. We don't need to become diabetics u know how much that cost. Way less trips to the mall! Now that I'm on metformin the highest my sugar will get is 120 the lowest 82. I am very happy and feel the best when my sugar is 86 no higher than 90. My dad has to take insulin shot one in morning and at night plus a pill, he does really good at taking care of hisself he don't let his get over 170 he averages 150 now it has been 250. My aunt 400-600 not good! I feel sorry for the people that can't afford diabetic goods and meds.\u00a0\u00a0I wish u good luck, healthy eating habits and a joyful life!\u00a0\u00a0It's ok to worry just try not to stress u control ur life!",
