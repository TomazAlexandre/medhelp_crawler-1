            "answer": "Dear Granny60,As the parent of a teenage diabetic,\u00a0\u00a0not a doctor, I'm afraid I have no idea about such a complex mix of drugs. Hopefully someone in this forum will have some information to share at some point. But this is an issue for a medical professional. Does he see a good endocrinologist who can investigate the interactions of these various drugs?",

            "answer": "not at this point, we switched medical coverage and are having problems with finding doctors as well as coverage continuation for certain meds and supplies that is why he was switched from mobic to gabapentin, one costs 80+ the other only 13. We are sceptical of what doctors say and always try to find first hand from others their experience he was misdiagnosed twicw before he went into ketoacidosis and they figured out he was diabetic. So any info from people who live with diabetes is more useful than a doctors observations at times. And thanks for your reply.",

    "question": "husband was just switched from mobic to gabapentin for nueropathy symptoms he suffers from, he now is having extremely low glucose readings some don't even register on his meter. We need to know if it could be interaction between it and other meds he takes. Currently he takes humilin N&R, levoxyl, prevacid, and mild dose aspirin. He travels for work out of state and we are afraid of him going into a diabetic episode with no one around to give assistance if he goes to low to handle himself? Is there any knowledge of problems with this combination of drugs?",
