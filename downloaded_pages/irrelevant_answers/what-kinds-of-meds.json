            "answer": "Weight gain, a change in metabolism and the potential of diabetes can occur with all atypical antipsychotics, Abilify Fanapt and Saphris having the least of that potential. Sometimes a change in diet can be helpful but it is a concern. As for eyelid twitching that can be from a temporary movement disorder such as akathesia or dystonia which can be treated with a side effect pill but make sure to call it to your psychiatrist's attention to rule out the potential of tardive dyskinesia which if they found they would then refer you to a movement disorders specialist and Clozaril is still a possibility as it will not cause tardive dyskinesia (if that were diagnosed Trazadzone can cause that as well google \"Patient Education Tardive Dyskinesia\", note the site itself says \"some of these medication can be medically neccessary\"). However, most probably it is some form of temporary movement disorder that can be treated with a side effect pill but do discuss that with them. Those two concerns are a potential for all current antipsychotics but as I've posted they are developing a new generation of antipsychotics in development that won't cause these side effects but in the meantime its a matter of keeping things adjusted so that you can tolerate temporary side effects, avoid long term side effects and remain stable in the meantime.",

            "answer": "Well, when I was on Abilify I didn't have eye twitching but I had sever anxiety attacks. I also couldn't sit still and was always tapping a leg or just \"figity\" but not like normal. Just moving all the time in such an abnormal way my family even noticed it. They took me off it due to this side effect and now I have to say I have bad reactions to it.",
