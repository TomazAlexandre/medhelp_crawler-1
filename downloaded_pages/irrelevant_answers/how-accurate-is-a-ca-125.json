    "question": "Hi,I am new to this since I desperately need some advice.\u00a0\u00a0Last SeptemberI had my annual gyn exam. A new doctor since my original one left the group. (I loved her.)\u00a0\u00a0This new doctor told me that she felt a fibroid and possibly a cyst on an ovary.\u00a0\u00a0I had to have a trans-vaginal ultrasound which I scheduled right away.\u00a0\u00a0It showed two small cysts on my left ovary. She also suggested I get a Ca-125 done and it was normal.\u00a0\u00a0She suggested I have surgery but I went and got a second opinion (found where my original doctor whom I loved went) and she said, no surgery... let's wait two months and have another ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0I waited, had the second one in November and the cyst shrunk down considerably. I was sooooooooooooo relieved. I just went to my regular doctor for my annual bloodwork and asked that she do a Ca-125 just for the heck of it.\u00a0\u00a0She agreed and I got a phone call two days ago saying that my Ca-125 went to 50.\u00a0\u00a0I totally freaked out... crying and crying.\u00a0\u00a0 I couldn't control myself.\u00a0\u00a0I cancelled all my plans for that night since I couldn't think straight.\u00a0\u00a0I called my gyn whom I love and she is away at a medical conference until Sept. 2nd.\u00a0\u00a0I was desperate so I called the other gyn and she got me in for another ultrasound on Friday.\u00a0\u00a0It is Sunday and I haven 't heard anything... I am so nervous.\u00a0\u00a0How accurate is this Ca-125 test????\u00a0\u00a0I've read that fibroids can cause this as well as endrometrisis (sp?).\u00a0\u00a0I was told previously that I have both conditions.\u00a0\u00a0No symptoms at all... I am 46 with no family history of anything but diabetes which I don't have, and I have totally regular periods.Any help would be sooooo very much appreciated.Ann",
