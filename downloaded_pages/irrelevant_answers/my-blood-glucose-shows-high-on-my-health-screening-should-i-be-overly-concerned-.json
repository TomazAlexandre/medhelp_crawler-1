            "answer": "Technically, this is indicative of prediabetes. This means that you are possibly on the path to developing type 2 diabetes. I would recommend an A1c test which evaluates your blood glucose over the past several months.

The practitioner will likely recommend lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise.",
