            "answer": "Hello bobcatpepper,I hear you have an eleven year old cat that has been diagnosed withdiabetes two months ago. Our cat, Sammie, who we adopted froma cat rescue shelter also had diabetes. Brief history of Sammie.When we adopted him in October 2011 he weighed 20 lbs. We broughthim to our vet. We had had another cat previous to Sammie, so wedecided to use that vet again as she is very good. Anyway, she toldus Sammie was obese and that he had to lose weight, so we wereadvised to feed him food which would make him lose weight. Wegave him this vet prescribed food for about 5 months. Sammie startedto lose a lot of weight. We( my husband and I ) were getting concernedbecause he was growing thinner and thinner. We brought Sammieto our vet. She examined him.\u00a0\u00a0Our vet suggested a blood test tosee what was going on. Why he was losing so much weight.Through the blood test it was determinded that Sammie had diabetes.To be honest, we were shocked as the cat rescue people hadn'tmentioned that he had diabetes. I called them. They told me thatSammie didn't have diabetes when he was up for adoption.Anyway, be that as it may, we decided to keep our sweet Sammieand deal with the diabetes. So the first step was to bring Sammieback to the vet for an overnight visit. The vet then started to determinehow many units of Lantus he needed. We started with 2 units of Lantusa day in the morning and at night. We were told to do this for a monthand then bring him in for a fructosamine test. After a month, we broughthim in again and the amount of Lantus was modified again. Our vetshowed us how to administer the insulin needle. Anyway , this continuedfor awhile. Sammie had a number of fructosamine tests. I must saythe whole time he was and still is eating special dry food for diabetic catsThe food is manufactured by Purina. Here's the amazing news.Sammie isn't diabetic anymore. His last fructosamine test confirmed thathe wasn't diabetic anymore. We were really happy and relieved forSammie too, of course. Sammie is still eating the Purina diabetic dryfood only a certain amount per day. We feed him regulated amountsdetermined by our vet several times a day. If you are concerned aboutthe amount of lantis he's receiving, the type of food he's eating orany other concern, I would go back to the vet and express yourconcerns. The best of luck to you and your kitty..",
