            "answer": "What does your GI who is treating you say?An ophthalmologist is no expert of hepatitis C or its treatment. Are they sure it is related to treatment?I would get another opinion before stopping as you have come to far.Were you treating for 24 or 48 weeks.\"5.5 Ophthalmologic DisordersRibavirin is used in combination therapy with alpha interferons. Decrease or loss of vision, retinopathy including macular edema, retinal artery or vein, thrombosis, retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots, optic neuritis, papilledema, and serous retinal detachment are induced or aggravated by treatment with alpha interferons. All patients should receive an eye examination at baseline. Patients with pre-existing ophthalmologic disorders (e.g., diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy) should receive periodic ophthalmologic exams during combination therapy with alpha interferon treatment. Any patient who develops ocular symptoms should receive a prompt and complete eye examination. Combination therapy with alpha interferons should be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmologic disorders.\"Good luck.Hector",

            "answer": "Some degree of cotton -wool; spots are seen in most patients using Inf. therapy and a certain degree of retinopathy has been observed(approx 36%), however rarely to the point of having problems upon cessation of treatment as well as having to stop therapy early.Seems diabetes and/or high BP plays a role .Hopefully you will be able to complete your treatmentBest..Willhttp://knol.google.com/k/retinal-complications-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-treatment#Abstract:Purpose: to demonstrate the retinal complications of interferon monotherapy and interferon plus ribavirin on patients with chronic hepatitis patients & Methods: 22 patients with chronic hepatitis C diagnosed by PCR were classified in to two groups. Group I which included 13 patients , 8 were not diabetic or hypertensive (Group Ia) and 5 patients were diabetic and/or hypertensive (Group Ib).\u00a0\u00a0Patients of this group were given Interferon alpha2b monotherapy for 24 weeks. Group II included 9 patients, 5 were not diabetic or hypertensive (Group IIa) and 4 patients were diabetic and/or hypertensive (Group IIb). Patients of this group were given interferon alpha2b plus ribavirin for 24 weeks. All patients were assessed at the end of weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 and every 4 weeks during the treatment. Opthalmological examination were carried out before the start of treatment and every month after initiation of treatment. RT-PCR was done after 24 weeks to detect responders and non responders to treatment.Results: The ocular examination during treatment period were normal except for the retinopathy. Retinopathy occurred in 8 of 22 patients with an overall percentage of 36%. Non-responders (7/8) were at increased risk of developing retinopathy. Non significant difference were present between interferon monotherapy and interferon plus ribavirin, while patients with diabetes and/or hypertension have shown a high frequency of retinopathy. The cotton wool spots were seen in all patients except one patient in group Ib who developed cotton wool spots and flame shaped haemorrhages at the posterior fundus. The retinopathy developed in some patients as unilateral (5/8) while in others (3/8) patients it was bilateral. All the patients were asymptomatic, and despite the retinopathy, subjective complaints have been uncommon, and visual acuity has not always been impaired. The retinopathy was noted 4 to 16 weeks after initiation of the treatment and disappeared in a 4-11 week period.\u00a0\u00a0The retinopathy disappeared in all patients who continued the treatment except one. At the end of 24 weeks, 4 out of selected patients were negative for HCV RNA by PCR ( 2 in each group).Conclusion: two weeks to 16 weeks after the start of therapy retinopathy develop in the form of cotton wool spots and retinal haemorrhage.\u00a0\u00a0The retinopathy disappears spontaneously during therapy or rapidly after stopping the therapy.\u00a0\u00a0Despite the retinopathy, most patients have had good visual acuity.\u00a0\u00a0In particular, patients with diabetes mellitus have shown a high frequency of development and progression of retinopathy during treatment. Patients should be examined before starting therapy to look for pre-existing retinopathy.\u00a0\u00a0If any is present, interferon should not be used or the patient should be monitored closely-for example monthly.\u00a0\u00a0If\u00a0\u00a0no retinopathy is present, less frequent examinations might be performed, such as at 3 months, unless the patient notes decreased vision.",
