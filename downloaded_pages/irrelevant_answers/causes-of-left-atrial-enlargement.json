            "answer": "I came across a happenstance.\u00a0\u00a0I was dx with Gerd in 1999 and was on zantac which after much time cleared up and zantac was stopped.\u00a0\u00a0Starting in 2001 I happened to get an SVT episode.\u00a0\u00a0In 2006 I had an afib episode and would have about 5 with each progressing year treated with verapamil \"pill in the pocket\".\u00a0\u00a0I have had diabetes that was diet and exercise controlled for 10 years and my A1C was getting a little high each year so I felt it was time for the Metformin which I requested from my doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I am now 59 years old.\u00a0\u00a0Upon starting the Metformin I was getting afib every day and was scared because I've never had it everyday.\u00a0\u00a0I immediately went to my doctor and he said \"Metformin doesn't cause that\".\u00a0\u00a0He referred me to my cardio.\u00a0\u00a0My cardio said \"Metformin doesn't cause that\".\u00a0\u00a0He gave me another echo which came out normal except for a few PACs....I also had a stress test done last year that was normal.......and he had me wear a holter monitor for 24 hours which, as everyone must know, when you wear it - nothing happens.....I continued to have the afib episodes and one night was so bloated with gas crying at 2:00 am because I didn't know what was wrong with me and I needed to get rest to get to work the next day but couldn't with the heart beating all different ways.....I went to my computer and looked up bloating, Metformin, afib.\u00a0\u00a0All signs pointed to GERD can cause afib.\u00a0\u00a0And Metformin can cause gas, bloating, digestive upset.\u00a0\u00a0The pieces of the puzzle were put together.\u00a0\u00a0I just happened to have gas-x in my bathroom and immediately took 2.\u00a0\u00a0Within one hour the gas and bloating were gone and so was the afib.\u00a0\u00a0I literally got on my knees and prayed that I was on the right path to health.\u00a0\u00a0I stopped the Metformin for a few days to give my stomach a rest and took zantac 300 twice a day.\u00a0\u00a0No palpitations or afib.\u00a0\u00a0I was amazed.\u00a0\u00a0I am now on Metformin ER (which has less side affects) and with it I take a zantac.\u00a0\u00a0I have had no afib.\u00a0\u00a0Either this is a miracle or GERD causes afib.\u00a0\u00a0I went to PubMed and confirmed it and here it is:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19911354I hope that I reach out to people who can benefit by my post.\u00a0\u00a0I know how you are suffering with afib and this could be the cause for many people (although not all).\u00a0\u00a0I am going to have an endoscopy done soon to see if there is anything else causing problems.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck to all those suffering from the dreaded afib - it is truly a nightmare.",

    "question": "I've recently been experiencing a dull pain over my left breast, fullness in chest and throat, heart palpatations, pain in the left shoulder and excessive belching. Although I have had many tests done, everything has pretty much come back normal. The only thing that the doctors could come up with was Superventricular Tachycardia. I think it may be more, but I'm not sure. Despite medications the symptoms still have not gone away. Does anyone have any suggestions? Has anyone experienced any of these symptoms?",
