            "answer": "If you are still gaining weight in spite of diet and exercise, you might want to have your doctor test you for some common health issues that can cause weight gain and/or inability to lose.I had this happen a couple of years ago when I, too, quit smoking and by the time I could get my doctor to believe that there was something wrong (besides the pernicious anemia, he had already dx'd), I'd gained 30 pounds, was dead tired all the time, my\u00a0\u00a0hair was falling out, etc.\u00a0\u00a0It turned out that I had hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\u00a0\u00a0Another issue that can cause inability to lose weight, is insulin resistance, which is the same as pre-diabetes.Because of the hard work I had put in, with no results (or actually gaining rather than losing, I got so discouraged that I pretty much gave up for a while, so I firmly believe that it's best to explore medical issues along with other things.You don't say how tall you are or what your weight is, but maybe 2000 calories/day is too much.\u00a0\u00a0As we age, our metabolism slows and we can gain weight on a lot less calories than it used to take and it's much harder to get rid of the weight, particularly if there are medical issues compounding the problem, as in my case............ trust me - I speak from experience!!Good luck............",
