            "answer": "there is always a reason for such a voracious appetite. is she on a good quality food preferably canned and NO grains. so she is getting all the protein and nutrients she requires. I ask just HOW MUCH FOOD ARE YOU GIVING HER? a 14 lbs cat needs alot to satisfy their hunger....I have one who is 11 lbs. and eats 13oz of good canned food daily...separated in 3 meals throughout the day, and that would be MINIMUM for a cat your size!!!- If that doesn't satisfy her than I would definitely take her to a clinic for investigation. an insatiable appetite can be a sign of Hyperthyroid disease or Diabetes.....is your kitty also extremely thirsty?\u2665Opus",

            "answer": "Hi thanks for your input. she has just been this way since the ceasarian.and she only eats kibble as she doesnt like wet food and hates human food. when i was giving her 1/4 cup of kibble she was this big. she is out of control huge. she was only thin when she got lost and was gone a month before I found her and she was again a lovely 3 kilos having been on the wild and apparently didnt know how to hunt. ( I adopted her and her sis when she was a week old as someone has poisened their mommy) so she was hand raised.she eats cat chow kibble (for indoor cats) as it is the only food she will eat for cats. have tried a lot of different others but she just wont eat. a vet also did an ultrasound on her as he was sure she had a tumor but she was in perfect health and is just fat! she is not extra thirsty I have always monitored that for diabetes checking. she is 2 years and 6 months old (yeah she was raped while i was at work as male cats got into my house and raped my girls and I ended up with 9 kittens and one of my cats died from giving birth. it was a horrible time!)",
