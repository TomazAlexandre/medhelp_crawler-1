            "answer": "Dear Carol:I am sorry to hear about your daughter's shingles.\u00a0\u00a0When a person has severe chicken pox, the number of viral particles remaining in the nerve is likely great.\u00a0\u00a0Under conditions of stress, whether that be emotional or physicial there is a chance that our immune system is compromised enough to allow the activation of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunatly, this is a life long worry.\u00a0\u00a0Most of the time, our immune system is able to prevent the re-activation of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0But when it is not, an outbreak can happen (not always, and the condition can vary from individual to individual).\u00a0\u00a0For instance, a child with asthma who requires steriods to keep his/her asthma in check is very prone to have outbreaks of shingles during times of stress.\u00a0\u00a0There are immundeficiencies that are inherited or acquired (such as mentioned above, or diabetes, or pregnancy) that can also predispose a person to have outbreads of shingles.\u00a0\u00a0Not knowing your daughter's medical history makes it difficult for me to tell you what tests to check for, but I am sure your pediatrician is very aware of what is happening and will do the appropriate testing.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

            "answer": "Dear Carol,I am not a medical doctor.\u00a0\u00a0But my daughter also had the shingles.\u00a0\u00a0When my daughter was one month old, her older sister had the chicken pox.\u00a0\u00a0My infant did not get the chicken pox and my pediatrician said it was probably due to the fact that I was breast feeding her.\u00a0\u00a0Then when she was three years old she had a week long bout of diarrhea and had lost a little weight.\u00a0\u00a0Immediatly following this she came down with a case of the shingles on her lower back.\u00a0\u00a0It was a dreadful time and she was in alot of pain.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, she is nine now and hasn't had another attack of shingles. Her pediatrician did a \"tine\" test (I'm not sure I'm spelling it right).\u00a0\u00a0But this test checks to see if your body is immune to chicken pox.\u00a0\u00a0She was immune.\u00a0\u00a0But if she wasn't immune, the doctor wanted to give her the chicken pox vaccine to keep her from getting shingles again.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps.Also, when she had the shingles, her pediatrician gave her a medicine that began with a Z (sorry I don't remember what is was called) but it helped clear up the shingles fast!!",

            "answer": "The medication is called Zovirax, or Acyclovir. I have the same problem, and I break out repeatedly every year. The Zovirax shortens the length of the outbreak for me, and it seems to decrease the severity of it if I catch it in the early stages.Sorry to hear that your daughter is having such a hard time. Has your pediatrician done any immunology tests?(IGg, IGm, etc.)",

    "question": "My daughter is 7 years old.\u00a0\u00a0She had chicken pox, a severe case when she was 9 months old.Last September, when she was 7, she came down with shingles, which was confirmed by a dermatoligist.\u00a0\u00a0The shingles started on her shoulder and ran down her arm with numerous clusters around her hand and even under her fingernails.This week she had another case of the shingles, this time on her face, confirmed by her pediatrician.My question is...This appears to be uncommon for children to have shingles, much less have shingles more than once.\u00a0\u00a0She is scheduled for her annual exam in April and I was wondering if any special tests should be done to figure out why she continues to have this.\u00a0\u00a0Reading the subject material on the internet makes me have concerns but I do not know where to go from here.\u00a0\u00a0Any input is appreciated.Thank\u00a0\u00a0you in advance.",
