            "answer": "Your number seem to be normal especially your A1C. This test is a picture of your blood sugar over a longer period of time. Your 4.8 indicates good long term levels. A fasting level- even though your's is good- can be affected by many things and a single high level is not indicative of anything. Your numbers are fine, dont worry.",
