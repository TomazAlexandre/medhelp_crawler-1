            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin without any rash on the body can be due to psoriasis, dermatitis, lice, scabies and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals, wool, soaps, cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Please take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "I have been itchy just over 10 years now. Have all the exact same symptoms as stated in the previous discussion (Itchy legs, no sign of rash or irritation). Although there is initially no rash, one does occur after scratching the itchy area, the skin raises up into red spot until it becomes just one big thick skin area.Now as you can imagine this drove me crazy just like everyone else states, until recently :)After several attempts at trying anything and everything I finallly decided to go back to the doctors after a really bad episode. She noticed I had just dyed me hair and went on to say it was a chemical found in hair and clothing dyes. The darker the clothing the more likely the reaction.She said I have what is called 'Allergic Contact Dermatitis'I went on to tell her I itch even when naked and haven't dyed my hair in ages. She told me that that was not the only cause and there are a few others and usually if a person reacts to one of the materials/chemicals they may also be prone to others.So she did a 'Nickel Test' This is where she taped a nickel onto my inner wrist, saying this is a very sensitive area. She said it may take up to two days for me to even have a reaction if any and if sweating or in areas of heat I may react more quickly.Well the piece of Nickel was on my wrist not even 5 mins and I had to rip it of because I felt a strong urge to scratch there. So I scratched and it spread, the doctor told me the substance sits in the pores of my skin and I am spreading it with every scratch.Understand what triggers my itch has helped me greatly. But avoiding them is not always possible so sometimes I still itch after contact etc, but my anti-histamnes work wonders because my body isnt using them every day and have more of an effect.There are other substances/chemicals/materials that may or may not affect an individual.Here is a link for a better understanding on 'Allergic Contact Dermatitis'http://www.aocd.org/skin/dermatologic_diseases/allergic_contact_d.htmlPS. Even little things like stepping onto a rubber bath mat after a shower can trigger it",

            "answer": "hi, well like others had posted, im also suffreing from the itchy skin. but its not my legs, its my left foot. its been going on almost daily for the last year, and its weird, since my husband has the same thing, and there are times where we get the itchy feeling at the same time. there is no rash, im not allergic to anything. ive asked about it the last time i went to the hospital but they said they see nothing wrong. ive tried using goldbond, and that relieves the itching a bit for that day. if i wear socks for more than 10 min, it also triggers the itching, but i wear socks like once a week, so i doubt thats the reason. everything ive looked up either says diabetes(which im 99% certain i dont have) or athletes foot(which i dont have either) this thing is driving me crazy, i know i shouldnt scratch it, but there are times i cant help it, and it is tearing up my skin on my foot. does anyone know what this is, or what i can do? do i just wait for it to go away, and why does my husband have it too? since he is military, there have been times he was thousands of miles away, and our feet started itching around the same time, so its not like we both stepped in something or were bitten by something. thanks..",
