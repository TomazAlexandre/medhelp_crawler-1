Keep your cholesterol levels - HDL & triglycerides - at normal levels too. High lipids and high glucose go hand-in-hand.Holly basil? Used in Thai cooking. Not proven to help with diabetes nor proven to lower blood glucose levels. There's lots of snake oil on the internet touting this and that cure but all unproven. Don't be a sucker for gimmick marketing ads. Exercise daily, maintain proper weight, and eat correct foods. These help the most to lower and maintain blood glucose levels.",

It is considered a precurser to diabetes and is an opportunity to make changes and to observe the results before it progresses. Many people aren't even aware they are pre-diabetic and don't find out until they are symptomatic. You ARE fine and I hope you stay that way, but since you posted on this board and sound like a person who takes good care of yourself and likes to have information I'm just presenting you with some food for thought. You could choose to not worry about it at this point and just keep it in mind in case your numbers rise. But if you have the antibodies for Type 1 diabetes (LADA) then that gives you a great deal of information about what to expect down the road and the need to be more proactive.",
