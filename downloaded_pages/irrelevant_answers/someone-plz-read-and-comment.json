            "answer": "To me,it seems that sadly, many Doctors are just dealers for all the drug companies.i too was told to take many different kinds of medications for different symptoms. But I didn't do it, I just kept demanding that we find what is wrong...and causing these things...what imbalance is there.i found it was my Thyroid...and not just low or hypo but Hastimoto!i am now feeling so much better with out all the other drugs and just my Thyroid medication. Many symptoms are gone.Please get a thyroid test of Free T 4 and Free T3 plus some others that this group may suggest.it sounds like you may be Hyper thyroid...but you need to check out the thyroid test first.Don't let Doctors get away with\u00a0\u00a0just giving you the drugs...make them find out why you have what is going on with you.Yes, I think it may be your thyroid...Mia",
