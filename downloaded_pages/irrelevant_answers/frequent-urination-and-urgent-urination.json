I would advise you to get a urine examination and fasting blood sugar and Hb A1 C test done.If diabetes is ruled out then other possibilities which need to be ruled out are interstitial cystitis, overactive bladder syndrome, neurological diseases, urinary incontinence, bladder cancer(rare) and bladder dysfunction .I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
