            "answer": "Unfortunately we humans tend to develop heart rhyth irregularities as be to into 60+ years of age.I don't know most of the medication you are on, but there is a bunch of them.\u00a0\u00a0Is there an anticoagulant in the list?I'm not saying I think you should be on a hard anticoagulant, like coumadin, but an aspirin a day might be a good idea to lower the risk of blood clot formation due to the driver of your irregularity...sounds suspiciously like atrial fibrillation, an aliment that comes and goes in many people.\u00a0\u00a0I have it full-time, or permanent, myself.\u00a0\u00a0I take a beta blocker (metoprolol) to keep my ventricle heart rate below 100 at rest, it also lowers blood pressure, so I suppose at least one of your medications is a BB.\u00a0\u00a0The BB doesn't stop my irregular HB, it just keeps the rate under \"control\".",
