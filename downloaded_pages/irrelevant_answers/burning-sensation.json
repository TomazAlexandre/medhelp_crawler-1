            "answer": "Hi!Burning sensation can be due to dry skin, hyperthyroid states, liver or gall bladder dysfunction, peripheral neuropathies (as in diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme\u2019s and lupus), pinched nerves, or decreased sweating as in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome.Fibromyalgia is another possibility. At localized points it can also be a sign of deep vein thrombosis, especially if it is in legs and thigh. This would need a comprehensive investigation.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps.

    "question": "I have had a burning sensation on my right thigh all day. It feels like my skin is burning. Is this something that I should consult my physician about? I have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and anemia. I take two types of thyroid medications, vitamin B12, vitamin E, and iron daily. Would this have anything to do with this feeling? It just started sometime today. Any idea what this could be or what has caused it?",
