            "answer": "I had those inner thigh cramps for years. Took plenty of vitamins and supplements ( magnesium, potassium etc.) ate banana's, drank plenty of water. Still had them. I had some good insurance for a few months and took care of some large varicose veins I had on same leg. I have not had a cramp since. I never knew the pooling of blood in this leg from the varicose veins contributed to my leg cramps, but apparently that was my culprit.",
