            "answer": "Hi,I am not sure what caused the odor--in severe diabetes that is not controlled, people can have an odd sweet smell that comes from ketones in the urine.\u00a0\u00a0There is also a higher tendency to develop yeast infections that may have a slight odor. I cannot guarantee this, but if it was truly from poorly controlled diabetes then your best bet is to keep your sugars well in check.Take care.",
