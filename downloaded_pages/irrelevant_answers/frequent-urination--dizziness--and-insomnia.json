            "answer": "I have CFS and I know that these symptoms are common with CFS --- probably fibro as well. Fibro patients' have pain though and CFS patients' have more fatigue -- sometimes heart palpitations, unrefreshing sleep, severe headaches, muscle aches, food intolerances, allergies, etc.You may want to check your son for diabetes -- just in case. And remember since he's so young, if he gets a diagnosis, it could cause problems with health insurance later on. I remember often being treated, but without a diagnosis. I think I know now why my physician didn't want to give me an official diagnosis.",

            "answer": "I have fibro and while insomnia is common with FMS I don't think the triad of symptoms your son quite fits the pattern of fms. Most of the time fibromyalgia is found in women, so to find fibromaygia in a teenage boy would be quite unusual. There are other symptoms such as fatigue, the specific tender points on the body, unrefreshing sleep and so forth. Frequent urination might be found in diabetes as the above poster mentioned...or in a bladder infection.\u00a0\u00a0 There are over 100 reasons for dizzy spells so one can't assume dizzyness to be fibromyagia without a work up. He could be having temporal lobe seziures, have an inner ear problem, silent migraines, etc. Best to take your son for a good work up with his symptoms.",

He tells me he has dizzy spells two or three times a day, and urinates somewhere between twelve and twenty times a day. He also has trouble getting to sleep and reaching a fulfilling sleep as well.
