            "answer": "Hi,As the mother of a type 1 diabetic and the wife of a type 2 diabetic, I can tell you one essential thing: type 1 and type 2 are NOT related. I am not a doctor, but I know enough to say that a 5-year-old who is not overweight is more-than-extremely-unlikely to have type 2. And the amount of sugar he eats will not cause diabetes. Type 1 results from a combination of genetics and getting some sort of virus that triggers the body's antibodies to attack the pancreas. Diet and body weight have no impact on whether this happens or not, as least as far as modern medicine knows. Type 2 comes from a combination of genetics and body weight/lack of exercise, and it appears in children only when they are extremely overweight.In general, a child with type 1 diabetes will present with high blood sugars: 250, 350, 500. Fortunately, this does not seem to be the case with your son.That said, if he has unusual thirst, it wouldn't hurt to tell your doctor. Maybe there's something going on. It's always smart to keep your doctor posted any time your child exhibits any unusual symptoms/behavior.Good luck. Hopefully he's just hungry and thirsty from being an active little boy. You can get him checked out to find out for sure.",

            "answer": "Thank you for explaining that to me a little more.\u00a0\u00a0I think I will still call his doctor to see what is going on, if anything.\u00a0\u00a0I think that he is just running around and getting thirsty and hungry.\u00a0\u00a0My mother though is freaking out and desperately wants him on a diabetic diet limiting almost all carbs and what little bit of sugar that he gets.\u00a0\u00a0I think its crazy and not really needed right now especially since he is so active and needs the energy from the carbs since he isn't overweight, but I'm a more laid back person.\u00a0\u00a0What should his blood sugar be right now at 5?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again!",

            "answer": "I was diagnosed with Type I Diabetes 41 years ago at age nine.\u00a0\u00a0I had excessive thirst with no other symptoms other than an occasional stomach ache.\u00a0\u00a0I was tested repeatedly for diabetes but my glucose levels were not high. Eventually my glucose levels rose and I was diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0This is not to say that your son may have Diabetes, but I would definitely consult with his Pediatrician to determine the cause of his thirst.",

            "answer": "Hello,I think your mother has a good point.\u00a0\u00a0Though I am not a doctor, I am a type 1 diabetic and have had it for 30 years, I am 31 years old.Typically, the first symptoms of juvenile diabetes or type one are,\u00a0\u00a0excessive thirst, frequent urination, and hunger.His blood sugars should be at a constant level and you will never find two doctors whom will agree what a good blood sugar level is.The amount of sugar in his diet will not stop nor increase his chances of getting diabetes.From what you are writing, it sounds like symptoms but, to be absolutely sure, take him to his pediatrician, they should be able to tell right away.",

    "question": "My son is 5 and I've been thinking that some of his symptoms are pointing to diabetes these days.\u00a0\u00a0Recently my mother (his maternal grandmother, if that makes a difference) was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes with sugars in the 500+ range, now under control.\u00a0\u00a0She has been staying with us a few weeks now so we tested my son's sugar in the morning before he ate.\u00a0\u00a0Last time it was 96 and today it was 113.\u00a0\u00a0He is constantly hungry and even worse with thirst.\u00a0\u00a0He drinks probably close to 2liters if not more water each day.\u00a0\u00a0He is only 5.\u00a0\u00a0He is not overweight, weighing only 43 pounds at 46inches, very slim and very muscular.\u00a0\u00a0He doesn't eat a lot of sugar and is really an all around healthy kid.\u00a0\u00a0After doing some research it seems as though this is still in the normal range but inching towards the prediabetes area.\u00a0\u00a0Is there anything that I can do to help him?\u00a0\u00a0Are his sugars too high?\u00a0\u00a0Should I take him to see the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0He had a bladder issue over the past 9 months and had urinalysis done monthly at the urologist office but there was no mention of sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Where do I go from here?\u00a0\u00a0I'm worried but don't know where to go from here.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your help!",
