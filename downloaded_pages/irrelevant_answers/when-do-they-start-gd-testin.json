            "answer": "I'm not sure if this is what they do everywhere, but at my last visit last week at 22 weeks, they gave me a little bottle of what looks like orange soda and a list of instructions on when to drink it (Before you go in for your visit, and then they will take a urine sample)..This is my second pregnancy, so I have done it before. It is fine, it doesn't taste that bad, but I had horrible heart burn w/ my first (and starting to get it bad w/ this one) and the drink gave me such a bad heart burnt that I was unable to finish the bottle, even though you are instructed to drink the entire bottle. The nurse told me it is done around 25/26 weeks.",

I kept sticking with mine because I thought he'd get better and start spending more time with me in the office and things have only gotten worse!Anywho....my GD test was done at 27 weeks. However, I do believe that they sstick your urine for it from the start.",

            "answer": "there is a couple varieties. the glucose challenge can be done sooner if they feel you are high risk for developing gd. the gtt is done at about 28 weeks and the 3 hour gtt is done asap if you fail the first gtt. at least that's what i made of what my doctor had to say. if you pass the glucose challenge or 1 hour gtt you don't have to do any other tests.i failed them all and am on insulin injections for the next 8 weeks :(",
