            "answer": "Normal fasting blood sugar is under 100; pre-diabetes is 100-125 and diabetes is 126 and over. Normal A1C (a test for average blood sugar over a couple month period) is under 5.7. 5.7-6.5 are pre-diabetes and 6.5 and over is diabetes.I would never accept an answer as vague as \"it's normal\"\u00a0\u00a0or \"don't worry\", especially if you are concerned about it. Always ask for the number. Many people are not diagnosed when they are pre-diabetes when this is, in fact, an excellent opportunity to make changes and delay or prevent development of diabetes.",
