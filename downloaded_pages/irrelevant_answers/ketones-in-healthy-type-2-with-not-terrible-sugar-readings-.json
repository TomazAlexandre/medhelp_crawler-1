            "answer": "Hello,If your sugars are going up to 160-250, and you cannot manage with diet and exercise, then you need to see your doctor and get on medications.\u00a0\u00a080 - 90 is a normal level and where you actually want to be for fasting / before meals.\u00a0\u00a0Maximum after eating should be ideally 140 or less.At 25 years old you have many years ahead of you and cannot afford to have such high blood sugars (it will cause many complications).Has your Dr tested to see if you really are type 2?\u00a0\u00a0You may actually be type 1.Are you normal weight or overweight?\u00a0\u00a0Do you have family history of diabetes?To manage blood sugar 'naturally' it is necessary to exercise frequently and combine aerobic and weight training (HIT may help), maintain 'normal' weight and eat a very low carb (moderate protein, high healthy fats) diet.\u00a0\u00a0If these are not working, then it will mean that your pancreas cannot put out enough insulin / insulin is not effective.First line medication to try (if you are indeed type 2) is Metformin / Glucophage.\u00a0\u00a0If you are really type 1 (autoimmune type), then insulin is the medication of choice.\u00a0\u00a0Basal-bolus (ie. combination of short and long acting insulin is the standard approach).To read up on the low carb approach\u00a0\u00a0you could look for the book \"Diabetes Solutions\" by Dr. Richard Bernstein.\u00a0\u00a0There are also many online low carb information.I don't think the binge drinking over the weekend is to blame (though binge drinking is certainly risky and not in line with your being holistic), but maybe your diabetes is progressing / getting worse.Please do see your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Please get back to us and let us know how you are going.",

    "question": "I am a type 2 diabetic! I recently have been struggling in terms of my ketone levels jumping up the the Moderate level while have my sugar being stuck between 160-250, I typically had had my sugar go down as far as 80-90, but now it never seems to go down, even if I dont eat or do anything. I am 25 and very confused. I also have binge drank a bit over the past weekend. I wonder if that is connected? I currently do not take any drugs, I am holistic.",
