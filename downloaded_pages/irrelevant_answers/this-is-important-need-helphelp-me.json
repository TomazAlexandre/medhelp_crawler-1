            "answer": "Your insulin needs will likely change as baby grows. You will likely have to test your blood sugar more frequently to make sure your sugars are staying well controlled. Many mothers with diabetes have perfectly healthy babies. Your doctor will be able to give you more information but basically what you need to do right now is take a deep breath. Stress isn't good for your body or the baby you're growing. Continue a healthy diet and drink plenty of water and get your rest. And your doctor will help you going forward from there.",

            "answer": "As long as you eat healthy and watch your weight gain you will be fine. The most common issue for diabetics is large babies, due to the amount of sugar they receive.\u00a0\u00a0Don't worry yourself anymore than necessary as that usually causes a rise in blood sugar as well. You will most likely be considered high risk, but I would try to relax.",

I was seeing my ob weekly while adjusting my diabetes meds (not insulin dependent yet, but may be later in pregnancy) I have just gone to every other week visits. I have had four scans to make sure baby is ok. I will start seeing a fetal specialist at 20 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I was told to be prepared for a c-section if baby is too large but for now planning a natural delivery.\u00a0\u00a0My best advice\u00a0\u00a0is try not to stress, check ur sugars often (especially if ur not feeling right) keep a good log to show your Dr. Trust your Dr work on a plan with him/her to control your sugars but don't freak if they get outta whack. Exercise daily dont over do it tho. Good luck...",
