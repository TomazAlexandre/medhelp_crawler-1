            "answer": "The testing for diabetes / risk of diabetes is a finger prick or regular blood tests.The testing is glucose tolerance test.If you are concerned you may also want to get a home glucose monitor (if you are in US you can get them reasonably priced from Wallmart), and monitor your fasting blood sugar first thing in the morning, and then 2 hours after eating from time to time.It is really important for a healthy pregnancy for you and the baby if you do catch diabetes early, on the odd chance you had it.Hope this helps.",
