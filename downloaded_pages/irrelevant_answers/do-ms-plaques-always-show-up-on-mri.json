            "answer": "Hi, Teri--Yes, the MRI can miss lesions, either because of too-low magnet strength or slices that are too thick. That said, heat can exacerbate neural-related problems, even without there being MS.\u00a0\u00a0What were the sequelae of your stroke in terms of disability? Are these symptoms you describe new, arising sometime after the stroke, or does your neuro think they are stroke related? How has your BP been since your stroke?Bio",

I fell in that episode and mri was done and just showed original lesion.\u00a0\u00a0Followed this with an EEG and found frequent seizures were occuring.\u00a0\u00a0I was put on seizure medicine and still hasn't sold my speech memory problem\u00a0\u00a0The shaking of my hands just started recently.My BP is good.\u00a0\u00a0Believe it or not ( I couldn't make this up) my stroke occurred April 06 and in September 06 I had aheart attack and quadruple bypass.\u00a0\u00a0My BP has been fine.My neuro thought these were stroke related until the results of the EEG.Now he's sending me to Univ of Penn to see another neuro who specializes in cognitive and other more specialized neuro problems.To be honest, I asked my neuro at this point maybe I should be seeing a psychiatrist.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I'm going crazy.\u00a0\u00a0I'm lucky my neuro is a good guy.Any thoughts please let me knowTeri",
