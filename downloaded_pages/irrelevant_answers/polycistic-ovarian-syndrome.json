            "answer": "I think you need to address each problem first. For example, can you take iron supplement for your anemia? Can you follow a diet for your diabetes? Can you take birth control to help with the policystic ovaries and depression? I have found that when I was on the pill, my hormones kind of balanced out a lot, so my mood swings were milder and my periods weren't as bad.",
