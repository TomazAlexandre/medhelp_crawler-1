            "answer": "Thank you for replying, I do have a neurologist, he has told me a few years ago that I had a TIA put me on plavix and aspirin, I went to him for l-sided pain, back, hip down the leg to foot, could barely walk on a daily basis, still having the same problems, after 2 years of cortisone shots, neurontin, lyricia,\u00a0\u00a0I stopped taking the plavix aspirin and everything else about 8 months ago, because nothing was working, I had enough.I even stopped going to see the neurologist, but my work to, had a lot to do with it also.\u00a0\u00a0I should of kept taking the aspirin though.I am seeing my family DR. now and he begged me to take the Plavix and aspirin, but still all of my tests are coming out negative, it gets very discouraging, because I want to know what is the problem, I just want an answer, I am going into a state of depression because of it.Thanks Tina (Draper1)",

    "question": "I am a 49 yr old female, who smokes, no Hypertension or diabetes, I have had all symptoms of Stroke/TIA, I had\u00a0\u00a0radiating pain down L arm, numbing/tingling up L side of face, profuse sweating, dizziness, I also had slight pain across jaw, no weakness though, this has happened more than one time, all of my test come out negative, is that normal for a TIA that nothing shows? I am afraid that when or if I have a stroke, that will be it since everything comes up negative.\u00a0\u00a0I also have Bradycardia could that mean anything. I am also very fatigued after this set of symptoms. Help.",
