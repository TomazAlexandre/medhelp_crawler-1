            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Finding the cause is very important for any treatment. You could be suffering from an inflammatory bowel condition such as Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/Irritable Bowel Syndrome/ Crohn\u2019s disease. Other than that it could be due to H pylori infection. It can also be food intolerance. Diabetes can cause slowing of gut and can cause bloating and hence get your blood sugar tested. It can also be due to excess consumption of food rich in sulfites like juices, molasses, yellow dye in ready made food stuffs, and red wine. Sulfites are present in lesser amounts in mashed potatoes made from dry powder, pickles, tinned shrimp, cookies, crackers, and readymade pie dough. Constipation can also cause bloating. Very sedentary lifestyle is another cause. Cancers of the gut and in female ovarian cancer too could be a cause.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

    "question": "I am healthy in normal times. but occassionally I have chronic stomach bloatedness. My stomach will be extremely tight and I have to reduce my food intake drastically to allow food to digest. When the attack comes, I will not be able to eat or drink at all and will vomit incessantly. Usually the episode last for at least 7-9 days. Stomach bloated in 1-3 days, follow by continuous vomitting for next 4-6 days. Afterwhich I will not be able to eat or drink normally as body reject it. Strangely the stomach will revert to function as before after the attack and I will be able to eat as before. Western medicine is not able to find cause or cure. Hope anyone who chance upon such encounter can share experience or referral of TCM /Holistic treatmentGreatly appreciate",
