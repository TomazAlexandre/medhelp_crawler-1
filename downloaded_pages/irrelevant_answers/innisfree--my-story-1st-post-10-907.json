I am glad that you finally saw someone who knows what they're talking about but more than 47 lesions?! I just hope that my new neuro will be as thorough and helpful as your neuro is now!Mel",

            "answer": "Thanks for sharing your story!\u00a0\u00a0I am so sorry it took so long for you to get a clear diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Your story reiterates the fact that alot of doctors out there just go with their original train of thought or someone elses diagnosis without actually taking the time and effort to figure us out.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like you have quite a few neuros to offer up to our Friday night weanie roast!My previous post sounded a bit neurotic, \"WOW 37 years!\", sorry!\u00a0\u00a0I am just amazed that there are so many of us out there with true medical problems and unable to find a doctor that wants to put the effort in to find a real diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure everyone of us here would be tested nonstop for 3 weeks if we thought it would bring results.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry I am venting again!You are an inspiration for those of us here who feel we cannot possibly go see another doctor!\u00a0\u00a0 I hope you can work your medication issues out.Take care and nice to meet you!!Kristin",

    "question": "My MS StoryMy MS story seems like it began yesterday and it seems like several lifetimes away. I think it is both. I remember being very young and having a feeling of pins and needles in my feet when I walked upon awakening. I thought everyone felt those sensations. Always an active child, there were few trees I could not climb. I had a wonderful childhood. Indeed, I have had a wonderful life.Then later, when I was 17, nearly 18, I started have odd sensations and symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I would suddenly have intense pain in my face and head to the point of dissociation, stiffening and numbness of my legs so that I needed to get to a chair or the floor. My aunt was a nurse at Chicago University Hospital and I went there for testing when I was nearer 20. They ran a gamut of tests\u2014although I think it is odd in retrospect that they did not do a lumber tap. They stated that I had a cerebral dysrhythmia.The episodes slowly stopped although the pain in my feet when first standing on them remained. When I started having babies beginning at age 24, the episodes ceased altogether.\u00a0\u00a0I had gestational diabetes with each pregnancy (4) which cleared with the births.The episodes returned when I was in my early 30\u2019s, but were very infrequent. I was divorced with four little ones and started doing Tae Kwon Do for stress relief. In my later 30\u2019s the episodes returned. Atthat time I had a wonderful family doctor who listened to me, sent me to a neurologist, who ran some tests. I do remember evoked potentials being part of those tests with no diagnosis. My family doctor suggested fibromyalgia.The symptoms worsened. My left foot would suddenly not work and I would fall. The pins and needles had eased by this time in my life. The wind on my face would sometimes make me cry with pain. I started having tinnitus.\u00a0\u00a0One night I was lying in bed and had a lightening bug stuck in my hair. I could see it in the edge of my vision, but couldn\u2019t get it out. Then I remembered it was fall. Not June, when lightening bugs fly. There was a dull pain, and I called my friend, an ophthalmologist, at home who said to see him first thing in the morning. That afternoon I was being seen by a specialist to rule out a detached retina. It wasn\u2019t. It also wasn\u2019t diagnosed.My family doctor had moved and my new family doctor sent me to another neurologist who found lesions, but ruled out MS based on the fact that I had pain. Everyone knows that MS doesn\u2019t cause pain. The new family doctor was impatient with me. I asked for a lumber puncture. He did it on his lunch hour at the hospital with his family waiting for him to get done so they could go have lunch. It was all of the horrible things that one reads about. I had an intense headache for 6 weeks. I suspect it was not accurately performed.Time passed. Life happened. I moved to a new city and a new doctor. I really liked him. He was kind and gentle and took time with clients to really know them. He was wonderful with my daughter who had a serious complication and his swift referral probably saved her life. It was a very stressful time and I began feeling bad. I felt very fuzzy headed at times. I got lost for extended times driving in familiar locations. I couldn\u2019t balance enough to do martial arts. He had me go to a new neurologist. The diagnosis was that I was malingering. I needed therapy. I was a hypochondriac. I was depressed.I said that I did not think those suggestions were valid. My family doctor believed me. It was wonderful to have his support even if we were left with nothing clear. He gave me some medications to help with symptoms. Then I moved out of state due to another highly stressful situation.\u00a0\u00a0In August. To Georgia. A place of beauty, and a place of heat.I went to a new doctor who diagnosed me with diabetes. She said that she could not understand why it had not been diagnosed before. She thought that some of my symptoms of pain might be from diabetic neuropathy but stated that was more likely with long standing diabetes. If the gestational diabetes had not subsided, then that would have made more sense. She asked for me to get my last records. When I asked my sister-in-law back in my home state about the whereabouts of my previous family doctor who I liked so much, was shocked. She said that he had beenconvicted of practicing medicine without a license!My symptoms were becoming overwhelming. I found myself grateful for all of the training I had in martial arts in falling safely! My new doctor referred me to another neurologist. He was older and took time to talk. He ran EMG that suggested nerve conduction problems. He ran a MRI and said that he found lesions in my brain and spine, but that they might just be from aging. He endorsed that idea that my pain was due to diabetic neuropathy with which he also dealt. He gave me tizanidine. I loved it. I had a modicum of relief.My family doctor moved; my neurologist retired. A new doctor referred me to a rheumatologist who found me clear of arthritic problems and she stated that she thought I needed a neurologist. I asked the nurse practitioner at work for a suggestion. Another co-worker heard about my plight and suggested that I go to one of her doctors at the MS Clinic of Atlanta. I had often thought that MS seemed a likely diagnosis; my reading and research pointed that direction so I was open to the thought and made an appointment.The neurologist gave me a neurology exam and stated that he did not feel that I had MS, but that he would order an MRI to rule it out and see if the test offered any information. The films were ready immediately and I went back in to see him. He bluntly (fine with me) told me he was mistaken, that I definitely had MS. He showed me the location of the lesions. We stopped counting at 47, I think. Since then I have started using a cane, a walker and a wheelchair at times when traversing long distances. Whatever keeps me going!I started on Avonex along with other symptomatic meds.\u00a0\u00a0I did not have much trouble doing the injections, but the after effects!!! At first I was sick for 6 days and then it eventually got done to 3-4 days of flu-like symptoms. I tried for 8 months before going to Rebif with no trouble. It seems to have started giving me problems in the last 2 weeks with flu-type feelings although it was only this morning before it struck me that it is likely medication related. My nurse practitioner and neurologist at the clinic supported stopping until my next check up in a few days. We will see what this next go around in this fascinating, frustrating illness has to offer/take.",
