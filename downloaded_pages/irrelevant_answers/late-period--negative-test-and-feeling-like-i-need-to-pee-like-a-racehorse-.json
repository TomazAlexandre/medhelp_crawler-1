            "answer": "Hello,Of course, pregnancy is the first possibility which needs to be ruled out. You need to confirm the pregnancy status by a serum Hcg test done rather than a urine for pregnancy test which is less specific than a blood test.Blood in urine and frequent urination can be due to kidney stones, inflammation of urinary tract and kidneys, diabetes, renal vein thrombosis, certain kidney tumors and polycystic kidney disease.To confirm the diagnosis, diagnostic tests that may be performed include Urinalysis, Urine culture, X-rays of the kidneys, Cystoscopy, IVP, blood sugar levels, Abdominal ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen.I sincerely hope that helps. Please do keep me posted. Kind regards.",

    "question": "So my period is late, and my nipples are sore though that may have been due to my bf. I am also under a ton of stress. I od'd on ibuprofen during this month taking about 14,000 mg (I went to the hospital and am getting help for that), when I also had sex, protected and the condoms didn't break. I have had to pee a lot but nothing not much if any comes out. I also took 2 pregnancy tests over a month after my last one, both coming up negative.. what could be wrong with me??",
