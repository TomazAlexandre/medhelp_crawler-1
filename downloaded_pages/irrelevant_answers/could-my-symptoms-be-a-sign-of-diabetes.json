            "answer": "Nalla, your symptoms are consistent with diabetes and one symptom in particular is concerning, your dizzy spells.\u00a0\u00a0I'm concerned that the level of blood sugar is very high if you are urinating every 30 minutes and you could be dehydrated causing you to be dizzy.\u00a0\u00a0Some people get so dehydrated that they faint and I'd hate for that to happen to you.\u00a0\u00a0Have a friend like your mom bring you to the ER right away for these symptoms, if you can't see your own doctor today.Enoch Choi, MD",

    "question": "Hi, For the past 3 weeks or so, I have been feeling really sick to my stomach, especialy when I haven't eaten. I'm hungry all the time and sometimes I don't feel full even after I have eaten a lot. I have headaches all the time. Been having dizzy spells, not fainting or anything like that. I'm peeing about every 30 min even when I don't have a lot to drink. I have no energy. No matter how much sleep I get, I always am tired. I feel like I need a nap during the day jus to make it through.And this morning I woke up and and kinda seeing double. I have to strain my eyes to get things back in focus. I have never had vission problems before. My uncle has type II diabetes. I am 28, 5' 7\" and 200 lbs. I used to excersise everyday, but 4 months ago I had a hyseterectomy and have been in too much pain to get back into it, and have gained a lot of wait sinse. I was talking with my mom and she mentioned that her brother (who has type II) has some of the symptoms that I'm complaining about. And she wants me to go to the hospital today to get my sugar levels checked. She is afraid that I'm going to go into a comma or something. Do my symptoms seem like diabetes, and does it call for a hospital visit? My mom kinda freaked me out. What do you all think? Or would it be ok to wait till next week to go in?",
