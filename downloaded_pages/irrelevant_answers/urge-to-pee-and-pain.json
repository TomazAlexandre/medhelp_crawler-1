            "answer": "Hi there. I have been having the same problem with people not answering my requests for help.Anyway, I`ll try to get you thinking, okay?You said that your urin has a strange odor, right? It sounds like you might have a Urinary-tract-infection. Do you have any burning sensations along with the odor? Is your urin cloudy or dark in color? If I were you I`d definetly get tested for a U.T.I. as well as for a stone. I hope I was of some help. Good luck to you my friend.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Strange odor in urine with increased frequency is seen in UTI and in diabetes. UTI including the STDs have been ruled out in your case. Then test for diabetes and see\u2014fasting blood sugar, two hours after food and glucose tolerance test. Diabetes insipidus too should be looked into.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
