            "answer": "Yes leeking is absolutely normal As a matter of fact I still do a bit (when its near my period time and my hormones are changing) And I never breast fed. Its hormonesYes I was wondering about your second test.Protein is meats,eggs, fish, nuts,cheese,beans(some)Baked beans are High in carbsCarbs are most defined as things with sugar,starch and flour in themFruits have natural sugars but do have to be limited, Veggies like salad are free although corn, peas, tomatoes, carrots have starches and sugars they are limited to once you begin your dietYou can eat a cow!! and a grass field!!The dietician will explain all of this and according to your weight etc..figure out a plan right for you..Til then just watch what you eat, even taking a smaller portion works,,Like I ate pizza\u00a0\u00a0Not 3 slices but maybe one with a salad.You will do fine and the good news is its over when its over",

            "answer": "hi there! i too had\u00a0\u00a0gestational diabetes. snacks i ate were cheese, and i also bought the Adkins low carb snack bars. I also ate fruit which did not seem to affect my sugar much but some people it does. the dietician told me to keep my snack carbs to 30 or below and eat protein with eat snack(such as cheese). i also ate popcorn alot. potatoes and bread were 2 things that really got me! it really isn't that bad once you get used to it and i lost around 17 pounds while pregnant :)! needless to say after i had him i stuffed my face with everything and gained it back :( i also had to stick my finger 3 times a day which did not hurt at all. Towards the end my #'s were so good that i only had to test 3 days a week. look up low carb foods and snacks online and it should give you some ideas as what to eat and not to eat. your dietician will give you a routine to go by. it is confusing at first by it gets easier. mine was totally controlled by diet and need no insulin. once i changed my eating habits my #'s were always great! good luck and if you have any questions feel free to ask because there have been a few of us on here with it.

    "question": "Good Morning LadiesI am 31 weeks and am leaking a little from my nipples. I am pretty sure that it is colostrum but am unsure of the color. It is yellowish. It is not a lot but every once in a while I notice it.Also I have posted about gestational diabetes. My numbers came back high normal. My second hour test came back 33 points higher than normal but everything else was fine. I go see a dietician next Tuesday but am wondering what to do in the meantime. Doc said to lower carbs but increase protein. I know the basics but what snacks are high in protein?ThanksEdye",
