            "answer": "Hi......high blood fat (high cholesterol) can be helped with diet, exercise and medication. Prediabetes is a great opportunity to change your diet and start exercising to prevent yourself from developing full blown diabetes. There is help for depression via medication and therapy, and I don't know if you've tried either of these.\u00a0\u00a0There are many of us working with a herniated disc, but I know they can cause a lot of problems.\u00a0\u00a0It seems like almost everyone I know has a herniated disc and they continue to work and enjoy the things they always have.\u00a0\u00a0But everyone's different, and without your doctors help it's going to be difficult to get disability.\u00a0\u00a0I would get a disability attorney to help you, they don't charge unless they get you on disability and then they take a part of the past due amount that you receive.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you all the best with this.",
