            "answer": "Smith,Thanks for the question.Assuming that \"lots of cream\" does not mean 1/2 gallon, then the cream might have raised the triglycerides a little, 20 -40 points, but not to 650.This type of profile raises the question of a spurious reading.\u00a0\u00a0Usually, patients who have triglycerides this high will have much higher cholesterol levels.\u00a0\u00a0Check to make sure that the triglyceride level reported was accurate.\u00a0\u00a0If it was accurate, then you would be well advised to see a specialist in cholesterol management. A triglyceride level of 650 is extremely elevated and potentially harmful.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Thank You,I was reading the material she left us and the fasting it says should have been 9-12 hours, she told us not to eat or drink after midnight and she did the test at 7:30 AM. We usually eat a late dinner and it was probably about 8:30Pm when we ate, and I also had a handful of raisinetts about 11:30. I am concerned about this.",

            "answer": "Get checked for diabetes.Yes, a level of 103 is normal, even for fasting. But with such high triglycerides, you may have insulin resistance, which can eventually result in pancreatic beta cell failure (which is what type 2 diabetes really is). You could even be diabetic now (a GTT showing a 2 HR glucose >=200 is diagnostic even with normal fasting glucose - this does happen sometimes). Even though the normal range is 70-110 for fasting, anything over 90 is probably indicative of insulin resistance. I had a 95 and had IGT (impaired glucose tolerance) and the insulin resistance caused hyperinsulinemia, which basically fried my endocrine system. Now its 81, and that is much better (endocrine system still fried though). At least I'm not diabetic and not heading there (for now).Once you become diabetic it is for life, and it can make you lose sensation, lose sight, lose limbs, become impotent if a man, become unable to lubricate (get wet) or enjoy sex if a woman, need a kidney transplant, constantly pass out and constantly vomit and have diarrhea in the middle of the night from autonomic neuropathy, constantly have to deal with frequent infections that won't go away and sores which instead of healing, grown into ever larger ulcers. Heart disease seems almost merciful in comparison.Have your doctor run a glucose tolerance test. Fasting >= 126 or 2HR >=200 is diabetes. If not diabetic, Fasting >= 110 or 2HR >= 140 is IGT. Fasting >= 110 is IFG (impaired fasting glucose).Or if he won't go to www.questest.com and look at the diabetes screen test they offer and get that. Then if that is abnormal, give that to your doctor.I'd also strongly suggest aerobic exercise *AFTER YOU HAVE GOTTEN A DOCTOR'S APPROVAL AND AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN CHECKED FOR DIABETES*. Diabetes contraindicates some types and intensities of exercise.Disclaimer: Not a doctor, just a patient. Wish I knew what I know 10 years ago - wouldn't need so many meds to not feel like crud and/or have a BP so high it blows an artery or causes heart failure.And I've seen some of what diabetes can do to people...",

    "question": "I had a blood profile done this morning and my TC was 165 my GLU was 103 but my TRG was greater than 650. I did fast but this morning when I got up i forgot and had a large cup of coffee with lots of cream and sweet and low. Would this have made my TRG this high?",
