            "answer": "Hello dear and welcome to the medhelp forum. You need to consult a neurologist for complete clinical evaluation and MRI spine to check for any causes for nerve injury in the neck or the back, herniated cervical or lumbar discs, which could compress the exiting nerve roots. Systemic diseases like diabetes, hypothyroidism need to be evaluated and ruled out. Blood tests to check for electrolyte levels like calcium, potassium and sodium is important. Management would be according to the diagnosis. Wishing you all the best.",
