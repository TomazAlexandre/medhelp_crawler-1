            "answer": "Hello,Hypoglycemia means she is going low.\u00a0\u00a0But she is going high.\u00a0\u00a0This could possibly be a precursor to her developing Type 1 diabetes.Did they do a Hba1c?Can you request a referral to a pediatric endocrinologist.Assuming she is having problems with lows as well as highs, it will be important for her to eat regularly.\u00a0\u00a0Meals should include fat and protein in every meal as this will help stabilize blood sugars.Be careful about sweets and very carby foods (not too much), as these can cause high blood sugars followed by rebound lows.Would recommend you read up on diabetes and it's management, as it will be important to monitor this closely.",
