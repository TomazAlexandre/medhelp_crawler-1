    "question": "Hi, my Mom recently was complaining about blurry vision and seeing black bugs! I took her to the eye doctor and they referred her to a retina specialist. Apparently, she has bleeding in both eyes. One eye is so bad that the blood formed scar tissue and she'll never be able to see properly out of that eye. The doctor wants to do laser surgery on the other eye to prevent further damage. She is scheduled for that next week. I was wondering if that will help her blurry vision or not? I couldn't really ask the doctor- they are so busy, they are the only specialists in my area. I know it will prevent further damage. Will the procedure hurt, is this a hereditary thing? Do I have a chance of getting it? She doesn't have high blood pressure, or diabetes. She is a heavy smoker, and is 70 years old. The doctor said she pretty much had an anurism in her eye and it does increase her chances for an anurism to occur somewhere else! I am worried. Thanks for your help.",
