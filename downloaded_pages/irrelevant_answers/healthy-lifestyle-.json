I add a lemon to one of my water bottles every morning, or I squeeze the juice of two lemons and drink it alone. I still have a horrible diet, which is my main concern",

            "answer": "It's not that I don't like the diet, it's that it doesn't exist -- the diet cited as Mediterranean isn't, as I keep repeating, there are different cultures all along the area and they don't eat the same but all tend to eat healthier than Americans do.\u00a0\u00a0But it's not a diet, and there are some problems in it, such as an extreme abundance of nightshades and so a lot of arthritis.\u00a0\u00a0That's why they did the nightshade studies in Italy -- the Mediterranean Diet.\u00a0\u00a0My point is that this diet might be fine for some people and not for others -- the biggest difference between us is you tend to generalize from websites that are really selling something and I tend to take a more individualized approach, meaning what's good for one isn't necessarily good for another.\u00a0\u00a0I just think it's best to borrow what's best from all cultures rather than focus in on something that's currently getting a lot of publicity but probably will fade from popularity as all diets do, but the general principles stay the same over time.\u00a0\u00a0That's why I always tell people to find the diet that suits them, not a generalization of any kind.",

            "answer": "Thanks so much for your advice....I'm mainly confused about what foods to stay away from. I guess I could google, but that doesn't give me much insight either. My doctor only advised me against becoming a vegan. He said there are other ways to maintain good health without doing so. Should I be avoiding breads, cheese, starch, pasta? Should I avoid sugar all together? I spoke to a nutrition before when I was younger that told me that eating an apple and orange everyday is not harmful. Actually told me green apples are good for maintaining sugar levels...not sure the correct terminology for that. Now I should avoid fruits? I'm underweight for my height and age, so I was told. In excellent health. I work out and burn a lot of calories daily with two rest days.I guess I am mainly looking for what foods to avoid, cut out of my eating habits. Very self disciplined, I've already cut back on junk food and plan on eating sweets/candy maybe once twice a month until I can cut them out completely.",

    "question": "I'm a female in my 20s. I really want to improve my health. I'm not unhealthy but I want to start eating right so that I can remain healthy as I get older. I weigh around 116. What should I be eating to make sure my heart rate, blood pressure, and cholesterol are in excellent conditions? I would also like to avoid foods that lead to diabetes. I'm not familiar at all with eating properly, or a healthy diet. My last doctors visit was really good, all my stats were great, but I know I eat a lot of junk food. My eating habits are terrible, so I'm surprised that I have been able to maintain good health. My dad had diabetes and was slim just like me when he was younger. I thought about becoming a vegan, but my doctor recommended against it.",
