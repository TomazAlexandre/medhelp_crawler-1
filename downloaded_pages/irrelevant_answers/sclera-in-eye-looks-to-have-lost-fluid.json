            "answer": "I would definitely recommend having this checked out.\u00a0\u00a0Smoking and alcohol both can cause your body to lose fluids. It is possible that you are diabetic and it will cause fluid loss of the eye.\u00a0\u00a0 If there are no other symptoms I doubt it is a stroke but it is possibly something more like malnutrition, dehydration, diabetes or an infection of that eye that is more likely the source.Hope This Helps. Good Luck",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Please consult an eye specialist. Dry eye is the commonest cause for this. If the inner eye is dry, there will always be a need to wipe the area and it will feel scratchy and gritty, as though there is something crusty there.\u00a0\u00a0It can also be seen in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. Another possibility is blepharitis. In this at times the inner aspect of eyelid is inflamed and it gives similar sensation to one you are feeling. Vernal or allergic keratoconjunctivitis is another possibility. The allergic reaction can be to soaps, shampoos, eye cosmetics or anything else. Wash your eyes well with clean water. Blink it several times a day. Consult an eye specialist as this is not something that can be diagnosed on net.Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "I woke up this morning with the sensation that I had something in my right eye. After looking at it in the mirror I found that was not the case. The white part/skin of the eye looks like it had lost fluid and much like that of a excess skin was gathering in the corners of my eye. It's rubbing against the eyelid and causing me discomfort as well as concern. I was told that it could be a sign of a stroke. I am 34 years old female, I smoke heavily, and consume approx. 3 drinks a night. I have extremely prominant history of cancer in my family, as well as almost EVERYTHING you would hope NOT to have. I can say that I have been going to thru extreme stress with a divorce. I have been told this could be a sign of a stroke. I don't have insurance at the time but would like to know if this is something that I should go to the emergency room with. Any advice would be appreciated.A.A.",
