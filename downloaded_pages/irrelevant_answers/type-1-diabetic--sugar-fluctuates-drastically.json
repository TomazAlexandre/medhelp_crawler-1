            "answer": "Hi Ruchika,I remember how frustrated and worried I felt when I was first diagnosed as a Type I diabetic about 13 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0In the beginning, everything is particularly confusing as your body is adjusting mentally and physically to the newness of being diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0But, please take heart! With proper care and a competent doctor or medical team you trust, you will be able to adjust and live a happy and healthy life with your family.\u00a0\u00a0The downside is, in the beginning (and perhaps at different phases in your life) you spend some time trying to figure out your how much insulin your body needs and what type of diet and exercise schedule will work for you.\u00a0\u00a0All these things combined take some fine-tuning, but it is not impossible, it just requires some attention and patience.I\"m not a doctor so I can't tell you what dose or type of insulin to take.\u00a0\u00a0No one here can either, but we can offer advice about how we've learned to listen to our bodies and make our own adjustments.\u00a0\u00a0For example, you said that after taking your morning insulin and eating breakfast that your blood sugar level fell.\u00a0\u00a0That tells me that your morning dose of insulin is either too high or perhaps you're eating a very light breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0If you already eat a substancial breakfast and your blood sugar is falling afterwards, the insulin dose is probably too high and you definitely need to tell your doctor these patterns.\u00a0\u00a0You might already be writing down the your blood sugar levels with the time checked plus any hypoglycemic episodes in a notebook, but if you haven't started doing so already, this is going to a very handy tool that helps your doctor figure out how to find the best dose of insulin for you and your schedule.\u00a0\u00a0If you are eating a very light breakfast, you could think about making it a more substancial meal and see if that helps keeps your blood sugar stabilize throughout late morning and into lunchtime.\u00a0\u00a0Another reason your blood sugar might be falling is if you're very active during this time of day, which means that once again, your doctor either needs to lower the dose of insulin or you need to have some carbohydrates from breakfast helping you along the way.I know I keep saying \"your doctor can change the dose\" a lot, but this is because your diabetes is so new.\u00a0\u00a0Once you feel a bit more comfortable with the whole thing, your doctor can teach you a way to adjust the insulin yourself by either lowering or increasing the insulin in small doses based on the patterns of your blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Still, regular consultations with a good doctor, preferably a specialist, are a must!Once again, please take heart! What you're going through has happened to us all, it's definitely a balancing act that we learn with practice.\u00a0\u00a0There's no reason to be scared that you won't have a good quality of life, but do find a doctor you trust because the sooner you can get those blood sugar levels under control, the better you'll feel.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, be patient with yourself as you'll probably need a few weeks to find the right routine, dose of insulin etc. that works for\u00a0\u00a0you.\u00a0\u00a0I hope your family is being supportive, please reassure them that you'll be fine but that you must be attentive and patient.\u00a0\u00a0Please keep us informed of your progress! Wish you all the best!!!",

            "answer": "Take everything you hear with a grain of salt, but I think drastic sugar fluctuations are pretty normal when starting out with the disease. Of course, I wouldn't really know since I was 2 years old when I was diagnosed. However, as you age and change your daily life patterns, things change and you can always be confronted with rollercoaster rides of glucose levels. What's important is to be on top of it. Doctors are good for a while, but--in my somewhat cynical view--nobody other than yourself will ever better be able to know your condition: a non-diabetic doctor will never be able to truly understand the disease, and other diabetics will never be you.In your particular case, I am first concerned that you say you take Amaryl. If in fact you are a type 1 diabetic, you should not be taking Amaryl. I would say to find yourself a new doctor if he/she thinks that Amaryl is appropriate for juvenile diabetes. But, perhaps there is something I don't know.Otherwise, just cautiously play with your carbohydrate intake and your insulin dosages. Yes, I agree that a doctor should be consulted about this at first, but eventually you should be running the show. If the cost of blood strips is not too much of an issue, test yourself every hour. Note how insulin works on you. Everyone absorbs it at a slightly different rate. Note how carbohydrates affect your sugar. Learn what foods are made of. You need an insulin carbohydrate ratio. This way you can balance your food/insulin intake.There are countless little things you will discover on your own. Years ago, I asked my dietitian, for example, if coffee had an impact on sugar levels. She said \"no, it has no calories, but be careful about the milk you add to it\". Of course, as it turns out she was not fully informed. I knew that coffee made my sugar go up slightly, regardless of what was added to it. I later found a medical article that explained caffeine is an insulin inhibitor. Meaning that caffeine had a mild effect of reducing the effectiveness of my insulin and thus would slightly increase sugar levels.Discover your relationship with your disease. Listen to your doctor. Listen to tidbits like mine. Experiment a little. Find out what works for you.",
