            "answer": "\" Is this safe to take with the medications I am currently taking?\"Applies to: chromium picolinate, Levemir (insulin detemir)MONITOR: Pharmacologic dosages of chromium (200 mcg/day or more for adults) may potentiate the hypoglycemic effect of insulin and oral antidiabetic agents. Chromium appears to play a role in normal insulin function and glucose utilization, and some investigators have suggested that it increases insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance and decreases blood glucose levels in certain diabetics, possibly those with low chromium levels. However, others have not corroborated these findings, and a few have even reported a negative effect on glucose tolerance and blood levels. MANAGEMENT: Until further data are available, therapy with pharmacologic dosages of chromium should be administered cautiously in patients receiving insulin and/or oral antidiabetic agents due to the potential for additive risk of hypoglycemia. Patients should be monitored for changes in diabetic medication requirements.http://www.drugs.com/interactions-check.php",

            "answer": "The answer is yes. If you do so, you may require a little less insulin.The thing is some diabetics respond to chromium and some don't.\u00a0\u00a0The reasons for this are unclear. The Chromium sold in healthfood stores as Chromium (GTF) glucose tolerance factor is my recommendation.The same time each day eary in the morning is best, at least in the beginning. That way you will be up and about to moniter glucose levels.Waverider has the right info.",
