            "answer": "An ALT of 72 is very mildly elevated. It may be of no clinical signifiance. With a level that low, I don't think a person could live long enough (100+ years) for that level to do significant damage to the liver. I wouldn't lose much sleep over this level, but be sure to follow through with your doctor.",

    "question": "About a year ago my liver enzymes were accidentally discovered at being elevated.\u00a0\u00a0AST = 85 and ALT = 280.\u00a0\u00a0I drank (alcohol)about every weekend and really did not take much care of myself.\u00a0\u00a0Now I drink every so often and my enzyme levels especially AST have gone down.\u00a0\u00a0My ALT enzyme is staying around the 72 mark with the lab norm of 7-56 U/L.\u00a0\u00a0With my AST levels in the normal range, what could cause the ALT to still be slightly elevated.\u00a0\u00a0My mom had a transplant a year and a half ago with the cause being listed as cryptogenic chirrosis.\u00a0\u00a0She did abuse pain killers after a bad auto accident.\u00a0\u00a0I think that is what caused it.\u00a0\u00a0If I have a few drinks once a month is that going to potentially hurt me in the long run.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed by two different gastro's with one saying I have NASH with out even taking a biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0The other says fatty liver.\u00a0\u00a0Note: I have not had a biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0Can fatty liver lead to chirrosis?\u00a0\u00a0Is an occasional night out going to progress this?\u00a0\u00a0Any help would be very appreciated.",
