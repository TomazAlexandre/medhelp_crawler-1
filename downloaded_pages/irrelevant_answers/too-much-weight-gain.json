I can eat 4 cups of grapes to one candy bar. Good luck. And ignore that jerk of a doctor",

The doctors would ask what I'd be eating and I'd tell them I like my sweets but try to balance it out with lots of salads or lean proteins. But they'd always have something to say about the healthy stuff I was eating (my favorite was \"try eating some real vegetables\" in reference to mushrooms in my salad).It all varies, as long as you feel healthy and you're not like I was (giving in to all the sweets, every day),you'll be fine. GD can happen\u00a0\u00a0to anyone, it's about how your body processes the sugars not your weight.",

I don't know how much weight I've gained all together so far (I'm 39 weeks and 2 days) but a few months ago my old doctor told me that i shouldn't have gained any weight at all. I mean i wasn't skinny when i got pregnant, I'm a bigger woman but for him to say that to me pissed me off. Like obviously you gain weight when you're pregnant. At the time i had only gained like 20 pounds and he was making a big deal about it. I understand that he's a doctor and he's worried but you don't have to be a douche about it -_-",

I have been on a diet for almost 4 years prior to this pregnancy and feel like I don't know how to eat (i know sounds weird). Anyways, I'm enjoying my splurges every now and again but I do not feel at all like I'm eating out of control. Dr on call today pretty much made me feel like a glutton ;-(Has this happened to anyone else? And is this maybe a sign of gestational diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Took The test today",
