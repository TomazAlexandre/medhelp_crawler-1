            "answer": "Well, the \"normal\" people may think we're crazy, but you sound prefectly normal for a bipolar person to me. With bipolar we're not always manic or hypomanic or depressed. Days of clarity are real and it is normal to have them. Sometimes they last for weeks, months, and even years in some instances. But, the other stuff always comes back. I think that's why a lot of people think bipolar is a \"fake\" illness or it is just in your head. Well, it isn't fake or in your head. It's a biochemical disorder, which means it is physical. (Just like diabetes is biochemical.) The problem is we can't test for it like other illnesses because it is problems in your brain.",
