            "answer": "Hi,You need to get yourself investigated to rule out cervical spondylitis which could be causing the numbness. Also you need to rule out diabetes. Get your blood pressure checked. Wait for the reports to come in and when they do, consult a neurologist if the numbness still persists. Goodluck.",

Also ask him/her about what medication would be best for your migraines- ask him to prescribe you medication for acute attacks and also to prevent the attacks. Goodluck.",

    "question": "I had an abnormal migraine 9/25 and ended up going to the hospital since I was unable to take my Imatrex due to uncontrollable vomiting. I was also delerious and had a hard time communicating ideas. After that Saturday, I experienced frequent head pain and my neuorologist ordered an MRI and MRA but the radiologists have still not interpreted the slides. The headaches are now barely existant, but ever since last Wednesday 10/3, in my upper right arm I have been experiencing a pinching/burning sensation when I move it and that section in my arm is completely numb. I went to my PCP and they did blood work to check my electrolytes and everything came back fine. But I still am numb in my arm, I pinch myself and don't feel it, I can't feel hot or cold. I know this is not normal. Could that migraine have anything to do with it?",
