            "answer": "I had this problem. It was because my uterus was growing faster the second time around and there was not a problem with the baby. I would recommend getting another ultrasound because my doc had me get one to make sure everything was okay. I spent like an 1-1 1/2 hours with the sonographer who measured every little thing! But my baby was perfect, so yours probably is too! Probably just an experieinced uterus growing fast.",

    "question": "Hi there, I am now 31 weeks, but last week at my checkup the doc said I was measuring 34 weeks preg instead of 30 based on how many centimeters my uterous is from my pelvic bone.\u00a0\u00a0He wasn't concered and it was the first time seeing this doc because I just moved.\u00a0\u00a0He claims it is because I am short.\u00a0\u00a0Now, I have had 3 children and this is my 4th and this has never happened before.\u00a0\u00a0Last ultrasound 11 weeks ago showed everything was exact for due dates, so now why has my baby grown so large?\u00a0\u00a0Gestational diabetes test is negative and I have never had it before with other children either.\u00a0\u00a0I think the doc should do an ultrasound to check because I am concerned.\u00a0\u00a0My other 3 children were normal weights at 6lbs 14 oz, 8lbs 6.5 oz, and 7lbs 6.5 oz.\u00a0\u00a0My youngest is 5 yrs old, so it has been awhile since I was pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0So anyway, has this happened to any one else and should I demand an ultrasound to made sure there is not any fibroids or problems?Kristinna",
