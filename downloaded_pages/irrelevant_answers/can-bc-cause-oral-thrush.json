            "answer": "From what I've read and heard Oral thrush can be caused birth control pills. Many other things such as a dry mouth, medical conditions such as diabetes and HIV. There is such a list of things that can cause it. Some say home remedies such a yoghurt and Apple cider vinegar can help treat it.

You should be given anti-fungal medicine which should clear it up within a couple of days. Good luck.",
