            "answer": "Here's some things that you may already know:The word \"hepatitis\" means inflammation of the liver.(Hepatitis (Inflammation) can be caused by many different things---for example: alcohol.....drugs.....viruses (hepatitis viruses)..... hereditary diseases (hemochromatosis, wilsons disease, etc.)......uncontrolled diabetes.....etc., etc.)The word \"cirrhosis\" means scar tissue in the liver.\"Hepatitis\" (inflammation) can lead to \"Cirrhosis\" (scar tissue).Elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are a sign of inflammation.(Something actively bothering your liver).They don't reflect how much damage has already been done......They just reflect that something is actively (right now) bothering your liver. (inflammation).When a doctor sees elevated AST & ALT----the first thing they should do, is ask you alot of questions (to try to find the possible cause).(If you drink alcohol----that could easily be the cause.)(If you take Tylenol or NSAIDS or other drugs----that could be the cause.)The second thing the doctor should do, is tell you to stop doing those things........then come back for another liver enzyme test in a few weeks (to see if the inflammation has stopped).If stopping the alcohol (or drugs) makes all of your tests return to normal range-----great!If your enzymes stay elevated, even after you've stopped alcohol-----you should get screened for hepatitis viruses (Hep A, Hep B, Hep C, etc.)Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "First of all, drinking liquor can elevate your levels. Secondly, there is no way to tell if you have cirrhosis without a liver biopsy. You can be tested for Hepatitis without getting a biopsy and if you show HCV infection then I would recommend a biopsy.In short, I think you're getting a little bit ahead of yourself. I understand your concern but you need FACTS.Best,Scott",
