            "answer": "Hi Tennvic,How are you feeling now? Did your work involve doing repetitive movements of any joint, especially upper limbs?When where you diagnosed as having Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) and on what basis where you diagnosed?The diagnosis is based on the Selmonosky Triad during physical examination. This consists of Elevation of the hands, supraclavicular tenderness, weakening of the 4th and 5th fingers.Your MRI was reported as having disc bulging of Cervical 2nd to 5th vertebrae. This can also be the cause of your symptoms.Before diagnosing Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS), cervical vertebrae pathology needs to be ruled, which in your case is quite evident that it might be cervical vertebrae pathology causing the symptoms.I would recommend you to see another neurologist and an orthopaedician to re-evaluate and re-diagnose your case.What treatment modalities have the doctors planned after diagnosing you of having TOS?Keep me informed about your disease progression and about your discussion with doctors.Bye.",

            "answer": "Hey TennVic,Regardless if you have TOS, or something else. I recommend you see a Licensed Massage Practitioner. They work to manipulate underlying soft tissue (i.e., muscles, tendons, etc.) and help the body return back to a neutral position, reducing unnecessary stress on joints and nerves. My LMP has treated many clients with TOS successfully. There is hope and you can get your life back.",

            "answer": "Hi Tenvic,How are you feeling? What is your name?The 3 major causes of TOS are anatomic, trauma/repetitive activities, and neurovascular entrapment at the costo-clavicular space.AnatomicScalene triangle: Anterior scalene muscle frontally, middle scalene muscle posteriorly, and the upper border of the first rib inferiorly account for most cases of neurologic and arterial TOS.Cervical ribs and congenital fibro muscular bands are also causes for TOS.Trauma or repetitive activitiesMotor vehicle accident hyperextension injury is one of the causes.Neurovascular entrapment: This occurs in the costo-clavicular space between the first rib and the head of the clavicle.It is indeed sorry to say that as the time elapses more, more would be fibrosis and more would be symptoms.Keep me informed.Bye.",

            "answer": "Hi Mike,Have you seen any doctor for your symptoms? What are the imagings studies being done?I want you to take treatment as early as possible as there are other conditions which can rise due to thoracic outlet.It is believed that a nerve that has some degrees of compression in the neck is more sensitive to nerve compression problems at other points along its course, such as at the elbow or the wrist.Thus, patients with TOS are more susceptible to developing Cubital Tunnel Syndrome, and vice versa.This phenomenon has been termed the double crush syndrome.Do you have arthritis, diabetes, and alcoholism or thyroid disease?Patients with arthritis, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, and alcoholism have nerves with increased susceptibility to the development of superimposed nerve compression.The cornerstone of nonoperative therapy is a carefully regulated program of muscle strengthening and postural re-education exercises.Exercises must be continued until muscular atrophy and weakness is reversed and correct posture is developed.If a carefully supervised exercise and postural program fails, and the patient has intractable pain, surgery may be indicated.Hope this helps you.Keep me informed about your decision and any consultations hereafter.Bye.",

            "answer": "Hi Mike,I did get your point as to what is stopping you from getting treatment.As the days progresses the condition would be worse and ultimately you would land up in surgery.You mean to say that the doctors are not convinced about Thoracic Outlet syndrome (TOS).Part of therapy of TOS is to make the patient understand about the condition.Explanation of the pathologic process of TOS helps to alleviate a patient's concerns and makes the patient more receptive when instructed to avoid certain activities and postures.Specific contributory factors, such as repetitive elevated positioning of the arms at work, should be identified and, when possible, addressed.Has anybody told you about surgery or what surgery could be planned?Keep me informed and take care.Bye.",
