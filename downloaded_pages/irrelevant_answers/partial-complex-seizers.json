            "answer": "yes they think they can but it is the unsafest thing to do!!!!! They think they are aware of their surroundings and can work through it and still operate at times through them not always but things are distorted and it takes you over. I use to still listen to someone talking but I had no idea what I was looking like and it was distorted and I thought at times I could function but in reality you aren't functioning normal. Does this make sense? Driving off is taking someone and their life at risk, high risk. Afterwards you have a bad headache and feel weak and for me I have a hard time talking, how are they? Do they get an aura and a chemical smell?",

            "answer": "HiHope all is wellThanks for the response, I know for sure driving off is very dangerous! At the same time it is so sad that the person with epilepsy can get into the car while having a seizure. It is terrible for the person with the sickness and for a victim if any..This person I know just had partial complex seizures. no warning signs at all...EVER. No aura's either. They have had surgery and have not had one seizure since. It's so strange, from a person having seizures every day or ervery other day to none, God Bless the surgery. I want to start something up for people with epilepsy and diabetes, so the public can be fully awre of certain situations, it's just not fair on whats going on out in this world when they see someone with an illness, not knowing they have an illness, so they think the person is drunk, high or just plain crazy, this relly needs to end. I want to help so bad.",

Helping others understand and the ones going through the illnesses that we suffer daily. God bless you!!! I hope the surgery helps my seizures. Maybe it will help my memory and other brain ailments with it.",
