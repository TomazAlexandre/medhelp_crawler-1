            "answer": "Rachel, if he indeed has diabetes insipidus he has to be involved with a pediatric endocrinologist, this doc can also assess a few more things in regards to growth, what are the other pituitary hormones doing, they can get labs and it is not necessary to restrict fluids for as long as 12 hours, sometimes we get our labs back after only 3-5 hours, so the peds endo can do this and they are very experienced at a water deprivation test.",

            "answer": "Well when I brought up the fact that my son drinks a ton the doc didn't really think much of it until I told her he drinks probably a good 15 to 20 oz (3 or 4 sippy's) of water within 2 hours after waking up then she ordered the urine catch test.\u00a0\u00a0It was our regular ped doc that we seen so no specialist as of yet but I'm thinking we might want to look into it further after reading more about DI and finding a reason why it started.\u00a0\u00a0What I was wondering is could there be 1 condition causing all these symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0I didn't get much info from the doc just info over the phone and info that I got off the internet.\u00a0\u00a0The doc didn't seem too concerned.",

            "answer": "Diabetes insipidus is a serious diagnosis, only a subspecialist should be making this diagnosis final and deciding about treatment, a urine test is not the tell all, it is helpful but if a child just drank 20 oz a urine will be dilute! That is normal. You must see an endocrinologist if the pediatrician indeed says this is diabetes insipidus.",

    "question": "I don't exactly know where this belongs into \"topics\" but I'm hoping you can help.\u00a0\u00a0My son was born almost 2 years ago on 11/6/06 at 28 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0My first son was born at 28 weeks also but caught up on size rather quickly.\u00a0\u00a0Well my almost 2 year old weighs about 22lbs and measures about 30 1/2 inches long.\u00a0\u00a0He hasn't grown much since his last visit at his 18 month appt and everyone comments on his size and how small he is.\u00a0\u00a0Anyways I'm getting a little concerned about his size and not growing very much.\u00a0\u00a0He was tested back in the spring for Diabetes Insipidus for drinking so much water and it came back positive.\u00a0\u00a0My child eats and eat and eats but gains nothing...\u00a0\u00a0Could both of these issues, Diabetes Insipidus and lack of growth, be something more and maybe I should bring something up at his 2 yr appt in a month?\u00a0\u00a0The doc does want to retest for the DS but it was hard enough not giving him anything to drink for 12 hours espcially at bedtime when he brings 2 sippy's to bed with him when he was first tested in the spring.\u00a0\u00a0Another concern is he has extreme constipation I don't know if this goes hand in hand with anything but we've had him on adult doses of Mirloax and presciption drugs but nothing really seemed to work without giving him stomach cramps, could this be tagged into the other issues also?\u00a0\u00a0I don't mind him being small but I think he should start growing a little more than what he's do now.\u00a0\u00a0He on track with everything else, and it's kinda funny to look at him and see basically a 1 year old and then watch him play and talk like a 2 year old.Let me know what you think:-)Thanks Rachel",
