            "answer": "Welcome to the forum.I really see no cause for alarm.\u00a0\u00a0The story of someone 20 years old with diabetes and having syringes around is entirely plausible; childhood-onset diabetes is common and usually requires insulin by injection.\u00a0\u00a0Second, I'm guessin your partner's mom would not cover for her daughter if she thought she was an injection drug user.\u00a0\u00a0Have you directly asked your girlfriend if she uses injection drugs?\u00a0\u00a0If not, you should; she probably would reply truthfully.\u00a0\u00a0On top of all that, of course injection drug use itself is not a risk factor for HIV, only if the user shares injection equipment with others.As for your symptoms, HIV doesn't cause runny nose or sneezing.\u00a0\u00a0You have a cold or allergy, not HIV.In any case, you are wise to plan on testing.\u00a0\u00a0Not so much because of the things you have said here, but because t's always wise for new sex partners to both be tested for HIV and other STDs.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to HIV, you should both be tested for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis.\u00a0\u00a0Ideally you would have continued to use condoms until you had been tested -- but the chance either of you has HIV is very low and you can expect negative test results.I hope this has helped.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes for a romantic, mutually rewarding relationship.HHH, MD",
