            "answer": "I am a Diabetic type 2 and have been since '96. The normal range for your blood sugar is 70 to 120. I take my blood sugars before breakfast, before lunch, before dinner, and before bedtime. I am on 2 different insulins and on Glucophage 1000mg 2 times a day. I am supposed to take my insulin shots 3 to 4 times a day depending on my blood sugar. Please, monitor your blood sugar and take care of yourself so your prediabetes does not get any worse. When yor blood sugar was 150 had you had anything to eat because anything you eat can effect your sugar.",

Up to 120 prenandial would be incorrect and not a normal range.",

            "answer": "i am a qualified nurse and look after a lot of patients with diabetes also my mother and grandmother where type2 your blood sugar should range from 7 to 12 as a normal level you should always take your blood sugar before administrating your insulin as slight infections or common colds and things can change ur insulin levels and you could end up giving yourself to much insulin. 2nd diet just try to cut down on sugary items if you have a main meal of say chicken and veg then you can have a small pudding try not to cut sugar out of your diet all together as we still need to have sugar in our bodys but try to stick to sugar free items and low in fat, excercise also can help in diabetes if you are overweight then increasing excercise can bring down the amount of insulin that you take but you should speak to your doctor reguarding that there is plenty of supporrt groups around to help and websites. hope all is well take care nic. x",

Be sure to notate what you ate and eliminate those foods doing harm.\u00a0\u00a0For example; I can eat melons, pears, and berries but not tropical fruits such as pineapple, guava, or mangoes. The latter will spike my glucose above the 200 range. Once you understand what foods you can and cannot consume you can reduce the postnandial testing. Basically, stay away from sugar and bad carbs and do moderate exercise like walking on a routine basis.",
