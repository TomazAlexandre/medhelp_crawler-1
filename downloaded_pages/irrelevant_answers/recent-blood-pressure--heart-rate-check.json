            "answer": "Did you know that there are many lawsuits against the manufacturers of Seroquel, and other drugs of this class, atypical antipsychotic medications?FDA Alert on seroquel from WebMD Medical News:Check with your physician if you have any of the following:Conditions:Abnormal Movements of Face Muscles and Tongue, Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, Tobacco Smoking, Epileptic Seizure, Cataracts, Metabolic Syndrome X, Dementia in an Elderly Person, Heart Attack, Disease of Inadequate Blood Flow to the Heart Muscle, Abnormal Heart Rhythm, Chronic Heart Failure, Any Disorder of the Blood Vessels of the Brain, Blood Pressure Drop Upon Standing, Abnormally Low Blood Pressure, Liver Problems, High Blood Sugar, Decreased Blood Volume, Underactive Thyroid, Diabetes, High Amount of Fats in the Blood, Extreme Loss of Body Water, Overweight, Having Thoughts of Suicide-------------------------------------------------------------------------Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including SEROQUEL. Rare cases of NMS have been reported with SEROQUEL. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cardiovascular SystemFrequent: palpitation; Infrequent: vasodilatation, QT interval prolonged, migraine, bradycardia, cerebral ischemia, irregular pulse, T wave abnormality, bundle branch block, cerebrovascular accident, deep thrombophlebitis, T wave inversion; Rare: angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation, AV block first degree, congestive heart failure, ST elevated, thrombophlebitis, T wave flattening, ST abnormality, increased QRS durationCholesterol and Triglyceride ElevationsIn schizophrenia trials, the proportions of patients with elevations to levels of cholesterol \u2265240 mg/dL and triglycerides \u2265200 mg/dL were 16% and 23% for SEROQUEL treated patients respectively compared to 7% and 16% for placebo patients respectively. In bipolar depression trials, the proportion of patients with cholesterol and triglycerides elevations to these levels were 9% and 14% for SEROQUEL treated patients respectively, compared to 6% and 9% for placebo patients respectively.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------January 30, 2004Dear Health Care Provider,AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP would like to inform you of important labeling changes regarding SEROQUEL \u00ae (quetiapine fumarate). The FDA has asked all manufacturers of atypical antipsychotic medications, including AstraZeneca, to add a Warnings statement describing the increased risk of hyperglycemia and diabetes in patients taking these medications, including SEROQUEL.Accordingly, the SEROQUEL Prescribing Information has been updated with the addition of the following information:WARNINGSHyperglycemia and Diabetes MellitusHyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including Seroquel. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (eg, obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.AstraZeneca remains committed to providing you with the most current product information available for the management of your patients. You may immediately review the Warnings statement about hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus in the SEROQUEL Prescribing Information by visiting the web site www.Seroquel.com. Updated package inserts containing the additional hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus information will accompany the medication in the near future and you should, of course, refer to the insert for full Prescribing Information.As always, we request that serious adverse events be reported to AstraZeneca at 1-800-236-9933 or to the FDA MedWatch program at 1-800-FDA-1088, by fax at 1-800-FDA-0178, or by email at www.fda.gov/medwatch. For additional medical information about SEROQUEL, please call 1-800-236-9933 from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm EST, Monday through Friday.Sincerely,Wayne Macfadden, MDSenior Director/Clinical ResearchAstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals",

Sorry, but I have read a lot about this drug and subsequent lawsuits.....Don't want to make anyone with a screen name \" Southern Charm\" mad :) ThoughTry googling it. Many doctors have quit prescribing it. Little is known about how this class of drugs work, BUT much is known about the very serious side effects they cause. It won't be on the market too much longer.....",
