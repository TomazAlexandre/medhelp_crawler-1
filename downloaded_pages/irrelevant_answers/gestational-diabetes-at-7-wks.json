I'm 35 weeks now and my Dr said my sugar levels look fantastic. it's under control with diet changes.

            "answer": "I just went to class about this on Tuesday. Watch your sugar and carbohydrates! It's so early in your pregnancy that the development is still occurring so if it's not controlled,yes birth defects. I know it's scary but watch what you eat and exercise! We were taught 15-30 grams of carbs for breakfast and 45-60 for each lunch and dinner",

            "answer": "They caught mine at 14 weeks (and baby was developing fine prior and since then). You'll have to watch your carbs (it's about total carbs and not just sugar), certain things you should not eat or drink (they'll give you a list), and you'll have to test your blood daily (I have to prick my finger four times a day). If you can't get your levels down by just a diet change your doctor will determine if you need pills or insulin shots to help. Most importantly, I want you to know it is nothing you did wrong. This happens to many women regardless of weight, race, or age. Our bodies is trying to produce enough insulin for two and for some of us our pancreas just need a little more help. For many women it goes away once the baby is born because you're back to only needing enough insulin for one person. This is all done also to prevent your baby from being too big at birth, too low blood sugar at birth, and decrease chances of your baby developing diabetes later in life as well as decrease chances of your baby growing up obese. So follow the diet the best you can, don't be upset if you might later need medicine or insulin to help with your levels, and don't be hard on yourself because you didn't do anything wrong. I'm now 21 weeks and it has been fine and baby is doing very well. Best of wishes.",

            "answer": "When I found out, I was devastated because I haven't ate sweets and all those sugary snacks with this pregnancy and I had abnormal levels. My 1st two pregnancies, I lived on intense chocolate milk, nutty bars and twix and had perfect sugar levels so No worries, it's nothing u did wrong. Just like everyone above mentioned, watch your carbs. It's pretty simple. Try not to ear a lot of breads and starches, have lots of proteins and green veggies. You'll be ok :)",
