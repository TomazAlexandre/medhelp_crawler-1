    "question": "I noticed that after I exercise, whether light or heavy, I develop a strong body odor that has an earthy-musty smell or sometimes a \"nail polish\" smell. The smell usually occurs several hours later or the following day. And it usually lasts from 20 minutes to several hours. Yes, I shower, have good hygiene, and don't have anything in my nose! And tests for diabetes and liver disease has come up negative. These symptoms have been going on for approximately 8 months. I usually work out 5-6 days a week. When I stop working out, I do not have these body odors.\u00a0\u00a0I've been recently diagnosed with Hypothyroidism. Any ideas as to what I may be experiencing? I am scheduled for an MRI. Bottom line: there is a direct correlation between me working out and these odd body odors.",
