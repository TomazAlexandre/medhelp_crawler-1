I've suffered enough, been to the doctor so many times, but I'm going to get through the bottom of this.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Fatigue, hair loss, pale face and sleepiness could be due to low iron or anemia. Delayed healing of cut and bruise, muscle weakness is seen in diabetes. There is also a chance that you have acidity and gastric reflux. Reflux can make the voice hoarse. I am not sure what you mean by motion sickness\u2014generally this is something people feel when they are travelling from one altitude to another. This happens due to changing pressure in the canals of internal ear. However, if you are feeling nausea and vomiting on changing your position, it can be due to postural hypotension (fall in BP while standing or sitting up from lying down position), compression of cervical spinal nerves, or due to internal ear problems.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. You could be having more than one problem. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
