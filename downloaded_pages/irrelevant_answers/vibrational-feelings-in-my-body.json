            "answer": "Hi,I am afraid I do not have a definite idea what this could be. In relation to his diabetes, he should contact his doctor to be sure this is not a pre-emptive warning regarding heart disease(which may not show up as chest pain in a diabetic). It is unlikely to be neuropathy given his diabetes being mild as you say. If his BP is not well controlled it may contribute. It sounds more likely\u00a0\u00a0to be a nerve problem, but he will need to be examined and have radiology studies for this to be determiend. Contact his doctor soon to have this arranged.take care.",

            "answer": "I know exactly what you are describing. I'm 53 and was diagnosed about a year and a half ago with type 2 pre-diabetes,\u00a0\u00a0I tried to explain those same exact symptoms to my doctor and he looked at me like I was nuts.\u00a0\u00a0Mine are very short, less than 30 seconds at a time, sometimes several times a day, and remind me of grabbing onto an electric fence. Mostly upper body.\u00a0\u00a0Not painful, just not \"normal\".\u00a0\u00a0I have been taking Glucophage once a day for my diabetes ever since I was diagnosed but those symptoms had started before I started taking any medication for my diabetes.In March of 2006 Drs. found heart blockage and I had to have a stent put in.\u00a0\u00a0I was put on 11 different medications, 2 of which were Plavix and Vytorin.\u00a0\u00a0It wasn't until about 2 months ago that I was given blood pressure medication. So if it has anything to do with medication, I would have to think that it must be the cholesterol medicine.\u00a0\u00a0I'm going to be going back to the doctor (a different one) in the next two weeks and I planned on discussing this with him.\u00a0\u00a0I will post what he tells me.",
