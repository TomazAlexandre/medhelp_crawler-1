            "answer": "I saw one Monday because I have been a diabetic since childhood. It's just a high risk OBGYN. The appointment was just like my other ones they did a long ultrasound which I was very excited, they had much better equipment than my reg obgyn, I got to see a much clearer view of my baby and got to see how much she moves I'm only 13 weeks and the tech was able to tell me it was a girl. The specialist just went over my medical history of diabetes how to take care of myself now that I am expecting. I was nervous to go but they were extremely caring and actually made me feel a lot more comfortable with being diabetic and pregnant. I'm so happy I went.",
