Ironic isn't it thay hep c saved me from finding my cancer too late? I'm a 2B genotype and I hope to clear this evil virus permanently..Last time, I cleared the virus(regular interferon 3 times weekly plus ribo) and then relapsed shortly after finishing the tx... I'm looking forward to having an excuse for my \"ribo rage\"....Also I gotta a big B-day tommorow (busy week) wish me luck....alan",
