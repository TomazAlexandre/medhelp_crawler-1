    "question": "I notice that every so often my 15 month old has a sweet smell to her skin. Itseems most obvious after a bit of excitement and activity, particularly after she's been sweating. Someone from another site that I posted her symptoms had mentioned diabetes.Because of medical problems she's been having since she was 6 months old, she'd been through all sorts of tests. Now, being that my 4 year old was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes last year, naturally, that was one of the many tests she's had done. Her results came back fine. I've even checked her sugar. It was perfect. I also haven't noticed any of the other tell tale signs that my other daughter presented. SO, am I missing something? Any info would be appreciated.",
