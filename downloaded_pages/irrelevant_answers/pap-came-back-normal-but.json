            "answer": "Yeah, i have been looking online because i thought it could be a yeast infection. It doesn't have a strong odor and there is no itching, plus wouldn't the test have caught that? But, I read something about how diabetes could possibly be a cause of discharge. I know it runs in my family, but i always thought that diabetes was usually from being over-weight...i only weigh 115lbs. Any thoughts??",

            "answer": "Okay, the comment you made about how you thought only over weight people get diabetes is inaccurate.\u00a0\u00a0There are two types of diabetes Type 1 and Type 2.\u00a0\u00a0Type 1 is called juvenile diabetes which hits children and young adults under 20 years of age, and your are on insulin shots for the rest of your life, HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WEIGHT.\u00a0\u00a0Type 2 is normally found in overweight children and adults, are on pills for the rest of your life.My mother was 19 when she got type 1 diabetes and she only weight 100lbs. She is now almost 60 years old.As for your discharge, are you finding it everyday or a few days a month between menstral cycles.\u00a0\u00a0Because if it is only for a few days a month you may be ovulating.",

            "answer": "Just wanted to let you know - some people get more discharge than others. I never did\u00a0\u00a0until fairly recently. For me, it may have to do with changes in hormones or my pill. But when I have a yeast infection there is a definite change in the type of discharge.I'm sure your doctor would have tested for yeast while you were there. You may just have a lot -- hopefully it will get less as you get older.Also -- Mom2grls0204 -- My mom has Diabetes Type 1, and did not get it until after my sister was born at the age of 30. She had gestational with me, it went away, then after my sis it was back as Type 1 -- so you can get it at any age.",

            "answer": "If you mother has type one diabetes then she probably had it for 10 years or so and didn't know it.\u00a0\u00a0Because as a healthcare provider I can tell you if you develope diabetes after the age of 20 you have type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Your mom probably had diabetes since she was a kid or teenager but never had problems until later in life.",

    "question": "Alright, I am 19 years old, and still a virgin but recently i have been experiencing more discharge than normal, along with some slight pains so i went in for my first pap test. During the test the doctor said everything looked healthy but that there was quiet a bit of discharge and that when the tests came back we could figure out what it was and get it taken care of. Well, today i recieved the results and they were normal and nothing is wrong with me. I am just wondering how this is possible, if she thought something was wrong...and the tests show that im fine? I'm just a little confused, maybe because this was my first test and i'm new at this kinda stuff. Any suggestions on what the discharge could be from?? Thanks in advance for your time and input!",
