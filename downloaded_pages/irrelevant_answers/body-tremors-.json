            "answer": "Hello.This symptom is a bit unusual. Tremors are generally visible on hands and fingers. The shoulder is too bulky to have tremors. Do you mean fasciculation? How does the shoulder move? Does she have tremors of the hands?Can you get her neck MRI, just to rule out any cervical cord problem? Then only one can think of any functional issues (stress or anxiety).Regards",

            "answer": "Finally I have found someone with a similar problem!\u00a0\u00a0My first symptoms were a tightness/burning sensation in my shoulders and my forearms, after 3 days this turned into a fine tremor in my shoulders (barely visible) and this has continued for the past 2 weeks, 24/7 with no periods of remission.\u00a0\u00a0My doctors has done numerous blood tests to rule out thyroid,diabetes,lupus, calcium deficiency. I saw my neuro and his in person tests turned out fine, then had me get a brain and cervical MRI, which turned out clean.\u00a0\u00a0I have an EMG scheduled in 2 days. My doctors seem to think it is due to stress or anxiety, but I don't think stress or anxiety would cause 24/7 tremors for 2 weeks straight.\u00a0\u00a0Muscle relaxants have little effect on the tremors besides making me drowsy.This is driving me crazy and depressed, I have been scouring these forums for someone with symptoms like mine but everyone seems to have either intentional tremors and most of the tremors are located in people's hands and head.I am a 23 year old physically active male.\u00a0\u00a0An update on your daughters progress would be great Rebecca. I hope everything gets better.-Chris",

    "question": "My daughter has been hospitalized with tremors, particularly located in her shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0Her catscan was fine, blood tests are fine, and they are trying to rule it as stress.\u00a0\u00a0However, during the past year several times when she has been tapped on the head she has nearly passed out--She has had lots of trouble with shoulder pain.\u00a0\u00a0She is not stressed out--what else is there we could/should be looking for?She is coherent--but the tremors have been going on for over 24 hours even with muscle relaxers.Thanks",
