    "question": "Dr. Goodman,I am a 47-yr-old 5 days post op from a supracervical hysterectomy BSO.\u00a0\u00a0In late February, I had a gyn visit with a new OB/gyn after spending most of my time recently focusing on a 2005 diagnosis of type II diabetes and trying to manage my condition with insulin, diet and exercise as best I could.\u00a0\u00a0After reading a lot on my symptoms and struggling with pregnancies (1 miscarriage and 2 borderline gestational diabetic), I basically diagnosed myself with polycystic ovarian syndrome but had not really taken care of or paid attention to this condition after my diabetes diagnosis because it was out of control for quite a while.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, upon examining me on 2/19/08, my new gyn immediately ordered an ultrasound then a CT scan and sent me for a second opinion and surgical consultation with a gyn/oncologist telling me I had a very large rt ovarian cyst (20 cm).\u00a0\u00a0I later had a uterine biopsy which came back negative for cancer.\u00a0\u00a0This allowed my gyn to make the decision to leave my cervix intact and only take ovaries, fallopian tubes and uterus.\u00a0\u00a0My rt ovary had a cystadenoma described as the size of an 8 lb baby or a small watermelon and my lt ovary also had a much smaller cyst (about tangerine sized).\u00a0\u00a0Can you help me better understand the benfits of leaving my cervix and also what correlation does ovarian cysts have with diabetes or where I might learn more about this connection?",
