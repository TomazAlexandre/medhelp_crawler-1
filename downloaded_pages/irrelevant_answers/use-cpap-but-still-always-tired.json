    "question": "I have always had trouble waking in the morning no matter how much sleep I get. Have been on CPAP for OSA for 2 years. Even though dr. checked CPAP card and all looks good, I still can't wake up. I struggle with energy, concentration, memory, etc. during the day. Especially over the last year or two I struggle with motivation to do things that I need to do.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on Effexor for general moodiness, etc. for about 3 years and Allegra for allergies for 2 years.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. recently increased Effexor from 75mg to 150mg thinking that depression is causing energy symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0No change that I can tell.\u00a0\u00a0Have gained about 30 lbs. in the past 3-4 years, even though my diet has not changed.\u00a0\u00a0Use to be able to buckle down and lose weight thru diet and excercise, but can no longer find the motivation. The difficulty of waking up is bad enough, but the total lack of motivation is becoming unbearable. It is causing me problems with getting tasks done both at work and at home. Any ideas?!?!?!?",
