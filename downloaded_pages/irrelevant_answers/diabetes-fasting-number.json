    "question": "Does anyone have any advice on how to keep or get my morning fasting numbers down? I've been drinking the Organic \"mother\" Apple Cider vinegar and having a piece of cheese before bedtime and drink Ceylon cinnamon with my coffee every day. I think its helping a little cause on the mornings im high its usually when i forget to drink the vinegar.\u00a0\u00a0Any advice would be greatly appreciated!\u00a0\u00a0NanPS : i no longer eat pasta or regular bread - i noticed the Weight Watchers 100% whole wheat bread does not affect my numbers so i treat myself to a turkey sandwich about 3 times a week. Of course i stopped eating junk food and trying to drink alot of water ~ which is a bit of a chore for me.\u00a0\u00a0I recently started using my treadmill and swimming in my pool. That pretty much sums it up. :o)",
