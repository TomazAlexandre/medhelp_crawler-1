            "answer": "Vicodin is an opiate that is highly addictive & if taken for a long period of time both you & the baby could form a dependency on them... I would assume tho that your dr would know best as to whether they're safe or not? I wouldn't take them but then again I won't take tylenol while pregnant.. but obviously your dr thinks they're safe so that's completly up to you",

I am 24 weeks and 1 day. I don't want to take them if it will hurt him. Btw i am also a high risk pregnancy and have gestational diabetes with this one. Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.",
