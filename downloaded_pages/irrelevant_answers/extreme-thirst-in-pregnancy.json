So I drink lots of propel. Strawberry Kiwi is really good. Keep us posted!amber",

            "answer": "1. First, count how much water you are drinking. It should be at least (for nonpregnant person) like 80 ounces a day (depnds how big you are). At least 1 1/2 times that for pregnant, even at beginning. That's a lot of water. Coffee/juice etc doesn't count. Propel doesn't either. Anything that has elements in it that have to be digested/filtered is liquid that is not solely going to hydrate you (and in some cases will dehydrate you). Caffeine is extremely dehydrating; soda pop is really bad for you too. If you fill a jar and drink only out of that you can subtract and see how much you are drinking. I am and have been really thirsty (15 weeks). YOu have to make a lot of new blood and have to filter lots more activity too. If you're way up over 120 ounces, then I'd worry.2. I thought GD developed later in pregnancy, not first trimester.Now in my 2nd tri, my thirst has calmed down a little bit but still I can't keep up, chapped lips, always kind of thirsty etc.3. Ask doctor. Don't they test your urine at every visit for sugar spilling?Good luck, now I'm thirsty writing about all this water!",
