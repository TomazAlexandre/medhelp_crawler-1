            "answer": "My TSH was .009 after my first blood test. I think .40 to 4.5 is \"normal.\" This number seems to go down as the T3 and T4 go up. Maybe I should just shut up because I'm new to all of this myself, but I've learned more from the folks on here than I have from the endocrinologists.If you have Graves' disease it only gets worse. I remember thinking 2 1/2 years ago that it was just a little nuisance that I'd get over in a couple months, but, even while being treated for it, it only got worse and worse. Watch out for the heart. I ended up in the hospital with mine--and it was a result of doing what the doctor said.",

            "answer": "Hyperthyroid symptoms can be really strange and sometimes the docs don't understand when you tell them something just isn't \"right\".\u00a0\u00a0For three months I was having a weird rush of hormones at almost the same time every afternoon, and felt horried and weak for about an hour and periodically my skin would feel prickly, including my face, a sure sign of hyperthyroidism, and just plain exhausted a lot, but I had even more strange symptoms of just not being able to think clearly, just trying to concentrate on anything literally made me nausiated. Then the docs said my symptoms sounded like a brain tumor and did an MRI. All was well. I have a great endo, but all this time she was positive it was not my levels.\u00a0\u00a0I finally got my dose lowered, though, and it was amazing!\u00a0\u00a0I felt normal again! Many doctors treat by the numbers/levels, but also how a patient feels symptom wise should be considered.\u00a0\u00a0So, all that said, yes, your symptoms, from my experience, may very well be related from being hyperthyroid. The being thirsty alot makes pricks my ears for symptoms of diabetes, as it is also endocrine related, and blood sugar levels can really mess with you, too, so you may want to ask about that, too.",
