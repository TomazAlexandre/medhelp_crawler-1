            "answer": "HI,Dizziness associated with headaches, nausea and fainting attacks can indicate a problem with the brain, inner ear or the spine. This will need further evaluation in the form of ENT examination. Also an X-ray cervical spine may be done, to rule out cervical spondilitis. Consult your Doctor.Take care & good luck.",

            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Fainting or syncope may be attributed to a decreased blood flow to the brain. This can occur because\u00a0\u00a0the heart fails to pump the blood;\u00a0\u00a0the blood vessels don't have enough tone to maintain blood pressure to deliver the blood to the brain; there is not enough blood or fluid within the blood vessels; or a combination of these. Other considerations include eye and ear issues, anemia and other medical conditions such as seizure, diabetes or anemia.\u00a0\u00a0If it persists, it is best that you have this evaluated further by your doctor for proper management.\u00a0\u00a0Take care and do keep us posted.",
