            "answer": "Hi Dee12!\u00a0\u00a0Whenever a new medication is taken, it can affect your blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin is a hormone and different hormones have different strengths.\u00a0\u00a0This factor may make the insulin less effective.\u00a0\u00a0My best guess is that this is the reason why you are requiring higher amounts of insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, there is a correlation between insulin and fat storage, but this does not necessarily mean that you will gain weight.\u00a0\u00a0It can, however, if you are consuming more calories than what you are burning off during the day.\u00a0\u00a0Thank goodness for your pump, you know?\u00a0\u00a0Being on shots would make this situation must harder to get back under control.\u00a0\u00a0What's important is that you keep trying to achieve optimum bg readings throughout the day by exercising and following a healthy diet containing fresh fruits & vegetables, whole grains and low fat dairy products.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this has shed some light on this for you.",

    "question": "I am 22 and a type 1 for 1 year on a minimed pump.\u00a0\u00a0I was having issues with irregular menstrual cycles, so my doctor put me on a low dosage birth control pill, but since going on the pill 3 days ago, my blood sugars have been elevated despite doubling my insulin doses.\u00a0\u00a0I finally figured out new ratios to keep my blood sugars under control, but am taking more than twice as much insulin.(.3 basal and carb ratio 1:4 and sensitivity of 15 points for 1 unit)\u00a0\u00a0I have heard that increased insulin intake is correlated with weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0Will taking so much insulin cause me to gain weight even though I am eating the same number of calories?\u00a0\u00a0I know that insulin takes sugar into your body so that it can use it for energy or store it, so i am curious what is happening to all this extra insulin i am taking.",
