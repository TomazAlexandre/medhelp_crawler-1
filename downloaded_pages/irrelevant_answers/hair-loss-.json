            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, increased bilirubin can cause hair loss. This happens mainly in hereditary hemochromatosis which is a genetic condition in which excess iron is absorbed from the gut and stored in various parts of the body.On the other hand low iron too can cause hair loss. Iron deficiency can be due to poor intake or poor absorption or due to hidden loss from bleeding as is seen in UTI and gut problems like IBS. The cause of anemia has to be found out by various blood tests. Iron replacement along with diet rich in iron and hemoglobin should be given. Please consult a hematologist if iron deficiency is detected. Hair loss can also be due to dandruff, dermatitis, shampoos, oils, soaps, dust and dirt etc. Thyroid disorders and diabetes too could be a cause. Insomnia, stress and anxiety along with poor diet and excess of caffeine too can be the cause. Hope this helps. Take care!",
