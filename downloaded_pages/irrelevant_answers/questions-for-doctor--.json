Welcome!\u00a0\u00a0All of us have anxiety sweetheart, so don't beat yourself up.\u00a0\u00a0Having all these symptoms going on in our bodies, makes us more anxious.\u00a0\u00a0I am convinced of it.\u00a0\u00a0I have been diagnosed with Relapsing/Remitting MS for over a decade.While I do believe like you that if you have one auto-immune disease you probably are more prone to others - basically, it's NOT true.\u00a0\u00a0See, I am the person that is convinced that arthritis is auto-immune and diabetes is auto-immune.\u00a0\u00a0I have been told by many that having diabetes is NOT an auto-immune disorder.\u00a0\u00a0But I am steadfast in my beliefs.\u00a0\u00a0I think it is.Anyway you do have symptoms that should be followed up by a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Is it MS?\u00a0\u00a0No one on the Forum could tell you for certain.\u00a0\u00a0We are just laypeople that are fighting for a diagnosis of something or already have a diagnosis of MS.\u00a0\u00a0We are all in this fight together and we are quite a group of loving and compassionate people.While you search for answers, we will be here for you night and day.\u00a0\u00a0Your symptoms do suggest something going on in the nerves, but to be able to sort that all out and find out exactly what it is, takes a good doctor and probably a qualified Neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0The testing can be exhausting and a diagnosis of MS can take quite a long time.\u00a0\u00a0For some, the diagnosis is simple and there are a few that have been diagnosed after their first exam and MRI of the brain and spine.Please look over our Health Page section in the upper right hand corner of this page.\u00a0\u00a0This is so much invalable information there, that will answer alot of your questions.\u00a0\u00a0Much more than I could ever remember to tell you in one post.\u00a0\u00a0So please look that over and come back to us with any questions that you may have.One thing to remember dearheart....You are NOT in all of this alone.\u00a0\u00a0You are now among friends.\u00a0\u00a0Through thick and thin.\u00a0\u00a0I promise you...Big Forum Hugs from All,HeatherThey call me \"Earth Mother\"",

The neuro. tests she ran on me (eye. . .stregnth etc.) all were good & after blood work, I go back in a week for a follow-up and we'll see where we go from there.Thank you all again I really appreciate the support.Be well!",

    "question": "What questions do I ask, & how do I ask them so I am taken seriously and not brushed off as a nut suffering from health anxiety?Thanks in advance!!Here is my story. . .My journey from relatively healthy to a Total Thyroidectomy for Graves Disease to where I am today has been rocky to say the least.\u00a0\u00a0I have always been an anxious person.\u00a0\u00a0The type of person who makes moluntains out of molehills and often expects the worst.\u00a0\u00a0People have told me that I am a hypochondirac and that I have anxiety. . .that may very well be true, but what if it is more than that??I had my TT surgery in August.\u00a0\u00a0Since then, I have not been myself and have begun to experience a host of what I can only describe as neurological symptoms.Immediately after the surgery, my calcium crashed, and I was put back into the hospital for a week while my calcium was regulated.\u00a0\u00a0After that, I have suffered from numerous twitches & tingles. . .my endo chalked them up to stress and normal twitches that everyone experiences.Then I thought I was having chest pains. . .I saw a cardiologist. . .had a bunch of tests. . .everything came back normal & now I don't have chest related problems anymore.Twitches & tingles continued. . .now the left side of my face feels numbish, I have temple pressure (no pain) and my cheek and lip feel odd. . .so does my tounge/mouth weird taste & sensation.I also have back pain and the aforementioned random twitches. . .and I cry at the drop of a hat.I am convinced that I have MS or some other type of neurological disease.\u00a0\u00a0There are just too many symptoms and they aren't going away.\u00a0\u00a0I'm seeing my GP today, but I am terrified that they are just going to chalk it up to health anxiety because of my past (about 10 years ago, I had anxiety attacks w/ dizziness, similar lip numbness and chest pains).What if it wasn't anxiety all those years ago?\u00a0\u00a0What if it was the beginning of MS and I missed it. . .What if my doctors today don;t take me seriously. . .what if, what if, what if?They say if a person has one auto-immune disease, they are more prone to another. . .is the Graves a precursor for the MS?Thanks for listening!",
