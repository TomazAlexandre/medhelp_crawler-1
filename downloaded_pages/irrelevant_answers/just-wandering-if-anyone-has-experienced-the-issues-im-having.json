    "question": "So I'm 38 years old and have had a very active sex life up to around 6 years ago. I gave up on the hunt or the longing for a relationship or sexual activity. Literally to the point to where I had one or two if any sexual encounters per year. Here recently I have become more sexually active and I'm having issues with ED. I would say looking back I may have had issues in the past two years but it was nothing I couldn't overcome with a little more foreplay. Now currently with the love of my life where I feel like I'm more open, honest and trusting than I've ever been in the past I'm having extreme issues. Sometimes I lose an erection during intercourse and sometimes I lose an erection just starting intercourse. Alcohol is not a major factor as I never have more than two drinks. I have been stressed out at work but all that seems to be getting better. It's almost like I'm losing my concentration level or my mind is cluttered with garbage I can't even decipher when it happens. It also seems like I have an aching in one or both testicles semi regularly.Any responses would be appreciated.",
