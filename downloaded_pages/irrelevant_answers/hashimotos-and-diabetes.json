            "answer": "I was dx with hypothyroidism in Jun 08 and am also on synthroid (currently 75 mcg).\u00a0\u00a0I have a problem at times with low blood sugar (weak, shaky, nauseated, etc) and I also had symptoms of some high blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I have been thinking I might have a problem with insulin resistance because of weight that I haven't been able to get rid of.\u00a0\u00a0I bought a glucometer and I was right - my blood sugar levels have been bouncing all over the scales with no real rhym or reason.\u00a0\u00a0I was sent for a glucose tolerance test last week and now awaiting results.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that I might be dealing with a pre-diabetes situation and have been trying to change my eating to a diabetic diet and try to eat small frequent meals in an effort to keep my blood sugar more stable.Do definitely contact your doctor about this.\u00a0\u00a0There could also be other causes.",

            "answer": "I was dignosed with hashimotos hypothyroid Oct 07. Since then I have been seeing a doctor regularly with the same complaints (nasea,headaches,shakes,dizzyness,and constant thirst) She never came up with a diganosis that helped to sum it up She is a terible doctor.I just switched doctors and within 30mins of talking with Her giving Her all the same\u00a0\u00a0symptoms that I had been giving my previous doctor She ran some labs tested my urine and I have now been told I have diabetes Insipidus.It has to do with the pituitary glad. I am know scheduled for an MRI to see what causing it but am thinking its the same thing that is causing my hashimotos (Autoimune).My antibodies got bored atacking just my thyroid and decided to go for my pituitary also.Get it checked and listen to your self I have definantley learned you have to take your health care into your own hands because sometimes you get a doctor who just dosn't care.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis 3/2008 and have been taking 50mg of Synthroid since then.\u00a0\u00a0I have always had times when I would shake and become nauseated if I didn't eat my meals regularly, but a little OJ would clear it right up.\u00a0\u00a0I am finding more and more that I suffer from nausea and tremors in my hands after I eat anything.\u00a0\u00a0I understand that diabetes and thyroid issues are linked and I was wondering if maybe I should bring up these symptoms during my next appointment with my endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0I'm so tired of feeling this way!\u00a0\u00a0I have my thyroid levels checked every three months and each time the levels have remained consistent.\u00a0\u00a0Could these symptoms be pre-diabetic or am I simply overreacting to my normal hypothyroidism woes?\u00a0\u00a0Please, if you have experienced the same or similar, share some thoughts to ease my worries.Thank you,Chrssy264",
