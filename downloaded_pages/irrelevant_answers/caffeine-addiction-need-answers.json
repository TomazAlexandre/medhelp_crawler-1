            "answer": "Hi,All you are going through, the coffee/caffeine has to take the blame. What you suffer from when you are not having coffee is known as \u201cWithdrawal Symptoms\u201d which manifests as headache, jitteriness, craving for coffee. Coffee is quite addictive. You know, the youngsters nowadays are addicted to soft drinks like coke, Pepsi due to high caffeine content in them. Each can of Coke contains 3 times caffeine than a cup of coffee. Well, you need to gradually decrease your intake of coffee. If you suddenly stop taking coffee, you\u2019ll have these withdrawal symptoms which will make you drink coffee, hence my suggestion will be to gradually decrease the intake of the same.Some patients do have a slowing of heart rate with the intake of coffee but in majority it causes a rapid pulse.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted.Warm regards.",

    "question": "So I used to drink pop/coffee once in a while, you know a couple cans or a cup of coffee a week, but this year I drink A LOT of it. I can go through those 24 packs of pop in probably a week. And when I have coffee, its not just a cup, its at LEAST a half a pot. I do sort of notice that when I don't have anything, I start to get a headache and it is immediately relieved once I drink some pop or coffee. So this means I'm addicted right? To the caffeine?I just had a can of pop and its gone in less than 5 minutes. I've read that a lot of caffeine can cause your heart to race, and you can get shaky, etc. but I've noticed its the opposite for me. My heart rate is slower when I drink pop/coffee than when I don't. Is it just that my body is so used to it? I tried just quiting cold turkey, so I went without caffeine for 2 days, but then I really got a bad headache. It not only helps if I get a headache, but I really crave it! So what do you think? Am I addicted?How can I get away from not drinking so much of it? Im trying to have less, but I used to drink at least 4 cans of pop a day, on top of some days having coffee too.",
