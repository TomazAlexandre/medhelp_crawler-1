            "answer": "It is not just the medication that is lowering your blood sugar, but the diet as well. So that is a double whammy. So I should think the quick drop is normal. The question is how high is your fasting blood sugar and do you ever show symptoms of low-blood sugar. By the way, some people can control type II diabetes with diet alone. If while on your diet your blood sugar starts dropping too fast, see your doctor. He/She may want to reduce your medication.",

            "answer": "No apologies needed for asking questions. Everyone when first diagnosed with diabetes has tons of questions. We here to help answer them the best we can.First off, you are testing at the incorrect time. These are the test times:1. Fasting - first thing in morning before breakfast and before having any colored liquids [tea, coffee, milk, sodas]. Water is OK. This will provide you with a baseline and also an insight on what your body is doing while sleeping.Normal levels - 60/70 to 99 mg/dlPrediabetes - 100 to 125 mg/dlDiabetes - >125 mg/dl2. Preprandial - Before meals, lunch and dinner/supper. Again provides a baseline measurement. Use this vs your postprandial [after meal test] to see how the foods you ate affected your glucose [blood sugar] levels.Normal levels - 60/70 to 99 mg/dl3. Postprandial - Test 2-3 hours after eating. This is when sugars from foods you ate have plateaued in your body. Waiting longer as you did, glucose is on the decline and you end up with a false/positive inaccurate reading.Normal levels - <99 mg/dlDiabetes - Aim for <141 mg/dl, optimum <121 mg/dl. Above 141 mg/dl is not good. Web sites proclaiming it's OK to be as high as181 mg/dl are sponsored by drug companies who want your levels high. The higher your levels the more drugs you need. The more drugs you need the more drugs you buy. The more drugs you buy the more profit they make.4. Bedtime - Measure against fasting levels. Going to bed with high glucose levels means 1/3 of your day is spent with higher than normal levels. You want to be as close to normal as possible. Going to bed with high levels means you have spent 1/3 of your day with higher than normal glucose levels. Not healthy.Read other threads on this forum to educate yourself on foods to avoid and foods to thrive on. And do some sort of physical exercise 30 minutes daily to help lower your glucose levels and to help maintain proper body weight.If you have further questions feel free to post back here.",

    "question": "Hello, I was just diagnoised having type 2 diabetes last Friday. My blood levels were at 345 after fasting. Doc put me on 500mg of metformin twice a day. I begin dieting Saturday. My sugar levels are dropping rapidly. Just after 3 days, about 30 minutes ago, my results were 132. This is 4 hours after eating lunch. My question is, is it normal for it to drop this quickly? Do I need to be concerned that it drops to low? Also, I was using the restroom up to 7 times a night before, and now just after 2 days on this medicine, I only went once the past 2 nights. Is this normal? Sorry with all the questions, but I am new to all of this. Thanks for any advice.",
