I told her about the forum-- she said \"not right now\".I asked her why and she said she was trying to divert attention to other things--it looks like it's working for her--so whatever works.We found an out patient rehab place and we will be attending NA ... If we can't find NA, then we will go to AA.I am standing by her and watching over like a mother hen--BUT I also know she needs her own space...It's Working pretty good--because she is talking to me more and opening up to me--- gosh, that's been a long time since she did that...I'm glad ya'll are here, cause I need support, too!!!THank you allBest wishes to all !!!",

    "question": "Hello,I am new here. My 27 year old daughter has been addicted to mainly hydrocodone and probably some other drugs, but mainly hydrocodone.Addicted for about 3 years and taking\u00a0\u00a0high doses of hydrocodone.I took her to a rehab place and they recommended \"methadone\" treatment. I know they are the experts, but to me, it just doesn't make sense to replace one addictive drug with another addictive drug.We told them we would research this and in the meantime, she is doing this cold turkey.She has juvenile diabetes.Someone told me that methadone might cause more harm since she is has Type 1 diabetes.Regardless, I am opposed to her taking methadone. Just doesn't make sense.I am trying to get her into a decent rehab place as an \"In patient\".In the meantime, she is\u00a0\u00a0beginning her 5th day of\u00a0\u00a0detox.I told her to drink lots of water. Don't know anything about this\u00a0\u00a0PHYSICAL withdrawal.What do I expect??Someone said 2 weeks for physical withdrawal and then --- mental.I want to help her during the physical withdrawal--an of course , the mental which I understand takes a very , very long time.Is this life threatening because of her juvenile diabetes?Is there anything I can do to help her thru this??So far, the withdrawals have not been bad......What should I expect??Please help me help my daughter!\u00a0\u00a0And YES-- SHE WANTS HELP.Thank you for any info or advice.",
