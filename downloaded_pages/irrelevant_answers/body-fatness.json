        {
            "answer": "No, you have the thyroid idea wrong --- sometimes the thyroid malfunctions and produces either too much of thyroxine (T4) and/or triodethyronine (T3).\u00a0\u00a0These hormones control your body temperature, your heart rate and your metabolism.\u00a0\u00a0If your levels of these hormones is too high, you will not be able to gain weight, and in fact, may continue to lose weight.Aside from the weight issue, too much thyroid hormone can cause very rapid heart rate, raise your body temperature, cause fatigue, as well as other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0The tests you need to ask for are Free T4, Free T3, TSH, TPOab, TGab and TSI.A blood sugar test would measure the level of sugar in your blood -- a glucose tolerance test would be good........also a test called A1c, which measures what your blood sugar has ranged over a period of 2-3 months.\u00a0\u00a0You might also want to ask for a test to check your insulin levels......if you would have diabetes (high blood sugar/not enough insulin) this could also cause weight loss or inability to gain...I know this is all confusing and I want to make sure that you understand -- I am not a doctor -- just a fellow person who has medical issues that cause weight problems.Since this is a Weight Loss and Dieting community, rather than a \"medical\" forum, please feel free to send me a PM and I will try to give you more information.I look forward to hearing from you.........",
