            "answer": "Hi!Since you have burning sensation in both upper legs, either there is wrong transmission of weight due to improper posture with the prosthesis or there is a pinched nerve in the lower back. Physiotherapy and exercises may help. Other than this, it can also be peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or thyroid problems or lupus etc. Please discuss all these possibilities with your treating doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
