            "answer": "Hi,It would be best to discuss the findings on the cystoscopy with your doctor. If the area was suspicious and the biopsy is equivocal, then it may be an indication to repeat the biopsy. Bladder cancers tend to start from the surface, so odds are the biopsy would be adequate. What is more difficult to ascertain is how deep any given cancer has invaded the layers of the bladder wall as the biopsy may not have sampled deep enough. Stay positive.",
