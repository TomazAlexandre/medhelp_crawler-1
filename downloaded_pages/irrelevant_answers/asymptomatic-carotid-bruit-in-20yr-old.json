            "answer": "A carotd bruit may occur as the result of carotid artery stenosis however, most carotid bruits, particularly those found in younger or asymptomatic patients, are not related to any disease and are termed \"innocent carotid bruits\". A carotid bruit is unlikely to be heard if the stenosis occludes less than 40% of the diameter of the artery. Likewise, a stenosis of greater than 90% may not be heard, as the flow may be too low. Many carotid bruits are discovered incidentally in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. The presence of a carotid bruit alone does not necessarily indicate the presence of stenosis, and the physical examination cannot be used to estimate the degree of stenosis, if present; therefore, any bruit must be evaluated by ultrasound or imaging.",

    "question": "Hey there!I didn't know where to post this so I'm just gonna put it here... I hope my English is understandable haha... anyway here it goes. I'm currently a 20yr old medical student, somehow I incidentally discovered\u00a0\u00a0a right carotid bruit, its easy to auscult (diastolic), you can actually feel the thrill... I'm currently asymptomatic, yet I'm worried... I've been researching about it... I used to be fat but I'm way too young for early atheroesclerosis disease, there's no history of stroke or miocardial infarction in my family or any lipid disorders... I dont have any other morbidities, but yes I've got diabetes history in mi family.I've decided to get an US Doppler done. I visited my endocrinologist but he didn't really catch the bruit because it's kind of deeply buried by the right clavicle, it sounds pretty loud to auscultation, guess I should visit a cardiologist or a vascular surgeon...Just wanted to share this experience, does anybody suffer something alike? Any suggestions or similar cases would help.Thx everyone!",
