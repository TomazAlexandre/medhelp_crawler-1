            "answer": "My two cents worth is that you need the real-time support of a specialist in diabetes who you can physically be with at least once a week at the beginning, and thence every month or so. We could go on playing \"internet tag\" for hundreds of messages and you would not get the benefit you would recieve from such a program.\u00a0\u00a0Usually the people who run these are not physicians but trained R.N.'s or physician assistants. There are thousands of diabetic clinics with knowledgeable nurses on staff who will assist you with dietary planning, medications and testing protocols.\u00a0\u00a0And assisting in setting up a customized treatment schedule. You have to find one.",

            "answer": "The best way to manage pre-diabetes is with a combination of exercise, maintaining a healthy weight and lowering your carb intake. There is lots of information out there about carbs, but basically you need to eliminate sugar and lower intake of things such as bread, rice, potatoes and cereal. Consider getting a home meter and measuring your blood sugar two hours after some meals in order to learn how different foods affect your blood sugar. The goal is to remain below 140 after eating.Many people are able to manage diabetes with exercise, stable weight and proper eating for many years, but diabetes is a progressive disease.",

        {
            "answer": "No, that is not what I said. Diabetes is a progressive disease. If you deal with diet, exercise and weight control on an ongoing basis you will be able to control your numbers that way for a period of time. Eventually you will need oral medications and eventually insulin. You are already pre-diabetic. The better you do at managing your blood sugar with diet, exercise and weight control, the longer you may be able to go without the need for oral meds. Everyone is different so nobody can give you exact numbers about how how long the progression of your diabetes will take. Just focus on making changes, learning how food affects you and testing. Knowing that you are pre-diabetic puts you ahead of the game in being able to start this process early on and not wait until you are further along. Diabetes-at whatever stage-is a manageable disease. Complications can be avoided by using the proper tools to control blood sugar. Right now your tools are diet, exercise and weight control. Down the road you may need other tools. Make sense?",

            "answer": "Got it!.I don't know why I am prediabetic. I don't have family history of diabetes and I always have been within a normal range of weight. I usually don't take a lot of sugar or sugary drinks. But as you said, everyone is different. I have started a exercise and I have lost already 2 pounds in one week now. Hope to be at 165 pounds by August. I am going to get a glucose home meter to be sure that what I am doing is on the right wayThanks a lot!",
