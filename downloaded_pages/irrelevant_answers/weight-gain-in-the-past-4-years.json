            "answer": "Thyroid symptoms can be present long before blood tests show a problem, but then many doctors only test TSH, not the actual thyroid hormones, plus most labs use outdated reference ranges for TSH, so your doctor could look at it and see that it's \"in range\", but could be very high in the range.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, on the off chance that your actual thyroid hormones are being tested, they could be very low in the ranges, which\u00a0\u00a0may not be optimal for you.\u00a0\u00a0You should get retested for, at least, TSH, Free T3 and Free T4, as well as thyroid antibodies, which would indicate an autoimmune thyroid disease.Additionally, even though tests for diabetes came back negative, you could have insulin resistance, which means that you produce enough insulin, but your body doesn't use it properly.",

            "answer": "You might want to check out the thyroid forum, here on MedHelp, and post your actual thyroid hormone results, with reference ranges.\u00a0\u00a0Members can then help assess your situation better.800 calories/day is almost never enough and can put your body into \"starvation mode\", which means it will hang onto fat stores already present, because it knows there's not enough food coming in. Calorie intake must be calculated for your own individual needs, based on weight, height, age and level of activity, not just an arbitrary figure.You need a balance of lean protein, low/no fat dairy, lots and lots of veggies, whole grains, \"good\" fats, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Limit fruit to 1-2 servings/day, as fruit has a lot of sugar that turns to fat, if not used quickly. Opt for whole fruit, rather than juices, since whole fruit also has fiber, etc.Additionally, you need to be adding exercise to your daily routine. A combination of strength/weight training and cardio.I'm sorry your family are so rude about this.\u00a0\u00a0If you have a medical condition that prevents you from losing weight, you will need to get it sorted out.You might want to think about seeing a nutritionist to make sure you are getting enough of the right types of food.Many people find that if they keep a food diary, they realize that they are actually eating a lot more calories than they think, so you could try that. Writing down everything that goes into your mouth, whether it be a sip of soda,\u00a0\u00a0\"taste testing\" at the stove while you're cooking, cleaning up the kids' plates, etc can be a real eye opener.So can tracking your exercise, because we often don't burn as many calories as we think we should have.\u00a0\u00a0Med Help has both an excellent food diary and exercise tracker.",
