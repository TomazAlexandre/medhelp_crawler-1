            "answer": "Hi Chit,It can be very confusing.\u00a0\u00a0The data for people with known coronary artery disease (CAD), people with major risk factors for CAD (in the heart protection study), and people after heart attacks is very good.\u00a0\u00a0Just about everyone with CAD or previous heart attack should be on a statin, regardless of there LDL barring contraindications to the medication.\u00a0\u00a0If you have CAD or major risk factors for CAD (diabetes plus one other risk factor), you should probably be on a statin.If you are taking a statin for prevention of future events, don't have many risk factors and haven't had a heart attack, it is reasonable to treat the triglycerides only.\u00a0\u00a0Your LDL is very good at 93, although this may be while you were on the statin.Management of lipids can be very complicated and has to be done in the context of your risk factor profile.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this response helps.",

            "answer": "I've reduced my trigs from an avg of 225 to 100, my total cholesterol from 160 to 128, my ldls from 70 to 55 (on average) by just eating oat bran cereal once to twice a day and by taking omega III capsules (otc--fish oil like)...I also just take 100 mgs of Niacin (generic otc).\u00a0\u00a0The Omega III is taken after meals and work up to 2 capsules after each meal...they are not for everyone as they may thin the blood just as Niacin is not for everyone and you may get the flush as I did (esp when taking with the Omega IIIs).Oat bran (not oat meal) is harmless.\u00a0\u00a0Read the 8 week cholesterol cure...A great book.",

    "question": "My triglyceride is 186, HDL 39, LDL 93 and VLDL 37. I'm currently taking Zocor 10 mg which has decreased my total cholesterol from 215 to 170. However my triglyceride has remained high through the years. My doctor is switching me from Zocor to Tricor.Reduction of cardiovascular mortality seems to be well documented for statins. However, my understanding is that Tricor (fenofibrate) has never been proven (i.e. more than just mildly successful or nowhere near the statin numbers) to reduce cardiovascular diseases, deaths, PVCs and/or arterial plaque formation. Is this true?If true, then although Tricor will bring down my triglycerides, isn't it more prudent to be taking statins instead as the goal should be to reduce my risk of cardiovascular diseases/death and not a number on my blood test?",
