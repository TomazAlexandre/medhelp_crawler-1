He's 20.He had both big toe nails removed, and he's going through the same thing as you.It's really up to you on how you would like to be treated.My son refuses to see a doctor.Try the alternative therapies forum for some ideas on non-medicinal treatments.If they say anything that may conflict with things you know better than to do ( such as telling you to eat sugar ) then see your doctor.We all know how important it is to protect your feet when you have diabetes.You could also try the diabetes forum for ideas as well.",

    "question": "I am a 19 year old type 1 diabetic and recently had an ingrown toe, the wound from that is basically healed up and progressing nicely (thank god) but now all this dead (I guess?) skin around the toe has come off and I'm left with half my toe covered in the normal layer of skin and half of the toe (big toe btw) missing the first layer or two of skin!And this afternoon after I had a shower I noticed a small area of dry/dead skin on the bottom of this same toe and removed it which may not have been a good idea because now there too I am missing the first layer or two of skin (couple centimetres total diameter / width)What can I do to aid and speed up the growth of new skin? I cannot afford any foot problems.Do you think given my age I'll be ok with home remedies or should I make an appointment with a doctor? Nothing is infected.",
