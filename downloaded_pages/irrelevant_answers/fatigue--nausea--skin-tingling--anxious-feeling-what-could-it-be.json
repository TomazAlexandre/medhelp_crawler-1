            "answer": "It sounds like you have a lot going on.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, this could be caused by generalized anxiety disorder but the other symptoms you are describing (the weight gain, the sugar levels, abnormal body reactions....etc) make me think that you either have something else going on as well or something else entirely.\u00a0\u00a0Two things that come to mind are either something wrong with your thyroid or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I would reccoment that you see a doctor and ask for a blood panel to be done to check your thyroid and blood sugar at the very least.\u00a0\u00a0I also would let your doctor know that you are having severe (at least it sounds to me like severe) anxiety symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0An anti-anxiety medication might be a solution short term.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this is helpful.\u00a0\u00a0Please take care of yourself.\u00a0\u00a0And if you have more questions please send me a message.",

            "answer": "I strongly suggest you see your doctor for a complete physical and blood panel. While you may have some symptoms of anxiety, it seems more likely to me that any anxiety is stemming from how you're feeling.Even if we listed some OPINIONS about what MIGHT be causing these symptoms, the bottom line is that you would still be advised to see your doctor.Go to the person who can tell you FOR SURE.PeaceGreenlydia",

    "question": "I am a 29 year old male. About 2 weeks ago I started noticing what felt like bugs (fleas) jumping on my skin. There are no bugs to be seen or even there as my wife, who sleeps beside me, hasn't noticed anything. This symptom has taken a backseat now to other more serious symptoms, namely constant nausea and what I would call 'anxiety' (although when this anxiety happens I still know everything is ok but my body is acting abnormal despite this). This anxiety is often accompanied by me feeling like I can't think normally. The worst part is that now (about three days into all of these symptoms) I am very fatigued and lack energy. Also, I have, over the past 3 months or so, gained some weight in my stomach and chest. However that could be from lack of excercise. Also, my sugar levels are not good for my age. Thanks for any suggestions or help.",
