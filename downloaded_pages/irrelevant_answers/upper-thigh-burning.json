            "answer": "Hi!In females above 40 years it can be a symptom of menopause or premenopause. Peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes too should be looked into. Fibromyalgia is another possibility. At localized points it can also be a sign of deep vein thrombosis, especially if it is in legs and thigh. This would need a comprehensive investigation. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 45 yr old female with Diabetes. I have experienced a severe burning pain in the upper front of the thigh, at the very top of the leg. When touched lightly this pain can increase and feels like there is a small 'lump' in the area. This comes on when standing or walking for a period of time and is bad enough that I have to sit. Any suggestions would be great, thank you",
