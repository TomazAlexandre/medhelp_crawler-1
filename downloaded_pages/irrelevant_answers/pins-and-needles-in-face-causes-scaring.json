            "answer": "Hello,From the symptoms the possibility of parasthesia needs to be ruled out. They are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not. If the symptoms persist then please get it evaluated from a dermatologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Thank you very much for your answer. My dermatologist just ignores the sympoms as he says it's due to the reaccutane. However I went to see him because of the problem and was put on reaccutane. The pins and needles started before I went to see him. I've been on acne meds for 10 years because but it has not stopped the problems being red marks on my face that starts small and gets bigger and bigger burns badly and scars. Theres usually no pimple around that area and I dont not touch my face. Meds so far has not helped the to stop the scarring. My face is scared so badly and the red inflamed areas keeps getting bigger and bigger- about size of a golf ball and is scarring",
