            "answer": "Dear Sweetpea,I'm sorry you're having such stressful issues with your little girl. I'm the mom of a diabetic teen, not a doctor, so keep that in mind, but yes, if I were you I would get a second opinion. Juvenile diabetes does not \"run\" in my family-- it's the last thing in the world I ever worried about-- and yet my daughter developed type-1 diabetes at age 14. It sounds irresponsible to me to sayd that a child is \"not at risk\" if diabetes doesn't \"run in the family.\" It's a lot more complicated than that.It wouldn't hurt to ask your pediatrician for a referral to an endocrinologist, and then take your daughter in for a look-see. She may indeed be perfectly fine, but that's the only way to find out for sure and ease your mind.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Go to the doctor immediately and demand a blood sugar test. If her blood glucose levels are dangerously high, she could become very ill. Your daughter has a lot of symptoms of Type 1 diabetes, and family history is not necessarily an indicator.\u00a0\u00a0There is NO history of diabetes -- either Type 1 or Type 2 -- in my family and my son developed Type 1 three years ago at the age of 6. Find a medical professional who is more knowledgeable, and do it today!",

            "answer": "I have a question about my 4.5yr old son. My son has always drank more than he eats and urinates more than other kids. We had urine tests done a few months ago and the first came back positive for elevated protein but not sugar. Subsequent tests and blood tests have come back fine. My wife and I are still nervous because of the drinking and urinating but also that he still naps. He is definately not a lazy kid, but still likes to nap almost every day. He is very small and doesn't gain much weight. What are your guys opinions on his symptoms. I know you aren't doctors but any help would be great.Thanks.",

    "question": "My 5 year old daughter has been waking up at night to urinate and to drink at least twice every night.\u00a0\u00a0She is itchy all over and always thirsty and peing all the time.\u00a0\u00a0The past month or so she has been sick with upset stomach and headaches.\u00a0\u00a0Three weeks ago she had what the doc call a bad bug.\u00a0\u00a0She had diarreah and vomitting.\u00a0\u00a0We went back and forth to the doc because they were treating me like I was just an overconcerned parent.\u00a0\u00a0Well when I demanded that they do something they ran some test and said some number that involves her pancreas was very high.\u00a0\u00a0They kept her in the hospital for 2 nights and said she was fine.\u00a0\u00a0When I informed them of the other symptoms they just said if we don't have a history of childhood diabetes in our families then she is not at risk.\u00a0\u00a0Should I be concerned, or should I find another doctor?\u00a0\u00a0Also when I was pregnant with her I had gestational diabetes, and at birth she had to go to the NICU for low blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Please help ease my mind.",
