This has to do with the rigid GPCTL not wrapping around the cornea as it becomes steeper.Stay very very close to highly qualified Eye MD ophthalmologists as you are at risk for a host of eye problems of the retina and due to your glaucoma as you get older.JCH III MD",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with glaucoma four years ago and was immediately put on Xalatan once a day both eyes. Two years later was taken off Xalatan and put on Cosopt & Alphagan, twice a day, Lumigan once a day, both eyes. For the past two years my diopter went from -4.00 both eyes, to -9.50 left eye, -7.00 right eye, as of today, in steady progression.\u00a0\u00a0I can already tell I'm probably not seeing 20/40 presently and need stronger contacts. (Acuvue 2 soft lenses, replaced once a month)I was checked for diabetes on advice by the eye doctor, 2006 & 2007 and had average glucose levels ( about 84 mg/dl & 76 mg/dl the second time).Q. What could be causing my rapid myopia? I've worn contacts since 1973 ( gas perm from 1980 through 2003) with vary little diopter changes. 2003 till now the Acuvue 2 soft lenses.Could the contect lenses or any or combination of the glaucoma medications cause this? Could the glaucoma be causing my rapid increase im myopia?The interoccular pressure is kept at 18 to 22 in both eyes with the medication. Without medication the numbers can go up to 40.\u00a0\u00a0I did lose some vision in right eye as this was the visit in 2003 where the doctor discovered I had glaucoma.",
