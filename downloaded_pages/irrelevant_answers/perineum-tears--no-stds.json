            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to dryness of the area but if you notice any grey or white patches then lichen sclerosus should be ruled out. Lichen sclerosus is an uncommon disease of unknown cause that results in white patches on the skin, which may cause scarring, preferentually on and around genital skin.However it can cause ivory white dry patches on non genital areas also.Confirmation can be done only after skin biopsy. In my opinion you should get this rash evaluated from a dermatologist and get a skin biopsy done.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi girls. So for about a year.and a half I have been experiencing papercutting like tears in the perineum after using the toilet. I've been tested for herpes multiple times by both swab and blood. They come up after doing a poo. I've tried fibre supplements creams etc but its still happening. I know alot of women suffer this and im wondering if anyone ever found an underlying cause or a way to prevent it happening. I've been thyroid tested diabetes,.all stds etc. I know for a fact I have candida galbravata currently and have been disdiagnosed as candida slogans for almost a year. I also live in a terribly humid climate on the tropics, I also smoke. If anyone has a solution please please share!I think its a skin issue... I plan on getting biopsied for lichen sclerosis.",
