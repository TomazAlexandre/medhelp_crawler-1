            "answer": "Dear Lisa:Sorry to hear about your numbness, but with the limited information it is very difficult to tell you about what might be the etiologies.\u00a0\u00a0Providing that your in good health, no diabetes, arthritis, HIV, lyme disease, etc. it is problematic.\u00a0\u00a0The negative CT scan would indicate that a hemorrhage, tumor in the supratentorial space, large AVM, etc are not the cause of our problem.\u00a0\u00a0However, there are many subtle things missed on a CT and you are correct in thinking that a MRI might be required.\u00a0\u00a0Medication can also cause parasthesias.\u00a0\u00a0Post-infection processes as well as infection can cause numbness.\u00a0\u00a0Problems with the cervical spine can cause one-sided numbness.\u00a0\u00a0So, as you can tell there are many, many things to think about.\u00a0\u00a0A good neurological exam, some preliminary tests, and a good neurological history will go a long way in beginning the process of narrowing down the possible diseases that can give you your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry, I am not much of a help.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

    "question": "I am a 30 year old female.\u00a0\u00a0About 3 months ago, I started feeling a numbness on the left side of the back of my head.\u00a0\u00a0Over the months, it has spread to the front of my face, my arm, and even my leg. (Left side only) Even the left side of my tongue has felt numb briefly (just a couple of times).\u00a0\u00a0I had a CT scan of the brain ordered by my family doctor about a month ago...normal.\u00a0\u00a0I had an echocardiogram, stress test, EKGs....all normal.\u00a0\u00a0For several years, the muscles in my neck and back (mainly upper) are really tight and sore.\u00a0\u00a0They even cause headaches (not real severe).\u00a0\u00a0The muscle soreness and tightness\u00a0\u00a0seems to be worse on the left side.\u00a0\u00a0I am sceduled to see a neurologist next week.\u00a0\u00a0Just wanted some insight.\u00a0\u00a0I have also been under an extreme amount of stress for the last two years, but I can't see that causing the numbness.\u00a0\u00a0I realize I will probably have to have an MRI done and other things.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for you time in providing some information.Lisa",
