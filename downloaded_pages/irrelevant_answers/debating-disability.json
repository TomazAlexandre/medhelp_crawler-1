            "answer": "Will disability pay you throughout your pregnancy and for your 6 weeks after? My STD company will only pay for a total of 26 weeks in one year, so if I were in your situation I wouldn't be able to take leave yet but if you can handle it financially then I'd do what you think is best. Maybe start your leave at 16 weeks?",

            "answer": "Definitely look into it. Short term is usually only for 12 weeks I think and then long term kicks in, if you have it. Another thing is, will you be able to keep your job being out that long. Does your doctor feel it is safe for you to be doing that job? If not, maybe they could switch you to a desk job temporarily until after the pregnancy. A lot to think about, but of course you want what's best for you and your baby. Good luck!",

            "answer": "I'm union. We have a lot of benefits so I would be paid the whole time. And they don't allow desk jobs unless you're hurt on the job. Think I'll stick it out till I start my shots at least, as long as I can keep my gestational diabetes under control.",

    "question": "I'm 10 1/2 weeks right now. I'm slightly high risk for premature labor around 28 weeks due to bicornuate uterus( uterus split in two). I have to start progesterone shots by 16 weeks. I drive special needs kids so I do a lot of bouncing on the bus. My last pregnancy seemed to go well. Should I suck it up and start disability, or should I try to work like other pregnant women do? I went on disability last time for a subchorionic hemorrhage that was bad. I don't have one this time.",
