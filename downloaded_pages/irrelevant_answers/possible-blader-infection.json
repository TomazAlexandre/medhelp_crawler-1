            "answer": "I would personally would talk to a doctor or someone right away. People with \"diabetes\" are more susceptible to urinary tract infections and pregnant women are more likely to have the infection spead to their kidneys. There are antibiotics that you cannot take while pregnant but it is still best to get the opinion of a doctor. I do not want to scare you but as you know pregnancy women do have a \"lowered\" immune system, plus with the physical changes that occur within the urinary tract system while pregnant (dilated urethra, increase bladder volume decrease bladder tone etc etc) and coupled with hormones makes any infection more serious then when you are not pregnant. These infections when serious can cause premature delivery of the baby and high blood pressure.A natural remedy would have to change the pH of your bladder (pH >7). Eat probiotic yoghurt to supply some good bacteria and see if you can find unsweetened cranberry juice or ask about cranberry tablets. Of course drink lots of water 12 cups a day to flush your bladder. But it is best to chat with a doctor to see if you have bacteria in your urine.",

    "question": "Uh Oh,I'm starting to feel like I'm on my way to a bladder infection. Normally I would start power drinking cranberry juice to pre-empt this problem but Cranberry juice just sends my blood sugar CRAZY high (gestational diabetes).\u00a0\u00a0Anyone have any other natural remedies so I don't have to go to the docs for a rx?TIA,Joanne",
