            "answer": "kelcia,Thanks for the post.Those valve findings are not very significant in the spectrum of severity. It is important to know if ouve had any disease such as rheumatic fever in the past, or any family history of hypertrophic cardiomypathy.\u00a0\u00a0Overall, the findings require regular followup, consideration of antibiotic prophyaxis with procedures, and strict control of your cardiac risk factors such as cholesterol and blood pressure.A valve can have some degree of stenosis and regurgitation at the same time. It sounds like your aotic valve may have both.\u00a0\u00a0Lupus can also be associated with all of the cardiac findings you mention.good luck",

    "question": "I am 43 yr. old. My medical history: LUPUS, COPD, HYPERTENSION , DIABETES. I have chest pain and my recently cardiac tests: Cardiac catheterization in October 2004, was normal (only 33% blocked) e no procedure done. Nuclear cardiology stress test: 06/2005: Left ventricular ejection fraction of 57%. Echocardiogram 07/2006 the results were as follows:Diastolic LV dimension\t4.72cmSystolic LV dimension\t2.95cmIntraventricular septum in diastolic\t1.29cmIntraventricular septum in systolic\t1.80cmLV posterior wall\t\t3.53cmAortic diameter\t3.53cmLeft atrium\t4.05cmLV fractional shortening\t39%LV ejection fraction\t7.0%LV mass\t\t266grams1. There is mild systolic dysfunction and mild left ventricular concentric hypertrophy.2. Doppler color shows mild regurgitation mitral valve and mild calcification in the mitral valve with left atrial enlargement3. Aortic valve shows mild calcification and trivial regurgitation with mild sub-aortic stenosis. There valve measures 1.45cm2 gradient of 7.6mmH4. Tricuspid valve shows trivial regurgitation .Tricuspid valve shows trivial regurgitationMedications: Laxis 40mg, Zestril 10mg (twice day), Hyzzar 100",
