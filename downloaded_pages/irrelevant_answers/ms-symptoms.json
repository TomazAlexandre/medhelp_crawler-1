            "answer": "Welcome to the forums.I'm sorry to hear of your symptoms and the duration.\u00a0\u00a0I am also sorry to hear of your Mother's passing.\u00a0\u00a0You have my deepest condolences.EMG is not a diagnostic test that determines MS or evaluates MS. In fact, it would steer away from MS if it came out positive.\u00a0\u00a0Other CNS diseases may cause positive EMG results.As far as your feet feeling swollen, I have that sensation as well with my entire left leg (in fact its doing it today along with muscle fasciculations/paresthesias).\u00a0\u00a0Although, my left leg does look a bit larger (not significantly) than the right.Your cold feeling in your feet and sensation of \"fullness\" or \"taut skin\" in your foot and/or feet is sensory.\u00a0\u00a0Since you do have nerve damage\u00a0\u00a0(according to your doctor and EMG results) then it would explain the sensations.I was wondering if you do have any cardiovascular disease, thyroid or endocrine (diabetes)?I wish you the bestLisa",
