            "answer": "Sometimes it's something you can't prevent. From here on out you will have to manage with diet and excercise and possibly medication. Stay away from sugars like soda and desserts. Drink lots of water. When you take the classes they will teach you how and what to eat. It is important to walk after meals it helps regulate your sugar. The important thing here is that you do what you can now for your baby. Most women the gd goes away after pregnancy. I'm diabetic before pregnancy and from the get go I had to follow diet and excercise and be more strict on myself. I'm very resistant so I am on insulin.\u00a0\u00a0But it's all worth it in the end to have a healthy baby. On my uktrasound My baby at 35 weeks was 6 pds 10 ounces and I will be induced at 39 weeks. With your sugar in control your baby shouldn't get too big. Good luck!",
