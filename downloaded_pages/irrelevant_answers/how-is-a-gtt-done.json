    "question": "Hello,After my blood test indicated elevated glucose my doctor just ordered a GTT to check for diabetes. Can someone please explain how this test is done. I assume it is a blood test again. Is it more complex, will I get the needle more than a usual blood test, if so, how many times? Is anything else involved?I really appreciate any help.",
