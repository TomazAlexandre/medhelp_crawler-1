            "answer": "Hm, it's a question what is going on here.Benadryl and especially prednisone should have at least some effect on itch if it was from hair dye allergy.Bactrim halped you, this speaks for a bacterial (staph or strep) infection of the skin. Swollen node in the neck is also not typicall for allergy but rather for infection.Do you have any rash? I'd recommend you to visit an infectologist.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Either your skin is very dry causing it to itch or you have some allergy other than that to hair color.Dry itchy skin is also known as xerosis. Simple daily routines like bathing, applying soaps and scrubbing yourself dry can decrease the moisture in the skin. You will have to choose a moisturizer suitable for your skin and apply it 2-3 times in a day. Also AC and heating depletes the skin of moisture, so if you stay for long hours in AC or heaters you should use a humidifier too. Use warm water and a mild soap for bathing. Petrolleum jelly used at night along with glycerine can help keep the skin supple and moist.Vitamin A deficiency and diabetes too can cause dry skin. Hence these should be ruled out.Urticaria or allergy is usually triggered by allergens, such as drugs, foods, insect bites, inhaled substances, in response to sunlight, cold, heat, stress, exercise, or a viral infection. Other common allergens are pollen, mold, dust, pet dander, or cosmetics. Since you experienced an itch, just go over these possibilities in your mind. Something may strike you. You must find out what you are allergic to by either a RAST test or a kin test.Consult an allergy specialist.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
