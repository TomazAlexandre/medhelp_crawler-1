            "answer": "OMG!\u00a0\u00a0Have you posted this in the Fibromyalgia community?\u00a0\u00a0This is way more than that, but maybe someone with worse Fibromyalgia than myself would know more.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, definitely take her to the E.R., but maybe still post in the Fibromyalgia community, because someone there might have some ideas.I would also take a chance with the complimentary medicine community and the auto immune community.I know she is in horrific pain, but I suspect those pain medicines are also contributing to the problems, such as the horrible swelling and the rash.\u00a0\u00a0I know the pain medicine isn't going to help with the Barret's Esophogus at all.\u00a0\u00a0That's one I have to watch out for, since that is usually caused by advanced GERD.I would fire the PCP.\u00a0\u00a0Your mother isn't really very old.\u00a0\u00a0She hasn't even reached \"senior\" status, yet.\u00a0\u00a0I would take her to an rheumatoid arthritis clinic or specialist.\u00a0\u00a0This kind of specialist is the kind someone with Fibromyalgia goes to if they also have the usual associated arthritis.\u00a0\u00a0It isn't surprising she has psoriasis with the Fibromyalgia either, since I've known several of my friends with FMS who also have psoriasis.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes, too.\u00a0\u00a0Something more than diabetes has to be going on with your mother if she hardly eats anything, and she shouldn't have gained so much weight only to have the PCP decide to give up on her.\u00a0\u00a0Definitely fire the PCP and get her a different one.For now, though, I agree that this is a definite emergency.\u00a0\u00a0If she has been to the same E.R. so many times that the doctors there don't blink an eye--take her to a totally different E.R.--even if this means a long drive to a different neighboring city or town where they don't know her.\u00a0\u00a0Fresh eyes might make a huge difference.",

    "question": "Hello. I am new to this whole online medical community, but I officially have no where else to go. I join this in hopes to help find an answer about my mothers conditions.My mother is 52 years old and is dying before our family's eyes. Over the past few years her problems have just taken a turn for the worse and no doctor will even take the time to run tests. Just yesterday I went into her pcp's office to try to get him to listen and he looked at me and said \"I don't want to help her.\"To get to the basics she has had a numerous amount of things diagnosed. She has asthma, fibermialysia,\u00a0\u00a0chronic pain, Long QT syndrome, Barret's (sp?) esophagus, eczema, psoriasis, panic disorder, and so much more I can't even list them all. She has a pacemaker and a pain pump in place. The pain pump was put in place last year for back injuries, ddd, and ruptured discs. This pumped seemed to only make matters worse.She has gain weight rapidly, over 150 lbs in 6 months, and we are lucky to get her to eat dinner at night. She has lost her ability to walk, her legs are swollen all the time, she can't stay awake for more than a minute. I am not exaggerating, you will be talking to her and she zones out, mumbles, falls asleep, and wakes up and doesn't even seem to know where she is. She loses her words constantly, and can't remember hardly anything. She can never breath, her mouth is constantly dry and cracked. The right side of her face seems to droop but the doctors says theirs no signs of a stroke. She has constant double vision and her pupils seems to have very minimal reaction to lights. She can't stand to be in a room hotter than 55 degrees and has put up black curtains cause she can't stand the sunlight. Her right breast is almost triple the size of her left and she has an awful rash underneath that looks like it's just eating away at her. If she so much as pokes her arm she screams in pain and bruises within the hour. As I mentioned she has had rapid weight gain but it is not the smushy fat, she is as hard a rock, you can't even push it in. Her stomach is extended to the point where she can't even sit up in her bed.Something is extremely wrong, and it's progressing FAST!If someone could give me idea of what is going on or some information as to how to get a doctor to help her I would forever thank you.",
