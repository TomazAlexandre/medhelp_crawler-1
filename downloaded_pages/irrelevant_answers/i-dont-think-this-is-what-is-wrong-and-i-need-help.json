            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for the question. Ropinrole is a dopamine agonist and can be taken with a recommended dose for Restless leg syndrome (RLS) & can be considered a safe dose. Usually cause of RLS is unknown, but it is essential that you consult your treating doctor before decreasing or stopping the recommended dose. Other reasons of RLS could be rheumatoid arthritis, kidney failure, diabetes or any underlying heart disorder. The leg pain of RLS typically eases with movement of the legs and becomes more evident at rest. Therefore, medicine dosage is usually prescribed before going to bed. Though there is no permanent cure of RLS, it is advisable that you take regular & sound sleep to get relief from your symptoms. Supplements of iron or vitamin deficiency certainly help in elderly patients with RLS to ease out symptoms. Other medications such as levodopa, bromocriptine, oxycodone may be tried to provide some relive in your symptoms. If your previous medicines are causing RLS, then they can be stopped or reducing the doses after consulting your treating doctor may help to control symptoms. Hope this information proves helpful to you. Take Care & Regards!!!",

            "answer": "Of course I am no doctor but sounds to me like you might have RLS and maybe something like adema and I believe that is a retention of fluids or blockages, would ask about it, Also sounds a bit like neuropathy which can be caused by diabetes and as never mentioned, many other diseases or exposures like chemicals or aluminum or even lime disease. If these are something you know are happening, like where you work maybe with a chemical or some blood test can find otherwise then this info might help you investigate.I have neuropathy and sometimes there is swelling around my ankles which really makes em hurt. I have bin told I might have adema but never diagnosed with it, but do have neuropathy and diabetes.Look into your daily life and see if there is anything you might be doing that could cause it or if there was an event like a tick bite. RLS and neuropathy are a strang thing, no one really knows how to fix it in many cases but there are pain meds for it, I find they dont work for me, some get some relief. Some of these leg problems like neuropathy are caused by auto immune diseases so dont stop where you are at, find out if it is an auto immune disease if you can, go to a neurologist, an indocrinologist, what ever it takes.I let my sore feet go on for years cos I thought it was just me being tired, when it got so bad I couldnt walk one day I went in to see if maybe this isnt just my mind and diabetes showed up in a blood test, weird thing is that neuropathy is so far still the only symptom I have of diabetes and if not for the sore feet, probably would not even know yet, three years later.Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Something interesting today....my doctor wanted to see if my Ferritin was off (which I posted in another forum because I don't know what any of this means and could use some help) because of the RLS.\u00a0\u00a0He was confused by the results, which isn't helping me any!\u00a0\u00a0He said my Ferritin was very low while my iron levels were very high!\u00a0\u00a0Can you make heads or tails of this?",

            "answer": "Not sure but my doctor is checking the same thing for some reason, will let you know what my answer is when it comes back to him.I dont know if I said it here but I have neuropathy and possibly adema which is not diagnosed for some reason altho it has bin said in conversation with my doctor and my legs act as if they have RLS because they need to move all night due to pain and tingling so really dont know if there is RLS or not. This is why I mentioned the neuropathy and adema to you for you to check out.Ferritin is a ubiquitous protein that stores iron and releases it in a controlled fashion so maybe you need some work on the protein to make your iron levels better. They have drugs for nearly everything so hopefully there is something to help with this to make your levels work with your body better. I am sure what he said might mean your iron, needs to be stored better because it is running rampant in your body rather then being stored as it should be for use as the body requires. Being a back yard doctor that I am HAHAHAHA, that is my best guess, let me know what comes of it, if he prescribes or tells you how to manage it, would be interesting to find out and maybe this is a cause for your legs problems, iron is a funny thing, too much or too little can alter the body a lot.Having just went to my doctor I found out from exrays ordered that I have some degenerative disks and degenerative left hip as well so some of the weird symptoms are being answered, this is giving me sciatica symptoms. Goes to show there is so much that could be a cause. Good luck with your results, hope it gets some action and helps to take away some of your problems soon.",

    "question": "I was told a few years ago that I have restless leg, but I'm beginning to wonder if that is actually what I have.\u00a0\u00a0My left leg swells really large during the day and it actually hurts it gets so swollen.\u00a0\u00a0And my legs hurt, like the muscles hurt and my ankles hurt.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, I do feel like I have to move them around like with restless leg, but it has gotten SO BAD, that the dosage of Ropinerole has been doubled, and my new doctor says that the dosage is way too strong.\u00a0\u00a0He asked me if I had gone to a neurologist and actually been diagnosed with RLS, and I told him no, so I think that's what will happen.My question is this:\u00a0\u00a0what else could be causing this?\u00a0\u00a0I have pain and swelling (abnormal, not like holding water, the entire leg swells), I have pain and numbness and tingling in my feet and ankles and my legs sometimes feel \"weak,\" almost like they aren't really there.\u00a0\u00a0They become very heavy, aslo.Any help?",
