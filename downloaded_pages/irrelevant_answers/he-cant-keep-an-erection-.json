            "answer": "Haha I'm sorry but this is absolutely ridiculous. Is it completely impossible to leave your marriage first before looking elsewhere and can't you do it with an unattached man this way so many people will not be hurt by your lies and betrayals. I feel like this is karma full force because you wind up with a man who can't fulfill your needs either. Its a beautiful thing.",

            "answer": "Hello, why won't your husband have sex with you. Maybe you should into that before you look elsewhere. Why do you think this justifies an affair? Have you tried masturbation? Leave the diabetic dude alone, maybe he feels bad that you are married. Lots of ED cases are subconcious.",
