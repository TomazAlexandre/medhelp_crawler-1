            "answer": "Thanks for your thoughts - I think it is joint pain. They have ruled out arthritis, so she is assuming that it is fibromyalgia. I worry because if it is actually something related to her neck which is affecting that one side, her pain isn't going to improve is she simply accepts it as fibromyalgia and gets no other help.",

            "answer": "By what means did they rule out arthritis, some types do not show much by way of blood tests or overt swelling. I have one of these types and I also believe docs are too quick to diagnose CFS/fibromyalgia just so as to avoid doing the real work of figuring out whats really wrong and treating it.",

    "question": "My mom has had paid on her right side only for the last couple of months. Her doctors have given her inconsistent information and opinions, including the following:-- possible early onset diabetes-- neck issue (she did have a fusion a number of years ago of vertabrae in her upper neck)-- depression-- fibromyalgia (including a recommendation that she buy Fibromyalgia For Dummies)Depression runs in the family and she has been anxious lately. Any advice on what we can do to narrow the diagnosis? I am afraid that she is a bit psychosymatic (sorry for mispelling) and the more she reads on fibromyalgia, the more she seems to have the symptoms.Thanks",
