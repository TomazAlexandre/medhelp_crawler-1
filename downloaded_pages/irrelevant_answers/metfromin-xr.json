            "answer": "There are various schools of thought. Take metformin with food to avoid stomach upset.Otherwise, it depends on your blood sugar readings, not your Hna1c readings.Without knowing your glucose level readings after eating it's hard to recommend a protocol.You need to get a meter and start to take blood readings at home.",

            "answer": "Let me qualify that. Of course it depends upon your hba1c, but decisions as to take 500mg or 1000 mg and the time to take that is best determined by daily glucose tests.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 5 years ago. My care is currently through my Family Doctor. My last two HA1C tests were 7.2 and 7.4, and creatinine was 1.1. I am taking Metformin XR, 1 gm twice a day, total of 2 grams (four 500 mg tablets). I take 1 gram in the morning and 1 at night. My blood sugars tend to run high in the morning and decrease during the day. I have no specific instructions whether to take at meals, with water, etc. Would it likely make any difference to take 1.5 grams at night and 0.5 in the morning, or take it with meals or with water. I asked this of my family doctor and she was uncertain if it would make a difference. I also take glimperide, enalapril for hypertension and Crestor for high cholesterol.Although I have great trust in my Family Doctor, I am making an appointment with an Endocinologist to get advice on my medications, but that is not for 5 weeks. I would like to know your opinion on how to take Metformin, although I realize ultimately I need to follow my Doctor's advise.",
