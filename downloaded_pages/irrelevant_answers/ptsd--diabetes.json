            "answer": "First of all, I am sorry you are having to deal with both issues.\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, thank you for your service.\u00a0\u00a0I'm no doctor but I can tell you without doubt, mood, stress can absolutely affect your blood glucose levels!Both my wife and I are diabetics and her endocrinologist just recently said that there is growing proof regarding stress affecting blood glucose levels.Your \"diabetic\" life will be easier if you pay special attention to your PTSD.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise seems to be a big help with both my wife and I.\u00a0\u00a0It helps PTSD and obviously affects the diabetes.Good luck and remember that it is all doable.",

            "answer": "While many people suffering with ptsd related hypoglycemic effects and diabetes, will benefit somewhat from various suggestions, notable improvement will not be experienced in most...Unless Adrenal Fatigue Syndrome (usually caused by unresolved biological and/or external stress and other factors) is addressed.(which is sadly not recognized by conventional endocrinology).The\u00a0\u00a0issue is that there might be a discrepancy between the real hypoglycemic experience with all the usual symptoms in adrenal fatigue sufferers and blood plasma levels being NORMAL above 70ml/dlFasting blood sugar and glucose tolerance test might be normal in many with AF.The more advanced the adrenal fatigue, the faster the drop of blood sugarlevels (below the hypoglycemic tolerance threshold) after having a meal.A healthy snack every 2-4 hours may help replenish sugar levels.If your diabetes\u00a0\u00a0did not precede your PTSD (not the diagnosis! as it might take a LONG time to dx ptsd) by a significant margin, there's a good chance your diabetes was caused or at least exasperated by Adrenal fatigue.And for this, you need to find a Holistic Endocrinologist or Functional Medicine Doctor, who will treat you outside the strict Conventional Endocrinology guidelines and protocols.Diabetes and hypoglycemia are just one part of the negative effects associated with adrenal fatigue.I suspect\u00a0\u00a0that many of your physical, mental & emotional issues related to PTSD are stemming from there!It is no surprise that\u00a0\u00a0most PTSD treatments are not successful and most sufferers remain in perpetual limbo.Best wishes to all.Niko",

    "question": "I have PTSD from Vietnam era service in the Navy. I have also been DX'ed with diabetes since 20111 which I have had under control through diet alone. Lately my sugar levels have been all over the place (low of 68, high of 235, Normal is 70 - 150) In looking over the data from my reading I noticed that the really high numbers seem to coincide with when I am stressed due to my PTSD symptoms.So now I am wondering if due to the PTSD my body is dumping glucose into my blood when I get stressed out causing these high reading?Anyone know if this might be the case?Dennis",
