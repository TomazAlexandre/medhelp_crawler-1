            "answer": "Depending on age, children's levels are a little higher than adults.I don't know if diabetes effects thyroid levels.\u00a0\u00a0 However, levels do and can fluctuate for many various reasons.\u00a0\u00a0As long as TSH fluctuates or changes within Labs reference range, I would assume it it would be of no concern.AACE 2006 (amended version) page 9 and the US Government 2004, has set the guidelines for diagnose for Overt Hypothyroidism and Levothyroxine therapy\u00a0\u00a0reasonable with a TSH Higher Than 10.\u00a0\u00a0TSH levels and treatment is also based on different factors and conditions, such as nodule/goiter.The\u00a0\u00a0AACE TSH 0.3-3.0 that everyone keeps referring to, is a target range once diagnosed and on meds.\u00a0\u00a0Not a diagnose level. AACE revised/amended version 2006 - page 9.Good luck with your boy! Keep him tested on a regular bases so if anything does show up it can be caught before problems occur.",
