            "answer": "I won't tell you that everything is going to be fine but I will tell you about my grandfather and hope that it helps you.My grandfather is 75 years old. 2 years ago, he had to have open heart surgery, 3 months before my wedding. I live across the country from him so I couldn't even be there to see him. I WAS SCARED!!! My grandfather is a diabetic and has been for years, he too is on all kinds of medication. Anyways, they thought that he was going to have a triple bypass, but once they got him in the operating room and started doing the surgery they realized that it was going to be a quadruple bypass. They did the surgery and my Grandfather came through with flying colors. He was only in the hospital a week to 10 days (I can't quite remember). While he was in the hospital though, I phoned him and he was able to get out of bed and come talk to me for a few minutes. The worst part was that he wasn't sure if he was going to be able to fly in an airplane and come to my wedding, I was very worried about it, but he got the ok and was here for my wedding. A very happy ending, he is still very healthy and is doing GREAT!I know that this may not help your fear but it shows you that my grandfather had the same surgery at 73 years old, and he is fine.I hope your fathers surgery goes well, and he has a quick recovery!!Take Care",

            "answer": "yo shanae whassup its kevins mom mother 40 holla yo kevins father can totally relate to what youre talking about his father also has blocked arteries girlfriend and hes had them for about 7 years and he never went for heart surgery all he does is just take heart medicine and it keeps him alive but he is still in bad health but as far as your dad goes i think that it is good that they found the blockages early so they could give him the surgery and hopefully everything works out fine for him if he smokes tell him to quit girlfriend its just bad for his health and its gonna make his heart problem worse 43 seems kind of young to have blockage most men dont develop blockage until they are about 50 or so. but anyways if your dad does everything right then he should be fine. everyone knows that there are risks with certain surgeries especially heart surgery all you could do is hope and pray that everything works out for him. after your father gets the surgery hes gonna have to start eating heathier to prevent future blockages and if he smokes tell him to quit and tell him to start exercising if he already doesnt. at least your dad is gonna get the surgery my dad never went and got it. yo shanae girl no matter what your father needs that surgery the doctors said so if he doesnt get the surgery then his condition is only gonna get worse. he doesnt really have much of a choice. do you know what happens to people who dont go for heart surgery eventually they die kevins father has had a heart problem for 7 years since he was 53 now hes 60 but trust me hes in bad health he takes more medicine than your dad does. anyways see ya girl hope everything works out for your father goodluck with his surgery. peace holla back at ya later.",
