            "answer": "I'm no doctor so this only my opinion. If you upping your medication because of food types you're consuming then you must alter your diet/nutritional intake. Considering your remote living situation I don't know if this is possible. But, if can be done then change your diet/nutrition by removing sugar and bad carbs from your diet. If you don't know what these are Google search for the answers.\u00a0\u00a0Giving them up is a simple lifestyle choice.Living a healthy lifestyle can take you off insulin dependency, that is, unless you have an existing immune system disorder and/or pancreatic issues that only medication and insulin can make up for. So, to answer your question, the answer is yes, it is possible not to have injectable insulin dependency. However, without knowing your medical history or having your medical records to review only your doctor can answer this.",
