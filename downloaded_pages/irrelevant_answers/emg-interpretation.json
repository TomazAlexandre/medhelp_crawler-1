            "answer": "I have myoclonus (myoclonic jerks) which may or may not be due to epilepsy. My legs, arms, stomach, even sometimes my tongue jerks. I've also had an EMG (prior to my diagnosis) and it also came back \"normal\". Which made no sense to me either. I just moved on to other tests. Has your doctor mentioned myoclonus?",

    "question": "Hi,After 2 months of twitching in my legs I had an EMG done on my legs.\u00a0\u00a0Before I did, my doc ran bloodwork for thyroid, diabetes, electrolytes, magnesium, Vitame B6-12 and Vitamin D - all came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0Additional work up was done for Ferritin (normal) and CK (also came back normal.)I did my first EMG done a month ago - came back clean but persisting symptoms made me request a second one.\u00a0\u00a0Today I received the report which stated the following:\u00a0\u00a0\"There is no spontaneous activity, interference pattern full, volitional potentials are normal, except a long volitional on the vastus medialis\".\u00a0\u00a0I googled volitional to bits and pieces but cannot seem to find what this relates to.\u00a0\u00a0Is the same as long duration motor unit potential?\u00a0\u00a0If it is, this could be a potential serious thing?\u00a0\u00a0It was noted in the interpretation that my EMG is \"basically normal\" - although it certainly doesn't feel that way to me.I am a 36 year old female, no smoking, no Rx meds, no medical history of any sorts but I am terrified I am in the early stages of ALS.",
