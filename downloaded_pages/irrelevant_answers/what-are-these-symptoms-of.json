    "question": "I don't want to be posting in the wrong place or anything, but this has been bothering me and I can't see a doctor for awhile because of some family complications, schedules, etc., so if anyone has the time please bear with me for this story.It started yesterday, I was at practice lifting weights, and I felt perfectly fine. Then I got a cramp in my stomache so I sat down, then got dizzy, and my vision blurred and hearing muffled until the point that I couldn't see at all. My coach noticed something was wrong and I asked him to take me home. My vision came back very gradually, kind of like a thick fog slowly fading away, and the dizziness went away gradually, and after some rest so did the cramp. My mom came home and at first was angry, then said I was just dehydrated, which didn't make since because I drink water like crazy. Then she said I wasn't eating enough, and I didn't believe that either. I had started dieting and lost about six pounds in the two months school has been out, but occasionally I'd pig out - in the end, I eat like the average 16-year old. Then she said, \"Does your vision ever get grainy? That's a sign of dehydration. If you see that as a warning, you shouldn't have fainting spells again.\" And I say \"Everybody sees like that, right?\" and she looks at me funny, so I say \"I've been seeing like this for as long as I remember.\" At least ever since I was little. I remember that one day long long ago I noticed that things looked staticy, but never said anything about it. I haven't up until this day, I thought that was how everybody sees things. I have 20-20 vision, and glasses for my stigmatism, so I don't think it's an eye problem.After doing some research, I have a list of symptoms I experience. Again, these are things that I ignore. I'm an athlete on a pretty tough team so I don't complain, and sometimes I just think that maybe everyone goes through these things.-Insatiable thirst-I can drop weight very quickly and hardly change my diet (I was asked to lose weight for the event I was running, and without really trying that hard or paying much attention, I lost it one pound at a time. I don't recall doing anything different except replacing desserts with fruits, and not even that sometimes)-I get random spells of dizziness or blurry vision-The near-fainting spell I had-Very tired and weak sometimes, then extremely energetic randomlyThe reason I'm in the diabetes forum is because my mom said that diabetes runs in my dads side of the family, and if it wasn't dehydration or hypoglycemia, diabetes might be the case. If anyone thinks it may be something else, please tell me.Thank you very much for you time and help",
