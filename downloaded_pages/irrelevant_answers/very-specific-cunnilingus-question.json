            "answer": "Welcome back to the Forum.\u00a0\u00a0Your questions are quite specific. As you might have guessed, the influence of diabetes on STD risk is not specifically studied.\u00a0\u00a0Persons with diabetes are at risk for certain infections such as yeast infections (favored because of increased susceptibility due to high glucose).\u00a0\u00a0In addition, certain infections are harder to cure- or average in diabetics because of the potential for poor blood flow to the site if infection resulting from vascular problems which occur in some persons with diabetes. On the other hand there is no reason that diabetes should make a person more susceptible to gonorrhea or other STDs.\u00a0\u00a0I'll address your specific questions below:1.\u00a0\u00a0No, neither high nor low blood sugar should chance your risk for getting gonorrhea or other STDs.2.\u00a0\u00a0Clindamycin is related to erythromycin and azithromycin. In theory, if anything, if you were taking the clindamycin at the time of exposure it might slightly lower your risk of becoming infected.\u00a0\u00a0The prior infection requiring the root canal should have no influence on your risk for STD infection.3.\u00a0\u00a0No, diabetes should not modify your risk (which is low in the absence of lesions) of getting herpes.I hope this information is helpful to you.EWH",

            "answer": "Dr. Hook,Thank you for your thoughtful answer. I feel quite a bit better. I just want to clarify two things. 1. If I read correctly your response and responses to earlier posts by others on cunnilingus: a. My risk of oral ghonnorea from this exposure was low to begin with; andb. Even if I had been exposed the clindamycin would have further lowered the chance of infection (I had already been taking it for 5 days 150 milligram capsules 4 times a day and have since been taking them and will finish them two to three days after the exposure; a few days I missed one but will finish them on the normal schedule, which is why I write 2-3 days rather than just two). 2. The risks of either type of herpes from this exposure was quite low, but if it occured homw longwould ittake for sores to develop? Thank you again for your thoughtful answer and for all you do on these sites.",

    "question": "Dear Drs.,I posted this by accident to the general community, but because of the specific facts meant to post to you. I have checked the site carefully and already know that the risk of getting an STD from cunnilingus is extremely low even if one has minor gum disease etc.... My question is a bit fact specific. Yesterday I went to an Asian Massage Parlor. I received a handjob, which I know is safe sex, but I also gave her at least ten minutes of oral, mostly focused on her clitoris and mostly licking and sucking on it. I do not think I inserted my tongue. She did say she came and she was dry at the veginning and not after. At any rate two specific factors cause me to post. First, I am a well controlled diabetic and at the time I think my sugar was low, but afterwards I treated it and while it is unusual for me it went quite high for several hours (beginning about two hours after the contact). Would this raise my risk for oral ghonnorea or herpes (based on your answers to other posts I know these are the two remotely possible std's with cunnilungus). Second, about a week before the incident I had a root canal and because of a gum or tissue infection in the area of the tooth I had been on Clindamycin for about five days, would that lower my chances of getting oral ghonorrea or would the prior infection raise them? Finally, there were no visible sores in her vaginal area so I know this lowers the Herpes risk, but does my being diabetic raise it and if I had gotten HSV 1 or genital type on my mouth how long until sores would appear. Long story, but my girlfriend and I got back together this weekend and I know she wants to have sex and oral is quite important to her. I didn't expext the reunion, but we saw each other the day after I was at AMP and after talking for several hours realized we are still in love. Thank you",
