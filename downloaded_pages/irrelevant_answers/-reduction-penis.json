            "answer": "Hi there!Though normally a flaccid penis is expected to have smaller length than a completely erect penis, few factors that could affect the length of the penis/ erection include peyronie's disease, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few. I would suggest considering an evaluation by a primary care physician or a urologist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
