            "answer": "I've had pains like yours. I lost weight and most of them vanished. I have a bit of stiffness in my arms still..mostly in the a.m., but after I get going..and the more I move..they seem to be O.K. I HAD to lose weight..I developed diabetes II and I had no choice. Atleast I didn't think the choice was much to think about. I was 300 and I've lost 90 lbs in a year. I've got 60 more to lose in the next year.I have the neck pain which radiates into my arms on occasion and I have to say that sometimes the pain in my arms..one or both at the same time lasts for afew day. It goes away and maybe visits me 2 months later. I've learned to deal with it, but truly..I think I'll eventually go to a doctor. It's hard when both arms hurt. I'm doing much better though since the weight loss and expect that the more I lose..the less pains and aches I'll have.GOOD LUCK TO YOU!!",
