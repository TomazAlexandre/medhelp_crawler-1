            "answer": "I am the mom of an 18 year old who was diagnosed at the age of 21 months.\u00a0\u00a0I am not a medical professional, so any advice given here should be verified with your daughter's healthcare team.\u00a0\u00a0I am sorry to say that I do not have any first-hand knowledge of the types of insulin you are referring to, and we really cannot give advice about specific doses anyway, but I can share my opinion about her hypos with you.\u00a0\u00a0First of all, have you done any 3am checks?\u00a0\u00a0This is very good information to present to your daughter's endocrinologist and can sometimes give another clue as to why the erratic and higher morning bg's.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter was very active as your daughter is with sports and her activity during the day would always catch up with her in the middle of the night.\u00a0\u00a0I swear, sometimes she drank a juice box and ate some crackers while fast asleep!\u00a0\u00a0If your daughter is bottoming out during the middle of the night, her body could be producing glucose to protect itself and thus creating a high morning bg.\u00a0\u00a0A little less sleep for us parents is well worth obtaining better bg control.\u00a0\u00a0Your daughter may also be ending her honeymoon phase.\u00a0\u00a0That refers to the time period after diagnosis that the pancreas may be producing some insulin and therefore making proper dosing very difficult.\u00a0\u00a0With the little ones, a lot of pediatric endocrinologists would rather have them be running on the higher side than take a chance with having them be running low.\u00a0\u00a0Naturally, you should be in weekly contact with your daughter's healthcare team when you are not satisfied with her bg's.\u00a0\u00a0Any type of consistant pattern of highs and or lows should be discussed with her physician so that dose changes can be made.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that I have helped in some way and I am sure that others will have some more insight for you.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

    "question": "Hi, my 8 year old daughter, diagnosed last September, has recently moved onto Mixtard30 (9units) at breakfast and Novarapid30 (2 - 4 units).\u00a0\u00a0She is small for age - weight & height.\u00a0\u00a0Sugars are very erratic.\u00a0\u00a0Is there any reason why she cannot go onto a \"home mix\" regime.\u00a0\u00a0I.e.I mix her insulin quantities - fast and long acting, appropriate to the meal she wants to eat not what she has to eat for the insulin as well as sorting out her high sugars - particularly in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0She eats evening meal at 6.15pm.\u00a0\u00a0Bed at 8.30pm.\u00a0\u00a0Asleep at 9pmish.\u00a0\u00a0Bedtime sugars often between 11-14mmol.\u00a0\u00a0Midnight sugars 10mmol.\u00a0\u00a0Morning 15 - 17mmol. WHY??!!\u00a0\u00a0She is physically active - dance/sport amlost every day.\u00a0\u00a0Could she be having delayed hypos hence the rise?\u00a0\u00a0Really need some help here.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
