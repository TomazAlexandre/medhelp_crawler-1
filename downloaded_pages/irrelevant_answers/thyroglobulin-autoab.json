            "answer": "The presence THYROGLOBULIN AUTOAB can lead to the destruction of the thyroid gland. However, 83 eventually is not high enough destruction to show up in thyroid blood test, but might in the future.Thyroid antibodies will fluctuate, wax and wan, go up and down. Sometimes hide into remission only to pop-up again in the future andare not specific for confirming a diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid diseaseSuch antibodies are more likely to appear after trauma to, or inflammation of, the thyroid gland and occur in organ-specific autoimmune diseases, including pernicious anemia, Addison's disease, type I diabetes mellitus , polyglandular endocrine failure syndromes etc., Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis,\u00a0\u00a0pernicious anemia are sometimes positive and\u00a0\u00a0well as in the normal population without thyroid disorders.TPO Abs will rise if you've had vaccines or are being exposed to something you're allergic to, such as eating gluten when you have gluten sensitivity.Some patients with Hashimoto's disease may have negative levels of circulating antibodies, and conversely, patients with positive levels of thyroid antibodies may never develop thyroid disease during their lifetime.People do not get treatment for having antithyroid antibodies. There is nothing that can be done to regulate antibody levels. It is possible to have the antibodies and have normal levels of thyroid hormone. People MUST get treated for abnormal levels of thyroid hormone in the body regardless of whether or not they have antithyroid antibodies",
