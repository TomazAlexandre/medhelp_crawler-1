            "answer": "Hello~Have you been tested for diabetes, the burning sensation in your feet sort of gives me a clue that this could be one of the reasons, also the fatigue. Are you thirsty more than normal? I am glad you are seeing a haematologist, hopefully this will give you some insight as to what the problem is.",

            "answer": "Well I saw the hematologist and there was nothing indicitive of a blood related disorder. However symptoms are still persisting. I don't get the redness anymore. But I am getting tingling/vibration like feeling in both of my legs and I have felt it in my right arm, and right lower back. Neurologist last year ordered a brain MRI with no findings.The tingling feeling radiates upwards and then disappears after a few minutes. Anyone know any disorder or diagnosis related to these symptoms, they seem to come and go over the past 2 years.",

    "question": "I am a 23 year old female. I have always been in shape and work out often; however had to slow down, since experincing weird symptoms starting 2 years ago. I've been experincing these issues and no doctors are able to identify the problems.My symptoms consist of redness in my hands and legs and feet. The redness is accompanied by pain and weakness. When I walk I feel burning sensation on the soles of my feet. Random pain in legs and arms almost what looks to be near or on the vein.The symptoms seem to come and go and flare up when exposed to hot weather or stress. I also have a lot of body aches and I'm very fatigue through out the day.I have a upcoming visit to see a hematologist. Any ideas on what this could be?",
