            "answer": "Hello MWood,As you may know, we're all volunteers here & are not medical professionals, so it's best to review your test results -- and any online research -- with your doctor.Your fasting number is well within the normal range.\u00a0\u00a0Your GTT numbers seem to be on the low side, as it is common for normal folks' blood sugars to rise to 140+ during a GTT.\u00a0\u00a0Your blood sugar also dropped rather quickly & to a very low level.\u00a0\u00a0Were you given anything at that 3hr point to help raise your blood sugar?Talk to your endocrinologist about hypoglycemia -- an endocrine condition where the pancreas secretes too much insulin in the presence of sugar.\u00a0\u00a0The result is a drop in blood sugar with symptoms much like you described at \"hour 3.\"\u00a0\u00a0Many things affect blood sugar on a given day, so it is not wise to leap to conclusions based on a single test.Chances are you were advised to take this test for a reason and that reason might include a pattern that will help your doctor pinpoint what's going on with you.\u00a0\u00a0If you get a diagnosis of hypoglycemia, rest assured taht you can live a rich full life and can avoid feeling that \"exhausted, kinda sick\" feeling by learning how to balance your food & exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

            "answer": "Hello and thank you for the reply.\u00a0\u00a0No, I was not given anything after the 3hr mark, but I felt tired and sick.\u00a0\u00a0I had the test done b/c lately I have not felt myself, fatigue, irritable, I wake up everyday with a headache and starving, hungry all the time, I have gained about 7 pounds(I know that is not alot, but to a small person it is esp, when I have maintaned a weight of around 120 for years).\u00a0\u00a0I don't exersice mainly b/c I don't have the energy, I know our bs levels fluctuate all day long, but so much of the time I feel like I am either real anxious or tired after eating.\u00a0\u00a0I know all this weighs on diet, and I really need to be more aware of what and when I am eating. I had tests done to check for anemia and thyroid, tests came back fine.\u00a0\u00a0I kinda wondered if it could have been pre-diabetes, but am so happy they came back fine, but at what point is considered to low?\u00a0\u00a0I am kinda afraid the Dr. is just going to say my test came back fine and not ot worry about anything, should I be concerned or not?",
