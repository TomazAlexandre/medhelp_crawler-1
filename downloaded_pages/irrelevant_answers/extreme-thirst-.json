Which is good because we are suppose to be drinking more water than sodas/juices. I think its just a craving or we are using our energy more that we are pregnant?. Idk but im happy im craving water than sodas.",

    "question": "Lately, I've been drinking down bottles of water like I live in the desert. There's even been times where it's 2 bottles a day. I'm not complaining in the slightest because I know there's nothing more healthy for me & the baby, but does this mean anything? What I think it could be, is dehydration. I just find myself craving the taste of the coldness & just water, period.Anyone else going through this?",
