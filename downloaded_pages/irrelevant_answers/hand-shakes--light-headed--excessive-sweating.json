            "answer": "Hi,We're not doctors, just volunteers who either have diabetes or a child with diabetes, so obviously we can't diagnose anything. But I can tell you the symptoms of diabetes are very consistent: extreme thirst, frequent urination and weight loss. That is not what you are experiencing, I take it. So I highly doubt you are diabetic.Your symptoms are similar to what my daughter experiences when she has a low blood sugar, but those do not happen with undiagnosed diabetics who are not on insulin.I would recommend that you see your doctor or, even better, an endocrinologist. You may have hypoglycemia, which is often pretty mild and not hard to deal with. But again, I'm not a doc!Good luck to you.",

            "answer": "I agree t, it does sound as though you are hypoglycemic - when you feel dizzy or faint, have some juice or regular soda, don't over do it but you need some sugar right away when that happens.",
