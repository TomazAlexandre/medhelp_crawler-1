            "answer": "I am not a physician, but the mom of type one diabetic, and the daughter of a type 2.\u00a0\u00a0 I am sure your physician is going to figure out the cause of your daughter symptoms. I would suggest that if you do not feel your doctor is not doing enough or you have a feeling that you should get a second opinion do so.\u00a0\u00a0There is nothing wrong in getting a second or third opinion.\u00a0\u00a0I would tell you to check with your insurance as to what their policy is s sometimes you need to get an authorization, but all most all insurance companies will pay for second, or third opinions, so do not hesitate to get that second opinion.Remember you need to be an advocate for your child and his/ her health.When I was diagnoses with cancer, I went for a second opinion, and a third, till I felt comfortable\u00a0\u00a0 with the doctor, and the way to handle my condition. I did the same when my daughter was diagnosed to find and endocrinologist that my daughter and my husband and I felt comfortable with, and that had the same philosophy in treating and controlling diabetes as we do.I hope that things work out.\u00a0\u00a0Please stop back and let us know how things are going.",

            "answer": "I'm another volunteer and want to emphasize the good advice that WAK has given.It is not uncommon that hypo-glycemia can preceed diabetes in some people.\u00a0\u00a0Hypo-glycemia is a condition in itself, as well, and when you look for a second opinion, seek out the advice of a pediatric endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0These folks specialize in the endocrine system, and will be very familiar with both hypoglycemia & diabetes.WAK is 100% right in encouraging you to trust your knowledge of your daughter and to be a relentless advocate for her.\u00a0\u00a0Keep track of her behaviors, moods, jsut like you reported here. Bring them to your second-opinion doctor.All of us hope your daughter is not/does not become diabetic, but if you get that diagnosis remember to reach out again to JDRF, as we can put you in contact with folks to help you & your family moreso than can be done in this very public arena.",

    "question": "This is my first time posting and I could really use some advice about what's happening with my little girl. Almost two weeks ago my daughter started becoming quite moody and fussy (especially in the evenings). She was extremely tired in the mornings and begging for sweets all day (which was very unusual). There were some other small weird symptoms too, but I won't go into everything. Last Thursday when I went to wake her up she was lethargic and glassy eyed. All she would say is \"I want my bed,\" and \"I need something sweet.\" I got very concerned and we took her to the doctor, who did a full panel. Her glucose came in at 49 and she had slightly elevated liver enzymes. I grew very concerned because I read that Hypoglycemia in children is most often caused by diabetes. But now the doctor is telling me that it would be impossible for her to be diabetic with those numbers. They are testing her insulin and several other things and all he has said is that it could be caused by a number of rare things. So I guess I am confused. Does any of this make any sense to anyone? I am so concerned about my daughter.",
