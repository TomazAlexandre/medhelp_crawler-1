            "answer": "Hi!Your MRI results are typical of migraine headaches. Small vessel ischemic disease or changes of brain blood vessels are seen in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or Wilson's Disease, migraine headaches, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Though they are of no immediate threat, all these causes, and the presence of ischemic changes can be a risk factor for future stroke. Hence, prevention methods should include a healthy lifestyle, and a combination of diet, exercise, and medicines. Please discuss with your treating doctors. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you Dr. Mathur. My Dr. wants to start me on cholesterol medicines and a daily aspirin regimen. Also she suggests the Medditeranean Diet and exercise. Do you feel this is good advice? I really don't like going on cholesterol meds but if it's the only way to prevent future problems then I will do it. Was wondering if there are any alternatives to lipitor?",

No recent infarct, abnormal parenchymal enhancement, intracranial mass lesion, or mass effect.I had the MRI done because I was experiencing headaches.",
