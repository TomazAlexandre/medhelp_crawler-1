            "answer": "HiThere are many causes for excessive sweating. Refer: http://www.parsec.it/summit/hyper1e.htmHypoglycemia that is low sugar in blood too causes excessive sweating and a feeling of chill. You must monitor your blood sugar, especially since you are on insulin. Next time that you have this episode please see if taking some quick sugars like glucose, glucose biscuit etc gives relief. If you feel better on eating, the symptoms are most likely due to low sugar. This can be dangerous, hence need to see your specialist at the earliest. He will monitor your sugar throughout the day, so if there are spells of low sugar it will be caught.The other reason could be menopause, as your doctor said. However you need to rule out hypoglycemia or low sugar spells.Let me know what your doctors say. If you need more help, please feel free to contact. I\u2019ll be happy to answer your queries. Please keep me posted.",
