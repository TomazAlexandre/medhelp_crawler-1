            "answer": "First, how do you know other vegans have had incredible results?\u00a0\u00a0The vegan diet is an ideological diet based on a belief system that one shouldn't use animals for anything.\u00a0\u00a0It isn't a health diet, though it's often billed as that to sell it.\u00a0\u00a0No natural people, meaning people not living in an artificial civilization, has ever been vegan that I know of.\u00a0\u00a0So what does this mean for you?\u00a0\u00a0It means people generally don't go vegan for health purposes -- they do it in pursuance of a belief system.\u00a0\u00a0Some people are not suited to be vegan or vegetarian, and some are ideally suited for it.\u00a0\u00a0As with most things regarding health, it's a very individual thing.\u00a0\u00a0When they took the Plains Indians and converted them to mostly plant eating (they had been mostly animal eating) they developed a lot of heart disease and diabetes, and still suffer from that.\u00a0\u00a0People aren't the same.\u00a0\u00a0Okay.\u00a0\u00a0Now let's assume you are suited for a vegan diet.\u00a0\u00a0So second, being vegan doesn't change the calculus for healthy eating -- you still have to get your protein, your antioxidants, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Just being vegan won't make you thinner or healthier, you still have to eat the proper balance for you.\u00a0\u00a0You still have to move.\u00a0\u00a0You still have to do all the things everyone else has to do to be healthy.\u00a0\u00a0When I managed health foods stores, vegans ate the worst of all of my customers on movement diets -- they'd eat anything as long as it was vegan.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of the food they ate had not food at all in it, such as frozen \"ice cream\" and cream cheese made almost entirely of hydrogenated vegetable oil.\u00a0\u00a0It wasn't healthy, and it was fattening, but they felt good about it because there wasn't any animal in it.\u00a0\u00a0You still have to avoid eating too much processed food, eating too many simple carbs, etc.\u00a0\u00a0The basic rules don't change.",
