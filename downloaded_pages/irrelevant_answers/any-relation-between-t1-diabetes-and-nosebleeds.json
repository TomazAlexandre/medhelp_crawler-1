            "answer": "I agree with JDRF-VOL-RL that the nosebleeds are more likely to be caused by something other than type 1 diabetes. I had nosebleeds at about the same age, and in my case it was allergy-related. My doctors suggested that I would \"outgrow\" the problem, and this is indeed what happened. It wasn't fun at the time, but it all stopped by the time I was about a junior in high school. No nosebleeds since then. I would ask his doctor about other allergy meds, or perhaps allergy shots. Or maybe also a humidifier to keep some moisture in the air. Do discuss this with his doctor, for there may be a simple solution.By the way, my own son had a few nosebleeds at about the same age, and he has similar allergy problems.",

Anyway, I will get a nosebleed and within 18 to 24 hours my glucose levels will spike for an undeterminable amount of days. Until one day, things will just go back to normal again.I have asked my specialists about this phenomenon and they say they've never heard anything like it before. But I can guarantee that a nosebleed means I'm in for a bad ride.",
