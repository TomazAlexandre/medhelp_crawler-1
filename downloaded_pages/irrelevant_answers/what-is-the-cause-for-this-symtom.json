            "answer": "Nausea, feeling dizzy and shivery?\u00a0\u00a0Controlled Diabetes, but recent weight loss related to gastric bypass?I'm thinking he needs to visit his PCP and a nutritionist to make sure his current diet is satisfying his nutritional needs. What worked before his surgery, is not going to work after his surgery. And as he loses weight his nutritional needs will change.\u00a0\u00a0It's also going to be easier for him to move around and increase his activity level, which will again, change his nutritional needs.Kick his bum and make him go to the doctor! And then let us know how it goes :) Good luck!",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!What your friend has is called Dumping Syndrome or rapid gastric emptying following gastric bypass surgery. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, shivering etc. This is treated by taking small frequent meals, drinking fluids in between meals, taking more of proteins and less of carbohydrates and simple sugars (total no).Shivering is due to low blood sugar or hypoglycemia. Generally this is due to increased secretion of insulin from the pancreas. This can be overcome by increasing fiber in diet which along with reduced insulin secretion delays gastric emptying. Drugs like octreotide, cholestyramine or proton pump inhibitors such as lansprazole help slow down digestion. At times surgery is required where Roux-en Y gastrojejunostomy is done.\u00a0\u00a0Please discuss this with the surgeon who performed the bypass and get this treated. Hope this helps. Take care!",
