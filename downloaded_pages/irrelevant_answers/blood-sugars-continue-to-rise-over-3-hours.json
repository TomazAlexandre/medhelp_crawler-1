            "answer": "Your issue seems to have more to do with hypoglycemia, rather than hyperglycemia.Your blood sugar level never did even rise to a diabetic level.The glucose you drank was pure sugar and it only raised your level to 123.. wow.\u00a0\u00a0The roast beef sandwich and yogurt were mostly protein with the bun being carbs, but not enough to raise your blood sugar very quickly, which is why you got dizzy and felt bad.The orange, on the other hand, is almost pure sugar, so it would increase your blood sugar quickly, which would make you feel better.Have you tested your fasting blood sugar levels?\u00a0\u00a0Those are when you first get up in the morning, before you eat/drink anything.\u00a0\u00a0Normal levels are below 100.Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) often leads to type II diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I had hypoglycemia for years and now have \"pre\" diabetes.",

    "question": "I am a 40 yr old woman who maintains a very physically fit lifestyle with eating well and running regularily for exercise.\u00a0\u00a0In spite of this, my glucose level has risen to 101.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor was not concerned as I was already doing the proper things in my life to keep me from getting diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0During 2 of my 3 pregnancies, I was borderline diabetic but never treated.\u00a0\u00a0That is really my only risk factor.\u00a0\u00a0However, in early November I developed some new symptoms that are debilitating and concerning.\u00a0\u00a0After I eat foods with any amount of carbs or sugars, I get very dizzy and light-headed.\u00a0\u00a0I also get a terrible headache a few hours after a meal.\u00a0\u00a0It gets so bad at times that I wonder if I should drive a car.\u00a0\u00a0If I don't eat things with sugars, I get very shaky, weak, and queasy.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor decided to run a 3 hour glucose intolerance test (100 mg glucose) on me to see if that gives any idea of what is happening.\u00a0\u00a0My test results appear normal, yet confusing to me.My starting glucose was 101, at one hour it was 117, at two hours it was 119, and at 3 hours it was 123.\u00a0\u00a0The procedure left me feeling a little dizzy at first, but it wasn't until I ate food after the appointment that I really struggled.\u00a0\u00a0After eating a roast beef sandwich and a yogurt, I got so dizzy I had to lie down for well over an hour.\u00a0\u00a0Then I got the most insane headache and became very shaky.\u00a0\u00a0At about 5 p.m., I had a snack of a small orange and then I started to feel a little better again.So what I am confused about is...why did my glucose level continue to rise over 3 hours instead of peak and drop down like most people do?\u00a0\u00a0And why would I get more sick after eating than I would having a 100 mg dose of glucose on an empty stomach?\u00a0\u00a0My doctor is out of town for another 2 1/2 weeks and the nurse had really no advice for me other than sometimes your body produces a large amount of insulin after you eat which can cause this feeling.\u00a0\u00a0So why didn't I get this feeling immediately from the test?\u00a0\u00a0This is very concerning to me because each day gets more difficult than the one prior and know that something is definitely not right.\u00a0\u00a0I need some advice because I don't know how bad I will be by the time my doctor finally returns from vacation.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your thoughts.",
