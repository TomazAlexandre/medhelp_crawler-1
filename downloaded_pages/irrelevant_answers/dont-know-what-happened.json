            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Your symptoms do point towards TIA or ministroke. It could also be due to epilepsy like attack. Chances of hypoglycemia are less as you were having an aerated drink. However if there was no food for hours before, then it could be a possibility.Another possibility is severe gastric reflux or GERD (smoking, drinks both alcohol and aerated, spicy oily food, all aggravate it). It could also have been a vaso-vagal attack with lowering of blood pressure. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. I understand you do not have insurance. However try out whatever options are available to you.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Blood pressure cuffs don't cost too much. You might want to monitor your blood pressure for a few months. Pressure of about 120 over 70 is perfect. You need to be on blood pressure lowering pills if you have high blood pressure. There pretty cheep at Wal-Mart. I use them. There are some health fairs at places that will test you for cholestrol for about $10 too.Hope you get a handle on this.",

    "question": "Whats going on with me?? I was sitting in my house and just had a drink of soda, then all of a sudden it felt like I took to big of a drink of soda and I became very light headed and dizzy both my legs started to tingle and my left hand began to shake, my fiance said my eyes were squinting and my cheeks were flush but i wasnt hot. It's wierd because it just came out of nowhere and lasted about 30 seconds, this is the first time anything like this has happened. I don't have insurance other wise I would have gone to the doctor. I do admit I am 23 years old, 6'6 and weigh about 330 I do smoke, occasionally drink and do not do illicit drugs. I just need to know If I had a stroke or if its the beginings of diabetes or hypoglycemia or something worst?",
