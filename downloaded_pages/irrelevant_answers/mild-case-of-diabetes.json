            "answer": "Hi Jeff,Many things can cause shaky hands including some medications.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to mention this to your physician along with any patterns you've detected over time (time of day, activities that make it worse/better, foods that help/interfere).While none of us here is a physician, we know a lot about diabetes from our experiences and readings/conversations with other diabetics and docs.Type 1 diabetes, an auto-immune disease begins most frequently in young people but many adults can develop it, also.\u00a0\u00a0It is not related to weight or diet.\u00a0\u00a0Most Type 1s are slim at diagnosis.Frequent urination, insatiable thirst and hunger, unexplained weight loss, vision changes, etc are all common symptoms of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Shaky hands is sometimes a symptom of low blood sugar that affect diabetics from time to time.\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, shaky hands can occur in folks who have an unrelated condition called hypoglycemia, in folks with a neurological condition, or in folks who are quite stressed physically or emotionally.\u00a0\u00a0As I mentioned above, it can also be a side effect from some medications.Shaky hands can mean many things ... or can mean simply that a person has shaky hands.\u00a0\u00a0I know a fellow who simply has shaky hands -- seems he always has.Please do discuss this with your own physician especially if it's a relatively new development.\u00a0\u00a0It's worth a phone call to his/her office at least for a telephone conversation if it will take some time to get a regular appointment.\u00a0\u00a0You doc can likely ask you some key questions to begin to narrow down the cause.",
