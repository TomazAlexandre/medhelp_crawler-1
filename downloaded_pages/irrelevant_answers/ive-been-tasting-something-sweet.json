            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!If you have GERD, there is a possibility that you are tasting blood. Also in there is Vit C and Vit B deficiency, you could be having bleeding from gums. Ask your doctor regarding this. Also since you are on medications for so many things, you would need a combination of acid reducing agents to treat GERD. Please ask your doctor about adjusting your prescription for GERD accordingly. Also if you have diabetes, then this could be causing a fruity breath which you perceive as taste.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Ok, I just got back from my Dr.'s appointment and he said it was probably my post nasal drip, or my gerd. Although I did ask if it could be from\u00a0\u00a0my pituitary tumor and he said, it can be, but its unlikely.About 5-6 months ago, I saw an endocrinologist and he said my tumor was not producing anything. Could it be now? Now im nervous that it might be my tumor lol.",
