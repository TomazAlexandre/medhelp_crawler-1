            "answer": "With my first, I was 185 and went to 206. Total of 21 lb weight gain.. she was 7lbs 2 oz. At the beginning of this pregnancy I was 223lbs (I was severely depressed bc that was the biggest I have ever been). I have lost 25lbs since being pregnant. I am 33 weeks. My baby is measuring 5lbs already. I think it depends on how big you were as a baby. I was swollen when I was born but before I left the hospital I was in the 6lb range. I also went two weeks over my due date. So I wasnt huge. My daughter was not huge. My husband on the other hand was born 6 weeks early and weighed 6lbs. So he was a bigg baby. We are having a boy this time and he is measuring big. That why I figure it mainly depends how big you and bd were when yall were born.",

            "answer": "I dont think that is true. I know tiny girls that have 8 to 9lb babies. Talk to your dr though. My dr will induce if the baby gets to 8lbs. He doesnt want someone to have to push out a 9 pounder bc he says it makes the mother tired quicker and causes complications. I know bigger females that have had big babies but I also know bigger females that have tiny babies. I know this woman that is over 240 and both of her babies were under 7lbs.",

            "answer": "I've read that genetics from you and your baby's father are what determine the size of your baby at birth (unless you have gestational diabetes then that's different) however your birth weight when you were born would be closer to the birth weight of your child's then your baby's father and every mother i have talked to has shown the baby was closer to her birth weight than the fathers. But I mean what I read could be wrong I like to hope my son will be close to my size than my husbands. But I'm measuring right on track a day behind most of the time.\u00a0\u00a0At my 33 week appointment I was 33 weeks and 1 day and I measured at 33 weeks same happened at my 31 week appointment was 31 weeks and 1 day measured exactly 31 weeks so my midwife tells me anyways :)",

            "answer": "I will say don't forget the average baby is 9lbs! Here's my storyMy first son was iugr (inter uterine growth restriction) basically he was measuring below average, which meant I had to have steroid injections to strengthen his heart, weekly traces and bi weekly scans because they said he's small and they may have needed to pull him out early as my placenta was small so wasn't providing enough, they knew he was going to be 6lb odd, from my last scan, he was born 6lb 9 oz, ok it may not sound small, I know alot of babies are born 3-4lbs, but most babies now are 8-9lbs, now with this one I'm being monitored again just incase! Guess my point is, u may think u want them to be small, but all because you don't want it to hurt too much, it always hurts!",
