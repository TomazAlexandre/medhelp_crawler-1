I have symptoms that come and go, some days I feel great.\u00a0\u00a0Autoimmune is a puzzling thing.\u00a0\u00a0I hope everything went well with your procedure.",

            "answer": "I don't believe that an endometrial ablation would contribute in any way to an auto immune reaction in your body.\u00a0\u00a0It simply destroys the majority of the uterine lining so that it does not build up and shed as a period.",

I now have hoshimotos disease,\u00a0\u00a0and possibly another autoimmune disease (I suspect lupus but still testing). I was severely sick with what my neuro thinks was autoimmune encephalopathy since at least January 2014. Heavy periods suck, but not as much as autoimmune encephalopathy.\u00a0\u00a0My brain does not function like it used to. Its painful. Caused me to lose over a year of my life and still not well.",

    "question": "I am due to have an endometrial ablation.\u00a0\u00a0I was wondering if the surgery and the destroying of the endometrial lining can cause an autoimmune reaction-since a part of my body would be destroyed and it's composition changed.\u00a0\u00a0I've been monitored over the past 5+ years for the possibility of lupus.\u00a0\u00a0I also have insulin dep diabetes and hypothyroid.\u00a0\u00a0I just don't want to aggravate my autoimmune situation.\u00a0\u00a0I am looking at getting the ablation done due to heavy bleeding and clotting, which only lasts for one day of my period.\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate any input on whether I should have this procedure done.\u00a0\u00a0I just don't want there to be issues down the road, and then I can't do anything about it.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!",
