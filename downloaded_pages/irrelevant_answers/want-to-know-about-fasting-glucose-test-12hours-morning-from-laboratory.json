            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.The level of 130 would be considered elevated. However, as the answer above explains, the fasting blood glucose is not the best test for diagnosing diabetes. I would recommend that you speak with your doctor about what they would recommend as the next step for more reliable testing to see where you stand.Cathy",
