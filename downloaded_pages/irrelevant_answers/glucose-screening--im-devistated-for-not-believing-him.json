In 3 hrs started going up..which meant his body is pulling sugar from other areas of his body.\u00a0\u00a0hypoglycemic is the Dr. answer so he just takes extra things to eat after each class.I hoping this doesnt lead into something elseThanks again",

For months he calls from school saying he is sick and doses off and on in school...He hates school so I just figured he wanted to get out of class.\u00a0\u00a0So I would tell the school nurse to get him a coke and go on with the day.This past Friday he called I went to school and found him in the bathroom on the floor..confused..white as a ghost and very cold..yet sweating..and throwing up from nausea.After I got him home..and a coke later..he fell asleep unitl that night...waking up famished, he ate soup and crackersand felt much better but still nauseatedLittle did I know the doctor report from May had read his glucose was 71 for nonfasting.\u00a0\u00a0And his triglycerides were 196 which were a little high.I feel horrible!!!!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today the Dr. did lots of blood work and set us up with the glucose screening...I need some input on screening. Can it vary thru different days?\u00a0\u00a0Can glucose be different from hour to hour?",
