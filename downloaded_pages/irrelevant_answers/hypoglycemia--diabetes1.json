            "answer": "Hi,I am not sure if your glucose is completely responsible for all of your symptoms, so this may not be an answer to your overall question. But in general, those morning blood sugars are just fine. Your do not(and actually should not) drink orange juice to raise your blood sugars if they are in the 70's. If you do not have diabetes, your body will always bring you back down to normal range no matter what you eat trying to raise the levels. You actually have a very brisk insulin response, so when you drink that orange juice your body is likely overshooting and bringing your blood sugars down a bit fast, thus making you feel unwell.The best way to try to handle these feeling of \"low blood sugar\" is actually to try eating several small mixed meals each day. You feel best after that large meal because it is a mixed meal(with proteins, fast and carbohydates). So try to have 3 main meals and 2-3 snacks during the day, all with some protein, fat and carbohydrates in it. Try to avoid simple sugars, sodas, candiesand simple carbohydrates etc which can all stimulate brisk insulin activity and cause you to feel the effects of the insulin working on your blood sugars.In regard to the headaches, they may be related to the blood sugar changes but maybe not. I think your best bet would be to consult with a neurologist to get their opinion.Hope this helps,take care.",

    "question": "Hi, lately I had been feeling like my blood sugar was dropping alot.\u00a0\u00a0So, I bought a monitor and have been checking most mornings before eating and it's always been below 100, usually well below.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But for example today I checked on awakening it was 74, and I drank a glass of orange juice,\u00a0\u00a0then 2 hours after the juice I feel like it is low so I check and it's 52 and I'm a bit light headed.\u00a0\u00a0 This happens to me all the time.\u00a0\u00a0 But, once I eat a big meal (lunch), for the rest of the day I seem to feel mostly normal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have been screened for diabetes as well as CBC and metabolic and liver panels, and Thyroid testing and MRI brain scan for headaches all about 6 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0 Can you perhaps explain what's wrong w/ me?",
