            "answer": "It actually felt amazing to lay on my back at the ultrasound lol I don't usually sleep on my back but now being pregnant I miss it so badly! Haha I will try keeping an eye on them and see what they do. I'm just extra full of anxiety since the GD thing cuz I didn't go thru this the first time around",

    "question": "I'm now 35+3 with baby girl number 2 and went for my final ultrasound today to check size and everything mainly because I have gestational diabetes right now too. Everything basically went ok I'm sure if the tech was worried she would have mentioned it. But ever since leaving the ultrasound I've got this come and go achy feeling all around my lower abdomen and into my lower back. Baby is moving a whole ton and it makes it hurt a bit more sometimes. It's different than my Braxton hicks contractions but I don't feel like its contractions unless its back labor or something. Do you guys think I should be worried or just try to sleep it off?",
