            "answer": "I am not really sure if this will help much but my grandmother was 58 yrs old when this started happening to her, and she had diabetes as well.\u00a0\u00a0She thought maybe that had something to do with it.\u00a0\u00a0She went to the doctor several times over it and they told her that it was bc of her weight. After several failed attempts she went to another doctor and they told her she had gout and bone spurs which caused severe pain and swollen ankle and foot.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor told her to watch the foods she ate bc it triggered the swelling and pain.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "You need to get to a clinic.These clinics are in every city in the United States and charge based on ability to pay, after an interview. Many charge a baseline of ten dollars a visit once you get registered.I do not accept the complaints about people \"not having the ability to pay\".You may have to wait a while, but these clinics are everywhere.Call your local social services office (there is one in every hospital) for a referral.",
