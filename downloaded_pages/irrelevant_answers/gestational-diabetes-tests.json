            "answer": "(((hug))) I hope your second test turns out okay.I have a few suggestions for your diet...include very few simple carbs and lots of compex carbs...the complex carbs take longer to digest and are released more slowly into your system, giving your body more time to regulate your glucose levels.As for exercise, have you tried exercising in the water? Does movement while sitting hurt also? I know years ago Richard Simmons had his Sweating to the Oldies videos (yeah, I'm old LOL) and he had modifications for his program for people who were chair bound...I'm sure you could find something similar online.I hope all goes well for you!",

            "answer": "Thanks Christine for (((hugs))) and kind suggestions. :)I am a swimmer and used to swim 2-3 times a week even before pregnant. But early in the second trimester this time while I was swimming, I felt pain in the groin area. Since then, I cannot even swim...sigh...As far as diet goes, I will follow your suggestions. My husband is diabetic (Type II) and so, I should follow his diet regiment from now on, I guess...No more oily Chinese take-outs or late night pizzas :).I will check out Richard Simmons videos. You're not old...:) Thanks again. Hope all is well with your pregnancy as well.",

            "answer": "HI, I have been diagnosed with GD, but I am in Australia where they must measure blood glucose differently, when I had the GTT mine came out as 8.4. I have been testing my blood 4 times a day. I have been told to lay off the carbs, its difficult as I love white bread!. How far along are you? I am 17w so I have a long long way to go.I also have SPD, I have it early with this pregnancy, they say to exercises (walk) but ouch it hurts!Do you have High Blood pressure too? As GD usually goes along with HB.All the best :-)",

            "answer": "Thanks for sharing. I am 28 week and no signs of high BP yet.I'm trying not to worry but you know how human mind goes...the moment you hear that you are at high risk, you self-diagnose for sure that you have that illness :).It will be hard for me to cut down carb as well since my diet is full of carb, especially during this pregnancy. I told everyone that I was going to pamper myself with carb, fat, sugar because this is my last chance to eat all I want to eat without worrying about gaining weight!:) Well now, I need to cut down all these I guess...Thanks again and all the best to you too!",

    "question": "I took the glucose screening test on last Friday (6/10) and got a call from my OB's office that my number is 168 and so, the doctor wants me to undertake a glucose tolerance test as soon as possible. They said that the number above 140 is considered high and so, recommend the second test.My number for the first test with my first daughter was high also but when I went for a second test, I was considered fine. I remember at the time, in between the two tests, I exercised like crazy and reduced the intake of carb etc. just like a regular diabetic patient. I don't know if that helped or was not having GD anyways but I was fine after the second test.My question is should I be worried from today till the second test, which is scheduled on 6/27 and change my diet and lifestyle just like before? Also, should I try to schedule the second test earlier than 6/27 if I can so that I can find out the result faster? It says on the web that about 15% of those who have high numbers on the first test turn out to have GD on second test.Another complication for me this time is that I cannot exercise as much as when I did with my first one because this time, I have Symphysis Pubis Dysfunction (SPD) and am much in pain on my groin area when I move much.Anyway, I appreciate any comments/advice/suggestions or sharing your experience...Thanks!",
