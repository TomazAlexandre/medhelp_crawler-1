            "answer": "Hi Quix,I am 34 years of age and have been experiencing these problems since about 2001. It all started with a burning sensation in both legs that lasted a few days. After that time I had been having tingling off and on along with a pain in my right eye(this eye had always been week ever since I was a kid) and several headaches. Not what I would call migranes, sometimes they would throb and others just nag and hang around all day. Sometimes my muscles feel as though they had just gone through a hard workout, that makes me feel worse than the tingling. If you can offer and additional info as to what this could be (good or bad), I would be greatful.Thanks Again",

    "question": "Hi there, I have just received results of my MRI saying I have several white matter lesions of increased T2 signal intensity mostly in the left hemisphere in a subcortical location, and do not have the typical distribution of a demyelinating process. The corpus callosum demonstrates a normal appearance and the posterior fossa and brain stem are unremarkable. These findings are nonspecific and can be correlated clinically. I have also had an EMG and Evoked Potentials which were negative.I have been experiencing tingling mostly on the left side, also on the right foot and leg but not so much. I have also experienced some muscle soreness. Could you please help me understand what this means to me? Is it something that progresses, is there anything I can do to help myself. I will be seeing a neurologist in the near future for a follow-up. Thank you for you help.",
