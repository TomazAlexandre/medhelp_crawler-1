            "answer": "I'm very sorry to hear of your mother's situation and hope her doctors figure out what is going on with her and that she is able to recovery fully. And that is who you should be talking to: her doctors. Your mother's situation sounds like it involves more than just diabetes (you say she had a spinal injury and a head injury). Please talk to your mother's doctors and ask them to explain fully what happened with your mother and to advise you as to if there is anything she and you should be doing differently to care for her.The only suggestions I can make is to test on a regular basis. If she is feeling strange before bedtime it is important to test her blood sugar. Frequent testing prevents many extreme highs or lows. In general\u00a0\u00a0If someone is unconscious it is more likely from a low than a high and administering insulin is the worst thing to do. Ask your doctor if it would be appropriate for you to have glucogon if your mother experiences extreme lows. If you can not arouse someone you should call an ambulance right away.Again, nobody on a website can tell you what your mother's situation is. Talk to her doctors and make sure they explain things well. (or ask to see a specialist).",
