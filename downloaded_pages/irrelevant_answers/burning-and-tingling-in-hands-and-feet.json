            "answer": "The multiple negative HIV tests would make HIV very unlikely.Infection needs to be ruled out.\u00a0\u00a0Urine tests and a urethral swab can look for gonorrhea and chlamydia.\u00a0\u00a0The prostate should be palpated to rule out infection, which can present with the scrotal symptoms.You can consider a transrectal ultrasound to image the prostate for infection, as well as a prostatic massage to milk out and analyze any prostatic fluid.Regarding the tingling, I agree with the MRI and EMG.\u00a0\u00a0Negative testing would make neurological diseases less likely.\u00a0\u00a0The blood tests are negative as well.With the continued non-revealing testing, many of the major diseases have been ruled out.\u00a0\u00a0Obtaining a second neurological and urologic opinion can be considered, preferably at a major academic medical center.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

            "answer": "I have had Peripheral Neuropathy for 3 years. Symptoms are similar to what you are describing. My feet feel like they are burning, numbness. My fingers and toes are numb.Not necessarily connected is that my left testicle started getting swollen. Eventually, They performed surgery to reduce the swelling. They drained 700 ml of fluid.My Neurologist believes the Neuropathy is from Pancreatitis not Diabetes.I was dx with HepC in 1991, Cirrhosis in 1999.Gabapenton 400mg twice or more p/day relieves the pain for me.Ask your Doctor.",

    "question": "Hi Doctor,I write because I am confused (and scared) about my symptoms.In the first week of January I had sex with a girl and started to get a lot of strange symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0My scrotum would tingle when I sat down, I was sick, and I got a rash.\u00a0\u00a0I was stricken with fear of HIV, but I have gotten a 6 week, 9 week, and 3 month test and all were negative.\u00a0\u00a0I would assume this is enough to feel confident on. (Right?) However, certain symptoms persist...at least the scrotal ones do.In addition to the scrotum, my feet felt weird.\u00a0\u00a0For a while it was just a tingle in my foot or hands at times and then, about a month ago, my feet started to feel like they were on fire.\u00a0\u00a0They continue to feel that way to this day.\u00a0\u00a0I also still get a tingling in my scrotum when I sit.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I feel like the feet are worse with alcohol comsumption, but that could also because I'm paying more attention to them afterwards.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't drank for 2 weeks and it doesn't seem to be helping.\u00a0\u00a0I",
