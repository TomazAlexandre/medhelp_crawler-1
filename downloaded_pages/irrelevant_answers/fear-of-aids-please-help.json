    "question": "Ok, I'm 24 years old, and I started obsessing over all kinds of serious illnesses since I was about 17-18 years old. Diabetes, any kind of cancer you can think of, kidney failure, etc. I'm still technically a virgin. I've only dated 2 girls and I've only preformed oral sex and somewhat went inside of her, bt there was no penetration. This was almost 5 years ago. and he other girl I never did anything like that with her. I bit her on her shoulder once and she bled a little. This was over 2 years ago. As far as I know both girls were virgins, and were not infected with HIV. I'm now scared that I have HIV/AIDS. I have this weird white patch on my tongue, a cough, my neck(under my jaw) hurts, and I'm convinced I either have AIDS or oral cancer. It's all I think about. I keep telling myself there's no way I could have either of them. I don't smoke, chew tobacco, and I never technically had sex. I can't stop thinking about. O tell myself that my mind is creating the pain my neck, but that doesn't explain the white patches/bumps on my tongue. And I had an ulcer in the back of my mouth a week ago. Please, someone tell me I'm crazy. I just want to stop thinking about all of this!!!!!",
