    "question": "Hello Doctor,I've got a sharp pain when I first wake up in the morning and put my feet on the ground. This happens for the first couple of steps (sayu 20 steps).This sometimes happens when I get out of the lavatory or have sat on a chair for too long. I tend to move, so I don't think its just the \"pins and needles\" symptom of blood circulation.FYI, I'm a Male Asian, 36 years old. My weight is 99kg and my height 1.74m. I've got no known medical problems, but my paternal grandfather has diabetes and a heart condition, my dad has had 2 stents done.",
