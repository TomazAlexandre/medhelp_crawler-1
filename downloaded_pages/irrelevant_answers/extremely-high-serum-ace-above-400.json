            "answer": "The disease most commonly associated with ACE is sarcoidosis.\u00a0\u00a0However, it is no longer considered to be a means to monitor disease activity and/or response to therapy.Less well known is that ACE can be significantly elevated in a number of other conditions including multiple sclerosis, Addison\u2019s disease, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, alcoholic hepatitis, peptic ulcer, and the nephritic syndrome and, perhaps, with chronic fatigue syndrome.Other pulmonary disorders with significantly increased ACE include emphysema, asthma and lung cancer.The possibility of adrenal insufficiency is intriguing.\u00a0\u00a0The presentation of this is a long history of malaise, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, joint and back pain and darkening of the skin.I suggest that you discuss the possibility of your having one of the diagnoses listed above as less well known conditions associated with significantly elevated ACE.Good luck.",
