            "answer": "Well you have checked all the very important tests that really have ruled out your biggest fear, diabetes, so smelling what appears to be acetone may not really be ketones, he may have strep, tooth infection, gastric reflux, sinus infection etc.If he is growing well this is a good sign, if your doc wants to complete the workup by dipping urine for ketones this will also reassure folks.
