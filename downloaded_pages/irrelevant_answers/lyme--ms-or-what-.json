            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!I am sorry to see you suffering so much and equally sorry to say that the symptoms have a very varied presentation. In the present scenario let your diabetes specialist rule out peripheral neuropathies due to diabetes. Also you should test for MS, Lyme\u2019s, BIH or benign intracranial hypertension, compression of nerves high up in cervical spine, Vit D deficiency, Vit B12 deficiency, electrolyte imbalance and hypothyroidism of autoimmune origin like Hashimotos.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
