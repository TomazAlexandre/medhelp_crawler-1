So if your doctor is going to put you back on Ad's and it happens to be Paxil, you may want to ask him about this.",

            "answer": "Unless you have hepatitis c, I think you're in the wrong forum and might want to go back to the MedHelp Menu and find an AD or Weight Loss Forum. That said, stick around if you like because some of us are on ADs, and others have similar weight problems, possibly from metabolic changes due to the drugs we treat with for Hep C. So....if you hear of anything that might help, do let us know.-- Jim",

            "answer": "Metformin is a drug for the treatment of diabetes in its early stages.\u00a0\u00a0One of its side effects can be weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0I have no idea whether it's safe or even effective for non-diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, since you are overweight, you are at risk for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It never hurts to ask your doctor for an A1C test, which gives you your average glucose reading for the last three months.Fasting blood sugar tests are inadequate for the diagnosis of diabetes, whatever your doctor says.\u00a0\u00a0The A1C is the gold standard, and probably everybody over 50 or overweight should have one annually.\u00a0\u00a0If you get a reading of 6.5 or higher, you will require treatment, and metformin is an excellent medication, often prescribed in conjunction with other drugs including insulin for some people.",

    "question": "I find websites all over talking about here is the information to loose the weight from taking anti-depressents. THen you read the whole thing and it really hasn't told you anything but yes you are fat from taking this drug, yes you can't loose it the same way a normal overweight person would who didn't gain it from a medication and that they are studying studying studying, but no real help. I have heard of Metiform(not sure the spelling) that it was the breaking new \"cure\" for this then they stopped using it so much now and that it really doesn't do much for you but you can try becuae you might loose a lb here or there on it. Does any body have any info aon any of this? My doc wants me back on meds and I really should be but I have dedicated ALLOT of my life to getting back into shape and now I might have to give it all up for a dang medication again.",
