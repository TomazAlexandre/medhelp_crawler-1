    "question": "For about a year I've had tingling in my feet, more in left foot than right. I also have some tingling in my back in the left, mid back, also sometimes in my left inner thigh and on occasion in upper chest. But, mostly it's my feet tingling on and off thoughout thday and night, especially left. I've had both\u00a0\u00a0brain and\u00a0\u00a0spine MRIs that were normal, MD said no disc problems, no pinched nerves! I do NOT have weakness or numbness, etc. (I've had carpal tunnel in the past due to thyorid, that's ok now). Any idea what might cause this tingling? I've wondered of sitting at computer all day or sleeping in the wrong position might do this??? I'm 40 and normal weight.",
