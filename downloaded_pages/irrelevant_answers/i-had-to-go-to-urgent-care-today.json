            "answer": "yeah, my feet aren't bothering me nearly as much now but i have been keeping them propped up every chance i get. i haven't had any morning sickness yet but i do feel quite nauseated. i'm a week further along then i originally thought, according to the doc at urgent care. i'm trying to decide what to do, maybe you all can weigh in on the pros and cons of it. right now i have an appointment to see my OB that i had when i went thru my first miscarriage. she is very good at what she does. probably one of the best in our area. the only drawback is her office is extremely busy and i'm worried i may not get the care i desire. plus my first appointment isn't until june 30th. on the other hand, 2 of my friends have highly recommened this midwife. they said she was awesome. she gives you her cell number in case you need to call her for ANYTHING! her office can get me in, in like 2 weeks. the only drawback here is that if i need an emergency c-section, she cannot perform those and i'll have whoever is on call that night at the hospital. suggestions?",

            "answer": "Honestly, if your regular OB is out of town you will still be stuck with whoever is on call. Most OB offices share who has the off-hours shift so you may not get the one you want anyway. If you want the mid-wife go for it.",

    "question": "i had to go to urgent care today b/c i couldn't get in to see my regular doctor. i've been having some problems with my feet. they have begun turning extremely red and every now and then they start to tingle as though my foot is asleep but it's not. so i decided to go ahead and see the doctor about this just in case i was developing gestational diabetes or something that needed to be controlled. well, the doctor determined i have edema in my feet already!! also, i'm 7 weeks preggers. i was off by a whole week! as far as my feet go, i'm allowed to continue working and all but if my feet began to swell and i have problems getting around i will have to stay off my feet or limit how much i am on them. he also got me set up with my OB/GYN and my first appointment is June 30th. i know that's a long ways away but if i start to have anymore problems i know i can just call and they will get me in sooner. i'm going to have my friend that works in our hospital lab check my beta again thursday night to ensure all is well. hope everyone else is doing well. anyone else have any news?",
