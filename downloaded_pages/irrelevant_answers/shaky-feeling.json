            "answer": "I get the same feeling sometimes. I have type 2 diabetes & have not been able to keep it under control. I have found that if you eat, for example, a candy bar, to help that feeling go away... it will cause your sugar to go up quick, but then it will also drop quick. I have checked my sugar when feeling that way & it be in the upper 80's. I don't know what the \"normal\" would be for someone to feel that way.. but it is in that range for me.The best thing to do when you feel like that is to check your sugar, if it is starting to drop too low, drink a glass of milk. (my doc suggested that). I agree with Jocasta on your fasting levels. Mine are over 200 after fasting most of the time.... definitely too high!",

            "answer": "Hey.\u00a0\u00a0If you have not been diagnosed as diabetic, why is your doc doing A1C and fasting glucose?Eh, regardless, sounds like you are having hypoglycemic episodes (low blood sugar) and the best way to prevent that is to stick to an eating schedule (preferably small meals every few hours) and keep some hard candy or an energy bar with you at all times just in case.As for glucose meters, ask your doc if they have one they could give you (sometimes pharmacy reps give them meters for patients); or get one of the least expensive ones you can find because it doesn't sound like you need a fancy meter, and no matter what model you get, it will be the testing strips that are expensive!",
