Furthermore, your question is unanswerable even if we were the smartest group of EP's on the planet.You've set out a 5000 piece puzzle. Put togehter the edge peices, hidden the box and asked us, \"What is this a picture of?\"Only a detailed conversation with your doctor can answer this. If your Doc doesn't make you comfortable... get another.",

Because your ECG looked normal doesn't mean you don't have a problem.\u00a0\u00a0Did you get a copy of it?\u00a0\u00a0And anything else pertinent?\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes new meds can cause these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0You need to keep checking your HR and BP. Being on the correct med combination should help....unfortunately, sometimes it is trial and error.\u00a0\u00a0Keep in touch with your Dr. on this and keep us updated on how things go.\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck!",

            "answer": "Sounds like your doctors should look towards non-cardiac causes for your rapid heart rhythm?Did they measure thyroids? Dehydration? Stress? Anxiety?If you ask for a 24 hour EKG test, the doctor will see if your heart rate drops during the night. If it does, maybe you are just constantly stressed? A heart rate of 130 while taking 160 mg of propranolol is fairly high, but with normal echo, normal blood pressure (not low), and normal sinus rhythm/tachycardia, cardiac causes for your rapid heart rate is more or less ruled out, and maybe you should visit a GP or internist for further testing?",

It has varied form 135/85 down to 110/65.\u00a0\u00a0While my blood pressure has decreased, my pulse rate is still high.\u00a0\u00a0While at work today, I felt my pulse rate increase, and it stayed around 130 for most of the afternoon, while my blood pressure stayed around 130/80.\u00a0\u00a0I had no chest pain or anything like that, but did feel sweaty during this time.\u00a0\u00a0Now that I am at home, my blood pressure was down to 118/68 and pulse was down to 85.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any ideas what can be causing this and what I can do to prevent it?Thanks",
