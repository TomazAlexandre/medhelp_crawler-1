            "answer": "I know there are several reasons to take Metformin.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't know it could start your period.\u00a0\u00a0I am on it because in the testing with the RE we found that I am insulin resistant and is probably the cause of my m/c's.\u00a0\u00a0So, I started it and am now working on 20 weeks pregnant with a baby boy.\u00a0\u00a0In my case, RE wanted me to take it the first trimester to help sustain the pregnancy, but when I was released my OB said to stay on it the entire pregnancy to help reduce gestational diabetes too.\u00a0\u00a0When I started mine, it was a gradual thing.\u00a0\u00a0I took 500mg for a week, then 1000mg a week and then 1500mg there on out.\u00a0\u00a0Diarrhea was a common side effect.\u00a0\u00a0So, be sure to eat with it.\u00a0\u00a0I've been on it for 8 months now and it doesn't bother me at all.\u00a0\u00a0It's like I'm not taking anything, because my body has gotten used to it.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

            "answer": "Metformin is a diabetic drug and is also given to women with PCOS. If you haven't been diagnosed with PCOS or diabetes you shouldn't take it.Side effects- nausea and diarrhea are the big ones. Upset stomach, headaches are another. It will probably just make you feel like total crud. I take mine before bed. You doctor should start you out small (500mg) and slowly build you up to whatever works for you. I'm currently on 2000mg. It can make me feel really bad so that's why I take it before bed.Metformin isn't a fertility drug. It will not get you pregnant any quicker than anything else. BUT it doesn't help prevent miscarriage somehow though science isn't sure how yet. I just had a miscarriage while on Metformin, sadly, so I guess I wasn't on the good side of the statistic.",
