    "question": "I've never dealt well with the cold, but Monday I decided to walk to my boyfriend's house after class anyway. He lives about 25 minutes away from the school. Anyway, we get into the house and I can't feel my face. It's normal with the cold weather, so I ignored it. I got into his room, put my bag down, too off my coat, and loosened my corset (steel boned). From there on I had to sit on the bed. All of a sudden I got really dizzy and my head felt like it was going to pop, my balance was all off as I couldn't even sit up on the bed, and my eyes wouldn't focus properly. Hell, I was luck if they'd even stay open for more than 3 seconds. Ontop of that, the back of my thighs kept going from frozen, almost ice cold (it felt like to me), to normal warm and back again.My boyfriend asked if I was okay, but the words wouldn't come out. I think I got one syllable out and then nothing. I had to shake my head slowly that I wasn't. My motor skills where shot, so I somehow asked him to lean me back back in the bed with pillows propped up behind me and passed out for two hours. When I woke up I felt better though.I'm pretty sure it was a stroke, but I'm only 18 years old. What do you think? Should I go see the doctor and get some scans done? I have no idea how all this works and I see no point in rushing to the hospital 3 days after it happened.",
