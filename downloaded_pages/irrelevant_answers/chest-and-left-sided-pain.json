            "answer": "It is reassuring that you have had this pain for so long without untoward side effects, and also that you have had a negative stress test. It is certainly not typical that you have these episodes of weakness following the episodes of chest pain. You may have a primary muscle problem, causing the pain and weakness. These are usually rare conditions if genetic but may be caused by medications including statins and diabetes medications. If you are on any of these seek urgent advise from your doctor. If not, you may need to be referred for an EMG and muscle biopsy because there may be something wrong with the muscles or nerves on that part of your body. Strokes can cause single sided weakness, but are usually not associatd with cramps , or the feeling of exhausted muscular activity, so I think it is unlikely that this is a stroke, but a head ct could be used to rule out any CVAs.",
