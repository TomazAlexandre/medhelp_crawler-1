            "answer": "Losing your mother can be such a profound loss; my heart goes out to you.I'm not a doctor, but from what I understand, heart failure isn't hereditary, per sae. But there is a hereditary component to some of the conditions that can lead to heart failure (certain heart valve problems, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, diabetes).To reduce your risks, it would be a good idea to get screened for the above conditions and if you have any of them, follow lifestyle recommendations as closely as you reasonably can.Are you on a regular program of physical activity (like 5 to 6 days a week)? If not, I would start a walking program if your doctor okays it. That and eating fruits and vegetables, whole grains, not too many fried foods, and controlling stress (easier said than done, I know) are also great ways to reduce your risks. Good luck!",

            "answer": "Hi,I can understand your pain & suffering. There are definitely some risks involved in inheriting the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes; however, other factors like diet & exercise also play a major role in the same. Hence, will suggest you to be more cautious about your diet and ensure you have a regular exercise as you have control on them but no control on the genes you have inherited. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
