            "answer": "Coming from a lab tech who hands them out...it's best not to change your diet before the test, the change can affect the results in the end and the taste...well depends on which type and amount you get because they range from a really sugary drink to syrup like, that is what I've been told. Hope this helps!",

The day before try and not eat so much and definitely not sweets because it can cause you to have higher sugar levels on the 1 hour test and have to take the 3 hour test and that one is noooo fun!",
