            "answer": "Your daughter sounds a lot like my son however he has become extremely aggressive at times even threatening my life and his own.It sounds very much like he did initially and like she is trying to gain control over the situation. I would suggest that when you go through the motions with her (perhaps you have already tried this but in case you havent), ie. when she is asked to do something and she refuses give her a formal warning that you need her to do the required act, explain why and explain if you have to ask her again she will be punished, i.e. time out, confiscation of toy or activity etc.\u00a0\u00a0Reiterate that she will still be required to carry out the chore etc. after her punishment.\u00a0\u00a0If she does not pull in her horns and calm down then make sure you follow through on your threat.\u00a0\u00a0(Be careful what you threaten make sure you are in a position to carry it through and that it is realistic and fair!).\u00a0\u00a0Do not allow her back out of her room or time out until the allocated time has passed and she has calmed down completely and is in a position to follow through on her promises.\u00a0\u00a0If she does not do so repeat the action and the punishment. Very exhausting I know but I think that if you stick with it and let them know you are NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN then they will.\u00a0\u00a0I would be interested to know how you get on and hope this helps somehow.\u00a0\u00a0It really does seem like she is just testing the waters and trying to gain control of the situation and her life.\u00a0\u00a0Are there any areas where you feel she might be feeling out of control etc., e.g. are there any problems with social skills, friends, family or home life that may be making her feel like things are happening around her that she has no control over and therefore she is trying to gain control elsewhere.\u00a0\u00a0Also I find that 9 times out of 10 they need you to follow through with discipline strictly and firmly in order to make them feel safe and secure.I hope this if of some use to you.Mumsworld",

            "answer": "How difficult. I'm sorry that things are so hard right now.I agree with the above post. Also, Have you talked to your pediatrician? Could it be possible that something medical is going on?My son is a type 1 Diabetic. He is 9 and still throws some amazing tantrums. He also did when he was younger, before he was diagnosed at the age of 7.I'm not saying your daughter has diabetes, but if you have tried several different things to change the situation with no progress, your child's doctor may be able to give you some direction too.My son became ill and through a very rapid series of events, we ended up with our diabetes diagnosis. We've found that his erratic blood sugars contribute heavily to mood swings and tantrums and the like. Also, he is dealing with chronic illness and that's a tough one for him to grapple with. Us too.I'm also reading a book called \"Boundaries with kids\" by Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend which is very insightful and may give you some info to help. It is helping me.Hope this helped and God bless you. Being a mom is a tough job. We all need encouragement.",

            "answer": "It sounds like your daughter is simply testing her boundaries with you. She is playing a game with you, and guess what.........sounds like she's winning! I am also a parent, and a teacher. The situation you described sounds very frustrating, however, remind yourself of this: You set the example. Ask yourself these questions: 1. Have I established family rules in my home? 2. Is my child aware and in complete understanding of these family rules? 3. Does my child understand the consequences for breaking a rule? and the last one (and most important) 4. Do I ALWAYS follow through with discipline for breaking a rule? The fact that your child screams in her room and then changes her mind and is let out of her room only to display the same behavior indicates that she has no concept of family rules. My advice: Tell your child what you want her to do and give her the choice of doing it or not. Let her know what the consequences will be if she does not do it and also what the reward will be for completing the task. Be strong, lots of kids scream to get their way, let her know that there is a better way of getting her needs met without all the screaming.",

            "answer": "I love this! This is classic!\u00a0\u00a0AandAmom thinks that something medical might be going on. Behavioral problems are not always medical and do not require medications to \"fix\" the behavior. What is going on here is a classic case of non-preventative parenting. We need to parent diffferently if we are going to get different results from our children. Also, I think it is very interesting how many people refer to being a mom as a \"job\". Being a parent is not a job. A job is something we can quit. Being a parent is a choice and a privilege.",
