    "question": "I've been taking Victoza since May 2011 and i've been experiencing shorthness of breath since Nov. 2011, I've had several tests for angina and my lungs and everything are ok. I was wondering if it could be the Victoza that is causing the shorthness of breath. I have diabetes type II and I'm taking Metformin as well as insulin. The Victoza has done wonders, it helps me have a better control and I have lowered my intake of insulin. Can someone help me?",
