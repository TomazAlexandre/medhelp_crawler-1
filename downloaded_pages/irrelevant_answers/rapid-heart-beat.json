I could not continue and eventually, after two hours, went to the emergency ward where they\u00a0\u00a0measured a heart rate of 180 plus that subsided on its own. All tests blood, ECG indicated no heart attack. My question is I had been on the Dr. Atkins diet for 10 days - extreme low carb - could this cause an attack or is there the possiblity of another underlying cause?What is this condition called.",
