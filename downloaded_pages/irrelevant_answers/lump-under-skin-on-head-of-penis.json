            "answer": "Hello,Without examination confirmation of a diagnosis is tough but urge of frequent urination can be due to diabetes mellitus. Other possibilities are glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis(inflammation of the kidneys),urinary tract infection,hypercalcemia,hypokalemia(low potassium),hyperthyroidism and hyperparathyroidism.In my opinion, investigations like kidney functions, blood sugar levels, ultrasound lower abdomen ,intravenous pyelography , thyroid function tests and cystoscopy may be needed to confirm a diagnosis.I sincerely advise you to consult a urologist or nephrologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "Hello,Sorry replied to an earlier question first.This kind of bump can be due to a small cyst which is a harmless and symptomless lump on the penis. The other possibility is of a benign growth but this is less likely because it does not appear overnight. I suggest you to get an examination done from a doctor because without examination, confirmation of diagnosis cannot be done.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "I have had this bump underneath the skin on the head of my penis for several years. In fact, as long as I can remember.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 33 now. There is no pain, but it recently has gotten a bit more pronounced. I have no other issues going on in that region. I have a done a lot of research on the internet and have never seen a picture of this condition. I have started to worry that it could be a cancer, which means I have had it for a very long time.",
