            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!What you feel is probably pain of intermittent claudication where muscles spasm and then relax and then go into spasm again. It is commonly seen in patients with diabetes and hypertension.Another possibility is deep vein thrombosis. This can also cause pain due to poor blood supply to muscles. This can be known by dopplar studies.At times it can be due to a compressed spinal nerve in the lumbar area. This can be detected by nerve conduction studies and by MRI of the spine.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I went from having a job standing up all day to having a desk job. So, when I started getting cramps I thought it was just from sitting down all day. I started exercising when I got home, just to try and counteract the lack of activity. It didn't help at all. They start, and hurt the most, behind my knees and spread up and down. I've started getting tingling in my feet and a sort of pulsing in my thigh. It's kind of freaking me out. I know my diet isn't what it should be, so deficiencies could be a problem, but I'm just not convinced. Please help, this is only one of many problems I have going on, but it's the only one that doesn't make sense! Help!",
