    "question": "ok...I will try to make this as sort as possible so as not to confuse people too much. My best friend has has serious problems with her reproductive organs since she was 12. she has been to multiple doctors and they dont know how to diagnose her. they know she has cysts on her ovaries, and have tried numerous medications but none have helped. they tried switching her birth more than once. she still has severe pain in her abdomen, pelvis and uterus. the dr.'s have assured her it is not cancer, yet the pain is there all the time. most days she has trouble getting out of bed in the morning. she is STD free yet she gets bladder infections at least 3 times every six months. she is only with one romantic partner, and has never had a child. she is a very skinny person by nature and no medicine seems to help her. this pain seems to get her lightheaded and very sore. she has cysts on her breasts also (not sure if this relates to her symptoms). intercourse is painful for her and it keeps her up at night at times. I have no idea what it could be. what should I tell her to ask the doctors to look for? is their any websites that may give her useful info on the topic? any ideas would be helpful as we have all run out of thoughts as to what could be affecting her. I have also thought possible diabetes to be a culprit to her problem as it runs in her family.",
