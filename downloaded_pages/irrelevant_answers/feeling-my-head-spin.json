            "answer": "BeckyGood advice above - get to a doctor. This is not worth ignoring.I gradually started losing my blanance over the last couple of years - found myself leaning on walls and wondering why - headachy - lousy sleep as well.I did research and came down to a couple of things I thought it might be and wow if I wasn't correct after some tests were done.B12 deficiency - it's an epedemic out thereSleep Apnea - I know sleep with a NOMASK and sleep like a babyMy balance has improved to normal....whatever that is.I hope this helps and I am not saying it's the same for you - but the point of the testing is to rule things out and find your cure.Best of luck and let us know how it turns out.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, repeated falling can cause problems. There are many causes of dizziness, lightheadedness, passing out, blackouts etc. It is difficult to comment without examination. I am just enumerating the possible causes. You can discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Dizziness could be due to postural hypotension (blood pressure falling with change of position), internal ear problems and cervical spondylitis or compression of cervical spinal nerves. All these cause dizziness when you get up from lying down position or when you change position that results in a change in the level of your head. Cervical spondylitis and ear problems also cause dizziness on changing the position of the neck.Other causes are anemia, claustrophobia, GERD, hypoglycemia or low sugar and some endocrine problems. Endocrine problems, such as an underactive thyroid (called hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (called hyperthyroidism), adrenal insufficiency (called Addison's disease), low blood sugar levels, and in some cases, diabetes, may lead to hypotension and hence lightheadedness and an off balance feeling.Certain types of epilepsies and seizures too can cause similar symptoms. If you have an accompanying headache then you must also look at benign intracranial hypertension. Heart problems too should be ruled out in your case. If all other tests are normal, maybe an ECHO should be done to rule out mitral valve prolapse. Patent foramen ovale too could be the cause (commonly known as hole in the heart). It can also be chronic fatigue syndrome if all other causes are ruled out. A brain lesion too can cause dizziness but often there are other neurological signs such as numbness, tingling, loss of function of a limb etc.The list is daunting. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
