            "answer": "Those are not necessarily the signs of toxemia, or pregnancy induced hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0But they could be.\u00a0\u00a0Hard to say unless she gets her BP checked.Those signs do warrant her going to the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0If her boss won't let her off, and she can't get him to by telling him that if something happens, he will be responsible, and she can't simply go home sick...then there is nothing she can do about it right now.\u00a0\u00a0She really should put in a call to her doctors office right now...perhaps the nurse there can speak to her boss.If she absolutely can't or won't get in today, she needs to go home and lay down after work and not get up except to go to the bathroom until tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0She should lay on her side to rest.If she develops a headache, continues to have blurred vision, or develops dark urine or abdominal pain, she needs to go to the ER right away.\u00a0\u00a0Right away.",

    "question": "My friend is a week behind me in her pregnancy so she is 29 weeks give or take a day or two. She woke up this morning with blurred vision, dizziness, tingling teeth and lips, and she hasnt felt her kid move today. She works at a gas station and one of her customers is a nurse and said it could be the first signs of Toxemia.... Would Toxemia have such a sudden onset and if not what else could it be? Her boss wont let her leave to get it checked out and her doctors appointment isnt until tomorrow. Should she be worried about it right now? Could she wait until tomorrow to see her doctor?",
