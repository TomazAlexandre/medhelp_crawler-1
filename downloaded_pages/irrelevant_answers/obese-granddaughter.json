            "answer": "I agree with the doctor that the weight issue should definitely be addressed.Drinking mostly water shouldn't make her overweight though.\u00a0\u00a0If she is excessively thirsty I would query diabetes.I heard that children stop wetting the bed, etc when they are ready.\u00a0\u00a0It's possible there's a good reason why it's happening (besides drinking all the water).When you said she never feels full that reminded me of prader-willi syndrome.Maybe setting up a regular bedtime routine would help.\u00a0\u00a0I suspect altering the routine may be a little destabilizing.I have no medical experience so I would strongly recommend following the doctor's advice.Good luck!",

    "question": "My granddaughter is 10 and extremly overweight. Since she was born she never felt full. She doesn't eat sweets and drinks mostly water. She also still wets the bed. We have tried limiting her fluids, making sure she goes to the bathroom before bed, and trying different amounts of sleep time. Nothing works. Her pediatrician doesn't seem worried about either problem, but both are really starting to affect her.",
