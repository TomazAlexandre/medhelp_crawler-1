            "answer": "Im 34 wks and suddenly feeling a lot of niggles I didn't feel before. Im more upset about the fact that Im now in uncharted waters and anything can happen in the next 6 weeks. My bump was measured yesterday and I was told baby is small and need to go for a growth scan and I have gestational diabetes too. I just want all of this unpleasantness and uncertainty to end. I don't mind the niggles if I knew they were normal but some of the symptoms Im feeling these days Im not familiar with and it scares me to think I might need to call the midwife every 5 minutes or go into early labour :( *feeling sorry for myself today*",
