    "question": "I am getting worried about my wife.\u00a0\u00a0she has lost a lot of weight over the past year.\u00a0\u00a0 her bowel movements are perhaps once a week at most and lately, within minutes of eating, her stomach swells up.I have also noticed that with just one glass of wine, she slurs her speech and generally, appears as if she has been drinking four or five!I have been trying to get her to visit her GP but so far, she has not tried to make an appointment.I have spoken to her about the drinking and she acknowledges the situation and says it's been through historic stress.I am concerned with her lack of bowel movements, weight loss and how one drink affects her.she will be 50 this year.",
