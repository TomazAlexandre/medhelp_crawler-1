            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine you and obtain a history and review your MRI, I can not tell you what the exact cause of your symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Hyperintensities are to put it simply white (or bright) appearing signals on specific MRI sequences (such as the T2 sequence). There are multiple causes for such hyperintensities.. Most often, these are due to what is called \"chronic small vessel disease\", literally meaning diseased small vessels that supply blood flow to the brain. This is not an uncommon process in the brain and increases with age. This is not a disease in and of itself but rather is a reflection of unhealthy blood vessels, damaged by years of plaque build-up. This is most often due to a combination of several factors including the following: high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, and high cholesterol. If these factors are well controlled, the damage to the brain can be stabilized and further damage prevented.Other causes of plaques in the brain can be migraine. People with migraine often have plaques on their MRI that are of unclear cause or significance. Other causes of plaques on MRI can usually be distinguished based on history and symptoms, such as symptoms of neurologic deficit (for example arm weakness or difficulty walking etc). These can also be distinguished based on the MRI appearance. These include, but are not limited to, multiple sclerosis, other demyelinating disease, and inflammatory processes such as vasculitis.It is a good idea to discuss the findings on your MRI with your neurologist, to better understand their implications. Also, for continued management of your headaches. If your migraines are not under good control, evaluation by a headache specialist (a neurologist with specialty training in headache medicine) may benefit you.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
