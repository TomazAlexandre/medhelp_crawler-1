            "answer": "Hi,Your diabetes control is fair, but many physicians encourage patients to try to be as well controlled as possible before trying to conceive a child, and that goal is to have an A1C below 7%. You are close, so keep working on it.You cannot spread diabetes to a partner through intercourse, so this is not a concern.Implications for your baby are several: your baby will have a higher genetic predisposition for diabetes overall because you have it., but there is no guarantee either way, or knowing when it may develop. In regard to the pregnancy, you should have an obstetrician who specializes in high risk pregnancies and be followed very closely for the health of your baby and yourself, as well as (most important) very good glucose control. Ths is VERY important during the pregnancy.Your decision to have a child will be up to you and your partner, and should take into account your health at the time. There is no general reason why someone with diabetes should not have children, but you should try to have as good glucose control as possible before trying, and discuss it with your doctor also. Your kidney , eye and heart functions will also need to be taken into account during your preconception planning.Precautions while having sex: only in regard to contraception or prevention of STDs, but none are directly related to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0As with all exercise, if you feel unwell after intercourse be sure to check your blood sugars to make sure they have\u00a0\u00a0not become too low or too high.take care.",

            "answer": "I'm not a doctor but I can tell you your partner will not be infected with diabetes after intercourse - it is not an STD.\u00a0\u00a0There ARE implications to an unborn baby if the mother has diabetes - you should discuss it carefully with your gynae or whoever is delivering the baby - basically, the better your control the less impact it will have on your baby, but do discuss this in depth with your caregiver.\u00a0\u00a0I don't understand your third question and I would suggest only take precautions while having sex with your partner if you don't want to have a baby.\u00a0\u00a0Again, I'm not the doctor, I'm only visiting this site every day while waiting for the doctor to answer my question and answering wherever I can.",
