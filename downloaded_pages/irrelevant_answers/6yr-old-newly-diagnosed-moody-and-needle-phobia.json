            "answer": "Hi Hopesy,I am so sorry to hear about your daughter. I was dianosed when I was 10. I have had t-1 now for 49 yrs. For myself I don't remember battling my mom. I just hated her sticking me with needles. The thing was, she hurt me all the time. She used to give me my shots in the upper arm and they hurt like crazy. I cried everytime. Your daughter is fearing those needles and does not want to be hurt. She is putting the blame on you for her pain and does not understand that she needs her insulin and in order for her to have pain she needs shots. That would be normal at her age. Where do you inject her\u00a0\u00a0insulin? The only place it does not hurt and I mean \"does not hurt\" to inject is in the tummy.One inch away from the belly button all the way around.\u00a0\u00a0Believe me, it does not hurt,. That is where I take my shots. There are no nerve endings there. Nerve endings are what make the shots hurt and anywhere else in giving the shots. I was terrified and I was not 10 yrs old to give myself the shots in the tummy. Again, they do not hurt at all and anyone else will tell you the samething about that.When she is moody it would be her sugars are too high and they have to be brought down to a good reading. I, still. when I have a high, get moody and I have to warn my husband about that. I feel it too. I am crabby, irritable, leave me alone thing. It could be both; her pushing you and the diabetes. She knows there is something she has but does not understand it at her age and because of that will try to get her own way for anything. Do you or your other half know of any other children with t-1?\u00a0\u00a0What about a childrens diabetic camp that lots and lots children go to where she could see how other kids go about things with or witout help, even make a new friend. She could go on the pump instead of having to take shots everyday. Many children are on the pump and if you could get one (talk to her doctor first) she could feel proud and be just like the other kids that are wearing one.When I was diagnosed, I was in a coma and made it back to life by a mere thread. Getting back home my mom did not know how to inject me and she didn't want to hurt her child. My mom called for help and had an inhome nurse come out and teach both of us how to practice. Well, for me, practicing on an orange was not me and not real skin! That's the way it was years ago.It will also take a bit before her sugars are getting leveled being that she was just diagnosed. Keep track of what her sugar readings are before she eats a meal and keep track of what she eats when you can.Her first test should be as she gets up and before she eats breakfast.That way, when you go back to her doctor he/she can see how she is doing and may need an adjustment on her insulin. Just talk to her doctor and tell him/her what is happening. They have to know to help you too. You can also read and read up on diabetes on the web or go to a library. There are classes at clinics or hospitals where parents can go to learn.",

            "answer": "my 4 year old daughter was diagnosed 2 weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0We went through the anxiety of the shots too, but it is getting better.\u00a0\u00a0One thing is we let her tap the syringe for bubbles before each shot and let her pick the site.\u00a0\u00a0She was also put on the pen the other day and that seems to help and she likes to get it out and take the cap off for me.\u00a0\u00a0I think having her be involved has helped.\u00a0\u00a0I will say that she does have moments when she runs and hides and we have to restrain her but they are getting less and less.\u00a0\u00a0As for the behavior, we have seen my daughter become much more naughty the past few days and I don't think it has as much to do with blood sugars as it does to being spoiled due to the diagnosis, so we are trying to not give her more attention than we need to with this disease.\u00a0\u00a0Another thing we let our daughter do is poke our fingers for blood sugar tests.\u00a0\u00a0Just some thoughts.",

            "answer": "I am happy for you that the struggle with this is coming along. I don't know why I didn't think of it too letting your daughter help, duh!\u00a0\u00a0The better involved, the better for her and you. I am on the flexpen too and it's so much easier and no pain for me. Where does your daughter choose to be injected? As I posted to the other, there is NO pain injecting in the tummy. Can I ask you what her sugars are running? Every liitle bit that you can think of to help her and do with her, both of you need. Again, my mom didn't know a thing. It's all a learning process and there is lots to learn. I still learn after all my time with this disease. Take care and keep posting leltting us know how she is doing.",

    "question": "My 6 yr old daughter was diagnosed with type 1 a week ago. Every blood test (prior to meals and bedtime) and every insulin injection (breakfast and tea time) are battles. She runs and hides. We have to pick her up, restrain her and inject her, whilst she kicks, screams and tries to bite. We don't think either hurt too much - she doesn't flinch with finger pricks and asks if the insulin needle is in, two seconds after it went in! After needles there are shouts of \"I hate you two. I want another mummy and daddy!\"The other problem we have, is she is her usual 'good as gold' child 10 % of the time and a child possessed by the devil 90% of the time. We can't do right for doing wrong. She constantly moans about anything and everything and when she doesn't get her own way, has an almighty outburst. Is this my 6 yr old pushing it or the diabetes talking?We are getting very fed up. I dread getting up and crave little one's bed time.Any rays of light out there because this feels like a long tunnel!",
