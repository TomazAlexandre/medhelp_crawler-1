We are learning more and more everyday about diabetes and how it works.\u00a0\u00a0I think that if the government really got on board and started some serious funding we could have this disease licked in under a decade.\u00a0\u00a0Look what a $10 million bounty did for the space program!To answer your question though, yes I do think that they will find a cure soon.\u00a0\u00a0I just hope that I am right and my son doesn't have to suffer any longer than is necessary.",

            "answer": "There is so much research going on now that it is hard to say which is the most promising. But one thing is that it will take a few years of testing and money which both JDRF and ADA spend bunches on. i have had type 1 diabetes for over thirty years now and i would welcome a cure.Too bad that we can't get the conservative politicians, like Bush, to approve more stem cell research, which is one of the studied methods for creating a cure that seems very promising. There is also some methods involving the immune system in type 1's that has some potential, it has been done in lab mice and next will be possible human tests.But there has been some major advances in diabetes care in the last twenty years with the invention of blood sugars home meters and insulin pumps that is helping diabetics live longer and more complication free than before. i remember when i was first diagnosed they told me i wouldn't live to be the age i am now and had things not improved they would have been right. So it isn't a bad thing to hope for a cure but to also keep in the back of your mind that it will take years for testing and development but we are on the horizon.wishing you the best",

            "answer": "I'm another believer and long time diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0My sister & niece have it also.\u00a0\u00a0We're more than ready.I also believe that research is moving along non-embryonic stem cells, for example, evaluating placenta cells or other adult cells.\u00a0\u00a0My guess (tho' I'm not an insider!) is that these sources of stem cells would not cause the same ethical questions that embryonic stem research triggers.\u00a0\u00a0It's also my understanding that stem-cell research is advancing with private monies here in the US and with public-private monies world-wide.I feel certain we'll see a cure in my lifetime.\u00a0\u00a0I'm nearing 50.\u00a0\u00a0I'm thankful for the research that has led to my good quality of life for all these years.\u00a0\u00a0Increasingly, when my family \"exchanges gifts\" for birthdays and other holidays, our gifts are in the form of donations to the charities of one another's choice.\u00a0\u00a0It's a great way to support & encourage the work our loved ones believe in; it's always deeply appreciated; and we don't have to stand in long lines to shop for it!",

            "answer": "Dear butlergrad,I am a mom, with a 28 year-old son with type 1 diagnosed at eight. JDRF's fundraising goes to research for a cure. We have been at this from an original grass root beginning from about 20 couples over, I think, 25 years ago. Since then we have raised over $800,00 million dollars to fund this reseach. Mary Tyler Moore does know what she is talking about and completely believes in a cure sooner than later. The research is growing very rapidly in just the last 5 years with all of the new technolgy that grows everday. I would recommend that you look at the JDRF Website at www.jdrf.org to look at what research we are involved with and funding. There are also other hospitals and research programs involved around the world searching for a cure.I understand that research can seem to go at a slow speed, but it is coming on at a much faster rate. Please remember, that diabetes is a very complicated disease, but we are truly making great strides.Keep hope and as I have been a volunteer for 17 years with the same hope, consider volunteering and taking a pro-active and personal approach.You can find many ways to participate. I know it is a wonderful experience for me to think that at even at a small level I may be a part of finding a cure. I would hope that you think of JDRF for this, but any effort that you make with any Type 1 Charity who is involved with research would be great.I look forward to hearing back from you and wish the best for you and your child.Cure, sonner than later is my motto. (Stolen from a fellow volunteer)From one parent to another and a great thank you for your question.dm",

            "answer": "I would like to say that a cure in this lifetime is a definite possibility boosted by the Swiss referendum on stem cell research this weekend which was overwelmingly accepted at 67% approx that research would be allowed to continue in that country.The Muppet of a US president who has just been reelected much to the chagrin of the developed world (including the coasts of the US) does not help matters however will his ultra conservative, highly religious idiocy cannot last and stem cell research will continiue irrespective of the US backward mentality.Good luck to all you DM1ersall the best",

            "answer": "We also have much leading-edge research in the UK, some of which has been done with islet replacements at Newcastle University.\u00a0\u00a0It has been completely successful for those lucky people who have been able to take advantage (now 9).\u00a0\u00a0However, the criteria are very tight and revolve around those who are constantly on the edge of hypo and very afraid of their lack of control.\u00a0\u00a0There is little help for others who have had Type 1 for many years (like my partner - 46 years old and having had Type 1 for 42 years) and are suffering from the long term effects.He frequently comments that it will be far too late for him, but let's concentrate on doing what we can to enhance and support research.\u00a0\u00a0In the UK the leading organisation is www.diabetes.org.uk if anyone is interested.",
