            "answer": "I don't even see how that possible unless he is planning on having you lose weight which is a big no no. By delivery between the water, baby, placenta, and so forth generally ways 15-20 lbs. I would just eat allot of fruits and veggies. For meat stick with a baked or serred in olive oil chicken. Things like watermelon are great for pregnant women because it's sweet, low calorie if any, and very high in iron. When it comes to starches stick with sweet potatoes, squash, and whole grain. If you like fish a servings of either tuna or salmon are a good choice to have once a week. All of it can be really tasty and healthy if cooked right. :)",
