    "question": "Thank you for reading this!When I eat fatty foods, like meats, butter, nuts, and oils, these symptoms appear:-Tiredness-Mental confusion-Impaired coordination-Dysphoria-Urgency to urinate-Cloudy urineWhen I eat things like oatmeal and beans (fat free), these symptoms do not appear.Today I tried putting vinegar into my urine and it cleared it up.This health problem started around 8 months ago. Significant dietary/health changes I can think of that may have contributed to this would be abstinence from alcohol (a prior moderate drinker), increased fast food consumption, and frequent over-sleeping.About 2 years ago I ate a lot of sweets and started to develop the signs of diabetes (which was not diagnosed because I haven't been to any doctors). I have had the sugar consumption under control for over a year. This may have contributed to this recent health problem.I really appreciate your advice because I am currently unemployed and do not have health insurance.",
