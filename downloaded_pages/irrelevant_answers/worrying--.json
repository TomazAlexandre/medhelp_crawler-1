I'm twenty two weeks and am still down about ten pounds from where I started. My goal is gradual weight gain and only getting to a max of 240 this time!",

            "answer": "I am 5'9\" and was 250 sadly. I've actually lost 11 lbs because of morning sickness. Only 16 weeks though so here's hoping. The only thing that's really been a problem for me is having to do vaginal ultrasound in the beginning cuz of my extra padding. I'm worried about gestational diabetes because that's what happened to my mom and then it turned into type 1 I think? Or is that type 2 when you aren't born with it? Haha, regardless, it is a little riskier but with technology these days, you should be fine.\u00a0\u00a0Hang in there mama!",
