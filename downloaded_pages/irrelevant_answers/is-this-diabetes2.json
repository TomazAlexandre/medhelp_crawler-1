            "answer": "I would have a glucose test done. Some of you symptoms could point to a heart murmur. I have fluttering palpitations too and that's what I have.It's not dangerous, but something you should keep an eye on. Some of the symptoms could point to high or low blood pressure. You could go to a drug store and use the self-blood pressure check just to get a ballpark of where your at. I have been an insulin dependent, type 2 diabetic for over 15 years. I also have high blood pressure, arthritis, depression and anxiety. If you have any questions, please let me know. I'd be glad to give you the information your looking for (to the best of my knowledge), Good luck.",

    "question": "I am having a lot of random symptoms and would like some advice. I plan to see my doctor as soon as she can fit me in but am looking for some advice to what on earth these could mean. I have been very fatigued for a few months. This varies from mild to severe. I also get dizzy from time to time and have (and I am sure about this) quite a bit of kidney pain especially when my bladder is full. My urine is completely normal. I feel nauseous off and on and in just the last week have been having heart palpitations. The palpitations are random and quite quick. For just a few seconds my heart feels very floppy as if it is trying to pump and can't and then poof back to normal. I also shake sometimes right when I start eating. Other times about five minutes after I start eating I feel almost as if I were drunk.\u00a0\u00a0I am asthmatic and have an inhaler I use on average once or twice a week. I am on birth control (sprinted). I take a vitamin d pill almost every day and usually a Claritin. I am not looking for a diagnosis just an idea of what path to look down. I am worried about my kidneys and have a bad family history with diabetes. Should I try to monitor my blood sugar or is this overboard. I am trying to get into my GP but she is booked. I just don't know of I am over concerned or if I should try to see a Dr. ASAP.",
