    "question": "Last night I had sex with a sex worker while out of town on a job. We used protection, but i noticed a little bit of blood on the condom. i asked if she was tested recently for hiv and other stds, she said she was a month ago and was clean, and she always uses protection with clients. But i am concerned if i am at any risk for exposure to hiv and other stds. Should i get tested? also i read alot on here that most people who will seroconvert do so within 6 to 8 weeks for healthy induviduals who do not have comprimsed immune systems. would diabetes count as a comprimised immune system to effect an hiv test?",
