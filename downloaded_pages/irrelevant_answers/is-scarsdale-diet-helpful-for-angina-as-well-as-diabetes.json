            "answer": "Rosco888 i loved reading your post here....i think that is totally amazing what you are experiencing that you haven't had to use the nitro so you definately know that you are on the right path.\u00a0\u00a0To me it could be a number of things...the weight loss took alot of pressure off of your body and eased the angina symtoms thus allowing more oxygen to get thru to your heart muscles...could be yes the beer/wine may very well have something to do with it since wine is loaded with natural sugars, etc. no matter what it is the changes that you have made are definately working for you.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to consider starting a \"journal\" our site or use the \"tracker\".\u00a0\u00a0If you look up at the top of your screen on the Medhelp site you will see the Health Tools bar and can jump into the tracker site and start keeping your own records.\u00a0\u00a0You seem fairly sure that it is either the starches or the alcohol that is responsible but i would take the weight loss into consideration here too Rosco888 because it is so important.\u00a0\u00a0I am definately taking my hat off to you on this one....so congrats on your success and keep up the good work my friend and keep on popping onto the site i enjoy reading your posts to others too.....",

    "question": "I just completed 2 weeks on the Scarsdale Diet, losing a grand total of 5 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0At the beginning of the 2nd week, I switched the lunch menus for the dinner menus so I would eat the fuller meal in the middle of the day when I'm more active.\u00a0\u00a0I increased my physical activity by walking, mowing the grass, vigorously cleaning the house.\u00a0\u00a0My blood glucose levels were lower than they've ever been during this period and since as I've tried to eat moderately and exercise vigorously.\u00a0\u00a0Two weeks is the maximum that one can stay on Scarsdale as it creates a ketosis that can get out of hand if left unchecked.Not only is my blood glucose lower but I've not had any symptoms of angina such as that burning/grinding sensation in the chest requiring a nitroglycerin tablet.\u00a0\u00a0I can jump up in the morning and make up my bed without having to take it slow while my heart wakes up.\u00a0\u00a0And I can walk longer than 5 minutes without needing nitroglycerin to complete my workout.I'm trying to figure out what accounts for these two changes:\u00a0\u00a0the absence of beer/wine in my diet these 2+ weeks, or the absence of starches in my diet.Any thoughts as I continue to monitor the situation?",
