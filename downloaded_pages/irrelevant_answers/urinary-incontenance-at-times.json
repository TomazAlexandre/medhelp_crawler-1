            "answer": "My dog is a 10 year old American Eskimo. Recently she has starting wetting the bed when she is sound asleep. Unfortunately, it is always my bed she is sleeping in when this happens! Can a dog be so comfortable that she loses bladder control when asleep? I have watched her sleeping, and when she feels herself getting wet she jumps up like a rocket and runs to the door. She knows it is unacceptable and has been scolded and temporarily banned from my bed several times. But I eventually go soft and let her back in the bed. She may go for a whole month or two and then it happens again. She used to be a submissive urinater if you leaned over her in a dominant position when she was younger, but she got over that years ago. She takes Rymadil sometimes for arthritis. Does anyone have any thoughts about this situation? Thanks! DRM",

    "question": "Hi there and thank you for reading my question. All answers will be greatly appreciated. I have a 14 year old mixed chow/border collie. For the past couple years, I have noticed a drop or two of urine occasionally on the floor. This past couple weeks, she has been outside to pee and back inside and within a few minutes, her whole hip area covered in urine. This happens about every other day or so. Nothing regular. She just had a physical last weekend and bloodwork and everything was normal. I first thought of a uti, but her wbc would be up and they weren't. Is this just old age??? What can I do, put a diaper/bloomers on her??? The vet felt around and said that he didn't feel that it would be stones causing it. Should I try cranberry capsules??? Please someone help because I have never delt with a senior dog and we love her just like our children. She was our first baby. Does this mean that it is close to time for her to be deceased??? I don't want to keep her here for selfish reasons if she is ready to go even though I can hardly think about it. Any advice will be appreciated. Oh, she does have arthritis and is on a coated aspirin daily along with omega 3 fish oil and glucosamine/msm. She isn't lame yet, though. Thank you in advance and sorry if this is hard to follow.",
