            "answer": "Have you ever tried a straight raw meat/ fish diet? Actual fish and meat? Cat food may be designed for cats, but they are in the end, predators. I've found most stomach issues clear up when you give kitty a natural diet of the above, mixed with boiled plain white rice. most predators are actually omnivorous. however, they get their neccessary greens via their prey's diet.Keep in mind to be really effective, you'd have to go for the more organic cuts. No unnatural antibiotics or steroids in it.I find it hard to beleive his allergies will be an issue if you go this route. Generally most food allergies are activated in animals by the \"unnatural\" ingredients in the food.Also; is your cat on an all dry food diet or wet only?",

            "answer": "Hi, don't feel bad about \"putting the cat through stress\", you are being a responsible, caring daddy to your kitty.\u00a0\u00a0That says a lot!!\u00a0\u00a0There are too many irresponsible pet owners out there that have no business owning anything alive-you are NOT one of them!!My mother's cat was diagnosed with IBD, too-had it for years.\u00a0\u00a0It was diagnosed by colonoscopy, and she was also on steroid injections for about 2 yrs.\u00a0\u00a0She had vomiting-a lot of it.\u00a0\u00a0The steroid injections caused(yes CAUSED) diabetes, and she had to be taken off-and when she was taken off the diabetes went bye bye.\u00a0\u00a0Try googling \"steroids and diabetes\", it's interesting what comes up.\u00a0\u00a0But, I will make a bet that once your kitty comes off of steroids then the diabetes will also go away.By the way, we later found out that the so-called IBD was really caused by giardia, this is a protozoan-kind of like a parasite.\u00a0\u00a0This is a separate specific test, not sure if this is a blood test, poop test or what-but I do know that it's different from the vet's typical worm test.\u00a0\u00a0If your cat was a stray, then there's a real good chance that he might have this weird \"bug\".Hope this helps!!",

He was put on prescription food, Royal Canin HypoallergenicMy vet provided 5 types of trial food, venison, deer etc to see which one he would eat. (He is a picky eater) He sniffed all the others and went for the HypoallergenicSince he has been on the medicine and food now, he stopped vomiting and diarrhea and actually gained weight. His fur grew back on his stomach as he was constantly licking away at his stomach before treatment.I wish you and your kitty well",

            "answer": "My 12 year old cat has had IBD for 10 years. In addition to\u00a0\u00a0Cerenia, Buprenex, Reglan 2.5 mg. twice daily, Pepcid 2.5 mg. twice daily, and Prilosec 5 mg. twice daily, she only eats Royal Canin Feline Hypoallergenic food (this is a hydrolyzed soy food) -- this is the only food she tolerates and is only available in dry form. Additionally, every 6 hours she receives 1/8 tsp. of Intestamine , 1/2 a supplied scoop of Rx Clay and about 1/10 of a capsule of Walgreen's Super Probiotic (all 3 of these are available without a prescription) and these are mixed into a quantity of her food that has been pre-mixed with water with a hand mixer into a wet paste which I then finger feed to my cat. Initially it took a little getting used to for my cat to accept the finger feedings but she has been doing fine with them for several years. She has never taken steroids-- I had another cat with IBD several years ago who died of steroid-related complications within 2 years of initiation of steroids. She also receives Vitamin B 12\u00a0\u00a0by subcutaneous injection 1ml. twice weekly, Adequan 0.1ml. IM twice weekly, and injectable IM glucosamine 0.5ml. twice weekly. The glucosamine and additional helpful products may be obtained by calling (303)702-1986 and requesting a telephone vet consult. I hope this was helpful to you. This treatment regimen has saved my cat's life.",

            "answer": "God Bless you dad. That is going the extra 10 miles for your baby. I finally gace in to Budesonide (a artificial steroid) because nothing was working--This has been the answer for my Mia. I know I may be causing her an early death from steroid complications, but she will go out having a pain-free happy playful life. She was just miserable before this.I also give Mia a special diet HILLS\u00a0\u00a0Z/D formula wet and dry expensive but she only eats this with no other vitimans or probiotics---well if I had to depend on her taking meds from me she would have been gone a long time ago. Everything she gets has to be specially formulated in liquid form......and then she hides everytime she hears the med cap undone. What eBIG EARS she has.All the Best, CML",

            "answer": "Hi there, I can't speak to IBD at all, but it seems you got lots of good advice on this post. My cat has been on prednisone for one year (not for IBD, but a different issue) and we started at 5mg twice a day and slowly weaned down to our current dose of 2.5 daily. We can't drop below 2.5 daily or it becomes ineffective. I spoke to my vet a couple weeks ago about alternatives because living on prednisone is dangerous (and my cat's only 3) but there really aren't any good alternatives, so we're stuck. I know to some people this might sound silly, but my vet recommended acupuncture (there is someone at his office who practices it) and he said it can work as an anti-inflammatory. When I googled it later that day there was lots of anecdotal info about its effectiveness for issues such as IBD. Might be worth a try since it's non-invasive. Apparently many cats tolerate it well and just relax into it.",

    "question": "My sweet 4.5 year old cat, has had IBD for most of his life.\u00a0\u00a0Our former vet suggested 1.25mg of prednisone every other day combined with a special diet - Hill's prescription z/d.\u00a0\u00a0We followed this regime for most of his life until about 6 months ago when Hudson started vomiting and having loose stools.\u00a0\u00a0A new vet suggested a new diet:\u00a0\u00a0Hill's d/d in venison and a stronger course of prednisone:\u00a0\u00a05mg twice daily for a week, 5mg once daily for a week, then 2.5mg once daily for a week, 2.5mg every other day for a week, and so on until we were back down to the 1.25mg every other day.\u00a0\u00a0The prednisone did not seem effective, so we switched to prednisolone.\u00a0\u00a0In any case, for about 2 months Hudson was on a very high dosage of these anti-inflammatories.\u00a0\u00a0He developed diabetes and pancreatitis and had to be hospitalized for 10 days!\u00a0\u00a0We have now switched to 1mg of Budesonide a day to help with the inflammation and to try and bring the diabetes under control, we are giving our cat 1cc of insulin a day and we have switched his diet to Nature's Variety Instinct brand of cat food in the rabbit formulation.\u00a0\u00a0Our cat also gets 1/2 tablet of viokase 16 before each meal to help him digest his food as he was having very loose stools and urinating throughout the house.I feel absolutely awful about the trauma our cat is going through.\u00a0\u00a0And about how he is now diabetic (which I understand is transient in cats).\u00a0\u00a0The hardest part is trying to figure out what I can feed him that will not cause an allergic reaction as chicken, turkey, duck, all fish and seafood, and now venison, are off the table.I have great faith that he will soon be better...but some days it's just hard.\u00a0\u00a0Can someone just let me know if they've been through a similar ordeal or give me a sense that I'm travelling down the right path?",
