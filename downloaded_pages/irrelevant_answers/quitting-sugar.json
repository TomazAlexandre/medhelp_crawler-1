            "answer": "HiFrom the description of your struggles with sugar, it really sounds like you may be a sugar addict. Please see the list of criteria below, to see if this fits - it certainly sounds like it does.You will need to figure out if you are a food addict. Struggles with sugar alone are not enough of an indication.\u00a0\u00a0Our brains are hard wired to desire the energy dense 'hit' that sugar gives\u00a0\u00a0us. The food industry has created foods that will make all of us salivate for their products - whether we are addicted or not, we will want them. If you are not an addict, knowing that you must cut down on your sugar (esp since your doctor told you to) should be enough of a motivation to cut down to safer levels, perhaps a desert once or twice a week. You were able to do this in the past. Your attempt to do a fluid detox followed by healthy eating and strong support might be enough.But if you are a food addict, you will find that no matter how hard you try, you inevitably give in and eat too much sugar again.The reason why it is important to know if you are a sugar (food) addict is because this will determine your solution.If you are an addict, the solution is simple: you cannot occasionally have sugar (anymore than you can occasionally have cocaine or alcohol if you are addicted to those). Rather, you will have to completely stop eating them. No more deserts each night or even on the weekend.Please have a look at my website at addictionsunplugged.com for more info on food addiction, as well as some resources to help you stop. For example, there are a number of 12 step programs that are available for the food addict, looking at how to manage food from the addiction framework. If you answer yes to a number of these questions, you may want to call these groups, since it is very difficult to stop any addiction, especially food, on your own. They will give you lots of support.You can also look at my website for more information: addictionsunplugged.comThe 20 questions for food addiction:1.

    "question": "I'm starting a journey today to quit sugar.I've tried cutting back in the past without much success, and its becoming clear to me that sugar has a pretty big hold on my life.\u00a0\u00a0 I dont wan that anymore.\u00a0\u00a0I find I turn to sugar most when i am stressed, usually in the form of anything chocolate or peanut butter.\u00a0\u00a0I will literally eat around 2000 or more calories of this junk in one setting when I feel an \"attack\" come on.I quit sugar once before back in 2010, but after the birth of my son, found that i quickly drifted back to my crutch due to sleep deprivation.I will also mention that I am at higher risk for developing diabetes type 2 later in life because I have had gestational diabetes before.I am tired of feeling like I have no control over my stress, sugar intake and life.I am ready for a change.I'm starting today with a fast/fluid detox,\u00a0\u00a0to be followed by healthy eating (a previous gestational diabetes diet I have been on that was well-balanced).\u00a0\u00a0I know that this, along with support and check-ins will help me kick my habit.I'm hoping others will join in with poating their progress and stories :)Here goes day 1!",
