            "answer": "Hi there!If the blood pressure and cholesterol are just at the upper limit, I would suggest diet modification and regular exercise and getting repeat tests in 4-6 weeks, before considering medications. Regarding victoza, if the side effects are severe/ intolerable, the medication can be substituted with other drugs that are better tolerated. Also diet control and exercise are again vital for adequate diabetic control. I would suggest consulting a qualified nutritionist to chalk out a diet chart that would suit your needs and consider discussing the change in diabetic medications with your doctor.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
