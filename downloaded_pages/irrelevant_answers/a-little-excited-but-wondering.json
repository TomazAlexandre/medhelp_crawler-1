            "answer": "Have you had any complications with this pregnancy? Has your doctor checked your cervix?I have weekly NST and biophysical testing (a focused ultrasound that looks at specific things, such as amniotic fluid volume, movement, practice breaths, etc) because of my advanced maternal age and (mostly) because I developed Gestational Diabetes and have been taking insulin (insulin can cause deterioration of the placenta and GDM can cause issues with the baby).With my son, I had an NST three times each week because I went over 40 weeks.With my current pregnancy, since baby is doing well the current plan is for me to go to term, no induction. With my son his NSTs eventually showed he was under stress so I was scheduled for an induction.",

            "answer": "There is growing evidence that barring complications, it is best to avoid early induction. So unless there is something wrong, it is better to not induce before 40 weeks.",

    "question": "I went to the doctor yesterday, my doctor told me he wanted to do a nst thats where they monitor the baby and see if im having any contractions. He wants me to do another one friday then next tuesday he wants to do an ultrasound to see how everything is looking with the fluid and everything else. Then he told me we will go from there??? Does this mean I might be getting induced next week or what? I been having this on my mind since he said that.",
