            "answer": "My mother in law has three kids and says each pregnancy was totally different. With her first (a boy) she didnt have any sickness at all and didnt gain much weight, with second (a girl) she was sick and threw up the whole pregnancy and didnt gain much weight and with her last one (a girl) she was only sick her first trimester but was huge and she had problems with losing weight after she gave birth. So i guess its normal to have completely different pregnancies with each baby :)",

    "question": "Is anyone else finding their second pregnancy totally different to their first? My first was so smooth, no sickness,\u00a0\u00a0no bad back no real tiredness, this time round I feel like I've been hit by a bus feeling sick everyday, not sure if that's working a 30 hour week and having an 8 year old son but definitely feel this one is different so wondering whether it's a girl this time around. I'm 12 weeks have my next scan on Friday.",
