    "question": "The signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism vary widely, depending on the severity of hormone deficiency. At first, you may barely notice any symptoms, such as fatigue and sluggishness, or you may simply attribute them to getting older. But as the disease progresses, you may develop more obvious signs and symptoms. Signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism include:Fatigue and sluggishnessIncreased sensitivity to coldConstipationPale, dry skinA puffy faceHoarse voiceAn elevated blood cholesterol levelUnexplained weight gain - occurring infrequently and rarely more than 10 to 20 pounds, most of which is fluidMuscle aches, tenderness and stiffness, especially in your shoulders and hipsPain and stiffness in your joints and swelling in your knees or the small joints in your hands and feetMuscle weakness, especially in your lower extremitiesExcessive or prolonged menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia)DepressionWithout treatment, signs and symptoms gradually become more severe and your thyroid gland may become enlarged (goiter). In addition, you may become more forgetful, your thought processes may slow, or you may feel depressed.",
