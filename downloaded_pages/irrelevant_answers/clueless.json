            "answer": "Thank you for answering.My doctor prescribed me Meclizine 12.5 mg to treat the dizziness, saying it's not very strong. It left an impression of dried mouth and numbed tongue, and makes you a little tired for a hour. I'm not really sure how long the healing will take knowing of my celiac disease, but I already feel much better. I am really active today, which is an awesome sensation.",

    "question": "Good morning.I started to become sick 2 years ago, after a big amount of stress, I fainted. I woke up that day covered of sweat, with saliva on my cheek and I peed on me. And then multiple symptoms appeared. Huge weight-loss, nausea, vomiting, intense thirst, abdominal pains, tiredness, weakness, insomnia and died skin around the ankles were the first symptoms. I had been checked for diabetes (which I'm not), celiac (which I am), ovarian check-up (nothing, not even a cyst), hypothyroidism (which I got), anemia (I have a severe anemia as well). After taking iron, b12 vitamins and levothyroxine treatment, I felt a little better for about 3 months. But recently, about a month now, new symptoms appeared : extreme dizziness (I can even drive anymore), blurry vision, extreme fatigue, plus the \"usual\" vomiting and again weight-loss. I took an appointment but it will take a few weeks before they can check on me. Can you please help me? And maybe, find a way to ease my sickness until my doctor appointment. Thank you.",
