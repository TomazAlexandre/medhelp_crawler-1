    "question": "Okay so the week before last I went to my doctor and she checked my blood sugar thing and was happy about my sugars. Well I told her my sugar did spike up to 150 something but explained that I went walking and it went down to like 90. She saw it on the tester thing so she knew I wasn't lying. Well tonight it went up to 136. It was raining and I couldn't go walking. So I'm wondering what is considered uncontrolled GD? I've been doing really good and since the 150 something spike my sugars haven't been over 100.",
