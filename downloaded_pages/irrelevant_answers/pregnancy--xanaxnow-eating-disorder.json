            "answer": "Thak you for your reply...I have tried psychotherapy in many occasions and unfortunately it does not seem to help me. I do know that my grandfather suffered from this disorder and two of my aunts did as well. Could it be genetic ?? They have now prescribed Celexa...Is that safe during pregnancy ?? I know that they rather you not take Xanax during pregnancy, but I think that for me the benefits would outweigh any risk....I know that during pregnancy the best thing would be to be on NO medications. I would literally go insane, and wouldn't that hurt my baby more ?\u00a0\u00a0I wish that the therapy would have helped.....I have tried it in many occasions throughout my life and it did nothing for me. I am so scared to add more medication into my body which may not work...and then have to stop it and go through the withdrawal of it if I do get pregnant. Why don't they treat this disorder as any other...like diabetes or high blood pressure?? They depend on their meds everyday.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I am treated more like an addict then a person with a disororder! Any suggestions on how to talk to my doctor about this situation ??\u00a0\u00a0Does Celexa make you gain weight ?? I know these are so many questions to answer....but I am running out of answers and time as far as being a mommy goes....Please help !",

    "question": "I am 36 yrs. old and I suffer from severe GAD. I have been on Xanax for the past 5 yrs. At first I started taking it with Paxil and then got switched to Zoloft (gained about 60lbs). I stopped the Zoloft since I felt it was really not helping me with the anxiety issues, and making me feel more depressed about myself...because of the way I looked. I had an unexpected pregnancy about 6 months ago that ended in a threatened miscarriage. The OB doctor said that the medication did not cause the miscarriage. When I found out I was pregnant (7-8 weeks) they did blood work and the HCG level was just not rising like it should, so my OB recommended a D&C. When I first found out about the pregnancy I started doing some research on xanax and pregnancy, and my anxiety was at its highest point ever.....I was so worried about taking this medication during pregnancy that I could not eat or sleep....crying all day long worried about everything. I knew I could not stop the xanax........I can not function without it. Now I am underweight.... ever since the pregnancy... I can not seem to get hungry, and If I do feel hungry and try to eat I get sick to my stomach. My question to you is....what is your advice on this med while pregnant ??\u00a0\u00a0I know what has caused my eating pattern to change. My psych doc has be very worried because she is trying to lower my dosage on the xanax and try to put me on an SSRI...which I refuse to take. Like I said, I have been on them before and have done nothing for me as far as anxiety goes. I am just so worried about everything...I want to become pregnant again, but this anxiety disorder is the only thing that is keeping me from it. Please Help! Any advice is so greatly appreciated !",
