            "answer": "Why is her sugar staying high during the day and not responding to insulin until late in the afternoon when it drops out of sight?\u00a0\u00a0I don't understand.\u00a0\u00a0I had her surgery moved up so we can get this over with.\u00a0\u00a0It's hard to know what to do about taking insulin when you don't know when it will take affect.",

            "answer": "Don't take this personally or the wrong way. I was diagnosed when I was 9 and my mom (though I was not as brittle, or sick as your daughter) couldn't stop asking questions and was so afraid my life was going to be nothing. The questions were great (though I didn't think so at the time), and her fears never came true. I am now a teacher for a small school district and feel I am successful and have made it through many hurdles. I have to say though I dont have many answers to your questions, the advice I would give you is to ask anyone and everyone the same question twice. I do. I always need answers and opinions. Then, don't scare or instill a fear in your daughter of not being able to carry on a normal life. Not all things are permanant and since this is all fairly new to your family, kinks will eventually work themselves out. As a mother to another mother, and a diabetic who love her mom, just be patient and encouraging, and you yourself be encouraged, because there is a whole wealth of people on this forum and in the world who will stand behind you. Feel free to e-mail me if you ever need to vent. Good luck, and God Bless you and your family.",
