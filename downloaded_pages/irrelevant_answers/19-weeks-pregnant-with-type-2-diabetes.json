I live on handfuls of almonds, peanuts, walnuts, and cashews.\u00a0\u00a0Cheese!.\u00a0\u00a0All of those things have latent carbs, it can't be helped.\u00a0\u00a0But I won't kowingly sit down and consume a plate of pasta, rice, or potatoes; I just won't do it.\u00a0\u00a0No cookies, donuts, or candy.\u00a0\u00a0This ideology has worked for me, and now works for my daughter.\u00a0\u00a0I set out not to go on a diet, but to establish a new lifestyle of eating, and I've found that if I stay away from foods rich in carbs, regardless of their \"quality\", I don't find myself sliding down the slippery slope.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps this may work for you as well.",
