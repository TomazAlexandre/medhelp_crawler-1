            "answer": "Hi!You are probably talking about Hidradenitis suppurativa, which presents as recurrent boil-like pus-like discharge abscesses resulting in difficult-to-heal open wounds and scarring. It commonly occurs on apocrine sweat gland-bearing skin such as in the groin, and the underarms. It is also known as \u2018acne inversa\u2019. The disease can spread to genitals. It can also be due to staphylococcal skin infections.Wash skin with antiseptic lotions daily to decrease bacteria. Treatment is by topical antibiotics and steroids. Local antibiotics of erythromycin and Clindamycin group also help. Retenoid group of drugs also help. Wear loose fitting clothes. Get your diabetes status checked as high blood sugar can also cause recurrent boils. Consult a skin specialist. Take care!",

    "question": "Hello,I have been getting sores and bumps in my upper inner thighs (slightly lower than the scrotum) and in my pelvic region for over a year now. There are no sores or bumps on my penis or scrotum, however there are around those areas. It would be usually one or two at a time in both areas, about 1-2 centimeters wide for my pelvis and anywhere from 1-5 centimeters on my inner thighs. it would start out as a bump but later fill with pus and eventually break. when the pus is done coming out there is a cut in the shape if a circle that is left that stings to the touch. When i have an open sore it is extremely uncomfortable to walk or sit down because the sores get rubbed as i walk or sit. I am 15 and not sexually active so i am curious as to what this is exactly and how i can fix this problem.Thank you.",
