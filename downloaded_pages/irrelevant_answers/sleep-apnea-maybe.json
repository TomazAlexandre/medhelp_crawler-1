            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The palpitations or perception of heart sounds could be due to your thyroid disorder. You have to have your thyroid status assessed for this.In the initial phases of the sleep cycle and while awakening, we tend to be more conscious or alert. If we study the brain waves at these phases they tend to show the alert wave pattern, this could cause the awareness. If it is not interfering with your sleep schedules you don't have to worry. If it persists or is troublesome consult your doctor for assessment.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Understand your predicament.Diabetes Mellitus and Hypothyroidism could cause the symptoms described by you. A simple blood test could help detect diabetes and hypothyroidism. Hope mam, these have been ruled out. A disorder called fibromyalgia can produce these symptoms (tenderness). Others like malabsorption syndromes, diverticulitis, Chron's disease, ulcerative colitis and parasitic infections can cause the symptoms described by you. Discuss these options with your doctor when you happen to meet him next time.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
