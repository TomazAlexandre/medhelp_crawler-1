            "answer": "Your fasting levels are within normal range [60/70 to 99 mg/dl]. Fasting levels are a snapshot of your glucose taken at the time of test. It doesn't tell you what your glucose was two hours, a week or month prior to the test. That is why the results of an A1c test converted to eAG [daily estimated Average Glucose] provides a clearer picture.Question to you is how long - in hours - after lunch is \"Post lunch\"?",

And asked me to go for the diagnosis of creatinine and ultrasound of bladder with prevoid and postvoid and liver size,kidney sizes and some other things..Everything came out normal(kidney sizes,liver sizes,prevoid,postvoid,cretinine report) and also i did not notice any change in thirsty levels.Urologist suggested me to measure how much water intake i am taking per hour and how much is coming out as urine per hour for three days.. Based on these he is going to give medication..So i started measuring my urine from today :)",
