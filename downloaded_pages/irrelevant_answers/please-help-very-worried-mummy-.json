    "question": "Please help!This question is about my 2 year old son .. towards the end of September my son started vomiting. It could be at random times or just at night time. He could be sick up to 10 times a day. He had no other symptoms with this or a fever he has hardly any appetite. This is still happening now. On Sunday night he was throwing up thick green bile. 2 months we have had this. He stopped for 2 weeks at the beginning of October then it came back out of no where. I have seen 10 different doctors about this. And none of them have a clue what is going on. I have tried gavison for acidreflux/ digestion. I have been prescribed antibiotics for suspected infections none of which have worked. hrs has had blood tests for diabetes and urine tests all of which were fine. He ended up on the children's ward yesterday as he hadn't urinated for 30 hours. Once he had a wee we were discharged. He seems to be worse at night time (he hadn't been to sleep before vomiting) and he can vomit up to ten times. This isn't fair on my little boy any more and I need answers! Please does anybody have any idea to what this could be! X",
