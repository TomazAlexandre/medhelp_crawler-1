These can send out runnersunder the skin that aren't visible & continue to enlarge belowsurface. A Basal will often crust, heal, almost disappear, thencrust again. These can change into a squamous cell & enlarge.If ck'd by a Derm., they can do small punch biopsy to determinewhat it is. Each time you shower or move around, you willirritate spot.

            "answer": "HI. I agree with some of the others. Don't pick at the scab. My mother had the same problem and she didn't think anything of it. She let it go for over a year before she finally went to the doctor. When she did go they did a biopsy and found out it was malinoma skin cancer. They had to cut it out of her leg. It was a hole that was 2 inches in diameter and an inch deep. She has to go in for evaluations and testing every 3 months to make sure that it has not spread. They caught it just in time and got it removed, and she got away with not needing chemotherapy. So please go have it looked at before its too late. Keep us updated.",

It's about the size of a grain of rice and it's not like most scabs. It's not as dry and flaky as most normal scabs are. But it is a redish color. I've played lots of sports over the years, so I figured I just got injured and it just needed a lot of time to heal.I just wanted to share my story so that others that read this won't think that they are alone. I'm going to my dermatologist as soon as I get home for summer break.Thanks for the rest of these comments! They really helped!",

The scabs are protective coverings for healing to happen underneath and should never be played with. A scraping from the wound should be cultured. Also you need to test for diabetes.Hope this helps.

    "question": "Dear Doctors,A few months ago I noticed a small wound on the right side of my lower back. It was scabbed over, so I left it alone to run its course and heal. However, I noticed weeks later that it had not healed completely, and that it remained a scabbed-over wound. I picked the scab, applied a band-aid and antibiotic and hoped that would help it to fully heal. However, it did not. The wound has not healed completely, it just remains scabbed over. What could be the cause of this and what can I do to make the wound heal completely?",
