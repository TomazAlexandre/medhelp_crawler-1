            "answer": "I'll dig a bit deeper for you, but I know that the first pump *I* saw was over 21 years ago (the age of my niece who was born to my sister with DM, too).It had very few features and, while my sister pumped during both her pregnancies to ensure the best possible environment for her children to develop in, she hated the experience so much she is not at all interested in ever pumping again.Check back ...
