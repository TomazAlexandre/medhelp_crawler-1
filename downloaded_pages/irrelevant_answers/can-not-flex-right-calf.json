            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine you and obtain a history, I can not tell you whether or not you have ALS nor what causes the discrepancy in calf flexion that you have noticed. However, it is safe to say that ALS is often suggested by the clinical examination so that if the neurologist you did not feel it was ALS clinically he could say that with a certain degree of confidence.It is difficult to understand exactly what you are describing with your calf but it may be that the calf muscle is weak. If this is the case, you may for example find some difficulty standing on your toes on that leg. The causes of calf muscle weakness are multitude. The calf muscle is innervated by a nerve called the tibial nerve. A neuropathy is any sort of irritation or damage to a nerve, and one potential cause of calf muscle weakness is tibial neuropathy. this is entirely unrelated to ALS. Causes of tibial neuropathy could be compression (particularly in overweight people, it can be compressed as it passes in the knee area), certain inflammatory problems, trauma, even diabetes. There are multiple causes. A problem in the nerve higher up, such as its origin where it exits the spine, could be another possibility such as due to a herniated disc etc, but other muscles would likely be involved and there would be some sensory loss as well.Another possibility is that there could be a muscle problem, but this is usually associated with pain.It is a good idea to followup with your neurologist at your next scheduled appointment and discuss any symptoms and concerns with him/her.Thank you for using the forum I hope you find this information useful good luck",

            "answer": "Did the doc check for babinski and clonus in that leg? How about reflex tests in our body. I've been through the ALS testing process form beginnning to end and its my understanding that it starts at either the bulbar muscles(mouth area and throat) or the body. But for you to loose strength in ALS that quickly is not common, according to what I have found out. Is your foot weak as well or is it just your calf that is giving you trouble? Is there pain? Cramping?",

    "question": "HiI have been twitching constantly in my calfs not for 12 weeks, i have just been for my first Neuro appointment and was told i do not have ALS after a clinical exam.\u00a0\u00a0I have to go back in 4-5 weeks for an EMG to see if they can see what is causing the twitching.Since my clinical i have just noticed that i can not flex my right calf (where it twitches the most)\u00a0\u00a0I can flex the left one fine and its rock hard, however when i flex my right calf it flexes for about 2-3 seconds then i just can not hold that flex and its goes soft, and when it is flexed its not as hard as the left one is.Is this something to worry about? and i know i have been given the all clear with regards of ALS but could this mean that i may actually have it?Thanks allchris",
