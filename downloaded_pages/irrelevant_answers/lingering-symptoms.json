            "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your symptoms. Your initial symptoms do sound like benign positional vertigo (related to the inner ear). But with the tingling on\u00a0\u00a0the right side of the body, a formal neurological exam and possibly an MRI of the brain should be considered to make sure nothing is wrong up there. With pregnancy, you can get nerve disorders in your hands and legs due to compression by the excess tissue/water like carpal tunnel syndrome. Also, an MRI during pregnancy is not warranted unless there is an emergency and you are late stage. Talk to your doctor about seeing a neurologist. If everything looks ok on exam, then the diagnoses that you're concerned about are less likely and you can wait for a more extensive workup after the pregnancy. Best of luck.",
