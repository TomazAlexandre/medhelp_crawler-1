            "answer": "I have gd, it's not fun. You are considered high risk and will begin seeing an obgyn every two weeks. The plus side is that everything is monitored and you'll hear baby's heart twice a month, so if something isn't right they'll definitely catch it. The down side is tracking your sugars. I'll never, ever get used to poking my own finger. With the right diet, it's very easily controlled, their biggest concern, according to my doctor, was a high birth weight and my health post partum. If you don't control diabetes during pregnancy, it could become long term type two. Just do everything the doctors say, and you should be just fine. There isn't anything you can do once you have it so just breathe and roll with it babe ;)",

            "answer": "I was seven weeks at my one hour and eleven weeks at my three hour. They said it was so early that I was probably already diabetic and just never noticed. My family history and my being overweight were factors. But each case is different. If you do have it just buckle up and hold on tight cause it's not goin anywhere. Eat veggies and protiens and very few carbs. Trade out sugar for splenda and just try not to go insane in the process doll.",
