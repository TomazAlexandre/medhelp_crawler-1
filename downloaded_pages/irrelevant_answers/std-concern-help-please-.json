    "question": "Hello.I was recently at my gynecology office getting my annual exam, and I informed my doctor that I thought I had a pimple in my genital region and when she examined it told me that she didn't think it was a pimple and asked if I would be interested in getting an STD screening. I get tested for this every year, and since she was already sending me for blood work because she thought I presented signs of diabetes, she ordered a herpes screening as well. Two weeks later I was back in the office, and she told me she was confused by the results. HSV-1 and HSV-2 both came back negative, but it came back positive for acute herpes and I believe the number was 1.08. So just a few days ago, I went back to the same lab and had the test redone. I can't say that I've ever been tested before, which probably means I haven't been. I have been with the same partner for four years now, but unfortunately he had an indiscretion two years ago. Neither of us have had symptoms, or that we think are/were symptoms, and I was also tested for STDs as soon as I was made aware of his infidelity. I suppose my former gynecologist only tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea, which came back negative, and still are.I guess my questions are whether or not the test could have been a false positive, what \"acute herpes\" actually means, and why both HSV-1 and 2 come back negative and acute come back positive.",
