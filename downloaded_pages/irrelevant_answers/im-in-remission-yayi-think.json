I've been on Methimazole for most of that time.\u00a0\u00a0I went off it and doing the low-iodine diet getting ready to have RAI therapy. Two weeks later,\u00a0\u00a0I had labs done to see how much radiation I was going to need and the labs were normal.\u00a0\u00a0So, I stayed off an additional 4 weeks, had labs done, and they were ALSO normal.\u00a0\u00a0TG I didn't have the radiation unnecessarily!",

IF only I would have known about Graves and Hyperthyroid before I trusted\u00a0\u00a0the endo - I may not be so miserable at times now. and like the walking dead for 6 yrs after RAI.This stripped me of the life I had - I am better after 6 yrs - but not me - at least not who I was.I am happy you are better.",

It seems very plausible to me that you very right and probably are in remission -- just makes sense!\u00a0\u00a0But, the question is, like the other diseases, how long will it last?\u00a0\u00a0I hope a good long, long time!!!

I still kind of wonder how far into \"remission\" I really am as I still get those \"heart flutters\" every once in a while and 2 days last week, I felt so wired, like I'd had 3 cups of coffee, but I've had almost no caffeine since doing the low iodine diet almost 2 months ago. (I do have a soda once in a while)\u00a0\u00a0I think I'm going to see my primary doctor and have him explain more to me about this plus diet guidlines since I've gained a LOT of weight back and I was already overweight to begin with.",
