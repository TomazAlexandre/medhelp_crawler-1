            "answer": "Welcome to the forum. I am sorry you are having all of these problems, especially at such a young age.There is a correlation between some of the diseases you mentioned and Hepatitis C. At the bottom of my post I am including a couple of links to articles about extrahepatic\u00a0\u00a0(outside of the liver) manifestations of Hepatitis C.\"Several studies have found that between 70-74% of HCV patients experience extrahepatic manifestions. Some of the most common symptoms and conditions reported include fatigue, arthralgias (joint pain), paresthesias (feeling of numbness and tingling), myalgias (muscle pain), pruritus (severe itching), sicca syndrome (dryness of the mouth and eyes), insulin resistance, type II diabetes, kidney disease, thyroid disease and many other conditions. Many of the conditions have in some way been related to cryoglobulin (an abnormal blood protein) production.\"\u00a0\u00a0.....\"Cryoglobulinemia is one of the most common disorders associated with hepatitis C. .....Cryoglobulinemia can affect the skin, kidneys, nerves and joints. Conditions associated with cryoglobulinemia include vasculitis(inflammation of the blood vessels), peripheral neuropathy, Reynaud\u2019s Phenomenon (hands that are sensitive to cold temperature and turn white, red, blue), and Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic tissues)......Vasculitis (essential cryoglobulinemic vasculitis) is the inflammation of blood and lymphatic vessels and is caused by cryoglobulins \u2013 antibodies that precipitate (clump together) under cold conditions and dissolve on rewarming. Vasculitis is associated with hepatitis C-related cryoglobulinemia (see cryoglobulinemia above). Symptoms includepurpura (discoloration of the skin caused by bleedingvessels) petechiae, (red pin point rash caused by minor hemorrhaging), and usually affects the lower extremities of the body. Other symptoms include fever, itching welts, muscle ache and pain and enlarged lymph nodes as well as peripheral neuropathy.\"http://www.hcvadvocate.org/hepatitis/factsheets_pdf/Extrahepatic.pdf\"Arthritis. HCV infection has been associated with an oligoarticular or polyarticular nonerosive arthritis that can clinically mimic rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid factor may be positive, although anti-CCP antibodieshave generally not been detected.\"\"Hepatitis C infection: A systemic disease\"Mixed cryoglobulinemiaSj\u00f6gren (sicca) syndromeLymphoproliferative disordersPorphyria cutanea tardaMembranoproliferativeglomerulonephritisNeuropathyCryoglobulinemic(leukocytoclastic) vasculitisCorneal ulcers (Mooren ulcers)Thyroid diseaseLichen planusPulmonary fibrosisType 2 diabetesSystemic vasculitis (polyarteritis nodosa,microscopic polyangiitis)Arthralgias, myalgias,inflammatory polyarthritisAutoimmune thrombocytopeniahttp://www.ccjm.org/content/72/11/1005.full.pdfHere is an article about MS and Hep C:http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/jir.2007.0049",

            "answer": "The above posters have given great answers.\u00a0\u00a0All I have to add is my own experience.Not knowing I had HCV I had to have my salivary gland removed in 1995, at the time the surgeon wanted me tested for HCV. I was and it came back false neg. Later it was found my thyroid was not working wellIn 2006, I started getting red and purple splotches on my lower legs which was Cryogloublinemia it is is a protein the body creates to fight the HCVI also have the spider nevi. little red dots that look like a spider.Before treating a year ago I had terrible leg pains, as well as a heavy feeling in legs and neuropathy..\u00a0\u00a0I also had rheumatoid arthritis or so the blood work and my pain level indicated however the RA doc said it was related to the HCV.\u00a0\u00a0I was also diagnosed with diabetes another problem that can be related to HCV.\u00a0\u00a0I had a friend who died of his extra hepatic syndromes, Lymphoma, Leukemia.\u00a0\u00a0I have not heard about MS however I would not be surprised to learn that as well.\u00a0\u00a0The liver is so important, does so many thousands of processes in the body, when it is not working right, nothing works right, not even the brain.I know that there are many extra hepatic symptoms that many doctors do not put together until our livers are cirrhotic.I hope you can get some help, perhaps your doctors would all work together to make a plan to help you.I wish you the best, please keep in touch.Dee",
