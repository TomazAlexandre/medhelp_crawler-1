            "answer": "If the spinal cord problem is more extensive, including the lower spinal cord roots in the sacral region and lower on down in a region called the cauda equina - then yes it can explain many of your symptoms, especially the worsening of symptoms with exertion.\u00a0\u00a0However, it would be important to make sure there is not a vascular problem (meaning clogged arteries in the lower abdomen and legs) that's causing all of these symptoms as that can often mimic neurological diseases.Spinal stenosis at the levels that you mention typically do NOT cause abdominal symptoms, and the pain is a sharp, pins and needles, radiating type of pain from the back to the legs. Talk to your primary care doc about the symptoms (don't forget the abdominal pain which can be an important clue) so that you can be properly worked up from the vascular standpoint. This is especially important if you have cardiovascular risk factors like tobacco use, high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease. Also consider seeing a neurologist and getting a formal exam and EMG to help localize the problem. Best of luck.",

    "question": "I have been diagnosed as having spinal stenosis, moderate to severe L2-L3, moderate L3-L4, severe L4-L5. I have no sensation of having to urinate, terrible lower abdominal cramping and pain in my knees and legs in general which is made worse when walking. I am on the following medications for these symptoms: Ativam and Neurontin . The medications help alieviate the pain for a period of 4-5 hours but effect the way my head feels. Are the symptoms and spinal diagnosis related?",
