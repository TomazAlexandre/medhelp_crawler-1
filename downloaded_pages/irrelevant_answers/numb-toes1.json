            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, follow caregiver\u2019s advice and get your blood sugar assessed along with glycosylated hemoglobin to assess the diabetes status. Another possibility to be seriously considered is a pinched nerve at L5-S1 level. This can be done by nerve conduction study and a MRI. Though less likely chances of Tarsal tunnel syndrome should be considered if other causes are ruled out.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Wow! I had no idea so many people had issues with numb toes...I\"ve been experiencing the same prblem in only my left foot. Two biggest toes and part of my foot...Its scary.. I'm getting it looked at in two days, which to me seems like an awfully long time since its been constantly numb for the two or three days and reoccurring numbness for maybe over a month. The last weekend though I really noticed it. I went snowboarding, and there was a long drive there and back so that could be it I guess, but its still numb. So my next guess is that my boot bindings were too tight and\u00a0\u00a0was in cold weather... But I don't know.. We'll see what the doctor says and I re-post...But I must say thanks to all the other posters. Reading up on other's people's similar problems makes me feel better. Like it may not be as serious as I think. I just don't want to have diabetes or loose any limbs.NE ways have a good one everybody... I hope all your guy's symptems clear up.",
