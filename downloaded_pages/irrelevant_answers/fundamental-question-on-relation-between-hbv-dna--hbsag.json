But when its integrated into the cell its far more difficult.Hep b is uncredibly complex",

            "answer": "If you have cccDNA in the nucleus of an infected cell, then m(messener)RNAs all the viral proteins (HBsAg, HBeAg, HBcAg, X protein) and pgRNA are constantly transcribed using cccDNA as the template. The viral proteins(including pgRNA) mRNAs move outside the nucleus into the cytoplasm to be translated into the actual proteins:gene -transcription-->mRNA- translation --> protein.However the pgRNA is reverse transcribed to HBV DNA (inside the capsid made up of core(HBcAg) protein. The NA antivirals inhibit reverse transcription of pgRNA, therefore no HBVDNA being formed inside the core protein capsid, therefore no HBVDNA made and released into the blood. On the other hand, the translation of viral proteins mRNA carry on as usual, making a lot HBsAg protein - these are then released into the blood as SVP(sub viral particle) and as the coat of core capsids with no HBVDNA inside.So the reasoning is that under NA treatment, no(or minimal) HBVDNA will be detected, but HBsAg will still be detected , in the blood, therefore qHBsAg is a surrogate marker for cccDNA quantity.Under natural immune control and no treatment, both HBsAg and HBVDNA should be good indicators of cccDNA quantity.",

            "answer": "It is not the virus that causes damage, it is our own immune system that causes the damage when it tries to attack and kill infected liver cells.Virus continues to replicate if cccDNA continues to exist inside infected liver cells. Antiviral drugs inhibits the formation of hbvdna from cccDNA, but do not affect cccDNA. Yes, continual replication from cccDNA and continual inhibition to form new virions by antiviral drugs.Hbvdna is never released directly into the blood from infected liver cells. HBvdna is always enclosed inside the new virions. When we measure hbvdna in the blood, we actually measure the hbvdna inside the virion (the capsid of the virion is lysed first to extract the hbvdna inside, which is then amplified and measured by PCR).Checking for hbvdna count is to check how many virions are produced (how active the disease).It seems outside Immune Tolerance, a high amount of virions (hbdna) in the blood will lead to inflammation and immune reaction - these constant inflammations and immune reactions(that do not lead to a complete clearance of the infection) cause liver cells damage and fibrosis over a long period of time.",

            "answer": "You don't have to have HBV to have HCC. Very broadly speaking, cancer is caused by an accumulation of genetic mutations/changes. It is a multi-step process. Viral infection can cause damage to the genome, just like smoking and radiation and host of other factors. Damage can also be caused by mutation in our genome during cell divisions. There are also oncogenes and gene like BRAC1, BRAC2, P53 etc.In the case of HCC, hbv infection and cirrhosis are important risk factors.Many of us will die of cancer, the best we can do is to minimize the risks.",
