I am high risk due to 4 miscarriages with my daughter being the only survivor and she is 8. I also have a past of seizures and blood cloting disorder. I am now 21 weeks and happy to say because the docs have been taking such good care of me that this is the healthiest pregnancy I have had.",

They will have to stitch it up around 17 weeks and could put me on bedrest. I also have had 2 miscarriages in the past year. I go every 2 weeks right now and get an ultrasound every time. I like that I get to see my Dr so often and see the baby, it helps calm my anxiety and fears that something is wrong. My DR's nurse also calls once a week to check in in between appointments.",
