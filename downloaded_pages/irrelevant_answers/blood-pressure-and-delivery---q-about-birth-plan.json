            "answer": "I know they monitor you closely during your pregnancy if you have high BP.\u00a0\u00a0 However, I never heard that this was an indication for a c-section.\u00a0\u00a0 If your blood pressure were high at around the time of delivery for some reason and you were in danger during delivery , they'd probaby do a c-section.\u00a0\u00a0 however, asthmas, diabetes, and/or HP don't automatically mean c-section.\u00a0\u00a0 Esp if controlled.I had preeclamsia with my pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0My BP was slightly elevated, however, it wasn't the plan for c-section.\u00a0\u00a0 We planned for vaginal delivery.Basically you will know if you have a c-section closer to your delivery date.\u00a0\u00a0 But it's not automatic indication for c-section.\u00a0\u00a0 The other problem is you are probably at risk for pre-eclampsia because of your high blood pressure. But only time will tell if that will be a problem for you.....Here's a good link from march of dimes.\u00a0\u00a0I hope it helps.http://www.marchofdimes.com/professionals/14332_1222.asp",

            "answer": "Thanks for the info.I was reading some information about pe last night and its almost the opposite to what I thought. It seemed to be what you said, it's\u00a0\u00a0more likely they'd want you to do vaginal delivery because a c-section maybe be worse for blood pressure issues.Yikes.",

            "answer": "I have high blood pressure controlled by meds before and during my pg.\u00a0\u00a0I also had gestational diabetes with my first 2 pg (not with this last one for some reason)\u00a0\u00a0But I had a totally normal delivery\u00a0\u00a0Even more I had a VBAC with no problems... they did monitor the baby more because of the VBAC but it was all fine and my blood pressure was fine... just keep it under control during pg with your meds and exercise (walking) because if it gets out of control it can cause growth issues with your baby",

    "question": "Hello,I'm just 4wks and 5 days pg but a question I've always wondered about is if they treat expectant mothers differently for delivery if you have a history of high blood pressure, it is controlled with drugs before ttc and during ttc.A.If your bp is controlled during pregnancy (no probs) do you have just as much chance of them letting you deliver vaginally, no intervention or do they not want to test our blood pressure issues that much?? and automatically from week eight they start talking c-section?B.Your bp is not in good control during pregnancy do you automatically have a c-section around your due date? Or if there's that much problem controlling the bp do they have to take the baby as early as they can but when it's past 26 weeks.?For some reason I always thought that with my medical history (high bp, pre-diabetic, asthma) there was not a chance in heck they would want me to try a natural delivery, I always thought it would be a planned c-section but now I realize that I don't have any real basis for that thought and I don't see my Doctor til Friday so I wondered if you ladies had any insight.ThanksThanks for reading,",
