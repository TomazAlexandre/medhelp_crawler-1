            "answer": "Hi,'Abnormal nerve sensations such as pins-and-needles, tingling, burning, prickling or similar feelings are all known as \"paresthesias\". Some cases are severe enough to be considered painful. Paresthesias usually result from nerve damage due to pressure, entrapment, or nerve diseases. Continued nerve damage can lead to finger numbness and permanent loss of feeling. Any abnormal sensation needs medical investigation.Distinction as to which fingers are tingling is important to diagnosis. The main fingers are more likely to be affected by conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome. The 4th and 5th fingers are affected by the ulnar nerve, which can be interrupted by pressure at the elbow or the chest area (e.g. thoracid outlet syndrome).Parethesias in the hands and fingers can also be caused by broader diseases such as peripheral neuropathy (more common in the feet but hands can be affected) and various others. Correct diagnosis of the causes of finger paresthesias is important and treatment can often reverse the damage.

    "question": "I'm a 31 year old female. I have pins and needles/numbness/tingling/buzzing/pin ***** sensations in my feet several times a day, without any obvious cause, such as my circulation being restricted.Sometimes the sensations occur when sitting, sometimes when I have been standing still for a while (on the train) and then start to walk again. Occasionally I have the same sensations in my hands, but it is mostly in my feet. Pin ***** sensations also occur all over my body most days.I would really appreciate any advice.Thanks in advance, M",
