    "question": "I've been having a problem with my sense of smell for the past 9 months or so. I could be doing nothing in particular and all of a sudden I'll smell a very strong floral scent that reminds me mostly of a perfume. It happens almost every day. It usually lasts somewhere between 5 minutes to an hour, and it is always the same smell. It also usually causes a sweet taste in my mouth. I haven't had any known infections or illnesses in over a year. For the past month it has also started to occur after I have a large sneeze. Any ideas on what could be causing this?",
