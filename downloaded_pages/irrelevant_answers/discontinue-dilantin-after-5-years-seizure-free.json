            "answer": "Hi thereStat wise this is what I can offer you: about 4% of people will have a seizure during their lifetime. There is a 30-40% chance of it happening again but with treatment that chance is halved. Usually though doctors will only prescribe medication if a person has had more than one seizure, I don't know if maybe they thought because of his age they would stick to the safe side and prescribe it for him.Whatever he does, he should not go off the medication without speaking to his neuro first. If the neuro agrees then he can wean himself off the medication to see if he is seizure free without it.Take care",
