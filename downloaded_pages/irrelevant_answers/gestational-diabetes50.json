            "answer": "Yes I have it I'm 31 weeks pregnant. It's not bad at all its just they put you on insulin you have to see a nutritionist and they give you a meal plan. It's ok I thought it was the end of the world but it's ok. It made me drop a lot of weight tho and its a good and bad thing because my experience I had to go to the hospital because me and babies heart rate was above 200 and this was after I took my insulin. Not saying it will happen to you just be careful. Just eat healthy and watch carb intake you will be fine :)",

            "answer": "I had it with my last pregnancy, I'm taking the 3 hr test again in 2 weeks to see if I got it again. The good part about it was I didn't end up gaining a lot of weight because I was on a strict diet. You just have to eat smaller frequent meals with only one serving of carbs at each one and it also helps to walk 15 min after each meal. Luckily I controlled the GD with my diet so I was never on insulin shots. I did have to poke my finger 5 times a day and keep a log of my blood sugar for the doctor. I'm sure if you kept a good diet you and baby will be just fine!",
