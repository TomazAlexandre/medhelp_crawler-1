But it's not as simple as the chart may appear. Your target LDL number can vary, depending on your underlying risk of heart disease.Most people should aim for an LDL level below 130 mg/dL. If you have other risk factors for heart disease, your target LDL may be below 100 mg/dL. If you're at very high risk of heart disease, you may need to aim for an LDL level below 70 mg/dL.So who's considered very high risk? You might be if you've had a heart attack or if you have diabetes. In addition, two or more of the following risk factors might also place you in the very high risk group:SmokingHigh blood pressureLow HDL cholesterolFamily history of early heart diseaseAge older than 45 if you're a man, or older than 55 if you're a womanCopy and pasted from Mayo Clinic site.",

Some would say that LDL is not relevant, it's the percentage of small, dense LDL that matters. Some would say that ApoB matters more, or that CRP (inflammation) is more important.Target levels are being revised downward lately.Roughly half of those who get heart attacks have normal cholesterol values.

LDL is not directly measured in today\u2019s routine lipid panels. Rather, it is calculated using the Friedewald equation: [LDL] = [total cholesterol] \u2013 [HDL] \u2013 [triglycerides/5]. Thus, calculated LDL is falsely low in patients with elevated triglycerides, and it does not correlate well in patients with diabetes, coronary disease, or other atherosclerotic diseases.",
