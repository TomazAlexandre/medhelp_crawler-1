    "question": "So my 54 year old mother might be possible going blind. She already lost vision in her left eye a few years ago and we fear the same is happening in her right. She had central retinal vein occlusion in her left eye already. For the last couple weeks she has been seeing yellow spots and having increased blurriness in her right eye. She doesn't have diabetes but she has toxoplasmosis which we discovered just a few years ago when these problems started. We are limited by the doctors to choose from down here in florida and I wanted to know if anyone has any experience in this matter. She also suffers from migraine headaches, PAD, osteoperosis, e.t.c. the eye surgeon she saw today said he wants to wait till Friday to make a decision. He did laser surgery on her eyes a few years ago and it did absolutely nothing. She obviously is having hemmorhging again and we wants to do it again but is waiting till Friday to get more info.",
