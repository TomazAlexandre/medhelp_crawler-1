            "answer": "What kind of pituitary tumor? There are many kinds, and there are many medications.If the tumor does not respond to meds, you can try another med, or if it fails to respond, yes, surgery is an option.Mind you, please know that surgery does have risks - and with it, you may end up having to take different medications for the rest of your life. Your tumor is large and you could end up hypopituitary or panhypopituitary so have to take growth hormone (injections), thyroid, estrogen, testosterone, etc. etc.Is your endo a neuro-endocrinologist?Any size pituitary lesion can be removed - actually if it gets to be too large, it gets difficult. An experienced surgeon is a must. That minimizes your risks.",

            "answer": "No, you should not risk it growing any more.You need to find an endo that specializes in pituitary tumors - typically, they do not treat diabetes (some do, not often). They are usually in universities, or larger hospitals.You are risking blindness and the loss of other hormones just by it growing. There is more risk in letting it grow, IMHO, than in surgery.Hypopituitary is the loss of one or more pituitary hormone, panhypopituitary is the loss of almost all of them or all. It just depends of the degree of replacements one must take.",

            "answer": "My son had same tumor and please before surgery try STERIOTACTIC RADIATION it is the least invasive form of treatment if the tumor is not calsified.\u00a0\u00a0The surgery will change your life forever and it is a hard road to go down.\u00a0\u00a0If only we had the radiation option back then,\u00a0\u00a0Good luck",

            "answer": "Radiation is an option. Your tumor is usually treated with meds first, surgery second, with radiation last.Radiation is usually reserved for last as while you are not technically cut, which is good, it can take up to 6 months to 5 years for the radiation to take effect. It can also have unintended effects on the pituitary and depending on the size and placement of the tumor, a person can lose one of more other hormones and have to take replacements. There is also a slight risk of damage to surrounding tissues from the radiation.There are different kinds of radiation - gamma knife, cyber knife, proton beam and they are all slightly different and should be researched, as well the facility you use should be familiar with pituitary tumors as placement of the beam(s) is critical as there is some radiation leakage of a few millimeters to surrounding tissues and they have to make sure they are not hitting an optic nerve or your carotid.It is an option and sometimes the only option for some people. It is usually not the first option however due to the risk to the rest of the pituitary though.",
