            "answer": "Sorry to hear about your symptoms, glad workup did not show anything serious. Double vision that is present with one eye closed is usually (but not 100%) a problem of the eye itself rather than the brain.\u00a0\u00a0COnsider a formal eye exam by a neuro-ophthalmologist especially if pain and visual symptoms worsen.As for the rest of the symptoms, consider getting a B12 level check as a deficiency can cause both eye problems and numbness/tingling. Rheumatological problems like lupus are also a possibility as well as thyroid disorders. These can be evaluated with blood testing.\u00a0\u00a0FInally, for further evaluation of the sensory problems, an EMG of the limbs may help further evaluate this. Talk to your docs to see what your next step should be. GOod luck",

I have had all the tests and am on several drugs to keep it balanced, but if no-one has a diagnosis, we don't know how long I will stay functioning.just wanted to let you know that several people have this \"disease\" that doesn't have a name,,, you don't have to suffer alone, (which is probable not that comforting but it gives me a bit of relief to know that other people are experiencing these symtoms)wendy",

            "answer": "Dear Wendy and Graham,Thanks for your reply! On purpose, I did not mention all symptoms. Among those I didn't mention: Light flashes or slow dimming light at night when eyes closed. Nausea, cold shiver, sleeping arms at night. Numb fingers and toes. Muscle spasm and -twitches. Affected coordination (gate). Burning sensation on tip of the tongue. Painful shoulders; feels like bones sticking out of skin. Flickering image, especially when looking at monitor. Sleeping disorder. Sensitive to light. Pain behind eyes.Sometimes, my vision is so obscured that my brain can not see all details at once. I first have to scan the image before the brain can compose the entire image. Missing moving objects. I fail to see a car coming from the side.Mild burning back and stiffness of entire body. Head feels like 1000kg!These symptoms are not continuous. Maybe I still forgot to mention some. It is actually hard to describe sensations that are not normal.I agree many have similar symptoms but the trigger is unique! I have never read about people having this and I am sure doctors believe I am a lunatic if I tell them that an aggrevation is triggered by just lifting 5oo gramm!I noticed that most triggers are pulsative. For example, holding a hard material in my hand and touching another hard material. Or, a fork suddenly comming loose from a banana (sudden drop of resistance).It is all weird, scary and devastating. I have to think about everything I do to avoid aggrevation.I did see several psychologists and shrinks. Some believe it's mental, some don't.Oh yeah, I am an 34 year old male from Amsterdam.Regards,Rody",

            "answer": "Hi Rody,Having read the additional info you put on I can understand why this is so alarming to you. The visual effects are very strange and as you say, the trigger points are like nothing I have heard before.I hope the neurologist here can maybe put some sense to it, I would not have a clue.Keep your chin up, I really hope you manage to get to the bottom of this problem or at least find someone who can improve your condition.Best of luckGraham",

            "answer": "Hi Rody! I am very sorry to hear how much pain you are experiencing.:o(I can only hope it is nothing too serious. I have been living with undiagnosed symptoms for 3 years now. Well I also have epilepsy and have been \"living with\" the Relaps/Remitting episodes of the numbness and tingling and pins and needles and spacticity and such. I have just recently PUSHED to have more aggressive tests done to find out what is going on with me. The doctors have been saying it was my seizures but, (long story) it is not.I read the post following your first one and I felt badly for you and all your suffering. Just because the tests that have been performed haven't come up with an \"official\" diagnoses doesn't mean your suffering is any less real.:o)Hope your have some remission soon....or better yet....GET well!Heart",

    "question": "Since 4 years, I suffer from many neuro symptoms like tingling in hands and feet, burning feet, spikes & needles, dizziness, tinitus, after images, heat wave image, visual snow, double vision, painful eyes, fatigue etc. Several MRIs and spinal tap ruled out MS (confirmed by 3 neurologists). Lyme disease, diabetes, eye problems (VEP OK, visual field OK) ruled out too! Tingling and visual disturbances are present non-stop! Aggrevation is triggered by lifting anything heavier than a pound, opening a door, someone \"hitting\" me mildly. A trigger is even produced when my finger removes a piece of skin fom my skull (dandruff) or when a neurologist rubs my feet with a needle!! I can walk hours without problem. The symptoms (first symptoms only tingling and double vision) first showed up after heavy fitness exercise, almost vanished after 9 months but reappeared after too heavy exercise again. When aggrevation triggered now, short burning sensation on chest, burning feet, dizziness etc. Double vision (also with one eye closed)by the brain, not the eyes! Don't see two seperate identical objects but images do not perfectly overlap. Especially the trigger is weird!! What can this be?? CNSV?? Thanks in advance!!!",
