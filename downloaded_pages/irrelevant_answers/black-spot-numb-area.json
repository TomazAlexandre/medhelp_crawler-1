    "question": "On the tip of my left big toe is a black spot under the skin and the area around the spot is numb. I can press my left big toe to the floor and I feel nothing, just in that small area there is nothing to feel. Oh, and the toenail, along with the right big toenail, suffer toenail fungus that just won't go away (have had since 1999). I see my general doctor on Tuesday of this week, what questions should I bring to her attention in regards to my left big toe?",
