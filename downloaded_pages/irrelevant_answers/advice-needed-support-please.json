    "question": "ok so I got diagnosed with a mild case of\u00a0\u00a0polyhydramnios. Doctor did more testing for gestational diabetes and other lab work. I barely passed my 3-hour so she is treating me as a diabetic and basically said that's why I have too much fluid. Yesterday my doctor called me and told me she was reviewing my ultrasound and she noticed that babies femurs are measuring short. She said that is associated with Down's syndrome but also seen in a lot of Hispanics. So now I have to see a specialist for a level 2 ultrasound. She told me not to worry about it at all but she doesn't want to ignore anything. Has this happened with anyone else and had a healthy baby and a healthy delivery?? I'm so nervous. This is my 3rd baby with my first 2 being perfectly healthy baby girls.",
