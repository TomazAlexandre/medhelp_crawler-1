            "answer": "Hi Maria, welcome to the Diabetes Type 2 forum on MedHelp. It sounds from your results that you don't have diabetes, but there are other tests, such as the A1C. You are normally supposed to fast before most of these blood tests for diabetes.http://www.medhelp.org/diabetes/articles/All-About-the-A1C/1766",

    "question": "Hi all, I went to an endocrinologist today bcause i think i have diabetes.. She did a random blood sugar test and the result was 78.. I know this is normal but i am worried it is not accurate because i got tested at around 6pm and the last time i ate was around 6:30 am, i just ate 2 loaves of wheat bread. Is it the reason why my reading was normal and therefore not a good sign if i really am diabetic or not?",
