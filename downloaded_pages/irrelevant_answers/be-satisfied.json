            "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your results. Unfortunately ANYTHING can be 'normal' for hep c. It is a sneaky, anfractuous, unscrupulous reptile, just as you said. And it spits fire on top of all that.I know you might have decided not to treat at them moment, but if I was you, I would definitely not postpone treatment. You do not want to end up in a situation where you cannot treat and will need a new liver.... and then have to do tx after that too. And then, we are not getting younger... The risk of postponing tx is a loss of ca 2% of possibility to be cured per year. And you are just a year past the magic number.I'm sorry I'm butting in on the treatment issue. Am just concerned.Marcia",

Got out of bed one morning and decided to get some blue superman pills. Found out had diabetes put on Glipizide. Developed high level of anxiety that doc attributed to suger spikes and rx'd Celexa. All right with the world and everywhere else. Follow up blood tests showed raised liver levels. Just got back biopsy pathology report. I'm 1b, grade 2/4, stage 3/4 with bridging fibosis. Liver measures 21cm. Kidney enlarged to 15.6cm. Gallbladder contains multiple hyperchoic densities with polyps. Spleen enlarged to 17.8 and is homogeneous.
