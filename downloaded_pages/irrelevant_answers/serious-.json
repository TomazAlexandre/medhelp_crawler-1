            "answer": "All that means is that your uterus is measuring 30cm. It could be the position baby was lying, you could have an excessive amount of fluid or baby could just be bigger than average. I wouldn't stress out too much about it. Measuring the bump with a tape is never accurate. It's just a guesstimate.If you continue to measure 4 weeks bigger your Dr is likely to order another ultrasound just to check baby's growth and development. Also if you have gestational diabetes that can cause you to have a bigger baby. If you haven't had the test yet it is probably worth asking your Dr about it",

            "answer": "The tape is just a way the Dr tries to determine if ur growing properly without having to do ultrasounds at every appointment. Since babies grow at diff rates then its possible to measure bigger or smaller than ur estimated due date. Just BC it measures you at 30 does not mean ur now 30 instead of 26. If you continue to measure bigger they may do an ultrasound to check in on baby but even that won't change how far along u are necessarily if u are measuring 4 wks bigger by then.",
