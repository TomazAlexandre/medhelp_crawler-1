I found that most ear, nose and throat doctors don't have a clue when it comes to these types of neuro conditions.\u00a0\u00a0I feel for you and know exactly what you are going through.\u00a0\u00a0This can cause problems with balance, memory, sensitivity to noises and light - the list goes on and on.\u00a0\u00a0One thing that seemed to help me for a while was a compound drug called betahistine.\u00a0\u00a0It might be worth a try.\u00a0\u00a0After you've dealt with this for so long you get to the point where you will try just about anything to get rid of the spins, nausea, headaches, etc., etc., Good luck to you.",

    "question": "I have been suffering from constant vertigo for almost six weeks now.\u00a0\u00a0I have gone to see an ENT and all my inner ear tests are normal.\u00a0\u00a0I have gone to see a neurologist and tests for MS, ALS, diabetes, Lyme disease, and syphilis have all come back negative.\u00a0\u00a0The neurologist said it would probably go away on its own, but it is not improving at all.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried antivert, valium, and the Transderm Scop patch to treat it.\u00a0\u00a0The patch helped for a while, but in the past few days seems to have stopped working.\u00a0\u00a0Also in the last few days I have had upset stomach, gas, and mild diarrhea.\u00a0\u00a0I have been drinking pedialite and gatorade to treat dehydration if that's what it is/prevent dehydration.\u00a0\u00a0I am completely at my wits end - I can't work or drive or function or do anything but lie down and not move my head or focus on anything.\u00a0\u00a0Please help!",
