            "answer": "Do not assume that you have symptoms of type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Type 1 diabetics produce no insulin.With Type 2 diabetes, the pancreas produces insulin, but this may be not enough, or it produces enough but your body has become resistant.The symptoms you have mentioned could be glucose intolerance or Type 2\u00a0\u00a0diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The only way to find out is to book an Urgent appointment to see your doctor and tell him your symptoms.The HbA1C blood test shows the percentage of glucose that is in your body over a period of 9-12 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0This is because the glucose sticks to the red corpuscles and they are renewed every 9-12 weeks.Your doctor may order you to have the HbA1C blood test, or may order for you to have a glucose test.Because you are not able to control your urine and going to have to urinate a lot, this can be a symptom of diabetes, but also a urinary tract infection.Make sure that you eat a healthy and well balanced diet with lots of fibre, vegetables, fruit with skin on, porridge, Wheetabix or Shredded Wheat, lean meat and fish.\u00a0\u00a0Cut out or cut down on all sugary foods, processed foods, cakes, biscuits, white bread, fizzy drinks, alcohol, fruit juices and squashes.Have a healthy snack a few hours after a meal.\u00a0\u00a0A healthy snack can be a piece of fruit, a natural yogurt, a handful of nuts.This will help to stabilize your sugar levels so that you do not have slumps.Do NOT use your friends blood sugar monitor.\u00a0\u00a0These are fine, but they only give you a reading of your blood sugar at the time of taking the finger prick test.\u00a0\u00a0It does not give a whole picture of what is going on.As you have experienced problems with your vision, make an appointment to get your eyes checked out.\u00a0\u00a0Ask if they do diabetic screening.\u00a0\u00a0This is important.\u00a0\u00a0This type of screening will be able to see if you have any damage.\u00a0\u00a0You do not say where you live.\u00a0\u00a0In the UK, if you are found to have diabetes, your doctor will arrange for you to have your eyes screened once a year.Book an URGENT appointment to see your doctor to get a proper assessment and diagnosis.Let me know how you get on.",

    "question": "So in the past month I've developed a lot of the signs of type 1 diabetes. Headaches, stomach pain, dizziness, vision changes, fruity breath, tingling in feet, drinking lost of water, peeing a lot, wetting the bed/not making it to public restrooms in time, constant tiredness no matter how much sleep I get, tightness in chest. I went to the ER two nights ago and they said nothing's wrong but it keeps getting worse. I'm wondering if I should get tested again by my primary DR. My girlfriends cousin has Type 1 and has told me the way I've been feeling in between my meals is how he feels when he's low. Is it possible that I'm starting to get diabetes but it's not showing up on test yet?",
