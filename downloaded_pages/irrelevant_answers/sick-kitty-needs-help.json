            "answer": "I don't think it is diabetes, cause chem analysis of blood test came out ok, plus it usually effects hind legs(sit on haunches) I think. but thank you. He usually does drink and pee a lot all the time. He loves to play in his water bowl( and shower). I think he has bengal mixed in by markings and personality.He has been on the clavamox for several day. He seemed to be in pain, but buprenex seems to be helping.\u00a0\u00a0He was lethargic, but attributed that to pain, since he has been more active with pain killers. He was still able to climb onto couch and down. He favored one front paw.\u00a0\u00a0Now he is showing signs of ataxia. He has trouble controlling his front paws and walking.\u00a0\u00a0He has been eating, except for today.\u00a0\u00a0I gave him an appetite stimulant today.\u00a0\u00a0He has been urinating, but has not had a bowel movement yet in past few days. Temperature was fine, but wbc was a little elevated(reason for clavamox).\u00a0\u00a0He as been on crate rest since friday. He was walking around then, but not well. I tried to get him out of the crate for supervised time, but he wasn't interested.I am going to ask tomorrow for a steroid in case it is ivdd.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know why they didn't give him one before if they suspect that ivdd was a possibility.\u00a0\u00a0If he doesn't show improvement within the next few days, I will most likely have to put him to sleep. I am trying to stay positive and hoping it doesn't come down to worst case scenario.",

How's your cat's heart-murmurs, enlarged?\u00a0\u00a0What about the breathing?\u00a0\u00a0Did you give him any new medications at home or could he have gotten into something?\u00a0\u00a0What about the kidney function-BUN and creatinine levels?\u00a0\u00a0Kidney problems can cause weakness as well.\u00a0\u00a0You can also ask for a copy of the chem test to see if somethng might be off-maybe the vet overlooked something.\u00a0\u00a0You could do your own research on the internet.I can understand the frustration-GOD knows I've been through this with my cats, too!Please, keep trying to post this on the Ask A Vet forums and I can't stress to you enough to put Dr. Aleda's name in the subject line.\u00a0\u00a0She is awesome!Wishing ya well!\u00a0\u00a0Give your kitty a chin rub for me!",

    "question": "I have an awsome cat that is very sick. I may have to put him to sleep within the week becuase my vet can't find the problem. Thought I would see if any vets in the forum may be able to help.I have an 11 year old cat named Hunter.\u00a0\u00a0Last two weeks he has been eating less(rare for him) and lost 3 of his 16 pounds. He became very lethargic and was favoring one front paw. I took him to my vet. They did blood work but everything came out normal except an elevated wbc(didn't say how elevated). They did an x-ray(digital imaging). They x-ray his abdominal area(seemed tender upon palpatation early on, but not so much now) and neck area. The vets consulted with other vets working there and found nothing. They don't know what is wrong with him.He is eating better(without appetite stimulant, hard to get him to take pills) but is showing signs of what appears to be ataxia in front legs. He has lost coordination and strength in front paws, so he has trouble walking. It started out favoring one paw, but now affects both paws with having trouble even moving one leg. Originally they gave him metacam one dose a day for three days. Currently he is on reduced dose of metacam once every 3 days, and buprenex 2x daily. He is also on clavamox 2x daily to try to address whatever is elevating his wbc. He is on crate rest to reduce movement and further aggrevation of whatever may be causing the problem.Currently think it could be Intervertebral disc protusion in the neck, but that is rare and he hasn't suffered any trauma that I am aware of(indoor cat). I already spent $400 that I couldn't afford to find problem and don't have money to hospitalize him. May be able to borrow money from parents, but need to have an idea what to test for.If anyone has any ideas or thought on a dianosis. Thanks in advance.",
