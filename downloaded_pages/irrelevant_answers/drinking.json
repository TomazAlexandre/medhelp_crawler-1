            "answer": "My 16 year old cat went through a phase of climbing over my head whilst i was in bed to drink my glass of water that i have beside my bed every night. I was very worried that she might be dehydrated because of this behaviour and took her to the vets. The vet\u00a0\u00a0did lots of tests and\u00a0\u00a0fortunately found nothing wrong with her. She continued to drink the water out of any cup/glass of water that belonged to me or my husband. In the end i put one of our cups full of fresh water on the floor just for her daily and now she drinks from that and doesn't even try to drink from our cups!Yes she is a spoilt cat!!I would still take your cat to the vets just to check her over, its always best to be safe than sorry.",

            "answer": "when its not excessive drinking it shouldn't be much to worry over(just reread your post). sometimes kitties prefer standing water because by sitting the chlorine has evaporated and they enjoy the taste more...plus no more offensive smell to their sensitive noses. never hurts to get it checked out tho to be sure.",

            "answer": "Hi there!!\u00a0\u00a0If it isn't normal for your cat to be so obsessive about water I would get some blood tests done just for your own peace of mind.\u00a0\u00a0My cat recently started going from water bowl to water bowl to water bowl frantically drinking and urinating a lot more than normal.\u00a0\u00a0This could be a sign of diabetes like the other posters suggested.\u00a0\u00a0It could also be a sign that he/she is having kidney problems like my Jixxa was diagnosed with and if it occurs with other symptoms like increased appetite, weight loss, and hyperactive behavior it could be a sign of a thyroid problem.\u00a0\u00a0All of these conditions are serious but if caught early can be treated to prolong your kitty's life and make him more comfortable too!!\u00a0\u00a0;-)\u00a0\u00a0Hope that it turns out to be nothing more than odd behavior!!\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!!",
