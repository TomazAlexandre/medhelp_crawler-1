    "question": "Five yrs ago I had a partial thyroidectomy after my blood work, Doppler test and biopsy came back positive for thyroid cancer. Since only the left died was removed, I was not put on any kind of meds.My PCP now can feel something on my remaining thyroid. She ordered only a TSH test and the result was 058She says no reason yo worry...she will check it again in 3 months.I feel since I have all my old symptoms (and new one...pre-diabetes) she should have done more. Should I request a referral to an endocrinologist??Thanks!",
