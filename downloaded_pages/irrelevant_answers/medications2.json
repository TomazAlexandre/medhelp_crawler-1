            "answer": "Sounds like you have a lot of medical things going on, which always makes life even more complicatd for someone with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I am not a doctor and your questions really should be addressed to a physiscian familiar with all of these issues and your particular health history.\u00a0\u00a0Finding the right medications and the right combination of medications can be a little tricky.\u00a0\u00a0These are not matters to be trusted to your friendly volunteer or even someone you know with similar issues.\u00a0\u00a0So, my only advice is to go back to your physician or if you are not comfortable with the advice you are getting, get asecond opinion.As far as the caffeine and Nutrasweet issue goes, you might want to try a natural sweetener called Stevia. You can get it in health food stores and it is all natural and not made from any chemicals.\u00a0\u00a0The only problem I have had with it is that it dissolves better in hot or warm drinks than in cold drinks.\u00a0\u00a0If caffeine raises your blood sugar, you might want to try some of the flavored herbal teas.\u00a0\u00a0There are so many varieties and flavors and with the Stevia, you could still have that sweet treat without raising your blood sugar. I really like the Raspberry herbal tea and it is especially good iced.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

            "answer": "Hi Jeannies,Another volunteer, non-physician here.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a long time Type 1 diabetic.If you're not being followed by an endocrinologist for your diabetes, I'd recommend that you ask for a referral to one.\u00a0\u00a0Endos specialize in our disease (among others) and will be able to help evaluate your meds.\u00a0\u00a0You seem to be on top of your \"numbers\" and that's terrific.\u00a0\u00a0Bring those numbers along with you to your appointment and tell the doc that you'd like to have better numbers -- be as specific as you can.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps s/he will recommend diet or exercise changes in addition to all that you're doing.Another sweetener that's not artificial is Splenda.\u00a0\u00a0It's an variation of a sugar molecule, and unlike Sweet 'n' Lo and Nutrasweet, it has nothing fake in it.\u00a0\u00a0That's available all supermarkets and large drug stores, Walmart, etc.In the warmer weather, I've \"discovered\" the joys of iced decaf.\u00a0\u00a0I recently gave up caffeine due to the spike I could no longer pretend didn't happen.\u00a0\u00a0;-)\u00a0\u00a0Some of the herbal teas are a real treat, too.\u00a0\u00a0When all the \"can't do this 'n' that\" starts to get you down, try to shift your focus to all that you CAN do and all that you ARE doing to keep yourself as healthy as can be.\u00a0\u00a0That might lift your spirits a bit.Hope this has been helpful.",
