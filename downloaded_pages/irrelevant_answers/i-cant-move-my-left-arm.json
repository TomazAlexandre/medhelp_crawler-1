    "question": "I am a 36 yr old male with a history of hypertension,insulin dependant diabetes,sleep apnea,Hyperlipidemia,acute chronic pancreatitus and degenerative disk disease(currently flairing up in lumber reigon. Heres my problem; two weeks ago monday i woke up with a extremely stiff neck and neck pain. Over the course of the week the pain progressed down my left shoulder almost to the tip of my elbow. I can move my hand, elbow and fingers are fine but i cant lift my arm straight out straight back or out sideways. Basically no shoulder movement at all. it just wont move. I can move my arm with my other hand and the pian stays the same. i've just had a cspine xray and cspine mri which are both negative. I just had an mri of the left shoulder but results are'nt back yet. my neuro and ortho are both stumped and im tired of loss of that arm and the pain.todd",
