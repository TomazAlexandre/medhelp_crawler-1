            "answer": "Yes you are right. Blood sugar can definitly be affected when thyroid levels are off. You are hypothyroid with TSH of\u00a0\u00a08.5 and so many symptoms. You more than likely need an increase in thyroid hormone but need to have the actual thyroid levels checked before to know for sure. FREE t3 and FREE t4. Good luck and God bless!",

Yes the doctor gave me a higher dose.My hair is falling out everywhere.\u00a0\u00a0I have a theory.\u00a0\u00a0I stopped all fish oil and vitamins because I think the thyroid slows everything down. I think I can't process the vitamins. The rash on the back of my hands is better after stopping the fish oil.\u00a0\u00a0I think it was all backing up in my liver and causing toxicity to the liver.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe this is why my Creatine was so high. Anyway, this really *****.",

    "question": "I have had a thyroid problem for about 13 years. I took meds for it and it was fine. I am now 45 years old.\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly, I am losing hair like in hand fulls.\u00a0\u00a0I went to doctor and my thyroid level was about 8.5.\u00a0\u00a0I never gained weight. I have always been normal weight, and I wasn't really tired. My doctor is nagging me about my blood sugar which was 102. I am a health nut and hardly eat sugar or bad carbs.\u00a0\u00a0I am about 128 pounds\u00a0\u00a0and 5 feet 2 inches. Due to the nagging, I have cut out almost every carbs. My weight went down to 125 pounds. My thyroid was 6.9 in last check and blood sugar 100 My creatinine was high normal.. The doctor is calling me prediabetic because people are supposed to have low sugar with hypothyroid. I don't have a family history of diabetes except for an uncle.\u00a0\u00a0He had a high sugar diet,and he was sedentary but was normal weight. He was about 50 when he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I am a Caucasian.This is turning me into a nervous wreck.\u00a0\u00a0I can't lose any more weight without looking awful and I can't change my diet. I already exercise. I think the doctor should lay off the blood sugar tests until she gets my thyroid down, and waits a few months. Am I right?",
