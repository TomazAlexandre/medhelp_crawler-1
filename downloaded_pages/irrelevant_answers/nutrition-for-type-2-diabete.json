    "question": "Facts:\u00a0\u00a0Elderly (76)- my mother-in-law, recovered from breast cancer (mastectomy performed) in 1995; later diagnosed with Type 2 diabete (1997); then diagnosed with chronic Hep B (2000) - treated and is still on medication.Current condition:\u00a0\u00a0Fragile, underweight (5ft 3in, weighs under 90 lb). Eating very little, avoiding chicken altogether (myth about its toxicity), but eating congee (porridge made with white rice)every morning.\u00a0\u00a0No exercise at all whatsover.\u00a0\u00a0She is confined to her apartment because she believes (and others in the family agree) that she is \"too weak\" to do any exercise.Questions:\u00a0\u00a0I am thinking of sending her some multivitamins, but not sure if there is any particular vitamin/mineral that she should avoid in terms of her diabetic and/or HepB condition.\u00a0\u00a0I am aware that if you have some sort of heart problem, you should avoid iron.\u00a0\u00a0If there is anything I should watch out for, or anything that is particular important for her to have?\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestion?\u00a0\u00a0Also, is oatmeal porridge a better choice for breakfast?\u00a0\u00a0I would think white rice porridge is not good because it is so starchy and would rapidly increase her blood glucose (since it is not in solid form and would be digested easily).",
