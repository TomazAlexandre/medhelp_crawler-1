            "answer": "Your first stop should be a good eye doctor. Eye exams can pick up a lot of things.Second, your doctor did not run enough tests to rule anything in or out but the most common pit tumor, prolactin, was normal. However, there are lots of other hormones to be tested.As for soon, well, you want quality of life, so yes, I would rather get to see someone sooner rather than later. You may want to see an endo - but absent any testing, it may be hard to get in. Pituitary tumors are treated by a neuro-endo. Your gyne needs to be sharp and test you well so you have the ammo to get further.",

            "answer": "Thank you for the help. I did call the gyne's office and they wanted to work me in this week. Hopefully they will be thorough and test well to figure out what is going on. I will make plans to see the eye doctor as well. Does a neuro-endo usually hang out at a neuro's office or an endo's office?",

            "answer": "They usually hang out at a university. They usually do not have diabetes as part of the office name, but they can. But they are a separate specialty. Most endos that one sees treats diabetes and thyroid (and that, huh... well, not so well at times).",

            "answer": "Went to the gyne and he is recommending a D&C due to the thick lining on my uterus from lack of menstruating. Apparently he believes I am not ovulating more than once or twice a year. Will have to be on hormones indefinitely after the surgery to continue to have a period. The surgery is scheduled for later this month.Went to the ophthalmologist and almost failed my field of vision test on the one eye. Found out my vision has changed and my glasses apparently aren't correct. Weird thing is, my glasses are too strong now from what she said. She then looked in my eyes and saw swelling in the optic nerve in both eyes. Took pictures with the machine and saw optic nerve swelling in both eyes as well on there. She has set me up to see a neuro-ophthalmologist but their first available isn't until the end of August.I am concerned about this swelling and wondering if I should be looking around for someone who will see me sooner. I am having symptoms along with the optic nerve swelling and she said that was the biggest reason she is referring me. I want to really see the doctor she is referring me to though because of the hospital they are affiliated with.Anyway.. I am nervous now about my vision and a lot of possibilities that could be going on. Have you had this symptom?",

            "answer": "I have visual field deficits as well but my nerves are fine.There are benefits to keeping to a group of doctors so they can talk - but yeah, that is a long time to wait... but not sure if you have other options. Unless something drastic is going on though, it should be safe enough to wait - but if you have a drastic change, contact your doctor.",

    "question": "I went to my doctor complaining of amenorrhea, (absence of menstruation). This has been going on for years on and off. Well symptoms have gotten increasingly worse. I now get blurry vision all the time and it feels like I am looking cross-eyed most times. I am always really thirsty and have a lack of appetite with weight gain. I get headaches even with treatment for migraines. I am tired all the time. I get numbness and tingling in my face and I get dizziness. There are a few more symptoms as well. I went complaining of some of that to the primary doctor and she checked blood work including some hormones like FSH and LH and Prolactin all of which were normal. My TSH was normal as well. I had a pap done but that was normal. She did not however test my testosterone level but I don't know what other hormones other than estrogen that she did not test.She has referred me to a gynecologist because of the amenorrhea. I am really confused and I am wondering if this is the proper doctor for me to go to. From all my research it sounds like a pituitary problem which would best be handled by an endocrinologist? Am I right about that?Also has anyone experienced these symptoms had a pituitary/brain tumor? Would those hormones coming back normal like they did mean something else is going on or do I need more hormone tests done in your opinion? Is this something I need to take care of very soon?I cannot STAND this blurry/double vision anymore. It has me really worried and this morning I woke up to a bloody\u00a0\u00a0nose. Not a real bad gushing one but a bloody nose followed by some dizziness later and nausea even later than that in the morning. Normally my nose just runs clear all the time.Am I right to be worried?Thanks ahead for your opinions.Thanks for any opinions you all can give.",
