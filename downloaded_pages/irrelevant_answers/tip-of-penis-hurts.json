            "answer": "Hi,Are there other signs and symptoms present? The most common symptoms of yeast infection in male are irritation, itching, redness and soreness of the head of the penis. Aside from being infected by your partner, prolonged antibiotic use or having diabetes could lead to this condition. Avoid irritation and antifungal drugs such as ketoconazole could help, but if your condition persists, it would be best to see your doctor for proper evaluation and management. Take care and keep us posted.",

    "question": "The very tip of my penis randomly started hurting and became very sensitive. This happened after I arrived home from the beach. It is slightly red and hurts when it rubs against my boxers. It has been a day since this started and it only hurts when something brushes against it. No pain on urination. I am not sexually active nor had a masturbated within a close period of the event. Thanks for any help.",
