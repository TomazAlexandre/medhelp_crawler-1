            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Chronic eye static may be due to the electrical activity inside our eye. This produces an image of the vitreous and retina, sometimes white spots against black or vice versa and sometimes red hues too. This is normal. Rarely this is due to inflammation. Most floaters never completely disappear. There is no medicine or eye drop that can really cure this.However floaters in the eye are a sign of retinal detachment, ophthalmic migraine, a blow or fall on the head or due to some inflammation. Please consult an eye specialist for this.Decrease in tears, dryness of eye, conjunctivitis, palpebral edema, stye, lacrimal sac infection etc can all cause blurry vision.It can also be \u2018eye\u2019 aura of a migraine. As you can see I have enumerated several possibilities. It is difficult to comment on net. Please consult an eye specialist for this and do not ignore this.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I had sparkly zigzags going across both eyes yesterday whilst drivng. I did have a slight head ache but I think it was due to the fact that I cog a bit concerned. My vision became worse so stopped the car. I closed my eyes and I could still see them. I kept them closed for 5 mins and then they went away.\u00a0\u00a0I still felt a bit strange I was worried I was going to black out or fit or something.\u00a0\u00a0About a year ago I had a similar episode but the sparkles seemed to fill the whole of my eye apart from the centre.\u00a0\u00a0I am getting quite anxious in case I have a worrying condition.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to book an eye test but wondered if anyone can tell me what it might be.",
