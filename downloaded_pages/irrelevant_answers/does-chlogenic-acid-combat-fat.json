            "answer": "Chlorogenic acid is an ester found in the green coffee extract, potatoes, peach, and prunes. It cuts the discharge of blood sugar into the blood after having a meal and boosts the fat metabolism in the liver. Consequently, chlorogenic acid can regulate the blood glucose in diabetics, prevent diabetes mellitus, and lower your body weight.Chlorogenic acid raises the synthesis of adiponectin, a hormone, which is produced by fat tissues. This adiponectin suppresses fat tissue development and promotes energy expenditure, burning fat in the human body. The amalgamation of adiponectin and leptin (a hormone secreted by fat tissues) helps increase insulin resistance.Chlorogenic acid acts as an antioxidant, and neutralises free radicals, which damage the cells in your body. In addition, it inhibits platelet cell aggregation (sticking together) and needless blood clot formation in the vessels. This process can lower the risk of heart disease, and stroke.It can lower triglyceride level in the blood, fat tissues, liver, and the heart. Chlorogenic acid also reduces the cholesterol level in the blood stream, fat tissues, and the heart.Green-Fu is surely an excellent product and you shouldn\u2019t hesitate to buy it now due to its endless benefits. Chlorogenic acid in green coffee is one of the most critical components in the product and you will certainly benefit a whole lot by consuming it on a regular basis.",
