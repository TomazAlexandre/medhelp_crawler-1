Went for my 3 hour test on a Monday morning and had lemonade and cake from my baby shower and passed. If you read any creditable gestational diabetes site, they will all tell you to eat like you normally do.

Not to trick the test up so you can pass, which won't happen anyways because you can't trick it. Not trying to be rude at all. I just get tired of seeing people posting about this and people leafing them to believe that they can find a way around it.",
