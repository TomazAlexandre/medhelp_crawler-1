            "answer": "Well, thay are not THAT good either. Your LDL or bad cholesterol is way too high and should be under 130 if you have no other risk factors for heart disease and under 100 if you have two or more risk factors. This has driven your total cholesterol too high as well. Your HDL and TGLS look good.You should discuss your treatment options with your doctor. You should make lifestyle changes and consider meds to help lower your LDL. Your ratio is good, but when I calculate your number it is 4..05.",

            "answer": "Hi Jon,Cholesterol levels are confusing me to say the least. I keep reading now that it's the smaller LDL lipids which are sticky and cause atherosclerosis. Reports I've read seem to suggest the larger LDL lipids are too big to get into the artery walls and are not sticky. If that's the case, then does the normal LDL level matter anymore?\u00a0\u00a0I think there are divided camps on this issue at the moment.",

            "answer": "There was one study that discovered the small \"sticky\" LDL which is the most dangerous of all LDL particles that have been identified, however it was only one study so there is still too much to learn. The particle size of LDL is less critical as the size of HDL particles. I asked my doctor about a particle size test when I did my last lipid profile and he told me that it really would not be something he would recommend as there is just not enough known yet.What is known is that the smaller \"sticky\" LDL particles are normally only found in those with diabetes and the elderly. It is created by adding certain sugar groups to the LDL which is a natural occuring event in those with diabetes and the elderly as our kidneys become less effective as we age. The process is called glycation.The smaller sticky LDL particle theory makes sense to me, I look forward to more research beaing done.",
