            "answer": "Hello,Thank you for your question. Was that blood sugar test done with you fasting? If so, then it is on the high side and should be repeated.\u00a0\u00a0 If you do have diabetes(or a milder case of abnormal glucose) it may be because of your weight. Dietary changes and exercise\u00a0\u00a0to help shed some pounds should help improve the glucose problem. It can be difficult dealing with many stresses at once, and often people do eat more than usual due to stress and depression. Perhaps you can also speak with your doctor about your anxiety and see if couselling can help too.Best of luck and take care of yourself.",
