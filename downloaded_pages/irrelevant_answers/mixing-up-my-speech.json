    "question": "I seem to be forgetting a lot of things at work these days and its starting to bother me. I was watching tv with my husband and a Toyota commercial was on and I told him I would like to go back to the Toyota dealer I bought my Toyota from and look for a new one. I have a Subaru and I got it from a Subaru dealer. If I'm looking at something brown and I'm speaking about something yellow i.e. a yellow flower.. I will say brown. Does this sound like I might need to see a doctor? I have diabetes (type 2) and I am only 45.",
