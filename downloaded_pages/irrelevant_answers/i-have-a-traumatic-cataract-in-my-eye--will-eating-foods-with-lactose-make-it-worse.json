            "answer": "Dear Dr. Hagan:Your qualifications are impressive and it is because of this that I would like to ask you more about lactose and its possible effects, if any, upon the eyes of a person like me, who is 72, and in excellent health, and who eats lots of raw veggies and their juices, as well as cooked veggies, whole grains, some meat, lots of organic whole soy products.\u00a0\u00a0I have always had excellent eyesight - but I have been diagnosed with cataracts by an eye specialist.\u00a0\u00a0The eye specialist has said that lactose makes the cataracts' effect upon my vision worse.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know who to believe.Thanks.Pat Merkel",

            "answer": "I don't think the answers are necessarily in conflict. However we're not talking about the same thing as lactose intolerance.Lots of things have been show to make cataracts worse: diabetes, obesity, any tobacco use, alcohol abuse, steroids, trauma to the eye, excessive sun exposure, radiation treatment through the eye, surgical vitrectomies, certain drugs, certain syndromes, heredity.Eating a lot of fructose or any sugar rich food can cause obesity and diabetes both of which are bad for cataracts.I don't think this is a \"one of you is wrong\" situation.JCH MD",

    "question": "I have also heard that Cataracts can get worse only for people with Lactose Intolerance. Although, I am of Japanese decent, I do not think I am Lactose Intolerant. My mother and father are not lactose intolerant. However, I am only 21 years old and I've heard lactose intolerance develops later on in life.",
