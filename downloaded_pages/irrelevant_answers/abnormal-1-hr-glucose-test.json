He vent done the 3 hrs test yet but I have talked to several expecting moms and they said they failed the one hour but everything was fine with the three hour test. From the reading I have done, if you are diagnosed with gestational diabetes this early, chances are high that you were already diabetic since gestational diabetes begins 20-24 weeks into pregnancy. (That is based on the websites I read from.)",
