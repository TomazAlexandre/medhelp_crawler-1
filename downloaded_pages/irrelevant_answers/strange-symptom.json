            "answer": "Your body has been handling a lot the last months with your treatment and all.I have done some research a while back and aspartame is neurotoxic, with some people more sensitive than others.\u00a0\u00a0This means it can damage your nerves.\u00a0\u00a0With your body being highly stressed with treatment and recovery you could be more than usually sensitive.Don't suspect MS.\u00a0\u00a0I would think other things going on.\u00a0\u00a0Look for the simplest explanations first.\u00a0\u00a0MS is not a simple explanation.Cut out aspartame.\u00a0\u00a0Stop chewing your gum.\u00a0\u00a0Or if you must chew gum, chew the regular full sugar type.\u00a0\u00a0The same goes for soft drinks and 'low calorie' foods.\u00a0\u00a0Steer clear.\u00a0\u00a0Eat regular sugar regular fat products.Second, make sure your doctor has cleared you for things like diabetes, which can also go undetected for a long time and can cause peripheral neuropathy symptoms.Focus on healthy as possible diet based on minimally processed foods.\u00a0\u00a0Stay as active as you can.\u00a0\u00a0For the sore spots, I would recommend trying massage from a qualified therapist.\u00a0\u00a0Appropriate regular exercise could also help these.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this response helps.Sally",

            "answer": "Oh, and please ask your doctor to test you for B-vitamin levels.Do the testing before you start taking supplements, as supplements can skew test results.\u00a0\u00a0If your levels are borderline you will need to take prescription dose B-vitamins (I take a B1, B6, B12 supplement 3x a day) or if they are low B12 injections may be given.If B-vits testing is ok, go for a good quality higher dose b-vit supplement and see if it helps anyway.\u00a0\u00a0B vitamins are water soluble and won't cause harm even in higher doses.Sally",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with seminoma in January 2004. From then I received 4 cycles of BEP, and after recurrence in mediastinum - 4 cycles of BEP and radiation to my abdomen and chest. Shortly after chemotherapy in 2004 I developed peripheral neuropathy which subsided after a few months. Similarily, after radiation I had L'Hermitte symptom for 2 or 3 months. Since the completion of treatment I have had also prostatitis which seems to be healed at the moment. Sometimes I am tired at the end of the day and I have tender points in my body occassionally. Three days ago I felt some prickling(tingling?) in my both feet as if something was crawling in bottoms of my feet. When I go to bed and wake up in the morning, I have no sensation of tingling. As the day goes on, this tingling comes back and it is sensed during sitting or standing. It seems to go off during fast walking. It is not intense but it occupies my mind. I have also some tender points in my blades, near my knees and in my buttocks. I started to take Lecithin to supply some B vitamines. I wonder what is going on with this crawling feeling? Is it fibromyalgia, some deficiencies of minerals, MS or peripheral neuropathy? I chew gum every day, about one pack daily in average therefore I wonder whether there is any relation to aspartame.",
