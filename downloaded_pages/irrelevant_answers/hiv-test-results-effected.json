    "question": "Hi, and thanks for a great and informational forum.\u00a0\u00a0I had a exposure risk nine months ago...one time, and my partner claimed they were HIV negative.\u00a0\u00a0It was anonymous and unprotected, however.\u00a0\u00a0After several months of waiting, and processing what I thought were symptoms, I was tested (eight months and 2 weeks after the exposure risk...so well beyond the window period).\u00a0\u00a0It was an oral test, the quick response kind.\u00a0\u00a0The results were negative. However, at the time, I was taking cipro for an intestinal infection, and flonase (corticosteroid inhalant) for a sinus infection.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I regularly take glucophage and lisinopril for diabetes type 2.\u00a0\u00a0I have been concerned that perhaps those medications may have caused a false negative.\u00a0\u00a0Can I rely on the results of that oral test, or should I\u00a0\u00a0be retested?\u00a0\u00a0My anxiety on this approaches unbearable.\u00a0\u00a0Again, thanks for your help.",
