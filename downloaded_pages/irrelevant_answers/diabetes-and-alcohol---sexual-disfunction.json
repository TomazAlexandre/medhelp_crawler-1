            "answer": "Dear sadler,Thank you for reaching out to JDRF. If your boyfriend is taking pills for diabetes he probably has type 2 diabetes. I would be interested in knowing his age and when he was diagnosed. Is he seeing a diabetes specialist?Alcohol is never a good thing with diabetes and in my opinion, as a volunteer only, it can affect his ability to detect low blood sugars. Also if he has problems with sensitivity with any parts of his body, it could be neuropathy. This is a complication of both type 1 and 2 diabetes. It is damage to the nerves. It also can result in sexual disfunction for the same reason.I would highly encourage him to speak to his physician about your concerns. I hope he is monitoring his blood sugars and taking his pills on a regular basis. Control is so very important with diabetes.There are ways to help sexual disfunction that he can take to his doctor about, certain rx's, but I would probably be more concerned with his alcohol intake.Please keep in touch as there will probably be a few posts on this question with more answers.Best of Luck,dm",

    "question": "This is a two part question.My boyfriend has diabetes, and I am quite concerned with his alcohol consumption.\u00a0\u00a0He drinks in the vacinity of two cases of beer a week!!\u00a0\u00a0I would like to find out some information on what dangers if any there is.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure what type of diabetes he has, although I do know that he takes tablets before his meals.My other concern is sexual disfunction.\u00a0\u00a0He indicates that the reason for this is his diabetes causing sensitivity to extremes of some of his body parts..toes...fingers...penis, although I believe it is, but think that if he was not consuming so much alcohol that this can be remedied.\u00a0\u00a0Is this true?Thank you for your help",
