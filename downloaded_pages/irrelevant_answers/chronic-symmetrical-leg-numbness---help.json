            "answer": "Study up on diabetes, it can cause circulation problems in the legs and feet.\u00a0\u00a0Until you said that, I was getting ready to tell you that poor circulation from too much weight can make your legs feel numb and stiff like that, but so can damage to the spine.\u00a0\u00a0I'm both overweight and have a serious back injury, my legs are all goofed up, stiff, limping, some neuropathy, and just the other day both my feet got numb.\u00a0\u00a0But if you've got diabetes, you are in luck, if such a thing can be characterized as lucky, because it can be controlled by managing insulin levels in the body.\u00a0\u00a0Do as your diabetic doctor tells you, and you'll be okay.\u00a0\u00a0As for exercising again to lose some weight, you can do all sorts of exercise without putting too much pressure on your legs and spine, like swimming is an excellent sport for someone whose legs can't take the banging around that running does.\u00a0\u00a0Really, anything that will cause you to break a sweat will help you lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0Also, if you can manage to get a good exercise programme going again, and you do lose weight, SOMEtimes that will take care of diabetes, to where it won't be a health issue for you anymore.",

    "question": "I'm a 32 year old male.\u00a0\u00a0Ever since I starting a running routine a few years ago (which I stopped not long after), I have had chronic leg burning sensations, it feels neurologic, and I assume it has something to do with my lower back since it affects both legs equally.\u00a0\u00a0I don't run anymore, but I still feel it when I sitting at my desk; my legs just kind of burn and have a cold sensation.\u00a0\u00a0When I run, I will usually run fine but then I will suffer for several days intense burning/cold down both legs and particulary strong at the knees.\u00a0\u00a0Needless to stay, I don't run anymore.\u00a0\u00a0 I am guessing a nerve is being pinched or something, and I am also guessing that week abdominal muscles might not be helping.I am frustrated because I want to lose some wieght but running which I love is very painful for me.\u00a0\u00a0I also feel like my legs are stiff when I walk, like they don't bend as much as they should or there is just odd leg stiffness.What can I do? Do I need to just suffer through it while I build my core muscles?\u00a0\u00a0MRI and other tests all been negative, except for a congenital pars defect, but I was not told that this condition is to blame.\u00a0\u00a0Can I just continue to run despite these issues?",
