    "question": "Hi,It has been brought to my attention from more than one individual that drinking \"Alkaline Water\" has a huge effect on cancer patients, in that \"cancer cells\" thrive in a acidic environment, and therefore cannot survive in an alkaline environment.\u00a0\u00a0Not only that but apparently drinking this water has alot of other health benefits, These \"Alkaline Machines\" are available from many distributors, (surf the net for more info).\u00a0\u00a0I do know of an individual who is a breast cancer survivor who is drinking up to 4 litres of this water a day and because the machine is hooked on to her faucet, she has offered to let me try some for a week or so, and I have noticed a difference in the way that I feel as well.This system was developed by Dr. Otto Heinrich Warburg, who claims that \"Cancerous tissues are acidic, whereas healthy tissues are alkaline, water splits into H+ and OH-ions, if there is an access of H+, it is acidic; if there is an access of OH-ions, then it is alkaline\".In short, his theory is that cells that have sufficient oxygen do not become cancerous, while cells that are insufficient in oxygen will become cancerous.\u00a0\u00a0High acidity in the system means that your body (cells) is not receiving sufficient oxygen while increasing the alkaline level will ensure that your cells are receiving the required levels of oxygen.This is simply for your information and if interested, please do some research as I found it to be quite interesting and for me personally made alot of sense.If anyone else has heard of this I would be interested to know your thoughts on it.Good Luck!",
