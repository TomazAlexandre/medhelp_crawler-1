            "answer": "Hi!Generally a high ANA titre indicates an autoimmune disease (SLE, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, scleroderma, polymyositis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, dermatomyositis). Depending on the pattern of ANA staining, other antibody tests will have to be done.Bloated abdomen can be due to IBS or spastic colon, Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/ Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, diabetes, food intolerance, malabsorption syndromes, constipation, gallbladder and liver problems, pancreatic dysfunction, or taking a diet rich in sulfites. Cancers of the gut and in female ovarian cancer too could be a cause. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Since you have a high ANA chances of IBS or spastic colon, Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/ Crohn\u2019s disease are high. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi everyone,I'm a 21 year old female who is currently being tested for celiac disease or IBS, but prior to these upcoming bloodtests for celiac, I had blood work done because on and off for the past year i've been experiencing severe fatigue, muscle ache, muscle weakness, irritability, difficulty concentrating, waking up as if I havent gotten enough sleep. I had a positive ANA last year but it was from strep that turned into rheumatic fever in addition to mono. Now i have similar symptoms from last year but do not have strep or mono currently. I now have intestinal symptoms such as constipation and diarrhea intermittenly, abdominal cramping if i eat something very starchy, loss of appetite,gas, bloating, and the worst of all severe abdominal distension for almost three weeks now. Please help, thanks",
