            "answer": "I dunno the answer to that.I should think that the liver heals itself and you could probably - logically - have as many biopsies as needed.However - uhm.... you might have medical issues that would forbid or cause problems with that.I don't really know. Someone much more prolific on the board will need to answer that question.Meki",

            "answer": "the alternative test fibroScan should be available in many places next year. fibroscan is a non-invasive test and you could have it done as often as you want. not sure if this is good to detect fatty liver but if you google it you will find alot of info about it. also there is some type of a mri test that will be to asess liver damage. best of luck.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed in 1993 with HCV based on positive surface antigens, high ANA, hypothyroid, vitiligo, inconclusive RIBA, negative liver biopsy, absolutely normal healthy liver no inflammation--PCR test not available and never ran on me, I moved and switched hepatologists and not all records were transferred.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I actually have AI disease and went through interferon with AI disease, which was horrible. I've had four liver biopsies since 1993, one prior IFN, one post IFN, one years later diagnosing NAFLD due to continued high lfts, and one a few years ago showing severe steatosis.\u00a0\u00a0Members of my family have died young from liver disease and diabetes and I'm following the same course.\u00a0\u00a0How many biopsies can a person get?\u00a0\u00a0If this continues and progresses and I may have need to determine if I have fibrosis, I understand an ultrasound is not good for this.\u00a0\u00a0I'm afraid to think of putting another hole in my liver.\u00a0\u00a0How many biopsies can a person get and are there other tests that can be done if I get really sick to determine the state of my liver?\u00a0\u00a0It used to be just ALT high, now for years the others are going up too.\u00a0\u00a0Metformin is helping lower them at times and I feel better, but not affecting the progression in my father or me.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for any help you can give",
