            "answer": "Type 1 diabetes in children usually comes on very quickly with consistently high numbers, so it is, indeed, puzzling. Was she on any kind of medication recently that could account for sudden rise in blood sugar? At any rate, an appointment with a pediatric endo is the way to go. I'm sure they told you if her numbers get high again and she experiences flu-like symptoms and vomiting to bring her to the ER. Best of luck to you and let us know how it goes.",

    "question": "Hi there,My daughter had a lethargic/almost unresponsive period two days ago, in which we took her in to the doc right away.\u00a0\u00a0After doing lots of blood work, her blood sugars were 334.\u00a0\u00a0We immediately were admitted to the hospital where her blood sugars then were 60.\u00a0\u00a0The docs were baffled with this low number.\u00a0\u00a0Within a few hours it was back up to 225, with glucose\u00a0\u00a0and ketos found in her urine.\u00a0\u00a0They kept her overnight and monitored her levels, which were consistentley in the 130's.\u00a0\u00a0We were able to come home yesterday and continue to monitor her blood suagrs at home which are still in the upper 130's.\u00a0\u00a0We do have an appt. with a ped. endo. but just wondering what could be going on.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be very early onset of Type 1 diabetes?Thank you!",
