            "answer": "Hi,There is quite alot of research right now into the genetic susceptibility for Type 2 diabetes and what we know is that there are many genes involved, not just one or two like some other diseases where you can test for it early on. I do not think anyone is using the genetic tests for Type 2 just yet because they are not specific enough. but there IS a familial tendency for type 2 even outside of obesity. There is also ethnic differences that influence what\u00a0\u00a0is \"overweight\" and puts you at risk for diabetes. lastly on the thyroid issue, if you have a low thyroid this tends to encourage weight gain and thus puts you at risk for type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It also afects metabolism overall. Hope this answers your questions! Take care,Anita Ramsetty,MD",

    "question": "Hi. I was curious about that state of reseacrh on Type 2 and just how much of it is genetic susceptibility? My mother and two of her sisters have/had (sisters passed away one from cancer one from the diabetes complications that she was constanly hospitalized for) type 2 though none of them is/was overweight and two were not particurlarly sedentary. Is there a propensity for some people to develop type 2 even if they are otherwise fit and healthy? Does hypothyroidism ( common in the family) play a rolel of any kind in the development of type 2?",
