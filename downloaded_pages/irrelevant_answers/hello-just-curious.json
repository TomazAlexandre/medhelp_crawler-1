            "answer": "Sounds like you need a complete workup, with blood labs, uranalysis, etc. by a good doctor.I have diabetes, and no doctor has mentioned a correlation between hypo/hyper/ thyroid and diabetes, but I'm sure it's possible to have both at the same time. A fasting blood glucose test or A1C test would give you good results. Stop worrying, and get thee to your doctor, you definitely need help, whatever your end result. Good luck.",

    "question": "Hello:I am SEVERLY HYPOTHYROID and cannot get stabilized in the last 8 yrs.\u00a0\u00a0I was pre-diabetic before I had gastric bypass surgery in 2004.\u00a0\u00a0In the past 1 1/2 yrs I have been seemingly getting worse.\u00a0\u00a0I have severe hot flashes, abnormal weight gain (30 lbs in the last 3 months), dry mouth, SEVERE vaginal itch, stabbing pain in the bottom of my feet and heart palps (just went to the doc and he said my heart was skipping beats).\u00a0\u00a0The doc cannot figure out why my TSH is high (which indicates HYPOthyroid, which I have been for the last 15 yrs) and my T3 and T4 are low (indicative of Hyperthyroid).\u00a0\u00a0Could it be diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0The doc never even suggested it, but, I am beginning to wonder.\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound familiar to anyone?\u00a0\u00a0Is this something I should bring up to the doc to maybe check?\u00a0\u00a0I really would appreciate any input as I am at my wit's end here.",
