            "answer": "Metforymin is generic Glucophage.\u00a0\u00a0I've not heard or read anything that says that in this case the brand name is better.Of all the oral diabeteis drugs I would prefer to be on Glucophage/metformin because it is the one that best addresses the main problem in Type II Diabetes - insulin resistance.Quix",

            "answer": "I started Metformin about 5 days ago, now that my glucose has risen to diabetic levels again.\u00a0\u00a0I enjoyed a \"diabetic free\" period for almost 7 months.\u00a0\u00a0I use to be an insulin diabetic along with oral medication.\u00a0\u00a0I lost alot of weight and the diabetes went into remission.I have noticed since I started taking Metformin that I have intestinal upsets.\u00a0\u00a0About two hours after I take it, I have diarrhea.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't last long and the pharmacist says that should go away with continued treatment.\u00a0\u00a0I also have MS.\u00a0\u00a0It should not cause any changes in your MS course.Metformin is a better medication for me because it does not cause the highs and lows of some of the other medications.\u00a0\u00a0I am less likely to have a hypoglycemic episode and it even has the benefits of helping with my polycystic ovarian syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0A little weight loss is common with the drug also, which won't hurt me either.\u00a0\u00a0It can also help lower your LDL cholesterol and lower your triglycerides.Lets hope that the drug does all that it claims.\u00a0\u00a0It would be helpful to me in several ways.Heather",

            "answer": "Hi Heather,They say with metformin you should start on a lower than prescribed dose (ie. 1/2 or 1/4 tablet) for the first few days to get your tummy used to it.\u00a0\u00a0Building up slowly as your tummy adjusts over a period of days to weeks should eliminate the tummy problems.Metformin is good in that it doesn't cause hypoglycaemia.\u00a0\u00a0Is beleived to be one of the safest antidiabetic drugs...Was on metformin for ages for PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0Now am on nothing while I'm breastfeeding, but guess I'll be looking at metformin again later...",

I do like the idea of starting on 1/2 pill to get the tummy used to it.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe that will help me.I also have PCOS and the dark skin because of that.\u00a0\u00a0I'm hoping this will be a good treatment.Thank you, all for your input.\u00a0\u00a0I really appreciate you!!!!!",

I have never been told to stop metformin during these tests. I also take Novalog and Levemir. I am thinking it is causing some side effects. I have symptoms of lactic acidosis but some of those are things you have with MS also! None of my Drs have ever mentioned this as a problem.
