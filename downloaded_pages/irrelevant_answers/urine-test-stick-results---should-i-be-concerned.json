            "answer": "Hello,It is normal to find up to 3 and occasionally 5 leukocytes per high power field in a urine sample. Higher numbers indicate urinary infection. Ketones can be seen in starvation, malabsorption, frequent vomiting or diabetes mellitus. This test should not be solely relied on for diagnosis since it does not replace microscopic or urine culture examinations. You can increase your water and fluid intake. Evacuate your bladder completely when you want to pass urine. If your symptoms are persistent you may need to see a doctor. I sincerely hope it helps.Best luck and kind regards!",
