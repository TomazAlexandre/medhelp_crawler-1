            "answer": "I'm the wife of a T1 diabetic, 13 yrs. My husband is pretty good about not going low. There was a time when it was happening more frequently and I couldn't sleep through the night without checking on him. Sometimes waking him up. He changed his insulin and has been really good the last two years now. I can actually sleep through the night! If he does have a low at night, the next few nights I'm a bit cautious, but it goes away.I think it's just going to take time for your wife. She's scared for you and for herself. You need to keep up the consistent testing and snacks, eating on time. Knowing what types of events might cause a reaction. Keep the lines of communication open with her, as well. Don't try to hide things. Maybe if she sees you being responsible, she'll understand that you're really trying. Of course, I don't know your wife, I think it's just going to take time for her to trust you again.This isn't an easy position to be in, spouse of a T1. We worry like we would for a child, and it's not easy to switch back and forth in relationship like that. We have to work hard at this too.As for 'back to normal' depends on how severe the reaction. 15 mins for minor ones. If he has one while sleeping, sometimes he's not feeling well for a couple hours. Really depends on how you feel.Good luck, just keep on doing what you're doing!",

            "answer": "As for driving, it depends on how low you got, how LONG you were low, and of course how long it took for your sugar levels to normalize. I know first-hand how awful it feels to have a spouse not take you at your word when you say you are OK after a low, but really the proof is in the numbers. You might allay her fears by making sure your glucose levels are normal before you drive. You may feel OK if still a little low, but reaction times are going to be slow. It will take a period of time wherein you avoid serious lows in order for her to trust that you really ARE safe to drive.",

    "question": "Two years ago, my type I diabetes went way out of control, and I had wild swings and a difficulty in controlling it.\u00a0\u00a0Naturally, this frightened my wife.\u00a0\u00a0In the last six months, I've really refined my technique and am very reliable.\u00a0\u00a0But my wife is still jittery, and won't drive with me, even though I'm probably more reliable than most drivers on the road - monitor myself very carefully.\u00a0\u00a0If I have a low incident, what is a considered \"back to normal\" timetable, that she can believe in?\u00a0\u00a0All I want is her to have faith in me, and not make me feel like I'm a leper.",
