            "answer": "My heart goes out to you and your daughter.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like this is a very difficult and scary time for the whole family.\u00a0\u00a0I am not a doctor, but I was a child when my diabetes was diagnosed and I certainly understand the anger one feels, particularly during adolescence.\u00a0\u00a0Having an eating disorder\u00a0\u00a0certainly complicates an already complicated situation.\u00a0\u00a0Being a teenager who wants to look and be like everyone else adds to the complexity of this problem. Unfortuantely, many young girls feel the pressure of being thin, smart, beautiful and, for your daughter add, the perfect diabetic child (which she was for many years).First of all, give yourself some credit for being on top of things and getting your daughter into appropriate treatment for her eating disorder.\u00a0\u00a0You have not indicated whether your daughter has participated in any ongoing therapy or whether the family has had any family sessions to help you cope and find new ways of dealing with these very complicated issues.\u00a0\u00a0Many eating disorders programs will offer family sessions and support groups.\u00a0\u00a0But there is really no quick fix.\u00a0\u00a0There are some programs that are residential and longer term that might be appropriate for your daghter if the eating disorder continues.\u00a0\u00a0Bingeing can be part of an eating disorder and just as serious as anorexia, especially for a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0With both diabetes and eating disorders there are lots of feelings and emotions involved, so the usual ways of coping with diabetes...watching your diet, monitoring blood sugars, taking insulin, etc....are only the beginning.\u00a0\u00a0Without addressing the feelings, the usual methods often fall to the wayside.I would encourage you to talk with your physician and your daughter's school counselors about potential programs for her. There are probably other students who have had eating disorders and you may benefit from their experiences. Counselors and physicians will know of the best treatment centers and make a recommendation if they feel that she could benefit from longer term treatment. One advantage of residential treatment is that it will get you out of the day to day loop and place the responsibilty on your daughter which is ultimately where it lies.Both diabetes and eating disorders are lifelong challenges that, together, are more than most families can cope with, without some outside help.\u00a0\u00a0You will need to be involved in her treatment, but she will need to be responsible for her care and that is a hard balance to find for families just dealing with diabetes, let alone both of these conditions.Although I never had an eating disorder, I do know that as an angry teenager, therapy really made a differnce in my life, not only reducing my anger, but in reducing my fear, giving me hope and helping me to feel like I wanted to take care of myself.\u00a0\u00a0I only wish that someone would have recommended family therapy for my family at that time.\u00a0\u00a0It is almost 40 years since I was diagnosed and there are still some tough days, but I have learned that you don't need to be a perfect diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Being\u00a0\u00a0good enough and learning to like yourself, even when you hate your disease, can make all the difference.I know I have rambled and perhaps not given you a very useful answer, but I will encourage you to get some counseling help in addition to the medical help you are already getting---for all of you.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone out there has any more experience with eating disorders and diabetes, please write in.\u00a0\u00a0Please keep in touch and let us know how you're doing.ES",

            "answer": "I agree with ES that it's a good idea to consider family & individual therapy on an ongoing basis.\u00a0\u00a0It is *normal* for teens to rebel; I think it their \"job\" as part of growing up.\u00a0\u00a0Teens usually can zero in the the thing(s) that cause the most stress for their parents.\u00a0\u00a0It's easy for diabetic kids to know what to choose.Anger is often the root cause and it may be diabetes \"only\" or it may be a combination of things.\u00a0\u00a0Teen years are tumultuous and when someone looks at teen cross-ways, their emotions FLY!\u00a0\u00a0Your daughter may be stressing over \"being different,\" she may be stressing over family dynamics (job loss/change, moving, divorce, remarriage, loss of a friend, sexual issues [unwanted advances?\u00a0\u00a0lack of \"wanted\" advances? fears].\u00a0\u00a0There's plenty of stuff that teen girls wrestle with.Further, there may be issues within the family dynamics that feed into her anger & fear, even tho' the behaviors may be rooted in love & concern.My advice as a diabetic, a step-mom of a troubled teen, and the aunt of a diabetic 20ish girl who's not caring for herself well -- is to not give up.\u00a0\u00a0Ever. Ever. Ever.\u00a0\u00a0She may well give up on herself.\u00a0\u00a0She has & will test your patience, drive you to insomnia, and panic.\u00a0\u00a0Find a support system for yourself (family & individual counseling can help here) and hang on.One of the *best* support systems around is the local JDRF chapter and their network of families & resources.\u00a0\u00a0If you've not visited before, I'd encourage you to visit http://www.jdrf.org adn search for a chapter/branch near you.\u00a0\u00a0Further, on that site, if you click on the link labelled something like \"Newly Diagnosed?\u00a0\u00a0You're not Alone?\" you'll be brought to JDRF's Online Diabetes Support Team.\u00a0\u00a0It's **not** just for newly diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0Unlike this site, that forum is 1 on 1, electronically initially and, as you prefer, you can move to phone or in person interactions with someone in your area who has experience similar/relevant to yours.Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0It's harrowing.\u00a0\u00a0Your daughter is smart.\u00a0\u00a0She knows \"intellectually\" what's what.\u00a0\u00a0She's hurting emotionally/ psychologically & needs your strength & patience to continue shining a light in the right direction.",

            "answer": "I have been diabetic since I was 12, I am now a happy 40 year old married mother of two.I went through some mild bingeing (sp?) in my late teens as a diabetic, but this situation sounds far and beyond normal rebellion, and the sorting-out of regular self-hatred feelings associated with teenaged diabetics. My gut reaction is, you need a registered psychologist or psychiatrist here for some intensive work. Don't nag, but don't give up! Keep love first and foremost. Hang in there - we are all behind you. Also, maybe there is another diabetic out there who has faced the same problems, that you could hook her up with, either on the net or in person.Lesley",

    "question": "Our daughter was a model patient for 13 years.\u00a0\u00a0She is 16 now and has been admitted to an eating disorder program twice in the last 5 months for two weeks at a time.\u00a0\u00a0She has gained 30 pounds in that time period and binges on oreos, bags of candy bars, pop tarts.\u00a0\u00a0She has covered up the eating with more insulin.\u00a0\u00a0She never lied to us in 13 years.\u00a0\u00a0Now she lies all of the time about where she has been and what she has eaten.\u00a0\u00a0She is a good student and in general a good child.\u00a0\u00a0However the lies have taken a toll on our relationship.\u00a0\u00a0We have tried punishment.\u00a0\u00a0Taking away cell phone, car, groundings etc.\u00a0\u00a0We have tried a relaxed approach.\u00a0\u00a0Letting her work it out herself.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing seems to work.\u00a0\u00a0At the hospital they say she is angry at having diabetes and when we try to restrict her it just makes things worse.\u00a0\u00a0Other than that we don't feel she has gained a lot from the stays.\u00a0\u00a0We are about ready to bring her home and just let her alone.\u00a0\u00a0She has had all kinds of warnings about what she is doing to her body.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe we just need to let her find her own way.\u00a0\u00a0Just wondering if anyone else has been through this and what has worked for them?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
