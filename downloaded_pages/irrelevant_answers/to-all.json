            "answer": "I looked it up in my huge book and didn't see anything about potassium...\u00a0\u00a0It says:Tyrosine is important to overall metabolism. It is a precursor of adreniline and the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine, which regulate mood and stimualte metabolism and the nervous system. Tyrosine acts as a mood elevator; lack of adequate amounts of tyrosine leads to a deficiency of norepinephrine in the brain,which in turn can result in depression. It also acts as a mild antioxidant,suprresses the appetite, and helps to reduce body fat. It aids in the production of melanin and in functions of the adrenal,thyroid, and pitutary glands. It is also involved in the metabolism of the amino acid phenyalanine.Tyrosine attaches to iodine atoms to form active thyroid hormomes. Not surprisingly, low plasma levels of tyrosine have been associated with hypothyroidism. Symptoms of tyrosine deficiency can also include low blood pressure, low body temperature, and restless leg syndrome.Supplemental L-tyrosine has been used for stress reduction, and research suggests it may be helpful against chronic fatigue syndrome and narcolepsy. It has been used to help individuals suffering from anxiety, depression, low sex drive,allergies, and headaches as well as persons undergoing drug withdrawl especially cocaine withdrawl.Persona taking a MAO inhibitor must strictly limit their intake of foods containing tyrosine such as almonds, avocados, bananas, dairy products lima beans ans seseme seeds. and they should NOT take any supplements containing tyrosine. as it may lead to sudden rise in blood pressure.",
