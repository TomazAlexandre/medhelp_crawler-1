            "answer": "I had something similar happen to me when I was pregnant last year. I had cramping that was persistant for over an hour and it was mainly on one side. I went to ER and I wasn't contracting at all. They thought that I just over-did it and stretched my muscles too much. They actually found blood in my urine too and it was just because I had strained muscles. My son was born in December and he couldn't be healthier!! Maybe you just did what I did, hopefully.",

            "answer": "i have had the exact same thing happen to me during this pregnancy, i was also 31wks when i started having contractions, the only difference was i went to 2cm dialated and 75% efffaced when the doc checked me the first time, so i was flown out 5 hrs away from where i am for them to put what the call nitro patches on me, and they monitered me for a week. At 32wks i came home and thought i was fine but none the less 2 days later i was back in the hospital contracting, They put me on strict bed rest the only time i could get up was to pee. I have been in and out of the silly hospital since then and am now 37 wks. And am being induced on friday. I wouldnt worry too\u00a0\u00a0much because they will give you stuff to help the baby and make sure everything is okay with you and baby. If i were you just relax and dont push yourself. Take it easy and everything will be fine! Good luck",

            "answer": "Yes it happened with me. About the same time too. I was about 31 weeks and they checked me I was 3 cm and 90% effaced. They hooked me up to and I was contracting but nothing consistant so they sent me home. I delt with it for 3 weeks, until I had an ultrasound and found my water was low. They induced me, and I had my little girl july 3, 2008.Just be persistant with your doctor as well, Tell them about every little problem and get checked often to see if you are dialting.",

    "question": "This morning I rushed to ER-\u00a0\u00a0I had severe pain in my upper abdomen for 2hrs. My first thought was that it could be a gastric pain, but it was so persistent- then after 2hrs it was like on & off for a while. By the time I reached hospital, i had no pain. I was hooked on to monitor to find how i was contracting. They said I was contracting, but not that frequently. I was monitored for an hour, then Dr gave an injection to relax my uterus and 2 pills. They didnt want my uterus to contract bcause I'm only 31weeks now.\u00a0\u00a0Baby's HB looked normal.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. checked my cervix, and it was closed, after an hour again he checked - it was closed, so they weren't worried much. And prescribed brethine until 37weeks if i had pain.The thing is while i was contracting at hospital, I didnt feel contractions much- just little.Has this kind of pain(persistent pain)\u00a0\u00a0happened to anyone before?I'm worried if this pain would occur again.\u00a0\u00a0Should I stay bedrest?Some advices please.",
