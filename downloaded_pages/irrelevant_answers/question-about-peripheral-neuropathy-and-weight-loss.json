            "answer": "I went to the doctor and asked to see a neurologist, they didn't want to let me see one instead they told me they would treat me there. I was like what do you know about this disease he didn't know much but was quick to offer me Gabapentin. I told him If I had a bone sticking out of my arm what good would pain meds be in treating the symptom I want the bone fixed same thing with this I want to try and save the nerves.I have been looking over the internet and today got a lot of organic veggies in R-lipoic Acid that I see is given in Europe but not in usa I guess because they cant patent vitamins here. I will start working out tomorrow as my muscle tone has decreased especially in my legs. I want to try and to do the most I can, not to just avoid the pain but to regenerate the bad nerves if possible.I had bells palsy once and those nerves that had once paralyzed my face got corrected I'm hoping this will also do the trick especially if I lose weight now at 367. what do you think about this",
