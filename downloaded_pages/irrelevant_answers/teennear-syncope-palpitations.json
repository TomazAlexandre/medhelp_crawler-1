            "answer": "Hey,Of course, your heart racing more while you're anxious is very normal. Beinga teenager, it's tough to pinpoint why you are eating more and not gainingweight, but as the mother of two teenage boys, it also seems normal to me.If you would like to know more about the thyroid, look up thyroidpower.com,they have a lot of information. Do you have any other seemingly unrelatedsymptoms? For example, people with thyroid disorders often shed morehair than usual on a daily basis, fingernails can be brittle, and if it'shyperthyroid, you would feel jittery or shaky. How are you sleeping?Are you really tired even after a good night's sleep? These are a fewthings to consider when you see your doctor. And, no, I wouldn'tthink this is an urgent matter. Just ask your mother or father to set upan appointment and let the doctor know how you feel. It's always goodto get answers, at least this way you can reassure yourself that you aretaking steps. And maybe it's just teenage stuff. Being a teenager thesedays is REALLY hard. Let me know!",

            "answer": "I'm curious to know why someone your age knows what pre-syncope is in the first place. That is a medical term which most 13 year olds don't know how to even spell, let alone know what it is. Why haven't your parents been checking up on what is going on with you?",

            "answer": "Son, I'm not a doctor, but I am pursuing a degree in medicine. Many doctors and nurses will overlook heavy soda consumption because most are not familiar with the addictive nature of soda and the harmful effect it has on your body in regularly large quantities.You said you drink quite a bit of soda; soda has large, large amounts of sugar in it, about a handful per 20 oz bottle. If you are drinking more than 60 ounces of soda a day, your anxiety is almost certainly due to your caffeine intake. I used to drink a great deal of soda and almost nothing else, and when I quit, the post withdrawal relaxation was astonishing and unexpected. Caffeine dehydrates, if you're not drinking atleast half as much water as you're drinking soda, your near fainting spells are probably due to dehydration, the veins may be high blood pressure, as sugar spikes couple with caffeine and drive your blood pressure up, especially if you're losing weight. I'm afraid the weight loss may be a symptom of diabetes, as are all of these symptoms, and may be due to your sugar and caffeine intake.Your hunger is a result of the caffeine and sugar heavily effecting your metabolism, you may think weight gain when you think diabetes, but this isn't always the case. If your body becomes accustomed to burning insane amounts of sugar and has the help of caffeine to speed the process along, it will begin to burn whatever it can to stay in that routine.You seem like a very smart lad, I'm sure you can see that your heart palpitations may be a result of the dehydration and the caffeine.Consider this, and research diabetes. At this point in your life you have a very good chance of reversing it before or even after it takes place,Good luck.",
