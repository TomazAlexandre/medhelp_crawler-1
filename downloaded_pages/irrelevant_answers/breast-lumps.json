            "answer": "Hi,First thing: please have the lumps checked out by a physician as soon as possible.\u00a0\u00a0You need to have an examination and likely mammograms/ultrasounds to evaluate them. This is very important as they can be very serious and life threatening. Do not assume they are benign without a full examination, please.Diabetes itself does not cause breast lumps, so I do not think this is the cause.Some of the symptoms you describe can be due to diabetes but may be other things as well. You should have a fasting blood sugar level checked as your first screening to look for diabetes. If you do not want to see a physician, buy a glucometer and check it at home after atleast 8 hours of not eating or drinking anything but water. A value above 100 is not normal and should be evaluated.Good luck and take care.",

Always take a lump serious, get them removed asap.\u00a0\u00a0The longer they stay the more problematic they can become. Stay safe, get them removed immediately when they are less threatening.\u00a0\u00a0The longer they stay, the more serious they can become.\u00a0\u00a0I know, I lost a few friends who were told they were just cysts.\u00a0\u00a0If you weren't born with them, take them out, they are a signal to you that something is not right.\u00a0\u00a0Don't take chances with your life.\u00a0\u00a0Get them removed like a bad tooth.\u00a0\u00a0Very simple in office procedure, painless. Safe",
