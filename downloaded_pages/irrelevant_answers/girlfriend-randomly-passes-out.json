    "question": "My girlfriend is 17 and randomly passes out. She doesn't do drugs and doesn't take any medication. Sometimes right before she passes out she gets dizzy, but other times there is no warning at all. She said sometimes she has a slight pain in her chest after waking up. When she passes out she is only out for about 5 to 10 seconds before she gains consciousness again. Today when she passed out, i caught her, and she woke up and her head hurt... but she said it wasn't like a headache though and didn't feel like she hit it. We took her to the hospital about 2 months ago when it started and they ran tests. They said her heart is perfect. The cardiologist said the same thing. They claim that she is dehydrated, but she drinks alot of water. She passes out probably once or twice a week. Please tell me what you think it might be.",
