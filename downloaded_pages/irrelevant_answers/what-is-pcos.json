            "answer": "Hi , pcos\u00a0\u00a0or (polycystic ovary syndrome ) is where there are\u00a0\u00a0lots of tiny cysts on the ovaries , these cysts produce hormones and\u00a0\u00a0 can cause\u00a0\u00a0symptoms such as , absence of periods , increased hairiness , weight gain and insulin resistance which the latter if not controlled can lead to type 2 diabetes . Because of absence of periods it is harder to become pregnant . My friend has this condition and has managed to control the symptoms through diet and exercise and she now has two children . I hope this has been of some help , take care - Silver",

Maybe your symptoms are from stress.",
