Your GP can possibly recommend one.Speaking of GP, what do you mean by, \"I've tried to speak to the GP -- but because of issues of patient confidentiality, haven't made much headway.\" You're his spouse and by law have as much right to hear, see or obtain his medical records as he does. Write a certified letter to the GP requesting copies of your husbands medical record to be sent to your home address. Make a copy of the letter for your records too. There are places and agencies that can deal with stubborn doctors.Good luck.",

My husband has been on insulin since 2006 Easter and has spiralled steadily into depression (sees no hope; constantly tired; often has a death wish; sleeps long hours); he also goes into severe rage (can get verbally abusive) for little things.
