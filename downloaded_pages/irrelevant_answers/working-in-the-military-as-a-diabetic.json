            "answer": "My spouse is a military personnel officer, and I asked him this question, even though I think that I know the answer. He replied that because he is not a recruiter and has not been asked this question personally, he cannot state the answer without doubt. However, he suspects that the answer is still \"no\". The reason is that the military services are not interested in taking people with ANY kind of pre-existing medical condition, not only because of danger in a combat situation, but also because of the costs of medical care for the rest of that person's life.I do know that if a person is diagnosed as type 1 while active duty, he or she may be able to stay active duty IF his or her job does not require combat duty. Now this is true only in some cases, and in some branches of the military. I know some medical personnel (doctors) who have developed diabetes and who are active duty, while other people I know have been discharged from the service after being diagnosed. If a person develops diabetes when already in the military, it really depends on his or her job as far as whether he or she can stay on active duty.So, while we suspect that the answer is \"no\", the only way to be sure is to give your local recruiter a call. The recruiters would be the best people to answer this question. They are more than willing to talk with you, and they know all of the rules about eligibility.As for your second question, we cannot speculate at this point, for we really do not know what form a cure will take until it happens. At this point, there is research going on that involves trying to re-grow beta cells, and of course, this would be a true cure. In the meantime, there may be stop-gaps that come along that are partial cures or improvements to how we treat type 1 diabetes today, and of course we would accept these if they improved our health. We just have to wait and see what becomes available and how the military treats it when it happens. Let's hope it is soon.",

            "answer": "I know your not 100% sure, but thank you so much for such a quick respons and thorough answer. It is dissapointing that they are so discriminating against ANY medical condition. I do wonder if they take into conserderation your value to them however. I would in no way like to brag about myself, but I am very inteligent and I have been in all of the top Honors and A.P. classes in High School, so I wonder if my value to them could outweigh medical costs for diabeties. I can only hope, right? I will try to talk to a recruiter at some point to know for sure. Though what I have heard from here and other people makes me a little depressed. :(",

            "answer": "Ares, your intelligence DOES make you valuable. I have suggested this to other people who have written to us about military service, and I want to suggest it again... my spouse and I have been part of the Air Force for 26 years now, and I am amazed at how many jobs that used to be done by active duty personnel are now done by civilians. Any working base is made up of many more civilians than active duty. The civilians rise in rank as they progress just like the active duty folks, and I even knew one high-ranking civilian who was a Squadron Commander!!! So check out the civilian jobs for the nearest military base. They can accept diabetics, and the benefits are wonderful -- great health coverage, the opportunity to travel if you want to, and a real service to your country. There are civilians in just about every area of the military working machine. No, the civilians do not wear the uniform, but the civilians are really the bulk of the military organization nowadays. This is because when the Cold War ended, numbers of Active Duty started being cut, and they are still being cut. My husband was 3 years at a large base in the midwest as a Group Commander, and he was asked to cut his active duty forces 2 times during this short 3-year time frame. What do they do when the active duty numbers are cut? They contract the jobs out to civilians. The jobs don't go away, but they are just done by civilians. You will be surprised at how many civilian jobs there are on any mlitary base. Please do check it out.I am a type 1 diabetic, and have been since childhood. I have had civilian jobs on military bases, and am proud to state that every young Air Force pilot-to-be is learning to fly right now using illustrations and animations that I created as a civilian contractor for the Air Force. My diabetes was not an issue at all. I do wish you the very best.",

            "answer": "I very much understand the disappointment of youngsters with Type 1 (IDDM) at not being allowed to serve in the military.\u00a0\u00a0One's military service is often the most significant period in the whole life of a veteran.\u00a0\u00a0I was a nuclear submarine officer who had completed six years of active service and was in the reserves when I developed Type 1 in my late 20s.\u00a0\u00a0I had to resign from the naval reserves as a direct result.Understandably, no one has been or ever will be allowed entry to the military services who was known to be Type 1.\u00a0\u00a0I have been interested in the stories of Type 1 diabetics who have been allowed to remain in the service in the past 25 years.\u00a0\u00a0I know of only two cases, but likely there have been others.\u00a0\u00a0One was a musician, the other was a cryptographer.\u00a0\u00a0Both held very specialized positions, and both had to muster considerable political influence (senators, congressmen, etc.) to be allowed to remain in service.\u00a0\u00a0Their being allowed to remain in service was grossly unfair to the great majority of those who develope Type 1 diabetes while in the military who are forced out.\u00a0\u00a0But let me state my opinion clearly.\u00a0\u00a0Type 1 diabetes is plainly and uncontestably disqualifying for military service.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone who is familiar with the military AND Type 1 DM knows this.\u00a0\u00a0There should NEVER be any relaxation of the requirements that military servicemen of any specialty, combat or non-combat, be FULLY medically fit.I consider myself extremely lucky that my Type 1 developed after I had completed my active military service.\u00a0\u00a0I do very much sympathize with all the young Type 1 people who won't be allowed to join a military service.\u00a0\u00a0But they should already know by now that life isn't fair.",

            "answer": "I really have a hard time understanding why the military doesn't allow diabetics but other jobs with physical activity do. Law enforcement or fire fighting are good examples.\u00a0\u00a0Its almost 2010 and I still feel as thought that treatment situations aren't like they were in the 1920's or even 1950's and hope that people don't still think that.Its like being discriminated against even without having any sort of a chance or ability to prove one's self because of old mind sets.Things are extremely different.\u00a0\u00a0They even have pumps now that mimic a pancreas.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I keep thinking that a group of people with these situations should get together some how and possibly organize into some sort of group with permission of the us government and or local national guard or something like that to create a group of people that would be willing to go through some sort of test situation to let people try and or prove themselves.\u00a0\u00a0This might sound strange but here's what I would be thinking:All type one people participating should be on pump therapy.All people must be on a guided exercise plan with appropriate measures engaged to certify standards that meet or exceed whats done in current situations that the military does for PT.Certain types of standards for a1c type testing should be met over time as to what sugar levels are.\u00a0\u00a0Heck the RCMP in Canada allows diabetics if you prove that you are under good control.I'm sure there could be more added to this situation and or statements but this is just a big brain storm session that just came to me.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I'm just tired of thinking that no one is listening to our situations.\u00a0\u00a0I know the legal complexity is probably big but I think there's a lot of people out there that would be willing to try this under certain types of waivers.\u00a0\u00a0I see so many posts out there where people want to do things like this all over but feel as though its not possible but inside of themselves they know its possible.Sometimes I feel as though that diabetics are healthier people than regular people.\u00a0\u00a0Just wished that someone out there would give us a chance.",

Chaplin's are always officers with a bachelor's degree. I personally have never met a diabetic Chaplin so far. I am a medic and I will tell you why I am pretty certain why diabetics are not allowed to join the military. You have to be able to deploy. If you are not you cannot join. There is no saying I just want to join but, never go overseas. Diabetics are non-deployable because during wartime it is hard sometimes to get medications and medical supplies shipped out to units that need them. Diabetes controled with insulin or medication is a life-threatening condition. What happens when you run out of meds and no meds have arrived? It is a liablity.",
