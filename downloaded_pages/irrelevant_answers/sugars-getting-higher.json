Its about watching your carb intake as well as sugar. If you want any info/help with the diet let me know. My doc checks my readings once a week and a high risk specialist also monitors my readings every week. My daughter is measuring within normal range and I'm 32 weeks.",

            "answer": "Im 23 weeks and have GD. I do check my sugar levels four times a day plus im on insulin. The effects I was told were the baby will be larger than normal therefore I have to have a c section. Plus when baby is born they have to watch his sugar level for the first day because in the womb he has been depending on me. Those were the only things they told me. Ask questions when you go back to the doctor. But I Hope I helped a little.",

    "question": "Im borderline gd and my dr prrscribed me a glucose meter to check my sugars 4 times a day. I have weekly appointments and they are watching me closely bc i had low fluids at 30 weeks. I get a non stress test and an ultrasound fluid check every week and we also review my sugars. Lately they have been high, not just a little high but like 155 (normal is below 120) and they seem to be unconcerned about it. My baby is 3 weeks ahead in growth and i am getting more and more uncomfortable. Im 33weeks now. Isnt high sugars a bigger concern than they are making it? I told my dr i wasnt ok with them rushing thru this information with me if it is important. What risks are there when i have such high sugars? I eat pretty well and drink water constantly and they are staying high now.. are my doctors being negligent or am i overexaggerating?",
