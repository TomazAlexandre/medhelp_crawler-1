            "answer": "Hi,The most important factor to a healthy pregnancy is maintaining excellent blood sugar control and having a supportive medical team.If you have any existing complications these need to be assessed, particularly things like kidney function.However, it is very possible to have a healthy and successful pregnancy, even with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It does take lots of work, but it is possible.You may try low carb eating, which is very helpful for blood sugar management.\u00a0\u00a0 Type 1 grit is a group with great support and information on low carb eating for diabetes management.\u00a0\u00a0Look also into Dr. Richard Bernstein's Diabetes SOlutions book and Diabetes University (Utube), which has great and useful series of lectures on managing blood sugars.A CGM (continuous glucose monitoring device) can also be very useful, though frequent finger prick testing is also ok.",

            "answer": "I have been T1D since I was 16 and just turned 35. I am pregnant with my 4th and my A1c was down to 6.7 just before pregnancy and now at 6.4. There are a few things that could be different with pregnancy but I would speak with your doctor. Large babies are a big thing with T1d's especially if uncontrolled. I had other complications also but everyone is different. Diabetics are considered high risk pregnancies but the right OB will become your Best friend! Best of luck!",

    "question": "Is it widely the norm to have a healthy pregnancy/healthy baby if you have had type 1 diabetes since childhood?\u00a0\u00a0What are the biggest risks?\u00a0\u00a0What should be the biggest focus to maintain a healthy pregnancy/baby?Looking for opinions, suggestions, personal stories, resources like websites.\u00a0\u00a0I've already been doing some reading and have gone to my endocrinologist with this question.I am 32 years old, have had type 1 since I was 12 years old.\u00a0\u00a0Over the years I have had better and worse control as life goes/ had a few years of VERY bad control in my late 20s.\u00a0\u00a0The past two years I have been focusing largely on health... Now have an a1c typically around 7.0 (working on getting that lower), healthy weight, routine check ups.I've been working on developing a very healthy lifestyle, from what I eat to how I exercise- doing triathlons, rarely drink any alcohol, don't smoke, etc.\u00a0\u00a0No other big health problems.Thank you for any support.",
