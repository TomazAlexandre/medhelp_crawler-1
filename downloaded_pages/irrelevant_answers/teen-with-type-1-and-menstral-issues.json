    "question": "My daughter is 16 and is a type 1 diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0She has pituitary suppression and insulin binding antibodies.\u00a0\u00a0Her specialist have put her on the insulin called Apidra and is working wonderfully but she is having a lot of menstrual problems.\u00a0\u00a0They have put her on several different pills to help control this but none are working.\u00a0\u00a0Every time she has spotting or a true cycle, she gets very sick to her stomach and her sugar rises very high. She goes into DKA very quickly with this. This seems to be her only downfall right now to controlling her sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Her sugars are usually great until an episode comes on and she is very sick.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have any advice for us?\u00a0\u00a0We have literally tried everything to get her under control.",
