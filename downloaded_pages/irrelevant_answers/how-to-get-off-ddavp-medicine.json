            "answer": "Hi-I take DDAVP too because I had a pituitary cyst that caused my gland to stop working.Over the years my Diabetes Insipidus has fluctuated in terms of how much DDAVP I need to take. Unfortunately I pee/ and get thirsty without the med. Right now I am taking the smallest pill, and break it in half. I take it before I go to bed. I seem to be able to do ok without taking it during the day (because I can drink/pee as much as i need to. If I do not take the DDAVP at night I wake up 4-6 times needing to drink water and pee.What test said that you do not need DDAVP? The water deprivation test is the gold standard.I hope to hear from you.Horselip",

            "answer": "Hey there and thanks for responding! Ok, first off-the reason why my endocrinologist thinks I don't need my ddavp pill anymore is because he said my sodium level has never went low (I think he said it gets either extremely low or high when you have diabetes insipidus). I also went for a urine test called urine specific gravity right before I take my next dose of the pill. He said it came back fine/normal-which I think ment my urine was fine without the pill. He also gave me more of those tests to take whenever I'm ready (for example space out my pill dose and go before the next dose to see if I need the pill). He's been saying for many years now he doubts I even need the pill anymore, which is interesting and I feel he's correct. He also explained to me about how when someone has a trauma or injury to the pituitary and it gets CUT OFF it can even still recover. And in my situation, mine was only injured. He said something like how the hypothalmus gets in shock at first from the trauma and needs DDAVP, but then it recovers. Now in your case (just as mine), I know what you mean when you say you go to the bathroom alot AND get thirsty when off the pill, as do I. But see, when you urinate ALOT, you will get thirsty...And, it's possible that one on this pill can be urinating alot when the next dose is near, because that dose is waring off. Which means, the retained water, is being released! Also it takes an extra day for kidneys not to concentrate the urine. So complicated thing and like a contradiction....",

            "answer": "Hi again,It may be that you do not need the DDAVP any more? Yes, it is more common for people to have it temporarily after a surgery or TBI and then it clears up.But then there are folks who do have it forever. I was in the hospital a few years ago for a surgery. I was catheterized and my urine went into a container. The nurses were shocked when they saw that i urinated ~ 3 gallons a day!!! needless to say DDAVP was ordered. All these residents came to see this as they had never had a DI case before at the facility where I was.What dose do you take and how often? Have you ever just stopped taking it to see what happens? As long as you are awake, and up I would think that if you need fluid you will just drink it. You could chart your input/output for a while once off of the DDAVP to show your endo just to make sure. If are able to sleep through the night without medication that is a good sign too.I do find that if I overuse the DDAVP I retain fluid and this could causes my electrolytes to dilute (have labs). Also I gain water weight. When I first started using DDAVP ~9 years ago i had to weigh myself every day and measure my input and urine output to get the \"hang\" of it. The rule was if I gained more than two pounds in day I was to cut back on my fluid intake and dose.Good luck!Horselip",

            "answer": "Oh so interesting how they didn't have any DI case in the facility you were at! Sometimes I find doctors don't even know what it is and think it's diabetes, lol.Well I am on now, 0.1 MG of Desmopressin (generic for DDAVP) twice a day, every 12 hours. I used to be on 0.2 MG's years ago-I've been on this stuff for 16 years. *sigh*I have tried to not take the pill and recently I've been able to stretch it to 14 hours successfully instead of every 12 hours. If I go more than that, I will go to the bathroom every 20-35 minutes. But my endo told me that it could be the retained water...and to just keep spacing out the ddavp.Even say that it was really all the retained water that I'm letting out, I wonder how many hours that could possibly last! I went as far as to delay my next dose for 9 hours, and I was urinating every 20 minutes! I never got dehydrated tho (I felt fine) but my urine was still concentrated. My endo also says it takes an extra day for the kidneys to get back to normal and to not concentrate the urine as much. I don't even believe I have diabetes insipidus anymore, but my body is so traumatized and used to this pill, it's making it real hard to get off it! I guess I will just keep spacing the pill over a long lengths of time. Hopefully that will work!Sorry to sound so confusing. Thanks for all the help :)",

            "answer": "Hi eryts,old post but just wanted to find out if you were able to wean off Desmopressin? How are your urine test results? Do you think you still have diabetes insipidus?Your wean off doesn't sounds good: every 20 minutes going to toilet..I personally don't go that often at this point. I just drink a lot and urinate most of calcium out..I was diagnosed recently and suggested to take\u00a0\u00a0Desmopressin. Hesitant about starting it as I'm trying to wean off prednisolone..Plus some doctors not sure if I have diabetes insipidus.",

    "question": "How do you wean off the medicine DDAVP? I've been taking this medicine for many years only to find out my tests say I don't need it (I had small injury to pituitary in brain). Unfortunately I find it almost impossible to wean off because it makes you go to the bathroom ALOT after the medicine ware's off! since it's an anti diuretic/water retaining pill! Confusing and tricky.",
