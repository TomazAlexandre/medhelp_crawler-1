            "answer": "That is a reasonable big change in your RX.\u00a0\u00a0You should call the eye doctor that prescribed the new glasses and make an appointment for a \"glasses recheck\" it is reasonable NOT to be charged for this service. Take your new and old RX in to have your eyes retested and the glasses rechecked. It is also reasonable for the optical company to remake your glasses without charge at least once.Do this quickly as if you wait more than a month many opticals will charge you to recheck.JCH III MD",

            "answer": "Those prescriptions are all over the place. If you get a new pair of glasses in the USA and have problems in the first 30 days its customary for the Eye MD or optometrist to repeat the glasses test for free as well as check the glasses and the optician to remake the glasses at nor charge. Many companies that make glasses also give a money back guarentee if the person is no\u00a0\u00a0happy with RX in 30 days.Can you return them all for credit.When glasses RX are all over the place one thinks of undiagnosed diabetes or diabetes that is out of control. If you have diabetes or family history of diabetes or increased thirst, increased urination and unexplained weight loss you should be tested.JCH IIIMD",
