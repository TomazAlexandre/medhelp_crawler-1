            "answer": "Hello,Most cases of fungal infections respond to over-the-counter products, which contain any of several basic ingredients: miconazole, tolnaftate, terbinafine,ketaconazole and clotrimazole. You can consult a pharmacist and get any cream or lotion containing these ingredients.Also keep the area dry as fungi thrive in humid skin and hence try to keep the skin as dry as possible. Wear cotton undergarments and change them twice daily. Various reasons for recurrent or persistent fungal infection are incomplete treatment ,treatment resistance, co-existing dermatitis, diabetes and low immunity. Treatment resistance can be overcome by applying a cream with a combination of antifungals (Clotrimazole 1%, Miconazole nitrate 2%, Tolnaftate 1% and Butenafine hydrochloride 1%).It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Hello,Fungal infections can recur but if you keep the area dry and clean then chances are less that it will recur. Take bath daily and then dry thoroughly by pat drying, not rubbing. A hairdryer is useful if you have hairy groins. The damp skin is an ideal site for fungi to multiply. Also use Abzorb powder on the area.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided.
