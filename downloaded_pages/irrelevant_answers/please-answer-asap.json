    "question": "I am very worried about my father's health recently. He has begun to feel constantly tired and has even fallen asleep at the wheel, at which I have had to wake him. He is 51 yrs old, quite overweight and is a fairly heavy smoker.My older sister thinks that this is perhaps a symptom of diabetes. If so I would be grateful if someone could assist me on this matter.",
