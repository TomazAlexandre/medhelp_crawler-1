            "answer": "I'm not familiar with this test, but I suggest eating oatmeal, fruit, and eggs, and maybe some yogurt too. I usually have that for breakfast because I have to wait a bit before I can take lunch at work, and sometimes I'm still not even hungry enough when lunch rolls around. And water! Again, that is if all of that is compliant with the glucose test.",
