    "question": "my husband had signs and symptoms of diabetes for 15years before he went to see a doctor. After all the usual tests it was confirmed and he has started on medication. He has diabetic retinopathy for which he is getting treatment and regular B12 injections and the doctor has given him all the usual checks. He last saw him in July last year but has seen the nurse for a blood test twice and his b12 injections. My worry is that he hates going to the doctor but he is getting increasingly\u00a0\u00a0weak .He has no energy -sleeps a lot -most times I have to help him button his clothes as he has poor feeling in his fingers. This last two weeks he has slurred his words a couple of times and felt dizzy and spent days in bed but said it must be an infection.\u00a0\u00a0He has frequent bouts of either constipation or runs to the point where we have a complete bed change its that bad. He is not a lazy person. He has had no more weight loss since and at times he has a poor appetite but sometimes he is really hungry. Sorry to go on but he won't bother the doctor and said its his age . He is 70. Is this all due to his diabetes or am I missing something.",
