            "answer": "These are a collection of non-specific symptoms that can be caused by a variety of conditions.The neurological issues like fatigue, headache, and numbness can be evaluated with an MRI as well as nerve conduction studies to rule out many of the major neurological disorders.Irregular heartbeats can be evaluated via an echocardiogram as well as Holter monitor.The pain under the right rib can be due to a variety of GI causes (which can be evaluated with an ultrasound or CT scan) as well as pulmonary issues.\u00a0\u00a0If negative, musculoskeletal injury can be considered.I would consider a neurology referral at this point.These options can be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

            "answer": "Tanya, many of those symptoms sound like fibromyalgia and you have said that you have this.\u00a0\u00a0Fibromyalgia can flare up bad, and at points you will feel like you have energy but be careful because it is deceiving and you will end up feeling way worse if you \"over-exert\".Also you may look into if you are a celiac (allergic to wheat...) or if you have excessive candida in your gut, as both of these can cause many of your symptoms and I have read that there may be a link between these and Fibro or CFS.",

    "question": "I have been having episodes for the past 15 years. I've always had fatigue issues. For about 2 week I'll have a little energy and then sudden severe fatigue, and drowsiness. Then I get irregular heart beats, and non edema all over, pressure and pain in one side of my nose, mild headache and a mild ache under right rib that radiates to my back. This last for about a week. Then all hell breaks loose.\u00a0\u00a0I urinated every 20 minutes ,for about 12 hours and then the horrible episodes start. I get a numbnes that starts in my right foot, my whole right side gets numb, I have a hard time talking, thinking, breathing. My breathing feel like my body is telling itself not to breath, like I'm being smothered. I cry for no reason and I feel really sick. It used to last a few minutes, but now it last for 1 hour. After it's over, it takes almost a whole day to get over the side affects. I'm left with memory issues and fatigue 24/7. I have no life and no clue of a diagnosis. I've been worked up for everything,ie. lyme, mitochondia,ms,etcI do have at the present, a compressed pituatary, goiter, temporal wasting in right tempal,can't climb stairs, high bp, had hysterectomy and mastectomy, and have fibromyalgia. My eye doctor said he's sees evidence of a brain injury, But I did't have any. Since after all these year I've been worked up for almost everything. I'm at a big loss here. I just had a horrifing episode yesterday and I need to try to look for answers again. Something was missed. Do you have any thoughts on my stange situation?",
