            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!What you have are probably twitches. This could be due to peripheral neuropathies like diabetes or due to pinched lumbar nerve. Foot arch strain due to wrong foot wear too can cause this.I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

I also have had slight pins and needles in my hands on waking some days.\u00a0\u00a0I put this down to falling on my elbow and chipping it a year ago and wearing the wrong footwear.\u00a0\u00a0I have also been travelling and carrying heavy bags. Do you think i should get myself to the doctors?",
