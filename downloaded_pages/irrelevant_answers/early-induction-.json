            "answer": "My induction was because my cervix doesn't open (3kids later I can hold them forever). I got there super early in th morning, signing the baby release papers, within 2 hrs got my epidural then had surgery, recovery time was boring because everybody was with my baby but my csection didn't bother me. Vaginal birth I couldn't walk my lady parts were swollen",
