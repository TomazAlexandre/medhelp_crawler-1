    "question": "I have a friend with Type 1 diabetes who wants to lose 10 pounds that she has gained over the years (subsequent to her diagnosis 25 years ago).\u00a0\u00a0She is unable to do so, because when her insulin becomes \"low\" she has to drink coca-cola to quickly restore sugar into her system (she uses an insulin pump to try to stabilize her blood glucose levels).\u00a0\u00a0My question is, has anyone out there with Type 1 diabetes tried to lose weight, and if so, what sort of diet did they follow?\u00a0\u00a0 Also, what has their physician/nutritionist recommended when they experience moderately \"low sugar levels\" to restore them, if not coca-cola?\u00a0\u00a0And finally, has anyone commented on whether or not the cola should be with with or without caffeine?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for any input.\u00a0\u00a0She exercises on the treadmill.",
