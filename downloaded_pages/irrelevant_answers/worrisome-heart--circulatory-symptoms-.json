            "answer": "Don't know what may cause it, but if you have a history of 70 at rest, then 50, even 60 could cause some dizziness, headache and some of you other symptoms.Irregular heart beats is quite common and usually benign, I believe and it seems so do you doctors.\u00a0\u00a0It is good you have been checked, by doctors including a cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0Some of you symptoms suggest a minor heart attack, if there is such a thing.As for diabetes, I think not if not in your blood test.\u00a0\u00a0 But watch you sugar, ti can cause lots of problems, you may want to try cutting sugar out of you diet and then focus on dropping a few pounds, you will be surprised how much it helps.I am not obese, at 6' 5\" and 230 pounds, but I was as high as 250 and I can tell the difference, and benefits of losing abouit 10% of my weight, closer to 8%.\u00a0\u00a0A little loss can help big time.",

            "answer": "I did start exercising a few months ago out of worry. I'd do an hour and a half of cardio a day, split between two sessions of 45 minutes with a pulse of 150 to 180 (i'm 19). I also did some weights. Although over time it seemed to worsen my symptoms. I stopped this routine and my symptoms subsided more but are still there.I'm getting a 2 week holter monitor in october also.",

    "question": "For a number of months i've been getting frequent palpitations, usually in the form of pounding in my chest when I'm lying down and extra beats, less often the skipped beats. I've also had sharp pains around the left side of my chest, back, and arm, that do not seem to be muscle pain. More recently I've noticed some tingling in my fingers and feet. It's not that often and doesn't last long, but I've never noticed it before. Rarely I feel slightly light headed or in sort of a daze, but it doesn't seem related. With all of this I also get frequent tinnitus and sometimes short headaches.So far I've had blood work, an EKG, and stress test. All have come back normal. I scored excellently on my stress test even though I am obese and more or less out of shape. My blood work showed my cholesterol out of the normal but nowhere near the dangerous range. My insulin is also a bit high.I've spoken to an emergency doctor, my regular doctor, and a cardiologist who all tell me I'm probably fine and that I'm just more susceptible to feeling palpitations, and all the other symptoms are probably unrelated. It definitely doesn't feel that way.I was wondering if anyone might have any ideas what else this could be? The tingling leads to believe I might have diabetes although I don't have any of the thirst, urination, or fatigue symptoms.",
