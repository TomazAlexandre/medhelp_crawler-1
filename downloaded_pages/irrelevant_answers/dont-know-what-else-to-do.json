            "answer": "We don't use symptoms as an indication or lack of symptoms as an indication. Only a test will tell you.Suggestion is to stop reading about HIV and symptoms because it clearly is not doing any good to your mental status. Wait for your test results and update us when you get them.",

            "answer": "If you read Dr HHH in HIV expert forum, you would find he is of the opinion that\"HIV is extremely rare in heterosexual people in the US and other industrialized countries and the virus is almost never contracted in one-off exposures between partners who know each other.\"I'm guessing since you were very careful about unprotected sex, you would have used the same judgment in choosing your partner as well. HIV is not as prevalent in US as\u00a0\u00a0it appears sometimes. Also, not every unprotected sexual encounter with HIV + partner would result in contracting HIV.Symptoms are never useful indicators for or against a new HIV infection. Even if you go by symptoms, you should have experienced more symptoms than just\u00a0\u00a0yeast infection.I think the probability is with you and to confirm it you have taken the test as well.Googling for symptoms is a very bad idea especially when ya are in so much anxiety. Infact, it does more harm than good, as many people who come to these forums would tell you.",

    "question": "Hi I'm a 30 year old female. Within the last year and a half I have experienced mild yeast infections half way into my menstrual cyle before bleeding. Never any symptoms such as itching or burning or pain. Most of the time I probably would not have know had I not checked with my finger. Well lately the more and more I read i learn that Recurrent Yeast Infections are symptomatic of HIV. So finally I went to the doc to ensure that what I was experiencing was in fact a yeast infection and the doc confirmed that it was. I received meds to treat over the next week but while i was there I also had her perform a HIV test. Now i just have to wait on the results. I have never just been the person to have unprotected sex but I'm human and not perfect and have had some accidents in the past (ex. condom breaks) but i think that it would be safe to say that at least 89% of the time i have always used condoms with all sexual partners. I havent had any other symptoms with the exception of a couple of years ago i would get really bad headaches and my doctor insisted that it was just stress from school and work but i still insisted that she set me up with a cscan which showed no problems. other than i havent had any problems. i did get the flu last year but it was treated and cleared up with the meds prescribed in about a week. I have not lost any weight in fact i think i have gained about 50lbs in the last four years. I'm scared to death. When i research i only really find two things that cause frequest yeast infections one being diabetes and HIV. I have been tested for Diabetes and that is not the case although i know that my eating habits are awful and i drank way too many sodas and have a high sugar in take but my blood work for sugar level is always normal. I have cried to almost dont have any tears left. Everything that I have been reading says that recurrent yeast infections are a key indicator in HIV.Any Advise:",
