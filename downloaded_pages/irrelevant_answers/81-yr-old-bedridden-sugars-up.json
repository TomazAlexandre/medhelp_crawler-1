A reading of 384 is unaceptable. 500 mg of metformin is not an appropriate treatment protocol.\u00a0\u00a0There are lots of missing pieces here. You need to get her under the supervision of a physician or nurse-practicioner or nurse who specialized in diabetic treatment and instruction.",

She's only been Diabetic2 for a few years.Someone mentioned Infections will cause High test..[Kidney/Bladder Disease run in the family].I was also told by Her 'Home Health Care Nurse's' that Stress can cause Highs or Lows..This is 'highly possible' as I noticed another bladder/kidney[?] infection which caused yeast rash..[as told by hhc]\u00a0\u00a0I am Hands on care giver & Have been for many years.I Love My Mother.I don't let her lay in soiled under cloths AT ALL!! But Her Bottom looked like it was on fire to me.Called the Dr. & HHC nurse came out.We used prescriptions cream and also Olive Oil & Monostat..Still has one place I choose to let air out -several times a day-before medicating..But thank God it looks and feels much better.[Once again as I was told] - since these crazy Highs -we've had\u00a0\u00a0Commotion with an adult granddaughter Unexpectedly moving in.& the Holidays,excitement\u00a0\u00a0IDK? if eighter of these situations make sense to you all...I was just wanting to know When any of You have such Highs..What Do YOU choose to eat or feed your Loved one that has this messed up Disease?I felt so bad with the fast..If you can believe this...I\u00a0\u00a0was told all I should give her was MEAT\u00a0\u00a0or PEANUT BUTTER\u00a0\u00a0!!!\u00a0\u00a0 Okay this is what I was told when she had the Lows last year with the exception of OJ/Real Sugar/Candy..

            "answer": "If your mum likes porridge, that is a good breakfast to have.\u00a0\u00a0You can either make it with milk or with water and add some fruit or a little of something your mum likes.\u00a0\u00a0Porridge is very good because it is a slow release food and will not spike up the blood and then drop suddenly.\u00a0\u00a0This is what happens when eating cakes, chocolate and sweets.If your mum has had problems with urine infections and kidney disease, peanut butter is not a good choice because it contains purines which can cause kidney problems and to the formation of kidney stones.Any type of food in small quantities is fine, but not highly refined and sugary foods.\u00a0\u00a0Use brown bread instead of white.\u00a0\u00a0If your mum will only eat white bread, then give her a small piece.\u00a0\u00a0Vegetables are a good choice, just go easy or avoid peas and sweet corn.\u00a0\u00a0Fruit is good too in moderation.If your mum likes eggs, then these are fine.\u00a0\u00a0Home made soups are good.Don't bother with foods that are labelled \"diabetic\".\u00a0\u00a0These contain chemicals and can lead to diarrhea.\u00a0\u00a0Sugar free is fine, but to read the labels because sugar free can be laden with artificial sweetners and too much fat.It is difficult with the soreness.\u00a0\u00a0Do not use normal soap as these are not skin friendly.\u00a0\u00a0Baby washes should be fine.\u00a0\u00a0Sudocrem may help if the other creams and lotions from the doctor don't.\u00a0\u00a0When the doctor comes, ask if the soreness may be from Thrush.\u00a0\u00a0This can be a problem and an antifungal cream will help.\u00a0\u00a0A one single oral dose of Fluconazole which treats fungal infections may help.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "I have checked and had to convert the sugar readings that you gave.384 mg/dl (American) = 21.33 mmol/l (British)360 mg/dl (American) = 20.00 mmol/l (British)341 mg/dl (American) = 18.94 mmol/l (British)Although your mum's sugars have come down a little, this is still high.Let me know how you got on with the doctor.Do keep in mind that a person with diabetes will have difficulty to control high blood sugar levels when they are ill and have an infection and as you so rightly say, also to do with the fact that the energy is not being used.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "The doctor should have explained to you that metformin is a slow release medication.My husband is on the 1000g of metformin, 1 to be taken after breakfast and 1 after teatime as well as an insulin injection.Because my sugar levels are not so high, I am on 500mg of metformin that I take after my tea in the evening.\u00a0\u00a0Metformin should only be taken after food.We eat normal food, but keep off processed foods and try and avoid eating cakes, chocolates, etc, but sometimes we do succumb to temptation.\u00a0\u00a0Fried foods and foods that are high in fat can also increase the sugar levels.You can keep a food diary of everything that is consumed and that will help you to see how things are doing and what to avoid.Keep off bananas they contain a lot of sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Some people may be OK with half a banana.\u00a0\u00a0A lot of it is to do with portion sizes too.When the sugar levels are too low, have a digestive biscuit or a piece of fruit.Fluconazole isn't an antibiotic, it is an antifungal medication.You clearly have a medical problem and it is a good thing that the doctor is keeping an eye on you too.Do you have diabetes too?\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, once nerves are damaged through high sugar levels there is no cure.If you are experiencing pains due to arthritic problems or damage through diabetes, an antidepressant called Amitriptyline is sometimes prescribed to help relax the nerves so as not feel the sensations of nerve pain.Do go and see your doctor in 3 days time like he suggests and get checked out.\u00a0\u00a0Your health is just as important as your mum's.\u00a0\u00a0If you are not well, who will be looking after your mum?Best wishes.",
