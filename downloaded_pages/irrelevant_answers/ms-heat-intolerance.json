            "answer": "I have never heard of swelling with MS heat intolerance. MS heat intolerance is more like you are a computer and you overheat and everything gets slower or weaker. Like you can hardly stand or walk. Your thinking slows down. People have trouble walking to there car in a hot parking lot. Sometimes they can't get out of a swimming pool. I am not sure what would cause swelling.Alex",

            "answer": "Hi there Marian,Sorry i don't have much time at the moment to get on line but i just wanted to let you know that what you are describing, is not associated with MS heat intolerance or otherwise known as 'Uhthoff's phenomenon'.Physical swelling is typically caused by fluid retention, the swelling is called Edema or Oedema and its basically excess fluid trapped in the body's tissue, it's most common in the hands, ankles, legs and feet and it's associated with venous or lymphatic system conditions but not neurological conditions like MS....Some times when it's only in the peripheral limbs it's referred to as 'peripheral edema', it's common for hot or humid weather, diets high in salt, sitting or standing in one position for long periods to make it worse, the fluid pools in its lowest points ie hands, legs and feetHope that helps........JJ",

            "answer": "Looking at family history can be interesting but if you are starting to think there could be a specific genetic association to what's been happening to you and your great grand aunt, then the likely hood of that is highly unlikely, there would be too many genetic disassociation's for her dx to be relevant to your mothers children ie you....Diabetes and or Cancer can definitely run in families, not always the same type of cancer either, there is more of a genetic susceptibility but the further away genetically you get the less likely the connection becomes. Your looking at 1 person 3 generations away and who isn't really a direct line to you because it's your grandfathers sister....additionally the type of cancer she had\u00a0\u00a0macroglobulinemia is rare (3 cases per million people per year), and twice as common in men and with an average age of mid 60's....so your grand aunt is less likely to be connected to your situation at all.Cancer as i've mentioned before does run in my family, both maternal and paternal, i've got the direct line genetic association with at least first (dad) and second (both his parents) generations, 3 different types of cancer on my dads side, and on my mothers side grandmother, aunt and cousins just the one type, breast cancer. My father died of bowel cancer, by the time he had his first symptom and was dx it had already spread to his liver, he'd had bowel cancer early <50 but whilst cancer does run in both sides, i'd still only have more of a genetic association to breast cancer if my mother was dx too, skipping my direct line lessens the link to me and mine..Family history is interesting but try not to read more in to things if you canHope that helps....JJ",

    "question": "HiIn 2014 while on holiday in Spain, my ankles and feet swelled very badly, since then anytime it gets warm this happens and they become very painful. My GP has prescribed tablets for two weeks to help with this discomfort. Yesterday i went for a walk and my hands swelled especially my fingers. They felt very tight and my right fingers in particular were tingling for up to an hour when i came home.I never suffered this before 2014, and am wondering is this a symptom of MS heat intolerance. They ache very badly and by the end if the day the swelling and pain is very uncomfortable. I feel cool surfaces help with the discomfort.Thanks for your thoughtsMarian",
