            "answer": "Hi,If one\u2019s parents are suffering from diabetes or heart disease, the risk is definitely more compared to those whose parents are not suffering from the same.I\u2019ll suggest you to get your blood sugar test done(fasting as well as 2 hrs post meal glucose) at least every alternate year if not annually. There\u2019s another test known as HbA1c which can tell the status of the past 3months of glucose status.I\u2019ll also suggest to get a regular examination of blood pressure done (at least annually) and in case you develop any symptoms suggestive of CHF like shortness of breath, weakness, swelling of feet etc, you should consult a physician and will need further tests like ECG, echocardiography for the evaluation of the functioning of the heart.I sincerely hope that helps. Please do keep me posted. Kind Regards.",

            "answer": "My mother also died of congestive heart failure, when I was 22.\u00a0\u00a05 years prior to it she had a massive stroke which impaired her speech and ability to communicate.\u00a0\u00a0We, my\u00a0\u00a0younger sister and I never knew she had fluid in her lungs.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor treating her at the time never checked.\u00a0\u00a0She kept complaining of severe pain in her upper chest from shoulder to shoulder and difficulty breathing when lying down.\u00a0\u00a0The Dr. dismissed it as athritis and bursitis, and we were to young and naive to question a doctor. Don't jump to the conclusion however that you will get these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0My mother had other factors.\u00a0\u00a0There is a family history of heart disease and she was a smoker and recovered alchoholic (17 yrs. clean and sober), plus her recent stroke.\u00a0\u00a0I hope I helped you if, even a little.\u00a0\u00a0Please DO see a Dr. if you do experience any symptoms of pain, difficulty breathing or tightness in the chest area.\u00a0\u00a0God Bless, and best wishes to you.",

            "answer": "The hereditary factor you can not change.\u00a0\u00a0However, you can watch your diet very closely, which will help.\u00a0\u00a0My mom's mother and father both had heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0My mom had 10 siblings.\u00a0\u00a0All siblings and herself had and have severe heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0Know your cholesterol numbers.\u00a0\u00a0What is your LDL?\u00a0\u00a0What is your HDL?\u00a0\u00a0What is your triglyercides? What is your blood sugar?\u00a0\u00a0If the LDL is 100 or below, the HDL is 50 or above, and the triglyercides are 150 or below, get your blood work done every year to watch to see if it goes up.\u00a0\u00a0If it goes up, you can drastically change your diet.\u00a0\u00a0I know that not eating red meat, especially beef drops the LDL and triglyercides tremendously.\u00a0\u00a0I gave up beef 13 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I know eliminating pork drops the LDL even lower.\u00a0\u00a0Fresh organic vegetables are the best and taste the best.\u00a0\u00a0Canned vegetables contain lots of salt.\u00a0\u00a0Salt is not good for the heart.\u00a0\u00a0Fat and sugar cause Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Eating fast food rich in fat causes diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0That is why so many young kids are developing diabetes now.\u00a0\u00a0Vitamin B and Vitamin D is good and a lot of people are not getting enough of these important vitamins.\u00a0\u00a0Brown rice is a good thing to eat and is filling.\u00a0\u00a0Salmon is rich in Omega 3 which is good for the heart.\u00a0\u00a0Read labels and watch for fat or salt content.\u00a0\u00a0I, myself, an concerned about developing heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0My bloodwork is LDL 79, HDL 52, and triglyercides 35.\u00a0\u00a0I went a little too far with the diet changes and became anemic, but have adjusted now and have my hemoglobin up to 16 (which is high).\u00a0\u00a0Another thing to think about is people who have inflammation also can have inflammation in their arteries.\u00a0\u00a0This creates a sticky spot where cholesterol can stick and accumulate.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure that you are aware of any inflammation in your body.\u00a0\u00a0Aspirin can bring the inflammation down.\u00a0\u00a0Lecithin also is a great supplement which helps the heart to maintain healthy slippery arteries, which is what we all need.\u00a0\u00a0Ask your doctor about these factors and make sure that you monitor your health and blood work at least once a year.\u00a0\u00a0Diet, exercise and reducing stress help.\u00a0\u00a0Take care.",

    "question": "My mom died in July of Congestive Heart Failure and Diabetes. I held her as she died. She had so much fluid in her lungs and a blood clot entered her heart. I want to know what did she feel as she was dying and I am very scared that I might develop this illness as I age. My mom was 70 when she died.
