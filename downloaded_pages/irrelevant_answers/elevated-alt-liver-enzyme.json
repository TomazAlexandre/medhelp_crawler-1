            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia and thyroid disease, can also cause liver transaminase (AST and ALT) elevations. Most liver diseases are characterized by greater ALT elevations than AST elevations except cirrohsis and alcohol abuse. In your case AST is normal, so also other diseases have been ruled out ad usually in all these diseases the ALT and AST rise much higher than your values. This is the reason no liver disease or problems are suspected in your case and there will be no problem from the insurance sector either.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 27 year old male that drinks alcohol more than average, but not at alcoholic levels (probably around 15-18 drinks per week).\u00a0\u00a0I have had 5 blood tests in the past 9 to 10 months for various reasons (insurance applications and follow-up with primary doctor), and in each test my ALT liver enzyme has been slightly elevated near the low-to-middle 60s (72, 54, 62, 64, 68, respectfully).\u00a0\u00a0 All other blood tests are normal, including all liver function tests (AST is always around mid-20s) and others (cholesterol, glucose, thyroid, etc...).\u00a0\u00a0It has not caused me problems when obtaining life insurance or disability insurance and my doctor is not worried at all.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, my doctor specifically said that he is not worried because I display no symptoms of liver disease and my ALT is only slightly elevated.\u00a0\u00a0Also, it should be noted that I did not have any alcohol for three weeks before taking my last blood test, which resulted in an ALT level of 68.Finally, I should also mention that I am 5'10 and 165 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0I am not overweight, I run 3 miles four times a week, eat moderately healthy, and have a lot of energy.\u00a0\u00a0I have really never been sick in the past or diagnosed with any allergies or illnesses.My question is, should I be more aggressive with my doctor and request an ultrasound and more follow-up tests or just follow his recommendation and get re-tested in 6 months and see where my ALT is at.P.S.\u00a0\u00a0I plan on completely abstaining from alcohol for 5-6 weeks before my next test.Thank you in advance for your answer",
