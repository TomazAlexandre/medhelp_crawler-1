Higher amounts of vitamin D can be taken temporarily to correct a deficiency state.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't recommend over 10 000IU of vitamin D3 without medical supervision.Magnesium is the most important co factor for vitamin D absorption.\u00a0\u00a0Most magnesium is stored in the tissues, so leg cramps, foot pain or muscle twitches are usually the first signs of a magnesium deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0To add, both vitamin D and magnesium are needed for calcium absorption.",

    "question": "I've been having symptoms such as my muscles twitching and popping, my skin feeling like it was burning, fatigue, and feeling dazed. I went to the doctor and they said that I was having an anxiety attack..then I went to another doctor to get a second opinion and they took blood and said that I have a Vitamin D deficiency and I should took take calcium 1~2 times a day.Can a Vitamin D deficiency cause my muscles to twitch and pop and cause fatigue? I've never had a vitamin deficiency before.",
