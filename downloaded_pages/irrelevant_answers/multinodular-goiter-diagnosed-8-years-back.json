            "answer": "Hello!IThis with nodules is a mess - I think having had a multigoiter for 15 years and the last year a nodule started to grow from 2 cm+ to 4.4cm - and itis partially solid and cystic.\u00a0\u00a0I have been for biopsies the last 2 years but before also - but this time I am upset as the last biopsy was in May and had a scan in November andsaw the doctor on Friday - and he mentioned to me that the sample taken in May did not contain enough cells to rule out cancer.- I trusted them going in there - this is in Florida - Port St. Lucie on the east coast - and did not worry about the results as I thought if something is not right they get back to me - I have had a lot of headaches and migraines and also have fibromyalgia.\u00a0\u00a0So he wanted to take half thyroid out and I asked for another biopsy and I won't get one until end of February - this is not right and the nodule has increased double!\u00a0\u00a0The nodule is 4.4cm now. Anyone else with nodules and biopsies - and if anyone knows a real specialist of thyroid issues please then let me know.",
