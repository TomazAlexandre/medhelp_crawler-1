    "question": "After a standard appt at my doctors they decided to take me in immediately due to hypertension,diabetes and platelets decreasing etc. They started with inducement and after over 12 hours I wasn't progressing at the highest dosages they could possibly give me. Dialated to a 3 and never went farther and contractions wouldn't stay consistant so I was turned immediately for a c section jumping the line of girls who were scheduled before me surprisingly.Let me just say c section was awful in my opinion and expierence. Yes i was numbed with a spinal tap but I could still feel all the pressure that was going on from the procedure and panicked. It was a never again moment in my head lol. But it had to be done.Eli came out 9 pounds 15 ounces and screaming like a banshee at 37 +6 weeks. Come to find out I would have had to have a c section anyways due to his size and my issues even if inducement had progressed. However I would endure it all over and over again though for him \u2661 love at first sight and then some.",
