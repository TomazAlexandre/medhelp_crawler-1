    "question": "I had a battery of tests on the Myocardio Perfusion Test it says normal sinus rythem with poor R Waves, small area with photopenia in the inferior wall with significant amount of uptake noted. My Echo said Mildly dilated left atrium with normal ejection fraction 55-60. Abnormal left ventricle diastolic function. Possible Patent Foraman Ovale. My Holter said amount of 3 ventricular ectopic beats with 50 supraventricular ectopic beats, also 1 supra ventricular tachycardia . I am scheduled for an Angiogram next week. My question is what does this all mean? Also had mild regurgitation in valves. Should I be concerned.",
