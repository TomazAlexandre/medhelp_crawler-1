    "question": "Does anyone know of any sugar substitutes that don't have an aftertaste? Even Steva and Splenda have that aftertaste. I'm using raw sugar (2 tsp) right now for morning coffee because I can't find anything else right now. I even tried coconut palm sugar but figured it's just the same as using raw sugar. Any advice would be super. Thanks!",
