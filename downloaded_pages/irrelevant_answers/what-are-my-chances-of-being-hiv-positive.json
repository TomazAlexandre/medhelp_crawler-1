            "answer": "You might have stressed your body into manifesting stress-related disorders. The only thing you can really do is wait for your results and talk them over with your Dr., see someone if necessary but don't take it out on you.If you want cold hard numbers here they are: Assuming you are among the low risk population (non-college) If you have intercourse on 50 different occassions with 50 different men, you have a .001% chance of contracting HIV.As far as a female\u00a0\u00a0having vaginal intercourse with a known infected male, these studies are all over the map. It is very difficult to get any \"common\" stats on your probablility of contracting HIV from a known infected partner. Your risk, however, is known to be lower if you have intercourse with a partner already infected with HIV (HIV positive) than someone who has just contracted it (this is when the viral load is highest and most likely to be transmitted than at any other point of having the virus)If you had vaginal intercourse with someone who is definitely infected you should ask your doctor for some antiretrovirals ( drugs used to help prevent a virus after exposure to it)xoxo- D.",

    "question": "mid 30's, female. Four yrs ago, I was engaged to be married to a man who I believed to be very honest. He claimed to give blood regularly and also told me that he'd never had a venerial disease. About three months before my wedding , I found out that he was a criminal sex offender and had used drugs ( cocaine ). I am not permiscuous. I have always practiced safe, manogamous sex with previous partners. All of whom submitted to regular HIV tests and all of whom were always negative. I had also always tested negative. My former fiance and I had unprotected vaginal intercourse only once. He did not ejaculate into my vagina, and stopped the sex act after only a few minutes.. But I am sure there were pre-ejaculatory secretions. I performed oral sex on him on three occasions and did ingest the ejaculate.\u00a0\u00a0I recently learned I have acid reflux disease and a history of diabetes in my family... I am overweight and suffer from skin rashes..Mostly friction boils in the groin area, and under the breasts and ingrown hairs on occasion. I also have strange skin pigmentation changes in the groin area ( very dark skin) I am always thirsty, I urinate alot and I sometimes feel slightly off balance or dizzy.. Admitedly, I drink way too much coffee..I smoke cigarretts and I do not eat well...recently I noticed a strange metalic taste in my mouth. It sometimes hurts when I swallow as well, especially meat or bread. I went to my doctor today and she informed me that I have a mild case of oral thrush. Another condition I've never had before. She ordered both blood glucose tests and an HIV test...It's pretty obvious I have many symptoms of possible diabetes, but many of the same symptoms can relate to HIV in Women, and I am very frightened... Considering my incidence of exposure, what would be my risk of having contracted HIV? Thank you",
