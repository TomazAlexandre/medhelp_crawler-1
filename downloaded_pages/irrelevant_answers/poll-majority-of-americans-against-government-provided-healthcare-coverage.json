As of a month ago, 34 percent supported it, virtually unchanged. To be sure, about a fifth of those who oppose it say it did not go far enough, essentially frustrated liberals.That Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency may be defined by the law would have seemed unlikely in March 2007, when as a presidential candidate he showed up for a health care forum in Las Vegas unprepared, by his own admission. When he finally developed a plan, he rejected requiring American adults to obtain health insurance and pilloried his chief opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, for supporting it.Very interesting.\u00a0\u00a0If you read on, it appears that healthcare became important to Obama due to it helping his campaign.",

            "answer": "He made a campaign promise and he kept it. Thats how I see it. And, the final result were mostly republican ideas, because Obama wanted single payor which republicans rejected so this final result was a compromise. It was also during a time when republicans had vowed to not cooperate with him on anything and fox news in particular went on a campaign to poison the people about what was in it. Not one single republican voted in favor of it because of their efforts to not cooperate, not that the plan was a bad idea. In fact it was the same plan romney had in his state and the same people that modeled that one, helped model this one. It is essentially one and the same and thus far the people who have romney care love it, mandate and all.I remember hearing about death panels and such bazaar stuff and unfortunately where dems dropped the ball was on the education of the public, was very weak giving the gop even more ammo.But regardless, if people were that adamant against it as which is rumored, Obama would not have been re elected. imo",

            "answer": "People may say they're against the ACA but when you poll them on the provisions they are all for them. People balk at one provision - mandatory care. And I can understand that. The truth is it can't be done without very very broad participation and the mandate is probably the only way to accomplish that. I pay for the healthcare for my employees and I admit I have less than 20. But, I have seen the increases and paid those increases at every renewal date and it's gotten out of control. I know that if it continues to increase like it has over the last 15 years it will be very hard to afford. And, whether anyone admits it we do pay for the emergency department visits where the vast majority of the uninsured get their primary healthcare. I am all for trying a new way and the ACA looks reasonable to me. And, I really care about my fellow Americans. I will sacrifice for them without any second thoughts. That is why I get so angry when I see so many cling to the status-quo like it's working. I wonder whether some of the people here have health insurance and, if so, whether they know what it costs or whether they pay for it. If they do and they think things are working fine then I have a real problem with their reality. And, one more thing. I have a liver transplant(June 2000) so I am tied to the medical community for life and if I truly believed our care would deteriorate like so many appear to think I would assuredly have strong reservations about the ACA. This is not a subject that I can afford to be cavalier about and I'm not worried one bit. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.Mike",

            "answer": "You and I disagree about healthcare being a right. I believe that it is a right or that it should be a right. The right of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness seems rather hollow if we are not afforded the opportunity to be healthy. Health is critical - it is perhaps the most critical feature of life and it is inextricably linked to the pursuit of happiness...in my opinion. I know this is a complex subject and there isn't room here to discuss it thoroughly.You've mentioned that you deal with pre-diabetes and diabetes. In my opinion diabetes is one of the most mismanaged chronic diseases we see today. Proper diabetes management is so very much more cost efficient than is dealing with the complications which arise from not properly managing the disease. When we get to the point where body parts are being trimmed or eyesight is shutting down or cardiovascular events are cascading the costs and the suffering become huge. But, if people are able to access healthcare before these terrible complications result then they have an opportunity to achieve a significantly better state of health and also avoid the horrible suffering - financially, physically and emotionally - that we see so often in the less fortunate members of our society. If people were diagnosed early - perhaps before they acquired full blown diabetes or shortly thereafter - and treatments and lifestyle changes were initiated early we could avoid serious consequences and major expenditures and suffering and most importantly we'd have a healthier citizenry.That is just one example of the way in which access to healthcare could result in decreasing the overall cost of providing healthcare and dramatically improving the quality of life for our less fortunate citizens. There are myriad more.Mike",

    "question": "(CNN) \u2013 President Barack Obama's re-election neutralized efforts by Republicans to overturn the Affordable Care Act and marks the continued implementation of the law, but a majority of Americans now say it's not the federal government's role to provide healthcare insurance coverage.The Gallup poll indicates 54% of Americans believe guaranteed healthcare coverage is not the government's responsibility while 44% believe it is - the first time since 2000 the Gallup poll trend has shown a majority of Americans feel the government should not be responsible for providing healthcare insurance coverage for all Americans.Before 2009, a plurality of Americans believed the government should make sure all Americans have healthcare coverage but since then Americans have wavered in their support of the idea of government-guaranteed healthcare.While the Affordable Care Act passed in March 2010, Obama's November 6 re-election victory paved the way to implementation of the remaining portions of the law. Prior to Obama re-election and following a Supreme Court June ruling upholding most of the president's initiative, the law allowed for patients with pre-existing conditions access to insurance and young adults to stay on their parents' insurance plans.(cont'd)SOURCE: http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/11/28/poll-majority-of-americans-against-government-provided-healthcare-coverage/?hpt=po_c2",
