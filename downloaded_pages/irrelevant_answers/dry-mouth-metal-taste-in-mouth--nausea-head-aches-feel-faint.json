            "answer": "I just happened on this site looking for something else, but I was very concerned for you when I saw your question. I had a good friend with these symptoms 4 years ago. She saw her family doctor also. She was checked for all sorts of things gastrically & chest. She had a BRAIN TUMOR , WHEN A METAL TASTE IS IN THE MOUTH, IT IS ONE OF THE EARLIEST SIGNS. especially when other things have been checked out. I had never mentioned the metal taste part when I told my husband my friend was having problems, but when I did, the first words from his mouth were, She needs to be checked for a brain tumor, he was a Chiropractor....and he was right but the diagnosis was too late. It had progressed too far, and her family had wasted time when they didn't go straight to Sloane Kettering with her final diagnosis. The tumor was found during a CT or MRI of her head & brain. I pray you have gotten better, but that this info will save anothers life.Lynda",
