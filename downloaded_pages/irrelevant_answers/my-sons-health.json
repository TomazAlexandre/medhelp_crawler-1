    "question": "My son is an adult autistic and has recently been diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The trouble here is that he has not had a bowel movement in almost three days.\u00a0\u00a0He says that there is no pain and there is no bloating. He just does not feel any urge to move his bowels.\u00a0\u00a0He does not feel full or uncomfortable, but he knows that this is not normal and is getting more and more upset about it.\u00a0\u00a0In the past couple of days he has had oatmeal, apple, banana, spinach, broccoli, green beans and one dose of a \"gentle\" laxative.\u00a0\u00a0When that had absolutely no effect I did not repeat the dose.\u00a0\u00a0He takes metformin, lantus, humalog and lasix.\u00a0\u00a0He recently started a supplement with iron in it, as his iron was low at his last doctor's visit.\u00a0\u00a0What can I do? Am I worrying to much? What can I tell him?",
