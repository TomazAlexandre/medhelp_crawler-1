Occlusion is observed to have occurred in 96.5% of patients at 3 months with the remainder occluded by 6 months.[1]\"Not sure how you would find a better doctor... but sounds like the docs you have aren't answering your questions or looking into them.\u00a0\u00a0You didn't say what kind of pain and complications your wife is having, but if her doctor is not properly addressing them, that is not a good thing.\u00a0\u00a0Problem with doctors is if you don't stay on top of them and question everything and make them do their jobs, it seems they want to forget about you after you walk out the door and your file is closed and filed away.\u00a0\u00a0Her OBGYN might be able to follow up with some of the doctors and demand answers.\u00a0\u00a0WHat matters is that she has a healthy remainder of the pregnancy, and a healthy delivery.COngrats on the next baby.\u00a0\u00a0:)",
