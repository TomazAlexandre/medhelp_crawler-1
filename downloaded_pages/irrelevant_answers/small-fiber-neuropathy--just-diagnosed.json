            "answer": "Your diagnosis was probably based on exclusion of other causes, classical nerve studies are not mentioned to diagnose this state but electrointerstitial scans may offer something in this field (till now these devices are FDA registered as neurological but classified as biofeedback devices), I will inspect about the latest diagnostic tools.. About the treatment, it depends from the cause. if diabetes is the cause you should control the glucose level, if you believe a physical trauma is the cause, so give it enough time for recovery. Idiopathic cases are more difficult to treat.. Its like fighting an unknown enemy.Short session of a power-plate may help, thats what I think....let me know about your feedbackDr Nassim Abi Chahineneurosurgery Medhelp",

            "answer": "Here is the impressions of my EMG exactly as it is on the paper.Left peroneal motor amplitude is reduced at the fibular head. I suspect there is a peroneal mononeuropathy at the fibular head.Absent medial plantar sensory latencies suggest a small fiber neuropathy.My symptoms are that of a burning, electric like, stabbing and lacerating typically in my feet. I had a quantitative sensory exam as well.Thank you so much!",

    "question": "I was just diagnosed with Small Fiber Neuropathy by a Neurosurgeon today using an EMG/NCV test. He tested the nerves on the very bottom of feet and there was no response.I heard it wasn't possible to diagnose small fiber neuropathy with an EMG/NCV test.\u00a0\u00a0He also explained that the nerve running down my leg next to my knee has neuropathy as wellIs it possible to diagnose with this test?\u00a0\u00a0Also, what are my treatment options for the Small Fiber Neuropathy?Thank you so much for all of your help!",
