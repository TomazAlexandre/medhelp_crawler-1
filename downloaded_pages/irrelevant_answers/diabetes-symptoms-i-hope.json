            "answer": "I'm sorry you have to worry about this. Try to get tested as soon as you can, to relieve your mind if for no other reason. Do I dare say abstain until you find out? You wouldn't want to put someone els thru what yu are going thru. Frequent urination can be a sign of diabetes. Slow healing sores, thrush, and many of your other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you fast 12 hours before blood test to get accurate results.I was diagnosed about a year and half ago with type II diabetes, and I didn't have weight loss either. My biggest marker was slow healing mosquito bites. At 5 months they were still open, itching, and bleeding. Good luck and God Bless, and let us know the results. Will be praying for a good outcome for you.",

            "answer": "Thanks very much for your reassuring comments. I think I will take your advice and get tested soon, I can't take any more of this stress of not knowing. As for abstaining, I have sworn off sex for life!One other question I do have is do they symptoms appear rather suddenly? I was just a person who used to urinate once a day or twice max, all of a sudden last week I was going 3-4 times and now around 7-8 times. Also, I don't urinate through the night. Which makes me wonder if this is anxiety triggered frequent urination.",

I'm feeling really lonely and scared right now, this is one thing I just can't tell my family or friends.I haven't gotten tested yet for HIV, but plan to do so in about 10 days when the test should be conclusive. If I get tested now, I still won't feel reassured until the test is conclusive. Will keep you updated when the results come in. Of course, I am making sure to be conscious about my health and other factors in case it is another disease like diabetes.Please pray for me. Thank you.",

            "answer": "Thanks very much for following up again. To be honest, I postponed and postponed my tests, I was so scared of what I would find. But I finally did get tested a couple days back and am negative! (for hiv). I also tested for diabetes and lupus and thyroid and a couple other things, all negative.I have no idea what caused some of my initial symptoms but one thing for sure is that many of the others were anxiety related. For example, the frequent urination for sure. The day I got my results, I went from 12 times to just 6 times and now am at my usual 3 times a day. My dentist polished my teeth and said due to the anxiety I wsa probably biting my tongue in my sleep causing the ulcers and it wasn't thrush. No more dry mouth or thirst either. I lost around 3-4 lbs during my ordeal but gained it all back again in a day or two. I has terrible insomnia which causedd headaches and other aches and fatigue, but now it's all miraculously disappeared.Obviously, I feel extremely lucky to be here and posting this. I thought for sure I was a goner for sure.Thanks again for your concern and I wish you and everyone else here all the best in your life as well. I read quite a bit about diabetes and its treatment when I thought I had it and was really impressed with all the advances made in the last couple of years especially that have made lives more manageable. I am sure and I pray that there will be a complete cure one day.",

    "question": "Hello, I am new to this thread. A couple of days ago, I posted my issue on the HIV forum since I believed I had symptoms of HIV. I believed this because of a risky encounter 5 weeks ago and the symptoms fall within the window period for HIV. However, many people on that forum say it can't be HIV since I used a condom and was thus fully protected. I hope they are right. In the meantime, I know this may sound odd but I am hoping there are other diseases (like diabetes) that could explain my symptoms.One symptom that is somewhat unusual for early HIV is that I have started to urinate frequently. Like for the past 5 days, it is upto 7-8 times a day. It is painless, sometimes clear, sometimes yellow, most often in the afternoons and evenings. I don't get up in the middle of the night to urinate though.I also have other symptoms like fever, sore throat, fatigue, some aches (knees, foot, back), an itchy rash (red spots mostly on chest, neck and stomach) that appeared initially but now has gone, although I still get some isolated itchy spots now and then. And most recently and worryingly some white patches on the tongue and sometimes looks withered. This is most evident in the morning when my mouth feels dry. Throughout the day however, I drink water and the tongue looks slightly better. I don't know however if the frequent urination and dry mouth are due to anxiety. I have not lost or gained weight, I do suffer hunger pangs sometimes but not after eating.- Do these symptoms mimic those for diabetes too? For example, have any of you who have diabetes suffered tongue issues like candidaisis or other mouth infections?- Is it so possible to urinate frequently and not suffer other diabetes effects like increases hunger or lost weight? I know that frequent urination causes dehydration which could explain the dry mouth.- Do you know if this causes white patches or thrush on the tongue or other mouth infections?Please help! I am actually really so hoping I have diabetes and not HIV. I don't know what else these symptoms could point to.I know you will recommend I get tested. However, I live in a small town where everyone knows everyone. I still need to get my HIV test done too but that will take 2 more weeks to visit another town. I don't want to get tested for diabetes here either in case it reveals HIV.Thanks so much for reading.p.s. Maybe it is relevant to say I love eating sugary stuff like candy (but have abstained in the last week due to worry), have plenty of fillings, am slightly obese and my family has some history of diabetes.",
