            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!The symptoms that you are facing could be due to atherosclerosis, clots in the blood vessels, hypothyroidism or diabetes. It does not appear to be a heart problem as you do not have chest pain, are not breathless and your blood pressure and heart rate is fine. One other possibility is anemia at an early stage. The only way to know is to conduct a few tests. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I've heard that a heart condition can cause some of the same symptoms as a thyroid insufficiency. How can you tell? I've always been active, jogging, walking with no difficulty other than muscle aches in my right leg. But within the last 2 weeks I've been feeling lightheaded, I've been having aches in my right leg, or back, or left side. My blood pressure is more or less normal (130 / <90); my heartbeat is in the 60s. Other than that I feel fatigue, like ready to fall asleep. I'm down and worried, with not much ambition. There is no shortness of breath whenever I walk or jog. I sleep well, 7 to 7 1/2 hrs, wake up usually once to go to the bathroom.",
