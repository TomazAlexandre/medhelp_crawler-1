            "answer": "It would be unusual to have prolonged symptoms directly caused by a steroid treatment of just one weekProlonged steroid treatment can result in suppression of the adrenal glands normal supply of the body's own steroids, but this takes at least approx. 6-8 weeks of continuous steroid treatmentI cannot think of a primary neurological disorder that could be causing your condition. Hormone studies should give an indication of whether a problem with secretion of hormones is from the pituitary gland (in the brain) or lower downIf you have not had testing for adrenal or cortisol deficiency you should (such as a dexamethasone suppression test or ACTH blodd levels).I cannot be more specific with the information you are giving meYou may cosider an opinion from a general endocrinologist or a rheumatologist (sounds like your disorder is within their area of expertise)Good luck",

    "question": "I received a steroid injection and a week's dose of steroids for pain a year ago. It triggered a series of systemic side effects that haven't gotten better. I've been experiencing low & concentrated urinary output, especially in the am. I'm also experiencing adjunct symptoms such as dry eyes, excessive thirst & dehydration, irrespective of increased fluid consumption.I've seen my PCP, a urologist, neurologist, ophthalmologist, and thyroid specialist at an \"academic\" hospital and they can't determine the cause and/or effectively treat my symptoms. My urine (diabetes), blood (ANA,ssa-ssb, RF, ESR) and urodynamics tests are within normal ranges. However, I did have an elevated Autoimmune thyroid antibody and was put on Levoxl. 2 months of Levoxyl hasn't helped my symptoms but It appears the steroids disturbed my hormonal balance? My PCP suggested I get additional opinions from outside specialists. Your input regarding these very frustrating symptoms would be most appreciated.Thanks",
