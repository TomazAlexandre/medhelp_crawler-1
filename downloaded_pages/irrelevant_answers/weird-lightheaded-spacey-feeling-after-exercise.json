            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Besides cardiac disorders, there could be other causes for your symptoms. The light headedness may happen if there is inadequate supply of oxygen to the brain. This can happen with cardiac disorders or lung disorders.\u00a0\u00a0In cardiac disorders there is inadequate pumping\u00a0\u00a0of blood and in lung disorders there is inadequate oxygenation. It could also be due peripheral arterial blood disorders. Symptoms are usually aggravated with exercise in cardiac disorders. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension can cause these symptoms. Again inadequate sleep, hypoglycemia, anemia and vitamin deficiencies can aggravate you symptoms of light headedness.\u00a0\u00a0Discuss these options with your consulting doctor.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "38 male, good weight, have been exercising for years.\u00a0\u00a0Lately after exercising I get a lightheaded sensation.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a history of PVCs and 2 years ago did a full cardio workup--stress test, echo, ECK, holter.\u00a0\u00a0Everything came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0I actually haven't had many PVCs lately....they come in waves but right now I'm in a \"non PVC\" period.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway I talked to my cardiologist and he asked if I can finish my 60 min cardio days (bike, treadmill, etc), and I said yes.\u00a0\u00a0Not a problem.\u00a0\u00a0He tends to think nothing is wrong with my heart.\u00a0\u00a0But why the hell am I getting lightheaded after working out?\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't happen after every workout and it can happen even if I've been sitting around for hours, but I tend to notice it right after doing some activity after prolonged periods of sitting.\u00a0\u00a0But I've never ever noticed this before a few weeks ago so why now?Any clues?\u00a0\u00a0Are there possibly some cardiac problems that could account for this, given my HR is normal, rhythmic, and I am able to do my 60 min cardio runs easily?\u00a0\u00a0Could improper breathing cause this????",
