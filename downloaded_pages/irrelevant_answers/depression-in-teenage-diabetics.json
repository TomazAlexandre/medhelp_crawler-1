    "question": "My 15-year old son is a recently diagnosed diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0In a week we meet with the endocrinologist to determine Type I or Type II.\u00a0\u00a0For a few months prior to the diagnosis, he's been quite depressed.\u00a0\u00a0His grades have slipped, he doesn't seem to care about friends or school, and he wants to sleep all the time.I have a huge family history of both Type II diabetes and depression but am wondering if there is a strong correlation with depression in teenage diabetics?\u00a0\u00a0I would also appreciate any tips or advise (I will be discussing it with the endo but would appreciate parent/patient advise).\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
