            "answer": "You should make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible just so that they can rule out diabetes. How I found out I was diabetic was through a wellness group at my job. I did all the tests, blood pressure, cholesterol tests, glucose tests etc. The results were revealed to me soon after that I had high blood pressure, high cholesterol and that I was diabetic. In fact, the RN asked me how long had I been a diabetic and I told her that I was not and that this was the first time I had heard anyone tell me that I was diabetic. To make a long story short, that happened in November. By January, I had started experiencing extra dry skin, extreme thirst, frequent urinating etc (most of the symptoms known to diabetics). That is when I made up my mind and contacted my family doctor. I was given medicine for my glucose, HBP and cholesterol and so far, they have been helping. My glucose level started at 11% and is now down to 8%. I was told to lose weight, watch my diet and exercise and that I could possibly come off all of the meds. I hope that the information that I have given, will lead you on the right path to regaining your health.Mzhrrs12",

    "question": "Ever since I came down with a really bad flu four months ago, I've been a wreck. My heart rate goes fast every time I do anything, and I've had the classic diabetes symps of extreme hunger, thirst, frequent urination and visual disturbances. I've also collapsed and had extreme dizziness. However I've been so focused on heart stuff (the tests i had done were normal and my cardiologist didn't think my heart was the cause) that I've ignored other possibilities.My pancreas and liver enzymes have been consistently raised apparently.\u00a0\u00a0But I've had my blood sugar checked a few times with the finger prick thing, and no one's ever commented on it being one way or the other. Would that be normal for diabetes? What about diabetes insipidus? And are pancreas or liver enzymes often raised for diabetics?So confused.",
