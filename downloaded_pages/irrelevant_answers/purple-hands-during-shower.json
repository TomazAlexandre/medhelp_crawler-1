            "answer": "Sounds like mild vasculitis or perhaps circulatory issues such as low blood pressure or venous insufficiency. Peripheral neuropathy is common with lupus cerebritis, which can cause conflicting signals between the nervous and circulatory systems. Recent research indicates individuals with fibromyalgia have a much greater number of sensory receptors in their blood vessels. This causes increased sensitivity and in the case of lupus or diabetes provides a greater likelihood of 'confusion' between systems. Hot or cold water can trigger an autoimmune response. In any case it has an effect on body temperature and blood pressure. Livedo Reticularis (primary or secondary) is common in women with autoimmune disorders. It's a red flag, but a fairly minor one that you can take steps to deal with now. Avoid hot and cold extremes or excessively long bathing. Limit your sodium intake (within reason) and strongly consider taking magnesium citrate or other chelated supplement to balance your electrolytes, along with a B complex such as Jarrow's B Right. Have your doctor check for anemia. The correct fatty acid ratio and non-hydrogenated saturated fat intake will keep your cholesterol levels in proper range. That is the best way to care for your nerves and veins, which is extremely important with these conditions. Vitacost or Amazon are your most affordable options for health care products. Hope this helps.",

    "question": "It only occurs when I take showers, but my hands turn purple during my showers. It only happens while showering (not while washing my hands or doing dishes etc.) which makes me think it may have something to do with full body circulation and my showers are medium to warm temperature. My rhumatologist, during a previous visit, diagnosed me with Raynaud's Syndrome but after I showed her the picture of my hands she was baffled and said it was definitely not Raynaud's. I am currently being treated for fibromylagia but just had a lupus positive blood test and I have a very strong family history of lupus and other autoimmune diseases. I was wondering is anyone could give me an explanation for my purple hands? It is not painful at all but is still worrying me.",
