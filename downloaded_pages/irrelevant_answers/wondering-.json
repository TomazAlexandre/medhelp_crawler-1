The baby will be a big baby but that's just an indication that the baby will develop diabetes some time during their life. I'm 23 and still haven't developed diabetes, but I know I will. I just eat healthy and try my hardest to exercise whenever I can. But don't worry, your baby will be absolutely fine! :)",
