            "answer": "Dear Jordanjj ,Sorry to learn about the health issues you are facing at such an early age. What you are experiencing may be due to the hormonal rush you are having at this age, but you should get it checked up by a doctor. I would advise you to tell your parents and consult a neurologist. I am sure with simple medication he should be able to help you. You should also tell the doctor if you happened to take alcohol or any form of drugs. You may also need to check your blood sugar.All the best,Solace",

            "answer": "Hello,These symptoms can be due to parasthesia skin. They are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
