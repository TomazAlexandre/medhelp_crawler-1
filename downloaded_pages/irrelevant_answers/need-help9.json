            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!This looks like an episode of transient ischemic attack wherein the blood supply to brain is temporarily cut off. The episodes last for a maximum of 24 hours and then resolve or a new symptom starts. You may need to undergo MRI of the brain or cervical spine.Another possibility is Vitamin B12 deficiency. Underactive thyroid, anemia and diabetes too should be ruled out. Abnormal levels of sodium, potassium or calcium too can behave this way.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please discuss this with your doctor and see what he thinks about it. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
