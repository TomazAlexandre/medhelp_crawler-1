            "answer": "Im 28 weeks along. I was 155 before pregnancy and now 181 so I understand. In all honesty, I don't know where all the weight has gone besides my belly and my boobs. But my doctor told me at my last one that I am gaining too much too fast as well. It made me sad but there isn't too much I can do about it. As long as I'm eating fairly healthy and exercising. I've been going to water aerobics lately at my gym (better on my back ), to hopefully help keep my weight down.",
