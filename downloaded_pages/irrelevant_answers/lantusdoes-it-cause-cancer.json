            "answer": "Thank you for posting this webcast!\u00a0\u00a0I feel a little bit relieved...but, I did have a scare one month ago, I found a lump in my breast...my doctor felt it and said that he believed that it was a cyst, I had a diagnostic mammogram and an ultrasound...nothing was visible on these tests, however, he advised me to have a surgeon check it out, just to be sure.\u00a0\u00a0I am still in the process of having that done.\u00a0\u00a0I might wait until September, to see what has been decided by the EASD, before I stop using Lantus...I'm going to have to think long and hard about this though....",

            "answer": "When posting about information found on the Internet, from a book or from other media types, I find it behooves the forum readers if a link or reference to the story was also provided in the post so they too can read for themselves, and then possibly discover other related information not provided in the original post. In this case I already knew about EASD so searching the first sentence subject matter was easy..The fact that EASD discovered that Lantus excites cancer cells in patients is of vital interest to many. Whether Lantus creates cancer in humans is another story. In lab rodents yes but the study report due in September, maybe, is aimed at whether non-cancerous humans using Lantus will become cancer targets.Whether Lantus user should jump of the bandwagon now is uncertain. The big uncertainty is what the FDA is doing about this as EASD surely has made them aware of their findings. But considering Lantus is made by Aprida who is owned by Sanofi-Aventis of France, the FDA may keep its hands off until it hears again from EASD.",

    "question": "Europe has come out with a study that implies that Lantus causes cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone out there on Lantus, and have you heard about this and will you stop using Lantus due to this news??What bothers me about this news is that the study seems a bit shaky...but, I also feel, where there is smoke, can fire be far behind??\u00a0\u00a0I, myself, am thinking of changing to Levemir, at least until the experts decide what to do.\u00a0\u00a0Only because, I have enough health problems, if I can save myself some anguish, I think I will...What's your take on this issue??",
