            "answer": "Hi,Your mother will undergo surgery known as carotid endarterectomy since the blood clot in the eye came from the carotid artery in the neck. The surgery involves opening the lumen of the internal carotid artery, removal of the atheromatous plaque. The artery is then closed. The overlying layers are closed. Many surgeons lay a temporary shunt to ensure blood supply to the brain. The operation can be done under general or local anaesthesia.Hope this helps!",
