            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.There is a conditions called Acanthosis nigricans. This is a skin condition that causes increasingly thicker and darker patches or streaks around joints and body areas with many creases and folds (such as knuckles, armpits, elbows, knees, and the sides and back of the neck).\u00a0\u00a0Acanthosis Nigricans is not contagious, or thought to cause any symptoms. It can, however be a warning sigh of other conditions such as type 2 diabetes and health problems caused by obesity. It is also sometimes (although rarely) seen with the use of oral contraception and cholesterol medications.If you are concerned about diabetes, I recommend that you see your doctor and have your blood sugar checked. Mention your concern about the neck discoloration.I hope this helps.Cathy",

    "question": "Hi, I have had a darkened neck for as long as I can remember now. I used to not pay attention to it much, I'd ignore it but now that I am 21 years old (213 lbs) I've been feeling real bad over this. Ever since I can remember, my neck has been very noticeably darker than the rest of my body. It's the same with my armpits. I've used dove deodorant for a long time, and I thought that's what had been causing the darkening of my armpits, since I have barely noticed an allergic reaction to this deodorant. But that doesn't explain my neck. I try to avoid taking pictures unless my hair covers my neck because of the darkening. I recently went to the emergency room and a nurse tols me I should really get it checked out cause it could be diabetes. I do not feel sick or have ever felt sick before. I have a 5 year old, and even when I was pregnant, I never felt sick or anything. There were no complications at all, so I really don't know what could've been causing this. Ever since the 4th grade, I remember having this. It is not a hygiene issue, so I don't have any clue or explanation as to why this is happening and won't go away. Please help. Like I said, I have barely noticed allergic reactions to deodorants and some body lotions, could that have caused it since I had used these things over the years without thinking much about it? Any help will be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance.",
