The only thing different about this pregnancy is I'm high risk due to previous unexplained miscarriages and a slight tear in my uterus, but that has nothing to do with blood sugar levels!",

    "question": "I am almost 21 weeks according to my lmp, but 24 according to baby's growth on ultrasound. I scheduled my glucose test today, and they automatically scheduled me for a two hour test on Wednesday... I thought the first test was supposed to be only one hour?! I tried calling my doctor to ask why and they said its standard procedure for their office but I still don't understand?.. When I was pregnant with my daughter I never did anything other than the one hour, so why is this doctors standard procedure the two hour? Is anyone else's doctor this way?",
