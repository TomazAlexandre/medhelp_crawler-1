            "answer": "It is probably just a boil. Wash with rubbing alcohol and antibacterial soap\u00a0\u00a0and put e antibiotic ointment and bandage to help it heal. If it shows no sign of healing or starts to look infected (has red streaks coming off of it) go get it checked. Otherwise just give it time to heal, the worse it is the longer it will take to drain and heal. Good luck to you.Sissie",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Since it burst and discharges, it could be a boil. You can treat this by applying a warm cloth to the area. This encourages the pus to come to the surface, make a mouth and drain. Once the boil has drained, the area should be washed with antibacterial soap and an antibacterial cream applied and kept dry, bandaged and sterile.\u00a0\u00a0However, if you have any medical problems like diabetes, please consult a doctor, and do not wait for it to heal. Also if the boil appears to spread, the area around it becomes progressively red, the also consult a doctor. This may need incision and drainage.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

    "question": "it has been a week now since i have developed lumps that look like they are under my skin on my upper left thigh very close to the vagina. There seems to be a boil-type thing right next to the lump that kinda burst today and has been oozing out discharge that looked yellowish at first and later mixed with blood. The boil hurts when i walk because my underwear rubs against it. I have been checked for STDs recently but i have had a new sexual partner after that. It doesnt look like any of the STDs to me but i may be wrong. Any feedback/advise is greatly appreciated. Thanks to anyone who replies in advance.",
