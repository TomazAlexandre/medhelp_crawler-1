            "answer": "Hey :) I'm 16 and was diagnosed with type I diabetes on Aug. 8th, so i'm pretty new to it. My glucose levels were 7.5. I honestly think you have diabetes, but it could be something else. In type I, there is no family history. It's younger, leaner, active people, and no clue why we get it. 6.5 is a little high, but not much. Normal is between 5 and 6. But, when I'm high, My vision is like yours, like a tv not properly tuned. I can't concentrate at school, and I just want to sleep to make it feel better. I go to the restroom pretty much every hour, and I have to always have water with me.\u00a0\u00a0I think you may have something to worry about, but I'm not a professional doctor, I'm only 16 lol. but Good luck with the tests, I hope everything turns out okay, Hope I helped. :)",

            "answer": "Thank you for your reply. I'm not feeling exhausted any more but I'm still tired with funny vision and sleeping ten hours per night. I don't know if that's due to an illness or if I'm just the kind of person who will sleep that long given the chance! Normally if I'm off work for a while my sleep will even out to 8.5 - 9 hours though. Last night I went to the toilet five times:-( and the night before last I fainted on the way there. I'm not thirsty though I'm drinking what I normally would. Hopefully I just have a bad virus but if the worst does come to the worst then no doubt I'll be back for some advice.",

            "answer": "The fainting thing could be from it dropping too low, mines gotten down to 54 and I could barely function. Honestly, I would go see another doctor, soon. Have your regular doctor do tests again and if they come back the same, go to a different one and see what he says. I went to the doctor, told him my symptoms, they did my A1C hemoglobin level check, and it was 7.5. I was put on insulin that morning. I'm an active member of Color guard with the Band at my high school and because I didn't find out sooner, I was extremely dehydrated but I wasn't thirsty, It was just my body and that caused my blood sugar to raise up to the High 200's, low 300's.\u00a0\u00a0and That was causing my blurred vision. I'm no doctor, I'm only 16 lol. but I would definitely go and get rechecked if I were you, just to be on the safe side. My best friend is also diabetic and has been for years, and I've seen him in the hospital one too many times for not taking care of it. It's honestly a scary disease if You don't treat it properly. Best wishes to you. :)",

    "question": "Hi, I hope someone can help me. I've been feeling exhausted lately (11 hours sleep and still tired all day) my vision is 'snowy' like a tv not tuned in properly and my limbs ache. When I was at work my brain felt muddled and I had a low attention span. My bloods were drawn and the doctor gave me a sick note. Everything was normal except my blood glucose was 6.5 which the doctor said was the high end of normal but he still wants me to do a glucose tolerance test which is not for ten days. He doesn't think my symptoms match diabetes (I am urinating more but not loads and I have a dry mouth but not a great thirst.) Should I be worried about diabetes? There is no history in my family, I'm 29, female, on the light end of normal weight. Thanks for any opinions.",
