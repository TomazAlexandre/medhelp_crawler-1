    "question": "Hello,I am not a doctor (despite my screen name).I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at the age of 13 and have been told that recent symptoms may be related to it, but I am skeptical.\u00a0\u00a0I am in my 20's now and last year developed severe eye pain and dryness and was told after an ultrasound that my retinal nerve was inflamed.\u00a0\u00a0After prednisone treatment it has improved.\u00a0\u00a0But I have since experienced extreme shortness of breath, frequent hiccups, yawning (anything to get oxygen), numbness in hands and feet, fiery pain in heels of my feet, jolting eye movements, dizziness, occasional difficulty speaking and writing my name, I lose my balance in the shower when my eyes are closed (abnormal for me), have difficulty sleeping (mostly because I can't breathe), heart palpitations, and sexual issues/lack of sensation below.\u00a0\u00a0In the last month, I have seen a rheumatologist and a DO whom have both run blood tests and taken x-rays.\u00a0\u00a0Everything is reportedly normal and I was told I have anxiety and was put on celexa.\u00a0\u00a0I have a family history of fibromyalgia and diabetes but these have been ruled out.\u00a0\u00a0My husband suggested I see a neurologist and fears it might be multiple sclerosis.\u00a0\u00a0Should I?\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas as to what this could be?",
