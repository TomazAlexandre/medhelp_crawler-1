            "answer": "The low vitamin D is not a problem, just take a Vit D supplement and get out in the sun as often as you can but don't overdo it with the sun or the vitamin D tablets. Ask your doctor for a blood test to rule out thyroid problems but it could be quite a number of things including sensitivity to certain products you come into contact.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes",

I have been taking 50,000 twice a week for a month now and I am feeling a remarkable improvement. I can totally sympathize with you. I couldn't figure out what was wrong and thought it was emotional. I never realized the importance of Vit D. And, I even drank milk. But, I didn't get enough sunlight. I do wonder if my extremely low level is a symptom of something else. Best of luck.",
