            "answer": "Namaste,Cymbalta is an antidepressant in a group of drugs called selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs). Cymbalta works by restoring the balance of certain natural substances in the brain (serotonin and norepinephrine), which helps to improve certain mood problems.Cymbalta is used to treat major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. It is also used to treat pain caused by nerve damage in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy).If your provider prescribed it for you he/she must think that it will be beneficial for you and you should take it as prescribed.Second guessing your provider, which so many people in these forums do, can be at a minimum detrimental to your overall mental health.\"To see what is right, and not to do it, is want of courage or of principle.\" ConfuciusMichael(Jikan)",

Now my doctor is talking about taking shots for six months.I also take a lot of Oxycontin, Oxycodone, and etc. I would recommend that if you want to try Cymbalta, just have your liver enzymes checked before dosing, after three months, then check it as you wish. The anti-depression action does take about a month to kick in, so why take a potential health hazard and wait a month to see if it helps. The commercials warn about liver problems, just listen to the them. I'm switching to another drug that works and is safer next week.",
