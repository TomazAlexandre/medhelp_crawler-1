            "answer": "I have had this problem (and all of your others except diabetes) for years and years and had a barium exam which showed the opening from my stomach to my duodenum which joins the stomach on your right side just below the ribs was smaller than it should be, and food passes from the stomach to the duodenum through that opening as it is digested. This means in my case that I feel unwell in the stomach all the time because it doesn't empty fast enough.They said it could be because scar tissue had built up because of ulcers, or because I have duodenitis (another 'itis' which means they don't know but have to give us a name) which is inflammation of my innards in general. There are tablets which are supposed to make the food travel out of the stomach faster but they made me worse. That happens with most medicines I try because I'm drug sensitive. I guess it must be bothering you because you had it investigated, but if it doesn't make you feel bad leave it alone. I also had CT scan by the way and it didn't show up but my hiatus hernia did. The barium is the best and it doesn't hurt or anything.Kev",

    "question": "Today I found out I am having a problem with food staying in my stomach longer than usual. I already have diabetes, acid reflux, hiatal hernia and irritable bowel syndrome and would like to find out what new disease I could possibly have. I am doing more testing to find out if its temporary of chronic, but the doctor didn't mention any possible reasons. Any response?",
