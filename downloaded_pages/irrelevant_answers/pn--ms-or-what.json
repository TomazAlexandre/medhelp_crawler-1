            "answer": "Hi,Pins and needles sensation along with numbness indicates a nerve compression and peripheral neuropathy.Disc problems like you have mentioned in the lower back can give you these symptoms.Please make sure that you do not have a bad posture, also physical therapy,\u00a0\u00a0and heat and ice therapy to the affected area will help.The other possibility is peripheral neuropathy. Please get your blood sugar levels checked to rule out diabetes.It can also occur as a result of vitamin B deficiency. Please take B complex supplement and see if it makes you feel better.It does not look like MS as of now as there are no other symptoms and like you mentioned no remissions. Take care!",

            "answer": "thanks so much. i do have a routine blood test every year along with a pap and a mammogram even though i cant afford it and my sugar levels range between 90 and 98 which are higher than i would like but not high enough to cause nerve damage. i did have very high triglicerides (spelled very badly) but i was able to lower them to around 150 by switching everything to whole grains. i will pick up some b vitamins and see if that helps. thanks so much for your reply!",

    "question": "i have no insurance but supposedly make to much to get aid even though i can barely cover bills. about 11 years ago i got pins and needles along with numbness in my right foot. there were some horrible shooting pains also. at the time i had insurance and went to a bunch of different drs that gave me tests, back adjustments (yes i have disk problems), and shoe insoles. nothing helped and never a diagnosis. over the years the numbness increased to the point that my soles feel like i am wearing shoes even when barefoot. the left foot has the same problems now. the bottoms and top of my feet are pretty numb and a small patch on the outer side of my right calf is too. there are pains and burning sensations but no muscle weakness or balance issues. i make sure i walk at least 2 miles a day 5 days a week even if there is pain figuring its better to use the muscles. now my aunt has been diagnosed with ms and she thinks\u00a0\u00a0i might have it too. i have had this condition consistantly with no remissions and even though i dont have a clue whats wrong i doubt ms is the problem. anyone have a suggestion?",
