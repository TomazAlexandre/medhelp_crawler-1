I am sorry, I should have mentioned that it is only in and around my belly, that is in the center and sides. I do not have it in my thighs/legs/feet.Also, I have been reading a lot of forums since this pain started and I was wondering if this could be an early sign of pregnancy as well?Thank you in advance, and look forward to your reply.Regards,Puneeta",

            "answer": "Hi,Yes it is possible for peripheral neuropathy to manifest in the lower abdomen although usually it involves the extremities.Usually itching is seen in pregnancy; however it is possible that the tingly skin is due to pregnancy. Cold tingly skin is sometimes seen in early pregnancy. If your condition deteriorates please consult your OBGYN.",

            "answer": "Dear Dr. Noopur,Thank you for your reply.I went to the hospital today and got it checked. I cannot have any MRI/X-ray done as there are chances I am expecting but I got my\u00a0\u00a0blood test done and it seemed OK. Doctor has ruled out appendicitis, diabetes. I still have the pain but now it is more on right side of my stomach, unlike before when I was\u00a0\u00a0having it on both sides and the center. I am also feeling nausea since morning. Since I cannot have any medicines too, I can do nothing but wait till I find out if I am pregnant or not and if not then have an x-ray/MRI other tests done. Wish me luck.I am really scared...and thanks again for your valuable inputs.",

            "answer": "Hi,Please relax since all your tests have been fine. Nausea is very common in early pregnancy. Usually lemon, ginger and peach ice teas are known to help with nausea of pregnancy. Also make sure that your blood glucose levels do not fall too low. Eat light salty snacks at regular intervals.Please remain happy and cheerful. Always remember a happy mother gives birth to a happy baby. Good luck!",

    "question": "Hi,I am planning a baby and recently had an AI done a couple of weeks back. The results are yet to come back.However, I have been having a pin-***** like sensation all over my lower abdomen (centre and sides) along with lower backache. I went to my fertility doctor today and he did and ultrasound but the results were normal. He says it is not related to pregnancy in anyway. He has also taken a blood sample of mine and I will know the result on this Friday. However, this constant sensation is causing a lot of anxiety in me. The doctors in Japan are not very helpful in the sense that they do not discuss anything properly with the patient. My doctor also gives me a one word answer rather than explaining in detail inspite of the fact that I am worried like hell. I am afraid to get into any kind of health complications right now as it may have an impact on plans of having a baby because I am already 34. Kindly advice what can this be? It is not constant but happens every few seconds and sometimes it is light and at times very sharp stabbing sensation.",
