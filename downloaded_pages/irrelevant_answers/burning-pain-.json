            "answer": "I agree with RunningMom that it sounds like nerve pain.\u00a0\u00a0Nerve pain can be very difficult to treat, depending on the origin of it.Did the hospital give you any kind of diagnosis?\u00a0\u00a0They must have said something, right?\u00a0\u00a0Even if it's just follow up with your own doctor.Until you can see a doctor, or go back to a hospital ER or clinic, ice and ibuprofen can sometimes help as it brings down any swelling.\u00a0\u00a0If you have anything that's swollen and hitting the nerve, you may get a little relief with the ice and ibuprofen.\u00a0\u00a0But to get to the bottom of it, you definitely need to see a physician as soon as possible.",

            "answer": "Hello Mustang,Welcome to our Pain Mangement Forum. I am so very sorry to hear that you are in such pain and it is being ignored.Please make an appointment with your PCP to have this evaluated. An ER deals mainly with life threatening issues. Apparently they did not view your symptoms as life threatening...but that doesn't mean the cause should not be investigated.Burning pain and loss of sensation is usually associated with a nerve entrapment, nerve damage or a similar nerve issue. If your PCP is unable to diagnosis your pain than request a consult to a neurosurgeon or a neurologist. But please don't ignore it.There are multiple causes and reasons for neuropathic pain. I could not begin to guess. However in my opinion and experience, shingles would not be so wide spread and in several days a rash would appear. Diabetes can cause diabetic neuropathy but there could be other causes as Mummy3 suggested such as a spinal structural problem.If you cannot obtain an appointment with your PCP right away an Urgent Care Facility is the next best option. Whatever you decide I wish you the very best. Please let us know how you are doing. We will look forward to your updates with interest.Take Care,~Tuck",
