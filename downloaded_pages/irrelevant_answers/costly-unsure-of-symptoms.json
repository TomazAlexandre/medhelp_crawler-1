Also no one told me the LP was a long shot of an MS diagnosis, my Neuro told me it was clean and he is not sure of whats going on and think the spot are just from the headache and yet I still deal with pin and needles, spasm, the whites in corner of eyes as well some speech issues.",

            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Chronic headaches can cause white spots in the brain and so can smoking, alcoholism, diabetes and high BP.Since MS has been ruled out other possibilities like Fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and peripheral neuropathy need to be ruled out.Please discuss these possibilities with your treating doctor and take OTC vitamin supplements.Let us know if you need more information.",

As well my BP level is great base on what doctor told me. My Nuero is trying to rule out diabetes and since all my blood test result came back negative they all at a lost. I have gone through over 6 different prescriptions and less then 4 months. My Neuro had stated it maybe early MS since my symptoms are not just headache but fall more along those terms and I also notice im very irritated to heat as well my symptoms are or\u00a0\u00a0get worse.",
