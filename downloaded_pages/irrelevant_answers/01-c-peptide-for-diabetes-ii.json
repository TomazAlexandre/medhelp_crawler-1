            "answer": "There is no doctor responding on this board, only peers. Your C-peptide is very low which means you are not making sufficient insulin. I'm not familiar with that type of insulin; I assume it is a long-acting (basal) type that you take just once or twice a day? It sounds as if you might now also need bolus (before meals) injections.How are your post-prandial numbers (two hours after meals)?\u00a0\u00a0Some people just go to MDI's (multiple daily injections) and some go to the pump. I hear people get very good results from the pump and it is certainly easier to fit in your life though I think there is a learning curve to getting used to it. When you say your body is starting to show signs of deterioration that may be too far. You have been diagnosed for 16 years and that is a long time so you are experiencing the natural progression of your diabetes. I assume you use diet and exercise as well to control your blood sugar? If you want more information and want to talk to others on the pump (I'm on MDIs myself) you might want to check out these websites tudiabetes.com\u00a0\u00a0and diabetesforums.comZoe",

            "answer": "Zoe - I think Windchimes meant humulin insulin not huminsulin. Humulin is considered an intermediate acting insulin as its duration is 24 hours, but this can vary per individual. LANTUS, on the other hand, is considered long lasting as its duration is up to 36 hours.Windchimes - You kept your Humulin dose a secret so one can only assume you're at max and why your doctor is considering moving to the pump. This link will give an inside on pumps http://tinyurl.com/lvs7o6 . As far as pump problems, pumps generally behave themselves, but like other mechanical devices they can misbehave. Mechanical problems cannot be solved by giving more insulin. It's critical to recognize when the pump, infusion set, reservoir, or insulin is the source of high glucose. Just don't forget to use your glucose meter to test your glucose levels from time to time.",

    "question": "Hello Dr., in 1993, at 37 yrs age, I was diagnosed with Diabetes Type II, since then I have been taking the insulin injection (huminsulin), but this week my fasting C-peptide came out 0.1 and my Dr said that it is almost nill, and recommended I should go on insulin pump. I don't know how to take this information? Is it that now my body has started showing signs of deterioration, and I need to watch out for further/additional complications? Also, what are the complications/risks associated with using the pump?This discussion is related to/posts/show/370369.",
