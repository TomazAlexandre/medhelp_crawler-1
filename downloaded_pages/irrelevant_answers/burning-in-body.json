            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Generalized feeling of a burning sensation can be due to dry skin, hyperthyroid states, liver or gall bladder dysfunction, peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes or decreased sweating as in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. This would need a comprehensive investigation.Hyperthyroidism should be suspected in case of burning in eyes and hot and sweaty upper body. In females above 40 years it can be a symptom of menopause or premenopause. Peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes too should be looked into. Fibromyalgia is another possibility.It is unlikely to be a cancer as endoscopy would have caught it. Take care!",
