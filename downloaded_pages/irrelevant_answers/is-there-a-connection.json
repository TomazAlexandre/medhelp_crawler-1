            "answer": "Hi,Even though there are some patterns regarding symptoms in diabetes, people are still quite individual and may have entirely different, and sometimes, opposite , symptoms from what you expect. Very high blood sugars are associated with increased thirst but do not necessarily HAVE to coincide. Mood changes are also quite common, so I do agree your daughter should be formally tested for diabetes, and also other possible concerns that your doctor may discuss with you.The pupillary change is somewhat unusual and I have never had a patient complain of this in regard to blood sugar levels. Pupil sizes can change with emotion and excitement, and are not always perfectly symmetrical. If you notice a big difference I think you should have an eye exam just to make sure all is okay.As you said yourself, definitely not good to eat the candybar if it is doing that to your blood sugars. I am not in the habit of saying absoutely NO to many things even for people with diabetes, but I let it depend on how their body responds to some degree. And if your blood sugar shoots up that much, then it is telling you those foods are not a great idea.Feeling palpitations with either high or low sugars is quite normal. We speak mostly about the warning signs of low sugars because those are most immediately dangerous in terms of passing out etc, but they can happen at either end.Hope this helps, take care.",

    "question": "Hi, Thank you for reading this.I have diabeties and I'm wondering a few things.First, could my pupils be uneven because my Blood Glucose is to high? It seems that if my meter test is high I can tell the difference in my unevenness and even feel it. I'm in no pain though. If Im upset at all i notice this change two.Secondly, If I eat half a choc-bar and test 1/2 hour later My reading is 12.2, this means I should never eat that half doesn't it? Or is it normal for BG to rise high at first? Because sometimes 2 hours later my reading will be 6 something and I feel fine, but alot of ice cream will read 8.4 two hour later.And, Is it possible to be diabetic and not have massive thirst? I have thirst always after sugar but I'm asking for my daughter. Her cheeks go red, moody, tired, etc but no thirst. She has only been to see a doctor for her first test and it was medium high and I have to wait a month for his holidays.Finally, I can feel my heart pumping fast, or it feels like that anyways, if my sugar is high or low, if it's 4.2 I feel aweful but I thought I was suppose to get low, or?Thank you and have a great day :)",
