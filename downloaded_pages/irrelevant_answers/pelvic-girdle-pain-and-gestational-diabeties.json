            "answer": "I have SPD and they believe I have GD (I go on for the tolerance test this week to confirm). The pelvic pain shouldn't effect labor but the GD could as it can make the baby larger which sometimes leads to needing a c-section. I have to wear special braces for my girdle pain but they help a lot!",

            "answer": "I had gd with my first about 18 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0 Implications are that the baby can grow large if gd is not well controlled and there is a danger that it will be born with diabetes too! Also not good for you if it is not controlled as you'll feel tired thirsty exhausted and be more prone to yeast and water infections! Not great. This pregnancy I haven't developed gd but have had pgp to the extent of being unable to walk, roll over in bed and go up or down stairs. I saw a well qualified physiotherapist at that point (33 weeks) who examined me and determined the cause of the discomfort. My pelvis was not even as one of the sacroiliac joints had slipped. She manipulated it a very small amount and gave me exercises and I use a belt but I was able to walk again without pain almost instantly although not cured 100%. Definitely worth investing in! In terms of labour she advised me to birth standing up or on all fours as gravity will assist delivery. Also said to stay within your pain-free range to avoid further damage!",
