            "answer": "When a person gets hypoglycemic, they often sweat profusely, and if the sugar drops extremely low, there is sometimes a sort of coppery smell to the sweat. I don't know if this is the same as what you are describing, but it may not hurt to have a glucose tolerance test done rather than just a fasting glucose test so he can find out if his sugar drops too low when he eats. This could be happening if he eats large evening meals and then reacts by overproducing insulin.",

            "answer": "I myself have the same problem that I seat profusely all the time and it&#39;s really embarrassing. At night I sweat really really bad too. My wife gets upset because she says that it has some weird odor. Back to the sweating all the time, I go through 3 to 4 shirts everyday from sweating. It&#39;s hard because I have told my primary doctor and my neurologist about it and no one can give me any answers about it.",
