Without one, you're flying blind.\u00a0\u00a0Then until you can read up on low carb food preparation, cut all of the \"white foods\"; not reduce, cut!\u00a0\u00a0That means sugar, pasta, rice, potatoes of any kind, any starchy foods.\u00a0\u00a0If your grandfather is ambulatory, even a small walk is beneficial in reducing blood glucose levels.\u00a0\u00a0Kepp testing everyday, and with no cheating hopefully he'll see the levels decline.\u00a0\u00a0Beside diet, medication may be required to further reduce levels.The first couple of weeks of a low carb diet may be literally quite painful with hunger pains unlike anything felt before.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, some shakiness may be experienced as the body is use to functioning at super saturated glucose levels.\u00a0\u00a0But once he gets through that bumpiness, it pretty clear sailing after that.\u00a0\u00a0I wish him well.",

    "question": "Does anyone have good recipies and tips for an 81-year-old male to control diabetes?My grandpa broke his hip, and while in the hospital, they uncovered that he is diabetic. Apparently, his doctor has known for a while that he was insaline resistant and pre-diabetic, but \"didn't think it was a problem\". So we're trying to help my grandma (who is 73) to take care with her cooking when (if) he gets out of the nursing home.I appriciate all the help I can get! It's been stressful planning these meals around the holidays (diabetic-friendly, dairy-free, gluten-free meals are hard to come by).Thanks so much!",
