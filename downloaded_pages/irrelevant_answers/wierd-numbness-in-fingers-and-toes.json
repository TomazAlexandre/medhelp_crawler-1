    "question": "Wierd numbness in fingers and toesby Satpriya, 2 hours agoI have had the glucose tolerance test and I am clear of diabetes, my doctor has been treating me with vitamin B (thiamin) but I have not noticed any improvement. I, too have constant ache in the lumbar region and my back and knees suddenly give way on me all the time,\u00a0\u00a0I was treating my knee weekness with double dose magnesium and at first it helped a lot but now that doesn't seem to work anymore. Can my back and knee problems be related to the numb sensations I feel in my extremities?\u00a0\u00a0Should I just ignore these symptoms as those of aging( I am 62)?",
