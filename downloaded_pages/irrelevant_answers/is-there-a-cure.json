            "answer": "Don't take this the wrong way, I'm not attacking you personally but question the wording in your post.\"they are however doctors of nutrition and body chemistry\"Yes, one can receive a Doctorate of Science [DS]\u00a0\u00a0or a Doctorate in Public Health [DPH] from such schools as Harvard University. But not all doctors study this as it does not pertain to their studies.\"most doctors are never taught in medical school since they are learning more about how to dispense drugs.\"That's a huge speculation unless you're privy to every medical school class information taught in the world. Some doctors may dispense an Rx on a regular basis because either their lazy or their patient expects them too, some do it because their patient is argumentative or hasn't followed prior instructions, while others may first look for alternative treatments before issuing an Rx. My PCP falls into the latter arena. Generalizing all doctors into one bag is incorrect. It can be considered stereotyping.\"Does any one agree or disagree with what those folks are saying..\"What folks? Who are these \"folks\"? Are these medically trained folks? From where? If its some mumbo jumbo psuedo medical or psuedo scientific theory there are thousands in the supplement industry touting miracle cures that work on rodents and animals but unproven on humans. If it's being touted by a major medical university teaching hospital, I and many others, would like to read it for ourselves. A link or links to their web page would be helpful.\"the AMA and drug industry are milking a very profitable cow and not advocating anything at all to do with nutrition and corrective diets.\"Big Pharm yes, but what proof the AMA has their pockets in this? Its been said doctors, at times, get kickbacks/incentives for writing an Rx, and some for directing the Rx to specific pharmacies. Is it illegal? No its not. Is it immoral/unethical/civically wrong? You betcha?But isn't nutrition and corrective diets the patients responsibility to learn, understand, and follow on their own? Why must the patient lean on a doctor when its on the Internet? I have yet to hear or read a diabetes web site or doctor not advocating proper nutrition, daily exercise, and maintaining normal weight as the first step in diabetes control management. As a patient you have the right to choose another doctor, anytime, anywhere.",

            "answer": "I agree completely with WaveRider's comment.There are thousands of individuals and organizations willing to separate you from your money by pushing alternative medical cures for serious disease. Type II diabetes is fairly easy to understand--if certain blood test routinely exceed a specified diagnostic level you are a diabetic.Early on, if you implement good diatery habits, exercise, control your weight and avoid stress you may be able to control your diabetes without taking oral or injectable treatments.Its up to you, if you have diabetes you can play the denial game, however, you could end up like me needing a triple coronary bypass operation. That was something I could not deny.Good Luck,troytroy",
