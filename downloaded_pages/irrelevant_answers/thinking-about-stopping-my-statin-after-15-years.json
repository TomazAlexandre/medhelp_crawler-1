            "answer": "You are correct, there is a link between statins and risk of diabetes. That being said, the overall benefit of statins FAR outweighs their risk. There is a risk with any medication. I would make sure your thyroid level is ok (TSH) as this can elevate your cholestrol numbers. It may also be reasonable to give the statin a break if your diet and exercise routine are appropriate. I agree that you should discuss this with your doctor",

            "answer": "The problem is, cholesterol in your blood is accounted for by around 20% of what you eat. In some people, diet makes no difference whatsoever. The Liver can make its own fat molecules and send them into the blood inside lipoproteins. I think if you haven't had a problem in 15 years, it would be wise to probably stay on them. Who can say if they have prevented more serious problems or not, but is it worth the risk to find out? What if you stop them and your arteries develop plaque? Just my opinion, but maybe someone else will have their input. As a final comment, I stopped my statins for about a year, and I felt fine. Obviously I didn't see what was happening inside my arteries and after that year I had another heart attack.",
