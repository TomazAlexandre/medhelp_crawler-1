            "answer": "A negative brain MRI and neck MRA would rule out many of the major causes that can lead to your symptoms.If balance is an issue, you can check the vitamin B12 level in the blood, as well as a referral to an ENT physician to rule out inner ear causes.I agree with the neurology referral at this time.\u00a0\u00a0Nerve conduction studies can be done to see if there is peripheral nerve damage.\u00a0\u00a0Further blood studies looking for diabetes or thyroid dysfunction can also be considered.These options can be discussed with your personal physician, or in conjunction with the neurologist.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

            "answer": "Thanks for the reply. I failed to mention that I also get numbing feelings around my right eye, this is the usual side I would get a migrane but no pain. I'm also\u00a0\u00a0getting aching in Left side of neck.My bloods were done two weeks ago, glucose was noral as well as everything else, my thyroid was only slighlty elevated so that was discounted and my esr was 17. What do you feel might be going on should I be concerned about MS with a negative MRI?, and should I be concerned about SLE, my WBC count is always normal or slightly elevated so I thought not in the first instance. I also forgot to say that I have been having like a lump at the back of the throat sensation no difficulty in swallowing just the sensation, I've also getting a sore feeling throat and a bit hoarse but this comes and goes. I would appreciate your comments. Many Thanks ...",
