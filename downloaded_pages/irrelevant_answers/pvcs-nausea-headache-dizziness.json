            "answer": "In the absence of heart pathology, the symptoms you describe may very well be due to what is called 'vasovagal faintness.'\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, fright over one thing or another--including the great, visceral fear generated by physical sensations--causes a dip in blood pressure, which can be responsible for some of the effects you describe.If you have more heart tests coming up, it is possible that some abnormality may turn out to be responsible for your symptoms.But brace yourself for the possibility that nothing is physically wrong.",

            "answer": "hello,if you have been cleared on an echo, and nuclear stress, and if your ectopics have been diagnosed as benign, you may benefit from an anti- anxiety agent, or even an SSRI. Sometimes with me, when my PVCs are in their \"vicious cycle\", this causes all kinds of negative feelings and thoughts. The doctors may be able to give you something for your anxiety. Lord knows, I sure have plenty of anxiety along with the dreaded PVCs.Some people just seem to be able to tolerate them better than others. Unfortunately, I am not one of them. I take a .5 Klonopin once a day, and since my last PVC episode started, went on a low dose of prozac 10 mg once a day. I can truly relate to your anxiety.best to you",

            "answer": "Ordinary, benign PVCs are not 'fixable.'\u00a0\u00a0Once they appear, they are most likely the 'new normal' for your heart, and will be with you (maybe off and on) for the rest of your life.Since that is usually the case, it's what pvctom says:\u00a0\u00a0You treat the anxiety that you feel as a result of the odd heartbeat rhythms.The right person to see about this is a specialist who treats anxiety and panic, either a psychiatrist or a mental health counselor.\u00a0\u00a0Often--as in my case and in tom's--a little anti-anxiety medication is needed.",

            "answer": "Just as some people are born with or later develop defects--like allergies or food intolerance or psoriasis or diabetes--that turn out to require lifelong medication, so we can develop inadequate production of substances that are important for the functioning of our nervous systems.\u00a0\u00a0This has nothing--nothing at all--to do with will power or strength of character.Tendencies toward anxiety or panic often (very often) run in families, and it is now thought that in many cases they are as much genetic as other conditions like--again, for example--diabetes.At a certain point in life, some kind of switch gets turned on or off, and presto, all of a sudden you cannot make enough of a particular substance necessary for your good health.\u00a0\u00a0And you probably never will again.Thank goodness that medicines now exist for problems that used to shorten our lives or make them miserable to the end of our days.However, it would not hurt to talk with a psychiatrist to see if your anxiety is of a type that will respond to cognitive-behavioral therapy, for example.",
