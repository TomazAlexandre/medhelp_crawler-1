            "answer": "Oh hun. I cried heaps over this. It's my second pregnancy with gd. On the bright side it WILL be over when the baby is out and that first piece of choc cake tastes heavenly!What i did this time is get me some low sugar or sugar free treats that help me cope with the cravings. Do some research on which sweeteners are safe and then look for products containing those. Or you can bake something yourself.I allow myself one sachet coffee per day. They have a tiny amount of sugar and make me feel real good.With my gd, I can't take any carbs, even the healthy ones so i was on oral meds in first pregnancy and now i chose insulin injections.\u00a0\u00a0Are you managing your gd with diet alone? Please don't skip carbs. It may be a good idea to do a food diary a week before your next appointment so you get the best treatment for your needs.xoxo",

            "answer": "I was diagnosed early on as well, due to family history. I cried and had a tough time at first, but it has gotten very manageable now. Try subbing something healthy and sweet for the junkfood cravings. Have some fruit or even a peice of sugarfree gum. And be honest with your dietician. Mine has been amazing and so supportive! And make sure to keep an eye on bg levels after baby. Gd can turn into type 2 for up to 50 percent of women!",

It's all excess. We only developed a high carb diet via agriculture after we ate our preferred foods to near extinction. I do miss sweets so I use splenda and xylitol and nut flours. They aren't real flours from grain but finely ground nuts.",

    "question": "I found out a couple weeks ago that I have Gestational Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I'm having a pretty difficult time with this. I'm sticking to the diet for the most part but all I want are sweats. My biggest motivation is having a healthy baby. That's what is getting me through it. But I broke down last night and started sobbing. I don't even want to eat anymore.\u00a0\u00a0And of course now that I can't eat the food I want to, I'm getting invited to things that have to deal with the kinds of food I'm not allowed to have. So I just make up reasons that I can't go.\u00a0\u00a0Only 7 1/2 weeks to go though.Anyone else going throug this as well?",
