            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without knowing the relevant clinical details or a detailed clinical evaluation, it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include stress/ anxiety, low blood sugar, micronutrient deficiencies, neuropathy, hormonal/ endocrine abnormalities, infections, inflammations etc. I would suggest getting this evaluated by a primary care physician initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought. For adequate management of diabetes/ blood sugar levels, it is advised to consult an endocrinologist.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
