            "answer": "Hi,Your urinalysis appears to be normal except for the presence of the increased WBC which may signfiy an infection. With regards to the diagnosis of cervical cancer, a pap smear will be able to determine the presence of abnormal cells. Also , cervical cancer in its early stages may not present with symptoms.A pap smear is indicated if you have been sexually active.In your case, this may seem like an infection.What are your symptoms? What was the indication for your urinalysis?Do you have any abnormal vaginal bleed? Any changes in the menstrual cycle?",

            "answer": "Hi,I suggest you seek consult with an internist.You may need oral antibiotic therapy for your symptoms.Your urine shows increased white blood cells and you present with increased urinary frequency ( you urinate my times a day) .I suggest that you have a complete assessment done including assessment of your thyroid hormones ( increase in hair fall and tiredness) and blood sugar to rule out diabetes.You may be urinating often due to increase in water intake.However, do continue taking adequate amount of water.This may sound like an infection.Do keep us posted regarding your physician's advice.",
