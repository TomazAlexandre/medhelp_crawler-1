            "answer": "Sounds like she may be having migraine headaches. Many people with migraines notice triggers that can start them off. Maybe hunger is one of hers; stress could be another. There are variety of medications available for children with migraines. The specialist to work with in this area would be a pediatric neurologist with an interest in headache. Good luck.",

            "answer": "Another possibility is that she is dealing with hypoglycemia. Low blood sugar can cause bad headaches. Some people over-react to carbs that they eat by producing too much insulin, which causes blood sugar levels to drop after eating and sometimes also to drop if a long period of time has expired between meals. So headaches either before a meal or after a meal could be a symptom of blood sugar lows. You may want to ask her doctor to test her glucose tolerance.",

    "question": "Hello, my daughter has been having headaches for years, and the doctors would always tell me that it is from stress, but lately I've\u00a0\u00a0noticed that she starts having a headache right after she eats or if she is hungry. I thought it was from carbohydrates, and started a diary to keep a track of the meals she's had the days when she had headaches. But it seems that her headache can come from nowhere, and in addition to that she feels like vomiting sometimes, but she never really does vomit. I have a scheduled appointment with her doctor next week, but I would like to have some feedback on what tests I need to ask for (I am very afraid she could have diabetes). Please let me know what could be going on.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
