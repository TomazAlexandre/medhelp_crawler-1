            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!This could be due to pressure at the wrist joint causing the median nerve to get compressed. This is called carpel tunnel syndrome. The nail beds turning blue is due to reduced blood supply, which can be avoided by keeping the hands warm. A pressure at the wrist too can reduce the blood supply.Another possibility is diabetes causing peripheral neuropathy. Hypothyroidism and obesity too can cause pressure symptoms at the wrist.I think you should discuss this with your doctor and try and find the cause. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
