            "answer": "Hi,Since when have you noticed the spots? What colour are they? Do you remember wearing any tight clothing? It could have caused some bruises / petechieae / ecchymosis. What is your age? Wait for a few days, wear lose clothes, apply some soothing cream over the area. If they still persist consult your physician for a clinical evaluation.",

            "answer": "I noticed them just two days ago. (I am 24 and hispanic and have diabetes; type 1 and 2 just got lucky I guess 5'2 and 130) The spots on my left breast are about the same colour as my skin tone yet a little darker kind of like freckles. The spots on my right breast were the colour of the ones on my left yet because I picked at it they look darker, like black. I am thinking that they are now darker b/c they are bruised.",

    "question": "Last night I noticed on both of my breast some dark spots. When I looked at them closely I noticed that they looked like they had maybe blackheads in them so I tried to squeeze them out and when I did it almost seemed as though they were either moles or something. Never before have my breasts had any pain and I do not have any bumps on my breast, but of course I just want to make sure that everything is ok. Has any one had this experience or know what it is?",
