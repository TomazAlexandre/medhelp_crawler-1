            "answer": "Thank you about the information about animals and gluten.\u00a0\u00a0I actually had that part figured out, since my furball developed food allergies.\u00a0\u00a0Since I am gluten intolerant, it wasn't really too hard to understand that she has the same food issues that I do.\u00a0\u00a0Sure enough, gluten was exactly what the problem was.\u00a0\u00a0Eversince I switched her food to a very low carb diet with no grains in it, she has done well.\u00a0\u00a0She doesn't scratch so long and hard, like she used to.Before I wised up and learned that spelt was simply just a non-hybrid and natural form of wheat and that it still has gluten in it, I would go to make some toast with this spelt bread.\u00a0\u00a0Before I ever got the butter on it, the cat was trying to take the bread away from me.\u00a0\u00a0And, she usually has much better manners than that.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed that I wasn't stopping at one or two slices of this bread myself.\u00a0\u00a0I wised up and didn't buy any more of it.I used to give the cat canned food with gravy.\u00a0\u00a0Big mistake.\u00a0\u00a0Now, I know why she craved the kind with gravy so much.\u00a0\u00a0I don't buy that brand of cat food for her anymore.\u00a0\u00a0I buy a non-commercial brand for her at a small and local pet food store.\u00a0\u00a0They have very little of anything else for the dogs and cats other than the special foods.The cat used to scratch all of her fur off of her ears.\u00a0\u00a0She isn't doing that anymore.\u00a0\u00a0She still scratches a little, but I think a more manageable amount.\u00a0\u00a0She doesn't scratch her ears to the point of being naked and raw anymore.Now that you mention it.\u00a0\u00a0I do have type O blood, too.",

    "question": "I was hospitalized myself for the first time ever with renal failure back in September.\u00a0\u00a0To this day the nephrologist hasn't been able to figure out what the cause of the renal failure was or why the kidneys are only almost back to normal, but won't quite get to normal.\u00a0\u00a0I also have Oral Allergy Syndrome, GERD/IBS, Celiac,\u00a0\u00a0MCS and asthma and possibly CFS/FMS.\u00a0\u00a0I've been reading some information about hursutism and its connection to the cortisol produced by the adrenal glands.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know about what a common connection to all these disorders that would explain the connection to the kidney insufficiency that I still have?\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if it makes a difference, but what ever is going on is clearly affecting the right kidney more than the left kidney, since that is where I still get the most kidney pain.",
