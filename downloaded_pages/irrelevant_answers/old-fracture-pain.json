            "answer": "Hello and Welcome to MedHelp's Pain Management Forum. I am glad that you found us but sorry to hear about your pain.You are young to be experiencing arthritis but it is common to develop arthritis in old injury or fracture areas. I assume that is how they are treating your pain.Have you had an x-ray? If not I would suggest that you request one. If is shows nothing or something appears suspicious then an MRI may offer better information. I would not assume that it is the old injury causing your pain without supporting medical evidence.If the medication you have been prescribed in not controlling your pain then don't be afraid to ask for a change....something that will ease it.Please keep in touch and let us know how you are doing. I wish you the very best.Take Care,~Tuck",
