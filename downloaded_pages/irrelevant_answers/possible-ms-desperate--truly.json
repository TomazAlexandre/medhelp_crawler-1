            "answer": "Again, I just told some one else- Lyme Disease testing is essential through a reliable lab. There are labs that specialize in tick borne diseases, one in Palo Alto California, where your blood can be sent.Your symptoms are all on the Lyme disease list.\u00a0\u00a0Tick bites are often not seen, as ticks can be the size of a poppy seed and climb the body to the genitals, scalp, and other unseen areas. Lyme Disease causes a multitude of symptoms up to 75+.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor's find it next to impossible to diagnose as lab testing is so unreliable it should be based on a clinical diagnosis. But most Md's can't figure out what is going on . There are Lyme literate Md's that are wise beyond most.\u00a0\u00a0Lyme can mimic ALS, MS, Fibro and many,many more. It is the\u00a0\u00a0fastest growing infectious disease surpassing Aids in the U.S.\u00a0\u00a0There is reliable info out there lymenet, truthaboutlymedisease, ilads and more. Pleaes Trust me this needs to be ruled out by a reliable lab.",
