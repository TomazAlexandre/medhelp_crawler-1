            "answer": "Hi there. You may be feeling numbness in the last toe due to foot compression from tight shoes, casts etc or tarsal tunnel syndrome. There may have been a trauma to the foot, peroneal nerve irritation, sciatica due to lumosacral nerve root compression from prolapsed disc. Systemic disorders like peripheral neuropathy from diabetes, hypothyroidism or vitamin B12 deficiency, raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, or worse multiple sclerosis. Check with a neurologist after eliminating simple causes like tight shoes. Treatment would be according to the cause. Drugs like amitryptiline, gabapentin, gabapentin etc may be required.Take care and regards.",
