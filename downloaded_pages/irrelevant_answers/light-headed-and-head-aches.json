            "answer": "A lack of proper blood supply to the head could be causing this problem.While you should ask the doctor if :A) ferritin and blood iron testing is in order to be sure you aren't iron deficient (deficiency with symptoms can happen even if it has not affected a complete blood count yet- happened to me with tiredness and increased shortness of breath and worse tachycardia than usual for me if I recall correctly)B) brain MRI or CT scan, given your headaches and light headed feelings, would be in order andC) if you have a history or have high bad cholesterol and or high triglycerides, if a doppler of your carotid arteries in your neck would be in order to make sure there is not a blockage:it might have to do with intolerance with being in an upright position or standing.\u00a0\u00a0See a forum where many of us with orthostatic intolerance from a dysfunction with our autonomic nervous system post:http://www.medhelp.org/forums/Dysautonomia-Autonomic-Dysfunction/show/266Low blood volume, a drop in blood pressure with standing- these are things that can cause headache and light headed feelings where you have to put your head down (or sit/lay down) to keep from blacking out.Justafriend has an excellent idea about low blood sugar as well- you might ask your doctor about a fasting blood sugar test and also, a diabetes blood test called HgA1c, a test which gives the doctor a picture of how your blood sugar has been doing for the last three months, I believe.",
