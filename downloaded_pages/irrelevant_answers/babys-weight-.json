            "answer": "Baby's size has more to do with what you eat than how much you or the daddy weighed. Try making sure your portions of carbs are limited. I know it helped me when they had me start using the gestational diabetes diet even though I don't have it.",

            "answer": "Yes you and your patners weight has a bearing on baby's size. I was 8lb 5oz at 42 weeks and my hubby was 8lb 15oz at 36.5 weeks. We have 4 boys together and they were 7lb 15oz, 8lb 15oz,\u00a0\u00a09lb 15oz & 8lb 2oz in that order. I am currently due in March and they say baby is looking like it will be 8-9lbs. With my last 3 pregnancies I have gained 25lbs or less and it didn't effect their size. At 31weeks I have only gained 12lbs and baby is already 4lbs. While your baby won't likely be 12lbs I wouldn't expect a 6-7lb baby either",

        {
            "answer": "While how much you and your partner weighed at birth has some effect on how much your baby will weigh. Also look at if you have older siblings and their birth weight. I'm the last of 4, and weighed the most. My siblings weighted 5 lb 7 oz, 6 lb 12 oz, 7 lb 6 oz and I was 9 lbs. My first was 6 lb 1 oz my second was 7 lb 13 oz, and my baby due in March doesn't feel as heavy as her brother, but we will see.",
