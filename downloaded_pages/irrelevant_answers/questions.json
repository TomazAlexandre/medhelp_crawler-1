            "answer": "Sheri1963, Dr. Mark's comment about hyperthyroidism increasing insulin resistance is interesting. I take 1500 mg/day Metformin for insulin resistance -- it has successfully cleared up my acne and regulated my periods. Recently, however, I experienced hyperthyroid symptoms -- heart palps, shortness of breath, anxiety, etc. -- from Synthroid/T3 overtreatment, and it suddenly seemed like the Metformin just stopped working! After discontinuing the T3 and lowering my Synthroid dose, the hyperthyroid symptoms have lessened in frequency and severity, and the insulin resistance seems to be under control again with the same dose of Metformin. Maybe this is what was happening with you, too...A TSH of 0.02 is, indeed, pretty low. You should be aiming for a TSH around 1.0. Good luck!",

            "answer": "IN 1989 after the birth of my last child I began having issues with thyroid. Within 2 years I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's and Papillary Carcinoma of the right lobe of my Thyroid. I had 2 surgeries to remove both lobes and had my 6 week wait for radioactive iodine isotope. 1st yr follow up great, 5 year follow up great (but systems went crazy and was hospitalized)....now here we are almost 16 years later...Last June I began having problems with my TSH being elevated, my endo from previous yrs had always said my TSH was never to be any higher than .01 and I always had yearly Thyroid globulin tests. SO TSH last June was at 10 (I think)...I know for sure tooo high. I struggled and argued (as I have no health insurance) with docotrs from the \"free clinic\". Recently I had been out of my Levoxyl and had grown so tired of being told I don't know diddly about my own body. In just 4-5 weeks my TSH went to 180.17....I also had a WBC of over 17,0000 which seemed to be from a neglected bladder infection that went into my kidneys(I kept asking for help about my urine being so bad but was ignored) anyway I was hospitalized and assigned to a doctor who is argued with me and absolutely REFUSED to DAW my LEVOXYL as I am not able to take synthroid or any other generics out there (been there done it and it wasn't good!) Finally another doctor took over the Levoxyl issue and I was given it DAW.....I have been on that for 16yrs ! My question is when they did blood work they did a TgAb and\u00a0\u00a0not having a thyroid I am assuming that there should be no antibodies around for the thyroid....the level came back at 20 and I have huge concerns that antibodies are present as they are genetically altered from my Hashimotos....Could my cancer be back?? I have gone 6 weeks for body scans without my Levoxyl and my TSH has never been that high....I am very concerned.....actually very scared, this is a female issue on my paternal side also 2 other cousins have had the same cancer since I have. I would appreciate any help as I am just out of the hospital and have to wait until 9/11 to see my new doctor...HELP please!!!! This time has really flared my fibromyalgia into extremes also...pain in my spine is unbelievable....Please help!",
