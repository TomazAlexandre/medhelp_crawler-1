            "answer": "Originally I thought they were scratches because the oral sex was very rough and his teeth were hurting me.But that doesn't explain why after a 1 month and a half the redness of the scratch is still there.Midday today the center is a dark spot that suggests its getting dry, but around it is reddish which suggests the redness might be getting bigger tomorrow again. I check it many times the whole day everyday, and it gets dry in midday and late afternoon.But I'm sure tomorrow morning the whole thing will be reddish again because of the erection I have every morning.And like I said it's been more than a month now, and it's back and forth to dry and reddish like scratch or lesion.",

What I meant was AT THAT TIME, I didn't want to get checked for diabetes because there's so many things going on in my life that only added to my fear.I will be travelling 125 kms tomorrow to go to a doctor and get checked for that.Thanks again.",

    "question": "Hi, Good day. I'm 34 years old, male.On Oct. 22, I received oral sex from a friend, who later told me he has herpes. At the time we had sex he has no symptoms, though I know that rules out nothing. Anyway, the oral sex lasted for about 5 to 10 minutes. The way he did it was very rough and very fast that I had to stop him because it was hurting me.The following morning I noticed small reddish marks that looks like scratches on one side of the head of my penis. One is oval and one is more vertical. They're visible but very small. No liquid discharge or pain or ichiness. And at that time, no white bumps.Since then, these 2 scratches seem to increase in size that they're connected. It has a dried up dark patch on the center, but a little reddish on its sides.For awhile I thought it's starting to dry up, especially when I don't get an erection for a a few days. Then it gets slightly bigger after I get an erection. And I can't really control my erection especially every morning.And the last time I masturbated, there were 2 very small white spots (but they're very small I have to look really close to see them). These white spots appear like 8 hours after I masturbate, and then disappear later in the day. So I'm worried about maturbating because they might reappear.So I'm guessing, every time I get an erection (which is every morning) or masturbate (which is once a week) it gets worse.Now it looks like a slightly bigger patch, but the center looks like... you know when a wound dries up, its a little hard and dark on the center. That's how it looks like, while around it is the same type of scratch when it started, as if the wound is increasing. And when I showered this morning I noticed on the other side of the head of my penis, another very small scratch, not exactly a wound, but its reddish. After a few hours it's almost dry, but the very tiny mark is still there. I'm guessing this will also increase when I get another erection?I try not to masturbate but I can't control my erection (no white spots after erection, just the size of the wound seem to increase very slightly, with the center dried up).Questions:1. What could I possibly have? Is this STD or herpes?2. Does herpes lesions or scratches increase due to erection?2. Why does the wound take a long time to dry up completely? Its now been 1 month and a half.3. I am also worried I might be diabetic. Last year my doctor advised me to get checked for this, not for anything else but because of my family history (my uncle died from it and my aunt have it now). I don't get checked because I'm scared. So I don't know if this is connected. Should I worry about this?",
