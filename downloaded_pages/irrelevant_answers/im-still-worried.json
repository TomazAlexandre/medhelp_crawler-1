They will catheterize (sp) you and this will check your bladder and kidneys. I had it done before, and it wasnt too bad. You have been letting this really bother you for too long now. I am sure that you are ok! But if you still feel like something, go see a specialist!!! Good luck with moving!!!!",

            "answer": "Truthfully I'm not sure what else could make you pee unless it was your bladder. Men and women, as we all know, have different set ups and causes of stuff.Well if you don't know Prostatitis is a male thing where the prostate has an infection or is swollen and can cause urinary problems. He gave me a urine test which came out completely clean. Then the unfun part..digital exam..and he said he couldn't feel anything that was off. Then they did a quick ultasound of my bladder and nothing was there left over. All I have had is a little backache..a symptom..and a tiny bit of pain the urtethra area combinesd with off and on trouble getting started. There was no frequent urination with me. So he guess Prostatitis and said maybe my stomach meds stopped my urination. He said to see what happenes off of them and if it is still there, to take 4-6 weeks of anti-biotics. Well my main problem is that the pamphlet he gave me and the stuff I looked up said that the only way I'd be taking anti-biotics is if there was infection in the prostate. It may not show up in the urine but you can massage the prostate and test what comes out after. Well he never did that. There is such thing as stressed induced, non-bacterial prostatitis but he is telling me it could be either and to see what happens. To me I don't want to take 4-6 weeks of an anti-biotic if nothing is in there and all I have to do is get my anxiety and prostate back into shape. (there is too much info to go into about all this) So I'm left with hoping it goes away...it really isn't bad...or taking weeks of pills that may be unnecessary",

            "answer": "No, my doc wanted me to go because everytime I peed in the doc's office it showed that I had a UTI. which I had no other symptoms. So, she said just go and get it checked. there was nothin wrong. They catherized me and took it right from my bladder. they said it just could something stupid why it says that at the doc. sorry tmi- like wiping wrong or from having sex). Anyway, I did feel better after I went. The urologist would be able to test you for stuff and be able to tell you a lot more than your regular doc. Let me know what happens if you go.",

            "answer": "Though stress is the usual cause, have you been checked for diabetes?I was just diagnosed with borderline Type 2 and my main symptoms were frequent urination, along with severe hypoglycemic attacks.Just so your not alarmed, I've always had to urinate more frequently then others(43 years)....docs just said it was overactive small bladder and \"nerves\"..I can't leave the house without going and I'm a real pain in the kester to travel with.Now, with the diabetes starting, I'm going sometimes 3 times an hour if I drink more then a cup of liquid.Other causes besides stress, UTI's, and diabetes are, Interstitial Cystitis (chronic inflammation, I had it for about an year back in my twenties) kidney disease, medications (diuretics) and weakened muscles of the bladder, urethra and pelvic floor. If it doesn't get better in the next 2 weeks, it might be a good idea just to have it checked out with an ultrasound (cystits) and maybe a fasting glucose test.Be well.",

A UTI, kidney infection, diabetes, and bladder cancer would have been detected at the doctors office.\u00a0\u00a0You also do not exhibit any of the other symptoms of these diseases.\u00a0\u00a0You DO, however, present with signs of stress and anxiety.",

            "answer": "Urinalysis does not rule out diabetes or all kidney disease, infection. I've had at least 9 urinalysis done in both the ER and the lab over the last 6 months. Not one picked up glucose. It was my continual high Blood glucose tests and symptoms that peeked the doctors interest. The only way you can get an accurate diagnosis is to do more then one blood test, followed with fasting plasma glucose test (FPG)\u00a0\u00a0and then usually followed by an Hemoglobin A1c test. My Blood glucose levels were only 111 to 116 (normal 70 to 100) but my FPG's were 146 and 154. My A1c was 7.8%, in otherwords, I am pre-diabetic. My daughter had severe kidney sepsis\u00a0\u00a0requiring hospitalization and surgical stent placement and her urinalysis was normal.Like I said, it's most likely stress, but if it continues, see your doctor for further testing.",
