            "answer": "Hello,If periods of exertion cause the trembling and spasms in your left arm, then it could be due to narrowing of blood vessels or may be due to calcium deficiency or sometimes cervical spondylosis. Sometimes parathyroid disorders may also cause similar symptoms. You may consult a doctor if symptoms persist. Also, it is essential that you quit smoking if you are a smoker.",

            "answer": "Hi,These symptoms can be due to excessive stress. However it is important to rule out other possibilities like nerve compression as in carpal tunnel syndrome, peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes, thyroid dysfunction and B 12 deficiency. The possibility of peripheral vascular disease also needs to be ruled out.This requires further evaluation so I will suggest you to see your GP.Thanks",
