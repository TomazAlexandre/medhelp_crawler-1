            "answer": "Hi,Respectfully , I disagree with the\u00a0\u00a0theory that high protein diet will raise BG.The reason that your BG raise after you eat the so called High protein bars because actually those bars contain a fairly large amount of sugar which obviously will raise your BG. Please double check the amount of sugar in those bars. I eat so much protein all days long, and I have NEVER have my BG raised. My hbA1C is consistenly less than 5.6% for the last 12\u00a0\u00a0months , I have been a 20 year plus T2, for the last 18 months I don't need any Diabetes Meds nor insulin shots. Please read this book: Diabetes Solution by Dr. Richard Beirnstein.Good luck",

            "answer": "I believe the original posted editorial is based upon personal experiences. Not everyone reacts the same with certain foods, or food groups. The liver converts approx 58% of consumed protein into carbohydrates. As most know carbs are broken down into glucose and may cause elevated blood sugar levels in t2 diabetics. This may be what Wookie is experiencing, the sugars and simple carbs in energy bars causing blood sugars to elevate way above normal.However, as I mentioned earlier not everyone is the same. I have a high protein diet which does not elevate my blood sugar levels. I also do not consume energy bars or energy drinks whatsoever. My protein comes from natural organic sources not imitation sources.Lastly, I must disagree with last poster. Metformin does not \"effectively cure level 2 diabetes.\" At the present moment there is no cure for t2 diabetes. With most people Metformin does help to lower blood sugar levels, not all but most.",

            "answer": "I don't think there is a cure for T2 at this point, maybe some day though (we can hope!).\u00a0\u00a0Metformin does help some, but I took it when I was DX but still had fastings in the 130 range.\u00a0\u00a0When I went off of it I didn't see a difference; though my stomach felt much better. I was only on 1000mg/day and I've read that 1500mg is the effective dosage.\u00a0\u00a0I may try it again in higher doses depending on what my next A1C is.Not only did I stop eating protein bars daily I also reduced the amount of meat and peanut butter I was eating.\u00a0\u00a0I was using both when I felt hungry.\u00a0\u00a0After just over a week of doing this my fasting numbers have come down and I'm see numbers in the 100-120 range even 2hr PP.\u00a0\u00a0I have woken up and been at 118, and then seen a 108 right before lunch.\u00a0\u00a0This is with diet and exercise only.",

    "question": "I was DX over a year ago with an A1C of 12.4.\u00a0\u00a0I worked on diet and added exercise and my last A1C a month ago was 6.4.\u00a0\u00a0I'd like it lower so I started looking at what I eat etc.\u00a0\u00a0I just added the calorie counter to my phone so I can really see how many calories I'm eating per day.\u00a0\u00a0What I did notice, and since have changed, is that I was eating too much protein.\u00a0\u00a0My BG levels had crept up to 150 and I had started eating these low carb high protein bars as snacks.\u00a0\u00a0Once I stopped eating those my BG levels came down to the 130's.\u00a0\u00a0I have since reduce protein amounts and I'm seeing fasting numbers in the 120 and under range.Any one else experience higher BG levels with too much protein?",
