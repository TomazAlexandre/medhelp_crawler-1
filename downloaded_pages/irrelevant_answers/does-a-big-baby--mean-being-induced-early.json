If you have Gestational diabetes you might make a baby to big for your pelvis but if you control your diet you wouldnt. Our bodies are made to fit a baby through the pelvis and birth canal.",

    "question": "I will be getting an ultrasound at my 36 week appointment (next week) to determine the size of the baby. Everytime I do an ultrasound, they always mention how big she is. ( her femur measures 2-3 weeks ahead)Will they induce me early if baby is too big? Or can I ask to be induced early because she is too big?I want to deliver vaginaly, but if she's close to 10lbs, I'm going to be open for a c-section. The bigger my belly gets, the more afraid I am to give birth lolAny experiences with this??",
