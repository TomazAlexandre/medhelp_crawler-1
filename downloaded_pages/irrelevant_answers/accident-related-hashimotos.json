            "answer": "Hashimoto's is an autoimmune disease and I would doubt that an accident of that nature could cause it, however, I'm not a doctor;\u00a0\u00a0being the first in your family to have an autoimmune is not unheard of - I have a son who was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes (another autoimmune) at the age of 10 and we had absolutely NO diabetes in either my or my husband's families.\u00a0\u00a0Alas - over the past 5 years, MY family has had 5 more members come up with diabetes and 2 of us with hashimoto's, plus my 34 yr old daughter was diagnosed with lupus last year and *I* also was diagnosed with pernicious anemia a couple of years ago.\u00a0\u00a0All of these things are autoimmune diseases............All of that said - the pituitary gland is located at the base of your skull and I would suspect that an accident such as you had, COULD cause pituitary problems, so you might want to get your pituitary function tested........Maybe some of the other members will have some info............hm -- interesting thought.",

I have always had constipation. Also, my temps as a child were in the low 97s. The doc said that must have been my norm. Nothing about Hashi was mentioned then.Have I always had Hashi?

            "answer": "I saw my endo today, so I got to ask a bunch of hard-to-google questions.He was quite adamant that we are not born with Hashi's...it develops.\u00a0\u00a0However, he also said that it's quite possible that I've had antibodies for the past twenty or thirty years, and it took until a few years ago to cause symptomatic hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the destruction of the thyroid goes like gangbusters, sometimes the antibodies just slowly eat away at the thyroid for decades.\u00a0\u00a0So, there's no predicting.Also, the antibodies usually do go into remission after the thyroid is completely \"dead\", even if the thyroid tissue is still present.\u00a0\u00a0As he added, they don't really test antibodies on a regular basis since the results (after initial diagnosis) add no useful clinical information, just cost.Ahhh, and stress?\u00a0\u00a0He has become convinced that stress is a major factor in triggering all autoimmune disease.\u00a0\u00a0I know stress is powerful stuff, but I am surprised to hear this.\u00a0\u00a0He did say no one knows for sure, but he has to have seen a lot of autoimmune disease, so I have to respect his opinion.Tamra, I think I've had a somewhat underperforming thyroid all my life, too.\u00a0\u00a0I was a chubby kid (back when kids weren't couch potatoes, but spent all day outside running around), my mother always said my temp was below normal, I've always been sensitive to cold, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Except now that I'm euthyroid, it's 101 outside, and I can't stand it!!!\u00a0\u00a0The antibodies slowly destroy your thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0It often takes years for them to destroy enough for you to develop symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I think, in the last couple of years, you've just reached that critical point.\u00a0\u00a0Before that, you still had enough thyroid function to keep you going.\u00a0\u00a0Now you no longer do.Oh, and the really good news (it's all relative when it comes to thyroid!), he agrees with me that my thyroid has probably given up the ghost...dead, but not gone.\u00a0\u00a0I think this is good because it means I am now on total hormone replacement, and we should no longer be chasing a moving target.\u00a0\u00a0My labs have been consistent since January.\u00a0\u00a0No more ups and downs.\u00a0\u00a0Party time!\u00a0\u00a0;-)",

            "answer": "Wow! Thanks so much for this post. Now I do realize that I've been Hashi for many, many years. I thought that once you get it, it destroys your thyroid for a few years and then you rely on replacement drugs.I always slept through my third period class in high school, despite the fact that I went to bed on time. I've always struggled with weight. Either I was skinny or 15-25 pounds over weight. When I was in college, my boyfriend took me to see a popular stand up comedian in Vegas. I slept through his whole act. My boyfriend was so mad at me. Sometimes I would get so tired, and couldn't stay awake.But what I'm feeling now is a train wreck. Really, I think my Hashi hasn't destroyed my thyroid yet. I wish it would hurry up.Thanks for clarifying!:) T.",

    "question": "Hi there everyone. I have an important question that I am hoping someone has knowledge of. Here is my short story.... Back in November, I was in a major accident and rear ended at 60mph from a full sized truck(see pics in profile) Shortly after I started having weird symptoms, come to find out I have Hashimotos, and a small nodule on my left lobe. I had a FNA biopsy that showed suspicious, but am getting a second opinion.Has anyone seen any research that there is a correlation between whiplash/stress and Hashimotos or any autoimmune disorder? I have no thyroid issues that run in my family, and was healthy before the accident?Thanks!Fuel",
