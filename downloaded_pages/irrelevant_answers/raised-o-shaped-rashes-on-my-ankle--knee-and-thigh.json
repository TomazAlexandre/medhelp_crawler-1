            "answer": "Hello,For your symptoms, lichen planus should be ruled out. Lichen planus is an inflammatory disease that affects the skin and the oral mucosa, and presents itself in the form of papules(flat spots) or rashes. It is a papular eruption characterized by its violaceous color.Treatment is available only on prescription and consists mainly of steroids,retinoids,hydroquinone and phototherapy.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Hello and welcome!I cannot confirm anything without an external examination. There can be several causes of these reddish purplish rashes .The common causes are allergic purpura .It is a form of vasculitis in which there is inflammation of the small arterial vessels in the skin, kidneys, and intestinal tract and purple spotted skin rash. It often develops after a recent viral or bacterial infection of the respiratory tract and may be an abnormal reaction of the immune system to the infection. The other possibility is Lyme disease. In this condition there may be rash before the onset of fever. The rash is circular and called erythema migrans. Other possibility is southern tick associated rash illness .It is best to get it seen by a dermatologist. A clinical examination and investigations like platelet count may be needed. Do keep us posted.Take care and best regards!",

            "answer": "While the differential diagnosis would range from annular lichen planus(unlikely,no itching) to lyme erythema migrans(does not persist for this long), and vasculitis(leaves behind pigmentation), it would be prudent to get a biopsy for more clarity on the condition.Regards.",
