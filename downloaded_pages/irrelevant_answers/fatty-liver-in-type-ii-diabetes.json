            "answer": "I don't know about fatty liver; perhaps someone else will respond and/or you can talk with her doctor about this. However post prandial blood sugars of 214 is way too high. Complications begin to form with numbers consistently over 140. She needs to lower her blood sugars with a combination of carb reduction, exercise, weight loss if needed, and oral meds if prescribed by her doctor.",

            "answer": "Fatty liver can be attributed to hepatitis, obesity, and/or high lipid panels [cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL]. Hep A & B has a vaccine. Hep C is blood born passed from one being to another. On rare occasions it is passed by human body fluids. A simple blood test will determine if your mother test positive for the gene [was exposed but the body's immune system got rid of it] or positive for the virus's. I wouldn't think of cirrhosis until she has been tested. A liver biopsy, a Dopler Ultra-Sound scan, or a Contrasted CT Scan will determine the health state of the liver and whether any/no scarring [cirrhosis] is taking place.Losing weight weight not only helps lower blood glucose levels, but also helps to reduce fatty liver syndrome. High triglycerides points to fat cells being stored in the liver which in turn equals a fatty liver.\u00a0\u00a0Along these lines lowering her cholesterol panel [triglycerides & LDL] & sustaining from alcohol, if any, helps a lot.",

            "answer": "I don't know te connections of diabetes and fatty liver so excuse me.\u00a0\u00a0But I will say that I have known two people with fatty liver.\u00a0\u00a0One was slightly over weight and drank a few beers each evening.\u00a0\u00a0He was told me stop drinking and lose some weight.\u00a0\u00a0He stopped drinking but did not lose weight and it went away.\u00a0\u00a0I know another young man that was drinking hard liquor almost every day but was skinny.\u00a0\u00a0He was told he had to stop drinking or it would turn into cirrhosis.\u00a0\u00a0It did turn into cirrhosis and he was hospitalized.\u00a0\u00a0He is now a non drinker and no more liver problems at all.I just thought I would mention that because with fatty liver she does not need to drink at all if she even does and cirrhosis is the next step.\u00a0\u00a0We know from experience.Please have her take care of herself.\u00a0\u00a0I hope I have not scared anyone but this needs to be taken seriously.",
