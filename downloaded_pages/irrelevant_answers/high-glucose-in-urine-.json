            "answer": "Hi,One thing to consider for elevated glucose levels in the urine is diabetes mellitus.Do you have a strong personal or family history of diabetes?I suggest that you have blood tests done to determine fasting blood sugar levels. An oral glucose tolerance test may also help establish if one is prediabetic .At this point, I do not\u00a0\u00a0want you to worry. As other causes such as stress ,exercises and a recent meal intake may cause increase levels of glucose in the urine. This may be true in isolated cases.An initial work up may be necessary just to check blood glucose levels. Your BUN and Creatinine levels may also be checked to get a baseline evaluation of renal function.",
