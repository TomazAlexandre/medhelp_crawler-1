            "answer": "What are you taking metformin for? Do you have diabetes? Do you have PCOS? Is the doctor would said to stop taking it the same one who prescribed it?I did a little research and metformin is Pregnancy Category B. It is generally considered safe for pregnant women.http://diabetes.emedtv.com/metformin/metformin-and-pregnancy.htmlThe article linked above states that metofrmin is generally continued throughout the pregnancy if you are taking it for PCOS.If you are taking it for diabetes control, you should continue taking it until the doctor that is treating your diabetes says to stop taking it.I would not stop taking it without a good reason to do so.",
