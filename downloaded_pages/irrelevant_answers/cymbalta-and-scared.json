            "answer": "Namaste,Cymbalta is an antidepressant in a group of drugs called selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs). Cymbalta works by restoring the balance of certain natural substances in the brain (serotonin and norepinephrine), which helps to improve certain mood problems.Cymbalta is used to treat major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. It is also used to treat pain caused by nerve damage in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy).Cymbalta may also be used for other purposes not listed.Although there are side effects with all medications it depends on the individual as to whether or not he/she may suffer any or many.The doctor would not have prescribed the medication for you, if he/she didn't think that it was appropriate in your particular situation.If you want to learn more about the possible side effects of Cymbalta you can go to:http://www.drugs.com/cymbalta.htmlor google cymbalta and you'll get access to a number of sites that can provide information. Beware however, of sites that may not be supervised or run by qualified professionals.Finally, don't start worrying about side effects unless they occur at which time you can discuss them with your doctor.Michael",
