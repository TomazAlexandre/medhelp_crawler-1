            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Understand your predicament. Premenopausal symptoms are caused due to hormone irregularities and hey could resemble the symptoms described by you. The dizziness could be due to inner ear problems. The other causes for your symptoms could be metabolic disorders like diabetes and hypothyroidism, which\u00a0\u00a0can be detected by a simple blood test. But there is treatment for premenopausal symptoms\u00a0\u00a0in the form of Hormone Replacement therapy (HRT). You can discuss this with your primary care physician when you happen to meet him next time.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.You can consult an ENT specialist, to rule out problems in the inner ear. Also, check to rule out postural hypotension, a condition in which the peripheral arteries dilate, leading to pooling of blood in the peripheries. This in effect causes decreased circulation of blood resulting in dizziness/lightheadedness. This is more pronounced if the person stands up from a lying down position. This is detected by recording the blood pressure recordings in the sitting, standing and lying down positions. If the variations in blood pressure recordings are more than 10 mmHg, it is diagnosed as postural hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
