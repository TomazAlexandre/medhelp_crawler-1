            "answer": "Hello,Janumet is a combination of Januvia and Metformin.Did you try a different drugstore?I also live in Philippines and hate how they sometimes run out of medicines.\u00a0\u00a0It has happened to my insulin sometimes.\u00a0\u00a0And sometimes no test strips available.Ideally you ask your Dr.Metformin alone will only partially replace the Janumet, but would be better than nothing.How is your blood sugar?\u00a0\u00a0Would also be helpful if you can reduce your carbs / sweets and rice, and increase exercise to also help with your blood sugar control.",

            "answer": "Dusty,hope you are not being as flooded where you are as we are now in Manila.Your fasting blood sugar between 7.8 and 10 (140 - 180) are way too high.\u00a0\u00a0Normal is < 5.0 (90).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You must be going much higher after eating. With such high sugars you will definitely end up with complications of diabetes in the future.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Do you know what your Hba1c is?I think you should be on insulin. The cheapest insulins are Humalin-N and Humalin-R.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can you discuss this with a dr. there to get you started on insulin?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So many people with diabetes are undertreated here in Philippines and then end up with so many (preventable) complications.Are you overweight?\u00a0\u00a0if so, losing weight may help.\u00a0\u00a0Try to walk or do some exercise after eating.Let me know.",

            "answer": "hi there Super Sally thanks for advice, besides being a diabetic i am a PWD so walking is out as much as i would love to walk again, yes i am overweight due from not able to walk no more, but i have always been a big man even when i walked previously, i tried insulin injections when i lived in china but the bruising on my stomach in the end hurt too much to inject the insulin so i went onto tablets for last 2 to 3 years i am not too keen on injections again,, where i live here in Philippines is isolated and the only reasonable hospital is a ferry ride then 6 hours b y car to a hospital in CDO. when i lived in china i was told by another expat living there a long time diabetic that it is ok for blood sugar levels to be between 5 and 10 but i find that if my sugar levels go below 6 then i get all shakes and if it does go higher than 12 i go blurry eyed. i had a friend in china another expat that had a daily blood sugar wreading of 17 i think that would be extreamly high",
