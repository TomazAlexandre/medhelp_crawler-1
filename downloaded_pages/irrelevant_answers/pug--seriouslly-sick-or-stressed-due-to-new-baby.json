            "answer": "Please take your pug to the Veterinarian ASAP!\u00a0\u00a0I believe that her problem is coincidental to having the baby.\u00a0\u00a0If your pet is not spayed she may have pyometra, which is a severe uterine infection and when untreated could be fatal.\u00a0\u00a0However, from her myriad symptoms she could have diabetes, a severe urinary tract infection, kidney disease, a foreign body in her digestive system, Lyme or other tick disease, or other infectious disease, and more.\u00a0\u00a0Blood work, palpation and X-Rays will probably be necessary.Don't mess around on this!Thanks!",

            "answer": "You are very right.We took her to the vet yesterday and her white blood cell count was 22050 and today she had ultrasound that confirmed that she has pyometra!The vet said we are very lucky that we noticed her symptoms early since her cervix wasnt open.\u00a0\u00a0They are giving her something to open her cervix and antibiotics and most likely she will have operation early next week.THANKS!!!!",

    "question": "My 5 year old pug started acting strange about a week ago - we have 3 week old baby and we thought that she was maybe depressed or stressed due to the new baby....but then other symptoms like drinking a lot of water and shaking started and we are now worried.\u00a0\u00a0Her symtpoms:- She drinks a lot of water - much more than before.- She threw up once after eating and since then she wont eat any dog food or treats (she will eat people food, if we would give it to her).\u00a0\u00a0 This is always a sign that something is wrong since she loves to eat and get treats!- The same day that she threw up, she also limped around as if she had hurt one of her front paws.- She shakes as if she is freezing sometimes and the hair on her back stands up.- Sometimes she pants as if she is hot, although we are inside - she didnt do this before.- She doesnt want to play with her toys or balls anymore.I have read that drinking a lot of water can be sign of liver or hormonal issues...",
