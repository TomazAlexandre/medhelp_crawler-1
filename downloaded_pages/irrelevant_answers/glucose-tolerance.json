            "answer": "Hello!\u00a0\u00a0I failed the one hour by 5 points (my OB's cut off is 134, and I tested at 139).\u00a0\u00a0Then, I passed the three hour.\u00a0\u00a0I was totally anxious about the test, because I was afraid of getting too nauseous and of failing, of course.\u00a0\u00a0But, truthfully, it's not too terrible.\u00a0\u00a0The stuff does not taste good, but it's not horrible.\u00a0\u00a0I had the cola flavored drink (it's like a full small bottle), but some have orange flavored to choose from, also.\u00a0\u00a0Then, they take your blood before the drink and then every hour after that for three hours.\u00a0\u00a0You have to fast, but I could fast after midnight (they say give 8 hours of fasting), and I never eat after midnight anyway (if you start at 8am, then you should be ok).\u00a0\u00a0I did eat less carbs the few days before, as they say it may help.\u00a0\u00a0But, if you have GD, then you have it, and eating fewer carbs will do nothing.\u00a0\u00a0So, my efforts were futile on the carbs, but I passed.\u00a0\u00a0I did get lightheaded after the first hour, because the drink brought on a lot of baby kicking, and I was hungry!\u00a0\u00a0But, you are allowed to take sips of water, which really helped me.\u00a0\u00a0I brought work to do, so it helped to pass the time.\u00a0\u00a0Bring stuff to do, or you'll go crazy thinking about the test and how you feel.\u00a0\u00a0Also, bring food, so once you're done, you can eat right away.\u00a0\u00a0I got the sweats and shaky afterward, because I waited way too long to eat substantially after the test.\u00a0\u00a0I just had a granola bar with me, then I went home and played with the dogs before eating.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!!!",

            "answer": "I really feel for all who have to take that test. My OB didn't want to put me through that and with the higher risk that I will develop gestational diabetes because I have to take and increase steroids throughout my pregnancy I just got a glucometer and have to check it before every time I eat. Yes, maybe sounds like a pain, but atleast I don't have to drink that nasty stuff. But prayers to you all who have to go through that. Good luck. Hope your test comes out perfect.",

    "question": "hi everyone. i had my 1 hr glucose test yesterday, and i failed. i need to go saturday for the 3 hr test. (i'm very annoyed). anyways, i was wondering if anyone has failed the one hour but passed the 3 hour. also, i'm concerned about the 3 hr- the stuff i drank for the one hour made me nauseaus and jittery, and they said i have to drink much more for the 3 hr. i'm worried that i'll feel like **** having to drink all that after fasting. not to mention that i start at 8 am, so i won't be able to eat until 11 am! i'd appreciate hearing any of your experiences. thanks.",
