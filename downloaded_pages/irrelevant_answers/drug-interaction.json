            "answer": "There is no meaningful difference between the EF of 21 and 25% both numbers represent a severe impairment of the heart's pumping ability. It could just be that your diabetes is getting worse. Carvedilol should be taken with caution in diabetics because it can mask the symptoms of a low blood sugar, not a concern for you since you are not on diabetes medications that could lower your sugar in the first place.",

Could my diabetes effect my EF rating?\u00a0\u00a0I could walk 4 miles a day before I got on carevdilol. Now I can hardly make it around the block. My doctor told me that it is his expeirence that a patient will git feel worse before he gits better.",

            "answer": "Uncontrolled diabetes can affect the heart after several years, but this is not the case with you. It is not affecting your EF. The carvedilol could be making you feel worse; this is usually, but not always a temporary condition. Alternatively, your underlying cardiomyopathy may be getting worse.",

            "answer": "A cold would not lower your EF. All three tests are slightly different and can produce different EFs. However, the correct interpretation of the three tests is that your EF is low; 21, 25, and 28% are all in the same ballpark and are really the same number. I think your doctors have you on good doses of good medicines. I do not think that the medicines are causing your heart any problems, but in fact are probably keeping it from deteriorating further. Again, i do not believe your medicines are causing diabetes. Lisinopril is actually a good medicine for diabetics.",

    "question": "Hi.In May of 1999 I was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy with a EF rating of 25% by catherization.\u00a0\u00a0In Dec of 1999, by echocardiogram my EF rating was 21%. Would it be fair to assume that although the EF ratings are different that my condition has not worsened since these are different tests?I am also a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I have controlled my sugar with a diet for about a year and six months.\u00a0\u00a0Now after starting Carvedilol for my heart I have noticed that my sugar increasingly higher.\u00a0\u00a0Could there be a conection between the two?\u00a0\u00a0I have read that precaution should be taken with people with diabetes.Is it possible that the combination of any medication listed below is causing interaction?Cavedilol 12.5 mg twice a day, Spironalactone 25mg per day, Amlodipine Besylate 5mg per day, Lisinopril 40 mg per day, one baby aspirin, Furosemide 4 mg per day, Cigoxin .25mg per day.Could a ajustment be made to help my problem of both Cadiomyopathy and Diabetes.",
