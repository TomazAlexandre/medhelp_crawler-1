            "answer": "Hello dear and welcome to the medhelp forum. I can understand how distressing your situation would be. Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy can result from damaged peripheral nerves. There are certain known chemotherapy drugs and anti cancer drugs which can cause these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0The effects may be pronounced if you have co existing diabetes, malnutrition, consume alcohol or had previous chemotherapy. You need to protect your hands, use gloves when doing chores, be vigilant of cuts, abrasions or burns, and apply lotions. Your chemotherapy may need to be interrupted or dose adjusted accordingly, vitamin B complex supplements etc. consult your oncologist and if needed a neurologist who may help you with antidepressants or ant seizure medications if pain develops. You may need guided physical therapy. Wishing you all the best.",
