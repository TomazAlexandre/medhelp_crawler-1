            "answer": "The downside of regular exercise is that injuries do happen. It's pretty much inevitable unless you are always doing a very low-intensity form of exercise like walking, and even then stuff like minor sprains and strains can occur. Have you tried NSAIDs for this (OTC Advil, Motrin, Aleve, Naprosyn)?You need to cut out the exercise while you have pain. If NSAIDs don't work to alleviate the pain, you should probably see a doc about it. At the very least, they can give you something a little stronger, like Celebrex.\u00a0\u00a0Are you having neuro symptoms (tingling, numbness, radiation down the leg) or does it feel musculoskeletal in origin?\u00a0\u00a0Neuro stuff could indicate it's emanating from the back, which is a different situation.My general rule about injury recovery is to avoid working out as much as possible for about two weeks AFTER THE PAIN HAS DISAPPEARED. You want to keep any residuals of the injury from recurring. Exercising through pain isn't going to get you anywhere in terms of furthering your fitness or your recovery, so you need to stop working out until the pain has subsided.I've always found the NSAIDs to work great. (My preference is for Aleve, but the others work the same.)\u00a0\u00a0My doc told me the standard dosages of the OTC NSAIDs can be increased depending on the severity of the pain/injury. You can start with the dose as prescribed on the package for a few days, and if it is still painful, try adding one extra tablet to each dose you take and see if that works. NSAIDs can cause stomach problems so keep that in mind as well.",

    "question": "Its been a year since I have joined Curves and started jogging/walking 3 to 4 miles about 4 times a week. Of course I do remember the soreness in the begining but naturally the exercise became much easier as my body got used to it and I hardly felt any sort of pains after jogging, but close to a month ago I woke up and felt as if I had strained my left leg. I did not think anything of it but the feeling has not gone away. I also tried stretching more before exercise. Should I be worried. I feel like I cant get the same workout as before even while walking.",
