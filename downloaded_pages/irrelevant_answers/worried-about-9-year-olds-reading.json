            "answer": "Hi Maggie,As you know, we're not physicians here.While results vary, here are some rules of thumb for normal BG values --Fasting - less than 1002 hrs after eating -- less than 140Random -- less than 126Lots of things can cause a temporary, non-diabetic spike in blood sugar readings, including non-clean hands with yummy, sticky sweet stuff on 'em.Watch for other classic signs of diabetes, unexplained weight loss, insatiable thirst or hunger, frequent urination, yeast infections, lethargy. etc.\u00a0\u00a0It's great you will share your observations & data collection with the girl's MD.*You* seem to be doing terrifically well controlling your gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0That's fabulous! and you're creating a great environment for your baby to develop in :-))",

            "answer": "Hello Maggi and thank you for visiting MedHelp.\u00a0\u00a0While we are not doctors around here, most of us have plenty of experience with diabetes and related topics.\u00a0\u00a0From what you have told us, your daughter has only had one high reading.\u00a0\u00a0There are many things that could make this happen.\u00a0\u00a0The most common would be not cleaning the area you tested on first.\u00a0\u00a0I have heard of random spikes in blood sugar as well, but 248 seems pretty high.\u00a0\u00a0If I were you I would do just what you are doing.\u00a0\u00a0Log everything and then go from there.It is great that you are concerned about your daughter, but I wouldn't jump the gun just yet. Keep an eye on her and her blood sugars, then make an apointment with her doctor if you see anything else out of the ordinary.\u00a0\u00a0However, if she starts vomiting please get her to the ER.Please let us know how things go.",

    "question": "HI,I am wondering if I can get some input from all of you.\u00a0\u00a0I have been using a glucometer to keep track of my glucose while I am pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0My 9 year asked if I could test her yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0I did and it was 248.\u00a0\u00a0This was about 1 hour after eating a bowl of froot loops.\u00a0\u00a0So I told her not to eat for another hour-200.\u00a0\u00a0At 4 hours after eating, 98.\u00a0\u00a0And about 2 hours after eating dinner and drinking sweetened iced tea, 148.\u00a0\u00a0This numbers concern me, but then, I think maybe she is just eating too much sugar!\u00a0\u00a0I am a nurse but this is not my area of knowledge.\u00a0\u00a0I will probably test her fasting and keep a diary, but I hate to call the doctor too early and jump the gun here.\u00a0\u00a0I read on the internet on other sites that even after eating a meal sugars should stay under 140 in a healthy person?\u00a0\u00a0My sugars have been great, my highest reading was 145 so far after eating pancakes and maple syrup for breakfast.thanks, I appreciate that this forum is here and I will direct any patients I come across needing more information!Maggi",
