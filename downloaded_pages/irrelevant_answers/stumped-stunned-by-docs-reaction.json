            "answer": "Probably worth getting a second opinion.With the throat symptoms, acid reflux (even w/o symptoms of heartburn) is more likely cause than thyroid enlargement.\u00a0\u00a0And - \"enlargement\" on ultrasound may be a technical measurement difference and not a true enlargement.Try to see an endocrinologist who does ultrasound in the office -- that way you will get most of your answers the first visit.",

            "answer": "I feel your pain I choke on my food all the time and and water and anything I swallow just gets hung up- my voice changes- the whole downplaying of how you feel because of your thyroid- and I know it isn't reflux did that each time I was pregnant and you would know that feeling! due to many doctors attitudes that it's no big deal *****. I will tell you right now I have Celiac disease, Arthritis, Gout and Sclerosing mesenteritis- I am on no medication because I wont take antidepressants and doctors cannot stand when you take the time to help yourself if you dont just do what they say they want nothing to do with you- hence years of suffering- all because they get paid no matter what. They diagnose and treat you they get paid, they diagnose and dont treat you they get paid, they dont diagnose you and dont treat you with the appropriate medication and guess what they still get paid! Alot of money too. I know what profession I should've gotten into! They take the oath but do they live by it hell no. If by some miracle you manage to get some help for that made up problem in your head not your thyroid please let me know as I would be interested in finding a doctor who gives a hoot. Meanwhile I will continue my search.",

    "question": "My endo has taken a wait and see approach.\u00a0\u00a0At most recent appointment I learned that he did not order thyroid testing, but lots of Diabetic work up which was normal.\u00a0\u00a0I have no history of Diabetes in family but there are thyroid issues.\u00a0\u00a0I explained that symptoms are more problematic esp the choking feeling in my throat.\u00a0\u00a0I can live with the dry skin, joint pain up and down fatigue levels, etc but not if I can't breathe.\u00a0\u00a0I've had several choking episodes eating and now with even drinking water. Gastroeterologist did a scope and found nothing to cause this and suggested thyroid involvement.\u00a0\u00a0Based on that he decided to do ultra sound of thyroid and lo and behold it has 'grown' since my last appt 3 mo ago.\u00a0\u00a0He says it's large but there is nothing to be done but watch it and wait for it 'to die and atrophy'.\u00a0\u00a0there are nodules but he thinks they are stable.\u00a0\u00a0Can this be correct that I just need to wait for the gland to die?\u00a0\u00a0What about thyroid production?\u00a0\u00a0Don't I need that?\u00a0\u00a0He doesn't want to see me for 4 months and gave me a lab slip for again, diabetic testing, and T4 and TSH only.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was too stunned to say much.\u00a0\u00a0I'd appreciate your input, I've learned a lot reading the questions and answers.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
