            "answer": "Inaccurate measurements on one ultrasound or the other, that's the most likely reason.There just isn't enough info here to really say.\u00a0\u00a0Did the ultrasound show any signs of any other problems?Do you have gestational diabetes?The range of weights you've given is not specific enough.\u00a0\u00a0For example, if the baby weighed 4 pounds at 30 weeks and 6 pounds at 33 weeks, that's not too far out of the norm for a weight GAIN (though still a very big baby, certainly).\u00a0\u00a0But if the baby weighed 3 pounds at 30 weeks, and 7 pounds at 33 weeks...something really isn't right about that.What does your doctor say?",

            "answer": "well they are supposed to gain about a half pound per weeks so at 30 weeks the baby was 4 lbs then it was supposed to gain 1.5 lbs so that makes 5.5 lbs which is close to your 6 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0It is very possible that this is normal.\u00a0\u00a0Being off by 1 lb can make a huge difference in what you may think is normal or what is not normal.",
