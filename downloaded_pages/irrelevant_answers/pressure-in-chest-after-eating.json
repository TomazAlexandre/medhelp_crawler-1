            "answer": "any other health problems? diabetes?sounds like GERD. you don't necessarily have to have acid coming up into your mouth for this. you should see your dr for this.since it's been going on for a year, and happens frequently, it needs to be worked up. they may treat you empirically with meds and see if you improve, may do a 24h pH monitoring test, or may do an endoscopy (which is the most invasive but best test, and will allow for not only direct visualization of the upper GI system- for changes due to more acid/reflux, but also for biopsy if needed). depends on your clinic and how they handle this.",

LOLThe good news is, they can check with a simple ultrasound and the surgery is an outpatient lyproscopic surgery.\u00a0\u00a0The bad news is, your eating pattern will need to change... everything digests differently after its removed.Good luck and keep us posted.",
