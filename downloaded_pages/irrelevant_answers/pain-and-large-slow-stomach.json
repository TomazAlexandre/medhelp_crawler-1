            "answer": "Hello - thanks for asking your question.Gall bladder and pancreatic diseases are possibilities.\u00a0\u00a0These can be evaluated with an ultrasound and CT scan respectively.Other considerations would be dyspepsia (either an ulcer or gastritis) - this can be evaluated by a repeat endoscopy.\u00a0\u00a0Splenic disease is less likely, but still possible.\u00a0\u00a0A CT scan would further evaluate this.Nausea and abdominal pain are characteristic of delayed gastric emptying (i.e. the large-slow stomach).\u00a0\u00a0Typically, this is diagnosed in conjunction with diabetes or other neurological disorders.\u00a0\u00a0You can obtain a gastric emptying scan to evaluate for this.If every test described above is negative, then musculoskeletal or rheumatological causes may be considered.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to consider further evaluation by a rheumatologist.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

            "answer": "gallbladder is a possibility. People with gallstones also are at risk for pancreatitis: it's easy to check those things out. Hernias of the abdominal wall are usually in the midline and fairly easy to diagnose as a lump, sometimes an intermittant one. There's not much a spleen would do to cause intermittant symptoms for 10 years.",
