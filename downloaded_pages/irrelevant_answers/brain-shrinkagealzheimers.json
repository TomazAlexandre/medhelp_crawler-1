            "answer": "You should try to get second or third opinions with neurologists till you get an explanation that makes sense.My mother had some of the things you said you experienced. She was young too. She has had quite a few\u00a0\u00a0TIA's.(so they say) we have noticed a few\u00a0\u00a0in the past few years.\u00a0\u00a0Prior she just had alot of UTI's and would get dingy and wind up in the hospital. They would just tell us sometimes people who are hospitalized get this sort of dementia when they wind up hospitalized.Later a Medicare MD told us she had Vascular Dementia and out of all the MDs this was the one diagnosis that made the most sense.If you have Blood pressure issues and high cholesterol, or diabetes these things could affect you I suppose. They did with my Mom.Even messed up or lacking female hormones can mess with you.All of us get forgetful but yours sounds much more than forgetful.I would not rest till someone could figure out why you have atrophy in your brain and what you can do. Maybe Aricept is something that would be helpful for you.I wish you luck.",

    "question": "I have had memory loss over the past 2 years, I'm a 47 yr. old female.\u00a0\u00a0There are things I don't remember in the recent past and no matter how hard I try the memory doesn't come back. I have always been excellent in math, most of the time knowing an answer in my head so fast it surprised even me. Lately I can't even do simple math in my head and alot of times not on paper. I have called a family member by a different name the whole day but the next day I wouldn't even remember doing it.\u00a0\u00a0I had a CT Scan of my brain and it showed brain shrinkage. The DR. told me about it but said don't worry I'm not saying you will get Alzheimer's.\u00a0\u00a0My question is, does anyone know about Brain shrinkage and is it a symptom of the disease?",
