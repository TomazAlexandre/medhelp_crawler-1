            "answer": "Hi and welcome to the forum.Considering that you have a number of conditions that can cause the pain that you describe, I think you need to look further there before getting worried. How is your thyroid level now? And especially, what are you doing about this as well as the B12 level? Are you getting treatment for the fibro?
