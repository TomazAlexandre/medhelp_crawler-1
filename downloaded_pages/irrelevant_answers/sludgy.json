            "answer": "Despite your GB working well, for some sludge can cause problems such as contributing to common bile duct spasms and bouts of pancreatitis - wonder if that's where yours came from????Some docs work with patients to try to dissolve the sludge - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. It can take some time, however, when it does work.Depending on what your doc knows about your condition, he/she may recommend that the GB be removed. If you do elect to do the surgery, please ask your surgeon to make sure to sweep the common bile duct before closing you up. Some of that sludge can escape during surgery at times and it can cause a major problem with irritation and spasms of the duct. You want to avoid that at all costs.",
