Well, for two\u00a0\u00a0months I've had a low grade fever I can not get rid of. My doctor gave me an antibiotic an it went away for a month. A few weeks later it came back and the doctor has me going to an infectious disease doctor. My blood work came back with the white blood cells slightly elevated, obgyn tests were fine, urine test came back fine an so did my chest exray.
