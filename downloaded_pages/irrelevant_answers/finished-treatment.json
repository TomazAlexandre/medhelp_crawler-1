            "answer": "Hi Sue\u2014If you completed your treatment with undetectable virus, and can keep it that way for six months without medication, then it will not come back (barring reinfection from another source). This is termed \u2018SVR\u2019 (Sustained Viral Response), and is considered very durable.Your doctor should have scheduled another viral test for you at six months post treatment; if he hasn\u2019t, be sure to call the office and speak with them about this.Genotype 3 patients will statistically achieve SVR around 70% of the time; these are relatively good odds compared to other genotypes.Best of luck with your upcoming tests\u2014Bill",

            "answer": "I was geno 3. Bloodwork was back to normal and felt great one month post-tx. This seems fairly typical, some take longer. Developed other health problems one year post-tx, but don't know if tx-related or just things that would have happened anyway or would have been worse without tx (insomnia, hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol). Never hurts to keep an eye on all that stuff, even if your healthy.Good luck.",
