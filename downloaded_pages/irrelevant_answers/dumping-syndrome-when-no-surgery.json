    "question": "I am a 25 year old female who has been experiencing symptoms identical to those found in dumping syndrome (nausea, cramping, weakness, warmth, diarrhea--especially after eating or drinking sweets) since I was about 13.\u00a0\u00a0All doctors I have talked to are stumped.\u00a0\u00a0I have never had any type of surgery, nor have I had ulcers or any other stomach problem.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering if I am the only person who experiences this dumping syndrome without having undergone a serious stomach alteration.\u00a0\u00a0I have altered my diet to prevent these episodes, but I occassionally still experience these painful episodes.Please, any help would be appreciated.",
