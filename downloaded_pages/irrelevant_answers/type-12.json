            "answer": "All sorts of exercise are beneficial.Weight training builds muscle mass, muscle uses sugar when it is active.Low to moderate intensity aerobic activity will have immediate impact on blood sugar (jogging, swimming, biking etc) and will help reduce it, and the impact can last for 24 hours or more after the exercise.Very intense physical activity may first raise blood sugar, followed by a drop later.if you are on insulin or sulfonurea drugs, you need to monitor your blood sugar before, during and after exercise until you know how you typically respond (then you can still monitor, but maybe less frequently).",
