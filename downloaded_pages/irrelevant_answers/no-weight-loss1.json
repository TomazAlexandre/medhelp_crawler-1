            "answer": "i've had the same question since i was diagnosed 3 years ago. i weigh 195 & only lost 15 pounds before i got diagnosed, then put it back on & stayed the same. i once read that the weight loss is caused by not eating due to pain. that would explain it for me cause i always eat. could also be because i never had actual diarrhea. there was also another person who wrote a comment about gaining weight. so i think that yes, it's normal. will we ever lose weight? i don't know. hope this helps, take care",

            "answer": "I'm one of those people that lived with Crohn's but am obese.\u00a0\u00a0Nobody thought I had crohn's because of my weight.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter also has it and would lose weight really fast when she flared.\u00a0\u00a0I had \"d\" for 30 years but always chalked it up to IBS and not Crohn's.\u00a0\u00a0About 8 years ago it got much worse but still thought it was normal IBS.\u00a0\u00a0Ended up in the hospital last year because of a fistula to my bladder that had to be fixed.\u00a0\u00a0When the surgeon went in he found that I had crohns.From what I understand it depends on where your disease activity is.\u00a0\u00a0If it is in the TI area you are more likely to lose weight not only because of pain but because you don't absorb nutrients.\u00a0\u00a0That is why children who have CD can have growth failure.\u00a0\u00a0All my disease activity was in my lower colon where moisture is absorbed.\u00a0\u00a0That's why I had bad \"d\".",

            "answer": "I never lost weight either. I was just diagnosed with Crohns in August and my surgeon was sure I didn't have it because I didn't have the normal symptoms of weight loss, blood in stool, vomiting, etc. I'm also not super skinny. In fact I could stand to lose some weight although I'm not obese.\u00a0\u00a0I think I must have a mild case of Crohns. I did have some inflamation and ulcers and mild gastritis. I think they still don't know enough about Crohns and what really causes it, etc.As to the poster who asked about other things to try than medication. I went to my local health food store and asked all kinds of questions and picked up a book called \"The Gut Solution\" which is really good. It gives natural remedies and foods to try and what to avoid. They recommend probiotics, flax and/or fish oil, a good multi-vitamin, and folic acid. We have to watch that we're getting enough B12 too since the only place in the body that produces B12 is in the terminal ileum (the small intestine near where it hooks up to the large intestine). I've also heard that food allergies can play a role with Crohns so I'm going to get tested. I do know that certain foods don't seem to agree with me. I really think our diet and life style plays a big role in our health. I'm trying to learn more and get more healthy. I wasn't always so kind to my body. I ate a lot of junk and didn't exercise. I also used to smoke but quite many years ago. They do say more smokers seem to have Crohns for some reason. Interestingly enough there seems to be a link with diabetes too. I guess because they're both auto immune diseases. I have a lot of diabetes in my family but I didn't get it. I'm really not sure why or how I got it. I may never know. I'm just trying to take the best care of myself as I can right now. I wish you all the best.",
