            "answer": "I just joined this group here a day ago, and already found lots and lots of good advice from people reaching out, and also reading the posts regarding my concerns.All I can say to you is to be very careful if you get to considering suboxone, which is describe in many circles as the \"miracle\" cure for opiate withdrawals.It is a cure, but it has a price to pay.What I know now is that I would look for another option, like \"Thomas' recipe\" or something that may be suggested here from others who know, depending on the severity of your withdrawals.One idea keeps coming out of what I read of others experiences; the more you have taken, the more you pay the cost. That said, there are optimal ways to pay that will be worth your learning to save you from getting in deeper than you need.6 months in so far, as you say you have been taking, is relatively shorter than many have, so indeed you can be happy about that.",

This is day two of my trying to do this cold turkey and I feel like hell but Im more worried about how to make this forever. Being sober seems so boring. I can relax better, interact w/ people and work better with the pills. I know this rationalization is crazy but how do you get past it and live a 'normal' life.",

            "answer": "Hey Thanks for all the responses everyone. I looked into suboxone and it seems like trading one addiction for another. I spoke with my doctor after going through a day or so of decent withdrawals, and they prescribed me Thorazine. It doesnt do a whole lot, but it makes it a little less uncomfortable I guess... I decided to look at it as if Ive gotten the Flu and knowing that it will get better, just like a flu would seems to help. I realized a lot of this is mental, but ya the physical symptoms suck hard.Good luck to everyone else, and thanks again!",

My plan is to start picking up more hobbies, surfing, camping trips with family/ friends, etc... Life can and will be great without these little pills. Maybe some meetings or counseling will help. I know a number of people who swear by NA or even AA, and often times refer to them as their second family. Best of Luck!",

    "question": "Hey There.So Ive been taking vicodin, norco, and percoset all doctor prescribed, and dosing as the doctor ordered. I was taking 8 vicodin 5/500 a day for a couple few months, then moved to 8 - 10 norco a day 7.5/325 for couple weeks, then moved to 6 - 8 percocet, 7.5/325 a day for a couple weeks. After my surgery to fix the pain, I was sooo happy to find that it did in fact nearly eliminate the pain. I have diabetes so the surgery time kept being postponed, explaining the length of pain med use.\u00a0\u00a0Finally Im not in much pain but Im all out of pills, and Im starting to withdrawal so far its just sweats, chills, random goosebumps, nausea, irritable, restlessness, etc.. Im curious as to how long you think this should last? Is it best to tough it out cold turkey, or wean off them? I have diabetes so the withdrawal symptoms raise my blood sugar just adding to the whole mess. Any suggestions?Also, this is day one of withdrawal symptoms, if that makes a difference.A quick response would be much appreciated!Thanks so much.",
