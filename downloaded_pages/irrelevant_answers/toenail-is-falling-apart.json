            "answer": "\"A few months ago it started getting thicker and the top layer just came off, now it just looks weird and seems to be growing up instead of out.\"There are a few things it could be. Unfortunately I'm dealing with the same thing so Ill share what I have learned. It could be:1) toenail fungus2) hyperkeratinization (callusing of the nail bed)3) Diabetes4) bacterial infection5) Nail polishHere's some info I clipped for you:What Causes a Toenail to Fall Off?As previously noted, there are two primary reasons for toenail loss: infection and injury. The most common cause of toenail loss is a contagious fungal infection cause by various types of dermatophytes, which are fungi that feed upon the keratin found in the skin and nails. Dermatophytes can also affect the skin, resulting in athlete\u2019s foot, or tinea pedis. The problem with this is that in a warm, moist environment\u2014i.e., the environment found in shoes and socks\u2014the infection can spread rapidly and transfer to the toenails, resulting in onychomycosis. Infection is often seen in successive generations of families, likely due to sharing of hygenic products and showers.In the case of injury, we see the loss of toenails most frequently in sports such as running, soccer, skating, and skiing. Pressure on the nail from shoe gear causes blistering of the skin under the nail and eventually separation of the nail plate. An acute separation may result in bleeding from under the nail.You can find that info here:http://www.footvitals.com/toenails/toenail-falling-off.htmlYour best bet is to make an appointment with a Podiatrist or Dermatologist so he can evaluate and diagnose you. Whatever it is, its treatable.Good Luck",
