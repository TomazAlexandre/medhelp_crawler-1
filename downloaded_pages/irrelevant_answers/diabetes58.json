            "answer": "Hi!Strange that no one got back to you before this. Me, I just have not been hereThe lab tests should have told you what type diabetic she is. A fasting (no food or drink(water ok) from midnight the previous night) blood test done twice on two different days would tell you if she is a t-1 or t-12. Also having an A1C test to see what he rsugar levels have been running for the past 3 months.Didn't you talk to the doctor? If not, I would certainly get those tests done that I mentioned. They will tell the doctor if she is a diabetic.As far as the cyst, I had one and it's not necessarily caused by diabetes. A cyst is usually from an ingrown hair folicle. Mine had to be lanced.A t-1 & t-2 symptoms are very similar; loss of weight, thirsty constantly, urininating constantly, blurred vision, irritable, no appetite like I had, being tired, weak, cuts or sores that do not heal quickly. We both can and do suffer leg pain which can be PAD, periphial arerty disease.\u00a0\u00a0Type 2 can go undiagnosed for years and a lot of people put on weight.I hope this helps.",

            "answer": "In order to differentiate Type 1 from Type 2 you will need a c-peptide test which tells you how much insulin yuor daughter is actually producing and several antibody tests. Type 1's have very little insulin or none, while Type 2's have normal or high c-peptide levels. But the antibody tests are definitive as Type 1's (and 1.5's ) produce antibodies as it is an autoimmune disorder and Type 2's do not. Symptoms can be similar, treatment is not.",
