            "answer": "Hi I have diabetes insipidus too. Mine is partial so it ebbs and flows a bit and I do have to adjust my DDAVP dose sometimes. Without DDAVP my fluid consumption is 4 or more gallons a day. At first, I kept a fluid intake and output diary. Also I weighed myself every morning to see if I was taking to much medication and/or not consuming the right amount of fluids.And yes, for me the best approach has ended up to take DDAVP just at night so that I can sleep without having to get up every 1/2 hour to drink and pee. Then by day I drink and pee as much as i need to. If I will be in a situation where bathrooms or fluid intake is a prob then i take a small dose in the day as well.It is truly a bizarre condition! At first I think that many people tend to overdo it on the DDAVP and get themselves overhydrated, which can be dangerous. But then not taking in enough fluids is not good either.So how about you? What form of DDAVP are you on? What is your average intake/output without meds? Any specific questions?Horselip",

            "answer": "Hi, thank you for getting back to me.\u00a0\u00a0I stopped taking the DDAVP about 10 months ago, because I felt that if I didn't I was going to end up with a heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0For the past four years I kept telling the endo that I was having times of rapid heart beats, and that I could hear my heart pumping in my head, and that I immediately blew up, and wasn't able to get the water out.\u00a0\u00a0Then last January I knew I had to get off of it because the blood pressure went up 185/120 and I felt horrible.\u00a0\u00a0Its been a bit hard especially when I am under emotional stress, fighting an illness, over tired or apprenhensive.\u00a0\u00a0Then its like a demon is inside and I drink and drink.\u00a0\u00a0I also have to drink really cold water or ice tea.\u00a0\u00a0Room temperature does nothing to quiet the thirst.\u00a0\u00a0So in January my MD put me on a water pill and that helped a little, the cardologist said I needed BP meds, and so for six months I was put on one and then another with all kinds of varying effects.\u00a0\u00a0Finally a month ago I took myself off all and I am running between 125/70 to 135/80.\u00a0\u00a0I am afraid that I am hurting the kidneys with the water pill and I am going to try and give the body a time to adjust.\u00a0\u00a0I get worse with the bloating as the day continues. The endo finally said last week that I am the first person he has treated that has such adverse reactions.\u00a0\u00a0However, I did the research it is not that rare.\u00a0\u00a0I can drink 1 gallon to 3 gallons depending on my surroundings.\u00a0\u00a0I stopped charting, as I was charting the BP, the amount of food I was eating and symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0The endo has said for the past three years he thinks I need gastric bi pass as I am considered obese.\u00a0\u00a0I know that, I have gained 50 pounds in the past four years.\u00a0\u00a0When I stopped the DDAVP, I dropped 15 in 10 days.\u00a0\u00a0When I went on the water pill I dropped 10 in seven days.\u00a0\u00a0But that came back again when I stopped the water pill.\u00a0\u00a0It was a double edge sword, it made me feel thirsty because I was going so much.\u00a0\u00a0I can loose or gain up to 7 pounds in 24 hours and it is really hard on the self esteem button.\u00a0\u00a0How did you end up with this?\u00a0\u00a0Did you have a removal of a pituitary tumor?\u00a0\u00a0I tell you, this is a hard condition to live with every day.\u00a0\u00a0But I am now wondering if the thryoid might have something to do with my blood work numbers, and if the symptoms I have been complaining about for the past four years might be due to a malfunction from thryoid.\u00a0\u00a0I look forward to hearing bak from you, its just so wonderful to talk to people who are in the same situation.",

            "answer": "Hi again-When you have DI, it means that you don\u2019t make enough Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) also known as Vasopressin. In a healthy person this is a hormone that is made by the posterior part of the pituitary gland. Like you, I stopped making enough ADH because of pituitary surgery. Without enough ADH, you pee and pee and pee. You can\u2019t help it. If your thirst mechanism works right, you are also really thirsty in a way that only another DIer can understand. This is so that you replace what you are peeing out.And yes, if I could drink ice, I would. I also like bubbly things like sparking water. I can down a liter in one big gulp. It truly is like a demon like you say \uf04a It has nothing to do with room temperature. It is a hormone deficiency.You poor thing. It sounds to me like you never found the right dose or timing of how to take the DDAVP.\u00a0\u00a0But for sure you were holding onto too much fluids. Of course this would increase your blood pressure and cause the water weight gain. That is dangerous and could cause your electrolytes to get too low. But DDAVP is truly a miracle for those of us who have DI. Seriously I would be so sleep deprived, if I could not take it at night that I would go nuts. You might rethink this and try the DDAVP again for your own sanity. I would rec that you proceed cautiously and work closely with your doctor and try the smallest possible dose that you can, only at night to start and take it from there.What dose were you on?The smallest dose that is available are 0.1 mg tablets. I take \u00bc of one pill about an hour before I go to bed.\u00a0\u00a0My neuroendo has nicknamed me \u201csuper-splice\u201d because if this. The DDAVP lasts until about 8 am the next morning. Then the water works begin and I become the human pee machine again. For me, this is what works best. The little bit of DDAVP that I take at night is enough that I do not pee every half hour and am not thirsty through the night and I can SLEEP. But, by day I prefer to guzzle and pee. I tend to get fluid overloaded when on DDAVP during the day, as I still want to drink fluids but the DDAVP makes me stop peeing so the fluids build up. But sometimes I do have to take DDAVP in the day because I am in a situation where I cannot drink a liter and pee every 30-60 minutes.There is another hormone called aldosterone that is made by the adrenal glands. If you are low it can cause similar symptoms to DI. I wonder if your doctor has ruled this out?Horselip",

            "answer": "I got DI after pituitary surgery to remove a Rathke's Cleft cyst in January 2006. The cyst was pressing on my pituitary stalk and the surgeon had to remove some of my gland. So I no longer make any of the pituitary hormones.Good that the blood pressure is under control now. So you cannot take a nighttime dose of DDAVP?Yes, that's why I don't take DDAVP during the day as I get fluid overloaded, if I do. Sometimes I even take a night off if I feel puffy or am holding onto fluid.How long ago was your surgery? My DI is not as severe as it was a few years ago when I had to take a higher dose of DDAVP and I had to take it in the daytime too.",

If I don't take enough I feel fatigued and if I take to much my weight goes up but when the dose was decreased the bulk of the weight came off.Have you tried other medications?",

            "answer": "I wanted to let you know that there are other people with DI so we are not alone. One of the things that has helped me to cope is to find the humor in this bizarre condition! I met several other DIers, when I was first diagnosed and it was comforting to know that I was not alone. Now, I'm pretty used to it and don't really even think about it.There are situations that DIers find ourselves in esp when the DDAVP runs out. Since our consumption of fluids and need to pee is quite beyond the norm there are weird and funny things connect us.The grocery cart is often\u00a0\u00a075% fluids-I use a LOT of ice-When I go out to a restaurant I ask for a pitcher of water. Sometimes the server won't do it, but then once I've asked for the fifth of sixth refill they bring over the pitcher-I plan errands around where I can find bathrooms and know every bathroom in our little community-When I visit me parents, who live in another state, my dad always makes sure that he has cases of sparkling water for me. He sets up a cooler for me to use for when we drive around! It is very cute. Ditto with many other friends and family-So I guess that I am a spoiled and very thirsty DIerHorselip",
