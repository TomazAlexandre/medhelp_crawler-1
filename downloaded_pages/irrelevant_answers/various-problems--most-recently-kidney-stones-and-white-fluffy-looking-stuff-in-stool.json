    "question": "hi i am a Caucasian twenty year old male in normally decent health. about three years ago i was around two hundred pounds and within six months i was down to 150. the weight loss was accompanied by nausea always followed by vomiting, dizziness, weakness, and severe abdominal pain. i had an endoscopy as well as various blood tests but no result was ever found, i also had a ct scan, was tested for diabetes and thryoid conditions all was negative. for about a year and a half or so i didn't lose any more weight but since then i have only gained about 15 pounds back, i always find myself hungry and seem to be eating entirely to much at meals but cannot seem to get full. a couple of months back i begin to have abdominal pain again and woke up one morning with crippling pain in my lower back and was found to have kidney stones.a couple of days ago i found a white what appeared to be fluffy string-like material attached to my stool, i was dismissed by so many doctors previously i am afraid to go back. on a different note for about the last six months or so i have been experiencing insomnia on almost a daily basis.any ideas would be much appreciated.",
