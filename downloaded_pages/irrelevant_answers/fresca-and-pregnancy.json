            "answer": "It's so hard to determine what is safe to drink and what isn't anymore. I don't even chew gum because I know there are those fake substitutes and other things that aren't healthy for it so I don't chew gum and I don't drink anything with carbon or caffiene. It's so bothersome to have to worry about all of it.",

            "answer": "Mmmm...Peach Fresca! That is the BEST kind!I drink it quite a bit, too. I figure one can a day won't kill you or hurt the baby. I just always follow any kind of soda up with a glass (or at least a half glass) of water.If it's safe to drink the amount of caffiene from TWO cups of coffee a day, I don't think one can of soda with artificial sweetener will hurt the baby. Of course, I tried to stay away from all forms of soda during my first trimester...except Ginger Ale...since that's when the baby's organs and nervous system are FIRST developing.Just my opinion! :-)",
