            "answer": "You have to fast for 12 hour before the 3 hour test and the drink has more sugar in it. your really there for 4 to 5 hours cuz when you go in they draw your blood to make sure its good. then they give you the drink and every hour after they take another sample as long as your scores the last 2 blood samples is under 140 you wont have gestational diabetes... I had to take the one hour test at 20 weeks it came back a little high so they sent me in to take the 3 hour and I passed! Then they made me take the 3 hour test again at 28 weeks ugg! But the reason I had to take it so many times is cuz im a bigger woman im 6'0 and weigh 300 lbs so my doctor was a little concerned about it.\u00a0\u00a0But im guessing I pass my 28 weeks cuz no one has called me... yay! Usually if it comes back that you do have gestational diabetes they call back as soon as they can to get you into show you how to take your blood and check it.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!!!!!",
