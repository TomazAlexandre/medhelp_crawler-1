            "answer": "Hi...since u have hernias, I would suggest u also look into a condition called Ehlers-Danlos....and here is some info to support the vagus nerve's relationship to ur condition.The biochemist Carey Reams, PhD, said, \"Illness begins with the Vagus Nerve.\" The Hiatal Hernia Syndrome (HHS)--by pinching the Vagus Nerve--causes Vagus Nerve Imbalance (VNI). This imbalance is usually a hyperexcitability, but a decreased energy state is also possible at some point in time. In a Hiatus Hernia, or Hiatal Hernia, the upper portion of the stomach protrudes through the opening (hiatus) in the diaphragm muscle. I urge the reader to go beyond any preconceived notions that this condition only causes GERD (acid reflux) and minor discomfort.There is much more on this topic if u r interested.....from what I understand the vagus nerve can affect many other issues.U do sound like u may have autoimmune issues....as do I...Hashimoto's thyroiditis....not sure if this is what thyroid condition u have, but with the hernia it is likely.\"selma\"",
