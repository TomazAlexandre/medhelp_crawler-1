            "answer": "Hi I was here to ask a question about my lab work and noticed your question.\u00a0\u00a0From what I have been told, once you start taking you can't stop.It does appear as if your TSH is on the high side of what this lab says is normal.I had heard that the range for normal TSH numbers had been lowered. I take t3 and it really helped me quite a bit.\u00a0\u00a0Is that what Thyronorm is?\u00a0\u00a0Are you diabetic?\u00a0\u00a0I am guessing that is what the sugamet is for.\u00a0\u00a0I was on Metformin for diabetes and was able to stop taking it as I am controlling my diabetes with diet.Good luckDee",

            "answer": "Whether you can stop the thyronorm or not depends on why you have hypothyroidism to begin with.\u00a0\u00a0Some types of hypothyroidism resolve on their own and your thyroid would start working again, so you be able to stop taking the med.\u00a0\u00a0If you have an autoimmune thyroid disease called Hashimoto's, which is what most of us on the forum have, you will have to be on the med for the rest of your life.\u00a0\u00a0 Hashimoto's is progressive and continually attacks and destroys healthy thyroid tissue, until it eventually produces no hormones on its own.I think someone commented on your labs on a different thread on which you posted the same information.Dee - go ahead and post your labs, if you haven't already... we'll be happy to comment on them.",
