            "answer": "Thank you for you opinion! Well, she has not gained weight, but has grown 1/2 in 2 months. I think that she is loosing inches because her clothes too big. (The same clothes that at the begining of school were a little snug.) I too hope that the diagnosis is incorrect, but I am starting to realize that chances are that they are not.",

But if worse comes to worse and your child is diabetic it can be controlled. Your child is so blessed to have a parent like you. Please remember you are in my heart and you are not alone. I have been keeping up with your posts and pray for you daily. Good luck and God bless.",

            "answer": "I am so discouraged! I missed the phone call from the endocrinologist today, but my mom spoke to him. He told us that he was still waiting on some of the other blood tests. I was so angry because the hospital did not do the insulin levels when we did the oral glucose tolerance test. I am glad that they were able to add the test without having to restick her. Thank God.Well, thank you all for the prayers and keep us in them!",

    "question": "OK! Now I am really confused! My 5 year old, who was reciently diagnosed diabetes had initially had inconclusive blood results. (HgbA1C=5.5, C-Peptide=1.0, FBS= 96, thyroid, cholesterol, and blood count were all normal)We went to see the pediatric endocrinologist, who ordered more blood testing. The glucose tolerance test results were: fasting = 87, 30 min = 166, 60 min = 119, and 120 min = 108. We are pending results of insulin levels, and hopefully will get them back soon. We also had antibody testing done which were all negative (islet cell, GAD, and insulin). I am waiting for the doctor to call me back. I have been watching what she eats since all this started right before Christmas. Her fasting blood sugars on our glucometer have been ranging from 87 to 169, and random readings have been ranging from 76 to 266. I have been carb counting and if I keep her total daily carb intake at 150 or less, I can control the sugars to the almost normal range. She has had a couple of times when she has been under 100, and complained about not feeling well. We are not on insulin, and I am very frustrated because it looks to me as though all the testings are normal, but we are still having the symptoms: urinating often (especially at night), drinking alot, and increased eating (craving high carb foods). She is constantly starving! I am at my wits end!Could it be possible that this is not diabetes? What else could this be? Any recommendations?",
