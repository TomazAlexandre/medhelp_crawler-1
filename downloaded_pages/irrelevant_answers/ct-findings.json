            "answer": "Hello Madam,This seems like a relatively complicated case, also it seems as though your numbers are confusing, \"My bloodwork had elevated alkaline phosphatase levels 165 and my alk phos. liver was 103.\" Both of those are the same test...so it does not make sense. If you could provide some more details to your case, \"a lot of infections\" please try to elaborate so we can give you better feedback. Start with medical history (hypertension, diabetes, heart problems etc) then surgical history, allergies, current medications, how many infections you had, what kind of treatments received etc.Thanks!",

            "answer": "Thank you for your response. The alkaline phosphatase levels I was talking about was the isoenzymes. It states the alkaline phosphatase was 165 and the liver was 103 reference range 0 to 94. The bone was normal at 37. I usually get around 6 bladder and kidney infections a year all are treated with antibiotics. I had a pituitary tumor that was removed two years ago, after the surgery I had to take ddavp medication.I took that for about four months. I also had an ectopic pregnancy about four years ago and my right ovary was removed. My blood pressure is a little elevated, I have high irregular heartbeats. I am always tired. I hope this is enough information.Thank you",
