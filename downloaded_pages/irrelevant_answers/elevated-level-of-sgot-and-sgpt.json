            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you have a flight to catch, you can. Eat light. Avoid fatty food and alcohol as this may precipitate a liver problem. Also do not do any strenuous exercise.Many a times AST (SGOT)and ALT OR SGPT (both are collectively called transaminases) rise without any cause. Because AST is found in many other organs besides the liver, including the kidneys, the muscles, and the heart, having a high level of AST does not always (but often does) indicate that there is a liver problem. For example, even vigorous exercise may elevate AST levels in the body. However to reach at that conclusion the medical causes of these raised transaminases have to be ruled out. Causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. Steatosis and cirrhosis are ruled out by the ultrasound. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia and thyroid disease, can also cause liver transaminase elevations. Most liver diseases are characterized by greater ALT elevations than AST elevations except cirrohsis and alcohol abuse. In your case this is the picture.Having said all this, it would be best to consult a doctor as soon as possible. Maybe consult the present one before catching the flight.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hello, I've had a steady increase of SGOT and SGPT levels from my blood tests.A week ago it was SGOT-141, SGPT-130, and I had some other infection so the doctor prescribed a range of antibiotics.But I've had another blood test today and the SGOT-110 with SGPT-218.Is this serious enough to seek medical help immediately? The reason I am asking is that I have a flight to catch tonight, so will this wait 2-3 days or is this an emergency situation?Thank you!",
