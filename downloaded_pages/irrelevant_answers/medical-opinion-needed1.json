            "answer": "Hello..Well I'm not a Doctor yet I have alot of things you also have. You said you have SLE? So do I\u00a0\u00a0and three other people in my family had it too. I'm thinking that the sunburn rash might be a lupus rash. Do you use a suntan lotion that is at least spf 50 and above? With SLE the lotion must be put on all over your body first thing in the morning and reapplied several times a dayThe nausea,tingling and burnbing in your toes and fingers sound like to me a diabetic problem, that is why I have those symptoms. Lately I have even been woken up because I am itching from head to toe my Rheumo Doctors tell me that is from my Lupus and Fibro.I have had Renal problems infact I lost my right kidney in 2007, believe me you will know if your kidneys are bothering you..OUCH!!!I hope I helpped you even though I am not a Doctor.",

            "answer": "Hi & thank you so much for your reply, doctor or not.\u00a0\u00a0It's reassuring to know that I'm not alone. I empathize with you and share your pain. If you suffer like I do, I'm sure you have those days where you just want to lock and load.\u00a0\u00a0However, it appears as though you have gone through much more than I have. I'm sure your loss of kidney was due to the Lupus, and the itching we're suffering from, my guess is because of the over active nerves associated with Fibro. Has your Rheumo made any assessments as far as treating it?\u00a0\u00a0With the Sprue, I have to be so careful of what I put on my skin. For example, I cannot use Aveeno products. I was watching an older episode of NCIS and Mark Harmon suggested baking soda and vinegar paste for poison ivy. Maybe I should give that a try...lol\u00a0\u00a0I had lab work today to test my glucose levels and for a possible kidney infection/uti. I should know something in a day or two. The electric shock and burning sensation to my fingers and toes is what has me baffled. In the meantime, the itches are somewhat better, but have not totally subsided.\u00a0\u00a0How are you feeling?",

    "question": "Hi, I am a 48 yr.old female living with SLE. fibromyalgia. celiatic sprue, and arthritis. All of course resulting in depression and sleep disturbances. In addition to the sunburn rash I have on a daily basis to my chest, I have just recently been diagnosed with a skin disease known as granuloma annulare, cause unknown, but\u00a0\u00a0possibly related to a diabetic rash.\u00a0\u00a0I also have had a reoccurring out break of extreme itches from head to toe. I'm also experiencing nausea, along with\u00a0\u00a0tingling and burning sensations to my toes and fingers. My concern is if this can be diabetes or a kidney related condition or just symptoms resulting from my preexisting conditions? Thank you :)",
