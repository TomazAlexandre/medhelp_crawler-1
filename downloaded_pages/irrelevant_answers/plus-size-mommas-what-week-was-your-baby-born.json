            "answer": "I am also obese.\u00a0\u00a0I was with all three of my pregnancies since I am only 5' even, it is easy to become obese.I had my daughter at 38 weeks exactly (water broke) she was 6lbs 9oz had my son at 37 weeks exactly (started labor at 36w 5d) he was 6lbs 13oz and then had my last daughter at 37w 3d (started labor) and she was 7lbs 6oz.I never went past 38 weeks with my babies.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure if that is weight related or not but I was happy :)All three of my kids were healthy and good size.I had gestational diabetes with all three.\u00a0\u00a0Had insulin with my son and last daughter.\u00a0\u00a0I could not get my sugars controlled with my last pregnancy no matter what I did.\u00a0\u00a0They were concerned she was going to be very large so they made me do a c-section but she was 7lbs.\u00a0\u00a0Granted she was 2 1/2 weeks early technically but still either way I wish I could have tried natural.Hope everything is going well!",

    "question": "Hey Everyone, I am just wondering if fluffy mommas have their babies earlier or normal as compared to average size moms. I am almost 23 weeks, have diabetes, am obese, and a history of episodic HBP (relating to stress and asthmatic episodes, so only for a couple hours at a time).I am just wondering where other plus size moms had their babies. If you could let me know that would be amazing. Thanks.",
