Whatever is causing the stress and tension must be addressed. Doing so will help his levels. In any case, he must also make lifestyle changes; adhere to proper diabetic nutrition, maintain proper body weight, and perform daily physical exercise. These, along with medication, help with lowering glucose levels.Google diabetes side effects, print them out and hand it to him. They are not myths and do not go away if ignored. If he works hard at lowering his glucose levels he has a good chance of living a normal life.",
