            "answer": "Some women just have bigger babies. My mom had 10lbs babies and she did not have diabetes and was and still is perfectly healthy. I am a first time mom also and have been measuring ahead by 2 or 3 weeks also.\u00a0\u00a0My diabetes test came back negative. They monitor me a bit more closely and I have had 4 ultrasounds to make sure I don't have too much or too little fluid around the baby but overall I just think some women have bigger babies or just measure larger. If it's a real concern your doctor would let you know, hope you don't have diabetes and everything will go fine :)",

    "question": "Yesterday: I had an ultrasound done today to check on the baby because of my health issues from the past. The baby is measuring 4 weeks bigger than what he should. I am 26+3wks and my baby boy is measuring 30wks and is weighing 3lbs! Should I be worried about this? I am still waiting on the results of the Gestational Diabetes test that I took Friday.Today: well went to the doctor and the stomach measurements that they do is measuring at 31wks.Should I be worried about having the baby early or is it normal to measure bigger? My doctor has not changed my due date since day one; should she have changed it being I am measuring way bigger?",
