            "answer": "I've never been a thirsty person, but one of my severe symptoms when I got hit hard by Lyme was big thirst:\u00a0\u00a0I was parched.I believe it was because the Lyme bugs were messing with my electrolytes (magnesium) and throwing my body chemicals out of whack, and in a desperate attempt to sort itself out, my body said \"DRINK!\"\u00a0\u00a0Two trips to the ER with heart irregularities were each 'cured' by a IV drip of water with electrolytes, and I felt fine.\u00a0\u00a0I was the one who figured out much later that my electrolytes were still out of whack, when I realized I felt better after drinking this stuff called vitamin water [now made by coca cola] that lots of people trash as being like koolaid, but read the labels, it does have electrolytes, and that's what I realized was making me feel better.\u00a0\u00a0I like the 'rescue' flavor best.\u00a0\u00a0Yes it has sugar in it.\u00a0\u00a0So shoot me.\u00a0\u00a0I also now take magnesium and potassium supplements.My not so nice doctor, who is really smart but not so good with people, decided that the reason for my two trips to the ER was all in my head and told me I was simply drinking too much water and to slow it down, that I was bringing this on myself.\u00a0\u00a0The technical term is 'psychogenic polydipsia' and is a mental disorder, but of course he wouldn't tell me the name of what he thought.\u00a0\u00a0He doubled my HRT and told me to stop drinking so much water.==>>\u00a0\u00a0Turns out I had Lyme and babesiosis.He is of course now my FORMER doctor.\u00a0\u00a0(Oh, and he told me to drink less water and try Gatorade, but beware of Gatorade, because its electrolytes don't match what the body needs.\u00a0\u00a0Read the labels.)SO MY POINT IS:\u00a0\u00a0you may be thirsty if your magnesium levels are low?\u00a0\u00a0blood tests for magnesium levels are not helpful, because your body will use up its hidden supplies of magnesium to keep your blood levels normal, and although there are tests for intracellular [inside the cells, not in the bloodstream] magnesium, most doctors won't use them.\u00a0\u00a0So any blood test you get that says your magnesium levels are okay is not necessarily the last word.\u00a0\u00a0Try supplementing and seeing if you feel less thirsty.And on that note, I tried magnesium oxide pills, and they worked fine.\u00a0\u00a0I read that magnesium citrate was more 'bio-available', meaning easier for the body to absorb, so I tried that next.\u00a0\u00a0The Mg Citrate is much harsher on my stomach and gives me heart burn, so I'm going back to the Mg Oxide as soon as I use up the Mg Citrate.\u00a0\u00a0Just a few ideas ....",

            "answer": "Well this isn't easy (3 years answers and 3 no answers) ! I would guess that the only real difference then between CFS and lyme is the fatigue. CFS patients have postexertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours (exhaustion and increased symptoms) following physical or mental exercise. But there are lyme patients who also have these symptoms. Like Jackie said, we could have more than one infection.",
