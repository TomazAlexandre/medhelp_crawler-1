            "answer": "Things like this needs to come as they do. The ultra sound will be your best ool to really know whats happening..Is this a nodule or a goiter? HAs the doctor said?and with the thyroglobulin tests coming back positive it most likely is autoimmune.If I were you get ahead of the game and research some Hashimoto disease information and get well equipped with an understanding on the whole situation.I will give you a heads up that in most Hashimoto cases - regular thyroid labs can come back \"normal\" but in reality they are not. Studying the Free T3 and Free T4 labs would be best and make sure you get those done each time when you test. The TSh is very tricky and not a great responder to the disease when Hashi is present.This is a very hard disease to manage if you do not have a skilled doctor in the thyroid specialty experience.",

            "answer": "Thanks. :) They still haven't gotten back to me yet. I called them today and they still haven't looked at my test results. A technician did the test itself so she couldn't say anything. The doctor said it was a nodule, but that was back in July. The lump wasn't noticeable to be back then (or I thought it was a swollen gland) but now its gotten much larger.",

    "question": "I'm a 19 y/o female. I weigh about 124 pounds. I have recently been feeling very tired and fatigued all the time. I also have lost over 7 pounds with out trying. My mom convinced me to see my doctor. He felt small lump (a nodule?) on my thyroid. He ordered lots of tests to be done. He tested for diabetes, pregnancy, mono, hypo/hyperthyroidism, and a couple other things that I can't recall. They all came back negative. The only thing that was off was my thyroglobulin levels. (I believe that is what they are called) The lump on my thyroid has gotten bigger, now it is slightly noticeable. It is tender sometimes. My doctor is having me get an ultrasound of my thyroid on the 25th. He wanted it done a week ago but I had left for my vacation. I might also have a biopsy done. I am really scared because I don't know what to expect and I am afraid of what they might find. What can i expect? Anything will be greatly appreciated. Thanks! :-)",
