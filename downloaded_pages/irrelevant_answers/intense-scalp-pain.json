    "question": "I didn't really know where to put this, soo...I'm not sure what's going on, but right now it feels like my scalp is on fire. I'm not sure if it's been coming on for a few days or not, but today I know that the pain is awful. There haven't been any severe changes in my routine except that I've been a tiny bit stressed about work but it isn't anything too bad.My scalp is very sensitive to the touch right now and the weight of my hair is causing me really intense pain. I've also been noticing a couple of bruises on my arms and legs that I don't remember getting.Seriously in agony. I don't have health insurance for another two months or so and I don't know what I'm going to do if this continues - it is seriously distracting.I should probably mention that I haven't been eating great the last three weeks after eating very well and losing a little over 20 pounds, but I'm switching back to eating healthy as of today. I work in a coffee shop so sometimes have to use weird cleaning chemicals but I haven't used any in the last three days. I'm just trying to think of everything that could cause this. I've been using the same shampoo for about 5 or 6 weeks.",
