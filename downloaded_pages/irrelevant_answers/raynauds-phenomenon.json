            "answer": "From what I understand Raynauds is a syndrome that makes your fingers turn blue during temp. changes. Such as handling ice or being outside during snow. There is most likely a medical condition that cause Raynauds. Since you are always cold have your thyroid checked yearly and if TSH shows normal ask doctor to perform other tests TSH is not always accurate. Mean time google Tyroid Problems and check your symtoms against the list for hypothroidism, and hypertyroidism. Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!There can be several causes like hypothyroidism, liver diseases, adrenal insufficiency, liver failure and as a side effect of some drugs. Chills are also felt when a fever is about to start in case of malaria and bacterial infections due to release of toxins. One can also feel chilled if you are about to break into viral fever.The hands could be cold due to reduced blood supply as in diabetes, carpal tunnel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, poor sleep, smoking, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon and pinched cervical spinal nerve.Please discuss this with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
