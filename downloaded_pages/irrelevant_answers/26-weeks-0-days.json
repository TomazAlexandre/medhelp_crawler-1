Start walking everyday for Atleast 30 min.\u00a0\u00a0and if you haven't worked out yet then gradually start doing squats, leg work, arm work, and light aerobics. But don't push yourself,\u00a0\u00a0take lots of breaks, drink lots of water and check your heart rate often. You don't want it to go to high. That's what I have been doing my whole pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0:)",
