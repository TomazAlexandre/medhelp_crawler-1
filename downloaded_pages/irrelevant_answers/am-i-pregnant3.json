            "answer": "Sounds like you could can an eptopic preg. it grows in the ovarian tubes and can burst the tube the bigger it grows the cells think they are in the uterine area they still grow and will give off signs of being impregnated. I would get to an obgyn as soon as you can if your underage go to a hosp or clinic they will be discreet and guide you. Hopefully you can talk to your parents about this. I understand if you dont or beyond that age. I would do something quickly. good luck",

            "answer": "I don't know if its eptopic, most women who experience that are in a world of pain and hcg levels are normally through the roof. Some women do not read up the first couple months on pregnancy tests. Or you may have a lot stress in your life that has delayed your period, hyper thyroidism, and diabetes can for sure throw things out of whack. If you feel you're really pregnant have the gyno do a pelvic exam and an ultrasound. Good luck!",
