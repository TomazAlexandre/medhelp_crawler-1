    "question": "So I went to the oral surgeon yesterday, and he said that while my bone is still exposed he thinks the best thing to do is send me home with no packing see if it improves on its own, he said to wait 3-4 days and if there is still pain we will do the scraping thing.OK, so I'm no doctor, but I can't get rid off the thought that a persons bone should not be exposed to bacteria. My mom is freaking out, telling me that if my bone gets infected they may have to remove some of it, but common sense is telling me that this doctor can't be that wrong, right?What are the symptoms of a bone infection? (besides pain, which has not gone away) Would you send a patient home with an open socket, straight down to the bone?And to answer your questions in my other thread, yes they have checked the other teeth, and can't find any problems. And, no I don't smoke.",
