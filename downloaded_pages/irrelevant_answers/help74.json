            "answer": "Hi I too have PCOS and I just started Metformin 4 days ago!I also take provera to get my period and Clomid to induce ovulation (has not worked yet)In my 3rd round nowThe most common side effect is diarrhea!\u00a0\u00a0What MG did the doc start you on....my doc gave me 500mg said to take 1 pill a day for 1-2 weeks and then move up to 2 pills a day for a total of 1000mg a day!\u00a0\u00a0I do have some diarrhea from this but not bad at all, and if you read below there are plenty of reasons to just DEAL with the side effects!Here is the article i just read, that has helped me with the decision to take metformin!HOPE THIS HELPS YOU!Metformin is a drug sold under the brand name Glucophage and Glucophage XR. It is primarily used to treat type 2 diabetes \u2013 the non-insulin dependent diabetes. People with Type 2 diabetes do not make enough insulin or do not respond normally to the insulin their bodies make. This causes glucose, or sugar, to build up in the blood stream, which can cause serious damage to the body. Similarly, women with PCOS commonly have insulin resistance, a condition wherein extra insulin is needed in order to transport glucose into the blood stream where it belongs. High levels of glucose or insulin in the blood stream can cause obesity, infertility, heart disease and diabetes.The main goal of Metformin is to lower blood sugar levels to normal. It does this by decreasing the amount of sugar made by your liver, decreasing the amount of sugar absorbed by your intestines and by helping your body better process the insulin it makes.Metformin does not cause your body to make more insulin. In this way, Metformin is different from other glucose-control medications which control blood sugar by causing the body to release more of its own insulin. For this reason, Metformin rarely causes hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or weight gain.Metformin can Help Women with Insulin Resistance or PCOS Lose WeightMetformin is commonly prescribed for insulin resistance and polycystic ovarian syndrome, or PCOS. Metformin combined with a low carbohydrate diet and exercise program has been shown to help women with PCOS or insulin resistance lose weight. In one study, 22 morbidly obese women with PCOS who were treated with Metformin for 24 weeks lost an average of 6% of their body weight (18 pounds) and had a 10% increase in their LDL and a 10% decrease in their fasting insulin levels. This weight loss was attributed to the resolution of insulin resistance provided by Metformin. In the same study, those who continued on Metformin after one year maintained their weight loss while those who stopped Metformin regained 50% of their weight. Another study showed that women who continued on Metformin following their weight loss, maintained that loss for 2 to 4 years.Metformin can Restore MenstruationMetformin restores menstruation. In a study of 43 women with PCOS who were not having their periods, 39 of them resumed menstruation while taking Metformin. In another study, 11 teenage girls with PCOS were given Metformin and a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet and 10 of them resumed normal menses.Metformin Increases Fertility in Women with PCOSMetformin increases fertility in women with insulin resistance and/or PCOS. PCOS is known to prevent ovulation and conception. Women with PCOS who do conceive often suffer from miscarriages within the first three months of pregnancy. However, in one study of 118 women with PCOS who took Metformin, 91% ovulated and conceived normally. In that same study, 60 of the women took Metformin throughout their pregnancy and over 90% of them gave birth to healthy babies. Metformin falls into FDA category B, which means it is not expected to be harmful to an unborn child but has not been tested and approved for use by pregnant women. Metformin has been found in breast milk when taken while breastfeeding. If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, talk to your health care provider before starting on Metformin.Metformin Helps Reduce the Risk of MiscarriageMetformin reduces the risk of miscarriage. Women with PCOS are at a high risk of repeated miscarriages. However, in a study of women who took Metformin while pregnant only 8.8% of them suffered miscarriages while the non-Metformin group suffered miscarriages at a rate of 41.9%. In the same study, 11.1% of the Metformin group who suffered miscarriages had miscarried before while 58.3% of the non-Metformin group who suffered miscarriages had miscarried before.Metformin Reduces the Risk of Developing Gestational DiabetesStudies show that women with PCOS who conceive while taking Metformin or who took it throughout their pregnancy were less likely to develop gestational diabetes.Metformin Reduces Testosterone Levels in Women with PCOSMetformin reduces testosterone levels in women with PCOS. In one study of 24 obese women with PCOS, the 11 who were given Metformin had a reduction in insulin levels, which slowed production of an enzyme in the ovaries that affects the production of testosterone. Metformin was also found to reduce levels of testosterone in non-obese women.Metformin Prevents or Delays the Onset of DiabetesMetformin prevents or delays the onset of diabetes. Studies show that 70% of women who suffer from PCOS eventually develop type 2 diabetes. In one study, however, Metformin decreased the development of diabetes by 31%.Other Benefits of MetforminMetformin may help increase the success of in vitro fertilization, may help lower cholesterol levels and may improve energy levels.Of course, like any drug, Metformin has many potential side effects. The most common side effect is gastrointestinal upset, which usually only occurs during the first few weeks of taking Metformin. Other side effects include, but are not limited to, general malaise, a temporary metallic taste, vitamin B12 malabsorption, and lactic acidosis. It is important to be aware of these potential side effects when taking Metformin.Metformin is the Miracle Drug for Women with PCOSMetformin is not yet approved for the treatment of PCOS but is commonly prescribed for that purpose. As indicated above, numerous studies found Metformin to be helpful in resolving many of the major symptoms of PCOS. No other drug is currently available for the treatment of PCOS. If you are suffering from PCOS or insulin resistance, talk to you health care provider about Metformin.",

            "answer": "Hi, I too have PCOS. I was diagnosed at the beginning of this year. I have been on metformin for several months now and my feelings for it are somewhat mixed :)To be honest since I started the metformin I have had a few side effects, it's nothing I can't hadle thou! You MAY get nauseous the first few days/week, but usually your body will adjust to it and you will slowly no longer feel the nausea or possible not as intense. As for myself I seem to do fine for a few weeks then I get nauseous and have to stop taking it to feel better, But again this is my experience and according to my Dr, is not a \"common\" side effect. You MAY also get diarrhea, this too is a side effect I feel, however it is not too terrible. I would start slowly. My Dr. is great and started me on 1/2 tablet of 500mg/a day then after a week bumped it up to a whole tablet...so on and so on. I am now at 500mg/day 2x/day, but your dr. will tell you whats best for you.Another think I have doubts about is I have not yet received a menstrual cycle on my own yet. I need provera or something like it to force start, but again this is not how everyone reacts to it. I have heard a lot of women menstrate on their own right away. Each women is different. There are other things metformin can help with. I have not seen a weight change, however some women lose weight easier on it. It won't cause weight loss on its own, however it can balance your out to where you lose it easier. This is something, I myself, have not experienced. I would advise you to reasearch it a little bit so you have a heads up on what to expect.Also, try, try, try to stay positive. This is something that is hard for me. The moment I get nauseaous I stop taking it and get discouraged, try not to do that. I feel that if I could stick it out, I would be very much used to it.Another thing is get support! Either at home or on here, OR BOTH :) It is so nice to get encouragment and the girls on here have an endless supply of it! Ask questions, add friends and post how you are doing. Or just let everyone know you need a little encouragment. We know how you feel and that kind of support is the best kind. You can also email me if you have any other questions. PCOS ***** and can be hard, but there is a reason only us girls get it. ;)",

            "answer": "I have been on metformin for a year now and at first it takes some getting used to.you can get headaches, diarrhea,\u00a0\u00a0nuasea, Upset stomach. I noticed that when I kept myself busy the side affects like headaches and nuasea went away. And if I didnt let myself get hungry it helped alot. The good news is that once your body gets used to it it goes away. So just get throuhg the first week or two and it will be better. It helps you get pregnant but by minimizing some of the other symptoms of PCOS. It could take awhile to work but it will help you in the end. Good luck",

I drink alcohol too much, so I have to stop. I think if you take the two together on a consistent bases for a long time you will have problems.Metformin and Alcoholis generally recommended that people not use metformin and alcohol at the same time. Taking metformin and alcohol together can increase your risk of developing a life-threatening condition called lactic acidosis. However, drinking small amounts of alcohol should not be a problem for most people taking the medication. Before taking metformin, be sure to talk to your healthcare provider about drinking alcohol while taking the drug.",

            "answer": "Understanding Lactic AcidosisLactic acidosis is a life-threatening condition caused by too much lactate in the blood and low blood pH. Low blood pH means that your blood contains too much acid, which can be harmful to the cells of your body.Lactic acidosis is a very dangerous condition and is fatal in about 50 percent of cases. Risk factors for lactic acidosis when taking metformin include:\u2022Having kidney problems, including kidney failure (renal failure)\u2022Having liver problems, including liver failure or cirrhosis\u2022Having congestive heart failure (CHF)\u2022Having a procedure using contrast dye (see Metformin and Contrast Medium)\u2022Drinking large amounts of alcohol on a regular basis (see Metformin and Alcohol)\u2022Drinking a large amount of alcohol at one time (binge drinking).",

            "answer": "Lactic Acidosis SymptomsBecause lactic acidosis is so dangerous, you should immediately report any lactic acidosis symptoms to your healthcare provider. Symptoms of lactic acidosis include:\u2022Feeling tired or weak\u2022Muscle pain\u2022Trouble breathing\u2022Abdominal pain (or stomach pain)\u2022Feeling cold\u2022Cold or blue hands and feet\u2022Dizziness or lightheadedness\u2022A slow or irregular heartbeat\u2022Persistent nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain\u2022Shortness of breath\u2022An enlarged or tender liver\u2022Weight loss.How Common Is Lactic Acidosis With Metformin?Taking metformin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is extremely rare; about three people out of every 100,000 people taking metformin will develop lactic acidosis over a one-year period. However, your risk for developing lactic acidosis might be much higher, depending on whether you have other risk factors for lactic acidosis.Treating Lactic AcidosisLactic acidosis is treated by stopping metformin. You may need to be hospitalized. Some people with lactic acidosis need intravenous (IV) fluids and a machine to help them breathe. Some doctors recommend giving riboflavin (vitamin B2), thiamine (vitamin B1), coenzyme Q, L-carnitine, or vitamins C, E, and K to patients with lactic acidosis, but the effectiveness of these treatments is uncertain.You should not stop taking metformin without talking with your healthcare provider, even if you have symptoms of lactic acidosis. If you are diagnosed with lactic acidosis, you and your doctor will decide how to stop your medications, when to restart medications, and which ones to take when you go back to treatment.",
