            "answer": "Without a complete history, physical exam, lab review and medication list, I can\u2019t give you an exact diagnosis or treatment plan. Since you haven\u2019t mentioned anything, I am assuming you\u2019re a relatively healthy patient without diabetes and without anything wrong with your kidneys (your creatinine is normal?) and without any abnormality on the EKG.Usually, in these cases of a young healthy person, the most common cause of an isolated elevated potassium level is \u201cpseudohyperkalemia\u201d or spurious hyperkalemia.\u00a0\u00a0Potassium is a major ion of the body. Nearly 98% of potassium is intracellular, meaning contained within the cells of the body. What happens is that during the blood draw or in the laboratory tube, some of the cells rupture, leaking potassium into the serum.\u00a0\u00a0This causes a high value of potassium to be measured in the serum, which doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect what is truly in your extra-cellular space.Therefore you may consider eating a low-potassium diet (potassium is present in bananas, oranges, high-protein diets, tomatoes, salt substitutes) and avoiding any medications such as NSAIDs prior to getting your potassium level redrawn in a couple weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Diet and some medications can contribute to an acutely elevated potassium level.",
