    "question": "I'm 22 y.o. I've been urinating frequently in the past 2-3 years as far as I can remember (possibly longer than that). But I also noticed that I only tend do to that when I drink excessively compared to other people, so there are days where I urinate normally (which are usually the day where I drink less water). Recently I read that it's the one of the most common symptoms of prostate cancer among with difficulty of urinating and burning sentation/pain during urinating which I've experienced sometimes. It got me real scared.3.5 years ago I did the medical check up for study overseas, there were blood test and urine test. But I don't know if prostate cancer can be detected by any of these test. The result was fine, only they found too much albumin in my urine (I don't know what it means but I didn't bother to take any further test.So my question is once you have prostate cancer, do the symptoms appear occasionally or regularly?There is no cancer in my family medical history. There was never blood in my semen or urine. But occasionally I feel burning sensation , once in a while I have difficulty in starting urination (often because I got an urge to defecate at the same time.I've heard these are also the symptoms of diabetes. Do they sound more like it?",
