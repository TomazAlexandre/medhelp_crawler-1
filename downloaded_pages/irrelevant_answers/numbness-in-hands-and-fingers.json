            "answer": "Hello,Numbness and tingling are abnormal sensations that can occur anywhere in your body, but are often felt in your hands, feet, arms, or legs.Many causes of numbness in the hands and fingers are there. These include injury to the back or spinal cord, lack of blood supply to the legs as a result of plaque formation in the blood vessels,carpal tunnel syndrome, motor neurone disease,diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis,rheumatoid arthritis and underactive thyroid. Abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body and a lack of vitamin B12 can also cause tingling in the arms,hands and fingers.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the numbness is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder.Various investigations will be required to confirm a diagnosis.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",
