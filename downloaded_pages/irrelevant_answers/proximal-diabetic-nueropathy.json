            "answer": "Thank you WaveRider for your comment on this and for the added link.I will be getting info from a physical therapist about exercises I can help my husband with shortly and we will begin as soon as the Dr says it is safe to do so. Having to wait because of blood clots in his weakest leg.I'm just trying to learn all I can before hand so I will have what ever might be needed on hand. Also my daughter is going to let me\u00a0\u00a0practice exercises on her in the meantime.We do gentle massage at this time and I have to be very careful as he has lost so much weight and has almost no muscle left on his body. He has gone from a 36 waist to a 32. I hate to think how little he weights now! Sometimes I have to pretend to take the dogs out when I have the need to break and cry, it hurts so much to watch him go down so. I try hard to be up beat for him. He is depressed enough as it is without my adding to it. I watch his diet carefully which has been complicated diabetes and heart condition.I monitor his sugar, temp and blood pressure several times a day.I value any and all info.",
