            "answer": "If you have a pituitary tumor that is putting pressure on your optic nerves then you are risking your sight among other things to not see a Dr. I have a pituitary condition myself and if you have adrenal insufficiency as a result of a pit. tumor, it could be very dangerous. The thing to worry about (if it is a pit tumor) is if and how fast it is growing. In any case you need to have bloodtests and MRI to see what is going on in your head. If you are low income you may not have to pay to be seen at a hospital. Your symptoms do sound pituitary. It is a real danger so please see a Dr.!",

            "answer": "If you think you have a pituitary tumor, you must see a Dr. This can affect many body systems. In addition, if you lose vision while driving, you could kill yourself and your child. Apply for medicaid. Some states also have a special program for adults that will cover all of your expenses above a certain deductible. You must have an MRI. As far as the extreme thirst, look up Diabetes Insipidus. This is not the same as true diabetes. The symptoms just seem like diabetes. It is caused by damage to the pituitary, or pituitary tumor. This could all be very serious, and you really have to go to a doctor. The sooner the better.",

    "question": "About a year ago I was toold to go see a neuroligist about ice cold feet and poor circulation in lower legs..and about bouts of blindness. I lost my insurance before my appt though, and was unable to go. I did see an opthamolagist, and he said my eyes were fine.I am 24 yrs old and of normal weight.I haven't had any bouts of blindness since. Well about a week ago it happened again. I was walking out of my bedroom, and all of the sudden everything went black..like two curtains closing on each side..it only lasted for about 30 seconds or so...but this is not normal and Itis very scary when it happens. I've also been having a nipple discharge, for no known reason..I am not preganant...I typed all these symptoms in and googled it...It said Prolactin pituitary tumor (usually benign). I read on and many of the symptoms I have. Extreme thirst,fatigue, irregualr periods, visual disturbances,nipple discharge.headaches,ect..I don't currently have any insurance..and I have a 2 year old daughter , therefore I cannot afford to go see a dr. My question is ..has anyone ever had or known someone with this condition...and if so is there any real danger ??",
