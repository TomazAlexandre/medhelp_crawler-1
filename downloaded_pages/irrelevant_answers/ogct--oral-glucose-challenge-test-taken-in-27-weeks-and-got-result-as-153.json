            "answer": "If you don't pass your 3hr then the doc will decide the best course of action for you (based on how high your numbers were). Treatment of gestational diabetes can range from just a modified diet to oral medication to insulin; it varies depending upon the severity of the diabetes, access to medication depending upon where you live, the doc's preferences, and what the patient can tolerate.I've had gestational diabetes with all three of my pregnancies. With my first I was on insulin, my second was just a modified diet, and with my third I'm on oral medication. Having gestational diabetes really stinks, but it could be worse. Keep your chin up and do what you have to do to keep you and baby healthy! Best of luck to you!!",
