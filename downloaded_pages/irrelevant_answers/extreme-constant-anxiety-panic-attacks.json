    "question": "Hello,I have been in a state of literally constant worry/panic for nearly a year now.\u00a0\u00a0I have always been a hypochondriac.\u00a0\u00a0In 10th grade I got 2 MRI's because I was convinced I had a tumor.\u00a0\u00a0A year ago I had an ill advised sexual encounter and as a result was convinced for 7 months that I had caught an STD despite 5 rounds of negative testing.\u00a0\u00a0I know now that I did not and I am fine, but the feeling of extreme anxiety is still there, round the clock, and when something that SHOULD induce anxiety comes along I have a panic attack because my background anxiety level is so high to begin with that the added anxiety overloads my system.\u00a0\u00a0Ironically, I am now worried that I have developed some kind of heart problem as I have heard that extreme stress can mess up your heart.\u00a0\u00a0My left arm feels constricted, I have chest pressure, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I would probably find the irony in this mildly amusing if I could find anything amusing at all.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't truly enjoyed anything in almost a year and this anxiety is heavily affecting my grades.Through all this I have somehow managed to develop a relationship with a girl that I really like, and who for some inexplicable reason likes me.\u00a0\u00a0Instead of helping with my stress level, this relationship adds to it.\u00a0\u00a0I am constantly worried that this problem will hurt our relationship, and I am reluctant to get intimate for fear that those STD tests were wrong and that I might give her an STD which would probably send me into an abyss of depression and anxiety that I don't think I could recover from.\u00a0\u00a0I realize that all of this is irrational and unfounded, but that does not make a difference.What the hell am I supposed to do?\u00a0\u00a0I am reluctant to see a doctor because one of my friends was prescribed benzos and became an addict.\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to end up like him, but if I don't do something about this its going to start hurting my relationships with other people... I have been able to hide my problem from others for a long time but I can't keep this up much longer.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like my chest will explode.Any advice?",
