            "answer": "Same thing happening to me. Started a year ago with pins & needles in hands. Then went all over my body. Eventually, it got so intense that the pins & needles seem like hundreds more and it's now feeling like terrible stinging. I also get heat from it. My skin hurts and I feel cold inside and hot outside of my skin and vise versa. It wakes me up at night and it's hard to breath since it's so intense. I don't know what's happening to me. I'm leaning towards something auto-immune since I have a positive RA Factor. We can both use assistance.Going for an EMG and SSEP from my neurologist. I also have arthritis in all joints and spine.",

            "answer": "your all having a panic attack... i came on this forum a while back before i knew these symptoms you all share were just those of anxiety, and the comments here just made me even more frightened, some of you jsut overdo it by bringing in your neuropathy and other stupid suggestions that i followed and brought me no progress whatsoever. just get in touch with a psychologist, who will simply educate you on what a panic attack is, why your experiencing them, and most importantly, how it can never kill you. Once you understand that these, ill admit quite frigtening symptoms, are just infact your body reacting to your stress and anxiety, than these bodily sensations wont seem so scarey/even life threatening anymore, and you wont assume the worst and think its going to ruin your life, because in actual fact its this pessimism which makes you develop such a panic disorder that has haunted some of the posters here for several years, instead youll know just to take a few deep breathes and understand that these sensations will go away once you calm down and will never come back again, except sometimes in moments of extreme stress, but thats normal were human beings in the strenueous age of the 21st century. hope my experience can help anyone that felt what i felt, and completely overcome it just like i did, cheers.",

    "question": "I'm having this weird pain on my skin. First it started on my tight. Later it's speading out all over the whole body. I've experienced tingling/numbness in my toes, fingertips and now spread all to other part of body. My feet are cold. Some time I had a heat type sensation on my leg. Then little sharp pain like electric shock sesantion on my tight, feet. But it hurts and can last for a few minutes. My clothing felt like sandpaper on my body. Most of the time it feels like stinging/pins or needles...I tried to find on the internet for any similar symtomp but can't find it so far. I had a dr appointment last Friday and she said it's a virus which similar with cold, so she suggested to take Motrin, Advil. i've been taking the med for 3 days but it didn't do any good. Now it gets worst. I can feel the stinging/shot running all over, even on my tongue, eyes, gum, throat. it caused the blurry my left eyes, and my tooth hurt so much that i can't bite some time.Besides this tingling/burn/sharp pain i don't have any fever, tireness or any kind of symtomp indicating I'm sick.Have any of you know any one that have the same symtomp? I desperately want to know how do they deal with it, and what is the disease?",
