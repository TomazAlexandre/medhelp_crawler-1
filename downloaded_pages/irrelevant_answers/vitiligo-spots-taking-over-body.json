    "question": "Hi, I am a 53 yr. old female, in good health, except for some digestion problems. About 9 years ago, I noticed faint white spots on both thumbs. Over the past 9 years it has progressed rapidly. I have on hands arms, shins, and back of neck, under eyes, and at corners of mouth. Stress seems to make it grow. In 1986 I had papillary thyroid cancer, surgery, then radioactive iodine. Since then, I have been taking Synthroid.I was wondering if you have any suggestions.Thanks,Alice",
