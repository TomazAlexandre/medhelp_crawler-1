            "answer": "Hi,TSH is not a really good measure of thyroid function.She obviously needs to be on thyroid meds regardless of what the TSH says - as her symptoms and FT4 clearly point to being hypothyroid.Does she have diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0For many people with diabetes (especially) TSH is apparently even less useful than normal (as a screening tool).",

        {
            "answer": "Yes, I believe she shoul be on meds.FT3 and FT4 should always be used as the gold standard by which to treat and medicate hypothyroid.TSH is sometimes helpful, but more often than not just confuses the picture as those doctors who only look as TSH may completely miss that a patient really is hypothyroid.Actually proper diagnosis takes into account symptoms and signs, FT3 and FT4, and only then TSH (and only if it's congruent with what everything else says).",

            "answer": "At the very worst I would want to repeat her labs (Ft3, FT4, TSH and the antibodies that weren't done) in 2 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0IF Ft3 and FT4 were still low end of range or below range I would start her on low dose thyroid meds and observe and retest after 6 weeks for further adjustment, with target being to get FT3 and FT4 at least middle of the reference range.",
