            "answer": "If the double vision resolved with prisms, it is due to a muscle imbalance and not the lens in the eye.\u00a0\u00a0Most likely source of all his problems is the diabetic damage to the back of the eyes.\u00a0\u00a0Can't comment specifically though as I have not examined his eyes.\u00a0\u00a0Your ophthalmologist should be able to explain the reason for the blurry vision.HV",

            "answer": "Just a guess, but I have had cat. SX in only one eye and now have a small amt. of double vision.\u00a0\u00a0Mine is because my IOL lens in my cataract eye put me into the myopic range -.60 ish and my other eye is in the hyperopic range +1...hence the two eyes have a hard time blending the 2 images.After several months, it got better and tolerable.\u00a0\u00a0The brain is amazing and can adapt if the diopters are less that 3 diopters apart (usually).Ask more questions...find out what your individual eye diopters are and see if that could be the issue.\u00a0\u00a0If so, perhaps give it time so your brain can do its thing by neuro-adaptation.Good luck, ask more specific questions and do some more reading.",

    "question": "My husband had a introcular bleed due to his diabetes since august. Before having a vitrectomy he had cataract surgery in early december. The end of December he had the vitrectomy. He continues to have blurred and double vision since the surgery in December. A neuropthamologist prescribed prisms on his glasses, but offered no help to his vision. He is currrently scheduled for an MRI. Is it perhaps possible that the lens from the cataract surgery may be the cause of the double and blurry vision. He has been dealing with this issue for 6 months now and I know he is frustrated and disgusted. Any suggestions would be wonderful to hear.Thank you",
