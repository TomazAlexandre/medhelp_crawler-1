            "answer": "Hi there!It may take sometime for the inflammation to settle down after initial stress following a period of disuse. The activity level would need to be increased gradually and not suddenly (which could result in acute inflammation). Physiotherapy may also be useful for the period. Meanwhile I would suggest resting the foot for a few days before re-embarking on the gradual increase in activity level. Ice-packs and tylenol/ OTC NSAIDS may be helpful for relief as well.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "Broke 3 bones, 3rd, 4th, 5th metatarsals. Its been 8 weeks. Finally in a shoe boot & out of the other cumbersome contraption. The doc said i could gradually walk up to 1 mile/ day. First day after taking off the compression stocking, why is the top of my foot all bruised, similar to when just broken? Does that mean I over did it? Called & the nurse said she doesn't know. Getting some sharp electrical like impulses intermittently in that area of my foot too. She asked if I have diabetes. NO. Maybe its nerves coming back online like when you reboot a computer??? How long before a regular shoe will fit? Foot is still swollen & have fat little sausage- link looking toes. Anyone know? Any advice to heal faster? Any advice??",
