            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is a little unusual symptom and it is tough to give a straight forward answer. There is however the possibility of nerve compression due to posture during sex. I would suggest you to try a different posture during intercourse and see if it helps. OTC B complex supplements will also help. It would be useful to get yourself evaluated for diabetes as well.Hope this helps!",

    "question": "I'm a 25 year old girl, and as of about a week ago, I have consistantly been experiencing strange cramps and numbness in my hands and arms during and after intercourse (has occurred now 5 times).\u00a0\u00a0It generally begins as a tingling (think as if a limb were falling asleep) in my fingers and toes, along with muscle twitching and cramping in my face (mild though) and rises into almost a paralysis in both arms.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds really strange, but my hands and arms become so cramped almost instantly, and they sort of lock into place like a doll or something.\u00a0\u00a0My face continues to twitch and it takes about 5 to 10 minutes for everything to \"release\".\u00a0\u00a0It isn't only when I orgasm, but it certainly is exacerbated when I do.\u00a0\u00a0I run and work out\u00a0\u00a0daily with no problem, and eat very healthy (vegetarean but still eat some fish and shellfish) so I'm not quite sure what's going on.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think it's muscular otherwise my daily workouts would be affected, right?\u00a0\u00a0Any Ideas?\u00a0\u00a0I looked on wrongdiagnosis.com and a slew of crazy diseases showed up... just wanted some real feedback- I (and my boyfriend) would really appreciate it.",
