            "answer": "I don't think that wrinkled fingers would effect her readings, but I would make sure that her fingers are dry.\u00a0\u00a0It is a good idea to have very clean hands when you are testing because residual sugar on the fingers, from anything sweet could give a false reading.\u00a0\u00a0Might I suggest testing her right before she takes a bath and then waiting maybe 15 minutes after she takes a bath.\u00a0\u00a0You will find that with diabetes you have to adjust your life and your schedule a bit but you can manage diabetes and live a very normal life.",

            "answer": "You don't mention the time of\u00a0\u00a0day that she is taking her bath. If it is after dinner (before bedtime), it is likely that her dinner insulin is peaking while she is in the bathtub, bringing her sugar low. You don't say whether the baths happen every night or not. I would be more likely to suspect that the timing of insulin peaking is the problem if it is happening every night.And yes, do make sure her hands are very dry before you test her. I have never noticed baths having any effect on glucose levels.",

            "answer": "I think the problem centers on the fac that she is on Novolog and NPH in the morning and then she is on Novolog and Lantusin the evening.\u00a0\u00a0NPH lasts 12-18 hours and Lantus lasts 18-26 hours.\u00a0\u00a0I think those doses are overlapping.\u00a0\u00a0My question to the Dr. would be why is she on Lantus and NPH??!?!?!?!?It is important to note that a diluted blood sample will produce a diluted reading.",

            "answer": "After her bath her fingers are soaked with water.\u00a0\u00a0Pricking her finger right after a bath will dilute the blood that comes out through that water soaked skin.\u00a0\u00a0If you're going to test after a bath (or after coming out of a pool), make sure the fingers are as dry as you can make them.",

            "answer": "I agree with KevinHarney. NPH insulin is an older type of insulin, and it has a VERY noticeable \"peak\" action that happens in the middle of the day, around 3 pm. I grew up on NPH and really had to watch for mid-day lows. Most doctors nowadays use Lantus alone as the long-lasting insulin and have given up NPH altogether because of the scary lows that often happen when it peaks. Most diabetics in America who take injections rather than using a pump use Lantus once or twice a day and a quick-acting insulin like Novolog before meals. We do not normally take NPH with the Lantus, for they do similar things. Once the Lantus dose is right, NPH becomes unnecessary. I would suggest that you discuss this with her endo.",

    "question": "My 6 year old daughter was diagnosed Type 1 diabetes 9 days ago.\u00a0\u00a0I am proud to say her blood sugar has been within range every time I have checked over past 5 days.\u00a0\u00a0Except...\u00a0\u00a0Her blood sugar has tested low all four times I tested either while she was in bath or just out.\u00a0\u00a0She has tested between 57 and 68.\u00a0\u00a0Is anyone aware of \"wrinkled fingers\" from exposure to water causing low blood sugar readings?\u00a0\u00a0Her bath is just luke warm not REAL hot.\u00a0\u00a0She loves her baths and I'd hate to take that away from her at this point but I must admit I am afraid of the bath.\u00a0\u00a0Could I be getting a diluted/false low result from the \"pruney\" fingers?",
