            "answer": "I have not been through this either (knock on wood.... I had my glucose screen yesterday and I'm hoping it came back normal) but had a close friend who did. She didn't have any complications besides excessive weight gain, but that can be kept under control w/proper foods and enough safe exercise. Her baby was normal size and very healthy. I had HG during the first 18 weeks and had to test w/a monitor twice a day. It was annoying but not complicated, and pretty soon it just became like second nature to check. My blood sugar ranged anywhere from 75 to 110. Generally staying between 70-120 is \"normal\" but you definitely need to clarify with your doctor to make sure. Try not to be scared about it - just relax and take care of yourself. Everything will be okay!",

            "answer": "i also had GD during my pregnancy my daughter is now 3 weeks old she was born at 39 wks and weighed 9lbs 3 oz she had to stay in the nicu because her lungs were underdeveloped becuase of the GD but as long as they catch it early and you control your sugar levels everything should be fine i had to take an oral medication twice a day but my GD was very bad. my dr was happy as long as my sugar levels were under 130 2 hours after i ate but every dr is different basically you should watch your carbs so it's not just the sugar you have to watch out for carbs play a mayjor part and you'd be surprised what foods have carbs for example 1 banana counts as 2 serving of carbs and i know i was only alowed 15-17 servings a day so it's hard but definitly worth it for your baby's health i didn't think it was serious till i had my daughter and she had problems and she is my third baby i also had GD with my other two but was able to control it. good luck",
