            "answer": "Do both of you have your results for your thyroid tests? Endocrinologist are now learning that the ranges are wrong for the majority of the population. I was diagnosed with hypothyroid with a TSH of 2.35. Most doctors would have told me I was in range, thankfully my doctor looked at the results and my systems and said that I have hypothyroid. She will diagnosed anyone with symptoms would have a TSH near 2.0 or above. If you want more info I recommend getting a hold of the \"The Thyroid Solution\"--http://www.amazon.com/Thyroid-Solution-Revolutionary-Mind-Body-Program/dp/0345429206In hope this helps,achilles2",

    "question": "Hi therePlease could you try help? I have this wierd thing where I get excessively hungry and sleepy after I eat!! It makes me feel like eating nothing just so I can stay awake and feeling well. I almost cannot operate in daily life. My stomach is continuosly distended like a balloon and I am always always constipated despite having given up lactose (what I thought might be the problem). I often get jittery after eating sugary things, need to relieve my bladder an unnatural number of times a day, but I went for a glucose test having suspected diabetes and nothing appears to be wrong on that front.Other things to mention: I suffer from chronic fatigue. I have had mucousy stools a few times and have a tendancy to loose a lot of weight when I get stressed. My hair falls out. I also get a stabbing pain in my lower right side occassionally...but it is very intermittant perhaps every month or two.I've started going on a gluten-free trial period, but I'm finding that I'm getting far too hungry! Do you think I'm on the right track? Much Appreciated!",
