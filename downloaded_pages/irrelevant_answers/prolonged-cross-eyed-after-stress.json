    "question": "Recently, after a very long day (about 20 hrs.), I began to notice that my vision was similar to that when I am cross-eyed.\u00a0\u00a0After resting sufficiently, I am still having the same problem 2 days later.\u00a0\u00a0The best that I can see in the mirror is that 1 eye is not always moving as quickly as the other, but a lazy eye doesn't seem to be realistically caused by fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise, my eyes do not visually appear to be crossed; but my vision comes off as such.\u00a0\u00a0Is this something that will go away, or should I see an optometrist or physician?\u00a0\u00a0Is there anything I can do to improve without seeing a dr.?If it helps, I have both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and take a whole lot of insulin as well as metformin and actos (also for low HDL).\u00a0\u00a0I also have hasimoto's disease.",
