            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Pain in armpit and chest can be due to peripheral artery disease. Peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes, chemical burns due to any deo or lotions you use, peripheral nerve compression are the other possibilities.It could also be due to acidity, gastric reflux or duodeal ulcer or due to dilated bile duct with involvement of pancreas or a combination of either. Raise head end of bed. Take Omeprazole empty stomach in morning and an antacid gel at bedtime. Refrain from smoking, alcohol, fuzzy drinks, caffeine, and spicy food. See if this helps. You may also need to get your liver and pancreatic function assessed.Please consult your PCP for this. Take care!",
