    "question": "I just found out at 32 weeks I have gestational diabetes, and my doc wants me to avoid sex bc it was making me contract so bad. So I have to be on a diet and no sex. This is literally my own personal hell. I'm so moopy and depressed and wishy washy. One day I'm sad about all of this, one day I'm positive. This is just so hard for me to deal with to bedisaplined with food, and my doc doesn't seem to be doing her job. She tells me at 32 weeks, not 28. About my test results. And then claims she was behind and that's why she didn't tell me. Then I find out today that they were suppossed to give me a prescription for the tester and strips, did she? No she didn't. So now I have to wait. This is ridiculous, I want to change doctors but it feels to late in the game to do that. I'm frustrated though with that and struggling with all these changes. Ug. Thanks for listening.",
