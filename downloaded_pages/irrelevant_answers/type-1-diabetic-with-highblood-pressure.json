            "answer": "My a1c was also high when I got pregnant,(like a 10 point something) and I was in the same boat as you-trying to work on lowering my blood sugars to start a family, and surprise, already pregnant-and my pregnancy was actually really smooth. You'll be getting more monitoring due to your diabetes, like more ultrasounds and doctor visits and non-stress tests, but my daughter was born at 39 weeks and was 6lbs, 7oz. (they kept insisting she'd be huge since diabetics tend to have larger babies)\u00a0\u00a0It is possible, you're working on lowering it now, so of course, keep that up. :) Remember it can take a few weeks for a1c levels to go down.",

            "answer": ":) thank you makes me feel so much better! I've gotten my sugars down to about almost normal now its hard as you know but its worth it and yeah they told me that too that I'd be in there at the drs almost all the time especially after I hit 25 weeks I think he said it will be almost every week if not every other week? I'm just worried but guess its only natural to be. But again thank you! :)",
