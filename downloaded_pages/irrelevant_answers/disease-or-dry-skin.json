            "answer": "HI,HOw are you? Are there other symptoms present? Aside from dry skin due to cold weather, pruritus without the presence of rash can be due to certain medications, underlying conditions\u00a0\u00a0(diabetes mellitus, liver disease, kidney failure, jaundice, thyroid disorders and even blood disorders), parasitic diseases, irritation from soap, detergents, and clothing. The presence of hemorrhoids, anal fissure, or persistent diarrhea may also lead to itching around the anus. If it persists, I would recommend that you have this evaluated by your doctor for proper management. Try to avoid activities that involve sweating and moisturize regularly. Over-the-counter antihistamine medications may also help.Take care and regards.",

    "question": "About 4 months ago I developed a strange itchy feeling all over my body.\u00a0\u00a0It started shortly after a risky encounter.\u00a0\u00a0I woke up in the middle of the night extremely itchy over my entire body.\u00a0\u00a0After about a day the itch went away but seemed to be localized in the scrotum area.\u00a0\u00a0 Its been 4 months and since then the scrotum itch went away after about 3 weeks but ever since that time I get real itchy skin when I engage in physical activity such as running, working out or even just sweating a little.\u00a0\u00a0If I rub lotion on my body the itching seems to go away for the most part.\u00a0\u00a0I'm thinking it could be disease related or just dry skin ( weather started to change ie. got cold).1.) Is it possible to all of a sudden develop an itch over your entire body due to dry skin?orDoes this sound more disease related due to my liver?I have also had an itchy red butt crack, pain in stomach, and blood in stools ( not sure if these have anything to do with it)",
