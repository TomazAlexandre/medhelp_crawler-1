            "answer": "I just called my dr today to ask them to do further testing since my last ob said my thyroid was low. They will just give you thyroid hormones if it comes back low again. It has to be monitored the entire pregnancy for levels and it is very common for women of child bearing age. I have a family history of thyroid problems is why I'm concerned and I'm also showing obvious signs",

    "question": "So my Dr called me today and said my blood work came back normal on everything except my thyroid hormone is low and ordered more detailed testing. Any other moms have this problem and what ended up happening? Could this be something that only happens during pregnancy like gestational diabetes and will go away after baby is born or is this lifelong? I'm so nervous!",
