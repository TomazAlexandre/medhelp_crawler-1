            "answer": "Sometimes questions get completely ignored at this forum, because no one can relate to the symptoms, and I think it frustrates the person asking, so I try to make sure they did read the disclaimer. You won't believe how many do not notice it.Your blood results concerns are quite specific and technical, I can't believe you have not been able to get a straight answer from a dr! And these are endocrinologists and gastroenterologists? It has to be quite frustrating not to be able to find answers that can explain your symptoms, to that, some of us here can relate. When I do a web search, sometimes I used vivisimo.com instead of the most popular one, it gives me more relevant hits, many times.good luck in your quest, and I hope someone here can relate to something in your post.",

            "answer": "Thanks again for your replies. Over the past few years I've been to 5 Dr.s and two are listed as endos but none would comment on my labs I listed earlier, except to say that I should not worry about it. If it weren't for the occassional diabetes insipidous symptoms, I would do like they say and not worry. It could be the labs and symptoms aren't related, this is what I'm hoping because I know both liver and kidney problems can cause those results and symptoms.Your kindness is appreciated.",

    "question": "My question is about my ALT reading on two different blood tests, two years apart. On both of these, my ALT/SGPT was elevated one point above normal. These were those readings: March 2003: \"66\" (range 30-65), Sept 2005: \"46\" (range <45). The ranges were different due to being done at two different labs but both were elevated by one point. I had a Hep C test but was negative. Other abnormals on the more recent test were an elevated Chloride level (\"110\" Range 98-109) and my Sodium was borderline high (\"146\" Range 136-146). I do have Hashimoto's Disease but have found little info on whether this can elevate these labs. I occassionally have diabetes insipidous, urination spells but not on continuous basis. What else should I be looking for here?Thanks much!",
