The retina has a high metabolic rate. As long as it is always only associated with low blood sugar I would work on trying to get rid of the hypoglycemiaJCH MD",

    "question": "I'm a 60-year-old female with insulin-dependent diabetes for 10 years (LADA).\u00a0\u00a0Whenever I get low blood sugar, usually at night, I get a bright spot that varies in size from small to large in my field of vision - the lower the sugar, the bigger the spot.\u00a0\u00a0It is usually a yellow-green glow that goes away as my blood sugar increases with treatment. I don't get blurry vision, as listed in almost all symptom lists, but a bright blind spot.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't had an occular migraine or classical migraine with aura in at least 5 years.\u00a0\u00a0Why do I get this bright blind spot?\u00a0\u00a0Is it serious?This discussion is related to/posts/show/527396.",
