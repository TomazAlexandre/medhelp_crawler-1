    "question": "Over the last few months, we've noticed that my 15 year-old daughter's feet are often dark blue and occasionally her legs are also mottled. Her father has a bicuspid aortic valve which was diagnosed when he was 40. Her 20 year-old brother had a VSD and ASD, both corrected surgically when he was 7 months old, though he suffered neuro complications during the surgery. I have taken her to the doctor who checked pulses in her feet with a doppler when she couldn't palpate them. She thought they were diminished and ordered blood work (which has since shown a mildly elevated red blood cell count), an echo cardiogram and a NIVA, which have not yet been scheduled. I am, of course, very worried about my daughter, though outside of the obvious circulatory problems, she seems quite healthy.My question is this: While pregnant with my daughter, I had a level III ultrasound and -- based on my son's heart defect -- great attention was paid to her heart. No defect was found. Also, she has been asymptomatic for all these years and her blood pressure is normal. How likely is it that she has a serious heart defect that was missed? And what other problems should we be considering?Thank you for any information you can provide.",
