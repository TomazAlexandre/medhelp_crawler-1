            "answer": "Hi KittyfaceI am a Type 1.5 LADA who was originally misdiagnosed as Type 2. Oddly enough I also have antibodies for HepC and cleared the HepC virus probably many years ago. I didn't really connect that to my diabetes as I also have thyroid disease which is an autoimmune disorder and I am aware that if you have one autoimmune disorder it's not uncommon to have another.To answer your questions: As a LADA I personally have little or no insulin resistance, though I have spoken with LADAs who do. I don't know that diabetes predisposes you to contracting common viruses as long as your diabetes is under control. That is the key.As far as quitting insulin by following strict diet and exercise guidelines, it isn't impossible, but it isn't likely. It depends on how long you have been diagnosed. LADA is an autoimmune disease where our beta cells are attacked and we produce less insulin over time. You can get a c-peptide test which will show how much insulin you are producing. LADA's do ok on diet and exercise and possibly oral meds for awhile until they no longer produce sufficient insulin. That happens much more quickly than it does for Type II's, but slower than true Type 1's. We often have spurts of insulin production for a couple years. But once we stop producing enough insulin we will become insulin dependent the same as any Type 1.",

            "answer": "No, it's the opposite, Kittyface. It's believed that if LADAs start insulin early it will help preserve some beta cells for a bit longer. That's why it's frustrating how many of us are misdiagnosed and put on oral meds. That's not to mention that some of us are put on meds specifically designed for insulin resistance when we in fact don't have resistance. I was paying about $200 a month for Actos when I was living out of country!",

I do not fit any of the regular pigeon holes, what did ya ecpect, not being a littel bird). When I was 14 the hospital told me would end up on shots, I told them I was not going to hear another word, and didn't and got better...I got in the Navy, became a gomer (mil-speak for GET OUT, My exam Room!), even got charged with UCMJ violation for not seeking medical care. That case never made it to the captain, I requested my sick bay records for the previous 10 days, showing I had been gomered, over and over.I also have little if any insulin resistance and lack sufficient natural insulin. My system tends to flip flop between the modes, as I call it. I will be liek a true T1 at times and at times have som, not enough and go back and forth, sometimes years between mode changes........wierd.LADA, from what I understand, YES, taking insulin early on does delay becoming 100% insulin dependent. When I started insulin about 30 yrs ago, 1 shot a day, then it was 2 mixed shots (NPH & R), then a couple years ago I had to go MDI and 5 shots a day on a basal-bolus routine, sometimes more.I ahve kinda been there done that, KNOW what its like to be totally like a T1, even though I am labeled as T2.(*&*( GOMER",
