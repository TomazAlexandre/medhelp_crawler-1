            "answer": "Dear Messy,None of us are physicians here, but volunteers and are not qualified to give medical advice. I can give you my personal experience in dealing with type 1 diabetes.I have never seen this question come up before and have not heard that it is harmful, but as I said I am not a doctor. It could be that her doctor has told her that this is not a good thing. It could be that tickling stresses her out and stress can raise blood sugars which is something she needs to avoid.Personally, I am a very ticklish person and it is physicallypainful. This causes a very high stress reaction in me and I don't have diabetes.I would be kind and since tickling is unnecessary, respect her wishs and don't do it.Good Luck,dm",

Respect your girlfriend's wishes and don't do things that can cause her unnecessary stress.",
