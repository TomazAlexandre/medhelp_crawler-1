            "answer": "I was allowed to eat before the test, didn't have a certain time limit to not eat anythin', but avoid anythin' sugary and my doctor said to eat somethin' with a good amount of protein In It. I was scared to fail It, so I only ate scrambled eggs two hours before takin' It and a protein bar. And I passed! Woot! Lol. But I do know you can't eat anythin' and only drink water (from what I was told by my doc) after you drink the stuff. And I recommend Fruit Punch over the Orange drink (If your allowed to pick). I didn't think It tasted all that bad. Tasted like a cheap, sugary Imitation of a Fruit Punch brand.",
