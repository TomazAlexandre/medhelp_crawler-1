The diagnosis is pre-diabetes/metabolic syndrome.Insulin resistance has been determined to be the major cause of my weight issue.\u00a0\u00a0Both type I and type II diabetes are rampant in my family.I've recently undergone a comprehensive blood test, which will give actual insulin levels, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I'll get the results for that when I see my doctor on the 18th.",
