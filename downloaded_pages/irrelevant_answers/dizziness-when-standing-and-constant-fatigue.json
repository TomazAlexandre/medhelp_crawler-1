Meditation helps a lot with anxiety problems if you can focus on something other that which is causing the anxiety.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The first thing to be ruled out is orthostatic or postural hypotension. If this is ruled out, anemia, hypoglycemia, diabetes and hypothyroidism should be looked into. Pinched cervical spinal nerve and high blood pressure should be ruled out. It can also be a vasovagal attack. The complex group of symptoms is mediated by the vagus nerve. This nerve is irritated by prolonged standing, standing up suddenly, stress, pain, hunger, dehydration, intense emotion etc. A tilt table test, holter monitor, echocardiogram etc are done for confirmed diagnosis. Discuss this with your doctor.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I seems to have been recently suffering from combinations of these symptoms:Dizziness/Lightheadedness When Standing (Which is fine when laid down, but the same when sat)Numbness in the left side of my head and face which can sometimes occur on the right, but it is raresometimes a dry mouthPanic feeling when i notice the symptoms startVery tired (all the time, except when I first wake up)Sometimes pressure feeling in the left side of my head (somewhat relieved by wobbling my jaw)Sometimes feel sick (never actually vomit)Sometimes get a quick, sharp pain in my head (left side)ALL of these symptoms seem to go away when I take a bath/shower, do something of interest, or go outside. It seems that when they happen, I get very concerned and panic. Sometimes I can calm myself down, other times i feel as if i am not in control of my emotions and i fail to calm myself down.My grandfather suffered a brain tumor before, and I suppose it could be the worry of that causing the symptoms.Also, I am stressed out emotionally due to issues with regards to friendships/relationships in my life, which leads me to believe that these symptoms could be stress related.I am genuinely concerned about my symptoms. If you think that these symptoms may be because of stress, would you please also include any good methods of managing panic that you may have in your answers?I am male, 119 pounds, 5ft 3 inches tall, 16 years of ageWhat could be the cause of my symptoms?",
