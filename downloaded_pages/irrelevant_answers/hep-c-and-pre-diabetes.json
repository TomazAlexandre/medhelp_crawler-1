My plts and Hemoglobin keep moving down.\u00a0\u00a0My G.I. is concerned more about the plt problem.He is worried that my hemoglobin is to low @ 9.2. But he will treat with procrit if he has to.Plt went to 79 in 2 weeks from 184 he says if we get below 50 tx stops. So we have a problem. My question to you is my plts have actually been down to 68.9 K/uL in Sept and I am not sure he looked at that test.\u00a0\u00a0Do you feel he is over reacting or overly cautious? I know he is concerned and has my best interest at heart. He even called me on his day off which his nurse said she could not believe. He wants me to drop the Riba from 1200 to 600 for 1 to 2 weeks so my plts will come back up. I was very sick with a viral infection about 2.5 weeks ago and Dr feels that is why plts went down and the reduction in Riba should do the trick .I don",

Go to Pegasys.com, click on for \"healthcare professionals\", go to pharmacokenetics, go down to see complete prescibing information, click \"complete product info\", and then on \"Pegasys\"...you can go to \"dosage and administration\" and see the FDA-approved chart for Pegasys.\u00a0\u00a0Go to PegIntron.com and you can find the same info.\u00a0\u00a0You and your doctor should discuss the comfort level with the platlets.\u00a0\u00a0Many of us are letting them ride to 40-50 without getting too alarmed, as long as patients are aware of the risk of bleeding.GI.PA",

I need some input on what to do.Over the last couple of months, my GP has been concerned with my blood sugar count going above 200 during Hep-C tx with\u00a0\u00a0the Pegasys combo. He doesn't want to wait until after I am finished to start further Diabetes testing and treatment, in spite of what advise my GI gave. I am also concerned with the numbers, but feel like I need to be off tx a while to evaluate the glucose tollerance accurately. Can anyone here relate their experience on this subject? I would appreciate any and all info I can get to help me decide what to do. The doctor's office has called me three times since yesterday to set up further testing, and I only have 8 more weeks on tx. Thanks ahead for your response! May God bless you all!Tosser (in TN)",
