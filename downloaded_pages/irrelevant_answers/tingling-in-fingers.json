            "answer": "I had the same problem.\u00a0\u00a0I talked about it with my Chiropractor first and he was able to bring it back into full function after only three therapy sessions.\u00a0\u00a0Mine was caused because I have been spending too much time on the computer and holding my left arm in a position where it was cutting off the nerve to my hand.\u00a0\u00a0Sort of like carpal syndrome that I have had before and the Chiropractor helped that too.When you have a problem that is concerning your nervous system, in my opinion, no one knows more than a Chiropractor and they will tell you if they can't help.\u00a0\u00a0Saves sitting in the ER for hours and hours.",
