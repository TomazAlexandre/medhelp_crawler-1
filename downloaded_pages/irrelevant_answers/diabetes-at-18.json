Your lucky there is now.\"True and a lot of new medical practices have been developed since 1973, thirty five years ago, such as the HgbA1c (A1c) test. Aren't we fortunate to live in a society with a constantly improving medical science?I'm no doctor but Googling the words \"mimic diabetes\" turns up 881,000 hits. I do know, that MODY is one form of diabetes and perhaps what her son has, passed down from his father. But I'm glad that that you mentioned MODY as a possibility which is something her son's doctor should have discussed with her. Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY).
