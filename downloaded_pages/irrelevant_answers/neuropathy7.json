            "answer": "Hi there!I am not sure when mine started while in treatment, but I first thought of taking a shower and all that did in the long run...I run out of HOT water!My doctor prescribed me Tramadol 50mg, 1 per day that was 2006.\u00a0\u00a0I am up to 4 a day...I do 2 in the morning and 2 at night and 2 will last about 10 hours now.\u00a0\u00a0Probably for you 1 and then you up it to maybe 2.\u00a0\u00a0I went on 1 for about 1 year.I went to a neurologist...NO NO NO dont do that.\u00a0\u00a0They don't belive and actually said to my face that I was in drug denial and an addict.\u00a0\u00a0That it was impossible to have the pain I felt after the treatment was over.\u00a0\u00a0He was going to cut me off my Tramadol and insist on Ibpr.\u00a0\u00a0No frigging...he don't know the pain I suffer.A Neuropathic doctor is in the same line as above but they look for other possible reasons for your longstanding pain.\u00a0\u00a0This is where I am...new city, new everything.\u00a0\u00a0So it may take a few to get the right answers...but some doctors are talking MS.\u00a0\u00a0Check out the symtoms and see.But for me my health kinda went down hill after that.\u00a0\u00a0Other problems happened, like low blood pressure...they want me to eat salt.\u00a0\u00a0I also had to have a pacemaker for the low blood and heart rate.But mine is probaly far different than your problems.But I hope I cud help a little.\u00a0\u00a0Memory suck and so does my typing.Debbie",
