            "answer": "I had GD and the specialist monitored my baby's progression on a weekly basis by giving me non stress tests and getting (estimated) measurements of the baby via the ultrasound. I was supposed to have a vaginal birth but baby boy decided to use his cord as a jump rope, lol. I ended up with a c-section which sounded like the best thing ever once the\u00a0\u00a0contractions started going in on me in full force, lol. :)",
