            "answer": "Hi there!TIA by definition does not have any residual effects post 24 hours. If there are residual effects beyond 24 hours the condition is classified as a stroke. Your symptoms could or could not be related to stroke etiology. Other possibilities that could account for symptoms include nutrient/ micronutrient deficiencies, stress, hormonal/ endocrine issues etc. I would suggest considering an initial evaluation by a primary care physician and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "Doing a journal on my diet, weight, and diabetes numbers after my TIA/Stroke. Talking to one of my doctors two days ago, he read a new article that states that the medical comunity has revised their take on TIA's. They now no that there can be a longer recovery period than previously believed (1 to 24 hours), and even permanent damage. I now realize that I am having troubles remembering things I did just the day before (like what I ate for breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Has anyone else experienced this?",
