    "question": "hello all,i am very well aware of the fact that the risk of hiv transmission through oral sex is extremely low, if not nonexistent.however, it has recently come to my attention that hsv-2 increases the chances of hiv transmission, and this is worrying me. i have small undiagnosed bumps on my penis (i have diabetes and this is often the result of yeast infections) and two weeks ago i received oral sex from a male who claimed to be hiv-negative. if it were to be assumed that i have hsv-2, should i be concerned about a real possibility of hiv transmission, or is it still a negligible risk in any case?thank you",
