            "answer": "You don't need \"your doctor\". You need a specialist called an endochrinologist. There are several possible causes of childhood obesity, including a genetic metabolic disorder.In such a case an \"exercise\" program is meaningless.There are several options that you can discuss with such a specialist.",

            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!I can understand your concern. In general childhood obesity is due to eating more and exercising less. I understand that she eats healthy food. However it could still be more than what she needs. Make a list of all she consumes daily with the portions she took for a week. Consult a nutrition specialist to check if the total calories are more than what she needs. Also if she does not exercise enough, you can put her into sports activities that will help her burn calories.I understand that she was tested for diabetes. However a single test is usually not enough. You may need to repeat the test both fasting and two hours after food or maybe take a glucose challenge test.Rarely diseases like Prader-Willi syndrome and Cushing's syndrome is the culprit. You can consult an endocrine specialist for this.In kids another possibility is involvement of kidneys. A kidney function tests should be carried out.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Hi,There are other conditions like Cohen syndrome, LMB, Carpenter syndrome, Ahlstrom where childhood obesity is seen. After consultation with the nutritionist, if you find that there is no issue of excess calories, discuss the possibilities of endocrine abnormalities as well as the above syndromes with your doctor and let him decide which specialist u should go to.Regards",
