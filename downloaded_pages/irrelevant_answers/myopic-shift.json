            "answer": "Actually, I do have pathologic myopia and even have had a CNV in my left eye.\u00a0\u00a0My eyesight has never stopped getting worse since I was 12 years old.\u00a0\u00a0However, since I have had cataracts the change has gotten more rapid, and in the last year it is truly at \"warp speed\".\u00a0\u00a0It is very scary especially since I have pathologic myopia, and I guess I am hoping that this very rapid change that I have had recently is due to the cataracts and not due to the progressive pathologic myopia!\u00a0\u00a0As I said I will see my retinal specialist in less than a month, but I would just like to know if nuclear cataracts can cause that rapid of a change.",

    "question": "I have myopic macular degeneration, and I also have cataracts (nuclear and cortical).\u00a0\u00a0I have heard and read and nuclear cataracts cause a slight myopic shift.\u00a0\u00a0However, in the last 15 months, my myopia has worsened by about 3 diopters!\u00a0\u00a0Could this possibly be from the cataracts, or is it more likely that my eye is getting longer and the retina thinner.Even before having cataracts, my myopia gradually got worse, but within the last couple of years, it has been at warp speed!I will be seeing my retinal specialist in a month, but in the meantime, I would at least like to know if it is possible for a nuclear cataract to cause such a fast change.By the way, when I saw the retinal specialist in October, he was against cataract surgery for now because of the risk of retinal detachment.",
