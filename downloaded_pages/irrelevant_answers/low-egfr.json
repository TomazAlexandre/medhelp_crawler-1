    "question": "Hi there, what agreat place! Glad I found it! I recently went to the doctor after noticing my blood pressure readings were rather high. I am a 43 year old male 5'10\" and 205 pounds. My blood pressure was around the 145 / 92 area. The doctor sent me to the lab to take some blood and urine samples. I followed up and he said my EGFR was 58 and my creatinine level was a bit high. He suggested we treat the underlying blood pressure and I am currently taking that while steadily losing weight. Blood pressure is already improving. At the time he seemed so nonchalant about my results that I was not concerned. But now having read this result on the internet I learned I may very have CKD and my life expectancy has potentially drasticallly been reduced. To add to my concern I since have learned about proteinuria and that a familiar symptom is foamy urine. I have had this for a while and really didnt notice it as being irregular until of course now. I have also heard ckd with proteinura gives even much lower life expectancy. My anxiety has climbed ten fold! The doctor did not mention the presence of proteinura or if I had diabetes but I imagine this is separate from the routine tests they begin with? Does anyone have some insight? I have recieved no word to make any lifestyle changes. I am going back in a few weeks to retest.",
