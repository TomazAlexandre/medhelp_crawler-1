            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Lyrica can cause dry mouth and Mobic can cause gastric reflux. Combined they can cause metallic taste. Certain dentures and artificial tooth or filling of dental cavities too give a metallic taste (however you have been to several dentists who have probably ruled this out). Sjogren\u2019s syndrome and copper or lead toxicity are other possibilities. Post nasal drip as in sinusitis, salivary glands infection, pharyngitis or strep infection too are common causes. Other causes include poor oral hygiene, diabetes, liver problems, vitamin B12 deficiency, and over consumption of fluoride which is commonly present in certain mouthwashes and toothpastes , certain vitamins (Tri-Vi-Flor, Poly-Vi-Flor, Vi-Daylin F) , fluoridated water & sodium fluoride liquid and tablets.I can understand your frustration as you are not able to reach a diagnosis. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.OK here are a few tips for you. Try them. They should help. Have citrus juices, lemonade and foods marinated in vinegar. They help in washing away the metallic taste by producing more saliva. Brush your teeth and your tongue with a tongue cleaner at least twice in a day and surely at bedtime. It will help in lessening the metallic taste. Vit C tablets, over the counter oral mouthwashes will help fight the taste. Increase fibers in the diet. Eat fresh things like apples that are crunchy or rough things like popcorn scrapes the white debris off the tongue.Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "I have experienced off and on weekly for at lest two years a foul/sweet taste and metallic taste.\u00a0\u00a0I had pain when chewing so after xrays, etc. I had a root canal on a back tooth.\u00a0\u00a0The taste continuted so I returned to the dentist who went back into this same tooth and basically did another root canal to see if anything had been left.\u00a0\u00a0The taste did not go away and it was suggested that I might have a lateral crack to another tooth (next to the one the root canal was done on) and\u00a0\u00a0that could not be seen on the xray and the\u00a0\u00a0only way to get rid of the taste was to extract the tooth.\u00a0\u00a0After almost two years I decided to have the tooth extracted and have a bridge made.\u00a0\u00a0For months while all this was being done the dentist insisted the metallic taste was from the temporary bridge.\u00a0\u00a0After everything was finished I still had the bad taste and metallic taste.\u00a0\u00a0He then said it was probably another tooth and it should be extracted.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not going back to him but started researching this taste thing and saw where people with Sjogrens or Sarcoid may experience this.\u00a0\u00a0I have been diagnosed with both (in early 2008).\u00a0\u00a0I mentioned to two different dentist that I had both and neither one said a word about the connection.\u00a0\u00a0I never mentioned this taste to either my rheumatoid arthritis doctor who oversees my (sarcoid and sjogrens) or my pulmonologist (who also sees me for sarcoid).\u00a0\u00a0I will be seeing both doctors in the next two months.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I would just like to know can there be a sweet/foul taste that alternates with this metallic taste. I take prednisone (5mgs), mobic, and lyrica and have for over two years. Could any of these be the cause?\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know if this taste thing could just disappear just like it one day appeared. It's horrible. I eat to cover it up but nothing makes it go away.\u00a0\u00a0I brush constantly, some days I constantly keep hard candy in my mouth.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know if this will get worse?",
