            "answer": "Hi,Have you had a urinalysis done to establish or exclude an infection? Was a urine culture done? At this point, your physician has completely excluded an infection?Waiting for the results of your blood tests for diabetes and other possible conditions prior to the cystoscopy may be an option .Other hormonal examinations such as thyroid function test may be done. If the results of these tests are within normal, then an abdominal CT scan may be done. If all examinations showed unremarkable results then visualizing the urethra and bladder through a cystoscopy will be able to help.I know you are highly anxious about this. You may have a second opinion before deciding for the cystoscopy. This will be able to help you decide and weigh your options.",

            "answer": "Hi. Yes, they do a urinalysis every time I am seen, not sure on the culture though. They may have done that at the first visit. I was on 2 different rounds of antibiotics because my primary doctor thought it might be prostatitis, so I would hope that would have gotten the infection.All my blood tests came back normal. No diabetes. At my recent physical they did separate blood work and my serum protein level was just slightly elevated. They didn't say anything about this though.The urologist said my prostate was just a little bit bigger than what he would expect for my age, and there was a small amount of calcification. He didn't think this was a problem though. I also had a small amount of urine in my bladder which he didn't find abnormal 15 mins after using the restroom.Thanks.",

            "answer": "I know how you feel, I have been urinating in the same way as you for many years. I posted a question tonight in fact. I have been to two urologists and may as well have gone to the vet. One prescribed Omnic C and the other also prescribed same before moving me on to Detrusitol. Both said I suffered from a muscle problem which was not allowing the urine to be released from the bladder. Problem was the above tablets overrelaxed the bladder and I was peeing more frequently. Neither guy could get it right, however, I did meet a gent while on a trip last year and he noticed my problem and said he had suffered the identical problem as me (and now you) and he had been to a Harley Street urologist(there's posh) who prescribed (and this I'm not sure) Pirodene and he was perfect with that. Thing is I didn't write it down and had had a few drinks at the time but I am nearly sure it was Pirodene he said. I am doing my best to find out if anybody else has been diagnosed and prescribed Pirodene or something that sounds like it for this complaint.",

            "answer": "Are you possibly thinking of Pyridium? It's generally for pain from irritation of the urinary tract, but I see where it is also used for urinary frequency, which can also be caused from irritation. I'll have to mention it when I see a new uro and see what they think. The only thing is, it is dosed 3 times/day and I don't think it's supposed to be taken long term. Maybe it could just be taken at night when it's most bothersome to me? Who knows. This may not even be what you're talking about!",

            "answer": "Ok, I read your other post. Pirodene is the brand name for piroxicam in Indonesia. It is an anti-inflammatory so if it's an inflammatory issue, it should help. However, you would think similar drugs like Ibuprofen and naproxen would help. I actually have some piroxicam and may try it. You don't see it all that much anymore as it has a black box warning in the USA.",

    "question": "I'm a 25 y/o male and for the last 6 months or so I have been urinating about once every hour or two. I rarely can get through the night without having to get up at least once, sometimes twice. At first my doctor thought is was prostatitis and I went through 2 rounds of antibiotics. When that didn't help he thought I better see a urologist. I've been seeing a PA at the urologists office. He of course checked my prostate again and did an ultrasound. He thought the residual urine in my bladder 10-15 mins. after urinating was acceptable. He thought my prostate looked just a tad bit larger than he would expect for my age but nothing to really be concerned about at this time. There was also a spot that looked like some calcification from a previous infection. He put me on Detrol LA since it sounded like overactive bladder but if it helped, the extra water I was drinking from the dry mouth offset it. So I tried Sanctura XR which maybe helped a little, but not enough to justify its continued use. I've also be tested for diabetes and of course they've done several urinalyses. So now he wants to do a cystoscope to rule out interstitial cystitis. I just don't know if I can go through with it. The thought of it just terrifies me. If it was really necessary, maybe, but it's just to rule it out. I think they'll have to sedate me or put me under.I don't have any pain, ever. I usually feel like I have emptied my bladder completely after going. I try to watch what I have to drink before bed but if I even have a sip of water it seems like an hour later I have to go, and it's not just a tiny amount or dribbling, although this happens ocassionally.Any ideas?Thanks.",
