            "answer": "If you can control it by diet the most I had to do was prick my finger and test my BSL 4 times a day. Usually you will be refered to a dietician and also a diabetes specialist. If its not controlled by diet then you may have to have insulin shots, these are easy, painless and self administered. Once bub is born GD goes away, yet in saying that if you have diabetes during pregnancy it ups your chance a little of getting diabetes later in life. The possibility of having a bigger baby is true, but once again this will be monitored. Best thing to do either if you have it or you don't is to eat healthy, drink lots of water and exercise.Good luck and don't stress what will be will be, and it's easily treated and monitored!",
