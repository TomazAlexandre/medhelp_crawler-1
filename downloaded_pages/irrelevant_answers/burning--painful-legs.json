            "answer": "Another question is do you suffer from any type of back problems. I suffered from severe burning in one leg and foot for months, it was the result of RSD. I could not let a sheet touch my skin without intense pain. The problem arose as a complication to my back surgery but you may just want to look into it. The only thing that brought the pain to a hault were nerve blocks and a certain medication, all of which you may or may not be a candidate for. This could be totally un-related but it is worth investigating since there are many factors leading to RSD. In any case I hope you feel well soon and your doctors can get to the root of your problem.",

            "answer": "I've been having burning symptoms on legs and feet. I'm 60. Also I experience a lot of itching in my groin area and ear canals. I also get restless legs at night. Has been going on for years. Dr's no help to date. I can hardly stand to wear shoes or my leg brace from polio as a child. The only thing that helps for restless leg and burning is what my doctor gave me for arthritis and that's Vicodin. There seems to be a lot of people out there with similar symptoms.",
