            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Tingling in head and neck, and upper chest can be seen in peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes. It is also seen in peripheral vascular disease. Compression of cervical spinal nerves too can cause it. It can also be due to cold and sinusitis. In all probability it is cervical nerve compression. MRI of cervical spine should be done. Without examining you it is difficult to access the situation.Other causes are cerebrovascular accident or stroke (not in your case), head injury, facial nerve injury and compartment syndrome. Please do not ignore it. Get a neurological consultation. Seek another opinion or discuss this with your neurologist. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
