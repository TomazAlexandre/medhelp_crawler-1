            "answer": "i had the same things happen to me when i was younger. i was around 15 or so and i wasnt eating right cause i wanted to be skinny (i was 260 pounds) anyways i almost quit eating completely i would only eat once a day and it was usually something small in the evenings but several times while standing by the road waiting on the bus i would pass out and have a seizure and when i would get to the hospital my sugar would always be low therefore it would cause me to have a seizure but im now 24 and no longer have those problems but we are now worried that my 3 year old son has diabetes because of high sugar readings and constantly using the bathroom and drinking all the time",

    "question": "I appreciate any and all responses as my family works through these issues and gets some answers to what is happening.\u00a0\u00a0My son is 11.\u00a0\u00a0He has been on medication for moderately severe asthma since he was three. He has led a perfectly normal life on that medication.\u00a0\u00a0Four weeks ago, when he was getting ready for school, I found him face down in the dining room.\u00a0\u00a0At first I thought he was goofing off but when he would not respond, I reached down and touched him.\u00a0\u00a0He has sweaty, clammy, moaning and rigid.\u00a0\u00a0I flipped him over, made certain he was breathing and called 911.\u00a0\u00a0I did what they told me and they were here within five minutes.\u00a0\u00a0He regained consciousness about a minute before they got here, but was still confused.\u00a0\u00a0He became incontinent.\u00a0\u00a0They tested his blood sugar (which I assume was normal because no one said anything) and packaged him up for the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0The ER doc said it was a seizure and we were immediately referred to the children's hospital for a workup with a pediatric neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0So far his CT scan, MRI and sleep deprived EEG has come back normal.\u00a0\u00a0He is scheduled for a 48 hr inpatient EEG as soon as school is out.\u00a0\u00a0About a week after his seizure he came to me complaining that he wasn't feeling well.\u00a0\u00a0His heart was racing, he was cold, clammy and sweaty.\u00a0\u00a0After it happened a second time a couple of days later, I mentioned it to one of his doctors.\u00a0\u00a0They thought it might be cardiovascular and need to be worked up by his allergist/pulmonologist or pediatrician.\u00a0\u00a0When calling to leave a msg for his regular dr., his nurse wanted him to go to urgent care to have an EKG done before the next morning.\u00a0\u00a0His EKG was fine and as an afterthought they ran some blood tests as we were walking out.\u00a0\u00a0Those blood tests came back and his thyroid was low, pituitary high and blood sugar low (49.)\u00a0\u00a0The dr called next day and asked me if they addressed the low blood sugar in urgent care.\u00a0\u00a0Because blood tests were an afterthought they didn't even know about it til the next day.\u00a0\u00a0The dr had me get a blood glucose monitor and we are trying to capture one of these episodes and see how it corresponds to his blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0 Before I knew to check his blood sugar he had another one of these incidences, he got up, I recorded his pulse every 10 minutes until he recovered (about 30) minutes, he went back to sleep and some time in the next few hours he became incontinent again.\u00a0\u00a0Since I got the monitor, he hasn't had a really bad one yet, probably because I am making him snack regularly and being somewhat careful of how I feed him.\u00a0\u00a0He wasn't feeling really well after school tonight so I tested his blood and he was 75.\u00a0\u00a0From what I read, that is not really low.\u00a0\u00a0I know the drs need to do a lot more tests and it will take some time to sort all of this out.\u00a0\u00a0I am trying to be patient and at the same time I am dying to know some more information.My questions is this - is is possible that a kid has diabetes if he only has low blood sugars?\u00a0\u00a0Wouldn't he have some high ones every now and again?\u00a0\u00a0Is the thyroid thing related or just another detour?In a way I am hoping that it is diabetes because then we would have an answer and protocols and support.\u00a0\u00a0The other things they are testing him for and have talked about are more ominous and rare and no one seems to know much about.\u00a0\u00a0Right now he has a ton of restrictions because of the seizure - such as he can't swim.\u00a0\u00a0At least if it was diabetes, he could get back in the water and have a normal summer.\u00a0\u00a0What an awful thing to hope your child has - this is so overwhelming because whatever happened has changed our lives.\u00a0\u00a0I kind of feel that I have the weight of the world on my shoulders.\u00a0\u00a0The neurologist suggested we put him on seizure meds to prevent a future one.\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to do that until the testing is complete.\u00a0\u00a0The asthma dr doesn't think that his asthma meds could have contributed but there has been a reported case of something like this - so I decided to take him off asthma meds and now he is having some asthma symptoms again.\u00a0\u00a0My husband died 7 years ago and I really feel alone in this.\u00a0\u00a0I have always thought of myself as a competent mom and that I could handle most anything, but this is really complex and there are a lot of drs and specialists involved.\u00a0\u00a0I kind of feel like we need a case manager to help me sort through all of this - is it fair to ask his regular doctor to\u00a0\u00a0manage information?Thanks for reading this post and listening to my driveling.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone has any suggestions I am open to almost anything at this point.",
