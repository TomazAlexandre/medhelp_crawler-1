    "question": "I had a question regarding dry mouth.\u00a0\u00a0My\u00a0Mouth not too dry during the day but it wakes me up during the night? It started about two weeks ago and had continued.\u00a0\u00a0Leading up to that time I have not been on any medicine but have been under extreme emotional distress due to HIV scare can anyone comment on this? The stress is worse when I wake up in the morning during the day I use different coping mechanisms to get myself through the day and stay relatively hydrated but it flares up once In a while during day.\u00a0\u00a0It's especially bad at night thoug it wakes me up between 5 and 6 am everyday.\u00a0\u00a0Can I carry that stress and anxiety to sleep with me so much so that dry mouth wakes me up at night? I have been told by HIV forum that I had no risk no exposure. Please comment",
