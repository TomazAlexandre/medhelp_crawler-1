            "answer": "Hi:Lyme disease can cause white matter lesions, forgetfulness and all of the symptoms you are describing.\u00a0\u00a0I have met people who were told they had MS due to lesions for years, only to find out later on it was really lyme.\u00a0\u00a0Once they got treated by an ILADS trained LLMD (Lyme Literate MD) they got well and the lesions went away.The key here is the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I had a terrible time back in Feb-April of 2010 with weird symptoms, dizziness, anxiety, forgetfulness, brian fog, etc, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I had dozens of tests, including a lyme ELISA test...all normal.\u00a0\u00a0I was told it was stress, that I had a somatization disorder, and told to go on Prozac and seek therapy.\u00a0\u00a0I\"m only 35!I then found another doctor who happened to be an LLMD.\u00a0\u00a0SHe did a Western Blot test from a lab called Igenex.\u00a0\u00a0I came back highly positive for lyme and some \"co-infections\" (Bartonella and Babesia.)\u00a0\u00a0I never had a rash nor do I remember a bite.\u00a0\u00a0Lyme is in all 50 states.I'm now in treatment and am 90% better!\u00a0\u00a0 I have a few more months to go.Just a word of caution...lyme is very controversial.\u00a0\u00a0The mainstream doctors and infectious disease guru's deny that Chronic Lyme exists and feel it is easy to diagnose with good tests and easy to treat with 2-3 weeks of antibiotics.\u00a0\u00a0 This just isn't true and there have been no double blinded studies to show that lyme is eradicated from the body with a short course of antibiotics.This is why you need an ILADS trained doctor.\u00a0\u00a0 You can go to their website and download Dr. Burrascano's treatment guideline.\u00a0\u00a0It is the \"bible\" of lyme.Not saying you have lyme...but any time I see \"lesions\" on white matter, I always think lyme.Check out the documentary Under Our Skin (google it).\u00a0\u00a0There are also clips on youtube.\u00a0\u00a0You can probably rent from your local library.You can get well!\u00a0\u00a0lymenet is a good resource also.Cheers",

            "answer": "In follow up to my previous question, I finally obtained a copy of my MRI report as well as the CD with the actual pics of the MRI (like I could really understand what I was looking at).\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, after a lot of blah, blah, blah that I don't understand and that was stated as unremarkable, which is a good thing, these are the things that stood out:HISTORY:\u00a0\u00a056 yr old female w/short term memory loss, personality changes; tonic clonic idiopathic seizures; seizure free since 1989.A focus of increased FLAIR and T2 signal is appreciated in the left perifrontal/periventricular white matter measuring approximately 7.5 millimeters in it's maximum dimension.\u00a0\u00a0Smaller lesions are seen in the anterior aspect of the left corona radiata subcortical white matter of the left frontal lobe.There is subtle mucosal thickening in the frontal, sphenoid, bilateral ethmoid and maxillary sinuses.\u00a0\u00a0Mucous retention cyst is present in the right maxillary sinus measuring at least 1.2 cm.IMPRESSION:Abnormal signal foci in the perventricular/perifrontal white matter, anterior corona radiata and subcortical white matter of the frontal lobe on the left w/out associated mass effect or retractive changes consistent with probable nonspecific demyelination or gliosis.\u00a0\u00a0A contrast enhanced MRI of the brain, however, is recommended for further evaluation.Basically, I have the neurologist from h*ll.\u00a0\u00a0He doesn't answer questions, nor does he explain anything.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing my neurologist stated was \"this white matter is indicative of a history of diabetes, migraines or high blood pressure\" - none of which I have.\u00a0\u00a0So I'm left scratching my head wondering what it is.\u00a0\u00a0My \"exam\" usually lasts 5-10 minutes and is marked \"comprehensive\".\u00a0\u00a0@@\u00a0\u00a0His last words after this \"exam\" were, \"Hey, you take Mysoline, and you have to, so it's just a part of it.\"\u00a0\u00a0UGH!\u00a0\u00a0I'm 56 years old dang it - don't talk to me like I'm a child.\u00a0\u00a0Simply tell me.\u00a0\u00a0Since he brushes off any questions I might have, could someone please explain to me what the above means.\u00a0\u00a0I understand the chronic pansinusitis . . . but I don't understand the other, and I don't think it's helpful to me to google certain words to come up with what it says.Please!\u00a0\u00a0Any help someone could give me would be much appreciated.",

    "question": "I have had epilepsy for over 40 years - been seizure free for 20 of those years.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed over the past couple of years I was becoming more and more forgetful, but chalked it up to getting older (I'm 56).\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, my neuro ordered the MRI to be on the safe side, as well as some blood work.\u00a0\u00a0The MRI came back showing white matter or lesions (can't remember the word he used 'cause\u00a0\u00a0. . . I'M FORGETFUL, dangit!).\u00a0\u00a0He said it was probably due to either high blood pressure, migraines or diabetes (that he had diabetes, and if he had an MRI, there would be alot of these white areas).\u00a0\u00a0Okay . . . I don't have high blood pressure, I don't have migraines and I don't have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He thought it might be due to my B12 which is borderline . . . but I'm back to . . . if I don't have any of the things he listed, what are these white \"areas/lesions/matter\"???Thanks.This discussion is related to/posts/show/293139.",
