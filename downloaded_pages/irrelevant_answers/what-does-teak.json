            "answer": "I've done a lot of reasearch about HIV antibodies, this situation about 3 or 6 months to be conclusive. Teak says it may take very rare up to 6 months for HIV antibodies if you have suppressed immune system, so I did a research of diseases that causes supressed immune system, just like Teak Said: Cancer, Steroids (any drugs), organ or bone transplant, I don't have none of those I thank God! so a 3 month HIV negative test is negative if you have a healthy immune system, he was right from the beginning omg, all my symptoms were due to the Flu not HIV, I had a few complications from the flu, sinus infection, ear infection and stress, anxiety, depression created more symptoms which drove me crazy, omg!!!!\u00a0\u00a0LIFE is complicated, I learned a lesson from this experience.....Taking care of myself,\u00a0\u00a0life is not about sex, its not worth 3 or 6 months worth of pain and suffering.",
