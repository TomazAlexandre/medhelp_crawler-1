            "answer": "So confusing.. I took Adipex 37.5 and it was not oval it was a white football shaped pill w/ blue speckles ... They work then Ive had a generic adipex that was white oval w/ speckles it didnt work as good. Dont think you can get them over the internet anymore .. I just ordered a Diet Pill called Phentramin-D Hope it works not sure will get them in Monday and I will update you. Remember you dont have to diet and exercise not with the real adipex but when you stop taking them you need to eat healthy and exercise or you will gain it all back plus some.. Dont want that to happen...Hope I helped you out...11/13/2009",
