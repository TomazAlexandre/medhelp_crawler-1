Well Creatinine Level 2.9 is more but still you can control with proper Diet. Best chance is to talk to Dietitian and plan her daily food guide. I am sure with strict diet restriction (she can not have certain fruit - vegetables etc ) she can maintain the good creatinine level.",

He was taken to the hospital a wk ago his bloodsugar was 1100 and his creatine came back 10 which is failure he also was in diabectic ketoacidosis.After 3 days his creatine was brought to a 6.7 and his sugars remained in the 700's. I found out yesterday that he checked himself out of the hospital after agreeing to start dialysis the next day with his kidney dr. He loed to our entire family about everything, he told us he was discharged his Dr. informed us of al the above. He was told at home dialysis is not an option for him and he said he will not do. He told me Thursday that his bladder is full but he can only dribble when he urinates of course when I called his dr. he asked me to take him back to the hospital, my brother got mad at me for getting involved and he decided to take off with a friend for the weekend to an area called cedar key we are in jacksonville. his dr. said he is critical and needs to be in the hospital. I cannot get him to answer his cell phone he said he would call yesterday when he arrived. his dr. said if he makes it back that we need to call 911 or take him to the er. I know yesterday when he yelled his sugar was high, I know he is scared and tired of all the yrs of shots,sickness,pills and being blind and now this. He was told 2 yrs ago that he would need to start dialysis and now we are at this point. I do not know what to do, we lost our Mom 3yrs ago from congestive heart failure. My brother and I are so close we are only 14mths apart. I am so afraid that he went away so he could die. What should we do? If we call 911 he can refuse the trip, if we have him backer acted what would that do. He said he is ready to go home but his dr. said with dialysis he could live 2 more yrs or longer. Please any advise would help. I feel like I let him down by letting him leave like this. Thank for any advise",
