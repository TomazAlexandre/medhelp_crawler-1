Her diabetes is also about 225 post meal. My concern is, is it safe to go for the surgery. Dr.said its not going to be laser, they'll do surgery and put a filter to drain out the fluid it will take around 2-3 hrs for operation.She is also having issues eating any food in evening mostly after 6pm and she mostly have constipation. She immediately vomit out anything solid she eat in the evening.Waiting for an early reply.Thanks",
