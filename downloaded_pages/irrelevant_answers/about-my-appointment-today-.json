            "answer": "Your not suppose to eat 8 hours prior to your test. I perform these everyday at my local hospital. It just gives alot more accurate results. But every practice has different rules to follow.As for the spewing during the test - do not think this means you have gestational diabetes. . Alot of women who have GD have no symptoms at all during the test.",

    "question": "so girls i did my glucose test today. it wasn't as bad. i have five minutes to drink it. i drank it and i felt fine. i didn't eat anything for 9 hours so i was surprised. my doctor saw me and said my baby was \"loud in there\" in my stomach? is that a bad thing? she said she kept kicking at the dopplar and moving and was like whoa you got an active baby. anyways so 20 minutes before the hour was up i threw it up! i threw up a lot too. I'm not sure if it was all of it but i threw up and i felt so much better after just a bit dizzy. they took the blood and i got dizzy again! i think its because i didn't eat at all. but that was it. do you guys think i passed? i hope i did.",
