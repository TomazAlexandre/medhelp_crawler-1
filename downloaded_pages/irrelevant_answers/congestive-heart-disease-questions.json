            "answer": "The major symptom of CHF is fatigue, poor exercise tolerance and shortness of breath with normal activity. If you are experiencing any of these you need to get checked out.Remember, CHF is usually the result of anther underlying condition like prolonged high blood pressure, a common virus that settles in the heart muscle, valve disease, heart attack and many more.As far as a treatment goes, the underlying cause is treated first. In some cases the heart can recover, in many it can not and there is no cure short of the ultimate treatment of a transplant. If you are concerned, you need to ask these questions of your doctor.Good luck!Jon",
