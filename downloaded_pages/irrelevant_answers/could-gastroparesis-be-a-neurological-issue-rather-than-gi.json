            "answer": "So, how are you feeling now? I know its frustrating waiting for the specialist's appointment! Has Reglan given you any symptomatic relief? The side effects apart, have you felt relief of symptoms? Gastroparesis is generally idiopathic (the cause is unknown) or secondary to neuropathies acoompanying various conditions like Diabetes mellitus. Even if it is a neurological problem, it presents with gastric symptoms. Hence, a gastoenterologist is the best to allay your problem.",

            "answer": "The Reglan helped the pain but causes nausea, dizziness, and fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0To me, the pain is better than the side effects of the meds.\u00a0\u00a0My blood levels are all great; no sign of diabetes, thyroid conditions, cardiac problems, cholesterol issues, etc.\u00a0\u00a0All cardiac tests came back normal as well.\u00a0\u00a0I've had CT's and MRI's, all with normal results.\u00a0\u00a0My PCP is completely puzzled, especially due to the fact that I typically only show up in his office once a year because of strep throat.\u00a0\u00a0I've seen him three times in the past month, beginning with the originating chest pains (originally believed to be gall bladder but ruled out by the ejection fraction) and most recently after the gastroparesis diagnosis following the emptying study.I quickly looked up borrelia burgdorferi and, if the only way to obtain this is through a tick bite, it would be impossible as I've not been bitten by a tick in years (unless it can remain in my system without any symptoms).\u00a0\u00a0With the vagus nerve being predominate and with the low heart rate, I'm very concerned about this affecting my heart.\u00a0\u00a0Especially since I'm a runner and have a low pulse and blood pressure to begin with.\u00a0\u00a0I run distances and am now concerned about keeling over out in the middle of nowhere.",

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0Generally, I am a very healthy 38 year old woman.\u00a0\u00a0I run, I eat well, I don't smoke, I drink an occasional glass of red wine, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I have been having a significant amount of difficulty getting in to see the GI doctor I saw while in the hospital and have been doing some online research in the meantime, as I continue to have chest pains.\u00a0\u00a0My general physician has prescribed Reglan while I wait for the specialist to return my numerous calls (can you tell I'm getting frustrated) and I really don't like the side effects I'm experiencing.\u00a0\u00a0Because the big question seems to be \"WHY?\" and the information I have obtained on the internet, I have to wonder if it would be in my better interest to see a neurologist in order to possibly rule out any type of nerve impairment as it pertains to the vagus nerve.I spent four days in the hospital due to chest pains.\u00a0\u00a0My heart rate dropped into the 30's and I was placed on the cardiac unit.\u00a0\u00a0A significant number of tests (gall bladder and cardiac related) proved inconclusive for a reason behind the pain.\u00a0\u00a0It was not until 20 minutes prior to my discharge that a GI doctor suggested gastroparesis and scheduled a gastric emptying study.\u00a0\u00a0The study was performed and, after 2 1/2 hours, only 23% of the contents had been emptied.Any an all suggestions would be helpful, as I have been unable to get in to see the GI physician who initiated the study.",
