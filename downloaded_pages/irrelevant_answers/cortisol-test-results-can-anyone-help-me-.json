            "answer": "Hi rumpled -Well, I have been hypo for years.\u00a0\u00a0I am 44 no kids.\u00a0\u00a0I have not been on birth control since I was 27.\u00a0\u00a0 I had a bad waterski wipeout and I developed a bloodclot in my leg so I was taken off Birth Control.\u00a0\u00a0 Unfortunately, thyroid problems run in my family.\u00a0\u00a0My mom has Graves, My sister had Thyroid cancer and had thyroidectomy and my brother is Hyper.\u00a0\u00a0 I was talking to Stella on the thyroid board last week about those issues....Heres the short version...I thought I had my hypo all under control.\u00a0\u00a0Then I began to feel\u00a0\u00a0awful again a couple of years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I gained all the weight back I had lost for no reason and I was feeling so crummy and bitchy.\u00a0\u00a0My periods were sporadic & very painful, I had bad acne on my neck, weight gain, I was depressed, tired, angry, cold, my hair and skin changed for the worse...For the past few years I have been having heart palps,\u00a0\u00a0intermittent blurred vision, dizzy spells and the arches of my feet are killing me and the tops of my feet are hurting in my sleep so bad it will wake me.\u00a0\u00a0My ankles have been swelling up then my entire calfs until I cannot even bend my knees.\u00a0\u00a0For months, I cannot sleep.\u00a0\u00a0I am so tired so I fall asleep early then wake up a couple hours later to spend the rest of the night looking at the clock.\u00a0\u00a0All sorts of things have not been right.So my doc tested me and ordered an ultrasound found I had fibroid tumours and a polyp.\u00a0\u00a0He sent me to a specialist and the Specialist was a complete jerk, he told me I was not 20 anymore, I was perimenopausal and to get over myself.\u00a0\u00a0He said the tumours and polyp were probably caused by excess estrogen but since I was getting older my estrogen levels would drop on their own and I would be fine.\u00a0\u00a0No treatment would be necessary.\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile at the same time my doctor let me switch Thyroid meds, from 200 Eltroxin to 125 Natural dessicated thryoid.\u00a0\u00a0 After another year of feeling crappy I finally just stopped taking my Thyroid meds end of Nov 09.That brings is to now, in Jan 2010 I hired an ND.\u00a0\u00a0It took awhile to get in.\u00a0\u00a0Jan 23rd we did bloodwork and a Cortisol test. I just got results back. ( I am in the middle of a FHST too.)\u00a0\u00a0My exact thyroid info is all over on my other posts in the Thryoid Forum but basically, my TSH was 66.00 and my T3 and my T4 were in the hole too.\u00a0\u00a0By the time I got new meds, my entire body was cramping up so badly I could barely move a muscle or get dressed, I was writhing in pain and on the floor.\u00a0\u00a0Not good at all but I am back on meds and that is improving.\u00a0\u00a0So the other night I get into see my ND and she gives me the other test results that I posted above.Now I have been having issues with my ovaries and cervix for years.\u00a0\u00a0I have had cysts, I have been treated for cervical cancer, I have had a polyp removed and now I have Fibroids and another polyp.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering if PCOS could be my underlying cause of all of this?\u00a0\u00a0I am being treated for one thing at a time but never all of it at once.\u00a0\u00a0Interestingly enough, I became Hypo after being treated for Cervical Cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Now that my insulin is high I can see why I cannot lose this weight.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I see my MD tomorrow morning to get referred to endo about the insulin issue.\u00a0\u00a0 What do you make of this all?\u00a0\u00a0 I am trying to put all the pieces together.\u00a0\u00a0I think diabetes is unlikely.\u00a0\u00a0But looks like I am insulin resistant for sure, which would explain why I am gaining weight and not losing any.\u00a0\u00a0 Would I benefit from Metformin?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your time.\u00a0\u00a0Connie",

            "answer": "The birth control pills would interfere with the saliva cortisol tests - estrogen binds to free cortisol and lowers the result, that would make you look lower than you are.Thyroid problems run in my family too - cancer, Hashimotos, goiters etc. I got the goiters and Hashimoto's - mine is gone too.I have pretty much all the same gyne issues except mine was pre-cancer and I had endometriosis really bad. I finally got a hyst.Usually the PCOS symptoms, diabetes etc. - is high cortisol, not low - it also adds into the thyroid mess. BCP means urine and saliva tests will not be accurate due to cortisol binding globulin being high. You will have to use blood testing.Have you looked at Cushing's at all?",

You sound like me - and I had it - I was cyclical and pretty similar to you. The whole insulin thing can be Cushing's too. I was put on metformin as well.

            "answer": "Ok you've got me thinking about Cushings now.\u00a0\u00a0I really don't think I have diabetes it makes no sense for me to have Diabetes, I have no family history of it at all and my eating habits are really better than average.\u00a0\u00a0There needs to be an underlying cause for my \"Insulin Resistance\".I have been reading about Cushings now and I think I need to be tested.\u00a0\u00a0What if I have a Pituitary Tumor or something?I have been complaining for at least 7yrs years now about my intermittent blurry vision and the fact that my head feels like a Seashell.\u00a0\u00a0This is the best way I can describe it.\u00a0\u00a0Its like my brain is too small for my skull and it is always pounding.\u00a0\u00a0Every morning when I awake, I do not even have to lift my head up off my pillow and I can hear and feel my brain quietly pounding on the inside of my skull.\u00a0\u00a0Like when you put your ear up to a Seashell and you hear the ocean inside it.\u00a0\u00a0This is what my head feels like to me,\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes when I go into a store that is bright I have to cover my ears with my hands just to muffle the sudden pounding in my head because it can get very loud when aggravated it seems.\u00a0\u00a0Of course this does not work but its just my natural instinct to do this.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a dull headache now for about a month kinda above the bridge of my nose and to the slight left of my left eye. I thought this was sinus related but I am not stuffed up.\u00a0\u00a0 I really think I need to have Cushings ruled out/in and get my head checked too.\u00a0\u00a0When the ND first saw me she said my pupils were not dilating with the light and this concerned her too.\u00a0\u00a0I was thinking maybe I had a problem with my dental work and this could be causing this however I have no tooth pain at all.Well, I do not want to be on the merry go round of treating one thing after another and never really solving my problem.If you were me - what tests would you ask for?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your help Rumpled.\u00a0\u00a0C",

In other words - not everyone has every symptom.But we all have or had Cushing's.I went on metformin because they said all my problems were PCOS. It would change my life. It did actually. I spent the time on metformin running, screaming, for any toilet I could find.Cushing's is not one test - it is many. And if you are me, you fail most of them.:) I was cyclical so it took forever to get diagnosed. Urinary free cortisols. Saliva cortisols. Serum cortisols. ACTH, renin, aldosterone, dhea sulfate - and then get thryoids, pituitary and comprehensive hormone panel that they normally do... androgens... you really have to get a good doc.",
