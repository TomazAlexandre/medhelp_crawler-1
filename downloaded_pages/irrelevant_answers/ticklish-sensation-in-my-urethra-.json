            "answer": "Hello,Such type of sensations of the penis can be due to anxiety, contact dermatitis, traumatic damage to the nerves of penis, diabetes, prostatitis, genital herpes, urethritis and STD\u2019s like Gonorrhea and Syphilis but they are less likely in your case.I would suggest you to keep the area clean and wear cotton underwears. Also apply a mild steroid cream on the penis. If the symptoms persist then the above said conditions have to be ruled out. Please consult a urologist in that case.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "I have this ticklish, itchy feeling in my urethra. Kinda burning when I pee. My girlfriend got checked 3 months ago and had sex with one other besides me who made her get checked so she assumes he was clean. She has no symptoms and we became sexually active about a month and a half ago. I started the symptoms about a week ago. The symptoms are on and off and stopped for 2-3 days and came back. I don't think it's herpes. I was thinking urethritis. But that's my only symptoms. I've looked at everything and I've either missed the window to get symptoms like herpes is 2-7 days and we had sex a month and a half ago, 3 weeks ago, and a week and a half or so ago. Maybe two weeks. I need help. This is urgent",
