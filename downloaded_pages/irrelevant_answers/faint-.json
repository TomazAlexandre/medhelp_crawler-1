            "answer": "Hi,Pacemakers will guard against fainting only if the cause of the fainting is a heart problem. If the source is something else, like low blood sugars, it will not prevent fainting.Our bodies get used to different physiological states and what you have developed is called hypoglycemic unawareness--that is, you have been low in the past and your body is now used to it, so those signs of low blood sugar do not happen as much anymore. it is a dangerous state to develop because you can pass out without warning.Metformin and Glipizide should be taken regularly everyday, and are not designed to be taken \"as needed.\" If you take them both and your blood sugar becomes low, then your medication regimen needs to be adjusted. It sounds that way already because you are\u00a0\u00a0having lows even now. I think you should speak with your doctor soon about these lows you are having, and also possibly a diabetes nutritionist/educator who can help balance out some of your meals so that you have less variation during the day.Hope this helps, take care.p.s--please check your blood sugars before driving, and have something to eat if your blood sugar is less than 75mg/dL. If you feel unwell, do not drive.If it happens while driving, pull over immediately.",

            "answer": "Hi,First the conversion: 75mg/dL is equal to 4.1 on your metric scale.You are having quite a few symptoms when your blood sugar actually is not that low. At the very least, you\u00a0\u00a0should not be passing out or nearly passing out when your blood sugar is above 4 on your scale. The dangers of passing out or having seizures usually start with levels below 2.2 on your scale. It may not be the absolute number that is making you feel badly, but perhaps the drop itself(i.e you feel badly because your sugar is dropping too quickly, but not because of where it ends up).Speak to your doctor about trying a different medication that is not as likely to cause hypoglycemic\u00a0\u00a0symptoms as Glipizide. It is a good medication but it is not for everyone.Others to consider include Januvia and metformin.It is best not to have the lows in the first place because eating afterwards will cause you to gain weight--not a pattern you want to have.Call your doc again and ask about other medications, or perhaps some dietary changes(like low carb) that may help. Good luck and take care.Remember to check your sugars before driving.",

    "question": "Recently, I got few episoles of blackout.\u00a0\u00a0One of the forum doctor said, if I got a cardiac pacemaker that I guarantee won't faint.\u00a0\u00a0I wish to know, would the pacemaker also cover for low blood sugar faint as well?When my blood sugar falls to 3.2, I only feel like having a gastric pain, no shaking, no dizzy.\u00a0\u00a0Last year when my blood sugar fell to 4, I had a bad cold sweat, floppy and shaked.\u00a0\u00a0How come it changed the symptoms or feeling?\u00a0\u00a0How do I update the symptoms of low blood sugar from time to time?Is MiniDiab (Glipizide) an insulin?\u00a0\u00a0Should I take it regulary or only when my blood sugar too high?\u00a0\u00a0I took Metformin if I didn't have my meal.\u00a0\u00a0I took MiniDiab when I have my meal.\u00a0\u00a0Is that the correct way?\u00a0\u00a0I am afraid too floppy and unable to function if I take the MiniDiab regulary.\u00a0\u00a0Metformin is not working for me.\u00a0\u00a0Don't ask me why I take it, should ask my doctor why she wants me to take that?Thanks for taking my questions.",
