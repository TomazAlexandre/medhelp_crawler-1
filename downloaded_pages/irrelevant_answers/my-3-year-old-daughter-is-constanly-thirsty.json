            "answer": "This is a difficult question to answer. Yes, excessive thrist can be a symptom of Diabetes. However, it doesn't neccessarily have to be.\u00a0\u00a0There are many other reasons for being thirsty. As far as going to the toilet goes that could be a uti (urinary tract infection) or it could simply be because she is drinking so much it would be natural to urnitate a lot. As far as I recall, a rash would probaly not be a symptom of Diabetes. Given that, I would go to her Pediatrician and tell him/her about the symptoms and ask to have blood work done to test her for Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Its a simple blood test and you will get a diagnosis confirming your worries or that she does not have Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I know you are worried, however, it is probaly not Diabetes. If it is, the good news is that is a highly treatable disease and she can live a very healthy life (given that she manages it well) for many years, even a\u00a0\u00a0normal life expectency.",

    "question": "My name is Laura and i have a 3 year old daughter who is constanlt thirsty. She will have a drink one after the other and if she cant get a drink she will get very upset and start crying. This has been going on for about four months now and her constant need for a drink is slightly concerning me. She always needs the toilet. She is asking to go every ten minutes or so. I have just put her on the toilet and within minutes she has asked to go again.She also comes out in a rash every month or so, its lumpy and she complains its very itchy.Is this something i should worry about?",
