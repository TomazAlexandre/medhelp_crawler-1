            "answer": "I am going to play devils advocate here. I am sure you are doing your very best. But could be getting just a bit too protective? And provoking a negative response in the process.The only way you will get your young adult children to take responsibility for themselves is if you stop rescuing them. They are hiding behind a veneer of imaturity. And they will continue to do so as long as you desparately try and protect them from the consequences of their poor judgement.I have no doubt that you your protective stance is well intentioned. The irony is that it does not do the intended beneficiaries (your children) any favours. The sooner you let them stand on their own two feet, the sooner they will come to terms with their diabtes and deal with the challenges involved.Cheers,Mark",

            "answer": "It's soo tough to watch our kids steer toward self-destruction.Alcohol binging and abuse is dangerous even without diabetes, and with it, it can be much worse.It's not inevitable, but it's common that DMers who've been constrained by well-intentioned rules, docs, fear, parents, etc. will eventually break out of their \"shackles\" and attempt to experience life on their own terms.\u00a0\u00a0It's a normal part of maturing to distance ourselves from our parents, to find our own voices, etc.\u00a0\u00a0\"Kids\" with DM also understand that the most effective way to get a rise out of their parents is to manipulate them thru DM denial.\u00a0\u00a0The goal, of course, if for DMers to **internalize** the rules and not continue to respond with adolescent habits.Two folks writing in this thread give painful, common examples of how it plays out.\u00a0\u00a0I'm convinced (thru my own experiences, not a medical degree of any kind) that most often, the \"issue\" these kids are battling is NOT diabetes, per se.\u00a0\u00a0It's depression grown out of less-that-adequate skills to cope effectively with a chronic illness and I would recommend pursuing options that focus on the emotional & psychological aspects of it, rather than the physical stuff.To the person whose 21 year old daughter will not take meds or test herself, I wonder if she is developmentally disabled or if your family has enabled her to create this unfortunate situation.\u00a0\u00a0Since your vacation is not yet \"here,\" how 'bout preparing for the vacation by NOT stepping in at all between now &\u00a0\u00a0then?\u00a0\u00a0By age, she is an adult.

            "answer": "Dear anniem47 and par2323,My heart goes out to both of you. This problem is too common with kids, teens and young adults with type 1. I am not a physician and cannot give you medical advice, but like the volunteers and people posting comments we do have alot of life experience in many different situations dealing with our own children with type 1 or from personal experience from type 1's themselves. I can only try to add to the wonderful postings already here.I was in the same position as you are both in when my son was younger. His case was more of a matter of denial and not taking care of his diabetes. He was also dealing with depression. It did take a complication to make him realize that he is not immortal and that nothing could happen to him. This is what many teens and young adults go through. It is also a denial of dealing with any chronic disease. No one at that age wants to be considered different from their peers. Who can blame them, but as we know the dangers of one drinking incident with type 1 can have terrible results. Not to mention a refusal to take personal responsibility to manage their diabetes without us as parents constantly on top of them. Markie is correct that at some point we have to back off. As a Mom this was the hardest thing that I ever did, but I have come to believe that it is not all or nothing. The research that I have found is that up to 75% of anyone dealing with a chronic disease will experience some form of depression, especially with type 1. We were able to get our young adult son help with a wonderful doctor who he was able to talk to about his diabetes and his personal feelings about it. It made a difference to him to connect with a person other than parents, relatives and friends. In his case he was put on an anti-depressant that did help. This is not always neccesary, but in his case it was a great help. Lee07 has hit the mark on this one.Although both of you are coping with children that are young adults, I would recommend trying to get them into therapy with a qualified therapist who specialise's in depression. Hopefully their endos can recommend someone. I know that this is easier said than done, but it is worth a try.Par, I truly hope that you can get your daughter into a therapist who deals with type 1 and depression. They may then have resources with a diabetes educator who can help her with managing her own diabetes. It is obvious that she needs to get to have help accepting her diabetes first.There are young adults out there that with age came wisdom. I encourage everyone not to give up hope and know that you are not alone.anniem47 and par2323, The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation has a sister outreach program that matches you to a volunteer that have gone through the same issues. This is a one on one communication called the Online Diabetes Support Team. Go to http://www.jdrf.org/ and click on the right side of the page. Someone will be in contact with you if you like. Please keep looking for further comments.I wish you both the very best,dm",

            "answer": "Lee07 has knocked the nail on the head here. Depression is a really\u00a0\u00a0difficult problem to deal with in DM teens. It is common with young diabetics. And the hardest part is to recognise it. Our 18 year old daughter, who was diagnosed with T1 in November last year, became very depressed. But we didn't realise it until after the second suicide attempt.Fortunately, Caroline has recovered remarkably and continues to make great progress. I now recall her asking me before the crisis if it was possible to kill someone with insulin. But at the time, Caroline appeared to be cheerful and in control of her life. Then, out of the blue, she injected herself with about 500 units of Novolog. And I only just got to her in time. She was taken to hospital and put on an IV glucose drip. And it took three days to get her blood sugar to stabilise.In retrospect, we should have listened more carefully to what Caroline was telling us. There were warning signs that we missed. We may have been able to get her to go for counselling and avoided the crisis altogether. But, on the other hand, Caroline doesn't tolerate interference in her life. And she probably would not have responded favourably to such a suggestion anyway.Having said all that, I still believe that the best way to empower your children to take responsibility for themselves is to take a step backwards and put them in control. Just be sensitive to what may be going on with them. And be ready to pick up the pieces if there is a problem.Cheers,Mark",

It sounds like his Endo is on top of this, as you are. What has impressed me is that you both have the lines of communication open and he is willing to talk. I can't tell you how important this is. I hear from so many young adults that refuse to talk to their parents for whatever reasons. I hope you will continue to post comments for others at this site and if you ever have concerns, please feel free to contact us. Excuse me if I am amused at your reference that he is a trooper.

            "answer": "To the Team SSIf you read my post, you know that my son was also only 3 years old when diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0He is now a healthy 21 year old, who is trying to be a little bit too undiabetic right now.\u00a0\u00a0However, when I had a sit down with him the other day over my concerns, many were alleviated.\u00a0\u00a0Though Danny is far from perfect in his control, it has never gone over 9 for his A1c, ever.\u00a0\u00a0Before college, up until I'd say his senior year in highschool, it had never gone much over 7.\u00a0\u00a0His endo told me that he is doing well for a college aged child.\u00a0\u00a0When he was in 3rd grade he started doing his own injections just like that, it was unbelievable.\u00a0\u00a0Since he grew up with the disease I think it is really 2nd nature for him to simply whip out his meter and test, along with drawing up his shot.\u00a0\u00a0Though I don't like him giving his shots through his clothes, it is a battle I let him win and up till now have never had any problems with it. This has been going on since highschool, when he didn't want to be dropping his pants to do a leg or butt injection.\u00a0\u00a0The ONLY time he developed an infeciton at a site was from the pump, and it could have been quite serious, but we (including him) really kept on it, including some antibiotics.I know I complained about him the other night, but since talking to him I realize what a great little trooper I have.\u00a0\u00a0Like I said, far from perfect, but I know I don't have to worry about him checking himself or doing his shots.\u00a0\u00a0I know he should be keeping a record book, and be more careful about what he eats but so much of this is his age and lifestyle right now.\u00a0\u00a0At least when he does eat, he covers it with insulin even if it means more than 4 injections a day.As far as 'par' was talking about with her daughter, I think there must be some depression going on there.\u00a0\u00a0Just the fact that she mentioned she is going to die is quite an announcement of where her state of mind is. She should indeed be doing her own shots and checking at nearly age 21.\u00a0\u00a0If she is rebelling then she needs to speak to a professional to help get her through this. Danny never stopped checking, doing shots, counting carbs, checking his urine when ill, etc.\u00a0\u00a0These are things that should be a normal routine for her now.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if the answer is going on vacation, I'd be afraid of leaving her alone with just her negative state of mind.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not trying to scare you 'par' but I would at least have someone stay with her; i.e. a family member? I hope you have spoken to her endo about her neglect and feelings?As far as Markie's remarks on how perhaps I'm pestering him too much, I really don't think that is the case at all.\u00a0\u00a0I rarely mention it anymore unless it's a little reminder here and there.\u00a0\u00a0Danny really is what I'd consider completely on his own taking care of it.\u00a0\u00a0That is why my concern rose, from observing from the sidelines.\u00a0\u00a0I'd actually forgotten that we made the agreement that we would talk every 2 weeks about his diabetes if I wanted to.\u00a0\u00a0Once I brought it up to him, he was quite willing to discuss it.One time not too long ago, I said something to Danny regarding something he was either eating or drinking, it may have been a beer.\u00a0\u00a0My husband was quick to let me know that I shouldn't be getting on Danny, that he is 21 now.\u00a0\u00a0Danny replied that it was ok to his dad, that he knows that I just worry about him and he expects that.\u00a0\u00a0It was incredibly sweet and mature.Annie",

She suggested to me that maybe I had never gone through a grieving process because I was so young when I got it. She says that happens w/ early diagnosis Type 1's sometimes. Another thing she has helped me with is the issue of codependency in family systems with a chronic illness such as diabetes. Although most people associate (who are even aware what it is) codependency with addictions, it can also manifest itself in families with a chronically ill person to a greater or lesser degree.",

Codependency as I understand it (NOT A DOC or THERAPIST) can make folks do things that aren't really welcome or even supportive but actually aggravate the situation. Ask yourself, \"How would I feel if someone were doing this to me?\" And be honest. Codependency occurs because the person feels lost, alone, maybe betrayed, like they do all the work and no one else does any, etc., like they have the weight of the world upon their shoulders. It's excrutiatingly painful and no wonder, right? And everyone seems to manifest it in one way or another at some point in their lives. There's a really, really, good book out there by Melody(sp?) Beattie called -Codependent No More. A lot of folks who live with emotionally trying situations have gotten help from her.

There's some interesting stuff about Borderline Personality Disorder (definitely not a doc or therapist or even a psychologist, just have my own experiences w/this) having to do with rage. It blew my mind that someone said that. It almost sounded like a threat, frankly. And manipulative. Not that all BP's are like that. And if she is, you might think about checking w/Dialectical Behavior Therapy, created by Marsha Linehan.

Nope...all I was doing was abusing myself. That goes for someone who is ill and not taking care of him/herself as well. How do you help someone and be supportive of their wellness and better decisions without 'enabling' them to further self-destruct? By letting them live their lives and make their own decisions...I think, anyway. Easier said than done. But very, very freeing. The trick seems to be where to draw the line. I know that if I was 21 and someone was refusing to let me draw my own insulin (and forgive the bluntness of this) but I would be mad as heck and want to fight. However, maybe this person is disabled in some way. Has she ever gotten the chance? And camp is not always fun, you know. I had some heinous experiences at diabetic camp. The iron fist approach does not work. Letting go will not only save someone else, but you as well. It will feel completely foreign and unnatural if you struggle with control, but it will pay off in the end. And I am not calling anyone codendent or anything else...Also, a practical tip for those who are adults and drink w/diabetes. If you have to drink, at least eat some bread and drink plenty of water. It helps. But I wouldn't recommend it. I paid a heavy price, myself. What's the official suggestion by the ADA?",

            "answer": "This is all so very interesting for me. I have never checked my newly diagnosed son. I wouldn't even know how to give him a shot of insulin nor check his blood sugar level! He is 20 years old. I know I would not be welcome in his room ever at all. Is there something I am doing wrong here? It sounds like I am being neglectful, but since my son is a young adult, I feel that he has to take responsibility for his actions. He eats whatever he likes, drinks alcohol and I try to stay out of it all, because if I don't I find that I get too upset with him and our relationship suffers. Perhaps I should learn to check his sugars, and give him his insulin.",

    "question": "My son, who has had diabetes nearly 18 years, & has been in college for a full 3 years doesn't seem to take the drinking thing seriously.\u00a0\u00a0Though he has gotten sick at least 3x to my knowledge from it, still I see him taking much liberty with alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0Even when I'm out with him, such as tonight, he drank one corona and a mixed drink (long island iced tea of all things!)\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what to do.\u00a0\u00a0I hardly see him check, though I do see him whip out his kit to do his insulin.\u00a0\u00a0He is Humilin and Lantus.\u00a0\u00a0The other night at his brothers wedding, for which I cut him lots of slack, he drank so much that instead of staying at a hotel with his counsins & friends that night (for which they were supposed to be up checking him) he ended up coming home instead with no argument.\u00a0\u00a0All night long I was up checking him every 2 hrs.\u00a0\u00a0He went from 39 to 400, and back again.\u00a0\u00a0I'm very upset with his lack of seriousness on his diabetes in general.\u00a0\u00a0He keeps no rec. books, doesn't check his avg on machine, and most times doesn't check to see before he eats.\u00a0\u00a0He covers the amount of carb he thinks he is eating, disregarding whether he may be low or high before doing so. I spent my life teaching him to do things right.\u00a0\u00a0I must have read most books on the subject when he was diagnosed at a baby age.\u00a0\u00a0Now I feel I have failed, that all my work and dedication to helping him lead a healthy adult life was useless.\u00a0\u00a0What do I do before it is too late? He believes my small use of alcohol is the reason I am so \"overly\" concerned, which is certainly not the case.\u00a0\u00a0Worried sick in Chicago. AA",
