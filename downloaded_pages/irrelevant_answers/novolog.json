            "answer": "One thing to make sure of is that your insulin is not more than a month old. The effectiveness of insulin can go down after a month. We've run across that a few times.Another thing to keep in mind is that sometimes your body will adapt to insulins/regimine. My husband has changed his insulin dosages several times over the 24 yrs of being diabetic. He also switched from short acting to 1 long acting shot. His body is reacting better to this than it was to the Novolin.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Once your blood sugar reaches past the 180 you body dose create a greater resistance to insulin usage. Plus what ever you eat can react differently in your body. For instance my body has a harder time useing insulin when ever I eat pizza. Its like all the carbs and sugar in the pizza have a longer effect on me. As you saw you body did react a little to the insulin. Not a big effect but a little. I have a huge resistance to insulin even though I have juvenil diabetes. I have a adult diabetes resitance so I have to take special meds to help the insulin get used in my body. Hope this helped.",

            "answer": "The comments posted above are good. If this was a one-time problem or is a recent problem, I really would consider using a new bottle of insulin. It is recommended that you open a new bottle every month whether you use it up or not. Insulin can go bad.You don't say if you use a pump or shots. If you use a pump, you may need to replace your set.",
