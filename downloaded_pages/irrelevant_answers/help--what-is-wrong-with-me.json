            "answer": "You didn't give much to go on here.Your doctor may no be an idiot and knows what he is doing, after all, he is the one with the many years of expensive education. Plus,\u00a0\u00a0if he tested you for thyroid and levels are normal, then there is not a thyroid issue.\u00a0\u00a0Thyroid symptoms are so nonspecific with many other health conditions having many of the same symptoms as thyroid, that thyroid diagnose is not based on symptoms alone.If you see an endo., get copies of your thyroid blood test so that you know for sure if you do or don't have thyroid condition.\u00a0\u00a0TSH, FT-4 and FT-3.Then this time, whatever the endo. says, you must believe. Perhaps the endo will work with you in finding out what is causing you issues.Good luck",

            "answer": "Dear Fieryspirit,Your age may have something to do with it. I had no health problems until I hit 41 and then WHAM! Perimenopause and Hypothyroidism within one year. Both have similar symptoms ...I disagree just a bit with Graveslady - even if your TSH comes back normal, ask to be re-tested a few times over the next two months - and check with your Gynecologist if you are nearing 40 to see if you are Perimenopausal! Doctors and labs do make mistakes and sometimes it would help if they would just think outside the box - we are not all the same so what might be normal for one may not be normal for someone else.I contacted both of my doctors (Internist and Gynecologist) in a six month period with the same symptoms you descirbed and was told my TSH was \"normal\". Then, I ended up in a medical trial which included multiple blood tests every three weeks - including the TSH. The third time I went (nine weeks into this eight-month study), my TSH came back a little off. They decided it was a fluke. Three weeks later - it was way out and they contacted my doctor who started me on Levoxyl. Three weeks later, he doubled it ... etc. This has been going on for ten years and has grown very old! The good part is I found this site so maybe can find more clues and help!Take care!",

    "question": "Hi there, I am really starting to feel as if there is something seriously wrong with me. For the past four weeks I suffer from insomnia, something I've never had problems with before. I am lucky if I get 2 to 3 hours sleep a night, even when I go to bet later, I still wake up at 1 to 1h30. I also have terrible nightsweats so that I have to jump in the shower at least twice during the night. Sometimes I have extreme nausea but not always, it seems to come and go. What is bothering me the most is the brain fog I have recently, it's as if I cant think. I can't retain normal conversations anymore because I cannot focus long enough to complete what I was saying. I also picked up a lot of weight around my midsection, this really bothers me because I've been slim all my life. Even though I eat healthy ad exercise I cannot seem to lose the weight.My sex drive has completely dissapeared, in fact I don't know what a libido is anymore. I also suffer from joint pain and muscle pain more and more as well as abdominal tenderness.. I had nephritus as a child and ever since I tend to get kidney infections about once a year. I don't know if any of this could have anything to do with it. Also, there is a history of diabetes in my family, both my grandparents on my mom's side suffered from diabetes, I don't know if this is relevant. I went to see my doctor and he just told me that my symptoms are a result of\u00a0\u00a0stress. I started in a new position about four months ago in the same company, where I know all the people and the work, in fact there is a lot less stress in my current position that before. He seem to think that this is the cause of whatever is wrong with me. When I asked him to test me for thyroid, diabetes and hormonal imbalance he just shrugged it of and said there is no need, that my symptoms will dissapear soon. Well It's been three month's and it is steadily getting worse. I want to make an appointment with an edocrinologist, will that be the right person to see? I cannot carry on like this, it is affecting my whole life. Please HELP!......Thank you",
