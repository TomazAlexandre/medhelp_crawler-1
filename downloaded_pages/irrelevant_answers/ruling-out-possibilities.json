            "answer": "Dear Dianne:Sorry that your having problems.\u00a0\u00a0The usual things we think about causing symptoms of paresthesias can be vitamin B12 deficiency, diabetes, alcoholism, refsum, collagen vascular diseases, genetic diseases (which are pretty rare and likely you don't have these), etc.\u00a0\u00a0Most of these can be detected by some simple lab tests such as vitamin B12 level, CBC, ANA, sedimentation rate, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Some of these can be ruled out by history (i.e. symptoms eating certain types of food, family history, diabetes, social history).\u00a0\u00a0Assuming that your neurological exam is perfectly normal, then any one of these enities would be in their preliminary stages and might not be diagnosed by lab results only.\u00a0\u00a0Some diseases take alittle time before they become evident and only give \"soft signs\" early on.\u00a0\u00a0Some tyes of peripheral neuropathies can be detected by EMG but usually one waits for more signs of peripheral abnormalities.\u00a0\u00a0Evoked potentials can detect some demyelinating and neuronal loss diseases and is a possible test to consider.\u00a0\u00a0I would think that the best way to approach this is to get some of the basic labs as mentioned as see what would be next.\u00a0\u00a0In your favor is the completely normal MRI/MRA of the brain.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

            "answer": "If you are tested for B-12, a good idea, get the number results and unit of measure. Do not accept \"It's normal\" as an answer.If the level is under 350, methylmalonic acid and homocysteine should be tested. These usually expose a false normal.Make sure the doctor know that a large percentage of those with neurologic damage from B-12 deficiency are NOT anemic. They can become badly disabled and near death before developing the blood disorder.Also,",

    "question": "I am a 27 year old female, and I have been having strange neurological symptoms for nearly 3 years.\u00a0\u00a0I get left-sided numbness, which often begins in my face then spreads to my arm and sometimes my leg.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes this is accompanied by a headache, but not always.\u00a0\u00a0The longest this has lasted is 4 days.\u00a0\u00a0The last \"attack\" I had was accompanied by dizziness and fatigue also.\u00a0\u00a0I should also add that lately I have had joint pain, specifically my left hip and right shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if it is related but I am getting that looked into.I have seen a few neurologists, who have said complicated migraines.\u00a0\u00a0I recently started seeing a \"headache-specialist\" neuro., who thinks this may be atypical migraine but wants other things to be ruled out first.\u00a0\u00a0So he is recommending I see a general neurologist to rule out blood clotting diseases, connective tissue diseases..... I am wondering if you have any recommendations on what other things should be looked into?\u00a0\u00a0So far I have had an MRI and MRA, which have both been fine.\u00a0\u00a0No other testing has been done.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you- these attacks are very scary (I always think \"stroke\") and I am anxious to find an explanation once and for all!",
