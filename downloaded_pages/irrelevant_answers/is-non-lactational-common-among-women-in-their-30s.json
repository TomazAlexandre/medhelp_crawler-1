            "answer": "Dear LI Girl, Some situations that we see non-lactational mastitis occur are in women with a history of diabetes, or in women with a depressed immune system (they are more prone to infections).\u00a0\u00a0Infections do not lead to breast cancer.\u00a0\u00a0However, some breast cancers lead to infections, or can look like infections as cancer cells grow, noncancer cells die off for lack of blood supply, and the dead tissue can get infected.\u00a0\u00a0So it's possible, though extremely unusual, for a breast cancer to show up as a breast abscess.\u00a0\u00a0There is a type of breast cancer called inflammatory breast cancer that can be mistaken for infection.\u00a0\u00a0It starts with skin redness, warmth, and swelling.\u00a0\u00a0What distinguishes it from infection is that it doesn't get better with antibiotics.",

    "question": "I had a non-lactational mastitis in March (I was 31).\u00a0\u00a0It cleared after months (long story).\u00a0\u00a0I am still tender but chalking that up to fibrocystic changes.I have two questions: 1) What would cause a non-lactational mastitis?\u00a0\u00a02) Is this a pre-cursor to anything scary (obviously I am concerned about cancer)?This was a weird thing that I had, it seemed like no one else had ever had it unless they were breast feeding.It has been an emotional rollercoaster, thanks for your time in answering the questions.",
