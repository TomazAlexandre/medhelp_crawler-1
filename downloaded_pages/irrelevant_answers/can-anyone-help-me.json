            "answer": "You just eat healthier.. everyone gets hungry.. you can just have a cup of water before meals so you're full. Also I know I don't want to be one of the woman who eat and eat all day long and gain 60-70 pounds during a pregnancy.. I don't want to get fat. And that always helps me keep my eating under control..and I also know I'm not eating for two. You actually only need an extra 350 calories that's a yogurt and an apple.. so that's all the baby needs to grow and be healthy. And I don't want gestational diabetes.. all these things help me keep my mouth shut lol",
