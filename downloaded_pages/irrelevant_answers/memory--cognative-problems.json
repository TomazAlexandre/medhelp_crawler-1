    "question": "I am experiencing various problems mostly with\u00a0\u00a0memory.\u00a0\u00a0I am 49 and was diagnosed a year ago with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My A1C was 6.5. I was very tired. I could fall asleep at the drop of a hat. All I had to do is sit down and start to relax. My brain was not working so well either. My memory was becoming almost a thing of the past. I was having what I call random access bad sectors. It would strike randomly and I never knew if I would recover what I just forgot. I also did not always know I was experiencing a random bad sector. Then I was diagnosed with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I was going to school at the time and the first indication was, I went from getting A\u2019s and B\u2019s to getting C\u2019s and D\u2019s.\u00a0\u00a0Very disconcerting for a 3.56 gpa career.\u00a0\u00a0I had not changed how I study.\u00a0\u00a0I thought I had burn out. By January 2007 I was also rather confused at times.\u00a0\u00a0People would speak and I would hear bla, bla, bla, bla.\u00a0\u00a0I would talk and forget what I was saying, even what the subject was.\u00a0\u00a0People would call and I would forget they called and I would forget the contents of conversations. Somewhere in there I also experience weakness on my left side for about 2 months.As my blood sugar regulated this all got better for the most part. I was still experiencing random bad sectors. Though now they were not quite so bad nor quite so often.\u00a0\u00a0Within a few months of starting NPH the random bad sectors calmed down to be what some would call senior moments though I am 49 and mine are worse than my 79 yr old mothers. By this time I was not falling asleep so easily anymore either and my A1C\u2019s were down to 5.6.My memory has never fully recovered. The Doc says that it is not diabetes related. In fact all the docs I have talked to insist it is not and that it is nothing to worry about. I disagree. It does seem to be somewhat related to blood sugars and I think it is something to worry about. This all happened very fast, I was seemingly Ok in September 06 and by Dec 06 I was not. I had always thought it was high blood sugar related however last week I had two days of real bad random bad sectors and my blood sugars were low 81 -130, I was not sick. But man I was dingy and I knew it. I was afraid to drive.\u00a0\u00a0I was confused, had trouble finding words, sometimes understanding, it seemed at times I was looking and moving through a fog. A dimness? Early the first day my legs were a little wobbly.\u00a0\u00a0I was dingy and I knew it.Now I am back to, hmm, more normal, though I am still having trouble finding words at times, it is random when it strikes.\u00a0\u00a0And my memory is messed up.\u00a0\u00a0I can\u2019t always remember what I know I know.\u00a0\u00a0I call all this random short circuiting.\u00a0\u00a0Since the episode last week this is occurring frequently during the day.What could be the cause of all of this?",
