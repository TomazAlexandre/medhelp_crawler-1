            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Big toe numbness can be due to gout, insect bite causing swelling, nerve injury, peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes and hypothyroidism, peripheral vascular disease, and due to gout and arthritis. If there are fang like bite marks, it will be wise to get that investigated. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "If there are fang marks, my vote is for snake bite.I have a neighbor who collects them and has an amazing variety of the critters, all non-nativem which could acount for one escaping and wandering around an upscale building.I have a theory about snakes. The only good snake is a dead snake.I could be wrong, of course. Everything that moves is a creature of the life-force.Still...Call up your local zoo and ask to speak to the snake expert, who will be happy to talk to you. You might have him look at it. I doubt the average ER would have the expertise to evaluate the situation.If you have any secondary symptoms, I would go immediately to an emergency room.",

    "question": "My right big toe has been numb for more than a week maybe two weeks. And I have just noticed what seems to be small fang type bite marks on the top of my right foot just above the big toe. Is it possible for this apparent bite to be the cause of the numbness? What should I do?",
