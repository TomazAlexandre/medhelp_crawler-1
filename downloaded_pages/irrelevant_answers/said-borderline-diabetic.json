            "answer": "Hello MindFlush,Yes, we're all \"not physicians\" here :-)The links and suggestions that were posted for LadyBug's question \"sugar levels\" can be helpful for you.\u00a0\u00a0The American Diabetes Association has many resources for Type 2s and those materials may help you stay \"borderline\" or return to normal blood sugar levels and not become a Type 2.It seems that folks who are borderline diabetics are already experiencing some stressors on their ability to produce enough insulin at the right times and/or their ability to use the insulin they do produce.The \"mantra\" of balancing a good diet with moderate exercise can be both boring ... and also overwhelming ... to consider.\u00a0\u00a0For all us diabetics, however, those are key ingredients to healthy & full lives.As a borderline diabetic, you still have an opportunity to delay or prevent full diabetes by essentially following the diabetic's guidelines (see that ADA website and/or the Gretchen Becker book for newly diagnosed Type 2 posted in response to LadyBug's msg.Good luck and I hope you'll learn lots and take great care of yourself.\u00a0\u00a0You deserve to feel well and to BE well :-)",

            "answer": "Dear mindflush,I am also not a physician but a volunteer and can only give you information on what I have learned over the years. In regards to your family's diabetes, is it type 1 or 2? What was your blood sugar reading at the lab's? The reason I ask this, we now know you can have either. However, at 19, it could suggest the possibility that you could be in the type one stage of\u00a0\u00a0diabetes and experiencing a honeymoon period in which your pancreas is in the early stage and can produce a little bit of insulin. I would recommend that you go to an endocrinologist fora further diagnoses. Not to get too personal, do you have a weight problem. The best information that I can give you is to get a correct and accurate diagnoses. Type one and two have alot of the same dietary needs, blood sugar testing and activities to keep your body in shape. However the two will be different in medical treatment. Please keep in touch either way. Your question is very important to us and I would like to know how you are doing.Best of Luck,dm",

            "answer": "Hi- mind flush09- I am not a physician, but a mom of a child with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Did they tell you if you were borderline Type 1 or Type 2. The two types are totally different. In type one the body stops producing insulin and a person needs to either take shots or have an insulin pump to get the insulin needed to live. Type 2 diabetes, the body produces insulin, but cannot use it properly with out medications, usually oral medication.\u00a0\u00a0Type two can usually be controlled very well with diet and excersize sometimes if enough weight is loss a good diet is followed and an exercise plan, the need for medication can be eliminated.I would check with your doctor as to which type you might be and the best course of action to help you maintain healthy lifestyle.Please feel free to come back and visit.",
