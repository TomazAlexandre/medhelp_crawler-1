            "answer": "Hi there!Dry eyes and mouth are unlikely to be related to liver disease, though these could be causes due to dehydration, side effect of a few medications, micronutrient deficiencies, autoimmune conditions etc. I would suggest getting this evaluated by a primary care physician initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "Nowadays, I rarely drink.\u00a0\u00a0when I do, I have 1-3 glasses of wine and they affect me.\u00a0\u00a0I get dry mouth and urinate frequently at night.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have diabetes according to my labs (A1C and BG).\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, I have dry, red allergy eyes.\u00a0\u00a0I believe the eye issue is caused by my allergies, although I have read about Sojrens syndrome (I am male, and have no other symptoms aside from dry eyes and mouth).I was wondering if an of this rings a bell for the med help community or its doctors?I am hoping that dry mouth and nighttime urination after wine aren't red flags for liver disease.\u00a0\u00a0I have no other symptoms but I am concerned.Seeing an MD in two weeks, and would love any reassurances or insights between now and then.",
