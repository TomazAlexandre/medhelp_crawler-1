B12. vitamins, Thyroid and Diabetes.Then if all them come back normal, it may be neuropathy, a form of nerve disorder.Also hows the spine could be trapped nerve somewhere,But i used to get very hot shins, when i was hyperthyroidism, it was a very good sign to me that my thyroid was working like a bat out of hell.I would definately go see the GP for some bloods done , you may have a simple deficiency, whats causing this sensation in the shin.Good luckNicola",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!A hot patch is usually due to clots in deep veins or deep vein thrombosis. This is usually diagnosed by vascular dopplar studies, CT angiogram or by simple angiogram. The other possibility is an eczema or a dermatitis.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please consult your PCP and get proper referrals for diagnosis and treatment. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
