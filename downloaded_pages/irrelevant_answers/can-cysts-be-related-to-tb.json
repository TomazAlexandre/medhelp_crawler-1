            "answer": "If your son is young enough and healthy enough to undergo the treatment to eradicate the TB in his system - encourage him to go for it!\u00a0\u00a0If not, he will carry the TB in his system for the REST of his life.\u00a0\u00a0At anytime if his immune system becomes seriously compromised, if he gets repeated viral/bacterial infections, pneumonia, diabetes, HIV, etc. etc. etc.....he will be especially vulnerable.\u00a0\u00a0At ANYTIME he could develop active TB and present a risk to those closest to him.\u00a0\u00a0It is also very expensive to treat.\u00a0\u00a0At this time, his treatment would like be covered by the Peace Corps.Trust me, wondering every time you are \"symptomatic\" is a really stressful way to live.\u00a0\u00a0Everytime your son gets a bronchial infection or any upper respiratory illness with night sweats and a cough that won't quit you will all wonder.",

            "answer": "I would think an attempt should be made to biopsy the cysts, to see if the pathogen can be diagnosed. Has a dermatologist looked at them? Has he had a complete physical, with CBC blood tests, chest x-ray, etc? Infectious disease doctor consult would be good.It would seem to be a bit of a leap to presume a positive skin test showing exposure to TB, to be the source of the cysts. Once put on the multiple antibiotic TB treatment, he may develop side effects that confound the true diagnosis.I would think a high rated teaching hospital could diagnose what it is.

General in Boston and NY Presbyterian Hospital are high ranked in your region.",

    "question": "My son has been in the Peace Corps in Ukraine for the past two years. In October, his face swelled up with what was thought to possibly be a spider bite. The Peace Corps doctor treated it by cutting into it to let the area drain, giving IV antibiotics and shots. He developed staph infection, and was seriously ill. Upon his arrival home, he had 2 more cysts under his arm and into his chest. He felt these started similar to the previous cyst on his face. He has recently developed two more cysts, one near his nipple and the other near the incision under his arm. He has also tested positive for TB exposure. Prior to testing positive, he had lost weight. Is it possible that these cysts could be related to the TB? We live in upstate New York, and there isn't much knowledge about TB. Where do you suggest to go for medical treatment, and what are your thoughts? The Peace Corps doctors gave him an option of taking an eight-month antibiotic drug treatment plan. Thanks!",
