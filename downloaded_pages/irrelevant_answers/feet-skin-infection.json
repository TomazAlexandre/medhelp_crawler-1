            "answer": "Hello,This sensation that you are having is called Paresthesia. Chronic paresthesia indicates a problem with the functioning of neurons.Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol?Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder.A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule out the various neurological and autoimmune conditions.Treatment will depend on the diagnosis.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.Warm regards.",
