            "answer": "I am not a Dr. but it sounds like the pain in the legs may be Neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0In bad cases it can be so painful that you can't sleep because the sheets on the bed weigh enough to cause enough pain to keep you awake.\u00a0\u00a0There are special \" pain killers\" for this but they are actually drugs that block the nerves signal to the brain that you are in pain.\u00a0\u00a0Definately need to see a Dr when you can afford it.\u00a0\u00a0As for you sugars running in the 500s that is DEFINATELY bad.\u00a0\u00a0I would be interested to know what Insulins you have tried because that should bring it down and I cant see why it wouldn't.\u00a0\u00a0Change of body temp at night could be caused by the high glucose levels.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like you have several different things going on here at the same time.",

    "question": "I recently moved and I dont have a doctor, I do however have Diabetes Mellitus. I have tried every pill in the book and all the insulin and nothing is working for me. It starts to for a month or so then I am back to square one. My sugar normally runs around the five hundreds. I am 23 and i work two jobs and I suffer from chronic leg pain as well. It could happen when i am sitting, resting, standing, walking, sleeping, anytime. It used to be just my feet would get that burning painful sensation. Now its my legs and a few spots on my spine. It hurts so much i cant walk, or bend down, and especially cant sleep. There is also something that looks like a heat rash. They are covered in red bumps. My body temperature changes drastically throughout the night as well.\u00a0\u00a0My legs swell and it is difficult to walk. It feels like my skin has tightened and the muscles inside are expanding and trying to break the skin to get out. I suffer from nightly muscle spasm and sometimes i cant get out of bed. Im not sure if this leg pain is an effect of my uncontrolled diabetes or is there something else that i have. I can't afford a doctors visit yet, but am working on it. I was hoping maybe someone had some advice. I try looking up my symptoms on the internet but end up getting really confused, because it could be anything. oh yeah, and pain medications dont work with me either. they just make me sick and yes i eat something with them.. they just dont work.",
