    "question": "Ok so I had a physical done almost 3 months ago now and my glucose level came back at 88 fasting for 10 hours which mean I'm not diabetic but I found out my vitamin d level was at 19 which I started taking vitamin d3 pills once a day and I've been having soo much pain everywhere I also found out my tsh level was at 0.58 so I should be getting more test done but I'm hungry all the time, I pee frequently, my legs have been hurting, my heart has been beating really fast after eating, I don't understand all this started happening after my physical I've also been have anxiety and depression and muscle and joint pain, tingly sensation on my hand and feet. Thinning of the skin. And bruising very easily I don't know if I'm diabetic or pre diabetic the doctor told me everything was ok should I get my glucose checked again ? I feel like that's way to fast to become diabetic. I had really bad anxiety attacks that left me in the ER like 3 times and they would always say I'm fine but people with thyroid problems get anxiety idk I've been stressing like there's no other my blood pressure has been going up and down I hate going to the doctor and I feel like I'm always on this site just venting.",
