            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I think you have deep vein thrombosis of the deep veins of the leg or maybe valvular dysfunction of the deep veins of the legs. This could be causing venous pooling that is making the legs feel fatigued and heavy. The venous pooling could also be making the fragile spider veins burst causing easy bruising. This could be especially true as this was an unaccustomed exercise. This can be diagnosed by color Doppler or by angiogram of the leg veins or by duplex ultrasound.High blood pressure, kidney dysfunction, diabetes and hypothyroidism should be ruled out. Birth control pill is another cause of bruising (in females). At times adrenal gland insufficiency results in bruising and chronic fatigue syndrome and this possibility should also be explored. It could also be due to pressure urticaria (possible with unaccustomed exercise).\u00a0\u00a0Possibility of the bruise being rashes due to contact dermatitis too should be explored as you probably went to a camp.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I have done no exercise for two years. Yesterday and the day beforei started an intense boot camp-jump rope, running, squats, steps.\u00a0\u00a0Needless to say I am sore--especially my thighs.\u00a0\u00a0My calves are not particulary sore but I now find my right leg has a string of greenish bruises from the ankle bone, along the inner calf to the back of the knee.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas what this might be from?",
