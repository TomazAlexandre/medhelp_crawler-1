            "answer": "I'm not from your area but I'm sure there has to be something? Have you tried even googling for something? I am now 20 but it was around that age where I stopped testing a lot, theirs realistically not a lot someone can do about it she personally needs to start doing it herself. Is she involved with any physical activity? That pretty much saves me day to day... I had only tested once about 30 times in a 3 month span, my A1c was 6.9, they told me I was luckly to be so active. If she isn't going to test at least try and make sure she knows how many carbs shes taking in and is bolusing (btw is she on a pump?). If her family can afford it or has insurance, a pump makes overall A1C's of any diabetic drop. Also in the summer I use to go to camp joslin, although I didn't test much at home Joslin has VERY good ethics and she will be under perfect control, I would definetly have her family look into it. Hope this helps!",
