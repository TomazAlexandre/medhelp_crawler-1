            "answer": "Hello!Measure you height and weight and calculate your BMI.Depending on the position of your present BMI you have to target yourself.I would suggest you to avoid fast foods, junk foods, fried foods and desserts such as sweets, chocolates and ice creams.Start different forms of cardio such as running, jogging, skipping, swimming, cycling etc to get back into shape. Start with 20 minutes and increase the intensity and time depending on your BMI.Take care!",
