            "answer": "Is your grandmother on treatment for the hepc?If so, with what and for how long, so farWhat Genotype is she?Does she phave Fibrosis or Cirrhosis?If she is not on treatment, then you need to let her know that there are meds available to cure her.With you, from what I have read here after 3 weeks or a month, a viral load test can confirm whether or not you have hepc.\u00a0\u00a0of Course, the hepc Antibody test is a lot less expensive, but only shows whether or not you have been exposed.\u00a0\u00a0If it comes back positive, you still won't know if you have the disease or was exposed and your body fought it off.Conservatively, the really best way to go, is to wait 6 months and have the viral load test, and, while you are at it, a genotype test, so, IF you were exposed, your body will have had a chance to fight the disase off, and if you DO happen to have it, your Dr will already know which Genotype to treat.This is a very slow developing disease, so you have plenty of time, AND, there are several good treatments available.Good Luck.\u00a0\u00a0Let us hear from you. And, welcome to the Forum.\u00a0\u00a0There are lots of of wxperienced, knowledgeable people here.\u00a0\u00a0Pat",
