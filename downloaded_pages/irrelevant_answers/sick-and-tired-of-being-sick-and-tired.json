    "question": "blah!!!!! i went to the doctor this morning. i hate going to the doctors anymore. i really really do. it's sad because aren't we supposed to look forward to that? well i don't!i received that wonderful gestational diabetes diagnosis a week or so ago and am taking insulin shots every morning,checking my blood 4 times a day,\u00a0\u00a0eating 6 times a day, drinking 3 quarts of water a day, sodium restricting, laying on my left side and propping my feet. it doesn't feel like i have time for anything else and if i do do anything else it will cause yet another issue.sorry to rant, but my god, does it ever get better?!today i was told that i am spilling ketones( even though i drink a ton and my blood sugars have been under control) another insulin shot was added to my regimen before bed and i am losing weight. i have until Friday the 24th to get it all under control or i am going to be admitted into the hospital. oh and i somehow managed to get dehydrated, which is causing me to contract.on a good note, the girls are doing excellent, big, feisty and all. they move what feels like 20 of the 24 hours in a day and we get their weights again on the 28th( i'm kinda scared of that appointment)so the girls are doing well, but my body is failing? does anyone have gestational diabetes pointers for me? i already am following the 2200 calorie diet and eating on the schedule.feel free to use as an open forum, i just needed to get that off my chest.",
