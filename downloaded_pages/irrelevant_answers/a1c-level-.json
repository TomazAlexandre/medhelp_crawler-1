            "answer": "Hi,an a1c of 5.7 is an average blood sugar of about 125.\u00a0\u00a0Consider that persons without diabetes will have an average blood sugar of around 86 (A1c of about 4.6).\u00a0\u00a0You are already about 50% higher than that number - so this is definitely your warning to do something concrete.I disagree that prediabetes is not yet diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It is like being a little bit pregnant - you either are or your aren't.It is known that if you are at 5.7 it is likely that you will progress to higher numbers and 'overt diabetes' if you do nothing.But it is early diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You have a golden opportunity now to get excellent control and potentially to reverse this with lifestyle measures.At 5.7 your Dr may already put you on meds.\u00a0\u00a0Usually metformin (an insulin sensitizer) is a starting med.\u00a0\u00a0It often helps with weight loss.The non-drug approach (which is critical) is exercise (particularly high intensity short duration has been shown to help reverse insulin resistance - look up Peak 8).\u00a0\u00a0But just brisk walking is good if this is what you can do.Low carb!\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is a disorder in carbohydrate metabolism.\u00a0\u00a0It makes sense then that you should avoid most carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Stick with non-starchy vegetables to make up the bulk of your carbs (and then quality protein,and non-processed naturally occurring fats: avocado, cheese, fatty meats, eggs, etc).",

Like Bernstein, Noakes, among others who insist that normalizing blood sugar (truly normalizing) is the way to go.We also must not forget that they now think that 50% or more of the US population has diabetes, prediabetes, or undiagnosed diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0These people's \"normal' results will skew what people and laboratories think and say are normal.However, if they get young people who are slim and physically active.\u00a0\u00a0their numbers tell a different story about what is truly normal.",
