            "answer": "I am a t2 diabetic with sleep apnea. I have been using a cpap machine for almost a month. I have noticed within the past week that my morning glucose levels have gone down. There might be some connection between the two conditions. Previously, I had blamed my elevated morning sugars on snacking too much too late(am retired and watch late, late tv). The cpap machine has encouraged to turn in earlier, thereby avoiding the noshing. I sometimes still have trouble falling asleep but when I do sleep I don't toss around or snore. Internet sites suggest there's still a lot of study to do before a definite link is established between diabetes and sleep apnea. Regardless, I am happy with the cpap.",

            "answer": "Many Type II Diabetics have undiagnosed sleep apnea. When\u00a0\u00a0the sleep apnea is diagnosed and treated effectively (often with a CPAP machine to force air into the lungs while sleeping so that breathing is not interrupted), the patient's glucose levels will improve considerably. I was diagnosed with sleep apnea six years ago but was not keeping the CPAP mask on all night as it felt a little claustrophobic. I began to feel a little nauseous whenever I ate sweets, though I never ate them much. My blood sugar levels tested fine at the doctor's office. Once I read about the study showing a relationship between sleep apnea and blood sugar levels, I began to wear the mask all night long and I had fewer problems with nausea when eating sweets. Recently, I have had trouble keeping the mask on at night due to needing to replace it as the seal is not staying sealed. I just ate a small dessert and feel very nauseous now, which is why I'm looking at the diabetes thread again.",

            "answer": "One-Third of Diabetics Have Sleep ApneaMONDAY, July 30 (HealthDay News) -- People with type 2 diabetes who drag themselves through the day may be among the 36 percent of diabetics suffering from obstructive sleep apnea, according to new research.Sleep apnea occurs when impaired breathing due to collapsed airways triggers multiple nighttime awakenings.Researchers at The Whittier Institute for Diabetes in La Jolla, Calif., analyzed health data from 279 adults with type 2 diabetes. They found that one out of three diabetics also suffered from obstructive sleep apnea. Men, particularly those over the age of 62, were more than twice as likely as women to experience interrupted sleep.Previous research has indicated a relationship between obstructive sleep apnea, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, so the connection with type 2 diabetes is not surprising. This is the first study to analyze data from both men and women at a diabetes clinic, the researchers said.\"These findings demonstrate that obstructive sleep apnea has a high prevalence in adults with type 2 diabetes,\" principal investigator Dr. Daniel Einhorn said in a prepared statement. \"Given that treatment of obstructive sleep apnea has the potential to both decrease blood pressure and improve glycemic [blood sugar] control, individuals with type 2 diabetes should be regularly screened for the presence of sleep apnea,\" he said.The researchers published their findings in the current issue of Endocrine Practice.According to previous research, treating people who have both obstructive sleep apnea and type 2 diabetes with \"continuous positive airway pressure\" therapy not only helps manage the sleep interruptions but also reduces blood sugar levels.The researchers recommend that clinicians screen patients with type 2 diabetes for obstructive sleep apnea.According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 20 million people in the United States have diabetes, with more than one in five adults over the age of 60 suffering from the disease. Type 2 is the most common form of diabetes, a disease in which the body does not make or use insulin effectively.The National Sleep Foundationestimates that more than 18 million people suffer from obstructive sleep apnea, although the majority of people have not been diagnosed with the disorder. Obstructive sleep apnea is related to a multitude of health risks, including heart disease, high blood pressure, depression, sexual dysfunction and an increased risk of car accidents.",

            "answer": "I intend to make an appt with my Dr. soon as I have Type 2 and HBP among other things. My husband has suggested several times that I had Sleep Apnea tho we knew nothing of its relationship with Diabetes and HBP until recently.\u00a0\u00a0He did talk to someone recently diagnosed with Apnea and his description seems to fit my symptoms to a T.I know that i am not sleeping at night for any legnth of time. Have never had Apnea suggested but thought the lack of sleep due to Fibromyalgia which it has been suggested that Ihave. Is the aching perhaps instead due to the Apnea or diabetes\u00a0\u00a0and not Fibro?",
