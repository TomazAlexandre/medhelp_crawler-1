            "answer": "Here's the tricky thing with ultra high protein meals...protein is insulinogenic.\u00a0\u00a0When your body receives lots of protein, it promotes the secretion of insulin.\u00a0\u00a0It's odd how this has not become common knowledge.\u00a0\u00a0Everybody points the finger to sugar and carbs as insulinogenic foods, but protein flies under the radar.\u00a0\u00a0If you google \"rank list of insulinogenic foods\" you will see that protein rich foods are high on the list, next to the carbo and sugary stuff.\u00a0\u00a0You will also note that fatty foods are very low (not very insulinogenic, as one would expect it to be).So why is this fact important? Well, because when your body shoots a slug of insulin into your blood after you eat lots of protein, it drives your blood sugar low.\u00a0\u00a0People who drink high concentration whey protein shakes (that are low in sugar and carbs) they hit a wall, because the insulinogenic effect of the high protein promotes the injection of insulin, which then dramatically reduces the few grams of glucose you have circulating in your blood, and then you feel weak, cold, shivery, etc.\u00a0\u00a0This is why a properly made protein shake has a bit of glucose in it, to help protect against this problem.Now, what happens when your blood sugar goes low after you eat ultra high protein? Your body is forced to manufacture glucose from the protein you just ate, and this process is called \"gluconeogenesis\".\u00a0\u00a0For people who eat high protein and at the same time avoid eating sugary and carby foods, the process of gluconeogenesis cancels the low carb eating results and makes glucose anyway...seems a bit crazy as it defeats your low carb eating efforts. By the way, gluconeogenesis is also an energy intensive process, and this makes your body feel sluggish and fatigued.So, how do we avoid insulinogenic effect of high protein, and how to not promote gluconeogenesis?\u00a0\u00a0The best diet for this is LCHF.\u00a0\u00a0This means low carb, moderate protein and high fat.\u00a0\u00a0We should be eating between 0.5 to 1 gram protein per pound of lean body mass.\u00a0\u00a0A less active person closer to 0.5 and more active person closer to 1.\u00a0\u00a0In other words, if a person weighs 150 pounds, and if they are an active person, they should eat about 150 grams protein per day.\u00a0\u00a0If they eat a lot more than 150 grams, they risk going into gluconeogenesis.\u00a0\u00a0This is what we mean by eat \"moderate levels of protein\".So, eating low carb is a very good thing to do.\u00a0\u00a0This will protect you from obesity, cardiovascular problems, diabetes, inflammation...the list is long of all the metabolic problems high carb eating causes.\u00a0\u00a0Just make sure that the low carb is matched with moderate protein and high fat (with fat from natural sources, like olive oil, avocados, butter, coconut, nuts, etc, and not from fake sources like margarine).Fat is a VERY important component to the low carb diet.\u00a0\u00a0This protects your blood sugars from cycling and keeps them steady.\u00a0\u00a0It also trains your body into using fat for metabolism, as opposed to only from carb and proteins.\u00a0\u00a0I know lots of people who have been brainwashed that they cannot eat fat, and they end up eating ultra high protein.\u00a0\u00a0But, their blood sugar is a huge problem, going high and low, and they hit the wall during parts of the day where they need to drink tons of coffee to stay awake and they get raging hunger.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, I used to be brainwashed about the fat phobia too.\u00a0\u00a0When I took the leap and tested LCHF way of eating, I was remarkably impressed with the results.\u00a0\u00a0It was truly a revaluation for me.\u00a0\u00a0I wish this info was more available.Otto, you mentioned eating high protein with complex carbs like whole wheat bread...I caution you on this.\u00a0\u00a0This is highly insulinogenic.\u00a0\u00a0It will drive your blood sugar low, as the carbs in the wheat bread are trapped by the fiber.\u00a0\u00a0First your body will be forced into gluconeogenesis, and then you will feel fatigued.\u00a0\u00a0Then the glucose from the bread eventually gets released into the blood, which again will induce another bolus of glucose into the blood followed by insulin injection again, and your blood sugar will plummet again, making you feel weak.\u00a0\u00a0Try this instead:\u00a0\u00a0each meal eat non starch veg with meat/fish/eggs and fat, and forget the grains.\u00a0\u00a0For example, one meal would be broccoli saut\u00e9ed in butter with steak.\u00a0\u00a0Another example meal is eggs omelette with bacon, asparagus and mushrooms.\u00a0\u00a0Another example meal is a salad with lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, celery, avocado and olive oil with chicken (brown meat with skin on, to get lots of fat).\u00a0\u00a0Think VEGETABLE\u00a0\u00a0 + PROTEIN + FAT for each meal.\u00a0\u00a0Try this for a week and see what results you get. And don't be afraid of using salt. This eating plan was a miracle for me, and now I feel great, with excellent blood pressure, and other on point health markers.",
