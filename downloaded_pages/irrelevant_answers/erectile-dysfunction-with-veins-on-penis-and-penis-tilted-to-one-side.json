            "answer": "Hi, since a urologist has examined you, its unlikely to be Peyronie's disease. This causes abnormal, fibrous lumps (plaques) to form inside the erectile tissue of the penis. This can cause an erect penis to curve or bend. It could be due to medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, spinal cord injury, nerve damage, or neurologic disorders. Discuss these options with your doctor when you happen to meet him next time. Regards.",

            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to Peyronie\u2019s disease or Mondor\u2019s disease. Mondor\u2019s disease is superficial thrombophlebitis of the penis. This is an inflammatory reaction to a clot within the vein. This subsequently causes blockages and dilation of the vein. It is typically painless, but can be painful. In studies, patients were noted to have thrombophlebitis after a prolonged sexual act with or without intercourse. It was described as cord-like thickening of the superficial penile veins.Diagnosis can be confirmed by ultrasound.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
