It is not that bad the only thing that ***** is that I personally have PCOS so bad that I don't get my periods at all.\u00a0\u00a0But don't worry you can get pregnant and sustain a pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I had IVF 2 years ago to concieve my DS who is now 16 months old .. Ijust did my second FET on 12/3.\u00a0\u00a0I take metformin for my PCOS which helps me loose weight and with the cysts on my ovaries.\u00a0\u00a0YOu should definitely go to your OBGYN and if they diagnose you with PCOS you should go see an RE to help you concieve.\u00a0\u00a0There are some women who get put on metformin and their periods return .. That does not happen for me bc I have a severe case.\u00a0\u00a0There are also women who ovulate on their own when put on metformin and who concieve on their own with the help of clomid too.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck to you ..Its not that scary",
