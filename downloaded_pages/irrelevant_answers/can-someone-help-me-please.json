            "answer": "funny you should mention this today. just yesterday i had a 4 year old boy go many many times in a short time period. in his case, i think he was afraid of the automatic flush. he would just let a few drops go and get the heck out of there.personally, i wouldn't take him to a clinic tonight unless he was showing signs of discomfort or any other symptoms. check for a fever just to make sure. i would rather have my child's regular doctor handle it. watch how much he's drinking, and also how frequently he's going at home. i have had many kids get obsessed with having a water fountain in the classroom. they drink tons and end up having to pee a lot too.",

            "answer": "Well, they had him pee in a cup and said everything looked normal, no bacteria or anything. Thank goodness. They did say his pee looked a little diluted but I didn't think he was drinking any more than normal. He has probably 6 or 7 small cups of milk, juice or water in a day. I counted how many times he peed since 1pm. From 1pm-4pm -5 times, then when he got home from preschool he peed another 4 times in the 2 hours before I took him in, then he peed twice at the hospital. I'm not sure how many times he went this morning because I wasn't keeping track. This does seem a little excessive to me.The doctor said it could be behavioral. What's that supposed to mean?Any ideas why he might be going so often all of a sudden?",

            "answer": "each time he goes to the bathroom can you aproximate how much, I am just thinking perhaps he is not completly emptying his bladder, when you took him to the clinic did they do blood work, a normal routine check up usually consists of a CBC, and a BMP, a BMP will be for glucose, and electrolytes, if htey did blood work I would call and ask what his glucose level,w as.",

            "answer": "They didn't do blood work because it was an Acute Care Clinic. They just had him pee in a cup. They said everything looked normal, no bacteria, etc. I asked how his blood sugar was and they said they didn't test his blood but it looked fine in the urine.I've been watching him lately when he goes to the bathroom and he's peeing a fair amount. I just don't know why he's peeing so much, enough that his preschool teacher became concerned. Could it be just a sensitive bladder or something?",

            "answer": "Sometimes I am on the Berkley Parents Network forums and there were a lot of posts regarding frequent urination in preschoolers. The majority of comments mentioned it can be a behavioral thing at that age that will pass. Some kids are getting so aware of their bladder filling up that they think they need to go. Others go but don`t empty their bladder completely, so they go many more times. My son is the opposite, he holds it in forever since age 6. Maybe it is a final stage of toilet training... Regardless, if you can, I would of course get his blood sugar tested next time but the situation seems to be more common than we think. Maybe not to worry.",

I wonder why it seemed so unusual to his preschool teacher, then.And of course, I should get all of us tested from time to time since I have so much diabetes in the family.At any rate, I'm not going to worry about it. He seems pretty healthy overall and that's what matters the most!Thanks again! :)April",

    "question": "My 4 year old's preschool teacher pulled me aside today concerned because he had to go potty 5 times while at preschool, which is 3 hours long. She said he did pee each time, because they wondered. She said this always concerns her because of diabetes. Now that I think about it I remember yesterday thinking he was going to the bathroom an awful lot.Now I'm flipping out because I have so much diabetes in my family it isn't even funny! It is so prevalent on my mom's side that I'm the only one who didn't get it. That's how prevalent it is.I would think if it was a bladder infection he would act like it hurt to pee, which he isn't. I don't want my mind to run wild with this but I would never want my baby to have to deal with something like this. I've seen the damage diabetes can do.I'm taking him in to the acute care clinic tonight but I was wondering what you all thought. Why is he peeing so much?",
