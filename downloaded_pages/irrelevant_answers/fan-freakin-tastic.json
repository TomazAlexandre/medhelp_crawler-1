I had GD with my DS, and although the diet was a PAIN especially with cravings, it really wasnt that bad. We were able to control it with diet and one pill a day. And although those of us with GD have a higher risk of developing type 2 later in life, those risks can also be cut significantly with diet and excercise!Best of Luck to you! I have my fingers crossed for good results!",

I didn't even fail it when I wasn't pregnant (when I found out I had PCOS I did the 3-hour).Okay, I'm going to go relax and focus on other things. Early bedtime tonight!!!

    "question": "My doctor's office just called with the GTT results. Mine are borderline! So what does that mean? Means a pregnant lady has to fast and do the 3-hour glucose test. I've done it before but I wasn't pregnant at the time. I hope I don't feel really woozy.Anyway, so my result was 137. The lab says over 139 is considered gestational diabetes. My doctor, however, wants it below 130. So I just need 2 or 3 of my blood draws to be under 130. If you're a praying person, pray! I do NOT want gestational diabetes. It means I'm at risk for \"regular\" diabetes later, something my brother has and my mom had. And now I'm stressing out. Ugh!So I scheduled my appointment for tomorrow, bright and early. Should have results Thursday!",
