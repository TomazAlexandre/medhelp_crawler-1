            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin without any rash can be due to skin causes like dermatitis, scabies, hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Please take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications after ruling out causes like scabies and systemic diseases. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "I just wanted to let you know that after multiple tests and blood draws by several different doctors someone FINALLY thought to check my B12 levels. As it turns out I have a level 207 out of 300 I also have an iron deficiency but I don't know the exact numbers. Apparently these two things combined can add up to extremely itchy skin due to damaged nerve endings. There are several other symptoms of a B12 deficiency I have been exhibiting as well such as moodiness and other personality changes, as well as disrupted sleeping patterns and even strange dreams. I never thought to put 2 and 2 together before and it astounds me that no one ever thought to check my B12 levels before considering I've had too many blood tests to count in the past year. I've been prescribed both iron and B12 supplement prescriptions and hopefully should be feeling better soon!",

    "question": "Please help me! I'm a 19 year old female living in the southeaster coastline. My skin itches so terribly on my legs and arms I cannot sleep. There's no rash at all and my skin appears to be normal other than the horrifying itch. It seems to happen worse at night and when I'm in and out of water (showers, ocean, pool, ect..) I've tried switching all my beauty products and laundry detergent, I apply lotion and itch cremes, and oatmeal baths but nothing works! I take massive amounts of antihistamines (2 24-hour Zyrtec tablets and 2 Benadryl tablets)\u00a0\u00a0and they help sometimes but its always short term and the itching resumes even worse than before. I don't know what to do, I can't sleep or focus on class or work or even fun things because I'm always itchy. I'm headed to the ER in the morning because I'm absolutely desperate. I've never been allergic to anything before and I wasn't under any stress when the symptoms began, if anything my stress has increased due to the itch. I need help, I'm desperate, I cant live like this.",
