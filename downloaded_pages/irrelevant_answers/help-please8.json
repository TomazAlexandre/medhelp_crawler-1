    "question": "i noticed a sudden weight gain, i called my doctor and he sent to for some blood work, he called me the next day and told me i was hyperthyroid, he then sent me to a specialist who retested me and has now scheduled me for a radioactive iodine uptake scan of thyroid, i am miserable i have gone from 225 to 280 in 5 weeks, both doctors are telling me that the weight gain isnt from the thyroid problems, but my diet hasnt changed and my activity level hasnt changed either, one dr is blaming it on my diabeties meds while the other insist the meds isnt doing it, can anyone tell me why the hell am i gaining so much weight? keep going like i am i'll be 350 lbs by christmas, and i cant do that, 6 years ago i worked my *** off going from 310 down to 225 where i been holding steady all these years",
