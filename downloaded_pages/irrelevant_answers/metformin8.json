I was told by my RE that as long as I bleed a little that is a good thng, its your bodies way of cleaning itself out. Have you spoken with your GYN? I was recommend you just talking to your GYN, since they know your medical history, and they would be able to determin if the bleeding you are having is ok or not.Good luck!",

            "answer": "My physician did order the test prior to putting me on Metformin. The reason was because they needed to see what my blood glucose was without medication intervention. A blood glucose test ordered to measure the amount of glucose in the blood right at the time of sample collection. It is also used to detect both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, to help diagnose diabetes, and to monitor glucose levels in persons with diabetes. Most doctors before putting a women on Metformin for PCOS, usually do one or all of the following blood test:Fasting Glucose Test,Fasting Insulin Test,Glucose/Insulin Ratio,Glycohemoglobin A1C (HbA1C). They are all test to check the amout of sugar in your blood. As you are prolly aware of abnormalities of blood sugar and insulin are quite common in PCOS.",
