            "answer": "Hi,It is difficult for me to interpret those results without knowing your lab's normal range and what time of day the blood was drawn.\u00a0\u00a0A morning cortisol level of 22.3 is not necessarily too high, but again I would need to know your lab's normal range(same for the ACTH). If either or both of your levels are high, your doctor will need to refer you to an Endocrinologist to have further testing done.You are not in eminent cardiac danger based only on those lab tests. If you have an underlying adrenal condition that is serious, you may have some consequences later down the line. The first thing is to determine if you have any adrenal problem in the first place, so be sure to follow up with your doctor soon. Try not to worry too much, and get some rest.Take care.",

    "question": "I know this question is not related to diabetes but did not know where else to post it. I recently had some test done as I was worried something hormonal might be causing my extreme fatigue all the time. My doctor ran numerous blood work and the only thing that came back out of normal was a cortisol level of 22.3 and a ACTH of 73. I'm just trying to make sense of all this as I've been dealing with a severe anxiety/panic disorder for a few months and I'm wondering if it is somehow related. I've read all these things and I'm not convinced something serious is wrong with me, maybe a tumor of some sort. I read how cortisol regulates the cardiovascular system so I'm now worried that since my levels are off I'm in cardiac danger. Any insight you can provide to calm my nervous would be wonderful.",
