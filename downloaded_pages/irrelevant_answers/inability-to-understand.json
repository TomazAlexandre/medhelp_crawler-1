Degenerative brain disease is one possibility, however the sudden onset suggests \"STROKE\" in large capital letters. And I suspect stroke from a slow bleed that is getting progressively worse,.Forget about \"an appointment\". You need an IMMEDIATE evaluation. Head for an ER.",

Urinate into a clear glass jar so that you can see what it looks like.A cloudy urine may mean that you have an infection.\u00a0\u00a0A dark urine may mean there may be visible blood or that you are dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0A urine that smells very strongly may too be an infection.Make sure that you do not get dehydrated, because that will make you feel unwell.\u00a0\u00a02 litres of water a day is usually recommended, but more if you sweat a lot.Severe depression, stress and anxiety can cause similar problems, even though you may think that you are fine you still may have any one these problems.\u00a0\u00a0I presume that no one has \"spiked\" any of your drinks!Ensure that you get sleep every night and have a good sleep hygiene.Have a healthy and well balanced diet with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables, lean meat, fish.\u00a0\u00a0Don't eat large portions at once, but smaller meals with a healthy snack in between.If your sugar levels drop, that can make you feel unwell too.\u00a0\u00a0Pre diabetes and diabetes\u00a0\u00a0don't always have any symptoms.Don't forget to book an appointment to see your doctor to get checked out.Let me know how you get on.Best wishes.",

Suddenly it feels so hard for me to connect the words and understand the overall speech..Sometimes, i feel like there's a pressure in my head..it feels heavy and like something is pushing it. People are saying that I'm just stress out and need a break but I'm not! I mean there's nothing for me to stress out..",
