But he still rolls all over the place and its starting to hurt almost like hes scratching the insides. Doesnt look like hes coming any time soon...hopefully these next 6 weeks go by fairly fast. I am really ready to get back into a routine around my house. All I do now is clean and shop for my boy and getting the house ready for him. Im running out of things to do lol.",
