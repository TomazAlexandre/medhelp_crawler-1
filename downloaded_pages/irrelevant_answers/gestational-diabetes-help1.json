            "answer": "Your sugar levels would have been back to normal by then for the test. So your results are correct. They should have you do a 3 hour test and if you fail that then you will have to monitor what you eat. Things that are high in carbs like pasta breads soda ect should be limited. I can only eat 45 carbs per meal and 15 per snack. 3 meals a day and 2-3 snacks.",

    "question": "So ive been eating pretty healthy and i dont eat candy or chocolate much but the weekend before my glucose test i went crazy! It was my husbands gender reveal/birthday party and i had a macaroon, cupcake, and\u00a0\u00a0strawberry fanta. And took my glucose the next day. Could it be that my numbers were so high because of the sugar that i had on the weekend!?Do you think they will let me retest??Please help!",
