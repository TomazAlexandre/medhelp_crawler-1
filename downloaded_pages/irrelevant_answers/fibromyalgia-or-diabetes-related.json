            "answer": "Hello,this sounds like neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0By normalizing blood sugars you allow the nerves to recover, and this recovery is painful.\u00a0\u00a0It can take 6 months or longer for the nerves to repair.You may want to ask the dr if you can try stopping lyrica if you are nno longer having pain.How are your blood sugars now? When we are diabetic, the very best thing we can do for our health is to achieve normal blood sugars (fasting 80 - 90, maximum post eating less than 120, or at most 140 would be optimum).",

            "answer": "It is absolutely amazing that people on this site can have the answer I'm looking for, yet several Dr's and nurses are telling me it may be in my head or that they have never heard of it! So thank you :) It did take around 6 months to finally be cured or repaired. It was extremely painful and it started when my sugar levels became normal. My sugar levels are fine now and I will never let them become out of control again. I did try capsaicin but it didn't help much for me. Thank you for your responses.",

    "question": "A while back I got my sugar levels to perfect after being high for years. I did it immediately and that's when things got bad. it started to feel like my skin was burning from the inside out... Mainly on my stomach, back, thighs and a bit on my arms. The pain was did not take a break. it was a constant feeling. I couldn't wear underwear or a bra, could hardly bare any clothes at all. I lost 10 kilos in about 2 weeks and had absolutely no appetite at all/ I also didn't sleep for weeks... I was exhausted and always wanted to lay down but that's when it hurt the most. After 3 months of Dr's and the ER telling me they didn't know what's wrong, finally a Dr put me on lyrica... It took around a month to start feeling better after that and now there is no pain at all... Has anybody experienced this?",
