            "answer": "I think most of us who have had angina attacks or a heart attack will have somewhat different symptoms, sometimes no symptoms, but generally cardiac chest pain doesn't increase when the area of the pain is touched.\u00a0\u00a0Also, cardiac symptoms are generally explained as 'pressure' or a 'clutching' sensation.\u00a0\u00a0That being said, something is causing you discomfort and as I have read and heard many times, chest pains need to be investigated.That said, you certainly have risk factors for CAD.\u00a0\u00a0You can't do anything about your genetic makeup, but I'd sure try to get off the cigarettes and see what stress reduction measures you can make in your life.\u00a0\u00a0My grandfather used to call cigarettes 'Pimp sticks'.\u00a0\u00a0I used that derogatory term for them when I quit smoking to remind myself what an idiot I was to smoke... it helped.Hope you can get checked out.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes.",

            "answer": "First off, with your family history you need to stop smoking for sure. Flycaster is right, cardiac pain is different for everyone but it is not likely to increase by touching the area that hurts. Also, cardiac pain from an impending heart attack does not necessarily last for days, although angina can come or go and there are variants that come on at rest and under stress. It's best to see you doctor, don't take a chance.Good Luck,Jon",
