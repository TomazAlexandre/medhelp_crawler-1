            "answer": "Stop feeling sorry for yourself and put yourself first! Take care of you (or it will be impossible to take care of anyone else). There is no magic pill. Get up and move at least once an hour. Start walking five minutes out and five minutes back. Increase by five minutes each day so you gradually build up your walk to at least 30 min a day. Don't go on a diet! Just count or journal everything you eat. There are apps for that. I have learned that I can eat quite well at 130g carbs plus earned extra carbs from my walks. Stop thinking in negative terms. Think about what you CAN do instead of what you think you can't. And smile. I just tried to take my blood sugar by jamming my test strip into my iPhone power port.",
