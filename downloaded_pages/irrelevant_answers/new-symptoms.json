            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.The most important and common causes of sugar in urine are diabetes and pregnancy, but both these causes have been excluded in your case.Other causes include Cushing\u2019s syndrome in which there is excess secretion of cortisol hormone, fanconi\u2019s syndrome (malfunction of the kidneys which results in secretion of glucose and aminoacids in urine) and chronic renal failure. It may help to get yourself evaluated for kidney functions.Your symptoms indicate abdominal migraines although abdominal migraines are more common in children.http://headaches.about.com/od/migrainediseas1/a/what_abdom_mx.htmNSAIDS and triptans usually provide relief. Take care!",

    "question": "I wrote in about a month ago or so regarding migraines and the relation to my MRI on my brain that showed a white spot...Since then I have had new and worse symptoms. I recently passed out at work, both arms completely numb, as well as the sides of my face (from my temples to my chin), I experienced SEVERE abdominal pain, vomiting and extreme pressure on the top part of my head... I was then taken to the ER where I was only given a pregnancy test (which results were negative!),they did however find sugar in my urine, they gave a pill for the stomach pain and then I was sent on my way!I had 2 more episodes that same week...I went to my family doctor where again, I had to pee in a cup... they again found sugar in my urine?! (note: i had to fast for this docs appt.) I then had labwork done which came back completely normal. (AIC was 5.7)Any ideas as to how sugar could be spilling into my urine and any thoughts as to where my symptoms might be coming from?Thanks so much for your time,-Jen-",
