            "answer": "I'm with emcee223 - you should go see a doctor. It could be caused by low blood pressure - I used to experience similar symptoms - a little coffee or caffeine, more salt, can help raise the blood pressure to prevent dizziness or falling. But it could also be a small seizure, or something more complicated, and you'll want to see a doctor if they're getting worse.",

    "question": "All of a sudden usually once or twice a day i all of a sudden at random times doing different things start feeling very light headed and dizzy, i need to grab something to keep me stable so i dont fall down, it only lasts for about 5-10 second and at the end of it my arms and head get very warm and a little bit tingly. Its been happening for almost 3 months now and it hasnt been much of a problem until this week when i passed out in the shower because of it, i got that feeling and next thing i remember was on the ground and had cut my lip. Im a 14 almost 15 year old boy so i want to get an idea on what it could be before alarming my parents.",
