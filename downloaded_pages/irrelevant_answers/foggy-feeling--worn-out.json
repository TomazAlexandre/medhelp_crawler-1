            "answer": "Hi! What you have is probably brain fog and it can be due to several causes like liver dysfunction (get liver enzymes done\u2014liver function test), kidney dysfunction (get kidney function test done), and anemia. Poor sleep pattern and sleep problems like sleep apnea too can cause brain fog. You may sleep your customary 8-10 hours, feel fresh and yet have a sleep problem. Sleep studies by sleep specialists can help diagnose this. Low Vit D or Vit B12 too could be the cause. Hypothyroidism, diabetes (maybe these two are ruled out) and hormonal imbalance in men- this could be related to low testosterone, should be investigated. Since calcium is high, rule out parathyroid gland problem-talk to the endocrine specialist about it.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Take care!",

    "question": "3 months ago I started having this foggy feeling in my head I started feeling worn out. It just suddenly started one day at school during first period and ever since then the symptoms havent gone away. When i wake up in the morning I can feel those symptoms, but every day in first period at school the symptoms really start to kick in. On the weekend I feel the symptoms all day. In December I started feeling worse. I started being in a bad mood all of the time and I get pissed off easier. I used to always be in a good mood and I almost never got pissed off. I also used to like to be sociable, but now I avoid talking to people because I'm in such a bad mood. I went to a psychologist and he put me on Zyprexa about a week ago. I also went to the allergy doctor about 2 weeks ago and they put me on allegra. I also went to the endocrinologist about 2 weeks ago and he said nothing was wrong. I have taken blood tests and my calcium level is slighty high, my billiruben was also slighty high. Also I tried exercising to make me feel better but that put me in a depressed mood and made me feel worse. This forum is pretty much a last resort because I dont know what else to do. Thanks",
