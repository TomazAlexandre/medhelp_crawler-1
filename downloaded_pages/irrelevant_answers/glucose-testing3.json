            "answer": "Seems lots of women fail the 1 hour test and somewhat depends on the cut off that your hospital/doctor uses. My hospital also used 130. All I can say is just b/c you failed that screening does not mean you will fail the 3 hour test and end up with diagnosis of gestational diabetes. I was worried at the time too, but in my case the 3 hour testing came back normal after I failed the screening, which I've heard over again from other women. On the other hand, if you do end up with the diagnosis, it often goes away as soon as baby (well rather placenta) delivers. It seems for many women just meeting with a nutritionist to figure out best foods and times to eat during the day helps with gd, so one doesn't always end up with severe case requiring meds. There also seems to be some confusion about how to prepare for the 3 hour test, but I ended up fasting from 10 pm the night before and for about 3 days prior had at least 3 to 4 servings per day of fruit, dairy, carbs, etc -- just generally eat well but add in carbs if you don't normally. Or do what your doctor told you if otherwise. Online you can see common carbs to eat like crackers, bananas, etc. Good luck!",

            "answer": "we can't say what your chances of having GD is, but like the previous poster mentioned, failing the 1 hr does not mean you will fail the 3 hr. i failed the 1 hr with 148, and easily passed all parts of the 3 hr.",

            "answer": "BTW, did you do anything that may have made the screening # so high like drink high sugar drink beforehand? One of my friends claims that b/c she drank gaterade right before, she got a very high screening # but then went on to pass the 3 hour test. She only drank it b/c of some bad advice from someone else. I think you're supposed to just eat as you usually do before the screening. Good luck!",

    "question": "I did the 1 hour glucose testing and the result was 165. They like it to be 130 or less. I now have to take the 3 hour test. My baby is measuring 3 weeks ahead. What are the chances of my having gestational diabetes?",
