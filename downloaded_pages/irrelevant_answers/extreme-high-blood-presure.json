            "answer": "I would certainly see another doctor, preferrably a cardiologist, it seems to me that there should be something that would help. There are many blood pressure pills on the market, and sometimes, even, IV drips of blood pressure meds to get a large dose in the patient to help get the pressure lowered quickly, then, they take the pill version.",

It is really uncommon that heart diseases or stress cause blood pressure at that level.",
