            "answer": "I can only imagine what you are experiencing. I was looking at Oprah the other day and saw the talk-show host Montel Williams on there and he was literally in tears on the show speaking of\u00a0\u00a0this same condition (MS). I felt so bad for him because the way that he describes the pain seems so intense. I hear that this disease is worse than Rheumatoid Arthritis alone. My heart go out to you and I pray to God that you are healed in his name. Sometimes the power of prayer changes things. I don't profess to being a religious person but I do know that prayer changes things. I know that it is hard because of your condition and I am in no way saying that you are not in pain but just no one thing, \"life and death is in the power of the tongue.\" I believe that you are in excruciating pain but I also believe that alot of conditions can be psychological because of the expectance as humans.Fyi: I suffer from \"mitral valve prolapse\"\u00a0\u00a0and hidrendentitis. I take Atenolol for the Mitral Valve and my high blood pressure but it is controlled with diet; Now the hidrendentitis is another story. This can be a very painful endurement because it cause large boils to in my case come under my arms but for alot of people it causes conditions in the groin and even under the breasts. This is pain, pain, painful. It is like when I am overheated, I sweat as if a cascade of water is falling on me and this causes bacteria to enter my skin in which I was told by numerous doctors that I am allergic to my own sweat and it would be a great interest to shed a few pounds-I did and to this day, I still have flares when I wear deodorant or certain soaps w/ perfumes. It is horrible because I figure, who wants to go without deodorant? I have tried everything and it stops and starts up again. There is very little known to doctors of this condition and because there aren't enough people with this condition, they cannot make money so it is usually treated with antibiotics which is a negative to me because the ones that are super strong cause yeast infections. This is where the frustration begins. I've said all that to say this, I again can only imagine what you are going through because our conditions only similarity is that the doctors can't give a definite answer. The world of medicine has always been a mystery to me because of the risks of side effects and what may be approved by the FDA may not always be safe later on.So continue to do research on your condition and hopefully we people that needs medical attention will find a way.",

            "answer": "Wow, what a terrible, horrific year you have truly had.\u00a0\u00a0The Type II Diabetes and the possible MS are not related to each other, but it is common to have the two just because the diabetes is so common.The pain in both diabetes and in MS is primarily nerve pain, so it is important for you to get on some round-the-clock treatment for nerve pain.\u00a0\u00a0Typically the narcotics do not work very well for nerve pain - not nearly as well as they do for acute, somatic pain.\u00a0\u00a0Examples of meds used for nerve pain are Gabapentin, Lyrica and Carbamazepine.\u00a0\u00a0Can you see if your PCP can get you into a pain clinc?\u00a0\u00a0It is tragic that people who need pain meds, especially narcotics, are treated so badly by the medical profession.\u00a0\u00a0I would hope that with the right treatment you would need fewer narcotics.The long waits to see your neurologist are just unacceptable.\u00a0\u00a0Are you being seen at LA County?\u00a0\u00a0I know what a monster of a place that center is.We have two Health Pages that deal with Neuropathic (Nerve) Pain.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you read them.\u00a0\u00a0They were written by an actual pain management doc that visited here.Welcome again.Quix",

            "answer": "I am SOOO sorry to hear about the horrible symptoms you are having.\u00a0\u00a0Quix knows best as usual, try to get something for nerve pain (maybe you already have).\u00a0\u00a0Read the Health Pages about how they work though because they are not an instant relief.I can't believe you have to wait soo long to see a neuro with all of your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I put my name on a cancellation list at my Neuro and that got me in a month sooner, but HOLY COW DEC. Really?\u00a0\u00a0sorry I am just astounded.\u00a0\u00a0Our Medical System *****!I don't know how much the neuro will help though.\u00a0\u00a0My neuro did basically nothing to help me get answers and relief.\u00a0\u00a0He gave me a prescription for Rebif and jacked my Gabapentin up and said see you in 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0The visit to him left me frustrated and seeking more help.\u00a0\u00a0I have no where near the problems you are having to deal with and I would hope that your visit (when you finally get it cuz Dec is just insane!!!) gives you some solid answers and a feeling of comfort about what you are dealing with.\u00a0\u00a0Even if you are able to travel possibly?\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure what your medical coverage may be or allow.\u00a0\u00a0You are right,\u00a0\u00a0you need an MS specialist.I have to sympathize with you on the medication addiction accusation.\u00a0\u00a0I had my first experience with that this week when my Neuro upped my gabapentin from 600mg to 2700mg a day.\u00a0\u00a0It can make a person feel really angry and frustrated when you are just trying to be honest and get help.I do hope you get some relief both physically and mentally because the pain of not having answers can hurt just as bad sometimes.Take care and keep us posted.D",

    "question": "*Sigh*So this year has been horrible for me.\u00a0\u00a0At the end of April 2008 I was diagnosed with Diabetes II and at the end of September 2008 I was diagnosed with MS.\u00a0\u00a0It feels like I\u2019m totally falling apart.The way I was diagnosed with Diabetes was purely by accident.\u00a0\u00a0I was urinating a lot for about a month and drinking water by the gallon so on a whim I went next door to my neighbor and had her check my blood sugar (her husband is a diabetic) and that\u2019s when everything changed.\u00a0\u00a0Her jaw dropped and pricked me 5 more times before I finally understood something was wrong.\u00a0\u00a0Her machine couldn\u2019t read my blood.\u00a0\u00a0All it kept saying was high.\u00a0\u00a0She explained to me that it meant that my sugar was over 500.\u00a0\u00a0I brushed it off for a minute but then decided to go to the emergency room.\u00a0\u00a0It turns out my sugar was around 900.\u00a0\u00a0I didn\u2019t understand back then that I was extremely lucky that I hadn\u2019t fallen into a diabetic coma.That was the beginning of me taking pills every day.\u00a0\u00a0I started taking six in the morning and 1 at night.\u00a0\u00a0I really hated having to take those 6 pills every day now I long for just 7 pills a day.\u00a0\u00a0Made/makes me feel like a real old lady (no offense intended) but I stuck with it.\u00a0\u00a0Not like I had a choice, right?Two weeks after I was diagnosed my vision changed suddenly.\u00a0\u00a0My glasses stopped working.\u00a0\u00a0One morning I woke up and I couldn\u2019t read anymore.\u00a0\u00a0This was attributed with my Diabetes but now I\u2019m wondering if maybe that was the first sign of my MS.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t know.On September 25, 2008 I woke up with my right foot feeling like it was asleep/numb and it hurt a little.\u00a0\u00a0It was just from my knee down.\u00a0\u00a0I figured it was nothing and that as I went about my normal day it would go away.\u00a0\u00a0Well, it didn\u2019t.\u00a0\u00a0It spread.\u00a0\u00a0By Sunday, September 28 a lot of my body was numb and what made me finally go into the emergency was that my head started to go numb and hurt.\u00a0\u00a0I thought maybe I was having a stroke or something.\u00a0\u00a0After 16 hours in the emergency room and a cat scan I left (I wasn\u2019t discharged.\u00a0\u00a0I was tired and hungry and just wanted to go home) as soon as the neurologist examined me and said it didn\u2019t look like I had a stroke or anything.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing she did say was that my brain was atrophied (smaller than it should be for someone my age) but that was so congenial and not a problem since I developed normally.To my surprise I got a call an hour and half later from the emergency saying that the neurologist had wanted to admit to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0Why is it that a doctor can\u2019t tell their patient what they are thinking?\u00a0\u00a0I figured out what they thought I had while walking the hospital halls (I walked around to help with the numbness).\u00a0\u00a0So I was admitted and stayed there for 5 days.\u00a0\u00a0I was \u201ctentatively\u201d diagnosed on September 30 and had a lumbar puncture immediately after I was told what they thought I had based on the MRI I had the day before.\u00a0\u00a0The MRI itself was a surprise to me since I was told the day before that I wasn\u2019t going to have one but then was taken away for one that same night.\u00a0\u00a0I wish doctors would just communicate with me more and make up their minds.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that I was having another test because they thought my numbness was due to my diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Guess that wasn\u2019t the case, right?So I went home on October 3rd with the promise I would get an appointment to go see a neurologist by the following week.\u00a0\u00a0 Well that didn\u2019t happen.\u00a0\u00a0After a lot of trips to the hospital (I get treated at a major university/county hospital) I finally have an appointment for December 12th.\u00a0\u00a0That alone took a lot of begging and pleading.In the meantime I feel like I\u2019ve gotten worse.\u00a0\u00a0They only discharged me with a prescription of Rebif.\u00a0\u00a0I went to my primary doctor and she gave me 3 more drugs but sometimes I wonder if they\u2019re working because I don\u2019t feel any improvement.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m grateful to her because at least she\u2019s trying but I know I need a specialist.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve been to the emergency 3 times because I just can\u2019t take the pain.\u00a0\u00a0The first time they took me seriously and I was seen in 4 hours (I was ecstatic because that was quick for ER standards) and was given a shot of morphine (I didn\u2019t feel anything.\u00a0\u00a0It was the first time I was ever given that) and a prescription for Percocet.\u00a0\u00a0Oh and the promise that they were going to make the neurology clinic give me a sooner appointment.\u00a0\u00a0Well, that didn\u2019t happen.\u00a0\u00a0Surprise?The last 2 times the ER triage nurses didn\u2019t believe when I said that I couldn\u2019t take sitting in chairs for 12 hours.\u00a0\u00a0You see my back hurts a lot.\u00a0\u00a0I can only sit up for half an hour at a time.\u00a0\u00a0After that I have to lie down. So I would just come home.\u00a0\u00a0Then I tried going to the walk in clinic at my Dr\u2019s since I couldn\u2019t get an appointment with her.\u00a0\u00a0When I went and asked for a refill on the Percocet they treated me like drug addict.\u00a0\u00a0I hated it.\u00a0\u00a0They tried to push me off to my primary doctor but I got a prescription for the Percocet.\u00a0\u00a0You\u2019d think I would be happy, right?\u00a0\u00a0I tried to fill the prescription and it turns out that they didn\u2019t have the drug and couldn\u2019t order.\u00a0\u00a0I asked for the prescription back to have it filled somewhere else and it turns out that since it\u2019s a narcotic it couldn\u2019t only be filled there.\u00a0\u00a0So I was screwed and was given Vicodin.\u00a0\u00a0That was the first drug they tried to push off on me but I refused it because I had tried that before going in and it didn\u2019t help.\u00a0\u00a0To make it worse they gave me a joke for a prescription.\u00a0\u00a0They said to take one every eight hours.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t normally do this.\u00a0\u00a0You know, not follow prescription directions but in this case I felt like I was left no choice.So that\u2019s where I\u2019m basically at.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m already running out of the Vicodin (still taking it with the hope that it\u2019s actually doing something but taking 2 every 6 hours).\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m at my wits end.\u00a0\u00a0I can\u2019t get into the neurologist till the middle of December.\u00a0\u00a0Getting an appointment somewhere else is nearly impossible.\u00a0\u00a0I can\u2019t wait another 3 to 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0I started off with numbness\u00a0\u00a0in my legs and my arms and now I have that and severe pain everywhere, some tremors, insomnia and I\u2019m noticing cognitive problems.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m starting to stutter and that\u2019s scarring the heck out of me.\u00a0\u00a0Is that normal?\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m also having problems with incontinence.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve told every Dr. I\u2019ve seen about that and nobody has given me anything for it.\u00a0\u00a0Is there anything to help with that or should I just start shopping for diapers?I\u2019m sorry this has been so long.\u00a0\u00a0I guess just needed to vent.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m just getting tired with dealing with Dr\u2019s pills and everything else since nobody seems to be listening to me or ignoring what I\u2019m saying.\u00a0\u00a0My diabetes is under control but this MS attack doesn\u2019t seem to want to go away.\u00a0\u00a0Being diagnosed with both MS and diabetes ***** because the doctors really don\u2019t seem to know which of the diseases I have is causing my symptoms.",
