            "answer": "Try replacing some of the sugar in your diet with healthy fats, such as olive or coconut oil, nuts and nut butters... Olive and coconut oils help you eat less at meal time and stay satisfied longer after a meal, plus they help cut cravings.\u00a0\u00a0I saute' my veggies in, either, olive or coconut oil or drizzle one or the other over steamed veggies to add flavor; fry eggs in coconut oil or butter.\u00a0\u00a0To cut the coconut flavor from coconut oil, simply add a pinch of salt.Eat breakfast before you go to work - have scrambled eggs cooked in either butter or coconut oil to keep you satisfied until lunch; or mix 1 tbsp coconut oil with your morning oatmeal then add cinnamon to taste for sweetness. You can also drizzle your lunch salad with olive oil to keep you satisfied through the afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0If you snack you can have peanut butter with an apple... the peanut butter has both fat and protein and the apple is chock full of fiber.Keep in mind that I'm not advocating huge amounts of fat... just a tablespoon or so at each meal.",
