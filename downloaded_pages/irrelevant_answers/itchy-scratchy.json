            "answer": "I just saw this post and was wondering how your mother is doing?There are several possible explanations for her rash.\u00a0\u00a0She could have had an allergic reaction to medication that was administered during surgery.\u00a0\u00a0If it is due to that, it may take several weeks for it to work itself out of her system.\u00a0\u00a0 Or her body may be responding to the pacemaker itself.\u00a0\u00a0Anything is possible.Has she had her liver enzymes checked?\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes if they are elevated it can cause excessive itching.\u00a0\u00a0The enzymes could be elevated temporarily due to side effects of medication that was administered.One other thing to check would be to have your mother's pharmacist cross reference her medications list and see if there could be something contraindicated with any of her medications.",

    "question": "My mother has kidney disease and has started dialysis. She had a pace maker placed 2 weeks ago and ever since she has broken out in a whole body rash and no one can say what it is or where it came from. Her skin looks like the skin of a chicken, very fine small bumps all over that are extremely itchy from the inside out. We have tried everything over the counter and natural and all be it the outside is clearing up peeling and drying out the itching on the inside is still there. She is on an anti itch pills hydroxizyne already and this does not even begin to help the itch. What could it be, what can we do? Her history is as follows: L.A.M (lung disease) is on oxygen 24/7, Diabetes, Nueropathy, kidney failure, heart failure - Pacemaker implanted 2 weeks ago & high blood pressure. Being treated for it all meds are sensipar, metropolal tartrate, famatodine, asprin 325mg, insulin 70/30, Gabapentine, hydroxyzine, reneval, advair 250/250. I may have missed one doing this off the top of my head but this is the bulk of it. She takes dialysis 3 days a week also. Please help this is messing with her breathing and her mood.",
