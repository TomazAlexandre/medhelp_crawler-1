            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Numbness and tingling of hands and feet can happen due to peripheral vascular disease or disorder of the circulatory system outside of the brain and heart. Other causes are hypothyroidism, eating disorders like anorexia, Vit B12 deficiency, Lyme\u2019s disease, Addison\u2019s disease, adrenal causes like pheochromocytoma, anemia, Buerger\u2019s disease, chronic fatigue syndrome and Raynaud\u2019s disease. You will need some tests like treadmill test, color Doppler, angiography, ultrasonography and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).Numbness and tingling in sleep predominantly during sleep can\u00a0\u00a0also be a sleep disorder. Take care!",
