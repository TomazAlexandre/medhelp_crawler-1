I am constantly looking and reading about every article on migraines to try to find an answer for her.\u00a0\u00a0It is so hard to sit and watch your child suffer like this.\u00a0\u00a0She can not go to school and a lot of the day is spent in her room (dark and quiet) alone.\u00a0\u00a0This is no way for a 16 year old to live her life.\u00a0\u00a0She should be enjoying High School and hanging out with friends and working, but she's not.\u00a0\u00a0Any advise or comments?",

She is taking vitamins, eating healthy, exercising 3 times a week and taking anti depressants. She is also having random headaches that trigger her lying down unable to respond but can hear people talking to her. We have ruled out seizures and diabetes.",
