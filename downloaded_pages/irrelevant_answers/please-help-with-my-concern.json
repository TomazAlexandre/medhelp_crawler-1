            "answer": "Welcome to the forum.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your question; I also glanced at your discussion on the community forum.\u00a0\u00a0(We don't see those discussions routinely, but often look before responding to a new question here.)It would seem you have some sexually oriented anxieties that are inflating this whole business far beyond reason.\u00a0\u00a0Since you have consistently used condoms, you have never been at significant risk of HIV. But in any case, your many test results are definitive.\u00a0\u00a0And apparently you have misunderstood something basic about HIV diagnosis:\u00a0\u00a0it is simply not true that \"at some stage antibodies are hard to detect\".\u00a0\u00a0That is ONLY true in the first few weeks after infection.\u00a0\u00a0Once you had a negative antibody test more than 8 weeks after your last sexual exposure (or for even more security, 3 months or more after that event), the results proved you were not infected.\u00a0\u00a0Any and all tests after that point were superfluous.\u00a0\u00a0The specific kinds of tests (e.g., ELISA, ICMA, oral swab, etc) don't make any difference.\u00a0\u00a0You do not need PCR or any other testing.So it is time to stop testing and stop worrying.\u00a0\u00a0If you find yourself continuing to obsess about it, professional counseling might be in order.\u00a0\u00a0It is not normal to remain so anxious about HIV after the repeated, science-based reassurance you have had (perhaps from your own doctor, as well as MedHelp).\u00a0\u00a0I suggest it from compassion, not criticism.I hope this has helped.\u00a0\u00a0And before you ask any follow-up questions for clarification, please think very carefully.\u00a0\u00a0Unless the timing of your tests is inaccurate, there is no information you can provide that would possibly change my opinion or advice.Best wishes--\u00a0\u00a0HHH, MD",

            "answer": "Drhappy new year,Contrary to your advice I did use the home access to test one more time at 24 weeks. Which came back negative.Does Having Diabetes or using a nasal Cortizone affect the results of the hiv testing as I am not on any diabetes medication yet.Please respond to allay my fears. Thanks",

            "answer": "As I said, \"there is no information you can provide that would possibly change my opinion or advice\".\u00a0\u00a0There are no medications or medical conditions that have any effect on HIV test reliability, with the possible exceptions of severe life-threatening illnesses like terminal cancer and potent chemotherapy or high dose immunosuppressive drugs.\u00a0\u00a0Even these are theoretical, with few if any actual known cases.\u00a0\u00a0For sure your diabetes or nasal cortisone had no effect.\u00a0\u00a0Your negative tests are competely reliable.",
