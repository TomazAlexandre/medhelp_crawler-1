            "answer": "Hello,I have also done a lot of training (am triathlete).\u00a0\u00a0I strongly recommend that you get your extra carbs from real food, which will also give you vitamins and minerals.For intense exercise lasting more than 1 hour you should eat a small snack before exercise, then some food maximum of about 200 - 300 calories per hour.\u00a0\u00a0Ideal foods for training are bananas, which are easy to eat, good for you, and contain plenty of carbs.After workout eat a meal that contains both carbs and protein to help maximise the benefits of your workout.\u00a0\u00a0Baked potato with cheese and meat?\u00a0\u00a0Pasta with meat sauce.\u00a0\u00a0Egg sandwhich. If you don't have a chance to eat a meal something like some chocolate milk is also an excellent snack.The latest research that I have read about says don't overdo the carbs, as too much sugar can supress benefits of working out.",

To get home is a half hour way by car, although I am not in favor of supplements, I will try them for a month only to gain some muscle. Any suggestions on the grams? I heard about 90 grams a day but i think is too much, I think about 30-40 with the protein is ok, but I am not sure.",
