            "answer": "The feet burning sounds like peripheral neuropathy & you may want to consult a neurologist about this.\u00a0\u00a0While they can't always figure out the cause, there are certain tests that can be run that will help pin it down in a number of cases.\u00a0\u00a0Your calves feel tired- are they hurting as well?\u00a0\u00a0If so, you may want to ask your doctor for doppler diagnostic testing to see if you have peripheral vascular disease or PAD.\u00a0\u00a0Also, have you had your potassium level in your blood checked lately?\u00a0\u00a0If you are low in potassium, that's one cause for calf muscles feeling tired.\u00a0\u00a0Hope you can see a doctor about these symptoms and get a proper diagnostic work-up & treatment!",

            "answer": "It very well could be a diabetes issue that is causing your symptoms, but regardless of whether it's PAD or pheripheral vascular disease, I agree you need to have this investigated quickly.\u00a0\u00a0In either case, good drugs coupled with exercise are essential.\u00a0\u00a0I was the poster boy for bad diet and poor cardiac health and had both PAD and PVD.\u00a0\u00a0I was able to develop collateral arteries through excercise and good medications, but the diabetes issues don't reverse... once the nerves are damaged, I don't think they can re-generate.\u00a0\u00a0I sure could be wrong about this, but I have never re-gained feeling to my feet.",
