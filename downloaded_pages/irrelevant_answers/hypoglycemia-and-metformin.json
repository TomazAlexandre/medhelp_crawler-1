            "answer": "I would be sure to get a second opinion. Run as fast as you can from this doctor and go find another one. If you live near a major teaching hospital (College University that has a medical school) go there. This is where doctors get trained and learn all the new medicine after they get licensed to \"practice\". Here is where you will find the experts.If your sons last two numbers were accurate he's hypoglycemic, and does NOT require Metformin, especially at the doses you mentioned. To say your son needs to go up to 1000 mg daily is borderline insanity.Here's why I say that. My monthly fasting glucose averages 122-129 mg/dl. And my HbA1c is 6%, sometimes at 5.9%. My Metformin dose was 250 mg ONCE daily. I increased that to 500 mg once daily in order to eat fruit. That's it!Make an appointment with a nutrionist too to see why your son has an eating disorder.",

    "question": "My son is 24 years old and just had a 3 hour fasting glucose tolerance test.\u00a0\u00a0His fasting blood was 88, his next count after drinking the sugary liquid was 102, his next two were 69 and 61.\u00a0\u00a0It seems like he has hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0He was told he has pre-diabetes and given a prescription for metformin 500 mg to take once a day for a week and to increase by a pill a day/week until he would be taking 4 pills/day within a month.\u00a0\u00a0Everything I have read says that this is given for high blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0He is also very underweight.\u00a0\u00a0I am very confused as to the purpose of this medication.",
