Does he have history of diabetes or hypertension?For now nothing to be worried about until repeat result shows more than 1.6 level.

            "answer": "Hi,My creatine runs on the average 2.5, and has for about 6 years.\u00a0\u00a0It can be rather scary, but once you are on the right track with your doctors, things will calm down.\u00a0\u00a0Just make sure you listen to them, and do everything that they tell you, because once your creatinine goes over into the 3's there's not much they can do to bring it down other than dialysis.\u00a0\u00a0Ask your doctors about what role animal protein serves in your case, as I went to the mayo clinic in jacksonville and they put me on a low protein(no more than 4 ounces a day) of meat in an effort to preserve my kidney function.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps...I can be emailed at ***@****Christa",

            "answer": "personally I dont like the sound of it.\u00a0\u00a0I am 50 and have chronic kidney disease, confirmed with ultrasounds and many kidney function tests.\u00a0\u00a0My creatinine, before the onset, sat at around 95, egfr 79 to 85. There has been a steady but rapid fall in egfr and rise in creatinine, over only 9 months. My last result for creatinine was identical to yours, 1.6 and my egfr has now dropped to the low 30s to 40 tends to fluctuate. showing the higher creatinine the more my kidney function has decreased. consistently high creatinine is a sign of kidney disease.\u00a0\u00a0I am in stage 3 but bordering now on stage 4. yiou need to take this seriously and have it rechecked a few more times.\u00a0\u00a0I am now under a nephrologist, May I ask your age?\u00a0\u00a0you should request a kindey function test to be safe.",

            "answer": "Sir,My father is diabetic (Type2). In Feb 2012 his creatine showed a reading of 0.93. He was advised a new vitamin (Maxum) since he was feeling weak and high on Cholesterol as well. Earlier he was not taking any vitamin medicines. In May 2012, his creating level has shot upto 1.63. Does it mean that within 2 months his kidney function has become worse. He is 65 yrs old. Or could it be because of the Maxum vitamin tablets. He is not reporting any abnormal body function though. Should I give me more fluids (water) and ask him to take a test after 2 weeks to see if his creatinine level has gone down. Is there any way that this creatine level can be brought down. Will appreciate your reply since we are from a very remote place with no access to a nephrologist.Rakesh.",
