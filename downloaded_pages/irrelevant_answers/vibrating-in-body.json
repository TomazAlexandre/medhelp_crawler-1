            "answer": "So I posted a few back and just wanted to follow up because it seems people still find this page often.a couple of days after my episode I got so sick I couldn't even get out of bed to go to the doctors. After sleeping for almost 2 days straight I managed to get enough energy to go. They took a bunch of blood samples and found my vitamin D was dangerously low and starting to effect my thyroid. Everything else people have suggested to cause this hand paralysis, like electrolytes and vitamin b was normal. Honestly I thought it was Lymne disease and thank god it wasn't. So the only conclusion I can draw at this point is somehow a combination of dehydration, lack of vitamin D and the extreme nausea triggered some kind of temporary nerve blockage to my hands.I have to go on prescription supplements for a few months, so I was suggest getting your blood tested for anyone this happens to again.",

            "answer": "Oops wrong thread...But I get that too. I googled it and people seem to call them \"inner earthquakes\" I believe mine is caused by my medication. If your doctor thinks it could be anything that could cause long term harm they should run some tests.",
