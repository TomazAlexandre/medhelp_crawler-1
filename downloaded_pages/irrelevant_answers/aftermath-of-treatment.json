            "answer": "Hi Barry, I did the tx in 2004, suffer anxiety (which I have now stabilised by taking vitamins/supplements), my moods are terrible and can go into a rage as well.\u00a0\u00a0Memory is real bad, cant remember what I did yesterday so to speak.\u00a0\u00a0I feel I have lost control of my emotions and feelings.My friend did the tx 7 years ago, and his memory issues are still a concern, he also cleared the virus.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that the virus lives in the tissues/brain even if you clear the virus, which may also explain why we suffer 'brain fog'. These symptoms are also experience by people with HCV who have not had treatment.\u00a0\u00a0See study by Daniel Forton et al 2001 - Evidence for a cerebral effect for the hepatitis C virus. (Lancet, Vol 358. pp38-39).",

            "answer": "My memory seems better after a year post tx. Also my rage after riba is much better too. Are you on a anti depressant?\u00a0\u00a0I think that may help. It sounds like you need to see a psychiatrist who can prescribe something for these symtoms. I had anxiety attacks, years ago. I went to a hypnotist. I really helped, I have never had them again. I do get anxious at times, but nothing like I did before. Exercise is great. Also Vit. B.",

            "answer": "J Hepatol. 2008 Nov;49(5):831-44. Epub 2008 Aug 21.Hepatitis C infection and risk of diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.White DL, Ratziu V, El-Serag HB.Section of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Baylor College of Medicine, Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.AbstractBACKGROUND/AIMS: Several studies found hepatitis C (HCV) increases risk of Type II diabetes mellitus (DM). However, others found no or only sub-group specific excess risk. We performed meta-analyses to examine whether HCV infection does increase DM risk in comparison to the general population and in other sub-groups with increased liver disease rates including with hepatitis B (HBV). METHODS: We followed standard guidelines for performance of meta-analyses. Two independent investigators identified eligible studies through structured keyword searches in relevant databases including PubMed. RESULTS: We identified 34 eligible studies. Pooled estimators indicated significant DM risk in HCV-infected cases in comparison to non-infected controls in both retrospective (OR(adjusted)=1.68, 95% CI 1.15-2.20) and prospective studies (HR(adjusted)=1.67, 95% CI 1.28-2.06). Excess risk was also observed in comparison to HBV-infected controls (OR(adjusted)=1.80, 95% CI 1.20-1.40) with suggestive excess observed in HCV+/HIV+ cases in comparison to HIV+ controls (OR(unadjusted)=1.82, 95% CI 1.27-2.38). CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of excess DM risk with HCV infection in comparison to non-infected controls is strengthened by consistency of results from both prospective and retrospective studies. The excess risk observed in comparison to HBV-infected controls suggests a potential direct viral role in promoting DM risk, but this needs to be further examined.",
