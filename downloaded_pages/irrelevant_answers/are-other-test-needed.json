            "answer": "Be sure that you first let the peds endo assess things, do not ask for specific testing,rather let them run the show with some good education from them so you are involved in understanding what is going to be looked at, also have a copy of the mri if one was done, to accurately view the pituitary an mri with and without contrast is the best study, they may want to have peds neurosurgery look at it as well, there are many children I care for who are incidentally found to have cysts and are terrific pituitary hormone wise. So expect a full history and physical, and maybe some labs and perhaps orders to repeat imaging of the pituitary.",

            "answer": "In order to diagnose a true blood sugar problem it has got to be based on labs not just symptoms, what you may see as \"blood sugar\"headaches may not really be due to a sugar problem that needs medicine to treat like diabetes, he may definitely have a little insulin resistance being on steroids, but actually manage his sugars overall just fine due to his compensation in insulin secretion, if indeed the endo did the labs including hba1c, insulin and c-peptide, a fasting blood sugar and urinalysis, this is very very reassuring that you do not need to stress as much about the sugar, rather I would highly recommend that you talk with your child's asthma specialist about the steroids and modify this regimen as well as focus on the diet to prevent any rapid weight gain that also leads to insulin resistance.",
