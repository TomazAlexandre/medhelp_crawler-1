    "question": "Had a cataract removed today. At the same time I was informed by one of the nurses that I had diabtes. It rang up 8.5 which, according to my brother who has had diabetes for years, is not that serious. However, I am not one to ignore danger signals so, I will be looking into all the info regarding the problem. Every time my wife looks at me she shakes her head. She says that if there are any more diseases out there I should stay away from them. Having, prostate problems, arthritis, glaucoma, asthma, a herniated disc, trick knee, pinched nerve in my neck and now diabetes, she says that enough is enough and that I should leave some medical problems for others instead of hogging them all. I must say however, that in spite of all this, I am in pretty good shape considering the shape I'm in. I told her that I made an appointment to see a dermatologist and she said that I should look up some new problems in a health manual\u00a0\u00a0that the dermatologist may not know about. Actually, she is with me 100 percent on this because one of my sisters died recently from skin cancer. It's the old saying.\"Better safe than sorry.\" It doesn't do any harm to research and question medical authorities in regards to problems that have faced other members of family. This is something everyone should do. If there are problems regarding health in anyone's family it should be looked into. I just felt like venting somewhat and having done so will sign off for the night and remember, \"Keep the faith.\"",
