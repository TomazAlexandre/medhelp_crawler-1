            "answer": "Hello babs63That smell you are smelling are called keytons.\u00a0\u00a0Only certain people can smell this smell.\u00a0\u00a0I am one of them.\u00a0\u00a0And from the way you describe it, you are one too.\u00a0\u00a0Keytones are caused by diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If I were you I would go get checked out ASAP.Organic compounds that result when body fat is broken down for energy.Glucose is usually used by cells for energy. But, when there's no insulin to help it transport out of the blood and into the cells, the body has an \"energy crisis\" and starts to break down body fat into ketones as an alternative fuel source. This is called ketosis.High blood glucose levels (over 250 mg/dl) are one sign that the body may have high levels of ketones circulating in the blood. This can progress to a serious complication called diabetic ketoacidosis. Testing the urine is one way to check for ketones. You can pick up urine test strips at your local drug store.\u00a0\u00a0Just follow the instruction to do the test.\u00a0\u00a0If I remember right if the test strip turnes pick you have ketones in your urine, plus the strip tells you if there is blood, glucose, and a couple other things.\u00a0\u00a0But If I were you I would go get checked out just incase.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps.",

I understand that diabetes is under control\u2014was a gylcosylated hemoglobin done to check the over all control?The second possibility is menopause. Get FSH, LH, estrogen and progesterone levels checked. If found in menopausal age group, then hormone replacement therapy will help take care of the odor. Take care!",
