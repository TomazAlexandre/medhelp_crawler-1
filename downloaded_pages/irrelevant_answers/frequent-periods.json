    "question": "I am almost 54 years old and still having one to two periods a month lasting 5 to 7 days each! Drs did tests that can predict possible onset of menopause, and it came back negative! I am not overweight. I have type 1 diabetes and wear an insulin pump but blood sugars are not well controlled. Drs do not think this is a cause for multiple periods either! Help! I hate not knowing when I may have a start up! The periods screw up my sugars so badly! Any ideas what can cause this? I have always been pretty regular! Ugh!!!",
