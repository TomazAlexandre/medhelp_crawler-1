            "answer": "From what I've read, it is more common in first pregnancies than in subsequent pregnancies.\u00a0\u00a0But you may have some unspoken underlying issues, such as lifestyle, weight, chronic high BP, or a family history of high BP, that may pre-dispose you to experiencing pre-eclampsia in future pregnancies.\u00a0\u00a0When you say your internal med. Dr. said to avoid it at all costs, was he referring to pregnancy?\u00a0\u00a0Because pre-eclampsia should not usually be a reason for not becoming pregnant again.\u00a0\u00a0It is controllable with regular pre-natal care, proper diet, and in rare cases, medication.\u00a0\u00a0So I would discuss that with your OB before deciding not to have more children based on having had pre-eclampsia during your first pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I have pre-eclampsia each and every pregnancy, this is my 4th.\u00a0\u00a0I control mine with meds because I have chronic High BP.\u00a0\u00a0Other than that, my pregnancies are fairly uneventful.Regards,Shelly",
