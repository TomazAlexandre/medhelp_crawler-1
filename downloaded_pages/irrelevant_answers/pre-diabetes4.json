            "answer": "Hi,given what you are describing you need additional testing.\u00a0\u00a0In particular, I would recommend thorough thyroid screening, which should include TSH, FT3 and FT4, and antibodies.\u00a0\u00a0There is also an excellent and very active thyroid forum on medhelp to ask more questions there.For the prediabetes.\u00a0\u00a0the fasting level of 116 is definitely high.\u00a0\u00a0However, a single test does not make the diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0 For diabetes you need to get a Hba1c test done.\u00a0\u00a0This test will tell you average blood sugar over the past 3 month.You could also try low carb eating to help reduce blood sugars.Please do go get thyroid properly looked into.\u00a0\u00a0I strongly feel this may be part of the issue. Low thyroid can cause many of the things you are complaining about...Given how unwell you are now, I would push to see a Dr already and try to get testing done.",

            "answer": "You can also get a blood sugar meter (I think wallmart has a reasonable cheap one.\u00a0\u00a0Relion brand, if I am correct.\u00a0\u00a0Though I don't live in states so can't be sure).\u00a0\u00a0YOu can test your fasting blood sugar and also sugar levels 2 hours after eating.\u00a0\u00a0This can both guide you in what your blood sugar is doing and also help you to control your diet appropriately to see what you can and can't eat in terms of sugar target.Normal fasting is typically in the 70 - 95 range, and post eating levels in non-diabetic persons are always less than 120.You should be tested also for vitamin D and iron levels.\u00a0\u00a0Anaemia\u00a0\u00a0could also cause the nerve symptoms\u00a0\u00a0you are experiencing.Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Please do come back and let us know how you are doing.",

    "question": "I am a 55-year-old woman disabled with a chronic pain disorder. I have an extensive family history of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. I was also diagnosed with Raynaud's Disease at 12, and have a very small bladder; so several of the symptoms for me can be easily explained away. Also, I never had a weight problem until menopause.Recently, I began gaining weight. So far I've put on 50 lbs in the past 4 months. My blood pressure has been extremely high since August 2015, along with an arrythmia, but the most alarming symptom was foot pain and burning, getting worse at night. I have decent pedal pulse, but I can't elevate or cross my levels without total numbness, my ankles and and feet are very swollen with pitting edema, and I've noticed that my calves are sometimes cooler than my feet, which are smooth, clean, heal well, but for the first time in my life have an odor.When I was finally able to get an appointment with a new primary physician, he ordered bloods. My fasting blood glucose was 116. My cholesterol and triglycerides were very high, I had a high serum potassium level, and my BP was off the charts when I saw him. He prescribed a beta blocker, instructed me to monitor my BP (which has continued to run very high despite the meds. As a former nurse, I know that beta blockers are more effective for arrythmias than for controlling hypertension, but due to my cluster headaches I can't take calcium blockers), and prescribed an anticholesterol drug. He also sent me for a doppler of my calves, but I haven't received the results yet, and he told me to monitor my glucose levels, except I haven't received the meter and supplies I ordered online.So here's my question: A) Do you think I'm correct in thinking that, based on one FBS, calling me \"borderline\" isn't very likely considering my multiple positive signs and symptoms, and especially because how could I have complications of a disease without actually having the disease? And B) Because I'm currently living in rural Texas (tho hopefully not for long), where actually seeing a doctor is difficult even with insurance, the doctors aren't close to what I'm used to in New York, and they're all on staff at the same small hospital with offices in the same place, how aggressive should I be to get seen by an endocrinologist, at the risk of seriously pissing everyone off? I'm the farthest thing from the standard ultra-polite, passive southern patient as it is. I usually don't have a problem being in charge of my healthcare, but I've learned the hard way, especially as a chronic pain patient, that sometimes it's necessary to tread carefully.Thank you for your input.",
