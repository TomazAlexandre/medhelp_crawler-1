    "question": "I have had a significant myopic shift since my last eye exam 4 months ago. I have Myasthenia Gravis, Sjogren's and CVID. I have been on oral steroids for 3 1/2 years. So, I also have Cushing's, insulin dependent diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, metabolic syndrome, etc. I also take Imuran, IV Gammaglobulin and IV Rituxan infusions. So, I am immunocompromised. My right eye shift has gone from -4.5 to -8.5 in just 4 months. But, my left eye has had no change. My optometrist is stumped. Eye exam is essentially normal. I do have a mild cataract. But,\u00a0\u00a0she doesn't think it is causing such a significant shift. Any idea what might be the problem?",
