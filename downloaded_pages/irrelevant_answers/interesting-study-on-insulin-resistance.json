            "answer": "I am a type 2 diabetic that SVRrd. Although I had a slow response during the first treatment, the second time I cleared relatively early, and went on to achieve sustained viral response. I think part of the misunderstanding here is that some members on this board have become obsessed by insulin resistance, and look at it as if it were a panacea to HCV treatment; but it doesn\u2019t *preclude* SVR; it\u2019s only another hurdle to jump on the path. I\u2019m not suggesting it be ignored either; but a balance needs to be found.Type 1 diabetes typically involves underproduction of insulin from the beta cells in the pancreas. Type 2, on the other hand, can be a combination of factors; underproduction of insulin, coupled with insulin resistance that prevents cells from absorbing or utilizing the insulin that *is* produced. A type 1diabetic typically requires very little exogenous insulin; they can get by with injecting small amounts. I, on the other hand, at times require very large amounts of insulin because my body is unable to \u2018accept\u2019 either my own insulin (endogenous), or the insulin we inject (exogenous). It\u2019s common for type 2 diabetics such as myself to require both oral insulin sensitizers (metformin) as well as insulin injections to maintain firm blood sugar control.Take care\u2014Bill",

The fasting glucose is commonly a part of a normal HealthScreen but really don't see why a doc would refuse a serum insulin test if requested, mine didn't even though my fasting glucose values were normal.Beyond that, study up as much as you feel comfortable with, and discuss with your medical team where relevant. Diet and exercise are the first line defense for IR but they may not work in all cases.With tests in hand (and perhaps some supplied studies) hopefully your medical team can put your IR status in a clinical context and come up with a plan where needed. And again, if you're not seeing a hepatolgoist, I highly recommend you switch over to one if feasible. They tend to be more on top of HCV and related topics and would be best to help pull your HCV strategy together.-- Jim",

Aims (1) To assess the association of diabetes mellitus (DM) in HCV patients to the severity of hepatic fibrosis and to the response to antiviral treatment. (2) To assess the safety of pegylated interferon and ribavirin combination therapy (Peg IFN/RBV) in diabetic HCV patients. Methods HCV diabetics (n = 61) were identified. A 2:1 matching control group was used to identify independent factors of advanced fibrosis and treatment failure. Results Compared to HCV non-diabetics, HCV diabetics were more likely to have steatosis (P < 0.0001) and advanced fibrosis (P = 0.003). Patients' age, Caucasian ethnicity, obesity, and histologic activity index were independently associated with advanced fibrosis (P < 0.05). Only 23% of HCV diabetics achieved SVR compared to 46% of HCV non-diabetics (P = 0.003). DM, genotype 1, high baseline viral load, and African-American ethnicity were independently associated with less SVR (P < 0.05). Significant adverse events were more common in HCV diabetics compared to HCV non-diabetics (P = 0.001). Side effects did not increase in patients receiving PEG IFN/RBV and insulin sensitizers. Conclusion DM was associated with impaired virologic response to PEG IFN/RBV in HCV patients. Adverse events during therapy were more frequent in diabetic compared to non-diabetic HCV patients.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19148751?ordinalpos=19&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum",

Hepatic steatosis is also 2.5 fold more frequent in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients as compared to the general population. Metabolic factors play a crucial role in the etiology of hepatic steatosis genotype non-3 related, which are also the genotypes with a greater association to IR. However, genotype 3, and particularly 3a, has a greater direct steatogenic capacity, and consequently, in those patients, the association with metabolic factors is weaker. Instead, in genotype 3, steatosis associates with viral factors like viral load. Those metabolic factors influence not only the natural history of HCV infection, as well as associate to an accelerated hepatic fibrosis progression, to a worse prognosis when hepatic cirrhosis is present, namely an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, and to a lower sustained viral response rate. On the other hand, in patients who achieve viral eradication, IR and hepatic steatosis may regress, and return if viral infection recurs, which onceagain indicates an intrinsic steatosis and IR promoter action by HCV.For the full text (9 pages) see...http://www.medigraphic.com/pdfs/hepato/ah-2009/ahs091k.pdf",

    "question": "J Hepatol. 2009 Apr;50(4):712-718.Insulin resistance predicts response to peginterferon-alpha/ribavirin combination therapy in chronic hepatitis C patients.Dai CY, Huang JF, Hsieh MY, Hou NJ, Lin ZY, Chen SC, Hsieh MY, Wang LY, Chang WY, Chuang WL, Yu ML.Hepatobiliary Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, No. 100, Tzyou 1st Rd, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan; Faculty of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Insulin resistance (IR) might be associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This study aimed to elucidate impact of IR and beta-cell function on the response to peginterferon-alpha (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin combination therapy in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients.METHODS: Three hundred and thirty patients without overt diabetes were treated with combination therapy with (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin for 24 weeks. The IR and beta-cell function were evaluated by homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) and homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-beta) before treatment.RESULTS: HCV genotype, pretreatment HCV RNA level and pretreatment HOMA-IR, but not HOMA-beta, were independent factors associated with sustained virologic response (SVR). In 150 patients with genotype 1b infection, pretreatment HCV RNA level, HOMA-IR and age were independent predictors for SVR. The significantly lower SVR rate in high HOMA-IR patients was observed in 76 patients with high HCV RNA levels (400,000IU/mL) who were defined as 'difficult-to-treat' patients. The mean HOMA-IR of 'difficult-to-treat' patients was significantly lower in 42 sustained responders than in 34 non-responders.CONCLUSIONS: IR was associated with SVR to (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin therapy for CHC, especially among 'difficult-to-treat' patients. These findings suggested clinical application of pretreatment HOMA-IR could enable treatment outcome to be predicted and treatment regimens to be determined.",
