            "answer": "Hi!What you probably have is palpitations-- an abnormal awareness of the beating of the heart. Palpitations may be normally felt if you are overexerted. Chemicals like adrenaline, alcohol, caffeine, cocaine, amphetamines, and other drugs all cause palpitations. Disease (such as hyperthyroidism and pheochromocytoma) or mitral stenosis, panic disorder all cause this. Palpitations may be associated with heart problems, anemias, low blood sugar and low blood pressure. If you have cough and are taking medicines that contain asthalin or terbutaline then the palpitations can be a side effect of the drugs.So if drink coffee or aerated drinks, then cut down on that. You have undergone some tests. Please go through the causes listed above and see what you have not been tested for.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",

    "question": "I'm a 17 year old female, not really active in sports or anything of that nature. Recently I have been having these episodes where my heart races to where it is hard to count my pulse, and I get lightheaded and nauseous. I went to the hospital last night because that was the first time it has happened 3 times in one day... they ran a CAT scan, Chest X-ray, blood tests, and everything came back negative. I had been laying down for over an hour when my pulse jumped to 130...this usually happens when i'm just sitting down doing nothing. I don't know if this is just a coincidence, but it happens mostly after I eat. A relative of mine said it could possibly be diabetes, but who knows. Help?",
