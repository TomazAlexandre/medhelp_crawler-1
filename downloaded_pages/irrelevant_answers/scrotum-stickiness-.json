            "answer": "Hello,I may be able to confirm the exact treatment and management of your condition only after knowing your complete medical history and clinical examination. Sweating can make loss of excess oils to the skin surface. It is possible that excessive sweating can cause skin problems and probably you are suffering from a chronic fungal infection of the scrotal skin called Tinea Cruris. If you are overweight lose weight. Excess fat causes sweating and oilier skin. Have you tried topical medications like nystatin, mild steroids? Oral therapy may be necessary if the skin infection is intractable. Repeated fungal infection can be an indication of an underlying disorder such as diabetes or any other condition which might be affecting your immune system Since your problem has been persisting so long your skin scrapings should be examined to clarify the diagnosis.A complete clinical examination and tests like urine examination, blood counts and fasting blood sugars may be helpful. Consult an experienced dermatologist. Treatment will be specific based on the cause. Keep me posted on how you are doing.Best luck and regards!",
