            "answer": "Going through it right now. Same as you, except this is my 4th pregnancy. Did not have this in my previous 3 pregnancies.. Not overweight... eat sensibly... BOOM! Diabetes..ugghhh.. I'm now 33 (almost 34) weeks.. been checking blood sugars 4x a day now for a month.. Not fun, but it gets easier to navigate what to (and not to) eat. The hardest part is saying no to cravings (like ice cream). Can't wait to eat what I want, when I want again, LOL",

            "answer": "Same here as you two girls. I already had a very restricted diet because I have severe gallbladder disease. I can't eat any fat of any kind, beef, pork, dairy, salas or greens. Now with gestational diabetes I can't have sugar and limit carbs. The baby is already under weight according to last 2 growth scans. I have only lost weight in pregnancy. I can't wait tell I have baby and 4 weeks after that to have gallbladder removed.I miss real foods. I drink mostly smoothies. I really miss a Burger which is funny because I never really ate them before I got pregnant. I have a hard time controlling my blood sugar. It is always around 167 an hour after I eat.Does your fingers hurt? Do you guys get symptoms with your diabetes like headaches, shaking, confusion?",

            "answer": "I was in denial for the first week. I've since determined on my own that I do, indeed, have gd. I don't know how you gals were instructed to test, but I'm suppose to test 4 times a day. Once in the morning before I eat, and then two hours after I eat breakfast, lunch, and supper. Blood sugars should be between 70-120. Fasting levels (the first test of the morning) should be no higher than 95 (some doctors don't want above 90). If I don't restrict my diet, I'm always over. So, yep.. I do have it.Now, one more question. Where are you poking your fingers? Mine are not sore, and I've poked 4x a day for the last month. I was instructed to poke on the side of my finger tip (I hope that makes sense). But not on the actual tip. That would hurt. Hope you ladies are doing well..",

            "answer": "I had it last pregnancy with my son. Not sure with this one bc I'm only 8 weeks and 3 days. It wasn't bad I just started watching carbs and sweets. If u had a craving for sweets I substituted it with sugar free. Sf isn't as bad as u would think. I loved the sugar free ice cream just be careful bc it gives you really painfull gas! But it was worth it to have my ice cream.",
