    "question": "I've been taking Wellbutrin 150mg XL once a day for over 2 weeks and while I'm fine in the morning, the depression sinks in later in the afternoon and all I want to do is eat cake, ice cream, sugary junk foods, and sleep. Why isn't the Wellbutrin keeping me \"up\" all day?Is craving sugary foods suggestive of serotonine deficiency?\u00a0\u00a0After I eat them I immediately get a jolt of energy and keep going but the problem is that I always overeat and already gained 10lb.How do I stop this?\u00a0\u00a0Take the Wellbutrin twice/day or something else in the afternoon?Any ideas are welcomed.Thanks!",
