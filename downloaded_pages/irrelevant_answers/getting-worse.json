            "answer": "Hi and welcome,I'm sorry there has been such a delay in getting a response to your post but it's often gets very quiet over the weekend and sometimes posts can get missed, sorry.I don't actually think it's 'likely' to be related to a neurological condition like MS though, white matter disease doesn't really give us anything to go by. White matter lesions are not actually uncommon, often ischemic vascular lesions are silent and don't cause symptoms but they are basically associated with many (non MS) medical conditions eg Migraine, hypertension, diabetes etc etc.The issues you mention actually sound to me, like they 'could possibly' be related to structural degenerative issues (spinal, pelvic etc), generated from your life time of mobility issues (born with club feet and Cerebral palsy) and I would recommend discussing the worsening your experiencing, with either your neuro surgeon again or getting a second opinion.Cheers.........JJ",

            "answer": "Hi Handy -You don't mention if your pain is all over or confined to a specific spot, like your left foot or right arm. Many of us with MS do experience pain, but it is usually confined to one spot. For me it's my left foot. Pain is generally a secondary MS symptom, rather than a first, or presenting, symptom.Your bowel and bladder issues are aalso common among MS folks. I think that these, combined with your foot bladder and bowel issues and \"white matter disease\" are certainly worth discussing with a neurologist, rather than a neuro surgeon.Kyle",

    "question": "Hi Every one I was born with club feet and Cerebral palsy,\u00a0\u00a0I am now 52 and over the last 5 years I had lots of operations on my legs to keep me walking, but I am noticing that the more I do the less I can do the pain is overwhelming I cant turn over in bed and then when I get up to walk I can barely get across the room I don't think this has anything to do with my ops, I am also having trouble with my bowl and bladder control, I had a brain scan and it showed white brain matter disease, but the nero surgeon said come back in 18 months to see if it has got any worse. Has any one else had this with MS or is total unrelated ?",
