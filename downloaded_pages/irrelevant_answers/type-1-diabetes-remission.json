            "answer": "I'm sorry, but no, there is no such thing as recovering from Type 1 diabetes. Not until they discover a cure anyway. But our insulin needs do vary and we need to make adjustments in doses when they do. I don't know as much about children, but I think their needs vary even more as they grow. I'm a little confused about your insulin usage. What is Novalin? Is that Regular? If so that is an old-fashioned type of long-acting insulin which I heard is very unsteady. Or is it a mix? You would do much better having her on the newer insulins: Long acting: Lantus or Levemir and short acting: Humalog, Novalog or Apidra. They are much more steady and easy to manage.Do you see a pediatric endo? If so, you should make an appointment and talk with him about her doses and getting on a more updated regimen. If you are seeing a regular doctor I would strongly encourage a pediatric endo. Also send me a PM if you want the name of a website with a lot more type 1's and parents that you can talk with.",

    "question": "My daughter was diagnosised with Type 1 Diabetes Aug 2008.\u00a0\u00a0We have learned how to inject insulin and check her blood sugar numbers.\u00a0\u00a0We keep her on a pretty strick diet to ensure that we keep her Blood Sugar Numbers between 80-180.\u00a0\u00a0The past two days she has been very low.\u00a0\u00a0We have tried to make sure that the insulin that we give her is only enough to cover the food that she has eaten.However, just today, she woke up with her blood sugar #s at 64.\u00a0\u00a0She ate about 32 carbs for breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0Because she was low on waking, I didn't give her any fast acting insulin.\u00a0\u00a0I gave her 7 units of Novolin at 9:30am about a half hour after she ate her 32 carb breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0At 10:15am she was hungry and ate 20carbs for snack.\u00a0\u00a0At 11:30am she said she felt tired.\u00a0\u00a0We checked her numbers.\u00a0\u00a0Blood Sugar was 33.\u00a0\u00a0She drank a 22carb juicebox, ate 3 pancakes with syrup - 88.5carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Total carbs 110.5.\u00a0\u00a0I checked her blood sugar again at Noon.\u00a0\u00a0She was 85.\u00a0\u00a0She said she still was hungry, and she ate a 20carb snack.\u00a0\u00a0I checked her numbers again just now at 12:30pm and she was 85.Could her body be producing insulin?\u00a0\u00a0Could she be on her way to recovery??\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone ever heard of someone being diagnosised and then recovering?I am lost...I don't understand why her numbers are so low...especially since the long acting insulin should one have started to work slowly at around 11:15am -- and she ate such a hearty breakfast and a large snack...her numbers should have shot high not down to a 33!Does anyone have any thoughts in regards to this?Thanks :)",
