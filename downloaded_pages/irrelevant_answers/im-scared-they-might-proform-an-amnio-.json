            "answer": "It really depends on circumstances. I am having a amnio because I am delivering my DD 3wks early. It is going to check and make sure her lungs are developed enough. Most women don't have amnio's unless they want them, are over 35, or have a history of Down syndrome or some other chromosonal issue in their family, or of course like me you deliver early.",

            "answer": "i am having twins and there was never a mention of amnio until i developed gestational diabetes and the possibility of me needing to deliver early became very real. if i have it done it will be for lung maturity.it's not routine just because you are having twins, but you do run a higher risk of developing complications that may make it needed.",

    "question": "hey ladies, how are ya doing? I have a question it might sound dumb but I'm gonna go ahead and ask the question. I am 23yrs old and I am pregnant with twins..... what are the chances that they may perform an amnio on me. last week when I went to see the perinatologist I over heard that a woman that is expecting twins was getting an amnio. I don't know if she had a reason or if they were just performing one because she's expecting twins. I'm just a little concern and scared so.........please ladies give me some advice to ease my nerves . thank you in advance",
