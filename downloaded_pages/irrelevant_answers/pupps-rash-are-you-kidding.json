Now i think i seriously have the pupps rash. not an extreme case thank god.; but its on\u00a0\u00a0my belly and my chest and my arm and lower foot. im so damn miserable..and up all night. ive ignored scratching entirely now on my belly. i did scratch a bit at first before i figured out what it was..but then stopped. i thought it was this new gold bond detergent i was using..n when i stopped...it looked like it was going away. NOPE now its on my entire chest area..and part of my left arm..and lower foot. and belly. so much for wearing a cute pregnancy swimsuit or tank tops. Im so damn miserable. baby oil baths help for the time im in tub thats it. NOTHING relieves it. none of my pregnant friends have it. just me. im so damn miserable",
