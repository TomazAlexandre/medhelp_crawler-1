But I do know that it is not HIV because I already got tested. I can also tell you that what is causing your problems is probably not HIV.",

    "question": "I've been having fatigue for the last 4 months with occasional painful lymph nodes that comes and goes. The lymph nodes only appear one at a time and mainly under my right armpit. I also have this disturbing pain on my right wing area when you press against it. My eyes are red almost all day and when I wake up in the morning I still feel tired as if i never slept. You can easily look into my eyes and see that I am ill.Talked to doctor and she told me i could be suffering from Sinus infection so she prescribed me antibiotics. took them and it did absolutley nothing...........I also took a blood test and the results were fantastic, i tested for mono and it came back negative. Only thing i did not test for was HIV. Doc told me that my CBC even though was not HIV would have still indicated if I was infected so she told me not to worry since my blood counts were really good showing very healthy.My last sexual exposure was in November of 2006, other than that I have just been with my Girlfriend and she is fine. She tested negative and we continue to have unprotected sex. If I was positive wouldnt she be having problems aswell??? And Does a GREAT CBC indicate a strong showing of HIV negative??? And what could be my problems??I never had a FEVERI am not losing weightI do not have any respitory problemsI tested for Diabetes it came back negative (Sugar counts were good)tested for anemia and it came back negativeI had a chest x-ray and it showed nothingI am worried sick, i feel like im dying..........someone please give me some advice and tell me what could be my problem.",
