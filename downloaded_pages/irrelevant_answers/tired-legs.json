            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!What you feel is probably pain and weakness of intermittent claudication where muscles spasm and then relax and then go into spasm again. It is commonly seen in patients with diabetes and hypertension.Another possibility is deep vein thrombosis. This can also cause pain due to poor blood supply to muscles. This can be known by dopplar studies.At times it can be due to a compressed spinal nerve in the lumbar area. This can be detected by nerve conduction studies and by MRI of the spine.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
