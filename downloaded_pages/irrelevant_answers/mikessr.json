            "answer": "Dr. Laquesta,Thank you vrey much for the reply.\u00a0\u00a0Her head pain situation has worsened as she had a spinal tap to identify possible causes of her current headaches and her spinal fluid is leaking out.\u00a0\u00a0That situation is being taken care of at the hospital by a \"blood patch\", but she is in extreme pain as of today.One non-medical person suggested trying a chiropractor also in the event this is a pinched nerve.\u00a0\u00a0Does that make sense?Following are specific answers to your questions.The headaches appeared suddenly? YESWere there any significant events or circumstances surrounding the onset? ( eg trauma, vigorous exercise, high level of stress at work or at home?) NOAny underlying conditions like hypertension, diabetes, vascular insufficiencies? NOAny lesions on the skin or scalp? NOAny associated fever, vomiting, dizziness, numbness, and other neurologic deficits NO FEVER, SOME NAUSEA AND DIZZINESS, SHE HAS A SENSITIVE AREA ON TOP OF HER HEAD THAT \"FEELS WET\" WHEN IT IS NOT.Does the pain keep her from doing her daily activities? ABSOLUTELY YES.\u00a0\u00a0SHE HAS BEEN FORCED TO SPEND A SIGNIFICANT TIME IN BED, PARTICULARLY AS HER HEAD PAIN INCREASES LATE AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING.The MRI and the lumbar tap did not show anything. ALL TEST RESULTS RECEIVED TO DATE ARE NEGATIVE, BUT THE RESULTS OF THE LUMBAR TAP ARE NOT IN YET.Has any of the physicians discussed with you a probable diagnosis?\u00a0\u00a0PINCHED NERVE IN THE NECK IS BEING INVESTIGATED BUT THIS IS REALLY A MYSTERY DISEASE AT THIS TIME.Any ophthalmologic examination done?\u00a0\u00a0NOTHANK YOU AGAIN VERY MUCH.\u00a0\u00a0ANY IDEAS ARE GREATLY APPRECIATED.\u00a0\u00a0THE TWO FINE PRIMARY PHYSICIANS (ONE MD SPECIALIZING IN SPORTS MEDICINE AND ONE A PLASTIC SURGEON SPECIALIZING IN HEAD TRAUMA) ARE RECEPTIVE TO ANY IDEAS.Mikessr",

            "answer": "Hi,This does sound like a baffling neurologic case.The symptoms of a severe headache associated with a sensation of wetness on top of the head may be nerve related given normal findings in all examinations.This sensation of \"wetness\" has to be elaborated.A complete mental status examination may also be extracted. Vascular insufficiencies also have to be excluded.Were any duplex scans done in blood vessels ( carotids for instance?).An assessment of heart function done as well as serum electrolytes( Calcium, sodium, potassium), Vi B6 levels?Ophthalmologic consult may also help determine any underlying eye involvement.The lumbar tap may be able to tell us something.The key may be is to be as thorough as possible. Medical history is important including a complete travel, occupational,menstrual and sexual history.Do keep us posted regarding her progress.",
