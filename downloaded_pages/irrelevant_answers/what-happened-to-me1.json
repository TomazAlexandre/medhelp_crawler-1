My husband has petit mal seizures and he shakes, gets sleepy but he can not remember anything that happens when he has one but they also only last a few minutes at a time. It may be a place to start checking. Best wishes, Sissie",

            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possible causes that may need to be considered include low blood sugar/ diabetes, cardiovascular causes such as arrhythmias, metabolic disorders, electrolyte abnormalities, vascular issues, hypotension, dehydration, medication side effect, psychological causes such as stress, hormonal/ endcorine issues etc. I would suggest getting this evaluated by an internist initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "The other day as I went to check on my daughter in the shower something really strange happened! I opened the curtin to check on her, as I closed the curtin I started to feel weird, like the feeling you get when your going to pass out. So I sat down on the toilet, the feeling then got worst! I could feel myself sweating everywhere, my head, arms, legs, everywhere! My other daughter came in and said, mom stop freakin me out, your freakin me out, stop staring and shaking! I told her its ok, Im ok, but it was like our conversation was in slow motion. I then started coughing and threw up a little bit. I told my daughter to go get my mom, still everything in slow motion! I could hear her telling my mom that I was in the bathroom staring and shaking and talking weird. After my mom came in and put cold rags on me, I started to feel a little better, but I was so tierd, like haven't slept in days tierd! Does anyone know what happened to me?",
