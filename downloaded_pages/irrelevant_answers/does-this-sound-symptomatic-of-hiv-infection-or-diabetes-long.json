    "question": "I am 29 and have had anxiety problems since I was around 19 years old. But in the last few years, I've had something to really worry about. Approximately 2-3 years ago, I had unprotected sex with a girl I knew from work. We were both drunk, there was a house party, and one thing led to another. Had I been sober, I would have never touched the chick because she had a reputation for being a ****. (Smart move, eh?) Anyhow, since then I've had some cause for concern, and I've thought about it quite a bit.I don't remember getting sick after we had sex, I very seldomly get sick. I have a frequent, recurring rash (scaly, flaky skin, really) that's on my groin area, just to each side of where my penis hangs down. It doesn't itch or burn whatsoever. I haven't had a rash anywhere else. I also haven't noticed any swelling of lymph nodes, except a couple days ago I noticed one near the edge of my armpit was a little swollen up, maybe the size of a pea, but it was literally an inch away from where I had been bitten by a tick. I have never been the most energetic person in the world, but I do feel as though I feel a little fatigue, or should I say grogginess/sleepiness... I don't feel physically exhausted but I do yawn all the time.There are a couple of weird symptoms that are stressing me out though. First and foremost, I definitely have a hairy tongue. I remember a couple years ago it seemed like I'd always have this filmy white gunk that I'd have to brush off of my gums every morning, and sometimes at before I went to bed. Now I don't have any of the filmy stuff on my teeth, but it seems like my gums have receded a little and I can see tiny clearish bumps on my upper gumline, right in front. Also, I definitely have the fuzzy tongue syndrome going on. At first it wasn't very bad but lately I have to scrub it throughly every morning. I must admit that I do smoke and drink alcohol, and everything I've read about candida says that's the worst thing you can do. I've looked at pictures of oral thrush, and what I have looks different. It's not all chunky and cottage cheese-looking, it's this greyish hairy looking gunk that builds up predominantly at the back of my tongue, but my whole tongue is more or less a pinkish gray all the time. I know my breath has definitely taken a turn for the worst too. I haven't noticed anything inside my cheeks or on the roof of my mouth, or in the back of my throat.Another disturbing symptom that I've noticed within the last year and a half to two years is that my undereyes are really dark. The whole area under, around and above my eye up to my eyebrows looks bloodshot, you can see the blood vessels and it's more pronounced on my eyelids. My hands and feet are always cold, and I often get pins-and-needles in both of my arms, but my left moreso. I have never noticed any strange sores or weird bruising, but I have \"floaters\" all the time, especially noticeable in bright sunlight. They look like connected dots that float across my vision.I had major problems with my prostate until just a few months ago. I was actually scared to death that I had prostate cancer because it felt like a golfball was shoved up my ***, and I'm still fairly young. It was also really hard to get to the point of orgasm when it was acting up like that. I took caprylic acid and organic oregano oil for a 2 months and I haven't felt any discomfort or weirdness in that region at all.. thank god. Another odd symptom that I've noticed is that the palms of my hands do not have a rash on them, but they often look mottled or spotty. It's not all the time, just sometimes. And on the tops of my hands and fingers, there's spots here and there that are whiter than the rest of my skin, they aren't raised or crusty or anything, just smooth. It seems like they are more visible when my hands and fingers are cold, or when my circulation is fairly low.Just in the last week I've started having strange headaches that only come on in the late afternoon and usually persist until I go to bed. They aren't major headaches, they're just barely annoying enough to remind you that it's there. And I'm not sure if I have a problem with my jaw or not, but I've been having strange sensations with my hearing, sometimes one ear at a time, sometimes together, but usually one ear at a time. It sounds/feels like changing elevation quickly. This might just be a product of me unconsciously clenching my jaw. (I do have a lot of anxiety)I should also mention that there was a period of time about a year and a half ago where I lost a lot of weight in a relatively short period of time, but at this point I went from going to the bars every night to not drinking at all, and I started working out a bit. I also didn't really eat much during that period because I was pretty broke. Since then I've packed quite a bit of the weight that I lost back on, which is annoying yet slightly optimistic if I'm thinking there's a chance I could be infected with HIV, right?I've researched a lot on the internet and read through countless submissions from other people, and from everything I've been dealing with, it seems like I'm looking at 3 options: hiv, cancer or diabetes.I feel sleepy and lethargic most of the time, my tongue is greyish and always furry looking, I have really shaky hands oftentimes (dunno if that's nerves or a diabetic symptom?), I get really sleepy after I eat, I have the rash on both sides of my thighs where my penis touches, I have eye floaters, small white spots on my hands, dark veiny eye area, prostate problems (which I think I cured), frequent loose stools (not really diarrhea but pretty close), cold hands and feet (and nose in the winter). It more or less feels like I have a sinus infection all the time, and looks like it too.I haven't had any strange unexplained acne outbreak, I also rarely get sick. The last time I was sick was last January, and before that it was at least a year or two since I had last been sick. I have an excellent appetite, never have a problem eating.What's bothering me is the fact that these symptoms aren't going away. My tongue has been embarassing for over a year now. Honestly I'm just extremely nervous because odds are SOMETHING is wrong with me, whether it's HIV, cancer or diabetes. I really hope it's not one of the first two, diabetes does make more sense because I have diabetic people on both sides of my family, but no men. Judging by everything I've given you, does it sound likely that I have HIV? Or do you think it's more likely I could have diabetes? One of the big symptoms I read about for diabetes is intense thirst... but these days I have basically ZERO thirst. I almost have to remind myself to drink water, otherwise I just won't think about it. But about a year ago there was a few months where I felt like I could never possibly drink enough water. I was peeing constantly from the ridiculous amount of water I was drinking.I am going to go get checked out soon and get my fears either laid to rest or defined. I know it seems weird, but honestly I just hope it's ANYTHING but HIV. I don't mean that to sound bad to anyone who has it, but I think you probably know what I mean. I appreciate anyone that takes the time to reply to this long-winded rant!",
