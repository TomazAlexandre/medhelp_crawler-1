            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Low grade fever is generally due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroid states, overwork, stress and fatigue. It is also seen in diseases like tuberculosis. Anemia and diabetes can raise the heart rate too.If your stomach too feels queasy, there is a chance that you have inflammation of the bowels as seen in IBS, colitis or maybe even gluten or lactose intolerance. All these can raise heart rate and cause low grade fever. Discuss this with your doctor and try and get investigated.Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
