            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The swelling above the knee could be a hematoma, bursitis, arthritis, or muscle injury or due to deep vein thrombosis. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. An X-ray or CT scan can tell for sure what swelling is. Your mother would need to consult an orthopedic specialist. There is no way she can treat this at home. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
