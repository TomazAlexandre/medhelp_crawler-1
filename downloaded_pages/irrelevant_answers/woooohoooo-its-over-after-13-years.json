            "answer": "Why can't you bring yourself to go?You do realize there is no cure for addiction, right? You also realize there are other diseases with no cures, right? Let's use diabetes for example. There is no cure and if it's not treated you will die. Addiction is the same way. If it's not treated you will also die. Diabetes can be controlled by the use of insulin and your life can go back to the way it was before becoming diabetic. Sure, it can seem like a hassle to always having to check your blood sugar and administering insulin when needed but you know if you don't do it you won't last long. The only thing that can keep an addict from living a short life is aftercare. It's no cure but it will save our lives. Sure, meetings can be an\u00a0\u00a0inconvenience at times but it's what we have to do if we don't want to die. There's no cure for addiction but we can put it into remission. If you had diabetes would you refuse to treat it? Heck no! So why are you having problems wanting to treat your addiction? Until you realize that it must be treated with meetings, therapist, ect. you will more than likely continue to use.Getting through the physical part of withdrawals is the easy part. Any addict with any decent amount of clean time will tell you this. It's the mental aspect following the physical part that always gets us unless we work on our recovery. The fight isn't over once we make it through the first week or two. The real fight is only beginning.Congrats Decadelong on your clean time!! I'm glad you finally figured it out! You story is proof that we can't do this on our own. Way to go!!",

            "answer": "my3kids, I don't know where you heard that you have to walk into a meeting and tell your story, but that is not how it works. It is not a place where people sit and talk about what they did while they were using. It is a place where people sit and talk about recovery. You don't have to speak if you don't want to. You can sit and simply listen until you feel comfortable.There is nothing to fear. It is a group of people, just like yourself, who are working on themselves and finding ways to live life without the use of drugs. They are no different from you---no better, no worse.You owe it to yourself to give it a try. Here is the link where you can find meetings in your area. Best of luck and let us know how you make out.http://portaltools.na.org/portaltools/MeetingLoc/",
