            "answer": "Thanks for your feedback.The reason why I asked here is, I am not on good terms with his cardiac doctor, who is rather temperamental. He is known to be a great surgeon, but not very attentive to patient. My dad likes him because he is famous, but I don't because I think he is rather arrogant and perhaps misses out on some of the obvious symptoms, because he is also incredibly busy, sometimes skipping appointments with my dad when he cannot manage. My dad is also quite timid, so he will never raise objection with his doctor.",

            "answer": "does the famous doctor think to hire a PA?\u00a0\u00a0They are also a wealth of info.\u00a0\u00a0No matter how famous he is by the way, he is working FOR you.\u00a0\u00a0I mean, if the patients did not pay for his work, he would be looking for another line of work.\u00a0\u00a0They tend to forget the root of any and all success is the patient themselves.",

    "question": "My dad is 82 years old, had a heart attack in his 60s, also has had diabetes for over 10 years.Currently he cannot lay flat on bed and requires oxygen at night. His pulse rate is very low (40s), and yet pulse pressure is quite high (150/60). His blood sugar is also going constantly above 200mg after meals.His doctor has not prescribed a diagnosis of congestive heart failure, but when I look on the web, it seems that he is showing classic left-ventricular failure symptoms (except for coughing). Should I bring him to another heart doctor for a second opinion?If left untreated, how dangerous will the situation be?",
