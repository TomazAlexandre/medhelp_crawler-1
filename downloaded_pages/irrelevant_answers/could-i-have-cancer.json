            "answer": "I'm not sure about cancer, but the fact that it has a foul odor does indicate that you may have an infection. Did you get any results on the cultures yet? I guess it could be a bladder infection, but it seems like it would have something to do with your reproductive system, since you're actually bleeding (not just blood in urine). But either way, you're on antibiotics, so it might take care of the infection...no matter where it is. However, if you still have symptoms after you finish the antibiotics, I would defintely ask to have some more tests done.",

    "question": "Hi, I am 38 years old, for the past 2 years I have had heavy bleeding and have put up with it, because when I saw the GYN almost 2 years ago she said she thought it was from uncontrolled diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Well not only am I bleeding heavy but over the last 2 months I have bled boil pus looking blood between my period and have had constant to severe pain right above my pubic bone, I also have had a continuel low grade fever (99.4-99.6). Now I have a foul odor, pain and brownish discharge.\u00a0\u00a0I recently saw a doctor who thinks it may be a bladder infection and I am being treated for it, she did take a pap smear and some cultures.\u00a0\u00a0My mom died of breast cancer in her 40's and my grandma died of ovarian cancer in her 40's.\u00a0\u00a0Should I be worried or could this just be a simple infection.\u00a0\u00a0If after the antibotics I am still having the symptoms should I put up a big stink or let it go like the bleeding???",
