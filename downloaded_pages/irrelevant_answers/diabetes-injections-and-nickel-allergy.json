            "answer": "Furthermore, if you try this and hives continue, then you might want to ask his doctor to look at possible insulin allergies. I have heard from some type 1 folks who get hives at injection sites because of allergies to one brand of insulin (or rather whatever that insulin is suspended in), and when they switch to another similar type of insulin, the hive problems go away. Just a thought. Maybe you should keep this in the back of your mind in case the nickel is not the real problem, but perhaps one of the insulins he takes. Maybe he should try the I-Port first, and if that doesn't help, then perhaps look at trying some different brands of similar insulins.YOu received some very good advice from JDRF-VOL-RL, in my humble opinion. I wish you and your son the best.",

    "question": "My 13yo son Sean was diagnosed with Type 1 nine months ago.\u00a0\u00a0We have known for years that he has a severe nickel allergy, and reacts to even the minute amounts of nickel in stainless steel and even some sterling silvers.\u00a0\u00a0He has reacted to jeans snaps, orthodontic wire, watches, and even to a surgical pin placed in a broken finger.Now he is reacting to the nickel in the stainless steel of his insulin needles, and is developing hives at his injection sites.\u00a0\u00a0I have contacted several syringe manufacturers but have not been able to find any that make a nickel-free needle.\u00a0\u00a0 In fact, some needles are actually nickel-coated.An insulin pump is not an option for us.\u00a0\u00a0Our insurance will not pay for it, plus Sean takes karate 5x/week (not good to get kicked in an insulin pump, right?)He is already taking Claritin during the day and Benedryl at night, but the hives just get worse.Does anyone have any ideas that might help us?\u00a0\u00a0We are only nine months into a lifelong disease, and the allergic reacting is worsening.",
