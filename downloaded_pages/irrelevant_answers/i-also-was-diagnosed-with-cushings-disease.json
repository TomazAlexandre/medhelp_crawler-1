            "answer": "Janie001 - I am by no means a medical professional, just the wife of a juvenile diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I did a little research on my own and I too found more information on Cushing's Disease in dogs.\u00a0\u00a0I did, however, find some information on Cushing's syndrome on Mayoclinic.com that may be helpful to you.\u00a0\u00a0Below is an overview.\"Cushing's syndrome is a result of high levels of the hormone cortisol.\u00a0\u00a0This can occur when the adrenal glands make too much cortisol or more commonly, it can be the result of prolonged use of high doses of cortisol-like medications that are used as a treatment for various acute and chronic illnesses such as asthma and arthritis.Some signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome are a fatty hump between your shoulders, a rounded face, and pink or purple stretch marks on your skin.\u00a0\u00a0It can also result in high blood pressure, bone loss, and on occasion, diabetes.There are treatments for Cushing's syndrome designed to return your body's cortisol production to normal.\u00a0\u00a0By lowering your cortisol levels, you will experience noticeable improvements in your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0If left untreated, Cushing's syndrome can eventually lead to death.If the cause of Cushing's syndrome is long-term use of corticosteroid medications, your doctor may be able to keep your Cushing's symptoms under control by reducing the dosage of the drug over a period of time, while still adequately managing your condition. For many of these medical problems, your doctor can prescribe noncorticosteroid drugs, which will allow him or her to reduce the dosage or eliminate the use of corticosteroids altogether. However, don't reduce the dosage of these drugs or stop taking them on your own. Do so only under your physician's supervision. Abruptly discontinuing these medications could lead to failure of your adrenal glands.\"I hope this helps you to understand a little bit more about Cushing's syndrome and where it came from.\u00a0\u00a0There is additional information on the mayoclinic.com website that deals with the other causes and treatments of Cushing's syndrome.",
