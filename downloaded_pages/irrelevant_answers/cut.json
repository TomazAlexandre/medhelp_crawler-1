            "answer": "HiA wound that does not heal is due to some underlying cause like low blood supply (ischemia) or diabetes or low lying infection. \u201cpin-hole size blood blisters\u201d as described by you is probably granulation tissue that is formed while healing. A non healing wound has central red portion and peripheral white portion and pus or white tissue in between.Please get a blood glucose fasting and after food. If you smoke, then smoking too can cause peripheral blood vessels to constrict and the wound does not heal. A swab culture of the wound can detect any infection. If your work involves pressure on fingertips then the pressure too can cause the wound not to heal.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining and tests to confirm it. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted.",

            "answer": "thanks for your help. shortly after my post, i saw a doctor and he prescribed clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream USP. i've been applying it on nearly a daily basis for about a month but the problem still exists -- skin cracking at the tip of my right middle finger right near the nail. the cream looks like it just leaves the tip moist and raw, but within a few hours the cracking/dryness returns. the cracking results in mini paper-cut type of wounds that seem tiny but deep and cause a great deal of pain when pressure is applied to them. they often bleed and create pin-hole size blood blisters. any help you could give is much appreciated!!! thanks.",

    "question": "I've had a cut on the tip of my middle finger on the right hand for a few months. It's a small but deep cut that looks to be surrounded by some sort of calcium related dryness of the skin. It looks like it's inhabited by pin-hole size blood blisters as well. I experience a little bit of pain when there's no pressure on it, and lighting-sharp pain when pressure is accidentally aplied to it.\u00a0\u00a0Any diagnosis/tratments?",
