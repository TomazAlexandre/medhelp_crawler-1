            "answer": "Hi,I suppose that the most common reasons for developing raised creatinine levels will be when the filtration mechanism becomes gradually damaged by long-term hypertension or Diabetes. In any severe feverish illness where the person gets dehydrated, there may be a rise in blood creatinine levels as the kidney tries to deal with the breakdown products of proteins in our bodies. On its own, a single creatinine level does not really give us much useful information.For your twitching you can discuss the symptoms with neurologist and decide regarding further plan of management.Have you repeated your test? What does the report say?Do you have hypertension or diabetes? Have you checked for them?Hope this helps.Bye.",
