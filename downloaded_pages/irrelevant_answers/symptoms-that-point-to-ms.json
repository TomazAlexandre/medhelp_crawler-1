            "answer": "Hi,in my case, the pins and needles/tingling come first and then it turns to numbness, also have the altered skin sensation right down my left side (like touching a bruise) - I had lots of blood tests done too and apart from being slightly anaemic mine were all normal, it was only when my leg went my Dr referred me straight for an MRI scan which showed signs of MS but he also said it was difficult to diagnose and has referred me to a neurologist - seems like once the gates opened the symptons haven't stopped doesn't it?Good luck with your appointments x",

    "question": "I have numbness that started in my feet apprx 6 months ago. It is in both feet and has progressed quite significantly in the last few month. It has now moved up to my knees and I and starting to get the tingling and pins/needles in my buttocks in inner thiegh. I have had CT scan on my head and spine with nothing showing up. I have been tested for thyroid, diabetes, vitamin deficienties, and many other blood test all coming back negative. I can no longer feel my toes, top of my feet, and the bottom region of my calfs. However the sensation on my skin on th bottom of my feet is severe to the slightest touch like touching raw nerves. Both legs mimic each other so when I get tingling in on foot the same thing occurs in the same spot in the other. My short term memory is declining as quickly as the numbness. I have a MRI and neurologist appointment in 14 days but everything is pointing the the symptoms I read about re MS. Does this sound like a common start?? Everytime I mention MS to my MD I get silence as an answer and then more test run.",
