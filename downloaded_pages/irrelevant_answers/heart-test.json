            "answer": "From the limited information you have provided, could be ideopathic (cause unknown) coronary artery spasms could be the underlying cause.\u00a0\u00a0Arteries would appear normal during a stress test unless there is an event at the time of the test.The spasm often occurs in coronary arteries that have not become hardened due to plaque buildup (atherosclerosis). However, it also can occur in arteries with plaque buildup...your stress test indicates no occlusions. . The coronary artery may appear normal during angiography, but it does not FUNCTION normally.Coronary artery spasm affects approximately 4 out of 100,000 people. About 2% of patients with angina (chest pain) have coronary artery spasm.\u00a0\u00a0Cocaine use and cigarette smoking can cause severe spasm of the arteries, and can cause the heart to work harder. In many people, coronary artery spasm may occur without any other heart risk factors (such as smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol).Treatment of coronary artery spasms may include medications such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers and 1-arginine, which may reduce the risk of recurrence. You can also reduce your risk by discontinuing tobacco use and controlling high cholesterol and high blood pressure.",
