    "question": "My daughter is 3 1/2. She drinks constantly. Not just a small cup of milk or water, an adult size cup full. She can finish it in 2mins or less. She will do this 8-12cups a day with no problem. I am sure all of the drinking is part of it, but she urinates all the time. Complains at least 5-6x a week of bad belly pain...to the point where she is in tears. She sleeps all the time and has lost some weight. I am not sure if she is on the verge of another growth spurt or if its something to worry about. She has always been a laid back kid, but sometimes she is so blah, we can hardly get her moving. She is 37lbs and 40\" tall. She is also constantly hungry. Her uncle (my brother in law), maternal great grandmother (my grandmother) and cousin are all type I diabetics. My brother in law was diagnosed at the age of 9. He had a slow onset, not the sudden downfall. I work for a doctor and will run her urine this week just to make sure she isn't spilling sugars. She has a preschool physical on the 29th, but I thought I would ask some opinions on here. I hate to be the \"over reacting parent.\" Any advice is appreciated!",
