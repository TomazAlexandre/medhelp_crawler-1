            "answer": "Completely painless test where you sit with a monitor that records movement/contractions and another monitor that records the baby's heartbeat. They're looking for heartbeat acceleration with movement. And they want so many accelerations in a 20 minute time. This indicates that there is no problem with oxygenation to the baby and normal neurological development. I am over 40 so they did weekly NSTtests my last 3 wks. Good luck.",
