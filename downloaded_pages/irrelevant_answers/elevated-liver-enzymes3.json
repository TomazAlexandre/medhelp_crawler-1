            "answer": "Hello,Elevated liver enzymes are not pathognomic of fatty liver.It is found in host of other conditions also which I have already mentioned.If there is any elevation of the liver enzymes,it means that liver is involved directly or indirectly.For confirmation of fatty liver,biopsy of liver is the best diagnostic test. The biopsy can help determine whether fatty liver is present, whether it resulted from alcohol or certain other specific causes, and how severe the liver damage is.It is not compulsory that in fatty liver,the enzymes continue to rise as it may be associated with other liver abnormalities also. Fatty liver is simply accumulation of fats in liver.So basically it can be a predisposition to other liver pathologies.Hence,if you are having elevated liver enzymes,an extensive and thorough investigation for the liver pathology is needed.We can\u2019t blame fatty liver alone.A consultation with a hepatologist(liver specialist) will be the best.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
