    "question": "About a week ago I awoke with my left arm completely asleep and numb, must have been sleeping on it. The next day I noticed I had minor paraesthesia in my left hand. But only on two fingers and on certain parts. The two areas are the finger tip of my pinky finger there is no abnormal feelings below the top joint, only the tip. And my ring finger but not as severe in the same place the tip and same thing where there is no abnormal feelings below the top joint.All motor control and everything is working fine with two fingers far as I can tell, squishing the tips increases the feeling of paraesthesia, thou this has been going on for over a week by now. No change in sensation while moving the fingers either.Did I damage a nerve somewhere on my arm by having the blood supply being cut by sleeping on it?",
