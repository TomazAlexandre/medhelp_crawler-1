            "answer": "duplix,thanks for the post.By definition, the presence of coronary disease means you do not have a normal heart and ncreases your overall risk of a cardiac event even without PACs and PVCs. What you have to realize is what the actual risk is from though and guide your therapy and focus in those directions.In the absence of blockages that are leading to rhythm issues or any significant previous heart damage, your main risk of having a major cardiac complication comes from the risk of having progression of your coronary disease, such as with the rupture of a atherosclerotic plaque.\u00a0\u00a0Thus therapies designed specifically to prevent progression of your disease and decrease your overall risk of a myocardial infarction will have a significant impact on that risk.In certain subsets of patients with a prior history of coronary disease, such as those with a low ejection fraction, or very frequent ventricular ectopy the risk of sudden cardiac death is markedly increased and those specific patients may benefit from cardiac electrical therapy such as implantable defibrillators.I know it's hard not to focus on the extra beats, but I can't stress enough the importance of taking care of your overall health. An interesting study was performed in patients several years ago that tries to suppress PVCs in patients with CAD. Interestingly, by using arrhythmic medications, researchers were able to suppress the extra beats. However, the main side effect of the medications was to increase the risk of sudden cardiac death.\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the cure was worse than the disease.Hope this helps.good luck",

            "answer": "This is an excellent question and probably one that is worthy of alot of debate.My guess would be statistically speaking someone with known CAD might be at a slightly higher risk with PVCs , but another plus would be no heart damage from the CAD and that is was caught and preventative measures taken. My opinion only.",

Propranolol, from understanding and also experience has a more central calming effect than atenolol, atenolol is more cardioselective than propranolol, therefore that might the cause of the anxiety rebound, maybe your doctor might prescribe an anti anxiety medication short term to help you through the transition of medication.
