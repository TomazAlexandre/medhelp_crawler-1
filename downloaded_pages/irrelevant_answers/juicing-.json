            "answer": "Fruit jucing isn't good.\u00a0\u00a0Vegetable jucing is.\u00a0\u00a0 But not carrot juice.\u00a0\u00a0 Other veg juices are really good for you, because by mechanically breaking down the fibers of some vegetables, you get more nutrients out of them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Good juice veges:1. Kale2. Broccolli3. Spinach4. Kelp5. Celery6. Bok ChoiPretty much all the green ones are good for you to juice.",

            "answer": "Are you sure veg juicing is good?\u00a0\u00a0I'm open to learning more about this.\u00a0\u00a0I have not seen well researched peer reviewed material on this subject.\u00a0\u00a0How is removing fiber from veg good for you....or are we talking about different juicing methods?\u00a0\u00a0I'm thinking about the juicing machines that produce a juice liquid out one spout and loads of fibrous material (which is then discarded) in a separate container.From an ancestral diet point of view, I can see how juicing by removing pulp may be closer to what some ancestors experienced.\u00a0\u00a0Our modern agriculture has genetically made fruits and veg more plump and juicy.\u00a0\u00a0For example, ancient non modified mangoes are a hunk of fibrous material, which can only be consumed by chewing and sucking the fibrous pulp, then spitting the fibrous pulp out without eating it.\u00a0\u00a0In the end, you only suck the juice...no fiber.My added concern with juicing is the huge jolt of juice.\u00a0\u00a0In natural conditions, you can only consume a limited amount of veg, because the fibrous part acts as a natural limit.\u00a0\u00a0With juicing, there's almost no limit how many volumes of liquid a person can ingest.",

            "answer": "I'm talking about using something like a vita-mix.\u00a0\u00a0 It's juice, fibers, all.\u00a0\u00a0Not just the juice and the fiber is left behind.What vita-mix does is it just breaks down the fibers and plan cell wall to allow your body better access to the nutrients.Also, I don't just do the juice by it self.\u00a0\u00a0 I drink it with whey protein for breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, I add 2 tblspns of flax-seed oil.\u00a0\u00a0 To this I add lecithin.I took the recipe from a\u00a0\u00a0book by Dr. Ali on diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He has used this on his patients for 20+ years with good results.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm not expecting the \"miracles\" that he has in his book, but I figure if he's gotten great results on that many patients it's worth doing.In his books, he has OGGT tests of patients who have been under his care and following his protocol for 2 - 5\u00a0\u00a0years.\u00a0\u00a0 He shows that not only has he managed to keep their OGGT from getting worst,\u00a0\u00a0in many instances he's actually reverse the trend.\u00a0\u00a0 In most cases he's gotten people off medications and on just diet to control it.If nothing else, it's really helped with my energy and also my cholesterol has gotten much better.",
