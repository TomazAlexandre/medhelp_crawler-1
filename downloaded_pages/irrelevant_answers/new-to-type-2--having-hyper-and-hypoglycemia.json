            "answer": "If you are prediabetic or diabetic wide fluctuations in your blood sugar are not unusual. One of the first things (after diagnosis) is an attempt at lifestyle changes. This does not mean you have to top eating but change your eating habits to provide a more even blood sugar throughout the day. This will reduce your hypo-hyperglycemic episodes. A dietitian with diabetic experience can certainly help you in this area.",

    "question": "Dear All:I am a 50-year-old male, and am borderline obese (if you consider 5' 9\" and 215 obese). I have not yet been diagnosed as Type 2 diabetic, but lately my blood sugar levels have been moderately high when tested. It appears I am either pre-diabetic or already there. For example, a couple of evenings ago my glucose was 181 an hour after eating. I am not taking any diabetes medication. I am scheduled to have another fasting blood test later this week, which may result in a Type 2 diagnosis.Here's what I don't understand. Looking back over the last 20 years or so, I have had occasional instances of what I now know must have been hypoglycemia. When it happens I get shaky, sweaty, sometimes have a headache, and always an intense need to eat something NOW. When I do eat something, I feel better fairly quickly. Over the last year or so, it's been happening more often -- mostly if I go too long without a meal. Today, I had my usual non-sugared oatmeal for breakfast, a light lunch (bowl of soup), and some raisins and prunes between meals, Around 6pm I began feeling hypoglycemic, with a vertigo sensation (like the room was spinning). I tested my glucose and it was 74. I had a few handfuls of trail mix and around 15 minutes later I was at 100, but am still having vertigo. I had dinner a few minutes ago and while the earlier symptoms have largely subsided, the vertigo is still there.So my questions are...1. Why am I apparently having both hyper and hypoglycemia? Again, I am not on any diabetes meds.2. Can anyone shed any light on my experience today?Thank you very much!",
