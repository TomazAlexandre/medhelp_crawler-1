High triglycerides(I believe) does show up if you are diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Do you get headaches after eating certain foods?\u00a0\u00a0Or missing a meal or not eating on a 3 to 4 hour schedule. Have you found that your\u00a0\u00a0eyesight has changed recently? Blurry?\u00a0\u00a0Or you extremely thirsty & have to urinate more?\u00a0\u00a0Are you losing weight without trying?",

            "answer": "Well, I did have the glucose tolerance test done back in august. I am not diabetic because my fasting glucose in the morning was 74 and fasting insulin level was 11. But I did have impaired tolerance test results. Because 2 hours after drank the solution, my glucose was about 175. That's how they diagnose me with PCOS. But the thing I don't like is the motion sickness. Even though I am sitting on a chair I feel I am moving like on the elevator or something. If I stand too long, I feel I can't balance myself or about to fall.",

            "answer": "Hi, just reading this post reminded me of my own weird symptoms.Spent over 2 1/2 years dealing with endo, neuro and finally rheuamtologist. Finally got a dx of Fibromyalgia when I saw a different rheumatologist. He applied pressure to \"trigger points\" thought I was going to hit the ceiling. He then told me that it was common along with Hashi's Thyroiditis. I am due to see endo in a couple of weeks. Will be interested to hear her take on this. I have never had an ultrsaound of thyroid. Diagnosed through labs and physical exam. Wondering if I should ask her to do further tests.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis April 2006 and I have been on 75mcg synthoid since. I was also diagnosed with PCOS and I am currently taking 500mg Metformin and Omacor for cholestrol. My total cholestrol and my LDL are fine. The only thing is that I have low HDL and very high triglycerieds. My doctor contributed all the cholestrol problem to these two conditions I have. But despite being on meds, my triglycerides still very high. I searched on the internet, it said that other than thyroid, diabetes, or PCOS, liver disease and kidney disease could also cause this level to be high. But the blood test for liver and kidney function are all normal. I even did abdomen ultrasound and it came out normal. Since diagnosis, I have had other symptoms such as headache which usually is at back of my head or on top of my head. Also, I have some sort of like motion sickness with balance problem. Does anyone out there have the same symptoms as I do? The meds never made me feel good. The only thing it get rid of is my heart palp. Another thing, when you have thyroid problem, will it mess up with the CBC testing. My RBC, WBC, plalete, Hemoglobin, Hemotocrit, MCV, MCHC, always fluctuates with TSH level but still with in the normal range. Could anyone comment on this? I am about to see a neurologist about all my problems. Thanks.",
