            "answer": "Hello,Since there is no rash associated, so neurodermatitis is an important possibility. Neurodermatitis develops when nerve endings in the skin become irritated, triggering a severe itch-scratch-itch cycle. Common causes of nerve irritation include an insect bite and emotional stress. I suggest you to get an examination done from a dermatologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "I have the same burning, deep, nothing relieves it itching on both feet and hands at same time. It used to just be balls of my feet. I am not under undue stress and, there is no bug bite, inflammation,redness and doctors have even tried Valium (convinced after all tests negative) that it must be \"in my mind\"/stress or psychosomatic. No the Valium didn't work, the itching wakes me up. Given that the number of years there has got to be a better answer. No MS, no diabetes, no bug bite, tested for literally everything. There has got to be an answer, there are too many of us suffering to be passed off with \"emotional stress or bug bite\"",

    "question": "I am a 34 year old female. I have been experiencing extreme itching, mostly on my hands and feet, and it has been going on for at least 10 years. The past few months it has progressively become worse and worse and I sometimes wake up at night scratching myself till it bleeds.My GP has done blood tests for allergies as well as to check my liver function, which came back negative. So that's ruled out. There is no rash, bumps of any kind.The only mediaction that temporarily relieves the itching is Aterax (contains a calming agent as well as anti histamine)Can you please give me advice on how to handle this situation and what the possible causes could be?",
