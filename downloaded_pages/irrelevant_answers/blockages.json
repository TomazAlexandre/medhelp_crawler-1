            "answer": "I am not a doctor, so I cannot assure you that you do not require a bypass, but having gone through MI and stent a year back I had same concerns and I have gathered some information on this.I have come to know that blockages can be managed by three different methods which are equally effective:i.\u00a0\u00a0Bypassii. Stentiii. Medicines, diet control, exercise and stress free lifestyle.Of course you will need medicines, diet control and exercise/low stress life even with bypass and stent. If I correctly remember there are studies which substantiate above and have approval of health authorities. You can get lot of similar information on the net and if some of the forum decide to respond to your message they can give more accurate information on this. You have not mentioned whether you have any symptoms of blockages?? If you do not have them you have less reasons to worry.I hope this helps??",

            "answer": "A lot depends on your family history too. I have had stents, lost 35 lbs, got cholesterol low normal, all the right things and then BAM, ended up having 5 bypasses in a hurry. I feel better now than for years and am not sorry in the least that I had it done. I still do all the exercise I was doing, eating all the right things as before, taking all the right meds. So hopefully this will last another 20 yrs or 20,000 miles, whichever comes first. I also have diabetes and am trying to keep it under control as well. Good luck",
