            "answer": "Your blood sugar is definitely not under control. You say your blood sugar is 200 in the morning. That is very high for fasting. You don't say what your numbers are two hours after meals. If those are high and all you are on is a basal (long-acting) insulin then it sounds as if you also need to be on a bolus or fast-acting insulin before each meal dose determined by an Insulin:Carb ratio. That is the standard of care and if your doctor doesn't understand that (many don't) you should see an endo. When you get on the right basal-bolus doses, you will see those numbers come down. But if you are eating a lot of carbs, you will be fighting a losing battle. The more you reduce your carbs and the more you exercise, the easier it will be to manage your diabetes. Also, if you are overweight, losing the weight will help tremendously.As for the food, I would suggest planning healthy (and tasty!) low carb meals and shopping for them. Perhaps you can ask your husband to support you in this for the sake of your health and if he wants to eat junk he can do it outside the house.",

            "answer": "Insulin mixes are an out of date form of treatment. The standard is a basal insulin such as Lantus or Levemir and a bolus such as Novolog, Humalog or Apidra. You might want to work with an endo. Sounds like your other problems are complicating your diabetes, hang in there!",
