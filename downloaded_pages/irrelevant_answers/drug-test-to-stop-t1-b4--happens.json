    "question": "A new class of drug, the anti-CD3 antibody, is currently being developed. CD3s are the immune T-cells that cause the body\u2019s destruction of its own islet cells. It is hoped that the anti-CD3 drugs will delay or prevent this destruction, circumventing the need for islet transplant surgery. Immunologist Herman Waldmann, who pioneered this idea beginning in 1993, likened it to orchestrating a \u201ccease-fire\u201d in the body\u2019s immune system.ii Clinical trials are still underway for this promising treatment for Type 1 diabetes.",
