            "answer": "My sister measured larger than she really was and it was due to more amniotic fluid than baby. Her gap was much larger than yours, she was measuring 40 weeks at 23 weeks; this was a very severe case. I'm sure everything will be fine :)",

            "answer": "I'm measuring ahead, but the baby is not larger than he should be.\u00a0\u00a0The only reason I am measuring to far ahead is simply the way he is laying, so hopefully you have no issues and its something as simply as the way your LO is positioned.",

            "answer": ":-) Another reason would be if you had two babies in there <3 I'm sure that's ruled out after all the ultrasounds etc. I really hate how the Drs make\u00a0\u00a0you wait for another appointment and let you go home all worried about what's happening. I am sure it's the positioning of the baby as well but keep us posted. Good luck to you and wishes of peaceful rest of the pregnancy and happy birth!",

    "question": "Ok. So i went to my doctor appointment and she seemed a little concerned that i was measuring 5 weeks a head of schedule. She scheduled me an ultra sound for Aug. 9th but its got me curious. Any one else measuring/measured that far ahead and what was the reason? I dont have gestational diabetes so that's ruled out for me.",
