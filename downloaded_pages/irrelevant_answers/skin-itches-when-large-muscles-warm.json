            "answer": "Hi,So even you are having itchiness post exercise. Is it generalized or local? If it is generalized then the cause could be neuropathy and you need to evaluate yourself as rotham.But if it is local itchiness after exercise then it is certainly due to allergic contact dermatitis.You need to visit dermatologist and discuss regarding this.Alternatively you can be started on Anti-histamines and anti-allergy medications.Keep me posted if you have any queries.Bye.",

            "answer": "Hi,You can take Vitamin B12 supplement if you continue to have burning sensation after you exercise.You can also try taking cetrizine tablet just before work out and see whether it works or not. If it works then probably your pathology would be allergic.Hope this helps you.Bye.",

            "answer": "Hi,I read the above thread and you state to the the person \"you need to evaluate yourself as rotham\". I tried to locate 'rotham' but found nothing. What is it?I am asking because I have a similar condition. I am a very active 49 year old male, living in Canada (cold climate, lots of central heating, which means dry air, even with humidifier on the furnace) and the itching interferes with my work-out so much so that I dread doing them. As a result, I miss some workouts. The itching starts on my torso and arms just when I start to break a sweat (about 7 minutes in) and continues for the next 3 minutes or so until I am sweating heavily. This happens no matter where I am working out, home, gym, indoor soccer arena. But it only happens in the winter, never in teh summer.Appreciate your insight",
