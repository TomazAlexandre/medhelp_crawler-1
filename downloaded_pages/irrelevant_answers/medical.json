            "answer": "It sounds to my like it may be hypoglycemia. It can cause symptoms just like this. Keep a dairy of when you are not feeling well what you ate for up to 2 hours of you not feeling well. When getting normal blood work it will not show up because you have to be activally having an attack. You can also get an inexpensive testing kit at walgreens. I get exactly like this when mine drops. If you are eating a diet in high carbs, low protien it can cause it. If you eat for instance cereal in the morning, 2 hours later you may get a feeling of unwell because your blood sugar is too low. Cereal tends to be a simple carb in most cases plus the sugar from the milk. Are you overweight? You also could be insulin resistant. I told someone not too long ago that when I have severe low blood sugar I\u00a0\u00a0feel as though I am drunk. I run into walls, I am dizzy, unwell, I feel that I am blacking out and I am in a fog and I am overall weak. I am so exhausted that I just want to sleep. I too lack concentration, like I am unable to function as a whole. I have been able to manage it. I got the book Hypoglycemia for Dummies. Hopefully this is what you have. Its quite managable really once you know what it is,Much luck to you!Paula",

            "answer": "http://www.hypoglycemia.org/hypo_test.aspTake this test and see if you do in fact have hypoglycemia. Just from reading from a few sites it seems like its possible for you. I have it pretty bad and I have to be very careful. It sure has made dieting a pain since I have to have snacks all the time just to keep it normal.",

    "question": "I have been feeling not myself for quite some time. About 4 years ago I went through a medical scare and think I may be suffering from some anxiety, but not sure any more. I have daily spells of not feelling good, it doesn't last all day most of the time, but occurs at least every 2 hours. I feel very lightheaded, or unsteady, my vision seems to feel blurry,my legs have pain and weakness, and I have severe lack of concentration and energy. I go to be every night with hopes that I will wake up the next day and feel like I used to and that does not seem to be the case. I have recently went to my Doctor and he ran an extreme amount of blood work which all came back perfect. He checked my Thyroid, diabetes, immune deficiency, cbc, etc. I am hoping somebody has an answer out there, that may help me to stop feeling so horrible. Thank you for your help!!!!!!!!!!! I hope!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
