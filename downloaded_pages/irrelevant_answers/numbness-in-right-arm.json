            "answer": "Hi,If you have numbness in only one particular position, in most probability, it is due to pressure/compression on a nerve or blood vessel. Smoking can cause peripheral vascular disease. Spinal stenosis also could have progressed. Also, general disease like diabetes, hypothyroid, Vitamin B deficiency, alcoholism also need to be ruled out.Regards",
