            "answer": "With having the diabetes, the weight gain wouldnt be doing the diabetes or your blood glucose levels very good.I would say that you need an increase in the thyroid meds and possibly a change in the diabetes medication as that may be 'counteracting' with the thyroid medications.Its basically a catch 22 situation.Are you on Metformin or Insulin and are you also being prescribed a vascular medication?If so these meds can interfere with your thyroid med.You dont have much longer to go before seeing the Endo but it may be worth asking about the diabetes medication counteracting with the thyroid medication.The 'dull' ache under the ribcage is from hypo...I have had it too so dont panic there.It would feel like my ribs were 'digging in'.Thats basically inflammation from being hypo.Keep an eye on your diabetes by doing yr bloods (finger *****) every morning to keep track of it.And believe me...you are FAR AWAY from dying.Hugs xxx",

            "answer": "Athenol is a beta blocker to slow the heart rate down.This suggests that your blood pressure is up and heart rate too.The first thing I would do is ask the Endo to check your blood glucose and ask for a prescription for Metformin (brand name here in Australia - Diabex) as this will bring your glucos levels down and also help with weight gain.As a diabetic, you know what to eat and also sticking to a low GI diet.My partner lost 9 kilograms after being on Metformin for 3 months and also exercising on the treadmill everyday.It is important to keep the vascualr system in the leg going well by walking, treadmill etc as this if the arteries in the legs get blocked, it can cause many problems including ulcerations.Sometimes its a catch 22....we HAVE to get on meds to control the condition.But remember that diabetes meds CAN absorb the T4 med if your put on one so best to take the T4 med at night.Docs usually suggest a diet regime first as once on meds for diabetes , you are on them for life.If the weight isnt coming off because of the thyroid issues...I'd be asking the Endo for meds for BOTH.Good luck :)",

            "answer": "The bruising is a haematoma which is basically bleeding under the skin (a bruise)...nothing to worry about as long as the bruise doesnt get bigger and 'pool'.In other words.....continue swelling.If it does, then a Doc just syringes the Haematoma (blood) out and all returns to normal although tissue swelling may make the arm sore for a while.Umm...we have all had lazy teenagers at some stage in our lives lol.My girls were nightmares from he// lol.......but now theyve grown , we get on great!Dont pick up after them......and if their washing isnt picked up off their floor...dont wash it.Do what I did lol.....chuck it out the window to hang off the nearest tree......Amazing how fast they learn when you do this (hehehe).If they dont pick up their cups/mugs after drinks...hide the crockery and use disposable lol.I had paper plates and cups for about a month before they took the hint.Not worth getting yourself upset over.....took me YEARS to learn that lol.Hugs xxx",
