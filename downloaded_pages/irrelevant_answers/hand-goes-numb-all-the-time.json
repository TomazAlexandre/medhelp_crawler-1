            "answer": "There are 3 major nerves that control the working of the hand and all or some can be compromised by problems such as diabetes. So if you're experiencing that condition or any other medical issues that could impact your nerves metabolically, please check with your doc.But other problems that can impact the nerves in the hand can stem from problems starting at the neck or in regions of the armpit, around the elbow or as the other poster suggested at the wrist. To find out what's going on, you'll need to think back on any injuries you've had (if injury is the issue) that could have occured at the neck, the armpit, the elbow or at the wrist - although carpal tunnel can occur with no injury per se, only repetitive use of the hands/wrists.Compression of the nerves anywhere along the neck or the length of the arm could be a problem.",
