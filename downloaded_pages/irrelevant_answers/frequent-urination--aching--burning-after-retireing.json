    "question": "I am a\u00a0\u00a070yr. women who has had numerous bladder infections over the years. Recently, with Diabetes, I have been urinating several times a night.\u00a0\u00a0I have no current infection, and feel my Diabetes is in good control,. Also have IBS-C.and am always fighting constipation. I am experiencing after abt 3 am. urination, a burning in my urethrea, and from my navel to breastbone, aching in the hips, thighs and sometimes at the sides of my abdomen and in back at waist. Last night i also had stinging in my feet and hands . If i get up and sleep in a chair at night or when i am up during the day, i have very few problems.Due to this I get only 3-4 hrs sleep at night. Occasionally, I will have a night without this.Could this be due to the IBS ? or Neuropathy?",
