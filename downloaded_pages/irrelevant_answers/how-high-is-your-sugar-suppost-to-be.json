            "answer": "I have gestational diabetes and test my blood sugar 4 times a day. Anything close to or past 144 is a high reading. It's not a major concern unless you are consistently testing high. If every time you test you get a reading like you had you should put a call into whoever is wanting you to monitor your blood sugar because they will want to get those numbers back into a normal range through either diet changes or through the use of insulin. You are not in any danger but the baby is being affected by the high numbers because of the over use of its tiny pancreas which results in an over nourished baby which tends to result in a larger than average baby. But that's assuming you're diabetic and not just being monitored as a precaution.",

I feel horrible ill take it again in a bit and if its high ill go to the hospital. its better to be safe then sorry.",

            "answer": "145 is too high. I have type 2 diabetes and pregnancy numbers are supposed to be much lower than non pregnancy numbers. It should be between 65-95 first thing in the morning before eating and under 120- two hours after eating. If it's higher than that the doctor needs to adjust your meds. I see a perinatologist (high risk/diabetes doctor) and she adjusted my meds cause mine were that high. Now they are great and I take 1000 mg of metaformin 2x a day and 7.5 mg gyburide 2x a day",

            "answer": "You don't need to go to the hospital if it's 145, with your next meal you need to cut down your sugars or carbs, which ever is making it that high. I've had my sugars at over 200 a couple times, that's when you need to worry. 145 is elevated but not enough worry to go to the hospital. Just enough worry to call your doctor tomorrow and let them know",
