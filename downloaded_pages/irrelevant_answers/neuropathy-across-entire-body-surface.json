    "question": "On November 7th, I started post-exposure prophylaxis for possible (but unlikely) rabies exposure.\u00a0\u00a0I had Human Rabies Immune Globulin in the buttocks and RabAvert vaccine in left deltoid.\u00a0\u00a0I had another vaccine shot 3 days later in right deltoid.\u00a0\u00a0Within days of initial shots, I started to experience numbness in legs and feet.\u00a0\u00a0Also developed cold/flu like symptoms within one week.\u00a0\u00a0Within two weeks, numbness had encompessed entire body to include lower extremities, groin, trunk, arms, face, scalp.\u00a0\u00a0Getting minor fasciculations in abdomen, burning sensations on skin surfaces, intermittent Lhermitte's Sign when flexing neck. Some fatigue and muscle weakness. I had MRI of brain & C-spine with contrast - OK.2 x EMG/NCS's - Both OK.\u00a0\u00a0Waiting on blood work looking at antibodies and other things.\u00a0\u00a0It's been over 5 weeks since initial shots and no improvement.\u00a0\u00a0Some autonomic (gastro) symptoms like diarrhea, then constipation. Also \"sexual\" dysfunctions.\u00a0\u00a0I believe strongly that this is an autoimmune reaction to the rabies vaccine.\u00a0\u00a0I just hope my condition is not permamnent.\u00a0\u00a0I have no history whatsoever though some relatives do have autoimmune disorders such as Type 1 Diabetes and Lupus.\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts? Does the immune system calm down after initial attack and let the body heal or does it keep going?\u00a0\u00a0I should mention that I was also on Lipitor.\u00a0\u00a0Any similar stories out there?\u00a0\u00a0I wanted to post this question to the Dr. forum but can never get in.",
