            "answer": "My sons abdominal circumference measured consistently big like 97th percentile, everything else average. Supposedly its an indicator for gedtational diabetes but all my tests with him came back fine, he was just a big baby. Anyway, the risk is a high chnace of getting stuck or shoulder dislocation but it completely depends on your pelvis and how your progressing. Your dr will be aware of all this and able to talk you through it. A scan closer to due date will give you a better idea. Wishing you lots of luck!",
