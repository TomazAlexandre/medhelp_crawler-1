Doesn't necessarily mean we will get any of the autoimmune condition, even if they might run in the family, it just means we have more of a chance.\u00a0\u00a0The best we can do is to live a happy, stress free as possible and healthy nutritional life style, to build and keep a healthy\u00a0\u00a0immune system, and to keep our weight in tack.Good luck to the both of you.",
