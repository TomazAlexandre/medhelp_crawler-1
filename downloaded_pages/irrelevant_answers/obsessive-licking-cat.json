    "question": "Our cat WILL NOT stop licking himself. Ripping out his hair and creating huge red sores. We've got him on prednisolone from the vet, had an allergy shot, sprayed hydrogen peroxide, no chew, and even tried wrapping the wound but he still manages to lick and lick and lick. Is there a nasty tasting home remedy we can make to spray on him to get him to stop. He is not lonely, always someone home and we have another cat, we have not moved or changed anything about the cat's diet, schedule, etc. He just obsessively licks.",
