    "question": "I am a 49 year old male with average height and build. I run 4-6 days per week 3-4 miles a day and have been for years. I have noticed recently that sometimes during my run I get really dizzy and fatigued. Sometimes this carries over after I finish. I usually just run through it but it seems to be happening more and more frequently. I think it is digestive as I sometimes get relief if I eat something after I run or drink milk or juice. I know it is not simply my being tired because it does not happen everytime and cannot be tagged to the distance I run or speed I run. Has anyone ever dealt with this kind of thing? How did you deal with it? I am wondering if this has something to do with sugar imbalances? Early Diabetes symptoms? Any help would be greatly appreciated.Thanks!",
