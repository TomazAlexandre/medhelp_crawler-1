            "answer": "Jakiesnan,I am a volunteer and I can only offer advise from my own experiences. I am also a Type 1 diabetic and have relocated several times in my life to different states. I agree with the comment posted about using your insurance company listings as a start. Always look for an Endocrinologist rather than an Internist because they generally specialize in diabetes care.Then I think calling each Doctor and asking specific questions regarding their experience with diabetics is very helpful. You can get a very good feel about a doctors knowledge based ion the answers to some basic questions. Also staying informed about diabetes by joining websites like this one will give you information regarding maintaining a healthy life style with diabetes and the newest medical updates. Lastly I think going with your instincts is crucial. You must feel comfortable and confident with a doctors \"bedside manner\". I hope this was helpful. Good luck in your move.",

            "answer": "I would like to suggest that you go to the website www.jdrf.org and click on the link on the left side of the home page that starts with \"Our Online Diabetes Support Team (ODST)\". This will bring you to a window where you can type in your question and can ask to have the nearest local chapter of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation contact you. By doing this, you can meet some other parents of type 1 children, and these parents may be able to make first-hand recommendations about doctors in your new area. Please note that the organization itself, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, cannot recommend specific doctors. But the members of this organization certainly live with type 1 diabetes and individual members may be able to tell you about their experiences with good doctors in your new area. Furthermore, it will be helpful to you to become part of a network of caregivers of type 1 children so that your grandson may meet other kids who deal with the same issues that he does.",

Just found a young, progressive Dr, that Jake likes and we are moving. I was hoping that the jdrf would be able to make some suggestions. They have been very helpful to me already. Also the doctordirectory link will be one to keep on hand. Again thank you both.",
