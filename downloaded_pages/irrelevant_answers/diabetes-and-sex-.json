            "answer": "Hi Caly,diabetes can have an impact on interest in and ability to engage in sex, more likely if blood sugars are chronically high.Normal blood sugars are fasting 70 - 95 and post eating less than 140 (ideally < 120).Blood sugars consistently higher than 140 are known to cause circulatory and nerve problems.\u00a0\u00a0If nerves are damaged, then the ability to engage in sex will become less.Diabetes, as with any chronic illness, can contribute to depression which can also affect interest in and ability to have sex.Hope this will be helpful to you.",
