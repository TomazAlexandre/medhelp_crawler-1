            "answer": "one quick question, how long have you had high blood pressure? do you have any other health problems like heart disease, diabetes?it doesn't sound completely unreasonable for you to try the DASH approach. you may want to check your pressure a few times a week in the beginning just to make sure you're getting it down. 130/80 is a good goal and you should be around that. some new recommendations are suggesting that BP should be lower in people with other health problems- like the one's i asked you about (but not limited to just those).obviously the goal of keeping your BP down is to reduce the risk of complications that are associated with long term high BP.you don't have to take any drugs that you don't want to, and you should not feel anxious about seeing your dr. i'm sure he/she isn't going to force you to take anything. if the benefits and risks of your choices have been clearly explained to you, then it's your call at the end.",

    "question": "I am 54 years male. My recent 3 readings of BP was 140/100 I was awaiting a nasal operation and the doctor gave me Zanadip which made me sick due to that I have diverticulitis. I then went back to my doctor stopped taking the Zanadip and I said to him I will need 3 month or so to reduce my BP naturally by DASH Plan (Dietary approach to stop hypertension) My doctor said he did not believe in any of that and tried to start me on another drug which I refused. I am 9 weeks into the DASH plan and reduced salt. My last 2 BP readings one month apart at the surgery were (1) 140/90 and (2) 130/85 I am due the next reading in 3 weeks. Sometimes my BP is high 140/90 after a meal, but in the morning my BP reads at present home reading of sometimes 130/84 and even lower 128/80So can you advise and I feel anxious when I meet the doctor because I do not want a drug when I do not need oneJimbo PLEASE ADVISE ME",
