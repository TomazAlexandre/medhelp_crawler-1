            "answer": "The answer to your question is yes, you can.\u00a0\u00a0It all depends on the severity of your symptoms and your tolerance for them, along with how perceptive your doctor is, and what tests he might have done over the years.\u00a0\u00a0If you have been tested for possible thyroid problems, please post results and their reference ranges shown on the lab report.\u00a0\u00a0If not tested, you should request to be tested for Free T3 and Free T4 (not the same as Total T3 and Total T4), along with TSH they always test for.\u00a0\u00a0Also a good idea to test for Vitamin D, B12 and ferritin.What are those symptoms you mentioned?",

            "answer": "My old doc. tested me but for TSH, T3 & T4...I've since changed doctors and I just had my labs for Free T3, Free T4, Thyroid antibody and TSH. Plus I've been diagnosed with IBS, so i'll have those labs at the same time. I have a previous thread were I was discussing my symptoms and the tests and results of them in another thread, feel free to have a read.The reason why I ask, is because there have been many symptoms that I've had for many years that I never contributed to a thyroid problem but since doing more research and discussing my symptoms with my sisters (both have Graves),an ER doc. as well the on call nurse from my insurance, I'm thinking that I've had this for a very long time. If this is actually what is going on within me but seriously it all makes sense.",

            "answer": "My thyroid symptoms have been going on since I was at least 15 years of age (I'm 40) but not due to a thyroid gland problem but a cellular problem. My thyroid gland started to act up about 4 or 5 years ago.",

            "answer": "Hi Red_Star, How are feeling this fine day? My doc. says I should stop doing research online but since no one seems to think I have Graves and/or Diabetes, I'm not going to listen to them. We'll let the tests tell the story. Going over my past and current diagnosis's and symptoms, they all link back to the Hep B. which I was diagnosed with at 19. Then at 26 I was diagnosed with Carpal Tunnel, doc. couldn't figure out why. Then at 29 with Bipolar, at 33 with Interstitial Cystitis after being treated for UTI symptoms for 3yrs even though tests came back neg. Now at 39 with IBS and elongated right lobe of liver.I have 4 children all were rather small babies 6lb 8oz (now 18), 6lb 13oz (now 15), 7lb 2oz (now 13) and 5lb 4oz (now 3 1/2). I've had preterm labor with one, gestational diabetes and placental abruption with another, 2 miscarriages in 3yrs (2yrs before my last, doc said I can't carry babies anymore, we sure showed him),My symptoms now are: Morning Glucous tests: 63-68, Heart palpations, Sweats, night sweats, fatigue, weakness, tired, can't gain weight/weight loss, hair falling out more than usual, frequent urination and loss of bladder control,UTI symptoms (no UTI), no menstrual period (over 1 year), IBS constipation/diarrhea,dry eyes, twitchy eyes, gritty eyes, blurred vision (especially in morning), headaches, cold hands and feet, excessive hunger, light headed/dizzy, nausea (no vomiting), Terry's Nails (whitish nail w/no moon and dark line near nail bed, reddening of feet (occassional swelling), process food quickly.I think I got it all...but doc. thinks I'm having panic attacks...LOL!",

    "question": "Can you have a thyroid problem for say 20 or 30 years and not know it? I'm just curious because a lot of the things I've been experiencing (with more severity) I've had for quite some time and doing some research, things that I was diagnosed with in the past, all point to a thyroid problem.",
