I'm not sure that the answers you seek will be on this forum, unless you have or are recovering from Ovarian Cancer or perhaps think you may have it. I know your question is important and I hope you find the correct forum in order to be better served.Perhaps the Women's Health??. Most importantly, what does your Dr. say?Good luck,Sandy",

            "answer": "I am taking Tamoxifen as a preventive measure. I had a recurrence of LMP ovarian cancer and I had chemo for a year. The last scan has cleared a small patch I had. Tamoxifen is supposed to cut the estrogen supply. I do not know whether Evista will promote Estrogen !! I cannot get to other forum because of the daily quota for new questions and help. Hopefully I can pose this question to Dr.Ann Kathryn one of these days. Thanks.",

            "answer": "Hi again,From what I understand Evista is a \"Serm\"\u00a0\u00a0 ( _____ Estrogen Receptor Modulator) .. Which I was told actually \"repels\" estrogen. I was put on it about 7 years ago, when I just flat out refused to continue the HRT\u00a0\u00a0since my mammograms were looking suspicious and yet nothing turned up thankfully. I was also told that Evista (even though couldn't be advertised as such) actually showed fewer breast cancers with users. Now I believe that the link has been made and they actually are allowed to \"make the connection\" publicly . But as far as using along with tamoxifen, I'm just not sure at all .. But I'm fairly certain that Evista will not promote estrogen. You might try looking at Evista's home page.. But you know, I'm not a dr.. just repeating what my Dr. said back in 01.. Good luck with it.. Sorry I'm not much more help..Sandy",

            "answer": "Hi -- I took tamoxifen to prevent an ovarian cancer recurrence (didn't work) and then went for another opinion after the recurrence trying to prevent breast cancer (my mother died of that, my sister of ovarian) -- she put me on evista as the tamoxifen didn't work.\u00a0\u00a0When I went for another opinion the doctor said that tamoxifen, evista, and a couple other drugs were all serms and that it was six of one half a dozen of the other --- I don't know that you should be taking evista and tamoxifen together , but the evista is definitely not a estrogen receptor.\u00a0\u00a0And who knows, maybe with them both it will help ward off further cancer problems.\u00a0\u00a0Just be careful because both can cause blood clots -- ask about taking lose dose (81 mg) aspirin or 1 mg warfarin to prevent the risk of clots.P.S.\u00a0\u00a0I am in the middle of treatment for another recurrence -- the evista didn't prevent an ovarian recurrence....",
