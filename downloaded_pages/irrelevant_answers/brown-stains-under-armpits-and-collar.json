            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The brown stains could be due to the sweat reacting with soap, detergent, perfume, deodorant, oil, or anything else that comes in contact with either your skin or the cloth. The other possibility is high acid content in sweat. If this is the case, then causes like diabetes, kidney problems etc will have to be looked into.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
