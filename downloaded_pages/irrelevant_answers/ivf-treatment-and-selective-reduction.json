            "answer": "A couple of questions--how old are you, and couldn't they just implant one really good grade AA embryo if they are so concerned about multiples? The chances of it splitting are pretty slim. Try not to be heartbroken--it's still very early in the game to worry about this yet, in my opinion :) I feel you, though...it's been a long road for me, too. I did IVF in July. It's a lot to go through, but honestly, you get used to it. Finding a really good connection to someone on a forum who you can talk with is also extremely helpful. I know it really helped me :) Good luck to you, and try not to worry about this possibility yet.",

            "answer": "Hi,it is perfectly possible to have a healthy pregnancy (even twins) with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It will take a lot of work and effort, but definitely possible and worth it.Second is that they shouldn't put in more than 2 embryos.\u00a0\u00a0That definitely reduces the chances of multiples.Don't give up.\u00a0\u00a0YOu have options!\u00a0\u00a0If things are approached the right way you could have your own baby soon.",

I'm certainly willing to go through anything to get pregnant.",
