            "answer": "I see no reason why your mother wouldn't survive. The things you describe are perfectly normal procedure when dealing with breast cancer. The reason the Dr. can't tell you now about what treatment will be required is that the lymph nodes will need to be tested to see if the cancer cells have invaded them and a certain amount of tissue must be removed that is free of cancer from the breast. The scans are to be sure that there is no cancer present in any other place in the body. Only when all these things are done can another Dr. (an Oncologist) set up a treatment plan that will be of benefit to your mother. Each case is different and often requires a special treatment plan. Best wishes to you and your Mother.",
