            "answer": "Hi,How are you feeling now?Any type of tingling, burning, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a sensory nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. The main nerve involved is Sciatic nerve. Any infection at the root of nerve or compression will cause similar lesion.This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, vitamin deficiency or any nutritional deficiency.Lower back strain can cause similar concern.I think you should consult physician and if required neurologist.Bye.",

            "answer": "Hi kay,Your symptomatology does not sound like you are having MS.There are definitive guidelines, on which the diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis is based.Once internationally accepted criteria\u2019s are satisfied, then diagnosis of multiple diagnosis can be made.There are definitive lesions (suggestive of MS) on MRI also.Follow the instruction of your neurologist.If any annoying symptoms develop, then re-evaluation is needed for your cause.Hope this helps you.Bye.",

            "answer": "Hi.It would be premature to consider a diagnosis of MS at this time, especially without any brain MRI or other ancillary procedure findings to support it.It would be advisable to observe your symptoms for the moment and see if any worsening of symptoms, or development of new symptoms occur.Good luck.",
