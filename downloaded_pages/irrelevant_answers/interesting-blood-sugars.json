    "question": "A little background... at age 2 BG of 350+ put us in hospital for weekend.\u00a0\u00a0One more reading of 200.\u00a0\u00a0No meds, it normalized.\u00a0\u00a0 Now she is 8 and says she wakes up feeling sick and dizzy.\u00a0\u00a0FBG are elevated.\u00a0\u00a0A1C is elevated, but not in diabetic range.After posting before about my daughters odd readings I started monitoring her BG closely.\u00a0\u00a0I wanted to arm myself with a week's log before seeing her pediatrician next week in hopes of getting referral to pediatric endocrinologist. Maybe she is fine.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering now if there is nothing wrong at all.Other days I have monitored her her BG were higher (sometimes 140 ish).\u00a0\u00a0But lately they are on the low side of normal.\u00a0\u00a0Weird!Over the past few days this is what has happened...FBG 110The rest of the day ALL her readings were in the low 100s even after a meal.FBG 95The rest of the day her sugars were in the 80s or 70s.FBG 133The rest of the day low sugars 60 - 80She had a second A1C in 4 months and it came back 5.7%.Anyone with an opinion?",
