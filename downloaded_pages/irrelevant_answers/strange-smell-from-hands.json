    "question": "I am having a maddening problem with hand odor for the past several weeks and I have no idea what is causing it. I would best describe the odor as some sort of italian dressing or salami type odor, although it's hard to describe. My diet is normal and varied and has not changed. This smell comes and goes all day, and is not localized to either hand---it will generally be in one at a time, and it always comes from the palms. The smell does not dissipate with water at all, which leads me to believe that it must be being secreted from my pores rather than a surface smell. Does this make sense to anybody?",
