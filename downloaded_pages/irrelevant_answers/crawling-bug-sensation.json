It seems the primary causes are menopause in women, neurological issues, or infection by a spirochete (e.g. syphilis or Lyme Disease).Some doctors might tell you that you have delusional parasitosis.\u00a0\u00a0This is when people with unresolved formications become obsessed with proving they have parasites in their skin. The feelings are real, even if parasites are not.",

    "question": "For about a week I have been experiencing a weird sensation, it feels like bubbles are popping all over my body. So I keep thinking that bugs are jumping all over me. When I rub the area the feeling goes away, and I have never seen any bugs are eggs. I also have very small pin ***** \"bites\". I areas look like very small broken capillaries, they no jot itch. Every day there are more and more. I saw my family doctor and was put on 20 mg of predisone for two days, and Zyrtec daily.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms are a little better right after I take it then return. No one else in the house have sensations, one of my children had a bite maybe. But not like the amount I have. I have a get clean house and could not find any evidence of bed bugs, just found a few moths. I am a nurse so I have seen scabies and bed bug bites, and I don't have either of those rashes. Also I have a get bad headache. Help!! I feel like I am going crazy!!",
