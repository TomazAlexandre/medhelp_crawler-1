    "question": "comes and goes feel off in the morning like i cant quite shake the cobwebs. I eat i feel this rush over me that makes me feel almost a slight amount of pressure in my head. I get flush to the point where my head and ears are visibly red. I get some confusion and loss of concentration. after minimum of an hour I get real tired. this happens several times a day and always gets worse when i eat. usually when this is going on it will stay with me for several weeks some times longer than a month. As quickly as it starts I stop having the issues, for the most part. As time goes on the periods where I have these issues lasts longer and the period where I do not have the issues grows shorter. Some times as little as a week or two. I have had a CT scan, MRI, Sleep Dep test, been tested for epilepsy, many blood tests, and no answers. Been diagnosed with migraines but meds didn\u2019t help they decided that was incorrect (Never get head aches with this) Diabetes, thyroid, ruled out. what is wrong?",
