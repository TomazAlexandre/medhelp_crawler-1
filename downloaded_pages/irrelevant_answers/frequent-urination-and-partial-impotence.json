            "answer": "The frequent urination thing really depends on your age. The older you are, the more likely it is to be a result of something like prostatitis, BPH, etc. It could also be a sign of diabetes. Could be anxiety, but I'd get it checked out.The erection difficulty also depends on age. The older you are, the more likely you are to have difficulty getting rock-hard erections. Another age-related issue: if you used to wake with erections and don't anymore, you should see your doctor, because ED can be an early sign of circulatory problems. But if you're young, chances are it's just due to anxiety/stress.",

    "question": "I have had unprotected sex with a few different partners and taken some different sexual stimulants. Recently I have been experiencing frequent urination along withthe continuing urge to urinate, and also my erections are not as hard as they usually are. I get erect enough to perform but I haven't had a throbbing rock hard erection in some time unless I take a performance enhancing pill. Could these symptoms be related to an std?",
