            "answer": "Hey,Sounds anxiety related...again I'm not a doctor either.\u00a0\u00a0Stress can cause a lot of anxiety symptoms, (chest pain, numbness, feelings of fainting) and you've already had some tests like your BP and the EKG, which were normal...see your doctor and ask for just a check up, tell them about your chest pain stuff and they might order more tests....however I also have suffered with anxiety over my heart and there has been absolutly nothing wrong :)\u00a0\u00a0I doubt there is anything wrong with you as well.",
