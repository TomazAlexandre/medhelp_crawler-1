It's a good way to try it out and decide if you want to maybe invest in a candida diet cookbook or more information (or not).\u00a0\u00a0There are also plenty of free recipes on the internet.\u00a0\u00a0If you search candida recipes or paleo recipes (a nearly identical diet).Anyway, if it continues to be a problem, talking with your doctor might be a good idea just to be sure.\u00a0\u00a0He can run a few tests to make sure everything is as it should be.",
