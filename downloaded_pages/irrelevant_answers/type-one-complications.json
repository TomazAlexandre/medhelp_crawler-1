            "answer": "I recently attended a diabetes forum.\u00a0\u00a0There were several hundred people there.\u00a0\u00a0In between speakers, they held sort of a \"recognition awards\" for long-term type 1 diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0It was sort of a contest to see who had been using insulin the longest.\u00a0\u00a0The \"winner\" had been using insulin for over 60 years and several others had been for over 50 years.\u00a0\u00a0The greatest part of this presentation was that all looked like typical older people -- but they all looked healthy.\u00a0\u00a0None had missing limbs or were walking with a white cane.\u00a0\u00a0I think this says a lot for good blood sugar control.",
