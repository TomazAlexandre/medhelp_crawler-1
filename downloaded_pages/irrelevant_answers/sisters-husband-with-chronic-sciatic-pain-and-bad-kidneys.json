            "answer": "Obviously he needs to revisit his doc about his legs, since there's a chance his sugars are not being controlled well enough and could be affecting the circulation in his legs and making them hurt worse than ordinary sciatica.\u00a0\u00a0But if it's indeed pain from his spine problems, then again he needs to visit his doc, and he can prescribe pain meds for it, which they are loathe to prescribe opiates, so he could tell his doc he's heard about gaba drugs that help with pain.\u00a0\u00a0I take pregabalin (Lyrica), and its cheaper cousin is gabapentin (Neurontin), and they are anti-spasm type drugs, and I found relief from my lower back pain overnight and continue to take it for several years now.\u00a0\u00a0Aside from medicine, one good way to relieve sciatica is to do yoga type stretching exercises, but since he has spine problems, it's best for him to ask his doc if maybe some physical therapy could be ordered for him to ease the pain.\u00a0\u00a0I tried yoga for a while and had to quit because my spine is wrecked up and I managed to hurt it temporarily whilst doing those.\u00a0\u00a0Drinking extra water is good for the kidneys, by the way, and helps a person feel better in general.",

            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for your question. Sciatica is a set of symptoms including pain that may be due to compression or irritation of the sciatic nerve, which may occur due to disc hernia, disc degeneration or spondylolithesis. So, the treatment modalities also range from anti-inflammatory, physiotherapy, non-surgical decompression or surgical decompression. But, surgical modalities may have 50% chances of relapse of pain. Before opting for surgical procedures, you should evaluate both the pros and cons. Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "I know he's not going to have surgery.\u00a0\u00a0His health isn't good enough and his insurance isn't good enough and most people seem to have as much or more trouble after surgery to the low back.\u00a0\u00a0If only it worked as well as cervical spine surgery, but I think it's because more weight is on the lower spine that it just doesn't hold up well.Ggreg, I'll see if he is allowed to take Lyrica with his bipolar and other problems.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
