            "answer": "Erythrasma is a long-term bacterial infection that usually appears in the area between skin folds such as the groin or armpit. Diabetes, obesity, excessive sweating, poor hygiene, or immune deficiency may usually predispose to acquiring this condition. Because it is caused by a bacterial infection, it can manage to spread during skin to skin contact.\u00a0\u00a0It is recommended to gently scrub the skin patches with antibacterial soap to help them go away. Prescription medications by your doctor may also be indicated and may lead to complete recovery. Have this evaluated by your doctor for proper management. Take care and regards.",
