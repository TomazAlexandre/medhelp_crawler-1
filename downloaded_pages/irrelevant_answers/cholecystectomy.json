    "question": "My Dad has his Gallbladder removed 18 months ago and has not had excellent health since.\u00a0\u00a0He also has sugar diabetes which complicates his physical abilities.\u00a0\u00a0Several week's ago while on a visit with his doctor, they discovered they had not removed a stint which was placed in him as a bile duct.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors wanted to immediately remove the stint by going down his throat with camera to find and remove.My Dad does not want to go through this and feels that the pain of going back through his throat could lead to other issues and has asked the physican to consider going through his side.\u00a0\u00a0The physican said he put the tube in by going down the throat, and needed to take it out through the throat.\u00a0\u00a0He agreed they should have taken it out long ago, but it was not uncommon to take it out much later.He said my Dad was OK to wait a month before making the decision, but should not wait 6 months or longer.\u00a0\u00a0My Dad is 81 years old and will not consent to doing this through the esophagus.\u00a0\u00a0They initially removed the Gall Bladder through his side, and that is where he wants the tube removed.\u00a0\u00a0What advise could you offer?\u00a0\u00a0Is there risk of injury by going down the throat and damaging the larynx?\u00a0\u00a0If he leaves the stint in his body will there be repercussions and what might those be?",
