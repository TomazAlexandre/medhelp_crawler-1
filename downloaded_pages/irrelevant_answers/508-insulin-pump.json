However, in order to make personal contact, you will need to go through the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's Online Diabetes Support Team, for we cannot allow personal e-mail addresses or contact info to be posted here. We have to delete that sort of info. But if there is someone who is interested (if this is a free donation), then post a comment here, and then both of you need to contact www.jdrf.org and give permission for your e-mail addresses to be passed back and forth among each other. But you will need to specify that this is a case of donated supplies and not a sale.",

            "answer": "Then I believe your best solution is going to be to contact the JDRF folks as explained above, explain your offer and ask to be contacted by the nearest local JDRF chapter. They will get the chapter to contact you and then you can make the offer to local folks. Sounds like a wonderful offer. Thank you for helping folks out like this.",
