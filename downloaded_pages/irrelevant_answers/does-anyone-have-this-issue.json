            "answer": "Maybe you have pregnancy induced breathing problems while sleeping.I used to have a desease problem thingy when I was still a tot, my mama was tellin me that I used to stop breathing in my sleep for like 30 seconds and then start breathing again.I remember back when I was I think maybe 4, It's one of the few memories I can remember from WAYYY back then, I just remember a buncha doctor peoples in my room had me set up on a stretch, and they were sticking all these round things on my chest and forhead n stuff, and I had this lil thing on my finger.They were trying to monitor breathing, but I forgot what they called my problem.Even now sometimes I still do it, and it always happens when I'm napping or doazing, and I wake up out of breath like I just raced a 100yrd sprint like back when I used to be a state swimmer.lolI haven't caught myself doing it lately, but I wouldn't doubt that the same problem I had, could be pregnancy induced.Cuz seeing they have stuff like pregnancy induced diabetes n a **** load of other things.So yeah.Just tell your doc your prob.I'm sure he'll be able to help.",
