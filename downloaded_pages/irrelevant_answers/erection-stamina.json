    "question": "I am 43 years old. I have just started dating a new woman. Twice in the last two days, we have attempted sex. Prior to the act, I have an erection, which is strong. This is present for as long as an hour before. However, when it comes time for the act, both times the erection is lost and I can not get it back. Both times this occurred right at the time of penetration. I have been taking Propecia for a year. I am coming off a long term marriage, where sex was very limited (once a year or so) so I really can not tell if this was something that may have occurred in the past as I have nothing to compare. The first time we attempted sex (three days ago) there was no problem. I work out and have a good diet. Thanks",
