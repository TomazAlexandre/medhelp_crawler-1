            "answer": "Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the prime reasons many women gain weight/can't lose it. Very often, hypothyroidism and insulin resistance accompany PCOS; have you been tested for those?\u00a0\u00a0For hypothyroid, you need to be tested for TSH, Free T3 and Free T4. Monitoring blood sugar levels will help identify insulin resistance. Recommend that you get tested further.Often metformin is prescribed for PCOS; has your doctor mentioned that?\u00a0\u00a0metformin often helps people lose weight, because it improves insulin sensitivity.Cycling for 10 minutes/day is good, but probably not enough.\u00a0\u00a0You should try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise/day, whether that be from the cycling, a brisk walk, yoga, zumba or something else.You also\u00a0\u00a0have to make changes in your diet.\u00a0\u00a0If you eat junk food, such as chips, cookies, candy, etc, you should exchange them for veggies, fruit cheese, yogurt, low fat dairy, nuts, seeds, etc. Opt for plenty of protein and complex carbs and limit simple carbs, such as those found in sugary foods, products made from white flour, white rice, regular pasta etc.\u00a0\u00a0Opt for whole grain breads and pastas, sweet potatoes, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Exchange sodas and fruit juices for water or other unsweetened beverages.\u00a0\u00a0Try Stevia instead of sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to watch portion sizes.",

            "answer": "\"Should i continue my diabetes tabs? \"\u00a0\u00a0You didn't mention that you were diabetic, too.\u00a0\u00a0By all means, if your doctor has you on diabetes medication, you should continue to take it until s/he says otherwise.If you have diabetes, you need to opt for foods that don't raise your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Those would include dairy, veggies, whole grains, etc.\u00a0\u00a0All in proper portion sizes.",
