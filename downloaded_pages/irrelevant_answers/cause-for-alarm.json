            "answer": "you are on a higher level of aspirin each day than me and I've had heart attacks. I bleedfor a lot longer than normal and bruise much easier. Just a sharp tap can cause bruisingwith me and if I cut myself shaving I look like I've been in a road accident for hours.If you have no shortness of breath, no throat discomfort, no jaw ache, no chest painsand given that you don't smoke, I would say you probably fine. It is always worth havingregular checkups if heart problems have run in your family. I have picked a route whichtakes me 30 minutes to walk and I do this every day. I know every feeling in my body asI walk the route and will know if there is anything going wrong. With early signs of heartproblems you usually notice them during exertion and then they disappear when you rest. People who don't exercise will not have this luxury because they are always at restand so the signs appear and there is no way they can allow the heart to relax any further.You sound like you are quite worried about developing heart disease, but this worry isn'tgoing to do you any good in the long run.",

    "question": "I'm a 49 yr. old white male 6'3\" 220 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0My father died at age 74 of extreme congestive heart failure (90+% blockage).\u00a0\u00a0On my last ECG (4/09) my family doctor indicated that there \"might\" be a small Q-wave, but he dismissed it as a minor issue on an otherwise good ECG.\u00a0\u00a0I had a healthy treadmill stress test result about 5 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I've recently developed a moderate bruise on the back of my right shin that is not an injury from being hit, it just started to show up and is sore, along with a mild ache in the same calf.\u00a0\u00a0I also have a small scrape in the same area that has been there for over a year.\u00a0\u00a0I'm generally healthy and active, no drugs, alcohol, or nicotine, and no diabetes, hypertension or other issues.\u00a0\u00a0I take vitamins B,E,C, and calcium along with 10mg of Lipitor and a 81 mg aspirin daily.\u00a0\u00a0As a result choloesterol is normal (160ish total).I'm starting to wonder if this is indicating developing heart problems such as early failure, blockages starting, or something else, as all issues seem to be on my lower right extremities.\u00a0\u00a0If so, what treatment, how, who and when?\u00a0\u00a0My family doctor often dismisses things unless there are blatant symptoms or discomfort so hasn't recommended anything.",
