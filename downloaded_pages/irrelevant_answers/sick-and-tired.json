            "answer": "Hello,There are many causes of nausea.\u00a0\u00a0These include stomach disorders such as gastroenteritis, gastritis, liver/gall bladder disease, cancer, medications, pregnancy, inner ear diseases like labrynthitis, ulcers/gastritis, metabolic like diabetes,hypothyroidism and adrenal diseases or neurological causes.However to confirm the status of pregnancy, I suggest you to test for pregnancy by a highly sensitive pregnancy test 10 days post ovulation with a sensitive ( 20 - 25 mIU ) pregnancy test. Also then I would suggest you to get your serum HCG levels estimated since this is more specific than urine for pregnancy tests.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

The naseaus feelings mostly gone but comes back occasionally.. I'm assuming I wouldn't be pregnant seeing as I had bleeding?",

            "answer": "Hello,Since you had bleeding for one and a half days, so chances of pregnancy are less likely. However if the nausea continues then the possibilities mentioned above need to be ruled out. In that case and threatened abortion also should be ruled out by getting your serum HCG levels done.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided.
