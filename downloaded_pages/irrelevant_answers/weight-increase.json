            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, for your height and age you do appear to be underweight. One cause is genetic. If your family in general is thin and skinny, there is nothing much you can do about it. Even without genetic predominance, some people are light weight. The other factors are presence of diseases like diabetes, hyperthyroidism, tuberculosis, poor diet, eating disorders, malabsorption syndromes, and cancers. Worms in stool is another cause.You can consult your doctor regarding this and eliminate these causes of low weight. If all is fine, consult a nutrition expert and build up a good diet program. A physical fitness trainer then can help you gain some muscle mass. However do not go for this unless the medical causes are ruled out because you may need to modify the diet and exercise program according to the problem you have. Take care!",

I had a roommate who was five feet tall and weighed 45 kilos. She was perfectly healthy. If you have always been thin and are in good health I would not worry about it.",
