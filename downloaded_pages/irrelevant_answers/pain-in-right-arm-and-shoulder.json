            "answer": "It sounds like you are very uncomfortable and I am sorry for that. I am a bit confused about the location of you pain. It may be because I am a bit tired tonight, can you be more specific?I do not think you weight loss is related to your pain. I do think that after 5 months you need to be evaluated by a health care provider, especially because you have diabetes. And if your weight loss was not planned it is even more imperative that you see your PCP.Your pain could be anything from a muscle pull or strain to a symptom of an illness.I wish I had better answers for you. I hope you will keep us informed on how you are doing. Please take care, Tuck",

            "answer": "I do not think your pain is due to any weight loss, have you seen your Dr about this? Also have you recently injured your arm or shoulder such as maybe pulled a muscle? It could be muscle strain. I would advise seeing the Dr and having x rays done so you will know for sure and can get the proper treatment. Good luck and I hope your feeling better soon:)",
