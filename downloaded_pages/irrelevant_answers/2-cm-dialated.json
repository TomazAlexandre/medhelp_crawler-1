            "answer": "I had my daughter at 33w 5d due to pre eclampsia, and she was fine. She was small, but healthy! She spent one night in a humidicrib to see if she could hold her body temperature, then she was just in the normal crib for another 2 weeks in the special care nursery. I hated leaving her there, but it was only until her weight hit 2 kilos and she was feeding normally for 24 hours. Your babies will be fine, lots of bubs are born at this stage of pregnancy!",
