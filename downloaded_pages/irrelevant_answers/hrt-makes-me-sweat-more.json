            "answer": "Hi Kathryn,It does sound like you are having a difficult time. Estrogen in general is an excellent treatment for hot flashes and night sweats if it is not contraindicated for you due to a strong negative history. If your doctor thinks it is OK for you to take, try taking the dose at night to get the best blood levels while you are sleeping. Sometimes less is better than more.But first be sure your problem is due only to menopause. It is a good idea to have a blood test done to check your thyroid (TSH), check for diabetes (glucose tolerance test), and to have a very good work up for infection if neither of those first items are abnormal.For this you might want to see an infectious disease doctor and look for fungal infection and others. Other less common causes include endocarditis (an inflamation of the heart) tuberculosis and other infections. The most important thing is to be sure the problem is due to menopause and not something else.If it is due to menopause (you'll only know this after it's clear it isn't something else) then it will be important to try different dosages of estrogen and progesterone. Also, hydration with lots of water (do this before dinner so you aren't up all night going to the bathroom), avoiding spicey foods and excercise also help.Machelle Seibel, MD",

    "question": "Hi, I am a 50yr old woman going through the menopause, I am so desperate I don't know what to do. I tried HRT for a couple of years and stopped because it wasn't working. It helped reduce the hot flushes but increased the hot sweats (day & night)to an unbearable level. I remained off HRT for about two years and during that time tried every natural alternative I could find, nothing helped. Because the hot flushes and sweats seemed to be getting worse, I asked my doctor if I could try it again. I have not had a period for three years.The same is happening again, the flushes have decreased but not gone and the hot sweats have increased. When I say hot sweats I mean a feeling that my body is overheating, sweat literally pours down my face, neck and body, my clothes stick to me and this horrible unbearable feeling lasts for up to three hours each time. This happens every day, 7 days a week, both day and night. Doing anything physical also sets it off. The last time I tried HRT I tried a couple of different types, So far this time I have only tried one type for two weeks. The doctor doubled the dose on Friday because it wasn't working, However, I feel so awful I have not taken any tonight. I just want it to stop. I thought HRT was supposed to stop these symptoms not make them worse?Please help.Kathryn",
