            "answer": "It can be related to uncontrolled diabetes. It can be related to age and puritas [dry skin] too. As we age our skin tends to dry out. If your itch dissipates after applying anything moist [lotion, cream, moist towel] to the skin, it's probably puritas, especially now as we enter our dry winter season. If so, go see a Dermatogist for he/she can Rx a topical cream that will relieve the itching, then you finish the job by applying a moisturizing cream, not lotion. If not, you need to provide us with information on how you are controlling and managing your diabetes - weight, exercise, nutrition plan, daily test results, last A1c result, and so on.",

    "question": "I have type II diabetes and my hands and feet are itching like crazy. Some times together. Wondering if this is related to diabetes. Sometimes the itching can go on for 10 minutes or longer. I've tried lotion/moisturizer, but the itching continues so I'm assuming it's not try. Help!!!",
