    "question": "My question was regarding heart rate. I am a 39 year old man. I am 5' 7\". I weigh 190 lbs. I have been back in the gym for almost two months now I do anywhere from twenty minutes to an hour of cardio every time I go in including weight training. I have been going 4- 5 days a week. Prior to going back to the gym I was living a very unhealthy lifestyle. Eating very unhealthy foods and drinking to much alcohol. My question is when I get home form working out. My resting heart rate is 92 bpm. Should I be concerned ? Will this improve ?",
