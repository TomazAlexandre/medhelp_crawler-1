            "answer": "After my MRI scan came back normal the hospital discharged me and haven't been back since. No I haven't had any other neurological symptoms or anything that would indicate any kind of problem. I have never had eye antibiotics or other drugs, I have tested negative for diabetes and HIV. It just seems so strange that there doesn't seem to be a simple explanation offered, yet the hospital just completely discharged me and that was that. Should I go back to the doctors and ask for more tests to be run?",

            "answer": "This really is a hard call as to what you should do.\u00a0\u00a0Personally, I would see a neurologist and ask that person the question as to what you should do.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't be as concerned; however, if you don't have any symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0But you have had ON in both eyes.I guess I kind of lean toward seeing the neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0There's clinical evidence if something funny is going on in your MRIs, that early treatment may prevent the disease from occurring altogether.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe your neuro will suggest continued monitoring with MRIs, exams, and symptoms.See the link below (especially under management and prognosis):http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/556957_3",

            "answer": "Hi ! I have had ON several times and have been dx with RRMS.I had MS for years before my first attack of Optic Neuritis.One disease that is more common for MS (in both eyes) than MS is Devics disease. My advice is not to waste your energy/life worrying about MS in your future. If that's what does happen their are lots of great people to help you through the future. Live today yourself & don't worry.Erin :)",

            "answer": "The doctor told me he thought it was the same eppisode of optic neuritis that moved into the other eye, not a different attack because it happened so quickly. I will go and find a neurologist, I just feel a bit ridiculous seeing as I have no symptoms and it happened over 2 years ago I hope they will take me seriously.",

It could have been due to stress, or if you have migraines, that is possible too, but your best answers will come from a skilled doctor - perhaps a neuropthamologist would be a good choice?",

    "question": "Around 2 and a half years ago when I was 18 I developed a horrible case of optic neuritis. After about a month when it was almost healed it went into the other eye. I received no treatment for either eyes and they both healed up perfectly. I had an MRI scan which came back normal. I am now 20 and have never had a problem since. However, it still freaks me out that it occured and I was never given an explanation as to why. I get freaked out reading about developing MS in 10 years time. Is there any chance it could have been caused randomly or by stress and so was just an isolated incidence? Or am I simply awaiting a whole load of neurological problems in years to come?Thanks.",
