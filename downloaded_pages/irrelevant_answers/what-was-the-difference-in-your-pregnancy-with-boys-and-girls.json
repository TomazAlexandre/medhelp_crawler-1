            "answer": "I am having another boy, and this pregnancy is completely different from our first son. With my first son, severe morning sickness to the point of a zofran pump and being hospitalized, early onset of diabetes diagnosed at 15 weeks, severe swelling, and anemia didn't set in till 38 weeks. This pregnancy, sickness wasnt bad and could be controlled with medication, diabetes test passed with flying colors, no swelling hardly; however, i have severe anemia and a heart problem called supraventricular tachycardia. Going by symptoms alone, i would have betted i was having a girl this go around, but we have a little \"hot dog!\"",

Im not gaining much wait all over....just a little in the belly (Im 18 weeks today). I will tell u this....everyone is gonna respond differently to pregnancy....whether Its ur first or fifth time being pregnant....not even identical twin women will have the same symptoms. Try to stay busy.....but it is fun trying the old wives tales out....some were riggt n some were wrong for me. Chinese gender chart was right for me and i also looked at her sonorous pics a lot and asked to get a potty shot pic of the baby early just to try n see myself what it may end up being.",
