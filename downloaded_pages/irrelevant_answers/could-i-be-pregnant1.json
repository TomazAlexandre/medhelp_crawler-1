    "question": "I am 42 yrs old I have PCO disease. I was diagnosed over 20 yrs ago.\u00a0\u00a0I took clomid 20 yrs ago and gave birth to twins.\u00a0\u00a0I started a new relationship 3 yrs ago and concieved our son with no medical help...he is now 19 months old...I developed gestastional diabetes with the pregnancy and it never went away....i was in denial about the diabetes so Idid not take my medication which i believe caused my menstral cycles to go out of whack.\u00a0\u00a0At the end of December I met with my doctor who told me if I really wanted to concieve again the drug Metformin would help with the diabetes as well as concieve.\u00a0\u00a0 I take 1500 mg a day and my sugar has been under controlsince January.\u00a0\u00a0My gyn gave me clomid which I took in March 50mg from the 5 to 9th day. I had a blood test to see if I ovulated it came back at 75...that was great except I didn't fall pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0We continued with clomid for the 2nd month again no pregnancy...I should also tell you i am a 30 day cycle except april when I was a day early. We decided not to do clomid in May and just relaxed a little with the effort.\u00a0\u00a0My period was due may 19 but did not show for 2 weeks. last sunday night I had very bad pain\u00a0\u00a0take your breath away pain in my pelvic area...after that I got spotting when I wiped that lasted for 3 days on the forth day i had enough flow for a pad right up until today. My question is could I be pregnant and the blood i am having is from a burst cyst as the bleeding is not the same as before it is very red and mucasy? If I have not given enough info just ask and i will reply\u00a0\u00a0thank you for your time",
