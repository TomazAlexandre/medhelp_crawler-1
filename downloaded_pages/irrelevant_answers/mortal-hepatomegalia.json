Her liver is VERY large (as you can see at the photo), so her life is in danger, her weight is less than 40 kg now, she could hardly eat and she has strong stomach ache. No one of our doctors could diagnose the reason.What could be the reason? There exists some tests results, but I do not have them in English now. Which tests are to be done? Any valuable information are very welcome!Thanks in advance!",
