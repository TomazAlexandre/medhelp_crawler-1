            "answer": "Hi Anne,Have you had any recent imaging? A body CT Scan?So many conditions may account for the burning sensation that you are experiencing both rare and common ones. Your physician may be correct that it is nerve related. Have you seen a neurologist? If not I encourage you to see one. Also an endocrinologist and a rheumatologist may be beneficial.From my personal experience I encourage you to keep looking. At the very least there are medications that can help reduce your pain. We know how pain can and does disrupt our normal daily routines. My heart goes out to you. Please let us know how you are doing. We'll look forward to hearing from you again.Take Care,Tuck",

            "answer": "If you don't need the Lyrica don't take it, it has so many side affects. I had to stop it, i couldn't see.Can you contact an acupuncturist? There is heat in your body, could be many reasons. Most likely from a pill you are already taking.\u00a0\u00a0How obese are you? Just because tests come back within range doesn't mean you don't have thyroid problems. 95% of women would be fine if they were on thyroid medication. I take a small dose of thyroid medication for fibromyalgia and it helps me so much, decreases the pain. Do you have hair loss or thinning? If you don't take Vitamin D please start tomorrow. Another great supplement is Iodine. Helps with weight management and a number of other things.\u00a0\u00a0Research it first. But think about it, why add another pill.\u00a0\u00a0It makes no sense. Try another approach.\u00a0\u00a0A chinese doctor they work with so many illnesses of the body, and after one of my surgeries cervical spine, I was seeing an acupuncturist they explained I was losing heat through my incision causing me so many symptoms. I wear a scarf all the time on my neck.\u00a0\u00a0It's amazing. So good luck.\u00a0\u00a0Find other ways to deal, don't just take a pill and I meet ladies all the time at the gym who stopped taking lyrica because of side affects.",

    "question": "I have an internal burning pain/burning sensation throughout my body and I am desperate for help. The pain is from head to toe. Sometimes I even end up with bad headaches. I have been suffering for a years now and it's just getting much worse. I had a total hysterectomy last year and my hormones are within range. The pain existed long before the surgery. I have a long term injury in one ankle/lower leg and it has never fully healed, remains swollen. Foot/ankle doctors just have me wearing compression stockings and orthotics. I walk fine. I am obese.\u00a0\u00a0Blood pressure meds 10mg Lisinopril that keep blood pressure within normal range.I have had Hormone test, TSH, T4, Testosterone, Comp Metabolic Panels, CBC, ANA test and all are within range. PCP just put me on presciption vitamins and he thinks I may have nerve irritation that is causing me all this burning pain. I had MRI years ago through ER, nothing found.I feel so much burning pain and don't know what to do.What is next step toward getting help, a referral or other test?",
