            "answer": "Perhaps your doctor's office is just being cautious because your results were slightly higher than they should have been.\u00a0\u00a0I could have been caused by something you ate that elevated your blood sugars ...or it could be the start of GD.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully, it's the former!I hope the second test goes well ...but I'm sorry you have to take another one (I hear that stuff they make you drink is gross!\u00a0\u00a0; ;).\u00a0\u00a0I'm hoping when my glucose test day comes, I pass with flying colors!",

            "answer": "The weird thing is that did not tell you not to eat before the test.\u00a0\u00a0My Dr explained that it had to be done in the morning and on an empty stomach.\u00a0\u00a0Dont worry, Im sure that is why you did not pass it.\u00a0\u00a0BTW, what was the result?Good luck on the next test...!",

            "answer": "yeah they never told me that i didnt have to eat anything.\u00a0\u00a0but when i got in the docs. office that day the person taking my blood was like \"that juice isnt a good breakfast is it?\"\u00a0\u00a0like thats all i should have had.\u00a0\u00a0my partner told me that i was silly for eating bread since it just breaks down to sugar right away.They didnt tell me the result but she made it seems that it wasnt a huge difference because she just said that my levels were just slightly a little high and so my doctor wanted me to take the 3 hour one just to make sure its not GD.\u00a0\u00a0Ive been reading online that this happens a lot and that women wont pass their first one and then pass their second one with no problem.\u00a0\u00a0So that made me feel a little reassured.My question now is should i eat only super healthy foods and no sweets or carbs till monday?\u00a0\u00a0or will it matter since i have to fast the day before my 3 hour test?\u00a0\u00a0Not that i dont eat healthy but i like my pasta and occasional sweet.Thanks ladies for responding it really just bummed me out today.",

            "answer": "Well, I think you should eat what you normally eat, because you in fact want to find out if it really is GD or not.\u00a0\u00a0So try to take i easy, Im sure It was because of the bread.NO stress now, its what you really dont need right now.Keep me posted, good luck!\u00a0\u00a0(You'll do fine!)",

    "question": "So i took my one hour glucose test on tuesday and thought i was good.\u00a0\u00a0then today my nurse calls me and says that my sugar levels were just slightly high and my doctor wants to do the 3 hour test now on monday.\u00a0\u00a0you have got to be kidding me!!!!\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone had this done with good results like no gestational diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0also could my sugar have been up because i had a piece of homemade bread before taking the test?\u00a0\u00a0they never told me i couldnt eat with the 1 hour test.either way when i think of diabetes i think of people who are healthy and fit, and im not that.\u00a0\u00a0No offense to anyone but i mean i could be obviously completely wrong.\u00a0\u00a0Just would like some feed back!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks ladies, im so bummed right now.",
