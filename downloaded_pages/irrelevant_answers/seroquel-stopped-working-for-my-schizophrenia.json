            "answer": "The two newest FDA approved antipsychotics are Saphris and Fanapt. A psychiatrist if no other antipsychotics worked would consider a person for Clozaril. The antipsychotic agent I take, glycine which is Phase II FDA study (google \"Dr. Javitt, glycine\") has promoted a full recovery in me. In the conventional study its given as a secondary (along with another antipsychotic) but in myself it is a primary antipsychotic (by itself). That is available but should only be administered by a psychiatrist. My recovery will be published in a case study and has been clinically noted by provider agencies. It still is in clinical study so it is in some ways an unknown quantity but is part of a new class of antipsychotics the NMDA receptor modulates that will promote a fuller recovery and won't cause tardive dyskinesia or diabetes. It can be administered with any antipsychotic except Clozaril because they interact.",

            "answer": "Yeah like ILADVOCATE said there's still more options because of newly developed ones or because some of the options are a last resort.\u00a0\u00a0Clozaril I hear is a really good one but is like best friends with agranulocytosis so it requires frequent blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0I guess on the bright side no one's ever found that it causes TD so you won't have to worry about that if they put you on it.",
