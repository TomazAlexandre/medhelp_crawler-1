            "answer": "I am sorry for both you and your pet. Diabetes can be very tricky to get the insulin dosage right. Obviously Batman is excessively thirsty, which makes me wonder if his insulin dosage is correct. If you trust the Vet you are taking him too, then continue to take him in until he is better ... or you can also take him to another Vet and get a second opinion, which is always a good thing if in doubt. I do wish you both the very best, take care!",

I have a dog that b/c of the side effects of a number of the meds he is on has urination issues as well that can not be helped so we actually set up a wee wee pad system and that seems to help. good luck, i know how frustrating it can be.",

    "question": "My dog (4 years old 13 lb Full Chihuahua - not a toy Chihuahua) was diagnosed with diabetes about a month ago.\u00a0\u00a0His urination was out of control, then when he started on insulin shots twice a day, he started urinating less.\u00a0\u00a0Then he started urinating out of control again, and his inuslin was upped from 2.5 ml to 3 ml.\u00a0\u00a0He is once again urinating out of control.\u00a0\u00a0I can't seem to get a decent nights sleep unless I kick him out of my bed (which I hate doing since he's slept with me at the foot of my bed since he was a baby).\u00a0\u00a0I can't seem to get any straight answers from the vet over why he is urinating more.\u00a0\u00a0Does his increased urination mean that he needs MORE insulin or LESS insulin?\u00a0\u00a0Does it mean that I need to watch his diet more?\u00a0\u00a0I need some help and answers.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!\u00a0\u00a0~ Batman's Mommy",
