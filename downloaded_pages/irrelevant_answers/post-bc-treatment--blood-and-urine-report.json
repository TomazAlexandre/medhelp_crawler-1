            "answer": "I also have similar tests like yours, but for me I know it's my kidneys. I am also spilling protein in my urine. But if you are healthy and have no history of kidney disease or Diabetes, then something like you are reporting may be from a medication you are taking, or even the chemo.Some cancer treatment problems do go away after a while, but\u00a0\u00a0it may even be something like the tamoxifen, as usually kidney problems, or the abnormal blood values you mention are a direct toxic effect from a medication and i have read this numerous times on medication inserts. Not that it will happen that but it could happen. Basically, my point here is that I don't know, or have a clue what this means in your case, but your doctor will either know, suspect, and/or find out. You may or may not need more testing.",

            "answer": "You know, I am not sure if low values are always worrisome at all. Albumin is pretty much the same as protein. Are you eating enough protein? It may still be recovering from the radiation as well. I gained a lot of weight with chemo and then lost a lot with radiation. basically, I am trying to say that high values are more worrisome and I may have been overtired the other day and not totally read your question correctly. My mother always has low values with these tests but she is totally healthy. Her doctor told her to eat more protein and I am not sure how much value that advice had;\u00a0\u00a0she lives in Austria.",

            "answer": "Want to add one more thing, since I am senile from all this stuff that is/was similar to what you had, and are taking. Did they do a urine test as well? Because, if you are spilling albumin the serum levels would also be low, and that is the case with me, but I am sure your doctor would have told you that, or the report. Don't worry too much, OK?

As my chlorides were high , he has also asked me to cut down on salts.I have gained lot of weight . I guess this is because of tamoxifen . There is lot of water retention in the body also I have a mild lymphedema (right arm). What should one do ?thanks.",
