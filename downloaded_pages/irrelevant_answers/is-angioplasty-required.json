            "answer": "I'm not a health professional so keep that in mind with my post.\u00a0\u00a0In my opinion, a 70% blockage will need either a stent or bypass sooner than later.\u00a0\u00a0It's the old 'blocked water pipe' analogy, a dirty pipe will eventually plug up.Needless to say, when you have a 70% blockage, you need to keep the junk in your blood under control and keep your arteries as healthy as possible.\u00a0\u00a0If you smoke, stop.\u00a0\u00a0Keep your blood pressure under control.\u00a0\u00a0Certainly you need to exercise, and if you are overweight, losing weight will help greatly.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is a huge risk. Taking good drugs like a statin and blood pressure meds is also very important.Over a period of years, I had eight stents inserted.\u00a0\u00a0In almost all cases I received a stent when the blockage was above 80%, I have to say that blockages of 40 - 70% always were eventually treated.\u00a0\u00a0I had heart bypass surgery with two 60% blockages, but these blockages were in dangerous locations (arterial branches) and I was experiencing daily angina.Everyone's situation is different.\u00a0\u00a0You are smart to learn as much as you can.\u00a0\u00a0If you send a followup post with more information about your condition, you will probably get excellent ideas that will help you.",
