It's an interesting thought, linking my vision problems to possibly something going on with the optic nerve because I have found a couple diseases that fit the bill with what I have going on. It's a great place to start and I will definitely look into meeting with a professional about it. Thanks again.",

    "question": "Hi everyone. Iam 27 years old, wear glasses, had an eye exam about 10 months ago and have had unchanged vision for about 7 years. About 6 months ago I started having dizzy spells standing and walking and even blacked out a couple times. I felt weak but I have throid problems and had been off my meds. I kinda got over it but 2 months later I had kidney attacks and had surgery 2 months ago for kidney stones. I have more surgery for that later this month as well. Within a day or 2 after surgery I got what feels like double ear infections, had headaches and the dizziness came back. Also continued dehydration and eye trouble. My vision seems perfectly clear but I get like an irritation that causes me to instinctively move my eyes up and down and side to side. Also I can be looking at something such as a pop can or patterns on a curtain and\u00a0\u00a0sometimes\u00a0\u00a0I will see the object or part of the object begin to stretch, wave or seem as though it has moved a significant distance. Although probably unrelated,\u00a0\u00a0I have raised nasty itchy rashes on my leg and left side of my scalp. Because I'm being treated for the kidney,\u00a0\u00a0the rest has went on the back burner.\u00a0\u00a0My doc says my stones are from dehydration and I know diabetes could be a culprit but as far as I know eye problems with diabetes are different than mine. I am wondering what could be causing all this? It is going to be a couple weeks before I see my Doctor and\u00a0\u00a0I'm so tired of this misery.\u00a0\u00a0Any help is appreciated. Also I apologize for the typing, I'm posting from a device other than a PC.",
