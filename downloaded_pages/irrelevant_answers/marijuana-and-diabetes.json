            "answer": "Hello LightBrown,I am also a type 1 diabetic with plenty of experience in the marijuana smoking department. I have had a lot of variable blood sugars while smoking marijuana and am pretty sure every person's response to marijuana, BG-wise, is different. Also, marijuana can sometimes lead to cravings for foods that are high in carbs and thus raise your sugar that way. If you have a regimen now that is working for you, with a sound diet and insulin in addition to any smoking that you're doing, that's great. I doubt you'll ever be able to get marijuana medically approved though, especially since there are therapies (insulin) that are proven to work for diabetes management. And you'll have a hard time convincing a doctor that you can afford the marijuana but not the insulin. So keep shooting for those good sugars but probably don't count on any kind of medical approval for an illegal drug.Good luck and I hope things work out well for you.",

            "answer": "I have had type I for 23 years. I have been thru it all. Camp Sweeny and everything (which is the best camp you can send your child) probably why I understand and know how to treat my disease so effectively. Even while parting and drinking and smoking in my younger days, there were key lessons I learned to survive without proper tools such as insulin and bg meter. Main thing being diet! I got use to low carbs and no sugar at age 10. However I have smoked since I was 15 and still do and it has done nothing medicinal for my diease. Only time it helps me is when I can't eat.....but that's it.\u00a0\u00a0What I want to know is are you guys testing your bg b4, while and after you smoke to know that its more stable? I have a pump and glucose senor and I can see the 24 hr reports of my sugar. No change on my graph when I smoke?",
