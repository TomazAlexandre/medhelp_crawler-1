            "answer": "Hi!The symptoms could be due to cubital tunnel syndrome, in which the ulnar nerve is compressed at the elbow. This causes numbness of pinky finger and that side of ring finger along with pain on the inner side of forearm. Treatment is usually through physiotherapy.Hypothyroidism, diabetes, tumors and infections of the ulnar and spinal nerves and rheumatism can all cause numbness of little and ring finger. Please consult a neurologist. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
