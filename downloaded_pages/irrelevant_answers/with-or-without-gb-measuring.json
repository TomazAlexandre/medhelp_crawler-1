            "answer": "Yes that gives me some hope. I just can't wait for appt. I don't want baby getting so large. And of course if I had gb then I want to try to correct it as soon as possible. Have u consistently measured higher too? Even at my ultrasound at 21 wks, they thought baby may weigh a little more but I knew that wasn't always accurate so I didn't get disturbed until they thought I measured high.",

    "question": "I was measuring 28 cm at 23+5.... which is like 3-4 weeks ahead apparently? I am now 27 weeks today and two days ago I measured myself at 31 cm. Really hope I don't have gestational diabetes.... I don't get glucose test till I am 28+6.... So ready. Want the doctor to do another ultrasound because it worries me that baby is growing too fast. I started at 110 And I am 5'1. I've gained 25 lbs... 5 of those in just the last two weeks!? what the heck!? :/ at my last appointment she was shocked my uterus measured higher than she expected but she said maybe I had a growth spurt.. but clearly it's not slowing down. What are you measuring and how far along? With our without GB? This is my first baby. Am I crazy or are these measurements pretty high? From researching it seems average measurements should match weeks at this point...thanks.",
