            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The feeling of something on the hands can be due to paraesthesia or altered sensation. Old age with menopause is another reason. Diabetic neuropathy is the third reason and quite possible as her blood sugars are high. Very dry skin on hand could be another cause. Apply a good moisturizer and see. Also get her liver and kidney function assessed.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
