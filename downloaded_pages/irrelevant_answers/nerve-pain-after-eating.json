            "answer": "\"What would cause my feet to hurt after eating?\"How soon after eating do you feel the pain? What are your postprandial levels? If I amp up over 175 mg/dl postprandial I get airplane feet [prickly/tingling], a warning sign from my body.\"My diabetes is under control and my blood sugar numbers and A1C are perfect (5.9).\"An A1c of 5.9% equates to a daily glucose average of 123 mg/dl, not 'perfect'. Perfect would be between 4-5%.Have you seen a Neurologist? He/she can also refer you to a pain management specialist. Daily 30 - 60 minute exercise helps blood circulation. Walking is very good.",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for your prompt response.\u00a0\u00a0I went to my neurologist ten years ago because of painful feet and after an MRI turned up some white ischemic spots in my brain, I was given a spinal tap that ruled out MS, which was great since it runs in my famiy. At the time I had been a life long drinker of wine, mostly on weekends and quite a bit.\u00a0\u00a0Then I underwent a glucose tolerance test that resulted in 204, so I was determined to be a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I then quit drinking pretty much altogether as I figured that it wasn't good to continue since I was diabetic, and I had started to experience severe foot pain 12 hours after each drinking escapade. This hasn't helped at all with my other pain issues, unfortunately.\u00a0\u00a0I forgot to mention that I also take one januvia in the am because before I started on it my post prandial numbers were around 250.\u00a0\u00a0After starting on it a few years ago, they are usually around 120.\u00a0\u00a0The strange thing is that my feet will hurt after a meal, sometimes minutes and sometimes hours afterward, and when I test my blood, my numbers are always about 120.\u00a0\u00a0It's the weirdest thing.\u00a0\u00a0Even eating something like ice cream, which will make my feet hurt immediately, does not cause my numbers to skyrocket.\u00a0\u00a0I've been seeing a neurologist for ten years and have had numerous emgs that show just mild to moderate peripheral neuropathy but my pain says otherwise.\u00a0\u00a0I've even been to the U of WA diabetes clinic and they determined that diabetes is not the cause of my neuropathy, but the UW neurology clinic thought otherwise.\u00a0\u00a0After an extensive emg they just told me I had axonal neuropathy and to keep taking the neurontin. It has me stumped since my feet will hurt even when it's been hours since I ate anything.\u00a0\u00a0Have you ever heard of such a thing?When I last went in for toe surgery my feet hurt and my fasting glucose was 90.\u00a0\u00a0They asked if I was sure I was even diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I have pretty numb feet and since I grip with my toes I have had severe toe problems that have required two surgeries on each great toe.\u00a0\u00a0Podiatrist says I have Charcot foot but not the disease.\u00a0\u00a0P.S. I am 64 and just retired as a high school teacher.\u00a0\u00a0Oh, and my blood test results of last week show my cholesterol as being 285, which I know is very high, but I can't tolerate statins at all.\u00a0\u00a0Haven't been able to get much exercise lately what with the latest two toe operations since July and the second of two total knee replacements last Valentine's Day.\u00a0\u00a0I just need some help figuring out this foot pain trouble.\u00a0\u00a0There just has to be a better way than my doctor's solution of taking 3000 mg a day of neurontin. Thanks again.\u00a0\u00a0Joyce",

            "answer": "\"try not to have your glucose spike more than 145 after meal,I mean ONE HOUR pp, not 2 or 3 hrs which is not correct.\"Postprandial is defined as 2-3 hours after/post a meal, when glucose plateaus in the bloodstream. Thus, it serves as a test of whether a person may have diabetes, or of whether a person who has diabetes is successfully controlling their glucose levels. At 1 hour glucose is still on the rise not providing an accurate assessment. Another example is an OGTT for diabetes screening, the most important sample is the 2 hour sample.Fradybrady - Consistent high cholesterol not only affects your cardio system but can create poor circulation. Are you aware a misbehaving thyroid disrupts not only insulin production but also is one of many causes of poor circulation? Another thought is food allergies...is it all foods or certain foods and/or food groups that cause the pain? Sorry, I wish I had something better to say but axonal neuropathy and Charcot foot are beyond my means.",
