            "answer": "Hi, there are a few conditions that cause excessive thirst in a cat that's over 7 yrs old-diabetes, kidney disease, and thyroid disease.\u00a0\u00a0All 3 of these conditions will also cause weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0Kidney disease will cause vomiting.\u00a0\u00a0Both thyroid(over active thyroid) and diabetes will cause an excessive appetite.If you decide to take your cat to the vet, please request blood work and a urinalysis to check for these conditions.\u00a0\u00a0If you decide to check for diabetes, you should with-hold food from her for 10 hrs before you take her.\u00a0\u00a0If you do that, the vet will be able to test her right away for diabetes.Good luck!!",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for your help. She is not vomiting so I can probably rule out kidney. Is there a treatment for the others? She has been eating a lot more lately. I am currently in Florida for the winter and her Vet is back home up north. Is this something I should have checked right away or can it wait til I get back? How dangerous is both of these to her?",

            "answer": "OHHHHH, I am sorry-I should've included all of that!!\u00a0\u00a0OOPS!!\u00a0\u00a0={ALL of these conditions are treatable!!\u00a0\u00a0That is really great!\u00a0\u00a0But, if left untreated, these conditions can be very very dangerous.\u00a0\u00a0Since, you said she's not vomiting, then I'm leaning more toward diabetes or hyperthyroid disease.\u00a0\u00a0It's more likely diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes can damage the kidneys if it's left untreated.\u00a0\u00a0I am very concerned for her right now because of all of the water she's drinking.\u00a0\u00a0PLEASE do not wait until you get home.\u00a0\u00a0If you take her to the vet, get copies of all the tests that are run on her to bring with you to your vet at home.\u00a0\u00a0Please do not delay.Also, do some research on the internet to educate yourself about diabetes, hyperthyroid disease, and kidney disease.\u00a0\u00a0Knowledge is power.",
