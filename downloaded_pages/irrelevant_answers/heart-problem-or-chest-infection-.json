    "question": "I\u2019m 23, married and up until recently I have been in full health.Last week, I had been out with my horse for a couple of hours, when all of a sudden, out of no where, I had the awfullest chest pain! It felt like something was crushing my entire chest, a tightness like a vice, something indescribable. The pain moved to between my shoulder blades and in my upper back. As I walked back to the house everything began to ease itself, however, by the time I got home I felt really dizzy, my husband thought it best to drive to the nearest hospital and see what they had to say.My heart rate was very high (ranging from 130 to 160) and so was my blood pressure (189/95). However because I am so young they told me to come back tomorrow and have an ECG, adding that they doubted anything was truly wrong because of my age. The next day I still wasn't feeling the best in fact the pain returned but this time gradually over about an hour, by the time my ECG appointment came around I was almost used to it. However, when the doctor saw my date of birth he simply told me to go home and said, \u201cLook you probably have a chest infection. Go home.\u201d We did and its been a week, I feel a little better, pain wise, but I am just so tired, the real issue is that over the last week I have noticed that my feet and ankles have swelled, not a lot just enough for my husband to notice without me telling him, (knowing him, thats pretty clear that its swollen). And just in the last week I have almost fainted twice.I will admit I have a really bad family history of health issues. My mother and both of her parents have had heart attacks, my fathers family all have cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes running through their family and my older brother, who is only 30, had a major stroke last year. My younger sister, who is 22, was diagnosed with breast cancer early this year, my aunts and uncles all have diabetes.I know that I need to visit my doctor but I just don't know what to say to them. Could I have a heart problem, after all it dose run in my family? Could I really have a chest infection? What about my swollen feet? Do you see it? Do I even go to my doctor? Help me out here.",
