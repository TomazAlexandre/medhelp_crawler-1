            "answer": "Hi, There,I know how you must be feeling, and how concerned you are about your father-in-law, but don't jump to conclusions so readily. About a year ago my Creatine level jumped up over 140 (must be a different scale). One doctor said I had advanced Chronic Kidney Disease, and that I would be on dialysis in 5~10 years. I went to another doctor who did a blood check for a kidney or bladder infection, and sure enough I had one. He prescribed penicillin for two weeks and my creatinine level has remained consistently at around 110 for a year now. Some doctors, use creatinine levels too strictly for making diagnoses for CKD when there are often other factors. Please make sure another factor is not causing the elevated levels. An untreated acute infection could turn serious, as well, if not treated.Elevated levels are a strong indication CKD, but are by no means, a definite tool for diagnosis.Hope that helps!",
