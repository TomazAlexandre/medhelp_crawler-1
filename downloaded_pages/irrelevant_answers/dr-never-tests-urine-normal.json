            "answer": "I am pretty sure that is kind of standard to check it. It helps to check for sugar and protien in the urine which are indicators of gestational diabetes and preclampsia (which I'm sure you already know). Perhaps some docs wait til later in a pregnancy to test for those things, but I'd think you are far enough along now that they would want to check. I would probably just ask the nurse the next time you go why they aren't checking your urine. Mine gets checked each time for protien, glucose and then they check for a UTI for me b/c I am prone to them this pregnancy. (yay me) lol",

            "answer": "With my last pregnancy, my midwife checked my urine every visit. With this pregnancy and my OB, he started checking I think at like my 32nd week and then I've given a sample since then. I too thought this was really wierd, and even asked the nurse. She said the other doc in the practice gets one at every visit, but it was just style and choice and mine didn't worry about it unless something else was going on until the last two week visits and beyond.",

            "answer": "Most probably do get a sample every time, but in actuality it probably isn't necessary.\u00a0\u00a0You will be tested for gest. diabetes regardless of what the urine shows (if you are spilling sugar or not), and your blood pressure checks will show if you might be developing pregnancy induced hypertension--in which case the appropriate blood tests will be ordered for that.Women can spill glucose and/or protein in their urine and it might not mean a thing...and vice versa.\u00a0\u00a0So while urine checks are usually done, it's probably more from routine than from necessity.\u00a0\u00a0Years ago, that was the best way to check.\u00a0\u00a0Now there are better diagnostics, but old habits die hard.",

The only time I have had my urine checked was when I was having UTI symptoms and now I am on Macrobid for the rest of the pregnancy for them. This is very different from my last pregnancies, but I am treating in a different location now. My OB doc has been in the field for a long time and I think her take on it is just that pregnancy is a normal process and unless there are problems, to let it happen naturally. She doesn't do a whole lot of checking for things or testing so if she doesn't worry, I guess I don't.",
