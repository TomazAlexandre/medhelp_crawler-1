            "answer": "I'm not a doctor, just a voluanteer and a type 1 diabetic, so you and your father should talk to his doctor.Having said that, if your dad is frequently having hypoglycemia he needs to let his primary care physician and his endochronoligist know. Good control prevents high and low blood sugar levels. He may be taking too much insulin, or not eating enough carbohydrates with his meals. If he's taking two shots a day, he's likely on a blend of long acting and short acting insulin, such as Novolin 70/30. There may be other insulin therapies available for him that will give him better control.Talking with a a diabetes health educator may also be beneficial, so that he knows how much insulin to take with a particular meal. The next time you go visit him for a few days, try to have him schedule a medical appointment during your stay. Then you can go with him and let the doctor know about your anxiety.John",

            "answer": "I agree that your dad probably needs to be encouraged to test his glucose levels much more often than he used to since he is now taking insulin. It is not uncommon for an insulin-dependent person to test their glucose levels every 2-3 hours throughout the day. Doing this helps the patient see for real when glucose levels are rising or falling too low rather than this person having to rely on how he or she feels. It really may be the key to protecting your father. If he tests this often, he can probably catch lows before they get dangerous.",

    "question": "My 76 year old, live alone, father passes out frequently enough for me to have phoned paramedics; 1 time long distance - I'm in AZ, he's in Fl, and 2x in person during vacation.He says he does not know when these episodes are coming on.He takes two shots a day; 1 in a.m., and 1 in p.m..Here are my questions:1.\u00a0\u00a0What are the consequences of passing out alone?2.\u00a0\u00a0At what blood-sugar level does coma, brain damage, death occur?He seems to think (I do not know if it is from his own experience - he won't tell me) that, after a while of being \"out\" his body will recover naturally, he'll know what has happened and he'll eat something.I was with him 3 weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0I found him passed out, his body was absolutely rigid, his breathing was deep and strong and his heart was pounding.\u00a0\u00a0After phoning 911, I held him and in a short while his body relaxed, his breathing became more normal, and his heart stopped pounding.\u00a0\u00a0I thought he was slowly passing away.Then the paramedics arrived.\u00a0\u00a0His sugar was 20.\u00a0\u00a0The paramedics administered a glucose I.V., and my Dad recovered instantly.\u00a0\u00a0I fed him a big meal and we continued with our 4 day visit.I am very very worried about him.Thank you for answering my questions.",
