            "answer": "Please do NOT brush your teeth with lemon juice.\u00a0\u00a0Lemon juice is acidic and any acidic foods will soften the enamel on your teeth which can lead to damage of the actual tooth.\u00a0\u00a0Sugar cane and all types of sugar too, can damage teeth.You can however, use Bicarbonate of Soda.\u00a0\u00a0This is in most toothpastes anyway.Make sure though that you do brush your teeth in the morning and again before bedtime as well as floss the gums every day.\u00a0\u00a0Gum disease can loosen the teeth and the teeth can just drop out - I've seen this happen.Make sure that you drinks lots of water.\u00a0\u00a02 litres is usually recommended, but you may need to drink more if you sweat a lot.Bad breath can come from bad teeth, unhealthy gums, throat problems, if you have mucus around your throat, from stomach problems.\u00a0\u00a0If you eat strongly flavoured foods, garlic for example, that too will give you a bad breath.\u00a0\u00a0Stomach problems can give you bad breath.I used to smell that type of smell from my mother's mouth and she was a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0So it may be a good idea to get checked out for any signs of diabetes.Eating fresh parsley is said to help with breath problems.",
