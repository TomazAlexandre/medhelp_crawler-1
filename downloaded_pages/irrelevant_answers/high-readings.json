            "answer": "\"What cause high sugar readings without having diabetes?\"Not enough information in your post to answer properly. When exactly are the times these \"sugar readings\" are taking place? Makes a big difference if it was first thing in the morning before he had anything to eat or drink, or directly after meals. Also, make, model of glucose meter and how often it is calibrated. Has he been tested at a doctor's office? When? And what were the results?",

            "answer": "High blood sugar,\u00a0\u00a0if this is what your husband has, ARE a sign of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0They are usually not a sign of anything else (unless someone is sick or on steroids, in which case levels can be temporarily high).Initially they can be the only obvious sign, which is why it is so important that people have diabetes screening at their annual checkups.Your husband should be looking into this with his doctor further and taking appropriate steps to manage\u00a0\u00a0it.Likely this can be very effective seeing it has been caught before he has any bad effects from it.",

            "answer": "\"My husband has high arsenic so I wonder if your blood can change with these metals.\"One research said, \"The pandemic of arsenic poisoning due to contaminated groundwater in West Bengal, India, and all of Bangladesh has been thought to be limited to the Ganges Delta (the Lower Ganga Plain).\" They also said, \"Arsenic induced type 2 diabetes depends on concentration of arsenic, arsenic compound, time of exposure, biological model.\" Will lowering the arsenic levels\u00a0\u00a0lower his blood glucose levels?. Only a competent Endocrinologist working in conjunction with an Epidimologist [see below] can answer this question.\"We cannot get help even if we pay for it, no one can find the problem.\"This makes no sense. If your husband has been diagnosed with high levels of arsenic, there are known ways to treat it, one is Chelation treatment. Here is a link to the UK's UCL, The Department of Epidemiology and Public Health. They may assist you with locating an Epidemologist near you, one that specializes in chemical poisoning. http://www.ucl.ac.uk/epidemiology/",
