            "answer": "That is discrimination. There was a law passed a long time ago that just because someone has diabetes and other diseases, they cannot be fired. It is not a good enough reason and for getting your checkups it should be the company getting theirs! It used to be for me years ago that companies would not hire me. It's much the same with that law. Perhaps contact the ADA and find out who you can contact to let them know what is going on.",
