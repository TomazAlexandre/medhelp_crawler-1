            "answer": "If you live in the U.S. I'm going to assume that 6.9 is an A1C. I'm not sure why you think that is \"not diabetic\"\u00a0\u00a0because it is. Anything over 6.0 is considered diabetes. Please talk with your doctor and get him to clarify which Type you are. He can do an antibody test and a c-peptide which will clarify this. It is important to know how to treat you to be sure of your Type. Then make sure he schedules you to meet with a diabetic educator so you can learn about management of your diabetes. I'm sorry to bring you this information, but diabetes is a manageable condition and the more you learn the better you will do.",

            "answer": "Yes, the reading can most certainly rise that much in 18 months. 6.9 is definitely a diabetic level, but not extremely high. What is important is to have your Type diagnosed and to learn how to manage your diabetes to keep it under control. There is a lot you can do towards that end but you will have to learn about it after your Type is clarified. Let us know how your appointment goes with your doctor Monday.",

You now mention that you live in Canada and that this was a fasting blood sugar. That is entirely different, because 6.9 is equivalent to 124 which is, in fact \"pre-diabetes\" not diabetes. This is the reason you have to be very clear communicating if you seek information on an internet website!I have no idea about the STD situation and what if any relevance it has to pre-diabetes..none probably. You said you have a doctor's appointment tomorrow so that is the time to write down any questions you have and make sure you are clear on exactly what the doctor is recommending.",

I'm sorry that I led you astray by saying you were over the line to be diagnosed. For fasting blood sugar the standards are: Under 100-non-diabetic, 100-125 pre-diabetes and 126+ diabetes. Since your number 6.9 is equivalent to 124 (multiply by 18) you are just under the line. As your doctor will tell you it will be very important for you to change your eating patterns, exercise and lose any excess weight to slow down or prevent the progression to diabetes. Once you meet with your doctor I suggest you do more research and find a website with more traffic where you can learn from other people how to manage pre-diabetes. Good luck to you.",
