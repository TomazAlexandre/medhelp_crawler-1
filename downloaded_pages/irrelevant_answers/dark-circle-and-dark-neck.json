            "answer": "HiDark pigmentation on the skin especially involving the neck, the inner thighs and the arm pits may be due to hormonal imbalance. If there are associated weight problems and adrenal problems, then dark skin pigmentations may present. If this has been present for quite some time already, then you may need to have this assessed by an internist. An endocrinology referral may be necessary.Apply vitamin E cream over the dark areas. Do not rub or scrub vigorously. This may thicken the skin. Mildly exfoliate from time to time.How old are you?Do you have any associated conditions like diabetes?",
