            "answer": "Hi!There are many other causes of nerve disorder causing paresthesia or abnormal sensations on your scalp as you are feeling including diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism. Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Nerve infections as in lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi,About three years ago i was doing this exercise I read about in a magazine to help me get rid of scalp inflammation. It involved bringing the eyebrows up and then pushing the head back. I was doing all day because the inflammation was annoying for maybe a month or so and during it I felt something tearing up around my scalp but i stupidly a. Then one day after about a month of doing it something felt very out of place in my head and its gotten worse during the three years since. It feels like something there is only partially attached and it is always moving around. Its basically all over the surface of my head besides my face. Just feels physically out of place and sometimes it feels as if tiny strings holding things together are pulling apart. Also sometimes an area just vibrates and throbs for a few minutes and it feels like some string is unraveling. CT scan comes back only with sinus polyp but not in the one on top of the head. Its really ruining my life. Can anyone suggest what it is and what further tests I can do? Thanks very much.",
