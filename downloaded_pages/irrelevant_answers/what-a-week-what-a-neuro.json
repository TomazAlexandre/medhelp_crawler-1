If the results are really high, I test again before dinner, and adjust what I eat. The prednison will raise blood sugar. Did he put you on any medication? If he didn't, checking your blood sugar won't do anything except give you sore fingers, LOL. Ask his nurse, they are usually better relating what you should do than the doctors are. That God for good nurses. They see the reality of patients much more than the lord high almighty doctors do. Good luck, let us know how you are doing........Maggie",

A person suffering from simple/harmless/primary staged hypokalemia may experience no symptoms at all, but general symptoms of hypokalemia are:FatiguePatient may experience problems such as Myalgia and muscular weaknessPatient may experience hyponatremia and also may experience confused i.e. anxiety.Acme problemSkin related problems such as blistering, skin eruptions, dryness of skin etc.Temporary memory loss or problems such as weak memory etc.Patient is prone to heart related problems, such as heart deterioration.Digestive system also may get affected due to potassium deficiency leading to hypertension, improper sleep, nervous system deterioration, depression, constipation etc.In some cases patient may experience ringing/noise in ear.I don't understand why your doc that came to see you wouldn't clue into that and I would mention it to him/her the next time you speak to them.\u00a0\u00a0My neuro said that the amount of potassium contained in a banana would suffice and taking a supplement may be too much which can in turn cause a potassium overdose which apparently is not good either!If you don't like banana's, like me, I can't stand the things, try to eat lot's of potatoes and google other sources of potassium ok?I am pretty sure that if you increase your potassium to a higher lever you will start to feel a whole lot better.Let me know what happens ok?Lots of Hugs,Rena",
