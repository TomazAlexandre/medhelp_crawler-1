            "answer": "you dont have pancreatic cancer. If you did, you'd be dead already. Sorry to be blunt, but usually pancreatic cancer kills a person in like 6 months. So since you've had these symptoms for a year, well, you're still alive, so you don't have cancer.Dont pay attention to what you see online. go to those sites and put in any symptom and it will show cancer as a possibility.Fatty liver disease is no joke. thats probably what you have, so change your diet accordingly and lose the weight like your doctor said and you should feel better.",

    "question": "Hello. I m a 22 years male. I don t smoke or drink i don t have diabetes and no one in my family had ever got cancer . I weigh about 130kg and I m 180cm tall. It starts when i noticed my stool was a bit light in color. At first i didn t think much of it and it didn t change for about a year now. Then i read on the Internet that it could be pancreatic cancer so i got really scared. I went to the doctor and did some tests. Liver enzymes (ALT/AST) were elevated (140/58). Total bilirubin was 1 ( normal >1.2) and conjugated bilirubin was 0. And traces of bile pigments were found in the urine. Then i did an abdominal ultrasound and was told that I have a fatty liver and everything else is normal . Doctor told me that the elevated liver enzymes are common in fatty liver disease. And told me to lose weight and don t eat fat and that there is no way that I have pancreatic cancer. It was a relief for me. But now i started to get scared again and i check for symptoms every hour. Can anyone tell me according to these information, is it possible that I have pancreatic cancer?",
