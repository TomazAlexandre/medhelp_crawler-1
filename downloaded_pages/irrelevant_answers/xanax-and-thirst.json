            "answer": "Xanax don't dry the mouth out in that way at all. I have been taken 3 a day ( 1mg ) for years now. I could simply chew on one. No real side effects from them at all. Have been on other tablets in the past and the mouth would dry up in no time at all after taken one. That's why I love xanax so much. Lack of side effects with them. But everybody is different. Were I don't experience dry mouth, you just might. If you down in one go I seriously can't see it been the tablet. Some amount of water as well. I have never had to even drink half a cup because of xanax.",

    "question": "Hi,I've been taking xanax as needed for a few years now. For most of that time I've taken it once or twice a week. Lately, things have gotten out of hand, and I've been taking it nearly every day (have an appt. with MD next week to discuss an SSRI). The thing is, I notice that I've very thirsty these days - like 10-12 cups a day and my mouth is still dry. Hass anyone else has this side effect?",
