            "answer": "The CA 19-9 has a relatively low specificity, meaning there are a variety of conditions that can elevate the level.\u00a0\u00a0This can include gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, diverticulitis, liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and any acute or chronic inflammatory state.A colonoscopy can be considered to exclude colon cancer, and a cystoscopy performed to evaluate for bladder cancer.These options can be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patients education only.

    "question": "Just to give you a more complete medical history -\u00a0\u00a0I have a history of 3 thyroid nodules which we are watching. I have had 2 biopsies, all benign so far. All thyroid blood tests are normal, so I'm not on medication of any kind.\u00a0\u00a0 I just had a thyroid ultrasound and the nodules are the same size.\u00a0\u00a0I just had a CBC done.\u00a0\u00a0All tests were normal. I have had occult blood in the urine fluctuating from 2+ to 4+ for 8 years and have had an urography and 2 cystoscopies done. It seems to be idiopathic.\u00a0\u00a0I also had the CEA and CA 19-9 blood tests done, but the CA 19-9 was 10 points above normal.\u00a0\u00a0I just had a complete abdominal sonogram done and all was normal except for a small medular renal cyst which has not changed in 4 months.\u00a0\u00a0I feel fine.\u00a0\u00a0I understand the CA 19-9 is a test for pancreatic or gall bladder cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Is is a marker for any other organ?\u00a0\u00a0Should I worry that this is above normal range even if it's low? What would be the next step?\u00a0\u00a0Watching and waiting to see if something develops is very hard.",
