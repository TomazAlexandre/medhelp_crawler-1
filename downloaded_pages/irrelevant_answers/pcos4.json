            "answer": "PCOS isn\u2019t like a sickness\u2026it\u2019s more of an accumulation of disorders caused by a hormone defect. Cysts grow on the ovaries that produce testosterone (male hormone) and in turn, that creates an array of problems. Insulin resistance or diabetes, obesity, male patter hair growth and irregular periods are just a few of the most common symptoms. Women can have some or even all of these things. If you suspect you may have PCOS, you need to ask your doctor. Getting a simple blood test done to check your hormone levels can allow them to make the right diagnosis. To answer your questions, no, PCOS isn\u2019t related to discharge of any sort. Also, it is common for women to experience pain with PCOS; usually associated with the cysts, but then again, it is also common that they don\u2019t. I would talk to your doctor and find out for sure. A good book I would recommend is \u201cPCOS: The Hidden Epidemic\u201d it is very informative and may answer some more of your questions. Good luck!",
