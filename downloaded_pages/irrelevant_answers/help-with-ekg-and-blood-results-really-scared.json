            "answer": "Causes of decreased CO2 is metabolic acidosis, diabetes, sleep apnea, severe diarrhea and may indicate a need for thiamine (B1). I've had metabolic acidosis due to acute kidney failure taking magnesium supplements.\u00a0\u00a0Even two years later my pH is very acidic. Insulin had damaged my kidney to some degree.Junk food = high carb diet. High carb diets increase insulin. This is the perfect recipe for obesity and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a050% of diabetics will die of heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0Measure hip to waist ratio. A high ratio is typical of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance may or may not show up on lab results. Fat doesn't make you fat but you can bet high insulin does.",

    "question": "History: 28 year old female smoker, who is overweight and eating healthy now. HOwever ate fast food every day for 4 years stright due to pretty severe depression :(Has had chest pains for months, but now, with the added stressors of a divorce and work, has constant pain in her breastbone as well as on the left side of it, sometimes going into the back of neck, shoulder, and arm. Has went to the doc and er alot, had ekgs done. Had a alightly elevated troponin 2 weeks ago (troponin1 0.02, normal is under 0.04) but is back down to 0 as far as she knows. However her chest pain gets worse at night is is now there constantly. Ok blood pressure. Hardly ever goes over 130/85ish. Has high pulse that can go up to 120 all the time, but also has hypochondria and panic disorder.Please help me...I have a history of heart problems and stroke in my family and I am afraid my arteries are clogged up from eating fast food for so long...here is my last doctors report from 2 weeks ago, i will highlight the parts i am concerned about in bold....We have opted to check an EKG, which revealed normal sinus rhythm ata rate of 74 beats per minute. She had narrow QRS complex. Normal R-wave progression and no evidence of acute ischemic change. She had somenonspecific ST wave flattening in her inferior leads. This was comparedto previous EKG dated 03/19/2013 and was very similar.THen the labs taken that day.She had positive orthostatic vitalsigns by heart rate and greater than 20 points elevation when she stood.The patient's electrolytes were normal except for a mildly elevatedchloride of 110. Serum CO2 slightly low at 17. BUN and creatininewere normal. Liver function tests normal. Cardiac enzymes normal. C-reactive protein minimally elevated at 1.7, very similar to previous.White count 10.6. Hemoglobin, hematocrit and platelet count normal,differential without left shift. Sed rate normal at 20.THis was like two weeks ago, and that CO2 level keeps going down. what does that mean? Also my troponin I had gone up to 0.02 but is 0 now.. I am terrified of this pain...docs keep saying its stress and anxiety but I hesitate to believe them because I feel like all they wanna do is blame my anxiety...please help me!",
