            "answer": "Hi,Arachnoid cysts are cerebrospinal fluid-filled sacs that are located between the brain or spinal cord and the arachnoid membrane. They are benign cysts that occur in midline in relation to the arachnoid membrane and do not communicate with the ventricular system. Patients usually are asymptomatic even if the cyst is quite large. MRI is the diagnostic procedure of choice. Patients usually are asymptomatic even if the cyst is quite large.Any signs suggestive of raised intra-cranial tension like vomiting, headache, visual disturbances, irritability should alert you to visit a neurologist at earliest.I think you need to evaluate further on cause of tingling and numbness all over body like Diabetes, Prediabetes or VitB12 deficiency.Yes serial monitoring of cyst by successive scanning is important part of management.Hope this helps.Bye.",

These symptoms also get worse when i breathe heavily.\u00a0\u00a0I got an MRI done recently and there was an incidental finding of an arachnoid cyst measuring 5 cm in size in the cerebellum. It has been diagnosed asymptomatic but i still suffer from the above mentioned condition.Are there any other tests that can be performed, should i ask my doctor to monitor the growth of my cyst. He says it is pressing on the cerebellum but he also said that this is the first time the symptoms have presented themselves, i am 32 years old and never had anything of this nature ever before.I admit i am a little scared but my symptoms still persist.Please advise as i am highly confused and waht should be my next steps.",
