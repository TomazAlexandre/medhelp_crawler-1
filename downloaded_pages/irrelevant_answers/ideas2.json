            "answer": "Hi,There are a number of things that could be causing your symptoms. Don't be too quick to assume they are caused by the same thing. Instead look at the symptoms separately first and then try to determine if there is a common link between the two. The numbness and tingling very well could be related to your back issues, but it could also be attributed to something else. The metallic taste in your mouth could be a result of anemia. I would recommend that you request a follow up appointment with your physician after your testing is complete. I am not a physician but I do not believe that you have to worry about MS as these are not solely related to that condition. I wish you the best of luck and hopefully you get some answers soon!",

    "question": "Hi, I'm a 35yr old male 6'2\" 205lbs. About a month ago I started getting a weird taste in my mouth (sort of like a pill taste, maybe metallic not sure) I thought maybe allergies. Anyway a little over a week ago I started having numbness/ tingling in bottoms of both feet and fingertips of both hands. I went to primary and he ordered blood tests for vitamin deficiencies, zinc, lyme and thyroid problems. All these are normal with the exception of zinc which lab report just says \"test not performed\". My doctor also ordered MRI of head and sinuses, EMG/NCV and EEG. I'm still waiting for these tests to be done. I thought maybe diabetes or my very bad back (lots of slipped discs L5 pressing on S1 nerve) but dr. said no to both. My questions are: what are these tests looking for? does this sound like MS?",
