            "answer": "Temporary movement disorders as well as permanent ones can come from an antipsychotic. Think if you are taking other medications as well or have done so in the past. Lithium can't cause this effect but it can worsen temporary movement disorders such as akathesia from an antipsychotic because it raises the blood levels of them. I know because it happenned to me and my psychopharmocologist explained it. Temporary movement disorder can be treated with a side effect pill.",

    "question": "I think my lithium for bp 2 is causing me to twitch and jerk mostly when in a relaxed state. It bothers me, I try to keep if from happening then it almost seems to build up and then comes out all at once and so I jerk and twitch more then before I tried to stop it. I tried to mention it to my meds lady but she don't seem to listen to me any more, I don't like that she don't. Any ideas, any help is welcomed.",
