            "answer": "Thank-you for posting your question as I think many people misunderstand the low carbohydrate dieting. First off, Carbohydrates are our immediate energy and so without it you will probably feel like you are constantly \"hitting the wall\" and leaving your body in fatigue, dehydration (which gives the illusion of weight loss), energy loss, and excessive protein breakdown with a buildup of ketones in the body. Protein is NOT used for energy it is the building blocks of the body ie. nails, hair, muscles, tissues etc. If there is a lack of carbs, the body uses protein which prevents the proteins from doing its job, building and repairing tissues. Fats are needed for formation of cell membranes and synthesise fundamental chemicals, help transport vitamins A,D, E, and K.Instead of cutting out carbohydrates, eat high fibre foods as well as low glycemic index foods as they slow the digestion of the body's carbohydrates. Also, eat carbohydrates with fats and proteins as that will also slow the absorption of your food.Jen",

            "answer": "Welcome to the WL&D Community and THANK YOU for posting this important question.\u00a0\u00a0Jen has given you some great information and I agree with the information she has given.Carbohydrates can be both good and bad.\u00a0\u00a0Simple carbohydrates and carbohydrates from sugary processed foods are not the best choices.\u00a0\u00a0They digest quickly, cause a rapid influx in sugar and then abruptly drops you causing a loss of energy and causing our bodies to call for more fuel ... that can lead to run to more carbs and get caught up in a viscious cycle ... or to over-eating/binge type episodes.Complex carbohydrates, such as whole grain breads, brown rice and pasta are higher in fiber and digest slower.\u00a0\u00a0If used as part of a balanced diet, these types of carbohydrates (and occasionally a few of the others)\u00a0\u00a0are quite acceptable and in most diets much needed.If you need any help in portion sizes or in a selection of your carbohydrates, please post another question and the members of this community will be thrilled to offer their assistance.Very best wishes .. and truly hope you stay involved with us ... we're very happy you're here!",
