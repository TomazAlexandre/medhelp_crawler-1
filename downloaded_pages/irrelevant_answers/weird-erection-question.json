            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to erectile dysfunction. The causes are many like diabetes, depression, autonomic nervous system problem, excessive alcohol ingestion or tobacco smoking etc. You may need to consult your doctor to see which amongst these causes are responsible for your problem. The commonly prescribed drug by the doctors is sildenafil, which causes erections to be stronger and long lasting. It is not safe to take this drug without doctor\u2019s advice.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "When I first hurt my **** at 21, that goofy head thing happened to me every erection for say 7 years. Drs did NOTHING for me.it happened cause I put a pin ***** laceration, left cavernosa; bled it good (ie bad); obsessive dosing of alcohol for a week plus.My penis died but good. Ice cold and shrunken like a clitoris (I was very well endowed and copiously virile before that).After event, when hard...The head and top 1/3 didn't get hard at all--very bizarre looking: psychologically _traumatic_ for a 21 year old virgin.Stung in head and underside when hard or cumming; stung when soft and peeing --and bent urine stream real bad with post-pee drip bad.The underside of the penis --the \"spongiosum--which was always the secret of my particular virility, I believe --would not get hard for anything and stung.Problem lasted for over 10 years.That was 1992 --before viagra etc revolution.I believe some urethral antibiotics and a local injection of \"erection juice\" a few times would have pounded out the \"dent\" from the inside and helped to jump start me way back then; maybe a urethral \"balloon dilation\" would have pounded out the dent too and jump started things. But instead I was dismissed with a pat pat.Uros will do that to you too!Keep that in mind. Drs will pooh pooh you and dismiss you. Depending on the dr and your personality or ethnic type he could dismiss with prejudice. Be wary, young man: don't let them get away with it and take another life like they did mine.Go to my site a read MY STORY.",

    "question": "OK this is a weird question.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anyone out there know what might cause a partial erection.\u00a0\u00a0By this I don't mean that its not at full mast so to speak but that only half the shaft engorges fully. Kindof like a balloon animal balloon that's only half inflated.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone else ever had this happen?",
