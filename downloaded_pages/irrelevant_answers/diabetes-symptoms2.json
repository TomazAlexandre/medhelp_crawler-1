            "answer": "Sounds like you have a couple different medical things that might be going on and we here on this site aren't qualified to speak to them, but you say you had two fasting glucose tests. What were the results? Just saying it was \"fine\" doesn't give you much information. You need to know if it is in the normal, pre-diabetes or diabetes range. Also fasting glucose is not the test of choice anymore for diabetes, but the A1C is, and that takes the average of blood sugars for 2-3 months, not just one point in time like a fasting glucose. I encourage you to find out you fasting results and to get an A1C and find that out as well. Never accept a doctor saying it was \"fine\". Always request a copy of the lab results which tells you your number and the range for normal.",

            "answer": "Possibly. The tiredness, blurry vision, nightsweats, and infections COULD be symptoms of diabetes, but I don't know how your epilepsy could be influencing your symptoms. Only a doctor and a test can tell you for sure. You said you got the result for the first fasting test; do you know what the number was? Yes, ask for an A1C. Many doctors are not too educated on diabetes but that is pretty basic.",

    "question": "Hi I am a 42 year old female and I have been having a few problems lately. My toes started to go numb and was wakening me up in the night got blood done and folic acid was slightly low and was put on 3 months folic acid. went to see my nurse as I had a severe itch in my vagina round the part were you pass urine and the outsides was also suffering from tiredness blurry vision and sore legs she did some swabs which came back with an candida infection but wasnt the common one cant remember the name of the one. She also did glucose fasting test which was ok she was concerened that I was showing symptoms of Diabetes. The doc had to phone the lab to see what tablet to treat infection but said it was very expensive and gave me 2 courses of fluconaze I think thats what its called that was 6 weeks ago still up the wall with the itch also sweat quite bad at night in bed and I dont like sweet things prefer savoury but havent had much appetite just what to eat sweet things would rather have a cup of tea and chocolate or sweeties a thing I never ate. My grandmother and her father and brother were diabetic. I am worried going back to nurse on the 25th of this month and went and got a glucose fasting blood test again today.
