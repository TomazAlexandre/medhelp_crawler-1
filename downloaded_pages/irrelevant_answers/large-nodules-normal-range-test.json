            "answer": "First you should be aware that the AACE recommended over 6 years ago that the ref. range for TSH should be reduced from .5 - 5.0 down to .3 - 3.0.\u00a0\u00a0More importantly, TSH is a pituitary hormone that is affected by many variables and does not correlate very well at all with hypo symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0At best TSH is an indicator, to be considered along with more important indicators, which are symptoms (of which you have plenty), and the levels of the actual, biologically active thyroid hormones, which are free T3 and free T4 (note that yours is in the low end of its range).\u00a0\u00a0Also, be aware that FT3 and FT4 are very different from total T3 and total T4, which doctors usually test for.Free T3 is actually most important because it is four times as active as free T4, plus FT3 correlates best with hypo symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0In my opinion the best way to treat a thyroid patient is to test and adjust the levels of FT3 and FT4 with whatever meds are required to alleviate symptoms, withour being constrained by resultant TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0Frequently this requires adjusting FT3 into the upper part of its range, and FT4 to at least midpoint of its range.So you really need to go back and insist on being tested for FT3 and FT4 and then post results and reference ranges used by the lab, so that members can help interpret.\u00a0\u00a0 While you are there you might as well inquire if the doctor is willing to treat your symptoms as I have spelled out above.\u00a0\u00a0If not you might as well begin the search for a good thyroid doctor.",

            "answer": "Forgot to ask what the doctor said about the nodules and any further testing for that.\u00a0\u00a0If he said that you needed to see an Endo, then that will fit right into finding a good thyroid doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Just be aware that not all endos are good thyroid doctors.\u00a0\u00a0Many specialize in diabetes, not thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0You may have to resort to calling and asking to speak to a nurse and asking a few questions.\u00a0\u00a0You should ask if the doctor is willing to treat a patient's symptoms by testing and adjusting the levels of FT3 and FT4, without being constrained by resultant TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0If the answer is yes, then ask if the doctor is willing to prescribe thyroid meds other than a T4 type.\u00a0\u00a0If either answer is no, then you might as well keep looking.",
