            "answer": "I had the test done 8 weeks algo (I'm 35 now) and it turned out wrong, what meant a strict diet, checking my glucose levels every day and having insuline shots three times a day, before meals. It's not the same for everyone though, sometimes dieting is enough. Anyway, if you end up having gestational diabetes it'll be over once you deliver your baby, and you're very close now!",

            "answer": "Yes I had it with my first and again with this pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 35w 4d. I am controlling my sugars with just dieting but if your numbers get to high they will either do medicine or insulin shots to make sure your levels are good. I have to test my sugars 4 times a day- fasting one, 2 hours after bfast,\u00a0\u00a02 hours after lunch, 2 hours after dinner. Levels should be under 120 and under 90 for fasting. There's a chance for large babies with GD and other complications so that's why it's important to keep those sugars where there supposed to be. If you do fail the 3 hour you will then go see a dietician where they will tell you all about what u can eat and give you a glucose meter! Your almost done anyways most doctors do the 1 Hour at 28 weeks. Wish you luck and hope you pass",
