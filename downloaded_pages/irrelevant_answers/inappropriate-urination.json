            "answer": "hi Babs and Pasha and welcome.....your poor second hand kitty is probably quite stressed with the move and new home, so glad you are able to take him in and give him a loving home and care.I will send you a site with lots of info on 'inappropriate elimination' for some suggestions on what else could be bothering him.IMO it could well be crystals in the urine since he is MALE and this is very very common and very painful. when a cat is in pain peeing&/or defecating he will associate that with the litter box and refuse to use.He really needs a to see a Vet so they can get a urine sample from him....but it could also well be diabetes since you mentioned he is heavy AND he is peeing often...diabetes or CRF chronic renal failure.A vet will have to rule all these conditions out.Have you tried using a different litter to see if that works?sometimes even a change in the litter from what they are accustomed too will bring about refusal..here is the site, please post again with any updates or help you may need, all the best \u2665http://www.indianwalkvet.com/inappropriate_elimination.htm",

            "answer": "gosh thanks it has been a wild week since his diagnosis. turns out my dear boy has diabetes and i have been giving him insulin 2x daily for almost one week now. the urination is less and always appropriate. it is a steep learning curve for us both! i know he feels better and i finally am getting my head around such a serious illness. trying to get him to eat regular meals of canned food with no dry is a challenge. he misses crunchies and gobbles the canned. i have learned that his previous diet was high carb and probably contributed to his condition. i have found \"binkies list\" on the web and it has been a big help as well as learning how to inject cats. never thought id wish for the hairless variety but now! thanks to u opus. more when things settle, babshi to margypops",
