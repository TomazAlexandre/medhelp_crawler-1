            "answer": "There are dozens of physical foot pain reasons; poor fitting shoes, sprains, fractures, muscle strains, and so on. However, if you have uncontrolled and unmanaged diabetes and are also experiencing a tingling or burning sensation in your foot/feet, the cause could be from Peripheral Neuropathy, damage to a nerve or group of nerves. If left untreated it may lead to amputation. Go see your doctor for an examination. If necessary you may be referred to a Podiatrist and/or Neurologist for further evaluation. Good luck",
