    "question": "3 weeks ago I found out I had gestational diabetes so I would of been 26 weeks, last week I got sent to the hospital due to contractions I had no idea what was going on this is my first baby and I knew it was to early, so went to the birthing unit in the hospital and was admitted for 2 night 3 days and was told if they don't stop mycontractions iI will give both this week, they ended up stopping the contraction so I asked if theres anything that would of caused this (they knew about the diabetes ) and they said no there's nothing that causes it it just happens he just wants to see his mommy, so I left the hospital never worried about if this will happen again this early but it's been fine, I ended up having a diabetes appointment yesterday and they told me that because I have diabetes is why I went into labour and there's nothing toprevent it. So for all you moms who have gestational diabetes and have and signs of contractions even if you think there false PLEASE go to the hospital it may be the real thing !! It's really scary yes ! But it will be even more scary having your baby really early. I'm really sorry how long this was and my bad grammer.",
