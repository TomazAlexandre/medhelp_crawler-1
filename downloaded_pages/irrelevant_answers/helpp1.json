I control all my sugar numbers by diet except for my fasting number which I take a pill at night to keep my number steady while I sleep. My baby girl will be bigger even though I have only gained 10 pounds. I'm being induced due to gestational diabetes and gestational hypertension at 37 weeks. I'm currently 35 weeks.",

Next week I'll get an induction date as I am having a c section. Once you get a meal plan it's really very easy.
