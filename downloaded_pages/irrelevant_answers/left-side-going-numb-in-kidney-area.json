It is called \"Diabetic Kidney Disease\".Most Kidney Diseases attack the nephrons causing them to loose their filtering capacity. Damage to the nephrons can happen very fastly often due to posioning (even OTC meds) or trauma. But thegood news for you is... most Kidney Diseases destroy the nephrons SLOWLY and silently. I am sure you are keeping your Diabetes under control with meds. sooo we have to wait and see what the doc. says.Now don't get alarmed because we really don't know yet why you have the numbness. Have you had any disk or back injuries?? Do you have a Kidney doc??? Cara",
