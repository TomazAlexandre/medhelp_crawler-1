            "answer": "There is no 1 bloodtest for ALS/MS. Most people are Dx'd byruling out a series of bloodtests/brain & spine mri's. Eventhen, when you are at ofc., the Dr. can watch/listen to you todecide what next. You articulate well & your thoughts readclear. It would help you to know Dr's opinion & if mri wouldhelp Dx. Get copies for a hm-health-file on any tests. It may bea disk/nerve/RLS? I'd ask for a brain mri & see what response is. May need a neurologist. Gd-luck.",

    "question": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0About a month ago, my legs startless feeling strange...like they \"weren't working\".\u00a0\u00a0Felt like I was walking strange.\u00a0\u00a0(At times, would get muscle soreness for no reason)\u00a0\u00a0About a week ago, I woke up with foot muscle spasms...and since then, have had a constant bubbly feeling all over calves (and in front), sometimes in thighs, and a pins & needles/vibrating feeling all over both feet.\u00a0\u00a0This is constant, in both legs and both feet, although it bothers me most when sitting or lying down.\u00a0\u00a0I still feel like I walk funny.\u00a0\u00a0It's like my legs and feet are constantly being \"shocked\".\u00a0\u00a0As millions of others, I am so worried about ALS and MS.\u00a0\u00a0My glucose level today was 97, so doctor doesn't suspect diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Yet, she didn't seem concerned about this sudden onset of muscle twitching/vibrating.\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound to you like ALS?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your time.\u00a0\u00a0Holly",
