            "answer": "Hi,I have a few suggestions for him. Firstly, he should get his blood sugar checked as he\u2019s urinating frequently and this is one of the earliest signs of diabetes. Also diabetes can decrease the sexual drive of a person. Secondly, he should get an ultrasound done of the urinary tract to rule out the possibility of a stone in the urinary tract as well as any obstruction by the enlarged prostate. Thee possibilities need to be ruled out before one thinks of anything else. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",

            "answer": "Thank you for taking time to read and respond to my question/concern.\u00a0\u00a0I will certainly suggest my boyfriend to have these things checked out.\u00a0\u00a0I did not mention his age; 52.\u00a0\u00a0Also, do you or does anyone else out there reading this have a theory about why he needs this very constant steady pressure in the groin and testicle area with the heel of foot, knee or palm of hand in order to \"eventually\" reach ejaculation?\u00a0\u00a0It's important to say that we've been together 5 years and it's always been this way from the first time.\u00a0\u00a0It's getting worse though.\u00a0\u00a0And the frequent peeing is not just through the night.\u00a0\u00a0He has to pee almost every hour on the hour; sometimes he needs to pee less than a half hour after peeing.\u00a0\u00a0He keeps a bottle next to him in the car when he knows he's going to be on the road more than an hour.\u00a0\u00a0Please help me gather more information in order to persuade him to see a urologist!\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much out there.",

    "question": "My unprofessional \"guess\" is that prostate problems are playing into the problem I will describe for you.\u00a0\u00a0My boyfriend of 5 years has never been able to ejaculate normally inside me.\u00a0\u00a0He requiers strong pressure applied with the heel of the hand or the side of my leg to his scrotom area to the point of my thinking I must be hurting him.\u00a0\u00a0It has to go on and on and on before we begin to get anywhere.\u00a0\u00a0He struggles to \"get there.\"\u00a0\u00a0I work up a sweat and get hand or leg cramps from pressing and manipulating the groin area.\u00a0\u00a0It's a chore.\u00a0\u00a0He sometimes has to just give it up.\u00a0\u00a0When we are successful it's a violent and somewhat painful thing; \"hurts so good\" if-you-will.\u00a0\u00a0No wonder he doesn't want to have sex very often.\u00a0\u00a0He has to pee every hour it seems.\u00a0\u00a0He gets up to pee no less than 2 times per night.\u00a0\u00a0He groans when he pees.\u00a0\u00a0He once had normal sex with his wife he is divorced from.\u00a0\u00a0They had 2 kids.\u00a0\u00a0He has never ejaculated inside me.\u00a0\u00a0I've been patient and tried to except this as \"normal\" for us.\u00a0\u00a0But now that he only gives in to having sex with me maybe once every 8 weeks I am really getting fed up.\u00a0\u00a0What can I say to him to make him realize how important it is for him to see a urologist?\u00a0\u00a0He CAN'T be happy feeling this way!\u00a0\u00a0Is there hope for reversing all of this and having a normal sex life again some day?",
