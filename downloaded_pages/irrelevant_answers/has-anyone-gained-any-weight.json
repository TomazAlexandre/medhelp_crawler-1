            "answer": "Hi there and Congrats! I was just wondering the same thing!?! lol\u00a0\u00a0I think I've actually lost a pound or two. Not because I'm having nausea(morng sickness), but because I'm so scared of ballooning up this time around since I'm starting out a little overweight this time. I've decided NO JUNK FOOD, and I'm only eating what I need to be healthy. I've read a lot about if you're overweight to start, it's actually ok to not gain too much weight, so that's my goal. Good Luck to you!",

            "answer": "i was overweight before my last pregnancy & my doctor told me i shouldn't gain more than 15lbs!!! i actually only ended up gaining 14lbs - so by the time i left the hospital i weighed LESS than before i got pregnant! Luckily my pregnancy CRAVING is Special K & skim milk (weird, i know) - and i usually have SO much afternoon/evening nausea that my big meal is lunch...despite that they STILL told me I had borderline gestational diabetes last pregnancy - so this time i'm really going to watch my sugar!",
