            "answer": "1) I think if you drop caffine entirely like cold turkey it will do more harm than drinking what you do since your body is accomodated to what you have been doing. So if anything just start by drinking 4 a say and then less and less 1-2 wont hurt anything 2) you can have a misscarriage at anytime in your pregnancy, the risk just goes down a lot after 12 weeks. 3) i would stay away from the tanning beds, super dangerous even when you arent pregnant. 4) warm baths are not harmful as long as your internal body temp does not go over 102\u00b0",

    "question": "I'm 25 weeks today, i've been thinking alotabout my daily caffeine intake.\u00a0\u00a0Towards the beginning of my pregnancy I cut back a little, but i've noticed as time progressed, I drink roughly 5 mtn. dews a day. Is this harmful to the baby? It says online caffeine can be the cause of miscarriage, but i'm well past the point of being able to have one and i'm glad I cut down when I did. I've gone to the tanning bed a handful of times as well..one of my physicians said it was alright to go every once in a while, but the other specifically said no. Also, are warm baths considered to be harmful during pregnancy? Should I feel guilty for doing these things, everything seems to be going fine the doctor's say my baby girl is healthy, and I know there's women who do alot worse like smoking and drinking while pregnant who deliver perfectly healthy babies..should I feel guilty?",
