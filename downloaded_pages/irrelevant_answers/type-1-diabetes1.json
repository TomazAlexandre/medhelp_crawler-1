            "answer": "An insulin pump is something you need to ask your endocronologist for help with. Blood sugar log books can be sent to you from the company that you have your meter through; just call them. Your local Diabetes Charity could probably point you in the right direction too. I'm assuming you already have a pump, but they are all different & you need to be taught how to use it properly.",
