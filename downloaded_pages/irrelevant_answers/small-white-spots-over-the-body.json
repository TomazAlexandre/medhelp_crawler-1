            "answer": "Hello,Two possibilities are there for such depigementation.Firstly,it can be due to tinea versicolor. Tinea versicolor is caused by a fungus that lives in the skin of almost all adults. Factors that can cause the fungus to become more visible include high humidity and immune or hormone abnormalities.Treatment involves topical and oral antifungal medicines.Second possibility is of vitiligo. It is a pigmentation disorder in which melanocytes (the cells that make pigment) in the skin are destroyed. As a result, white patches appear on the skin in different parts of the body. Diagnosis can be confirmed by external examination, blood tests to check skin cell count\u00a0\u00a0for melanocytes and biopsy of the skin patches.I would advise a dermatologist\u2019s evaluation for the same.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts.Kind regards.",

    "question": "Hello Doc,My mum's 50 yrs and has developed white spots way smaller than the size of a pencil eraser over particular portions of her body such as her arms, thighs and back. They seem to be growing in number, although they dnt seem to bother her much in terms of irritation or anything of the sort. She is a homemaker and does not go out much which results in minimum exposure to the sun. What could they be ? Can it be cured ?",
