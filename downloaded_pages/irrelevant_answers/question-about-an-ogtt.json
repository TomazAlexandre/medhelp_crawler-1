    "question": "Hi,I have a question regarding the OGTT (75 g) test.I know that if the 2 hour level is above 11 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) it could mean diabetes.But what about the 1 hour level? What if it is also above 11 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) ?On the dlife website i have found the following information, but it only says the 1 hour level usually peaks at 160 180 mg/dl (8.89 10 mmol/l), but i wonder if it is above it, it could mean diabetes? Especially if it is above 11 mmol/l (200 mg/dl).\"On average, normal glucose levels typically peak at 160 180 mg/dl (8.89 10 mmol/l) from 30 minutes to 1 hour after administration of the oral glucose dose, and should then return to fasting levels of 140 mg/dl (7.78 mmol/l) or less within a 2- to 3-hour period.\"thank you for your help!",
