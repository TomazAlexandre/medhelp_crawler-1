My boyfriend is a type 1 and while he has had some lows when I am there or others are around, I get concerned about the \"what ifs\" - what if I am not there or nobody else is there either.I would discuss things over with your wife and let her know how you feel and what would make you feel better. Also I would check with her endo to see why she may be going low at night as she may have to up her carb intake or something.",

            "answer": "(not a doc).I have been a insulin dependent diabetic for over 15 years never went into a diabetic coma thank god. Some people are lucky for instance if there blood sugar goes low during the night they wakeup.However some people are the opposite they do not wake up.I feel your wife needs to see her doctor to see why she goes low at night not threat her like she is some freak that cannot take care of herself. Getting a nurse to stay is WAYYYYYYY over the top and if i was your wife i would go mad at you for even thinking that.",

            "answer": "I am happy to answer your question, for I am a type 1 wife of an Air Forcce officer with 25 years of service, and we have certainly run into the same issues. I am going to make a couple of suggestions here and then I am going to suggest that you contact the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's (JDRF) Online Diabetes Support Team to be matched up one-on-one with one of our volunteers (hopefully, ME, the only military wife on the team) for more specific advice.I can assure you that this has been a major worry for my husband and myself also through the years. The problem is that we sometimes make mistakes when figuring out our insulin-carb needs, no matter how careful we are, for factors such as stress and even hormones can play into making glucose levels drop at times when we don't expect it. I am not aware of any services provided by the military for medical assistance in the home while spouses are away, but I have worked out some routines that I believe make me safe now when my husband is TDY.First, I made an insulin change. Like your wife, my danger was at night, for when asleep we cannot help ourselves and may not arouse until our muscles and ability to think have been impaired so much that we cannot help ourselves. I finally was connected with an endocrinologist who suggested that I take my 24-hour insulin (Lantus) IN THE MORNING instead of at night. If your wife is on this type of insulin now, then this may be a good solution. You see, this insulin works for ALMOST 24 hours, but does sort of peter out after 18-24 hours, meaning that its ability to lower glucose levels diminishes some at the end of the 24-hour period. By taking it in the morning, it is slowly wearing off at night, and even if I get a little low, it cannot become life-threatening, for if I wait long enough, it will wear off entirely. I have had no severe night lows since starting this about a year and a half ago. None. Some people need to take a split dose of insulin, for they find that their morning glucose readings are actually too high. I take a tiny bit of Lantus at night just so SOMETHING is working at night, but only 2 units, so this is not enough to cause me severe danger. Meanwhile, I find that my glucose readings in the morning are just a tad higher than my bedtime readings now, so I can go to bed with glucose comfortably in thenormal range and not worry about dropping lower while I sleep. Lantus does have a slight peak action that happens about 4 hours after it is injected, and if your wife is taking Lantus and takes it at night, she may be peaking while she sleeps.The idea of a pump is a good one, too. Again, we can only adjust according to what our numbers are when we go to bed, and so it is still possible to have something unexpected happen while we sleep, but at least she can turn the pump's basal rate down some at night when you are away. I feel it is better to run a LITTLE higher than ideal than to risk a severe low at night when my husband is gone.Here are some other suggestions:1. Have your wife set her alarm clock to go off at about 2 a.m. so she can do a glucose test at that time. If her numbers are dropping, it will be obvious at that time (but not so low that she is incapacitated), and she can keep 6-oz. cans of juice by the bed so she can simply pop one open and drink it without having to get up at all. While a check in the middle of the night may disturb her sleep, this is a surefire safeguard against hypos at night.2. Keep several 6-oz. cans of juice on the nightstand by the bed and on a LOW shelf in the kitchen so if she wakes up in trouble, and finds that she cannot walk becuase she is dangerously low, she can still help herself, either by opening a can right there in bed, or by dragging herself to the kitchen and opening the low cabinet door. Just make sure that she does not have to be standing to get to the juice cans, for it is useless to have emergency foods placed too high for an unstable person ro reach them.3. You may try a warning system with a good friend or relative. Here's how it works: that person, who could be a sister or parent in another state, agrees to check e-mail every morning. Your wife sends a brief \"I am fine\" e-mail every morning when she wakes up. If no e-mail arrives by an agreed time, that person (friend or relative) calls the house. If nobody answers, that person calls a pre-arranged emergency person who has a key to your house AND knowledge of how to either give a glucagon shot or call 911. I have found nurses in my neighborhood or doctors and they have always been willing to be that emergency person. We keep a glucagon kit in a place that the emergency person knows about, and I know that if something were to happen to me, my system would bring help before the situation becamse a true crisis. The fact is that we hope to never have to use the emergency system, but we all sleep better at night knowing that I would be found in the early morning if I did have a low during the night that incapacitated me. My sister is my e-mail person, and the only things required from our busy schedules when my husband is gone is for me to take the few seconds necessary to send a \"good morning\" e-mail and for her to check to see if it got there.\u00a0\u00a0This systems has worked for me very well.As I wrote in my opening paragraph, I would be happy to communicate directly with your wife if you or she goes to the jdrf.org website and clicks on the Online Diabetes Support Team. She can then ask to be matched up wtih the military wife (that's\u00a0\u00a0me), and I can share with her 25 years of experience dealing with this issue and others that military type 1 dependents run into. I hope this helps you. Your concerns are smart ones and ones that we do need to protect ourselves from so that you and my husband can do your jobs wtihout worrying over our safety. Good luck, Sailor!",

    "question": "I am in the US Navy and am often gone for periods of time leaving my wife and baby girl alone.\u00a0\u00a0This would not be any reason for concern except for the fact that my wife has type one diabetes. She normally does an excellent job of maintaining her blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0However, she has a history of getting low at night and not realizing it because she is asleep.\u00a0\u00a0So far we have been lucky because I have been there to realize that there was a problem and get some sugar in her before things got worse.\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned that someday our little family will not be so lucky.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure that I am not the only person in the world in this type of situation.\u00a0\u00a0I was just hoping to get some ideas that would ensure my wife and baby's well being at those times when I am away. Some kind of night time call service maybe, or having a friend come over every morning, or even a nurse that lives with the family while I am gone (I think the nurse is the best idea).\u00a0\u00a0I even heard about a bracelet that gives a mild shock when a patients blood sugar is low to help them realize what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I am just concerned about her being alone and going into insulin shock without anybody realizing it until it is too late.\u00a0\u00a0She is looking into getting the pump which I think would help the situation a little but I still am uncomfortable.\u00a0\u00a0If you could give me some ideas as to what to do or some sources of information for people in my situation I would be comforted and thankful.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, a hopeful Sailor",
