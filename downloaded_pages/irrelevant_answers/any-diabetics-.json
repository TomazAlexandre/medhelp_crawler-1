            "answer": "I am a type 1 diabetic and got it with the onset of my first pregnancy. The perinatolgists are hard.core doctors who don't mess around, I know. They act like u are trying to harm ur baby. But ur dr is being rude! If u are doing everything u can and ur sugars are in control complications are less likely. But with any pregnancy things can happen. Perfectly healthy mothers have stillborns. It was recommend I terminate my first one bc my a1c Was 14.3 and my blood sugars were 600+. Luckily he came out with no problems. Now my a1c is 6.2 and they still tell me my sugars arent ideal....what the heck?? Never good enough! Vent away! I totally understand and its hard not to be down on yourself when u are doing ur best and they still knock u to the ground...",

            "answer": "I'm type 2 diabetic and currently 34wks pg. My Dr's have been strict with me but not mean. They switched me from metformin 1000mg 2x day to glyburide 2.5 2x a day. My a1c went from 6.8 to 5.1. I am very strict on my diet and try to never let my sugars get over 120 ( 2hrs after meal) n 90 fasting. My Dr's biggest concern is big baby ( measuring 4lbs at 30wks) and baby's sugar dropping once cord is cut. My perinatal specialist is recommending induction between 37-38wks n ob wants to wait till 38-39 but said it'll depend on baby's size and how my body n sugars are doing. Don't let the Dr's steal ur joy. Is it gonna be hard n frustrating, um most definitely, but u can do this..",

            "answer": "I'm also type 1 and have been for about 3 years. My doctors don't hound me too much, but I totally put more pressure on myself and lately have been frustrated by my sugars cause I'm 30 weeks and feel like I'm starting to have a hard time keeping them down. Sometimes I'm also over shooting my insulin and then having to eat more when I'm low just cause I'm paranoid about being high about and don't wanna run high.It's a battle and constant worry.I also am starting to feel pressure from the doctors to induce at 32 weeks and induced fine with that but induced really worried about them pushing a c section and i do not want a c section. I'm just fearful they will push one since I'm diabetic. Dumb.",

I'm wondering if the doctors are gonna wanna rush the process or try and force a csection if my body isn't moving forward as they expect? I'm gonna be induced at 39 weeks and I just don't want them to force a an unnecessary csection just because I'm diabetic.",
