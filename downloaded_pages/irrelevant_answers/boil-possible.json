            "answer": "Hi,Although most people with boils are otherwise healthy, boils are sometimes related to immune deficiency, anemia, and diabetes or iron deficiency. If you are overweight, try to reduce your weight and take regular exercise.\u00a0\u00a0It is important that you wash your hands regularly.\u00a0\u00a0Abscesses or boils may have a tendency to recur. Staph. aureus is most commonly carried in the nostrils, armpits, between the legs and in the cleft between the buttocks.Tiny nicks or grazes or something rubbing against the skin can inoculate the Staph. germ into the wall of a hair follicle.\u00a0\u00a0Once inoculated, the bacteria cause a boil, which goes on to run its usual course of about 10 days. If it persists, have this evaluated further by your dermatologist. Prescription antibiotics may be indicated.Take care and regards.",

    "question": "I've had this hard like boil grow on my groin on pubic hair (in the crease of my left thigh and pic area.)It was painful but I popped it, and blood poured out and the next day I squeezed it again and it was like a bump was underneath the first and it popped out pus. there were a few hairs pulled from it that had some pus on it as well.The last few days its been healing, its not wet nor has it scabbed..it looks like an old wound healing w/a red center like layer of skin trying to reform.Ive been working out tons, and Im a little overweight. Ive missed a shower here and there.Im usually a clean person though.Is this normal for boils, could this be something else?",
