            "answer": "duchess,1.Can be related to the Gastroparesis since it involves the vagus nerve.The low blood pressure itself is probably not. Some levels of autonomic dysfunction can be though. Commonly orthostatic hypotension is seen in patients with gastroparesis.2.What other things besides diabetes and hypothyroid can cause Gastroparesis?Any type of chronic illness can be associated with it as well as some medications that slow down GI motility such as opiates. Thyroid, diabetes and amyloid dirrectly affect the nerves of the gut. Alot of medications affect the way the movent of the bowels take place.3.If it is damage to vagal nerve what can be done to correct it?This is more of a question for a gastroenterologist. 1st, you need to find the cause and rectify that. That will either improve or halt/delay the progression of symtoms. There are some medicines that can increase GI motility such as reglan. Its a difficult disease to treat though.good luck",
