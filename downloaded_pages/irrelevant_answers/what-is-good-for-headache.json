            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.Prenatal care is very important. Not seeing your doctor will not cause direct harm to your baby, but proper prenatal care is directly related to a healthy pregnancy. Your doctor monitors the growth and activity of the baby to help diagnose any concerns that can be addressed before birth. Your doctor also monitors your health. Your blood pressure, and blood sugar are of particular concern during pregnancy. Elevated blood pressure and gestational diabetes are two treatable conditions that occur frequently during pregnancy. Without proper care and attention they can cause harm to both mother and baby.Another important part of prenatal care is prenatal vitamins. The folic acid that they contain helps with brain and spinal chord development.I hope this helps answer your question.Cathy",
