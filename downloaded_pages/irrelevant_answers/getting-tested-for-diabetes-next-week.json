I've been looking for some kind of change in my lifestyle all around (eliminating some unwanted stress, finding ways to improve eating habits, etc.) and maybe this is a good wake up call after all.Not knowing is the worst part so now I can get a jumpstart on what's ahead.\u00a0\u00a0I've been on some Diabetic websites and going through some of the symptoms and I've had a few of them for a long time, so we'll see what happens.Thanks for the support.",

So, while I am familiar with some aspects of type 2 diabetes, I'm not competent to offer you the information you're looking for.\u00a0\u00a0I'd suggest you go the the American Diabetes Association's site and read their information . . . they are more geared to type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry I can't offer you more . . . best of luck!",
