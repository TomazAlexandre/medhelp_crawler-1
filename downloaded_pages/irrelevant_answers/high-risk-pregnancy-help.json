            "answer": "Hi... by this stage of the first trimester you should be noticing a reduction in morning sickness as your hormones start to balance out...some lucky woman don't even get any sickness symptoms at all....and an unlucky few continue to have it throughout their pregnancy......not all woman experience exactly the same symptoms so some may have breast tenderness some may experience constipation etc.Not getting every symptom doesn't mean your pregnancy isn't progressing normally.\u00a0\u00a0I understand your anxiety though...I previously had a miss-carriage in November and tried and got pregnant again in January... but every little twinge I feel like running to the emergency.Unless you are actually experiencing bleeding and cramping I would try to relax because the stress of worrying wont be doing you or your little piece of heaven any favours.Your are heading into the second trimester so your body is now starting to make more blood which can result in the feeling of light headedness and dizziness.....It wouldn't hurt going to speak to your GP just to set your mind at ease and discuss ways of getting your blood sugar levels in check.... I'm not sure of the implication for your little bundle if you don't...but it's a little more difficult to miscarry once you've passed the first trimester...Good luck x",

Sm not in medical field but your symptoms might be related to the diabetes and bp and the sooner you see a doctor the better.",
