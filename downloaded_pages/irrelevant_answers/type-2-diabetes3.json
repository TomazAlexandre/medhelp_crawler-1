            "answer": "Unfortunately, I'm not certain about the numbers you are presenting.\u00a0\u00a0If the 8.0 - 19.4-22 is your Hemaglobin A1C, then that sounds pretty high to me.\u00a0\u00a0Since I am not a physician, I can't tell you what the highest acceptable range is or what the consequences might be.\u00a0\u00a0The length of time your blood sugars remain high will also have an impact on the consequences.\u00a0\u00a0I do know that studies have found that diabetics with A1C's below 7 drastically reduce their risk of having any of the long term complications of diabetes which can be very serious.I don't know how you are currently treating your diabetes, but when blood sugars are extremely elevated for long periods of time in Type 2 diabetics, insulin injections may be recommended to help lower the blood sugars. I know how scary injections can be to a Type 2, but if that is what your doctor ultimately recommends, I promise you that it will be better than how you are probably feeling now and certainly beter than having some of the complications that can occur from prolonged high blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Your higher blood sugars may also be caused by your lung infection, so this may be a temporary setback\u00a0\u00a0for you.\u00a0\u00a0Keep following your doctor's advice and I hope you feel better soon.Es",
