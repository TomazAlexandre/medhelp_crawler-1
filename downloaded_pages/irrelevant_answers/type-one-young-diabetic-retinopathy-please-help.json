I have been on the pump since I was sixteen which is over 12 years now.\u00a0\u00a0I check my bs regularly and I used to work at Clara Barton Camp for girls living with diabetes... I loved it but I cannot afford to go away and work at camp anymore.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I am just looking for others to relate or who can understand where I am in my life.\u00a0\u00a0I am not negative.. but I feel that I am very realistic about the future....humalog only came out when I was 16...untill then NPH and R and I was a child who naturally rebelled and snuck candy in..... My email is ***@**** and I really would love to hear from others.....Thank you for reading this...hope to hear from you soon!!Rachel",
