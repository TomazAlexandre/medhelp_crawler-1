            "answer": "Hi there.In medicine, only about a 1/10th of all the occurrences in the human body can be fully explained, and it's really a challenge for most doctors to diagnose certain conditions.\u00a0\u00a0What you have described may very well be hard to diagnose especially if all your scans and tests turn out to be negative.\u00a0\u00a0For these conditions, treatment is directed symptomatically.\u00a0\u00a0Common causes for this symptoms include changes in blood pressure (high or low) or metabolic problems more commonly diabetes.Your situation will really entail a lot of patience and a very good physician-patient relationship.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you and your doctors can clinch the diagnosis soon.Take care and God bless.",

    "question": "A year ago I got out of a freezing pool of water (ice bath) at my gym and within minutes was overcome with a lightheaded feeling, behind my eyes somewhere. I could aslo describe the feeling as a 'numbness' or 'pressure.'My eyesight has also been affected in the way that my surroundings seem skewered and different - especially in bright light (supermarkets, sunny days etc). Otherwise my health is good.I've had MRI's, XRAYS and blood tests. I've seen nuerologists and ENTs and they are as stumped as I, and seem to agree that it's some kind of migraine condition.Does this make sense?have you heard of people with conditions like this? It's really wearing me out.Thanks,JC",
