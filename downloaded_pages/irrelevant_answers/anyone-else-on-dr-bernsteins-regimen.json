            "answer": "J J's mom,I have been following Dr Bernstein's guidelines for about a year now. I haven't reduce my carbs as low as he suggests, to 30 grams a day, mainly because I find it inconvenient. And I have achieve satisafactory glycemic control at 60-75 grams of carbs a day.My biggest reservation, based on popularised conventional wisdom,\u00a0\u00a0was that cholesterol would increase and kidney function would deteriorate. So I tested before starting with this way of eating and every three months since then. After a year, my lipid profile is better than it has ever been. And there has been no change in kidney function.As they say in the classics, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Doctors and dietitians continue to tell me that I am playing with fire. But tests indicate that I am in good shape. And marginal retinopathy, that had developed because of consistently high blood suagar, has cleared up because of the improved glycemic control.Maybe Dr Bernstein and the low-carb brigade are really onto something here. It certainly works for me. So I wont't be changing anything soon.Cheers,Mark",

            "answer": "Thankyou Markie for sharing your experience. There are sooooo many positive testimonies like yours regarding this approach that I am looking into it. I don't expect the conventional medical world to embrace it with open arms though.I\u00a0\u00a0would be treading cautiously with a child on this regimen, but having chatted on the Bernstein forum, I have met parents with kids on this program who are thriving on a pretty low carb content to their diet.Even over the few days we have tried the principles (I only got the actual book today), and my son has improved glycaemic control dramatically, and the crashing hypos have all but disappeared.Cheers,JJ's mom",

            "answer": "The debate rages on over this.But - it's actually just common sense.\u00a0\u00a0The idea is to eat lower carb meals that contain the proper calories you need to function and maintain a healthy weight.\u00a0\u00a0And to physically move around and keep your body exercised.I think the biggest problem with people who embark upon this diet is that they drop the carbs fine, but fail to make sure they get enough calories ....",

    "question": "Thanks so much Mr. Gatorade for your comment to the long distance runner re:Dr. Bernstein's Regimen and 'exercise technique'. By googling \"Bernstein Diabetes\" as you suggested, a whole new world of info has opened up, and it seems that there is enormous hope for people with diabetes to avoid many complications and achieve excellent control.I have ordered Doc. Bernstein's book, \"Diabetes Solution\", and wondered whether there are any others on this forum who have followed this approach. How long have you been on this regimen? I would love to hear personal testimonies/comments etc.",
