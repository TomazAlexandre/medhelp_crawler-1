            "answer": "Lyme is a possibility, however in most cases the problem is due to lack of circulation. The shaking is often due to a calcium deficiency, generally secondary to low levels of vitamin D3. So, a Lyme test would be reasonable, as well as a dopplar of the legs, and a D3 level test.",

            "answer": "I'm thinking it's a circulatory issue as well. Tired, achy legs are cardinal signs of blood pooling in the leg veins. Do you have swelling in your legs when on your feet for extended periods of time? The veins in the legs have valves to prevent the backflow of blood. Veins have no ability to pump blood back to the heart. Repeated muscle movements are needed to 'milk' the blood to the heart. Sometimes these valves get leaky and don't hold the blood properly. You can wear compression stockings to assist the blood return. They are very effective in managing achy, tired legs. Elevating your legs and wiggling your toes is helpful too.Other causes are potassium, calcium and magnesium deficiencies. Lasix (furosemide) is a common diuretic that depletes potassium. Your local health food store is a great source of information for mineral supplements.",
