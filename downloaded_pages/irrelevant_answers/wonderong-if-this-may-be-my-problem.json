            "answer": "I agree with Forum-volunteer-cmb that your symptoms sound very much like what we experience when our glucose levels get too low. Borrowing your mother's meter and doing a glucose test when you feel this way would be a smart way to find out. If you ARE hypoglycemic, there are some dietary changes that may help alleviate the symptoms. You may want do do a Google search on hypoglycemia... there are lots of articles on the web about it.",
