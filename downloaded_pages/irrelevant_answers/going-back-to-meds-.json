            "answer": "I can relate to not wanting to be on meds.\u00a0\u00a0I'm currently on day 4 of zoloft to treat panic disorder and ptsd.\u00a0\u00a0For the past 3 months I've had the prescription but felt I could get rid of the anxiety by doing yoga, vitamins, rest etc... Those things did help, but not completly.\u00a0\u00a0I am pill phobic so taking these meds completely terrifies me... However if we struggled with diabetes we wouldn't question taking meds.\u00a0\u00a0I've come to accept this is the same.\u00a0\u00a0We are struggling with anxiety and years of stress have thrown our brain chemicals out of balance.\u00a0\u00a0Their is no shame in working to correct this.\u00a0\u00a0I hope the lexipro helps you get back to being yourself again :)",

I'm so upset about it, but lately, I'm in a miserable state of mind, making the life of my family just so sad.... I feel like a big failure! I was on Lexapro\u00a0\u00a0for 2 -3 years, got off meds to get pregnant, did really well for 2 years, and now my anxiety it's just consuming me again. I'm always worried with health anxiety, always tired, on edge, restless, weird feelings all over my body. Had doctors apps. done, tests clear.... I don't know what else to do..... Sorry for venting here, but I feel like my family and friends are just tired of my worries and complaints.....",
