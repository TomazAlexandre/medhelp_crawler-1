            "answer": "Hello, you might be experiencing hypoglycemia, when your blood sugar gets too low, it is common in some diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0I have felt shaky, dizzy, confused, like I'm gonna be sick, and it goes away when I eat a snack.\u00a0\u00a0I would ask your doctor to perform an oral glucose tolerance test with a fasting test to see if your blood sugar gets low, and it wouldn't hurt to start monitoring it.\u00a0\u00a0You can buy a store brand monitor starter kit with strips and everything for less than 20 dollars. I actually like the Walmart brand better than most more expensive ones.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and I hope I was of help to you. Take care!!!",

            "answer": "I've never heard of males taking an \"oral glucose test\". The oral glucose tolerance test is used to screen pregnant women for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.Diet control is NO sugar in any form. That includes carb sugar and milk sugars too. Carefully read the ingredient labels on all foods. Do not get confused that all carbohydrates should be eliminated from ones diet, for their are good carbs and bad carbs. This may help you understand http://www.spinalhealth.net/choosing.html .Did your doctor give you blood sugar monitoring and/or test kit? You need to be testing your glucose levels before and after each meal to see if your food intake and liquid intake are playing with your glucose levels.",

            "answer": "One thing you didn't mention is how your doctor determined you were a diabetic. I'm going to assume you fasted for 10-12 hours before getting blood drawn - no foods or colored liquids during that time period. If you didn't fast then your 143 glucose reading is a false positive. The test most doctors administer to determine if you are diabetes candidate is called HgbA1c or hemoglobin A1c. Read about it herehttp://www.diabetes-blood-sugar-solutions.com/a1c-blood-test.html",

            "answer": "Sounds to me like your ketones might be high. Sometimes it makes u feel sick, dizzy, and just plain tired at first. And if u did this change real fast it all adds up. U can get ketone strips at drug stores and Walmart. Its not a bad thing if your BS are under control. I agree with WaveRider, what is with Dr. that say your BS is kinda high go diet for two weeks and well see where u are! Geez....... U need a A1c. Your dr. won't give u a kit, u can get them at walmart, walgreens. I just bought I think my 100th and I got the tiny slim One touch for 12.99. After u get your glucose meter, and I suggest this strongly, the chance of Diabetes going away is not real. Once u get it u can control it, or it will control u. Ask your dr. to write u a prescription for the strips, I get mine, 100 strips for 16.87. One touch. I am betting its the change in diet so quick and ketone build up. But do ask your dr. for a A1C it tell your over all last 2 month BS. A one time test doesn't tell much. The advantage of a meter is u can test before or two hrs after to see what the trigger foods for your high BS's do. And going from a trashy diet to a clean one doesn't always bring on a good feeling, toxins are trying to get out, and exercising in excess can make them pour out of your system. My guess is u will start feeling better soon. U can go to www. atkinsdiet.com, there is a forum and lots of helpful people on there. Thats my support group for my dieting and diabetes. I hope u feel better soon...",

            "answer": "\"My A1c is 6.9.\u00a0\u00a0Whats the range of a A1c, whats the low and whats the high.\"HgbA1c lab ranges can vary from lab to lab. You need to look at your test results for the ranges. If you don't have them ask your doctor's office for a copy of your test results. Test results are yours free for the asking. The range will be indicated next your test score. If not, call the lab. Usually A1c normal range is <6%.\"Would the rice and the candy bar have effected the reading the next day? \"Yes, but keep in mind fasting glucose test measures your blood glucose at that time only and not for other times. This is where the HgbA1c test comes in. Google it for there are many sources that explains the test and why its given. Also, I wouldn't believe rumors that white rice is bad for you. Yes, its a starch but research has shown it doesn't increase glucose as much as what was once thought.As far as the Chinese food and candy bar raising you glucose levels the next day? Sure, especially if you consumed sweet and sour XXX which means lots of sugar and some vinegar then a candy bar afterwards - sugar in your blood doesn't disappear overnight.Keep in mind your level is low and can be controlled by diet. Ignore your diet and you will be depending on medication for the rest of your life, unless science finds a cure for diabetes.Good luck.",
