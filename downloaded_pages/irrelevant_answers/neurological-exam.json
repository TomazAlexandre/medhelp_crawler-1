            "answer": "Hi there.The natural course of diagnosis and management of any diseases especially in neurology, is that further testing could be requested based on the doctor's over all impression (based on history and physical or neurologic exam).\u00a0\u00a0In your situation, the doctor may not have been able to find such conclusive evidence to warrant further testing from her examinations.\u00a0\u00a0I agree with the ENT consult just to rule out the possibilities.\u00a0\u00a0If everything else is normal, what you are experiencing may be migraines with auras.\u00a0\u00a0Auras are sensation that usually accompany a migraine attack.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to discuss this possibility with the neurologist and get treatment for such.Until then, avoid stress as much as possible and have adequate rest.\u00a0\u00a0Regards and God bless.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the reply!Ive read alot on Migraines too and it appears that they create similiar symptoms. I do not have a history of headaches. This all happened suddenly within the past 6-8 weeks. The pressure that I feel throughout my head isnt always accompanied by pain. When there is slight pain, its more like a tension headache and not severe icepick headaches. The pressure is like sinus pressure or a band around my head without the cold/allergy symptoms.Im really confused and annoyed by all of this. Im so eager to feel normal again. Ive been reading about the early stages of diabetes which also has similar symptoms. I havent been tested for this yet but may include that on my list.",

            "answer": "How often do Neurological Exams check out \"normal\" but one still have a tumor that doesnt effect balance, thinking, coordination, senses, motor skills, etc...If by some chance my symptoms: floaters, intermitten headaches, pressure in my head was tumor related. Would the tumor effect all the Neurological Exam stuff too?",

            "answer": "I just got my MRI results back and everything looks normal which is a great sign. If my eyes are fine, blood work and blood sugar looked normal, and nothing was found in my MRI, what could be causing such symptoms?",

    "question": "Lately Ive been having mild tension like headaches, dull pressure throughout my head, visual floaters, and very very mild vertigo type symptoms. Not super dizzy vertigo, or room spining sensations, but intermitten feelings of being off balance but not to the point of falling.I had a complete eye exam for the floaters and headaches from an Opthalmologist that came out good. He said my eyes were in great health.When visiting my family physician, she performed a standard Neurological Exam in the office. Im assuming this is a basic test to check my balance, reflexes, coordination, motor skills, etc... All of this checked out ok as well.Is it possible that my Neuro. Exam came out fine and my vision, balance, coordination, etc... was all ok and I still have a tumor or some other disease or neurological issue thats causing these symptoms?Im seeing and ENT next week to see if the pressure could be sinus related. I have no other cold/allergy symptoms but I guess its possible.",
