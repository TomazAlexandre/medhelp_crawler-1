            "answer": "Just try not to keep her on Prednisone for a long time as it can cause health problems like diabetes. I know this, because I have an IBD cat. IBD cats are usually treated with prednisone along with other things. As the IBD gets worse, the dosis increases (until the cat has to be put to sleep) So then you have a diabetic, IBD cat. But, after all, medication for a long time has its side effects, right? Usually, the liver gets damaged, and if it isn't the liver then it's the heart; but something gets messed up when both humans and animals are kept on medication long term.",

            "answer": "I'd suggest to give her the Prednisone first thing in the morning. It's like for humans I believe and humans take Prednisone at 7AM.Side effects will probably be the same than for humans: a voracious appetite! Try to dose her dry food daily so she only eats the amount the is supposed to eat. She may be hyper at first as well. She may also get bloated.Long term side effects: diabetes, osteoroposis.",
