    "question": "Hi Dr.I took my 1 hour tolerance test last week. I was given 50 grams of glucose and my blood was tested an hour later.\u00a0\u00a0My results came back 126, which is supposedly normal.\u00a0\u00a0My concern is that with my son (pregnant a year ago) my test came back at 95.\u00a0\u00a0I sent a message to my office, because I it appears that my body is not processing sugar as well and the nurse just waved it off, saying it was in normal range.\u00a0\u00a0Do you think I should be monitoring my sugar more closely?\u00a0\u00a0My next appointment is end of November.My second random question is, someone told me to try shining a light to my belly to get the baby to move. I tried it for 30 seconds and then read that it could damage their eyes....is this a real concern?I appreciate your help!",
