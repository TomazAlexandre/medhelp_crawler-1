            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!What you have is probably brain fog and it can be due to several causes like liver dysfunction (get liver enzymes done\u2014liver function test), kidney dysfunction (get kidney function test done), and anemia. Poor sleep pattern and sleep problems like sleep apnea too can cause brain fog. You may sleep your customary 8-10 hours, feel fresh and yet have a sleep problem. Sleep studies by sleep specialists can help diagnose this. Low Vit D or Vit B12 too could be the cause. Hypothyroidism, diabetes and hormonal imbalance in men- this could be related to low testosterone, should be investigated.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Take care!",
