            "answer": "Hello,Psychological reasons are one of the important causes of erectile dysfunction. Talk to your partner openly and discuss the relationship issues. Lifestyle choices like excessive smoking, being overweight and avoiding exercise are other possible causes. In such cases quitting smoking, losing excessive weight, and increasing physical activity may help some men regain sexual function.In your partner\u2019s case, diabetes may be one of the reasons and he may need oral hypoglycemis along with diet control as well.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi I wonder if anyone can help me, I have been with my partner for a year and in all this time he has never been able to maintain a proper erection or have an orgasm, at first I thought the problem was with me but I have recently found out that even if he tries to mastubate he has the same problem. He does have diabetes (diet controlled) and seems to have a normal sex drive but he blatently refuses to discuss it with me or anyone else (I have suggested seeing his GP) He gets very upset if I broach the subject, he is 48 and apart from the diabetes seems generally healthy.",
