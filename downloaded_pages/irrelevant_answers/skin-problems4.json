            "answer": "Check out if it could be a type of Mange. This can be picked up easily especially if she exercises in fields/countryside. Wild foxes, etc can spread it. Does her skin smell odd? The vet can do a skin-scraping, and if it is, usually a shot will cure it. I had a dog years ago that got this, he had one shot at the vet's and was ok. It took a while for the hair to grow back though",
