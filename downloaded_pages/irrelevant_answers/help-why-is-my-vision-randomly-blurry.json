            "answer": "Well, I would see an opthamologist just in case. But it could also be a blood suger or blood pressure problem. If you get migraines do you usually get an aura? I get the aura then the migraine within about 30 minutes. First thing though is see the eye doctor. I would also post on the eye care or opthamology site too. It is on the forums and they have doctors that get back to you there. Perhaps they have an idea.take care,mkh9",

    "question": "I am 34 years old and lately my vision has been getting really blurry all of a sudden.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s hard to explain and I can\u2019t seem to pin point what is triggering this. Seems like out of nowhere I will start squinting real bad and can hardly see.. Then it goes back to normal and seems to just come and go. I normally have 20/20 vision. I started thinking maybe that was a sign I was going to get a migraine, but the last two days when this has happens no migraine has come. I am starting to get very worried.. Any Ideas??",
