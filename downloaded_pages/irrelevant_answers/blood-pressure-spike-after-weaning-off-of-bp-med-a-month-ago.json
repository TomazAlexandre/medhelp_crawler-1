            "answer": "It is not uncommon to have a low heart rate with an higher blood pressure, and also a rate of 51 is not terribly concerning in a healthy young person like yourself.HCTZ is a reasonable first line BP medication, and is actually what we often use for patients with only hypertension and no other diseases (diabetes, etc). Labetalol was chosen because it is known to be safe in pregnancy, but there is no reason you have to continue on it now that you've already delivered.",

    "question": "I am a 45 year old female and had a baby 3 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0I developed hypertension after she was born and was put on 200 mg Labetalol twice a day.\u00a0\u00a0It did what it was supposed to do, however I also developed post partum anxiety/depression and was put on Escitalopram, Alprazolam (as needed) and klonopin (1mg) at night only.\u00a0\u00a0The side effects of the labetalol for me were awful, so once my readings got better, I weaned off of it and am now not taking anything for Bp which usually stays in a good range (120-135 over 78-85).\u00a0\u00a0Some days it's a bit high and some days it's normal.\u00a0\u00a02 nights ago it spiked to 163/99 and my heart rate went down to 51.\u00a0\u00a0This concerns me as I had Bradychardia after my baby was born and the BP was high, but it went back to normal.\u00a0\u00a0It went back to normal/borderline over the past couple of days, however I also started taking Hydrochlorothiazide the morning after the spike (prescribed by my ENT for pressure and tinnitus in my left ear).\u00a0\u00a0So I guess my question is, is the low heart rate normal with that type of BP spike?\u00a0\u00a0They did an echocardiogram when I was hospitalized after my baby was born and said it was fine and my EKG's were fine, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Obviously with my anxiety, this still worries me.\u00a0\u00a0My cardiologist does NOT want to change my BP med, even though I told her that the side effects were bad on the labetalol and made my anxiety worse.\u00a0\u00a0I know there are a LOT of BP meds out there.\u00a0\u00a0I am not breast feeding, so that isnt' in the equation.\u00a0\u00a0Thank\u00a0\u00a0you for your help.",
