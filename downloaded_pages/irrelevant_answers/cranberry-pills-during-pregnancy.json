            "answer": "jess122308What are the risks of taking cranberry?Side effects. Cranberries, cranberry juice, and cranberry extracts are safe. Excessive amounts could cause upset stomach or diarrhea. Pregnant women might suffer these side effects at lower doses.Risks. If you think you have a urinary tract infection, don't rely on cranberries. There's no good evidence that it will help. Instead, see a doctor. If you have health conditions like aspirin allergy or kidney stones, check with a doctor before using cranberry for a health condition. Sweetened cranberry drinks can be high in calories and high-fructose corn syrup, and thus may be inadvisable for people with diabetes or weight problems.Interactions. If you take any drugs regularly, talk to your doctor before you start using cranberry supplements. They could interact with medicines like blood thinners, some antibiotics, aspirin, antacids, proton pump inhibitors, and drugs that affect the liver.While cranberry juice is generally safe, children or women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take cranberry for medical purposes unless a doctor recommends it.",
