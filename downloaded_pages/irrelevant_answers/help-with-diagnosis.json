            "answer": "Hi,I think you should get yourself evaluated for cervical spondylitis and try physiotherapy , exercises and hot fomentation on the advice of your physician. This should definitely help. Also, simultaneously you should get yourself investigated for chronic sinusitis. Sinusitis is one of the most common and treatable cause of chronic headaches. You would need to take some antibiotics, antihistaminics, nasal sprays, saline nasal drops and steam inhalation for the sinusitis on your physicians advice. The headaches will respond to the above treatment if they were due to the sinusitis. Also you need to get your eye sight checked for any visual disturbances which could also cause or increase your symptoms. Try some OTC painkillers and antianxiety medication like alprazolam alongside and see if the headaches respond. But if despite the above measures the headaches persist you need to see a neurologist for complete evaluation and further management.",

    "question": "I am a 26 yearold female and have had a persistant headache for almost 4 weeks now. I don't normally get headaches. They don't really fall under migraine, cluster or tension headaches. I constantly have\u00a0\u00a0a dull headache, it has never gone away. I experiance times of a more intense throbbing headache that lasts sometimes for a few hours and sometimes experiance a sharp throbbing stabbing sensation that will come and go for anywhere from 10 minutes to a few hours. I have not been sleeping well, sometimes trying to rest only makes it worse. It is mostly located in the top of my head radiating to the back. sometimes radiating down my forehead and into my eyes. sometimes my ears feel a little achy. I have also been\u00a0\u00a0dizzy. I had a nosebleed occur once with a sharp pain behind my eye, and my left eye started twitching when the headaches occured and has persisted daily . Last year about this same time I experienced similar symptoms only headaches were not as intense. Tylenol and Ibuprofen do not help. I had a MRI scan and it came out clear and normal. I have also had ear ringing and buzzing since happened last year, and more so now with headaches. Help-?",
