I would recommend that he therapist and try to sort this out.",

    "question": "My question is about a friend of mine. He is 62 years old. Has type 2 diabetes and heart disease. He quit smoking 3 years ago and started drinking 3-4 drinks a day. The main issue is a drastic personality change. He is married with grown children. He used to be very docile and loving to his family. Lately he is agressive (not physcially but verbally) he also has been going to strip clubs and visiting porn sites. This is very unlike him. I didn't know if this personality change could be as a result of all his medication and a mix with the alcohol or if a mini stroke could cause this. It is very unlike him to be doing things that he used to think were immoral.",
