    "question": "Hi,3 months ago I received unprotected oral from a gal that likes to party. It was wrong/stupid and the first time anything like that has ever happened.About 4 weeks after the event, I started having a dull ache in my penis and a frequent need to urinate. Doc tested me for herpes (negative) and for chlam/gon (negative). Gave me one diflucan and cipro to take for 2 weeks.2 weeks ago I had sex with my girlfriend for the first time in a couple of months (I travel a lot). 5 days after the event she started itching, but she took a diflucan and an OTC med and it seemed to clear up.I'm freaked out - my biggest concern is that I do not want to hurt or infect my girlfriend. She is faithful and is obviously a much better person than I am. I've had no discharge, no bumps, no redness, no swelling, no pain when urinating etc.... nothing like that. But there is a slight tingle in the tip of my penis (inside... in the urethra) and I still have a frequent need to urinate. Am wondering if it's psychosomatic or if it is mycoplasma genetaliam or NGU or something else... would anything like that have shown up in the urine test? I had another one last week - neg for chlam/gon again. Culture was also neg.Any advice or insight would be great. If it matters I'm a 27 year old heterosexual male who has only had two sexual partners (both referenced above) in the past 5 years. It may simply be guilt although it's the need to urinate is undeniable (and volume of urine is adequate when I have to go... i.e., no dribbles, etc.). I don't have diabetes or any other health issue that would account for the need to urinate.Thanks much.",
