            "answer": "Hello,This is a very stressful time for you and your husband.Could you ask the Drs whether there is possibility if he has type 1, instead of type 2.\u00a0\u00a0It is possible to have type 1 diabetes at any age.\u00a0\u00a0They can find this out by testing for antibodies and also by testing c-peptide which tells how much insulin his body is still producing.\u00a0\u00a0Given that his blood sugar is this high, even with treatment (normal is < 7.7), it could be a possibility.Is he on insulin yet?I would like to reassure you that diabetes is a manageable disease with the right tools; including medications, diet, and exercise.Suggest you start reading up.\u00a0\u00a0Some good books are Diabetes Solutions (by Dr. Richard Bernstein).\u00a0\u00a0If he will be on insulin then Using Insulin (by John Walsh), and Think Like a Pancreas, are also very helpful books.Please come back and let us know how things are going?",

Change your diet, watch the carbohydrates, get exercise, test his/your levels often, let him know that you are there every step of the way.\u00a0\u00a0to me, there is no better support system than having someone walk in the same shoes at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0Spend more times taking walks and being outdoors.\u00a0\u00a0Join a gym or do yoga together.\u00a0\u00a0Bottom line, let him know that you are willing to do whatever is necessary in order to help him out.\u00a0\u00a0The lifestyle changes are only as difficult as you want them to be.\u00a0\u00a0Again, if you look at them as a penalty, you're likely to not stick with a program.\u00a0\u00a0Look at it as your time to get things right and it often seems to come together a lot easier.\u00a0\u00a0Keep in touch and let us know how its going.",

            "answer": "Hi, a lot of the times, even some of the healthiest of people can get diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I was one of those individuals. I was healthy, very athletic, muscular, super active-on-the-go all the time.... Then one day, I woke up just not feeling well. I was exhausted all the time. Couldn't get out of bed. I would go to work and come home and sleep all night til the next day. I started gaining all kinds of weight and no matter how much I worked out, I started gaining like crazy. After seeing 6 doctors, it finally took a thyroid specialist tol find out & tell me I had a metabolic disorder that was throwing my thyroid into hypothyroidism, which threw my liver enzymes up and into non alcoholics fatty liver disease ... Which then resulted into chronic kidney stones and type 2 diabetes. The best way to support your spouse is not to play the blame game or make him feel guilty at all. Support him by cooking him healthy meals and eating them with him. Remove the temptations and avoid things that can spike his sugar levels. Not all of us eat ourselves into a diabetic frenzy. If he hates to exercise, even the smallest amount like a 30 min walk a day makes a big difference. I hate being a diabetic. It's so much worse for women then it is men...\u00a0\u00a0It already sounds like you are on a great path to help him just by being concerned.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes weightloss reverses type 2... And if it gets out of hand, gastric bypass reverses it too! Good luck!",

    "question": "My Husband just told me two days ago that he has diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He's 48 and just slightly overweight- this was quite a surprise to us.He had a fasting glucose of ~300 and A1C of 7.8.\u00a0\u00a0He was put on metformin 500 1x/day.I guess I'm having a tough time really understanding what he's going through right now.\u00a0\u00a0We were just married in January and he's 18 years older than I am.\u00a0\u00a0We have had a few discussions about what this means for our lifestyle and how he feels about this.\u00a0\u00a0The only feeling I get from him is that he feels he's letting me down by not being as healthy as he thought he was.Does anyone have any tips or advice on how to best support him in these early weeks/months?",
