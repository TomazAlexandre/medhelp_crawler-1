    "question": "My four year old daughter is constantly say she is hungry. I mean every half hour! My family is very traditional in the sense that we eat all of our meals together at the table. My boyfriend and I have noticed that she out eats us both. Recently we have been trying to limit how much she gets. Even after eating a huge meal, she'll ask for dinner again in a half hour. Her doctor says she's under weight on the bmi chart. But every time she eats her belly gets hard and distended, but still wants more. Anyone else experience this? If so, what have you done?",
