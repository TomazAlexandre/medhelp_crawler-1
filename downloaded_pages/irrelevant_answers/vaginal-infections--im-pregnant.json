            "answer": "Hi!The treatment will depend on the type of infection\u2014bacterial vaginosis, fungal infection, non-specific vaginitis due to low estrogen or low lactobacillus, or a STD. Hence, first you need to get a swab test done. Also, check and see whether you have developed diabetes in pregnancy (called gestational diabetes) as this increases your risk for infection. Usually you will be prescribed local treatments depending on what the swab culture shows. Also, good personal hygiene, and drinking plenty of water and fluids helps. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
