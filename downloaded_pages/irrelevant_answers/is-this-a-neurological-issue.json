            "answer": "Hi!Since, the spasms come after exercise, possibility of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance should be looked into. An EMG should be done to rule out myositis. Vitamin B and D deficiencies should be ruled out. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Hence if you take alcohol or coffee then cut this down. Sleep at regular hours and see if it helps. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes, Lyme's, lupus or hypothyroidism can also be the cause.So ask your doctor to rule out these with the required tests. If nothing is found, consult a neurologist. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the reply. it doesn't happen just after exercise though. Since July I have developed a visible pulse/twitch in that area. it gets worse with exercise (area feels tighter like someone is squeezing) but is still there at rest (http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x13ekvd_pulse-at-rest_lifestyle). Since the pulse became visible in July I have also noticed bouts of shaky vision and over the last three weeks my hands have become increasingly shaky/weak. I'm not sure how much of this is due to stress/nerves or whatever has actually been messing with me for almost 5 months now.Since this muscle twitch/spasm is occuring constantly (at rest, worsening with exercise) what direction would you advise me to go in? Thanks for your replies, they are greatly appreciated.",

    "question": "Should I see a neurologist?http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x13ekvd_pulse-at-rest_lifestylehttp://www.dailymotion.com/video/x13ekyk_pulse-after-20-pushups_lifestyleI was told these are muscle spasms. The most recent Dr. I saw didn't really have an answer for why this was happening and didn't suggest anything. I don't know where to go / who to see to fix this. and yes there is pain/tightness/squeezing in that area when exercising and a generally uncomfortable feeling there while at rest because that area is constantly twitching.",
