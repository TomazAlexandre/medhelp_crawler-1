            "answer": "Thanks all. It's hard as she's going through seperation.anxiety and cries for me when I leave the room saying \"mumma\" :( she's 17 months AMD very aware if I am.not.there..bless her. And it depends. You could be induced early if baby is growing too big or your sugars are out of.control. and here if you haveny gone .naturally they induce you on your due date. I wish I could.go overdue.. would rather that than being induced again..being induced isn't all its cracked out to be..but oh well its best for baby if he's out sooner.. just hope it doesnt take days and days.. my cervix wasn't very favorable a few days ago.so might take a while..",

I'm nervous/anxious as hell as I had an awful induction experience with my daughter and it took.three days. She was then ill after being born.and in.special care with a bad infection.

Also.anxious to be apart from my daughter as I'm a stay at home mum and with her 24/7 .. going to miss her loads! Well wish Mr luck..will update when I.can if I can get signal.on.the ward. Take care all! I'm so scared :'( and worried.how much ill miss my girl.",
