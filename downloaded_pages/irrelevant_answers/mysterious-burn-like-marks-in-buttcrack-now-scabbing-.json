    "question": "okay, any help with this would be phenomenal. Two days ago i developed two red stinging marks on each of my butt cheeks in the fold, a little close together. Yesterday they swelled up and burned to the touch. Today, theyre scabbing over.. Ive noticed that ive been excessively sweating in my lower region, both front and back. I started my period and used pads that broke me out before. Ive been told it could be a sign on HIV, Chlamydia, etc. and i cant afford to go to a doctor right now, but ive been with the same man for almost 5 years and we've been tested.. I dont believe ive ever had eczema and im 19. Any help is wonderful.",
