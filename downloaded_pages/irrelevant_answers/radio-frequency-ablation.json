            "answer": ",Hello,I think you mean rhizotomy and not rhivotomy.\u00a0\u00a0They are different, very different. A rhizotomy\u00a0\u00a0is a neurosurgical procedure that selectively severs problematic nerve roots in the spinal cord, most often to relieve the symptoms of neuromuscular conditions such as spastic diplegia and other forms of spastic cerebral palsy. In extreme cases, a rhizotomy may also be considered for a person suffering from severe back pain or a pinched nerve.In RFA the nerves are burned and will grow back. It is not a permanent procedure. When you have a rhizotomy it is permanent and not reversible. If you are considering having the procedure done I would suggest a RFA first to assure that one, they are treating the correct nerves and two, the procedure will alleviate your pain. A rhizotomy is a very permanent and serious step. I would give this a lot of thought before I consented to the procedure and be assured that are not alternative effective treatments available.Beat of luck and please let us know how you are doing. If you have this procedure done I would be very interested in hearing how successful it is for you. We all learn from one another. Take Care, Tuck",

            "answer": "Thanks for this, Tuck.\u00a0\u00a0First, you're right--it's rhizotomy, not rhivotomy.\u00a0\u00a0Second, the question came up because I asked my sister, who is an M.D. and also suffers from major pain issues, about the radio frequency ablation.\u00a0\u00a0She said that she thought that from my description, RFA sounded like rhizotomy, which she has had about once a quarter for pain treatment.\u00a0\u00a0What she described, though, sounded like RFA, not rhizotomy.\u00a0\u00a0So you can see why I was confused.\u00a0\u00a0Your explanation of rhizotomy has clarified things immensely, and I'm grateful to you.\u00a0\u00a0Let me know what I can do to reciprocate...fpainestam",

            "answer": "I have had RF 2 times in the past year and Im about to get another one but in a different area. I really don't know what the rhizotomy or ablation is exactly. The one I get temproraily kills the nerves. The longest it can last is 6 months. My first one lasted almost 3 months, it helped with my Interstitial Cystis and Vulvodynia and IBS too. If you want anymore info on RF let me know...just PM me.Shell",

            "answer": "Hi Fpainestam,You are welcome. And it is confusing. There are several procedures that sound similar and are similar to the degree that they deaden, disable or destroy the nerve. There are several approaches to all these processes. They all have \"crazy\" names.The rhizotomy, the permanent procedure. It was offered to me some years ago for leg pain. I would have ended up with basically a dead limb. I refused it because of the potential \"side effects.\" I thought of the possibility that I could develop diabetes and have compromised circulation. It is so important for diabetics to be aware of any injuries or wounds to their lower extremities and feet. If a wound goes unnoticed therefore left untreated an infection can develop, become gangrenous and lead to amputation. And with time and better diagnosis, they would have destroyed the wrong nerve. So I am extremely happy that I refused the rhizotomy. I'll live with my sciatica, even though some days I think the pain itself will kill me. lolHow can you reciprocate? That's easy, just stay with us and continue to offer your suggestions for our members. You are a valuable member of this community.Be well, Tuck",
