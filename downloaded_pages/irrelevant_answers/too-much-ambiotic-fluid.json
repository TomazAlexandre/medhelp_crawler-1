            "answer": "You can have too much fluid but it is usually a sign of something else going on like gestational diabetes which would be why they are checking your sugar. Some people develop diabetes later in pregnancy after the standard date of glucose testing. So while too much fluid isn't really by itself a problem it is more indicative of other health problems going on. I would ask your OB tomorrow why they are waiting for so long to get you in to the other dr that's silly you will be in labor by then :P",

            "answer": "They may have you do an amnio bc it can mean abnormalities in the baby. You also will need regular non stress tests. Your baby will be at higher risk for cord prolapse and you are at risk for preterm labor and excessive blood loss post partum. These are just the things I can think of off the top of my head but I don't know chances of any of this happening.",

            "answer": "Thanks! They have tested my sugar again and my levels are fine. I will be doing the non stress tests each week. The doctors think that my baby is just bigger and therefore making for fluid than the average baby. At 34 weeks he was 6 pound and 2 ounces.\u00a0\u00a0So they want me to do a c-section because this baby is tracking to be bigger then my daughter and she was too big for me as well. thanks again",

    "question": "On Monday I help like my water had broken so I went to the hospital. I will be 35 weeks next Monday. While there I learned that i had a UTI and that that was causing contractions.\u00a0\u00a0My baby's heartbeat was acting funny everyonce in a while it dropped.\u00a0\u00a0I think it dropped three times while i was there. My doctor sent me for an ultrasound. I had an ultrasound last night and the ultrasound tech said that everything was good.\u00a0\u00a0Baby looked good, he is about 6 pounds, and everything was good.\u00a0\u00a0He only mentioned that there was enough ambiotic fluid and that it was on the high side, but I got a call from the doctor today saying that there was too much fluid.\u00a0\u00a0So I am not sure what this means.\u00a0\u00a0She said he has too big of a swimming pool.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, I am going for blood work tomorrow to test my blood sugar levels and they are sending me to fetal maternal medicine.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, I panic again but then when they call with my appointment they say January 5!\u00a0\u00a0What!\u00a0\u00a0If it was that important, why wait?\u00a0\u00a0I have a regular appointment tomorrow so maybe I can learn more but I have never heard of having too much fluid.\u00a0\u00a0Has this happened to anyone else?",
