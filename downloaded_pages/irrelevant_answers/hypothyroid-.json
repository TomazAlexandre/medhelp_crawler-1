    "question": "In the past 4 months, i am sleeping 15 out of 24 hours...up only for short time then back to sleep...my feet are numb but not swollen...i do have a history of nodules which havent changed in ten years...blood work: low vitamin d, low T3, my tsh and other thyroid test are normal range...i am experiencing headaches, swelled face, i gained 40 lbs that wont come off even with eating right, and my LDL recently spiked along with borderline diabetes, i check sugar it is always within range...i read that you can have normal readings with a low T3 and have low thyroid...i went to endocrinologist & he said i didnt look tired and my tsh was normal therefore i am not having thyroid problems & he didnt feel my nodules even though he had documentation on the nodules he said they didnt exist either...he didnt believe me when i told him past 3 months just want to sleep...so what do you think...is there any vitamins you can suggest to support thyroid or turn on thyroid while i am suffering to help decrease my symptoms",
