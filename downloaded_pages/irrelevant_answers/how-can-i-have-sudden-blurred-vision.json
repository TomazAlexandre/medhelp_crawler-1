    "question": "My eyes were always perfect. About 5 months ago, after work my eyes suddenly went blurred, i could not focus clearly on anything further than 3 feet away from me. It was as if it would only come in to focus when i came within a certain distance from the object. I saw numerous opticians, doctors and opthamologists and had mixed reports. The optician prescribed me glasses but couldn't explain the sudden blurring of vision. Doctors could not explain it either and said that if the glasses helped then i should wear them. Then i saw an opthamologist who said my eyes were perfect and that i should never have been prescribed glasses in the first place! At that stage i got a ct scan down and everything was clear, i also had blood tests done and nothing came back unusual. It is now months after and my eyes are still blurred, especially if i am tired. I have also had a constant headache for the past 3 weeks that i cant seem to shake. What do you think is wrong with me?",
