            "answer": "Difficult to say without evaluation.Muscle twitching can be due to a variety of neurological conditions, ALS being the most serious.\u00a0\u00a0An EMG or nerve conduction studies can be considered to evaluate this.\u00a0\u00a0You can also consider a spinal MRI if central lesions are suspected.With the pain in the ears, you can consider a brain MRI as well.Metabolic causes can lead to some neurological symptoms like the prickling feeling or neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0Blood tests can evaluate for thyroid problems, diabetes or B12 deficiency.I would consider a referral to a neurologist to further evaluate the symptoms.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

            "answer": "Thanks Doc, I appreciate the response.\u00a0\u00a0I'm curious (and I am not a doctor) - why do you suspect it isn't benign fasciculation syndrome?\u00a0\u00a0I have an appointment to see my GP about these issues, but if you don't mind could you offer some advice on what can be done to treat BFS, just in case it helps in the meantime?Thanks again, I truly appreciate it.",

            "answer": "Diagnosis of BFS is a \"diagnosis of exclusion,\" in other words, other likely causes for the twitching (mostly forms of neuropathy, such as borreliosis (Lyme disease) neuropathy, motor neuron diseases such as ALS, etc) must be eliminated before BFS can be assumed. An important diagnostic tool here is the electromyography (EMG). Since BFS appears to cause no actual nerve damage (at least as seen on the EMG), a completely normal EMG (or one where the only abnormality seen is fasciculations) largely eliminates more serious disorders and strongly suggests BFS.",

    "question": "I've been having intermittent muscle spasms for a little over a week. 25/M. They're not painful when they happen but they do cause anxiety. I haven't changed my diet, and believe I'm getting enough electrolytes/calcium/potassium... I take an adult multivitamin as well. BP averages 120/80.The spasms occur in my arms, legs, hands, neck, and sometimes in my face.\u00a0\u00a0Today they have been mostly in my left arm causing my thumb to twitch.\u00a0\u00a0This has caused soreness and tingling in my left arm/hand/fingertips, although mild.\u00a0\u00a0But the spasms happen throughout my body.I have some other symptoms which may or may not be related.\u00a0\u00a0Occasionally I get a pricking feeling on my skin in random areas.\u00a0\u00a0They're not that troublesome and are not my primary concern.\u00a0\u00a0Also, a few months ago I had a couple weeks of a stabbing pain in my ears.\u00a0\u00a0This has gone away but occasionally comes back, though not every day.\u00a0\u00a0I also had acid reflux causing palpitations earlier this year.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if any of this is related, but I thought I'd put it out there.\u00a0\u00a0My main concern is the recurring muscle spasms (and the ear thing, if it ever comes back like it was).Any suggestions?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your help.",
