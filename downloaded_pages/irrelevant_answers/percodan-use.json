            "answer": "Hello coolbreez and welcome to the Pain Forum:Sorry that your Mom is unwell. An abscessed tooth can cause many problems. Putting the pain aside, it can cause a sever infection if left untreated. This infection can travel through her blood stream causing great harm. Also, it has been noted that unhealthy teeth or gum disease can lead to heart problems. So yes, the abscess is causing damage everyday it is not treated.As far as her Percodan use, how is it prescribed? that will tell you if she is taking too much or abusing it. If she is requiring that much Percodan maybe it is in her best interest to move up to a long acting pain medication. There are many out on the market today. She really needs to speak with her Doctor about it. Anyway, to sum this up, check the bottle and see how many she is allowed per day and go from there.One quick note...have you spoke with your Mom about her pain med intake and what her pain level is? That would be a good idea.Please take care and good luck in helping your Mom. It's nice that you care so much and are concerned.My best,Mollyrae",

            "answer": "Hello Coolbreeze,I am sorry about your mom's pain. I agree that you should check the label and see how many she is prescribed per day. If it is 5mg of oxycodone and she is taking 10mg (two) at a time that means she had about 22 doses in a week or took it 3 times per day. That it not excessive.\u00a0\u00a0However if the tablet are 10mg than that seems to be a bit over the top. So it is important to know what the dosage is and how it is prescribed.Absences left untreated can cause other medical problems, some of them serious and live threatening. It is encouraging that she is scheduled to have the tooth removed. I would guess that if she does not currently display any other symptoms she may have dodged the complications that can come for an abscess tooth.Diabetes can affect cardiac status as can tooth and gum disease. This would be my first concern. You may want to ask you mom to allow you to accompany her on her next PCP visit and address this issue with him/her. Get involved in your mom's medical care/visits if she will allow it. She is lucky to have you concerned and involved in her health care. So many elderly have no one involved or concerned.Good luck to you. Caring for our parents can be very frustrating and heart breaking. I know as I am currently caring for mine. Please keep in touch. We are here to support you in anyway we can. I wil look forward to your updates.Take care, Tuck",

            "answer": "Just one more thing on the Percodan. If she is taking that much of it there is 325 mg. of aspirin in each pill. That is alot of aspirin to consume even for a younger person. It could cause bleeding problems in the stomach and intestines as well as excessive bruising.I agree with Molly in regards to asking a doctor to change her medication to something long acting or even just Oxycodone with no other additives such as aspirin or acetomenophin. It is available in 5mg and 10mg doses.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Unfortunately oxycodone without aspirin or acetaminophen is impossible to obtain of late. There is a problem with the manufacture. So Percocet or Percodan (or their generic) is the only choice when it comes to short acting oxycodone.Aspirin therapy should not exceed 12 (325mg) tablets in a 24 hour periods. I appears Coolbreez's mom was not in danger of exceeding that but it is a good point to consider. I am hopeful that the pharmacy (and MD) is \"watching\" the consumption of her aspirin. Indeed my pharmacy chain contacted my physician when they thought I was even getting close to reaching the top recommended dose of aspirin/acetaminophen. They are held responsible for what they dispense and are very astute on tracking medications.In the elderly SR medications tend to build up in the system more so than in younger ppl. That is basically due to their slower metabolism and their inability to rid their systems of drugs as effectively. Diabetes can also add greatly to that issue. She may do better on the short acting medication but that is certainly a call and consideration for her physician.Just thinking out loud, Tuck",
