    "question": "Hi, I have visited many gynecologist's in regards to my issue and have had many tests ran however all the test results show that I have no health issues.For over a year now I have suffered from a horrible vaginal odor, profuse vaginal sweating that is hightened when I find myself irritated or working out. I also have burning, and itching.I began this journey by using a towel that belonged to a man that had one identical to mine. After this happened I noticed he had many towels within his bedroom that he used to wipe his genital area due to profuse sweating and the towels had a fungus like or yeast like odor to them. I also noticed within his bedroom many containers of fungus cream for his genitals.I have mainly noticed the burning and itching on the right side of my labia and within my vagina. The left side of my vagina and labia appear to be fine. I have also noticed that my left labia is now larger than the right and the left labia feels different as well.My question now is, any idea of what I could have? What tests should I request when I do go to the doctor? Is there a different doctor that I should go to?Please help! I know that something is wrong. My life has not been the same since these symptoms started. I am extremely embarrassed and hope not to live with this issue for the rest of my life.",
