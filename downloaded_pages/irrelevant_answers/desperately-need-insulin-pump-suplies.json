            "answer": "Dear Demm,We volunteers on this Forum work closely with a sister-initiative also sponsored by Juvenile Diabetes Research FOundation and THAT group does have a specialist whom you can work with to get info on what's available in your state.\u00a0\u00a0That initiative is called Online Diabetes Support Team (ODST).As posted to \"Vader418,\" a while back, the best way to reach that specialist is this:Go to the website, www.jdrf.org and click on the link on the left side of the page under the header \"Newly Diagnosed\" (it's NOT just for newly diagnosed), \"Online Diabetes Support Team (ODST)\". You will be taken to a page where you can fill out a short form to give some information about your issue(like what you wrote here).Your request will be sent directly to someone who is moderating the ODST program right now and THAT person will ensure the specialist gets in touch with you.\u00a0\u00a0ODST allows for much more personal interactions, that we cannot do here on the Forum.\u00a0\u00a0Since we work closely with them, please mention that you \"heard about\" ODST here at MedHelp/JDRF Forum.I'm sure you'll learn a lot from the specialist at ODST and I wish you & your dear son very well.",

            "answer": "Please do what JDRF Team LRS suggested. A woman who is affiliated with JDRF has contacted us and has offered to send you some supplies, and the only way we can put her in contact with you is through the ODST. I am attempting now to get this woman who has made the offer of Mini Med 508 model supplies (an unopened box is available) to agree to let us forward her e-mail address to the ODST so that she can be put in contact with you if you contact them. I hope to send her offer to them in a day or two (as soon as I have her formal agreement to let me forward her e-mail address).",
