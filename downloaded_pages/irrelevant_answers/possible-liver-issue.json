    "question": "Hi my daughter is 2 yrs old. We had labs done a month ago because she wants food all the time like she doesnt get full. Her AST and ALP levels were high. So we came back a month later to do labs again. Well those levels are still high and the immunoglobin a&g were borderline low, as well as globulin. We will be seeing a specialist but i am stumped. It all points to the liver but wondering if its something that is slowly appearing. Any help or advice would be appreciated thanks/",
