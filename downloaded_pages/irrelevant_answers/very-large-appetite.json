    "question": "I am a 20 year old college student. I am 6'1.5\" and 175 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0My problem is that I have an abnormally large appetite.\u00a0\u00a0This is not new, my mother first noticed it when I was 11. My great grandfather had a reputation for a very large appetite and she though I might have some gene from him which was causing this.\u00a0\u00a0During High School I was checked for hyperthyroidism and diabetes etc., but they never found a cause.\u00a0\u00a0They even took a stool sample to see if I was digesting my food correctly.\u00a0\u00a0They told me my appetite may decrease when I got older.\u00a0\u00a0I has a little.\u00a0\u00a0I probably ate the most in 9th or 10th grade, but I have been the same for at least two years.\u00a0\u00a0I think I eat 2x to 3x what most of my friends do.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have any other medical problems and when I am at home and I can eat what I want, everything is fine.\u00a0\u00a0At college, I am alway getting hungry at funny times.\u00a0\u00a0I eat in the dorms and always go back for seconds at least.\u00a0\u00a0Even then I often get hungry in the afternoon and almost always at night.\u00a0\u00a0Many people comment about my appetite and seem to think it is really, really large.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I am even embarressed to tell people when I am hungry because they will think it is so strange.\u00a0\u00a0I would like to know if anyone else has had an experience like this.\u00a0\u00a0I would like to know about any causes for a large appetite, and I am especially interested to know if someone has heard of a genetic cause.\u00a0\u00a0Also I would like to know if there is a way to control it.ThanksRob",
