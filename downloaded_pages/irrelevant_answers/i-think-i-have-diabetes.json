I know people here have actually been diagnosed and have suffered through the ailment and it was insensitive to complain when I don't even know yet.I just feel so sure I have it, and I suppose I'm scared.",

            "answer": "\"I just feel so sure I have it, and I suppose I'm scared.\"Sometimes symptoms can be false positives so it will depend on the fasting test results to figure out where you're at - normal, prediabetic or diabetic. If your results are positive [+126 mg/dl or +7 mmol/l] you would be considered diabetic. If you are positive your doctor should order an A1c [hemoglobin A1c] test as verification because the fasting test only measures your glucose [blood sugar] at the time of the test, not what it was an hour prior, the day or week before. Post back to this thread if you have questions on your results. In the meantime calm down, no need to get worked up.",

            "answer": "I agree with waverider, and as someone who has lived with a very cranky diabetic for some time, I can understand your concern. BUT, you are only 23, treatments have changed dramatically in the past few years, and scientists are well on the way to making things even easier, if not at the cure stage just yet. Having said all that, I'm not so sure you are diabetic, your symptoms are very common in young men, especially those who work out, eat (mostly) right and work hard. If the worst case scenario happens, just from reading your post, I do believe that you will be able to not only cope, but be a good influence on other young men going through the same thing. Good Luck xxx",

    "question": "Hi,I went to my doctor last week because of some problems maintaining a strong erection. I can still achieve an erection but it doesn't feel as strong as it used to and it goes down pretty quickly. He said at my age (23) it would most likely be a psychological problem but ordered up some blood tests anyway.The blood tests showed my hormone levels to be normal but that my blood sugar was \"slightly high\" (in their words). I went back today for the fasting blood glucose test and will get the result mid-week next week. I had a fizzy drink and a sandwich shortly before taking the original test so figured that was the cause of the high sugar level. I'm healthy, I exercise, I'm thin and I don't eat lots of sweets or junk food.So, on the bus home I experienced a metallic taste in my mouth. Not unfamiliar, but not something I've kept any tabs on. I used my phone to google it and it turns out it's a symptom of diabetes. The same page also mentioned that up to 75% of men with diabetes suffered from erectile dysfunction - symptom number 2. Now that I think about it, my Dad used to always say \"are you going to the toilet AGAIN?\" when we'd be watching TV - symptom 3. And recently I've sometimes noticed a strong odour from my urine - symptom 4. Add in the high blood sugar test and I feel confident that I will be diagnosed with diabetes.I'm so ******* pissed off, and I don't know what to do. I read the likely complications; blindness, foot amputation, ED... and I feel cheated. I'm not overweight, I don't live a sedentary lifestyle, I'm only ******* 23... I honestly feel like if they give me insulin I'll just inject the whole ******* lot and bypass the slow debilitating descent to death.When I think about it... I could have had these symptoms for years. I always used to sleep in for high school and I used to tell my mother that I was just too tired, not lazy. I think, at one point, I was actually tested for diabetes because of those complaints - she would remember better than me.I never realised what a terrible condition diabetes could be. I never thought I'd get it. Maybe I'm being pessimistic, but logic dictates that with so many symptoms I probably have it. I'm lost :(",
