            "answer": "I haven't taken mine yet, but I've heard that it means your baby has a better chance of being a larger baby? And that some doctors want to induce women who have GD at like 37 or 38 weeks? I think you can decline them doing that, but I'm sure it's safer to follow what they advise! Good luck <3 all will be okay!",

            "answer": "I was recently diagnosed with gd.. doctor basically gave me a script for a glucometer, lancets and test strips to check your blood sugar regularly and they may have you adjust your diet. .also I am sent for extra growth scans to keep an eye on baby as well....In the worst cases some women may need medication to keep their sugar regulated...ultimately the risks to baby outnumber those to mom, it's very important for babys development that mom's sugar is controlled.",

        {
            "answer": "My suggestion to you would be to not stress about it and just be diligent about checking your sugar. Stress can inhibit your body's ability to produce insulin which makes it harder to process sugar....also, It doesn't hurt if once in a while it's a little high but overall your sugar needs to be within the guidelines set by your doctor.",
