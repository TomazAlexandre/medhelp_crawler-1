    "question": "I recently went to Urgent Care for for a UTI and I mentioned to the attending doctor that I had felt really tired and run down the past week. She ordered some blood work and I got my results today. She said everything was fine except my blood sugar level was 31. The doctor said that normal levels are between 65 and 100. I've looked online a bit and it looks like this can mean I have diabetes. I felt pretty tired when I had my blood drawn but I had eaten earlier in the day (maybe 2 hours before) and I hadn't exercised. I'm not sure what would cause my blood sugar to be that low! I'm going to follow up with my regular doctor but was curious if there was anything out there that can cause this or if there are other resources that I can research. I'm otherwise generally healthy, I have an active lifestyle, exercise regularly, eat pretty healthy, and have a healthy BMI. Diabetes Type II does run in my family however. thanks",
