            "answer": "Great work losing 30 pounds! Too early to tell if you will ovulate, but hopefully the combination of metformin and clomid will work. If the current clomid dose does not work, your REI will probably want to increase the dose. Your chances with clomid and metformin of ovulating are probably around 65%. If clomid does not work, fertility injection medications may have a better chance - but they are a second choice since they come with a much higher risk of multiple pregnancy and are more expensive. Your weight is the issue regarding ovulation, and puts your pregnancy at greater risk for C-section (any surgery is more risky the greater a person's weight is), blood pressure disorders, gestational diabetes. The more weight you can lose, the better your chances of getting pregnant, and the safer your pregnancy will be. You ultimately need to be the person to decide when you want to get pregnant and at what weight - although you are playing the odds a bit getting pregnant at your weight, bear in mind that most overweight women ultimately deliver healthy babies in the end. Keep up the good work.",

            "answer": "Hi,\u00a0\u00a0I had to lose almost 40 lbs before my IVF so it would increase my chances of conception.\u00a0\u00a0Though hormones were good and the clomid challenge good, I was unable to conceive even with IUI.\u00a0\u00a0My wonderful RE felt weight was a grave issue and would have had me wait a year and lose a lot of weight in that year but my age was an issue.\u00a0\u00a0I am near 200 lbs now and got pregnant first IVF.\u00a0\u00a0The research supports that weight is a very important factor in fertility though not the only factor.\u00a0\u00a0You need to speak openly with your RE and talk about the lab results and other issues that may be holding you back.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
