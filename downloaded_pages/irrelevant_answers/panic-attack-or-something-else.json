            "answer": "Hi, yes I have had that happen before. But when I get panic attacks I don't get hungry. Yes it's true that when your blood sugar is low you can feel everything you were describing but that doesn't mean you have diabetes. Usually when I wake up in the middle of the night or real early, I feel so so sick and all I have to do is eat crackers or something and the feeling goes away! I guess it's just something that happens sometimes :/ You should carry snacks with you just in case.",

    "question": "Hi I have been diagnosed with anxiety and panic attacks. Today I had a panic attack, was sweating, shaking and dizzy. I also felt like eating something while I had it so I ate a banana and bread, I have had this before. So now I have read that something similar happens when your blood sugar is low or have diabetes. So now I am worried I have diabetes or something serious other than panic attacks. Does this happen with panic attacks too? Does\u00a0\u00a0anyone else have this? Thx for reading.",
