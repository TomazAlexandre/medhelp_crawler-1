            "answer": "My father has the same damage as what you are speaking of. I did some research of the use of Co Enzyme Q10. It is a natural supplement that are hearts contain. Dr's do not tell you unless tell them. If you hae been on any statin drugs they can actually deplete you heart of this natural enzyme that it needs to function properly. In my Dad's case I mention my findings to the cardiologist and asked him if it would be okay to supplement this along with all medications. My father was entering stage 4 of congestive heart failure and remarkably after a couple of weeks all the fluid was gone, he had no swelling, was able to breath, no shortness of breath and was able to walk with out feeling out of breath. If you do your research, you willl find that patients who had almost given up, have had their lives extended to a better quality of life. Q10 will actually strengthen your heart and help it function better. Check with you Doctor before taking this, just to make sure that it doesn't interfere with the drugs.",

            "answer": "Hi,These survival rates are generalized for the population and may not necessarily have the same meaning for a particular individual. They just give a rough idea about the average survival. Survival is also dependent upon the extent of damage to the myocardium and the severity of the CHF. EF is one of the important baseline parameters to give an idea about the status of the CHF and thus is commonly used in deciding about the long term prognosis. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure almost a year ago. I have also had a heart attach and 50% of my lower heart is damaged. I have read the average survival rate after being diagnosed with congestive heart failure is 50% at 5 years and 20% at 8 to 12 years. Is this correct?",
