    "question": "I am 58years old and have hypothyroidism, and my latest results came back;FreeT4\u00a0\u00a013.1 pmol/l\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TSH 16.40 mIU/lI am concerned I have adrenal insufficiency,as I have complete exhaustion, find it hard to wake up, let alone get through the day.\u00a0\u00a0 All my white blood cells are low and I have neutropenia. My muscles are so painful, and sore to touch. They fasiculate, my CKmm is 414. I also get numbness and tingling.\u00a0\u00a0 Terrible back pain just above the waistline.\u00a0\u00a0Cholesterol at 9. Alk Phos 144.\u00a0\u00a0Suffer horrendous vertigo with sickness, terrible funny headaches and eyesight goes blurry. I could go on but I am so fed up of it all.\u00a0\u00a0Feel I have suffered for over 10 years, after a perriod of extreme prolonged stress. I was rushed into hospital once unconscious for 7 hours, was found cold, with blue lips, was given equivalent of 30 teasp. sugar and heaps of salt. When I got to hospital I was still unconscious, and hypoglycaemic, they gave me Saline,\u00a0\u00a0next day they tested for Addisons. Negative result. Now am I right in thinking that after all that salt and sugar a test so soon after treatment would be useless.\u00a0\u00a0I have been tested for diabetes also negative. I was started on thyroxine about 3 years ago and the dose keeps on going up, now at 150mg a day, the dosage stays fine for a few months then I just seem to need more. ...Please give me some advice!\u00a0\u00a0By the way my son has Addisons and Type1 Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Also my mother had all these symptoms when she died. My older sister also suffers from most of them",
