            "answer": "You might want to see your Dr to find out what's going on. Are you having any other symptoms like being more thirsty? If I were you, I would ask for a blood sugar test. This may not be the what's going on but it's best to be checked for diabetes.",

            "answer": "You don't have to be thirsty to have diabetes, and I'm not saying that's the problem. It would be a good idea to be checked for it though. Actually, just the opposite could be going on. Low blood sugar. I know you have to stand up alot at work and that could be a problem if your not getting breaks and sitting. Are you eating and drinking enough throughout the day?",

            "answer": "I have just started eating and drinking more. Some one else told me I needed to be doing that. I checked my blood sugar one morning, before eating and it was spot on.Would low blood sugar cause you to feel bad all the time, or just once in a while when your blood sugar drops?",

            "answer": "Low blood sugar could cause you to feel bad when it's happening. As long as your eating on a regular basis, every 3 to 4 hours, it should'nt be dropping. I'm not talking about a full meal. Having a healthy snack in between meals is a good idea.What was your number when you checked it that morning?Would it be possible to see a Dr for some testing?",

    "question": "I am a 30 year old male. I have always been healthy. My job requires me to be on my feet a lot so I get a lot of walking in during the day. Lately I have been very tired, exhausted actually. Some times I have blurred vision, or a\u00a0\u00a0weak, tired, spacey feeling.\u00a0\u00a0I have also had to urge to pee often. I do not take any medications, eat well, sleep well, take vitamins and am not over weight. I'm at a loss for what is causing these issues.",
