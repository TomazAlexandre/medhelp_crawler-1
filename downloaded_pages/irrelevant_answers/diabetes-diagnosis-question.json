I am having these symptoms which use to be infrequent have turned frequent! This has all happened within a months time.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any answers?Sincerely,Francine",

            "answer": "Lucy, you really don't make clear if you are a type 2 diabetic and if so what treatment you are on. Your blood sugar is too high (156 a bit and 273 very). You need to change your diet to limit your carb intake. If you are doing this, getting regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight then you need to be prescribed medications. If you are already taking meds then you still need to see your doctor for a change to a regimen that will control your blood sugar.",

            "answer": "I'm unsure why you tailgated onto this thread instead of opening your own new post. To answer your concern -\"I took the A1C Blood Test and my results were 6.2 (143.4)\"What is 143.4? An A1c of 6.2% equates to daily glucose average of 131 mg/dl. Also, wherever you read 6.2% as prediabetes is incorrect. Diabetes is classified starting at 6% or 126 mg/dl.Unless you are willing to eat a proper nutrition, exercise daily, maintain normal body no diabetes medication will make you normal. They help you to lower your blood sugar levels only if you do the aforementioned. Ignore these lifestyle changes and diabetes will gradually progress with more and more severe side effects.With high CRP and SED rates something else is going on inside your body besides diabetes. When you see your doctor be sure to go over all your lab results. Pay attention not only to those that are marked High, or marked Low, buts also to any that are borderline. Good luck -",
