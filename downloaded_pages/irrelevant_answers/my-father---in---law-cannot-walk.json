    "question": "Hi everyone.\u00a0\u00a0I just had a question.\u00a0\u00a0My father - in - law had a heart attack about a year & one half ago.\u00a0\u00a0He drank/smoked most of his life, but as soon as he had the attack, quit smoking & cut down on his drinking.\u00a0\u00a0In the last five months he started to limp & is now dragging both feet, having losts of back pain and is falling alot.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors claimed they couldn't find anything wrong until he told them he had brain surgery in the early 1980's.\u00a0\u00a0They have now said that his brain has atrophied (sp?) & it is because of the brain surgery he had back almost 30 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I think it seems convenient to blame it on that.\u00a0\u00a0I think they just don't know & don't want to admit it.\u00a0\u00a0They say in less than one year he will be in a wheelchair.\u00a0\u00a0Please help!\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know of this happening to anyone else?",
