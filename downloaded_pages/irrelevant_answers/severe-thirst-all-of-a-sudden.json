    "question": "Im 16 weeks pregnant today with baby #2 and all of a sudden today i cant seem to get enough to drink. Just today since about 730-1230 ive drank about 3/4 gallon of water juice milk mostly water though. I have a dr appointment friday and will ask then but was wondering if this is normal as i dont remember having this the first time around. Also this doesnt feel like the normal dehydration. I get dehydrated easily so im constantly trying to push fluids but am never actually thirsty. Then all of a sudden today BOOM thirst like crazy and nothing quenches it! Im in wisconsin and its cold out so heat is not a problem. Ive even tried a popsicle but it made me too cold lol.",
