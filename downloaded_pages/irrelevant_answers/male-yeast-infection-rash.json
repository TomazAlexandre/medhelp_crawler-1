            "answer": "Hello,I cannot confirm anything without examination but it can be erythrasma. Erythrasma is a chronic superficial infection of the intertriginous areas of the skin.It is true that groins are effected but the typical appearance is well-demarcated, brown-red macular patches. The skin has a wrinkled appearance with fine scales.Wood lamp examination and gram staining are the tests for its diagnosis.The standard therapy of erythrasma is antibiotics and antifungals because it is caused by a bacteria C minutissimum.Erythromycin is the drug of choice.Mild steroids are helpful in reducing the inflammation associated with it. But use it only after a dermatologist,s prescription.Hope it helps. Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",
