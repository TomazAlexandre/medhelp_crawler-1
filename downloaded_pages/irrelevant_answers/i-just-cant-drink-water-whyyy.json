            "answer": "Carbonated drinks are really very acidic so drinking only carbonated drinks makes you more likely to develop chronic heart burn or acid reflux disease. Coffee is similarly acidic, although may be less depending on if you use milk in it. The sugar content in these drinks are also cause for concern, because they can make you gain weight and have a higher risk for weight related issues like diabetes type II and heart problems. Even if you use fake sugar, that still has some influence on your weight and I've read that one of them (aspartame I think) scientists recently discovered was addictive in a similar way that the body becomes addicted to nicorette or caffeine.Your ways of quitting are similar to any other kind of habit. Cold turkey. Just switch to plain water, juices, etc. Or you could do it in steps. Drink carbonated water or flavor water with something non sugary. I personally found it easier to just stop buying anything milk or 100% juice. My mom however found it easier to switch to crystal lite or tea than to plain water.",
