    "question": "45 year old male excellent health planning on training for a marathon so I asked my Family Physician if I could have a Stress Test. He felt it was not necessary because I had no risk factors. He then decided to have me undergo a cadriolite stress test (against his advice).My history- 45 year old male- Physical Education teacher...very active- Non-smoker- 1 glass of red wine a day- one 81 mg aspirin/day. Multiple Vitamin and omega 3's- jogging 3-5/week 40minutes for the past 20 years. Weight train regularly 2x/wk- no hx of high blood pressure or high cholesterol or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Annual Physical results have all been excellent..- Height 5'11.5\" and weight 173-175 lbs- stress test and echo in 1989\u00a0\u00a0PAC's noted and Incomplete RBBB, advised that was normal from cardiologist and family physician.- no chest pain experienced at rest or during exercise.- resting heart rate around 60b/min.- no risk factors to mention other than what has been mentioned above.Results from MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION STUDY (STRESS)Stress ECG Report: At REst Pulse was 63 and BP was 118/90. Resting ECG Normal.The patient exercsied for 13 minutes and 31 seconds on treadmill according to Bruce protocol and achieved 16 METS with peak pulse of 176 which is 101% of maximum and BP of 210/85.During exercise there were PAC's but no Ischemic ECG changes or chest symptoms.TOMOGRAPHIC MYOCADIAL PERFUSION REPORT: The stress myocardial perfusion tomograms show mild decrease in the proximal two-thirds of the inferior wall which improves at rest.The gated images shw normal wall motion.\u00a0\u00a0The rest eject fraction is 44% and the post stress ejection fraction is 48%OPINION: although the decrease in the proximal inferior wall could be secondary to diphragmatic attenuation artifact.\u00a0\u00a0I think there is some improvement at rest and ischemia in the RCA territory cannot be excluded.Dr.(Consultant Cardiologist)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and Dr. (Nuclear Phusician)I am really worried now.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe I should have not asked for the Stress Test and listened to my Doctor.\u00a0\u00a0He suggested we either redo the test or refer to a Cardiologist at teaching hospitalAs soon as I eft the office I went for a a nice 40 minute run no chest pain or shortnes of breath was noted. Should I increase my dosage of baby aspirin? do you think they will recommend another cardiolite test or angiogram?I think I might have to wait a while for the appoinment.What's your impression or guess?\u00a0\u00a0I'm worried. What shoud I expect. I enjoy running and exercising.",
