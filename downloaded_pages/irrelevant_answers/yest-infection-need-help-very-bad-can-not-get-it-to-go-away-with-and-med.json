            "answer": "try to stay away from suger because sugar feeds yeast and can make it worse. also try to stay away from starchy foods because the starch turns to sugar in your system. eat a lot of yogurt and take an acidophillus supplement. you can get it over the counter from the pharmacy. when i take it i double the dose, unless its really really bad then i triple it. hope you get better!",
