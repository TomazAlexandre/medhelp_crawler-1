            "answer": "Hi,The iced tea may be contributory.Another thing to consider is that the problem may not be with obstruction but with the bladder. There are some age related changes in the capacity of the bladder to determine when it is full to capacity and hence there is a tendency to empty even when the bladder is not yet really full.There are a studies that determine the dynamics of the bladder.
