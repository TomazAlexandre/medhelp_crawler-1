            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!The swelling and numbness of hands and feet could be due to water retention as in low protein in blood, kidney problems, heart problems, severe anemia, deep vein thrombosis, liver diseases etc. It could be due to hypothyroidism too. Diabetes Mellitus too can cause similar symptoms. Venous pooling is another possibility. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
