    "question": "I have had shingles since approx February. The first month I didn't experience any pain (that I could remember) just the rash. Now I am experiencing pain and itch. (Not great pain but burning and tingling here and there).When I first noticed the rash I was in Jamaica for my wedding and it was on my stomach. I wasn't worried and thought of it as a \"stress rash\" but a couple weeks later it started travelling around my side in the \"belt like\" fashion. When I realized it was spreading I went to my doc. He told me I had shingles but if I wasn't suffering complications then there was nothing to really do about it. I went back a month later b/c it was still not gone and I had started experiencing tingling, burning and itch. He put me on Flamclivor (can't remember the exact name). 3 and 1/2 months later I am still suffering. I have started taking extra vitamin C and lysine, Omega 3's and flaxseed oil now. Since taking Lysine I've noticed that it is more itchy and more sensitive when clothes touch the area.Finally what I'm wondering is if the Lysine is essentially helping the rash come along?Does the rash have to erupt and puss in order for it to go away?What other things can I possibly do for this to go away?Should I put myself on a detox?",
