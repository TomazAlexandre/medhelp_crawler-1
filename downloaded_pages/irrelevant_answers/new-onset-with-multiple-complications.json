            "answer": "Hello friendoftype1,I am a volunteer, not a medical professional, so\u00a0\u00a0my input / advice is based on personal experience from taking care of my son (now 10) who was diagnosed at age 3.You are a wonderful friend to be so involved and caring.\u00a0\u00a0I applaud you.\u00a0\u00a0Many people do not understand the seriousness of this disease and you sound like a great support for her mother.Honestly, I am unfamiliar with hyperlipidemia.\u00a0\u00a0I only know it has something to do with cholesterol.Sorry, I do not know of a good Pediatric Endocrinologist in Tennessee, but you are right in wanting your friend's daughter to be seen by one.\u00a0\u00a0She definitely needs a \"Pediatric\" Endocrinologist.As far as: \"Is it normal to have all of these other issues so early on?\"\u00a0\u00a0I am unsure how to answer that.\u00a0\u00a0My assumption would be to say it would depend on how long the individual had type 1 before being diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0We were lucky that our son had only exhibited symptoms for a couple of weeks when we realized there was something not right and requested he be tested for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He then had a 3 day stay at Children's Hospital, so we could learn as much as possibel about how to care for him and so the Doctors could find an appropriate insulin dosage.How many days was she in the hospital when diagnosed?\u00a0\u00a0It is evident from the great fluctuation in her blood sugars that her Endocrinologist needs to make adjustments to her insulin dosage / schedule.\u00a0\u00a0Was your friend told what type of meal plan to follow?Here is a link you might want to look at.\u00a0\u00a0It will take you to the East Tennessee Children's Hospital Diabetes Clinic.http://www.etch.com/tourdiab.cfmYou will receive comments in regards to your posting from other volunteers who have a lot of knowledge when it comes to the medical side of type 1 and its effects.Warm Regards",

            "answer": "You might be able to get some help finding a pediatric endo by visiting this JDRF forum's main page and clicking on the link to the Online Diabetes Support Team.\u00a0\u00a0There's also a link to it from the JDRF main website (www.jdrf.org) ... and there it's labelled something like \"New to Diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0YOu're not Alone\"The Online Diabetes Support Team, unlike our very public forum, is a place where individual volunteers ... in the community where help is being requested ... work one on one.\u00a0\u00a0YOu or your friend will be contacted by a JDRF volunteer \"matched\" to the particular circumstance.\u00a0\u00a0In your friend's case, they'd look for a parent of an adolescent ... or a parent whose child went thru adolescence with diabetes.In general, honeymoons can last a year or so.\u00a0\u00a0It's a time when a lot of learning, trial & error, frustrations & victories, come fast & furious.\u00a0\u00a0Keeping good records of every little detail can sometimes help us find patterns in the chaos.\u00a0\u00a0It is not uncommon for Type 1s to have other autoimmune problems.\u00a0\u00a0Type 1 is an autoimmune disease, and so our immune systems are thought to be hypersensitive in general.You are wonderful friend, indeed.\u00a0\u00a0Learn all you can & know that being a shoulder for your friend is a fabulous gift.\u00a0\u00a0It can feel lonely and scary ... and the feeling of powerlessness to fully protect one's child can be devastating.",

    "question": "My friends daughter (age 12) was recently (about 3 months ago) diagnosed with type 1.\u00a0\u00a0She has, up until now, done pretty good with keeping levels between 60 & 200.\u00a0\u00a0Her MD told her to be prepared that she was in the honeymoon phase.\u00a0\u00a0This past weekend she started having wide swings in her levels from 30 to 300.\u00a0\u00a0Her labwork has indicated that she also has hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia.\u00a0\u00a0They are already talking about islet cell transplant and are sending her to a retinologist.\u00a0\u00a0Is it normal to have all of these other issues so early on?\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know a good pediatric endocrinologist in Tennessee?",
