Can't win for losing some time.But just know this.\u00a0\u00a0Getting the thyroid to work right for you again takes time. It takes trial and error.\u00a0\u00a0And what works for me, may not work for you.\u00a0\u00a0so you just need to experiment here and there.\u00a0\u00a0Be patient.\u00a0\u00a0Take it one step at a time.\u00a0\u00a0You are on your way.
