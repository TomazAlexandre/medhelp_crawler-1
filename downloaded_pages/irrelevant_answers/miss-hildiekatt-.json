            "answer": "Hildie's been eating a bit less than usual, but the vet says that diabetic cats will often eat a lot to try and make up the nutrient deficit.Hopefully, she's just back to a normal kitty \"mousie size\" portion regimen; had a bit of my beefsteak at lunch time, which she has not done in awhile.Her energy level seems good, goes up and down all the stairs just fine.\u00a0\u00a0She likes to sleep under our bed, but is out and about being social (will even nap in the living room if we're home), walks around tail straight up in the air...like to have lap time and be petted.So, we are hoping she just got a little gut trouble that will respond.",

    "question": "Just got back from the vet with Miss Hildiekatt.\u00a0\u00a0her blood glucose level was nicely in the normal range after 2 weeks off insulin.\u00a0\u00a0So, it looks like she is in remission.We discussed the weight loss she's had over the past 9 months (5#), which is much more symmetrical along her body than the muscle wasting she had before we got the diabetes under control.Doc think maybe intestinal parasites (sample sent to the lab for analysis), so Hildie got a topical wormer applied, which is good as I do not know how we'd be able to pill her.\u00a0\u00a0Also got a medication to relieve what the vet thinks is a little intestinal inflammation.Otherwise, all of her blood work looked good; heart, lungs, eyes, coat and all good, too.",
