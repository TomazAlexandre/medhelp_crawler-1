    "question": "Dr, Schiano,My husband had a liver transplant on August 5, 2008.\u00a0\u00a0Reason for transplant was suspicious lesion on his liver as a result of 30+ years of chronic HCV.\u00a0\u00a0Other than a bout of rejection in late Jan. 2009 brought on, the hepatologist thinks, by the Pegasys treatment that he began and had to discontinue, he has done exceedingly well in terms of resuming a normal life.\u00a0\u00a0His AST and ALT are now starting to edge upward.\u00a0\u00a0Yesterday's labs showed that his ALT had increased from 246 to 379, a large increase.\u00a0\u00a0His Total Bilirubin was .7 and Indirect Bilirubin was .1.\u00a0\u00a0Creatinine was 1.0.\u00a0\u00a0So all of those tests look good.\u00a0\u00a0He has to do labs in another week and maybe another biopsy--he's already had 5 or 6. Since the diabetes caused by the meds is improving, he recently switched from injectable insulin (lantus and novolog) to Glimiperide (1/2 mg daily).\u00a0\u00a0Could this be causing the elevation in LFTs or do you think it's definitely the HCV?Thank you for your advice.",
