I go back in again soon and will ask for these tests.the specialist said at this time, it was 50/50... 50% that it would help and 50% that it wouldn't make a bit of difference so they opted for no surgery at this time to remove the gall bladder.\u00a0\u00a0As for the bowel movements, we've tried every RX and OTC out there, and most days, I'm taking 3-10 laxatives.\u00a0\u00a0You'd think that alone would help me lose weight, that there'd be nothing left in me.\u00a0\u00a0Like I said.... at a complete loss.",

If I went once/week I was doing good and that was really hard to accomplish.\u00a0\u00a0Since constipation is a prime symptom of hypothyroidism, my constipation eased quite a bit when I was diagnosed hypo.\u00a0\u00a0I currently take both probiotics and digestive enzymes.\u00a0\u00a0It took a while, but they really do help to keep things moving.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, I'm having a hard time losing weight, too, though because of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.",
