            "answer": "Diabetes does not cause liver disease.Do you mean you were diagnosed with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease? NFLD. If you're obese, the doctor can help you to lose weigh through diet, exercise and, in some cases, medications and surgery. If a drug is causing your fatty liver disease, your doctor may try to switch you to a different medication.Your current doctor obviously knows little or nothing about cirrhosis of the liver and will do you more harm than good.

            "answer": "Thank you for your input, the dr I saw was a specialist, he was a gastroenterologist. I was more confused after my 2nd appointment. My family dr sent me to a lung specialist after I was having sharp pains in my right side after finding a bleb when he did a ct scan so I was sent to a lung specialist who prescribed prednisone tramadol and repeated the ct scan after 2 weeks,at that time the ct scan came back\u00a0\u00a0with cirrhosis and the lung specialist sent me to the gastroenterologist. I am going to see if I can make another appointment with a different gastroenterologist who can better explain all f this and come up with a Bette plan othe than cne back in 6 months and we will see how it is progressing.",

            "answer": "Since you know you have Cirrhosis, and you know you already have small esophageal varices, I think it would be best if you see a hepatologist.\u00a0\u00a0Gastroenterologists specialize in the entire digestive system, and hepatologists specialize in the liver.\u00a0\u00a0Although your current doc may be right and it may be just the beginning stage of Cirrhosis, the fact that you have esophageal varices concerns me and suggests that your Cirrhosis should be cared for by a hepatologist.\u00a0\u00a0As Hector mentioned, losing weight will greatly help your liver, if you are overweight.\u00a0\u00a0Although diabetes does not cause Cirrhosis, it can complicate your overall health care and the care of your liver, if it is not managed.\u00a0\u00a0Obesity leads to extra fat in the liver, which creates a burden on your liver.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes leads to circulatory problems and other issues which can complicate the care of your liver.\u00a0\u00a0Diet plays a very important role in weight loss, reducing the fat burden on your liver, and managing diabetes, but you need the advice of a very good hepatologist to know how best to do that.With your diabetes, you need to limit your carbs.\u00a0\u00a0With your esophageal varices, you need to limit sodium.\u00a0\u00a0With your fatty liver, you need to limit fats.\u00a0\u00a0It is a complicated balance, and only a hepatologist and a nutritionist at a liver transplant center can really guide that process.As far as prognosis goes, no one really knows how quickly or slowly Cirrhosis will progress.\u00a0\u00a0With the proper care and management of diet and medications, some people live with Cirrhosis for a long, long time.\u00a0\u00a0Without the proper care and management of diet and medications, some people get very ill very quickly, perhaps to the point of liver failure.There is no carved in granite timeline.\u00a0\u00a0If it were me, I would get to a hepatologist as soon as possible, and ask about nutrition and medications to help reduce the fat in your liver, if that is an issue, to stabilize your diabetes, to lose weight, if that is an issue, and to manage your varices or possible portal hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0There are many medications that are hard on the liver, and these must be avoided, so once you have a hepatologist, run all medications by him/her.Good luck to you, and keep us posted.Advocate1955",

            "answer": "Hi,Diabetes indirectly can cause cirrhosis.Diabetes causes nonalcoholic fatty liver disease which in turn leads to cirrhosis.There are many different causes of cirrhosis - NAFLD, alcohol intake, viral infections (B and C) etc.Cirrhosis is mostly irreversible though early cirrhosis due to alcohol has been found to reversible once you stop drinking alcohol.The only definitive treatment for cirrhosis is liver transplantation.Cirrhosis can be compensated or decompensated. Cirrhosis is said to be dcompensated whn complications like fluid accuulation in the abdomen, jaundice, encephalopathy (involvement of brain) occurs. Complications like GI bleeding and renal failure can occur.You have small varices only and no other complications. You may need medications to decrease the pressure in the blood system of the liver and a regular follow up endoscopy to see the status of the varices.Since you have a damaged liver, infection with hepatitis viruses can further damage it and make it decompensated.\u00a0\u00a0Hence get vaccinated against hepatitis viruses.",

            "answer": "Good advice from everyone. Cirrhosis is not a death sentence, but it does progress through the 4 stages. How quickly it progresses depends on many factors.I would focus on getting a doctor who talks more to you about the various stages. Varices is an indication that you are having portal vein hypertension. This is treated with a beta blocker to reduce the pressure.Diet and exercise are both important in halting the damage to your liver. The American Liver Foundation http://www.***********/groups/american-liver-foundation/ has people who are have cirrhosis from many different causes. Maybe you can get some help there.All my best to you! Take care of yourself!xo Karen:)",

            "answer": "Thank you to all for your input and concern, I did see a hepatologist and we discussed serious changes to my diet. He explained everything and I feel a lot better than I Previously did (atleast mentally.)\u00a0\u00a0I have been feeling tired lately and not sure if it is related to cirrhosis or just nerves, also have been a little nauseous. This dr has a little better game plan, will be going once a month for labs and every 6 months for ct scan.\u00a0\u00a0Is there anyone else thatHas the same symptoms and have lost weight and have had favorable results?

I asked him what the long term prognosis is and he said some people live years others don't.\u00a0\u00a0Is non alcoholic cirrhosis, cirrhosis caused by hepatitis is it all the same? Does anyone have this type of cirrhosis and can give me some insight?
