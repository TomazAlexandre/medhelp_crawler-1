            "answer": "From what I have read, most women who develop gestational diabetes do not need meds for the rest of their lives. Once the hormones stabilize again, most of the time the diabetes goes away (there are hormones in high levels during pregnancy that act to block the action of your insulin). However, your weight gain does seem like the real problem. Fat cells are insulin-resistant, type 2 diabetes can be the result, as you are experiencing. No one can tell you if you will have to take the medications after you lose the weight, but many people do find that their sugar levels go back to normal if they can slim down. We wish you the best in your efforts to lose the weight. We women do have to deal with this after having babies, and for some women it is harder than for others. I encourage you to join a gym, start walking everywhere you go, with babe in stroller, and do all you can to lose those pounds. Both you and your little one deserve this!",
