            "answer": "First up I'm not a doctor. Do you think you might have had a bad tummy virus? I know June seems like a long time ago but some things can linger a while. You say you are fatigued but you are still training? Is that right?\u00a0\u00a0Fatigue is often lifestyle related (alchohol, poor sleeping etc.)The other thing that comes to my head is a food intolerance. These can develop over time even in adults. The most common would be dairy and maybe wheat.Another option is anxiety. Are you sleeping well when you do sleep or do you wake early? Is your apetite normal or reduced? Do you have any involuntary movements ie touching face, pacing, jiggling? You are asking on a cancer board so do you think you have cancer? Does your doctor?I'm sorry you are dealing with this. Keep seeing your doctor. It looks like they are investigating you very thoroughly and I just wanted to say that I was thinking of you. Take care.",

            "answer": "Have you undergone an MRI or a PET scan?Like CT scans, they are tomographic exams that provide valuable diagnostic imagery. The CT scan creates a computed image; the MRI creates a magnetic field in order to render an image; and the PET scan utilizes radioactive substances (called tracers) to locate diseases within the body.Ordinarily, when one form of testing is inconclusive, another testing approach is tried.So, it's possible that what the CT scan doesn't reveal, the MRI or the PET scan will detect. Mention to your doctor(s) about the possibility of having other diagnostic imaging exams... because it sounds like you've through a lot of testing with no answer to your ailment. The MRI and the PET are more costly to perform... but, a lot of times, they're able to show what other tests don't.",
