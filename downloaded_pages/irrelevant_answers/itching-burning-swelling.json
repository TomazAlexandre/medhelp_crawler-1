            "answer": "Hi and welcome.Well the itching and burning I get and I was told it was due to nerves in my CNS going a bit silly.Peripheral Neuropathy A symptom most commonly associated with Diabetes, this can also be caused by Lupus. Peripheral nerves are the nerves located in your face, arms, legs and torso. When these nerves do not communicate properly with the spinal cord it is called peripheral neuropathy.This can cause pain, numbness, tingling, burning or itching. peripheral neuropathy is a result of damage to the axons or the myelin surrounding the nerves. It can be a result of diabetes or a side effect of certain medications, but is not caused by multiple sclerosis (MS).However, sensory symptoms of MS (such as parasthesias) that are caused by lesions in the central nervous system can closely resemble peripheral neuropathy. I have not been diagnosed with MS or LUPUS (ALTHOUGH I had one positive Lupus test), I doget this burning and itching and at the moment have it in my left hand. I get itmore when I am tired or hot. Yes I could scratch it raw.Can you not see your GP and ask for something to help you cope with this? Its very annoying and does take it out on you. Are you being investigated then for MS? This itching could belong to either disease which is bizarre in itself.But please see your GP there is stuff out there to calm this down for you. Big hugsMariaxxx",

            "answer": "Hi Sandie,I do not have Lupus. From what I know about Lupus it can cause a miriad of weird symptoms.I know that skin issues and swelling are extremely common.\u00a0\u00a0It could be affecting your nervous system.That would explain the burning and itching. But SLE causes imflamation in general so it could just be caused by that too.You should ask you Rheumatologist if there is somthing you can take for those symptoms.I burn and itch too.Mainly my face,back and neck. It can be miserable sometimes....I sort of know how you feel.....Please take Care, Theresa",

    "question": "Hi Everyone,I have posted here before, and I've been back and for between this forum and the MS forum.Anyway,\u00a0\u00a0I do have Lupus, and it's supposed to be in remission right now.\u00a0\u00a0I do know that even in remission, you will still feel the affects of the disease.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway,\u00a0\u00a0when it's active, I sometimes get this horrible itchyness, and burning on different parts of my body, mainly my shins, and my hands really bad.My hands get it the worst.\u00a0\u00a0They burn and itch and swell.\u00a0\u00a0I get these rashes from all the scratching and rubbing, otherwise I probably would'nt have a rash.\u00a0\u00a0My joints will hurt real bad too.\u00a0\u00a0The burning isn't coming from the rash, I start itching, and burning and then I think the rubbing and scratching make it all worse and that's what I think causes the rash.\u00a0\u00a0The itching seems more internal.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be from the Lupus.\u00a0\u00a0I have systemic Lupus, not the Discoid.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone else with Lupus get this?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks\u00a0\u00a0Sandie",
