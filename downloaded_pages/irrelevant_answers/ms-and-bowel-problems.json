            "answer": "Hi!The symptoms are unlikely to be due to MS. The incomplete evacuation of the bowel can be due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc. It can also be due to milk allergy and other food allergies. Diet poor in roughage and water too causes this, but you appear to be taking care of that. Do discuss these possibilities with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "For over 10 years I have had a sluggish bowel.\u00a0\u00a0It used to take me 15 minutes to go to the bathroom.Then 4 years ago, after the birth of my child, it now takes me 20-30 minutes to go to the bathroom.My main problem and question is that, my left side (my large intestine) never fully evacuates.\u00a0\u00a0Even when I went in for a sigmoidoscopy that area of my bowel would NOT fully empty.\u00a0\u00a0Not even during the pre-sigmoidoscopy prep.\u00a0\u00a0The liquid they had me drink prior didn't get it all out, neither did the hospital grade enema.\u00a0\u00a0During the sigmoidoscopy the doctor literally 'vacuumed' that area out.But during the sigmoidoscopy, the doctor said that the muscle in that area of the bowel was working fine, and chalked up that area not working well do a very minor rectocele that I have.Years later, another doctor has told me that perhaps that part of the bowel not emptying could be some kind of minor paralysis in that part of the bowel.(I am in my early 30s.\u00a0\u00a0I eat an all natural, fiber rich diet with lots of fruit and vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0On no medications.\u00a0\u00a0Possible MS/ Lyme Disease.)So, My Questions Are:\u00a0\u00a0The answer to #2 is the most important to me1) Could a portion of a bowel not work and be do to MS?*2) And if it is due to MS, could the muscle appear **normal** in that area on a sigmoidoscopy?Thanks so much",
