            "answer": "A nuclear stress test is usually done by getting your heart rate up to a desired level by treadmill exercise, then having a scan done by an MRI type machine specifically designed for that purpose.\u00a0\u00a0If you are unable to do the treadmill, then they will probably inject you with a drug that will cause your heart to temporarily speed up.\u00a0\u00a0It can be a little uncomfortable when the scan is being done because you will be required to lie still for 30-40 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0 It is a painless procedure, however.No doubt, given your age in particular, the doctors don't want any surprises when you are going to have a hip replaced.\u00a0\u00a0 Please regard the caution your doctors fare exercising about your treatment as a good thing.",

    "question": "I am 75 and Type 2 diabetes, under control. I have no cardiac symptoms. My electrocardiogram and Echo (sono) were fine. I have no heart pains. I am having a hip replacement. I will have a epidural and some pills for anesthesia. I am not required by the hospital to have cardiac clearance. Some rheumatologist at the hospital recommended I have a nuclear stress test before the surgery. I asked her why. She said my age, my diabetes and something else. Maybe family history. My father and his brother had heart trouble at a young age. I went to a cardiologist and he thought it was a good idea. I really do not want to have this test. Do I need it? I know it is precautionary but is it really necessary? I have so much pain and my other hip hurts so I may need to have that hip done down the line. It seems the immediate issue is my hip. I do not want to stir up troubles and wonder if this test is just drumming up more business for the doctor.",
