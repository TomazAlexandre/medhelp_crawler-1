            "answer": "I had too much fluid with my second and third, both were perfectly fine. But it is generally caused by gestational diabetes. I wasn't GD with either of them, so we didn't have a reason behind it. With my 2nd, it enabled him to tie a knot in his cord before delivery, with my 3rd it just caused a very long labor in the beginning as he woulnd't drop enough to put pressure on the cervix.Keep an eye on it, you should be able to find out more as your pregnancy progresses.",

            "answer": "I had way too much fluid, at 37 weeks I was measuring 46! Although I hadn't had GD by the 37 week my sugar levels were borderline, chromosomal testing (amnio) never revealed anything either. Lots of cases there is no explaination, it just happens. I was in alot of discomfort and had severe swelling of my whole body. An amnio at 37 weeks showed baby's lungs to be mature so he was delivered by c sect, my midwife joked they should have worn wellies in the OR there was that much fluid when they made the incision!! He was a healthy 8lb 10oz. He is 4 months today and is happy and a healthy 15lb, 62cm bouncibg baby.",
