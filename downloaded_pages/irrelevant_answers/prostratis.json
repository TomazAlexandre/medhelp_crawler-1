            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency, neurological causes or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels also evaluated. If the symptoms persist then get the above mentioned possibilities ruled out from a neurologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without knowing the relevant clinical details or a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include systemic infections, inflammations, metabolic issues, hormonal/ endocrine causes, micronutrient deficiencies, electrolyte abnormalities, hematological issues, anemia, growths/ masses etc. While fatigue and malaise could be causes due to prostatitis, the neuropathy is unlikely to be related. The symptoms may or may not completely be related to urological causes. I would suggest getting this evaluated in detail by an internist initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
