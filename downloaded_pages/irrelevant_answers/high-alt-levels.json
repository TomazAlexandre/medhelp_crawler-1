            "answer": "Hi there,Most of us in here are doing or have done the therapy your father is now doing; the drugs are interferon and ribavirin.His alcohol use might be increasing his liver enzymes along with the Hep C.Alcohol is very detrimental to HCV patients; it contributes to liver damage. Your father needs to deal with his alcoholism somehow; has he contacted Alcoholics Anonymous or another support group?The white cell booster is likely \u2018Neupogen\u2019. Interferon depletes white blood cells, reducing a patient\u2019s ability to fight off infection. The option is dose reduction of interferon, or cessation of his treatment program; the Neupogen works quickly, and will greatly reduce his chances of getting sick.If he likes, your father can join the forum here; it sounds like he could benefit from talking with others in the same situation.Good luck to you both,Bill",

            "answer": "Sorry honey we are not doctors but only patients of hepC.Yes alcohol is harmful for anyone with hepC and elevated alt levels. When a liver cell dies it releases a liver enzyme. So the higher the numbers the more cell death that is going on.\u00a0\u00a0Someone with hepc has liver damage that occurs just from the virus causing the fibrosis however adding alcohol on top of that is another thing for it to have to fight ........... so logically it would cause more damage exponentially.You said he treated the hepc not he is treating it. I'm assuming it didn't work? Oftentimes on treatment people do need to take injections to help with the blood - both white and red.I hope that somehow your dad finds help for his alcoholism - at least while he is hepC positive he should not be drinking. If he was to be cured and if he did not have a lot of liver damage then he could drink afterwards but it sounds like he probably has a significant amount of damage already.didn't they do a liver biopsy on him to see how much damage is already done?Good luck, I'm sorry that we aren't doctors but we have all had hep. Maybe someday you can get your dad to come talk to us..........there are an awful lot of really great guys around here and most of us have been right in the shoes your dad is in.",
