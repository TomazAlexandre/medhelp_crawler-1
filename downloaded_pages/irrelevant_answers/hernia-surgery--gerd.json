            "answer": "Hi there!Repair of groin hernia are usually successful and open surgeries have a higher success rate than laparoscopic surgeries. The hernia/ diabetes are unlikely to be responsible for the nausea. While GERD could cause nausea, nausea itself is a very non-specific symptom and could result from GI infection/ inflammation, micronutrient deficiencies, GI motility issues, o non-GI causes such as stress/ anxiety, hormonal/ endocrine imbalances, metabolic issues, micronutrient deficiencies, medication side effect etc. I would suggest getting this evaluated by an internist initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this helps.Take care!",
