            "answer": "Welcome to the forum.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your question.For the moment, I will assume your self-diagnosis of recurrent vaginal thrush (yeast infections) is correct.\u00a0\u00a0However, it seem you are uncertain about whether your current symptoms in fact are due to yeast.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, I strongly recommend you be professionally examined.\u00a0\u00a0Recurrent yeast infections usually can be easily prevented with a single oral dose of fluconazole (trade name Diflucan in the US) once a week.\u00a0\u00a0I will also add that fluctuating sugar intake will not trigger yeast infections, expect perhaps in people with poorly controlled diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0(Is there any chance you have diabetes?)Having said all that, I doubt you have genital herpes, which usually does not first show up as a single lesion.\u00a0\u00a0That said, the only way to know for sure is to be professionally evaluated.Finally, I doubt any of your symptoms have anything to do with the change in the soap used by you or your husband.Please let me know the outcome after you have been professionally evaluated; perhaps I'll have more comments at that time. In the meantime, don't be overly worried.\u00a0\u00a0I doubt you have herpes or anything else at all serious.Best wishes--\u00a0\u00a0HHH, MD",

    "question": "I am very prone to yeast infections and I had a lot of sugar over the past week. It looks like all the skin around the vagina is covered in thin white film making me think thrush?\u00a0\u00a0However I also noticed on the labia what kind of looks like a flat blister with a very mall white on it. At first I thought ingrown hair but, now I am worried. My skin s also very sensitive and I found out my husband switched the soap from Dove to something with a perfume. I have been married 11 years and had only that partner in my life. Any thoughts?",
