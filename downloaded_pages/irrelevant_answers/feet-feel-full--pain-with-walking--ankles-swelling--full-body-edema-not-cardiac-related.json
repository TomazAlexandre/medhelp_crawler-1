            "answer": "Dear Terry,This is a shot in the dark, but has your mother ever been testes for what they call \"Shadow Diabetes?\"\u00a0\u00a0There is another type of diabetes called LADA (Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults) that will put on sudden edema for \"no reason.\"\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest your mother see an endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0This type of doctor handles hormones, and glands, and all sorts fo things that can cause this sudden onset of fluid retention.\u00a0\u00a0I also would have her common bile duct checked.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes after a gall bladder surgery, before they get the entire thing out some stone \"sneak\" into the common bile duct an it's easy to diagnose and also correctable.\u00a0\u00a0I have many added problems that my doctors think are contributing factors to my problems.\u00a0\u00a0One is the amount of pain meds required due to RSD, Arachnoiditis and Cauda Equina besides 7 back surgeries, and more.\u00a0\u00a0But I would get her with a good endocrinologist and ask this person to see if she is retaining urine in her bladder (does she have urinary tract infections often?\u00a0\u00a0That's a dead give away.\u00a0\u00a0Please keep me posted.Lil Plum (Cathy",

    "question": "In 2005 while on vacation, I was fine for the first 3 days.\u00a0\u00a0When I woke up on the 4th day I couldn't get my rings off.\u00a0\u00a0I couldn't stand on my feet.\u00a0\u00a0My ankles were so swollen as were my feet.\u00a0\u00a0My hands looked like someone stuck a needle in them and blew them UP!\u00a0\u00a0I put 15lbs of fluid on in 48 hours. I'm a very thin woman.\u00a0\u00a0I was 57 when this happened. Although my medical history reads like fiction, it's all true.\u00a0\u00a0Fortunately, everything I've had was backed up with lab results, xrays, scans etc.\u00a0\u00a0However, I would give anything in the world to not have any of the things I do, the fact that they are \"visible\" to treating physicians makes it much easier for me!\u00a0\u00a0I've had 7 back surgeries and I'm fused from L3 to S1.\u00a0\u00a0L2 had a laminectomy, I had an 11mm kidney stone that was removed with Lithotripsy.\u00a0\u00a0I have severe full body edema now. No one can figure out why. I have had 2 very detailed cardiac workups and although I have mitral valve regurgitation, and P.A.T., there isn't any congestive heart failure or any other reason for this fluid retention.\u00a0\u00a0I wasn't bit by anything on vacation to cause this edema.\u00a0\u00a0And since it's 2008 now, if something like that had happened it surely would have gone away by now.\u00a0\u00a0When I had this onset of edema, I had a rash on both legs that also just appeared that morning.\u00a0\u00a0They were from the knees down on both legs. It was a brownish/reddish rash but only lasted 2 days.\u00a0\u00a0Then it disappeared. However, this fluid retention hasn't disappeared.\u00a0\u00a0In fact it's gotten worse.\u00a0\u00a0My primary care doctor sent me first to the cardiologist, and that dr. sent me to a nephrologist. That doctor said I had Lupus.\u00a0\u00a0He said the double stranded DNA test came back at 169 and the normal high was 39.\u00a0\u00a0But my primary care doctor ran further more extensive tests and they all came back as normal. However, I was sent to a rheumatologist just in case.\u00a0\u00a0I sat in that dr.'s office for 2 hours waiting to be seen. I asked the receptionist if the dr. had an emergency. She said that it was always like this.\u00a0\u00a0I said \"I've had numerous back surgeries and I can't sit 2 hours and wait for anyone!\"\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, while waiting, I noticed a gallary of pictures on this dr.'s wall.\u00a0\u00a0They looked like graduation pictures. Something like what a family would have hanging in their house.\u00a0\u00a0I looked closely at them and it had their names, dates of birth, and the day they SUCCUMED to LUPUS!!!\u00a0\u00a0I made my husband look at them\u00a0\u00a0because I couldn't believe this doctor was actually hanging pictures of his patients that had died due to the very disease they were seeing him for!!!\u00a0\u00a0It was then I decided I wouldn't be seeing him.\u00a0\u00a0However, right then I was called back.\u00a0\u00a0When he came in he was baffled as to why I didn't look the way my medical history read!\u00a0\u00a0I found myself defending the fact that I tried to not let me look on the outside how I felt on the inside.\u00a0\u00a0We obviously didn't get along.\u00a0\u00a0 I also was seeing a Pain Specialist who had diagnosed me with RSD.\u00a0\u00a0I also have Arachnoiditis that was diagnosed my MRI.\u00a0\u00a0I also had an EMG and was found to have severe carpal tunnel in my right wrist and De Quervains syndrome in my left hand/wrist.\u00a0\u00a0I had surgery for this de quervains syndrome and because of how painful that was, there is no way I'm having another surgery on my wrist!!\u00a0\u00a0When I wake in the morning is the worst time of the day.\u00a0\u00a0My feet are burning, swelling, and just to stand on them causes such pain.\u00a0\u00a0My hands always tingle....feel like they are \"waking up\" but it's very painful.\u00a0\u00a0I can't wear any of my rings anymore due to this edema.\u00a0\u00a0I've always been very thin, and even now, no one can believe me when I say what I weigh.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor keeps telling me not to worry about what the scale says since it's all water.\u00a0\u00a0That doesn't matter to me.\u00a0\u00a0I DO care what the scale says, I DO care as to why I'm in so much pain, and I want this fluid to go away!!\u00a0\u00a0I'm on Lasix everyday.\u00a0\u00a0I had been on Bumex, 3\u00a0\u00a0in the morning....and all the fluid went away...for one week.\u00a0\u00a0Then it all came back and then some.\u00a0\u00a0I've been tested for cortisol levels, diabetes, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Everything comes back normal.\u00a0\u00a0It's driving me crazy.\u00a0\u00a0Now they found a 7mm \"lesion\" in the middle of my liver and I will be retested in 10 weeks regarding that.\u00a0\u00a0Also my common bile duct is dilated and I'm supposed to have an ERCP to find out why.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor knows something is wrong but not one doctor can figure this out. I had my gall bladder out because it wasn't functioning and ended up with a septic infection from the surgery!\u00a0\u00a0At times I just want to give it all up.\u00a0\u00a0But then I see how much my family loves and needs me and would crumble if anything happened to me.\u00a0\u00a0Living with pain that is so severe that being on high doses of Dilaudid daily barely helps isn't how I wanted to live my life.\u00a0\u00a0Do you know if the RSD could be why I have this edema?\u00a0\u00a0I know it can cause fluid retention, but the pain in my feet and the swelling in my toes ankles, and basically my legs is just more than I can bare!!\u00a0\u00a0I need someone to help me and everyone I've seen just scratches their heads saying that they can see the edema, all you need to do is push your finger into my ankles and the indentation remains....they run test after test and except for the fact my organs seem DEHYDRATED, they have no answer as to why my vascular system is leaking into my tissues.\u00a0\u00a0Is there any possible thing you have to add to this strange disease that I could take to my doctor and ask him to check it out?\u00a0\u00a0I honestly, REALLY need some help.\u00a0\u00a0I do have a question though. I've only had the regular fasting glucose run on me.\u00a0\u00a0I've wondered if they should do the type of glucose testing that they do with pregnant women.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed years ago with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) however after having peritonitis, they did a total hysterectomy on me including the removal of my ovaries.\u00a0\u00a0I thought that once all those organs were gone the PCOS would be gone.\u00a0\u00a0But after talking to PCOS specialist they say that since it's a Pituitary/Adrenal gland problem, that I could still have problems with it.\u00a0\u00a0That's why I wondered if I should have this more detailed glucuse test run.\u00a0\u00a0I have a niece with Juvenile diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My grandfather on my father's side had diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother on my mother's side had Hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0We have diabetes throughout our family and when I read up on it, I see myself in their literature at times......especially this burning, tingling, swelling, ankle feet problem.\u00a0\u00a0I wear TED stockings all the time to try to help the swelling and pain in my legs from the knees down.\u00a0\u00a0There has to be a reason for this.\u00a0\u00a0And I'm sure it's right in front of our noses but I think it's such an obvious thing that no one is paying attention to it!\u00a0\u00a0PLEASE, PLEASE replySincerely,Lil plum",
