            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Blurring of vision and shortness of breath can be due to weakness, anemia and nutritional deficiencies due to chronic diarrhea. Chronic diarrhea can be due to parasitic infestations such as threadworm, round worm, tape worm, amoebiasis, or giardiasis.Other causes are irritable bowel syndrome, coelic disease, crohn\u2019s disease, malabsorption syndromes, pancreatic diseases, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, HIV etc.It is something difficult to diagnose on net. Try and increase the fiber in your diet. Also take a lactobacillus preparation and yoghurt with your meals. If possible try and get a stool test done. If these tips do not help, you will need to explore how best to get medical help.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "I got your reply and wanted to thank you for the information.Today I started experiencing tingling in my scalp. It's the same type of sensation when a limb falls asleep (if that makes sense) and doesn't seem to be going away. I'm also experiencing a heaviness in my chest.I feel like I'm pretty young to be dealing with heart problems! (Only 23..)I did some research on hyperthyroidism.. would these go hand in hand with these new symptoms + the old ones?Thanks!-keaj",

            "answer": "Hi!Tingling in scalp could be due to compression of nerves, dandruff, eczema or allergy to soap and shampoo.It can also be due to hyperthyroidsm. Anxiety, migraine, Multiple Sclerosis, and diabetes are the other causes. Since you also have heaviness in the chest, these causes are to be eliminated.If there is a history of unprotected sex or of blood transfusion or use of street drugs then test for HIV too.Hope this helps. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Symptoms:*Diarrhea*Vomiting*Nausea*Chronic fatigue*Headaches*Shortness of breath*Blurry visionMy problems began in August of this year. It started off with headaches and fatigue that I couldn't shake but it quickly became those problems plus one more major one: diarrhea and vomiting. It's lasted weeks and weeks and isn't getting better. Most days I just prepare myself with a bottle of water and hope for the best but now I'm having shortness of breath with blurred vision in the mornings and late at night (I wear glasses and it happens whether I wear them or not). I'm not able to obtain medical insurance and have no way of seeing a doctor without going to the emergency room.Advice? If I were able to have some kind of an idea of what's going on I'd feel better about venturing out to find some assistance with all of this.Thanks in advance.",
