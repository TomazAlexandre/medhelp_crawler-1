            "answer": "I also have Type II diabetes (I take insulin) and have foot pain but mine is really limited to the left heal for the \"bruised\" feeling.\u00a0\u00a0The rest of the foot just aches.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I'll just have the heal pain and nothing else and then sometimes both my feet will hurt and the heal won't be so bad.\u00a0\u00a0I go to the chiropractor and she really helps with that pain.\u00a0\u00a0Something to do with the Scatic nerve - it runs from the hip down to the heal and if it gets \"wrapped\" around the heal it causes pain. However - it can also get \"pinched\" and cause general foot pain.\u00a0\u00a0You might want to look into it.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you research the doc and that they are certified and that you get a full exam and xray before an adjustment.\u00a0\u00a0If they don't do that - then I wouldn't go to them.Hope all is well....",

            "answer": "hi junie,my husband calls me \"ms. hotfoot\",at night or right around dawn my feet can scramble a damn egg, boil water, make pancakes!!! you name your meal and i can cook it right on my feet!\u00a0\u00a0LOLreally the pain is awful! even though i have the pain daily it seems to irritate me the dawn/day after i've been very active or if i haven't watched the placement of my feet through out the day, or if i wore a cute with a pair of shoes that look good but are murder to my feet. sorry, i can't do the clog, dr.shools, gym shoe thing everyday!(I AM A TRUE SHOE FREAK! I'M NOT GIVING THEM UP WITHOUT A FIGHT! NEVER!)okay, enough with my shoe fetish.i deal with burning, itching, sensitivity to the touch.sometime i have to soak them in a cold tub of water, wrap them in a cold towel, just quik!please cool them off now...i have no dx'd name for this pain, i was just told by my dr. that it comes with the territory of fms!so when i'm not able to stand or sit for a water cool down, i go straight to the peppermint lotion that works wonder for me.i hope this can help you, and that you got a good laugh out of my foolishness. LOLoh! and if your still cutting out patterns, you're doing real good in my book. tonight my daughter wanted to make a wedding dress for her bratz doll, after i cut a hole in my bed sheet i decided to just jokingly blame it on her and sit along side the bed to finish her masterpiece.moesqueen",

            "answer": "Thanks for the comments, glad to at least have some idea that it is related to Fibro.\u00a0\u00a0It's just that it hasn't come on so severly or stayed so long befor this in the daytime.\u00a0\u00a0Wondering if I stayed off my feet for a couple of days and soaked them too, would it heal itself ?\u00a0\u00a0Of course then there is twice as much to catch up on when you do get going again so\u00a0\u00a0you can't win.\u00a0\u00a0At least i am not down in bed as some with the Fibro seem to be.Has anyone seen a podiatrist and did it do any good ?\u00a0\u00a0I have to see one anyway because of the diabetes.Use to see a Chiro, for years bf surgery and some after for upper back but now am afraid to let one touch my lower back.\u00a0\u00a0I did let one stretch my back ( or he suggested to do it ) and that was a mistake.Thanks for the replies.Junie",

            "answer": "When I first started having symptoms (when I was 13 y.o.), I had a sharp, sudden pain in my left foot one day and was on crutches for about a year. One day, an anesthesiologist gave me an injection of Toradol in the bottom of my foot. It was almost miraculous. I moved from putting no pressure on my foot at all to walking with a cane in the matter of 2 weeks. I walked with the cane for about another 6 months. I don't have diabetes or anything else. Pretty much just fibro. Best wishes! I hope you foot feels better soon!",

I wake up with both feet feeling like the bottoms were beaten with baseball bat and it takes an hour each morning to be able to move.\u00a0\u00a0But my right heel (bottom) aches all the time (more if I've been walking on it and more if I'm off of it for more than 15 minutes).\u00a0\u00a0Ha ha.\u00a0\u00a0The bone in my heel feels like it is cracked.\u00a0\u00a0And I get shooting pains up my right ankle (on the outside).I was told FM is sometimes triggered by other things (like hep-c, lyme or other autoimmune issues).\u00a0\u00a0Maybe one of them is causing the pain as well (I have hep-c) which also causes great pain.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot help you, Junie.\u00a0\u00a0God, I wish I could.\u00a0\u00a0But you are not alone.

Then one day I woke up and couldn't walk. I already had Sarcoidosis (lung disease), and it was a related side effect of that (arthromyalgia). I lived on Voltaren for a while, which partly controlled it, and then went on low dose steroids, which completely controlled it. Now I'm coming off the steriods and going back on Voltaren.Hope this helps.",
