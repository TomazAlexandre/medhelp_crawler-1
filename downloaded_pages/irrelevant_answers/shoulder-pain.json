    "question": "I am a 61 year old male that is in fair health except for pain in my left shoulder. I have battled this problem for many years. I play golf and it is really working on my game now. Some days I cannot make a turn when I swing the club. My question is this. How dangerous is a cortisone shot? I cannot take the Advil's or Alvie's because I have had problems with pain in my stomach when I take them. They also raise my blood pressure. I have tried taking them with food, taking anti-acids with them and still same thing. I have had the light ran down to see and the doc told me never to take them again because he seen lesions. I take Lortab 7.5 and they help some but I can still feel the pain when I swing a club. Now the problem about why I ask about the shot. I had one 2 years ago and the next day I decided to test my blood sugar using a meter I bought and it showed 165 on a fast. That night I tested I was at 265 after a small meal. called the Doc and he said it would return to normal in a few days. Is this good for a person. My B/S never goes over 95 fasting and I keep it under 140( at the 2 hour mark) after eating about 50 carb\u00a0\u00a0meals if I walk. I walk when I play golf and really want to play forever. What you think about that shot ? I have tried all the exercises over the years and I do work out everyday.\u00a0\u00a0I just need that pain free swing. Tom",
