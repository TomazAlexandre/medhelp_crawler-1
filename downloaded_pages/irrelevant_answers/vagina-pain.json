            "answer": "Hi,How old are you?I understand that you are embarassed about this but a complete assessment by your physician is necessary.Please do not be ashamed.Your physician is a professional and he/she has been properly trained and certified to do these tests.During the course of his/her training\u00a0\u00a0your doctor has been exposed to several similar cases. So feel free to talk to your doctor. Openly communicate your concerns.This way,a good patient doctor relationship may develop which will be highly beneficial in managing your condition.Now, just a few questions:For how long have you experienced this?Is there any associated vaginal discharge?Have you had any history of unprotected sex?Have you been sexually active?Also, any underlying systemic disease like diabetes ?Are you taking any prolonged course of antibiotics?",

            "answer": "As a woman who has spent most of her life dealing with kidney disorder I do feel your pain. I know how uncomfortable it is to undress for a stranger, however, if the dr can not see the problem they can not treat it. Perhaps you can find a dr you are comfortable with try requesting to see a female. Do what you can with what you have before it is too late. There are several easy possibilities for your situation. You could have an urinary tract infection, a kidney stone, or a vaginal yeast infection. It could be something else altogether. You should have a doctor check you out so they can eliminate all possiblities and treat you. If it is a urinary problem or vaginal infection those are easily treated. You can buy cream at a store for less than $20 if you have a vaginal infection, and there are some home remedies for urinary problems. If it is a urinary problem and you do not get it treated it is possible to get a kidney infection and these can be deadly if untreated.Some basic advice I have is wear cotton bottoms, avoid sugar for a little while, drink lots of water, and don't add anything to your bath that is perfumed. Furthermore, I drink a lot of Lite (or light depending on brand) cranberry juice; cran is good for you and the Lite variety has the least sugar. Some natural stores have what some people call a \"renal tea\" which is a mix of different herbs that are good for the urinary tract. For some people with mild infections, or who detect infections very early on, cranberry pills can help. Corn silk tea is a native American remedy which you can find in capsule form now. Some people swear that Oil or Oregano cures all of their infections. This can be found in capsule of liquid form at any natural store or select grocery stores. All of the herbs I mentioned range from 5 to 16 dollars. The Oil or Oregano may be irritating to sensitive skin so you may want to talk to someone who really knows their herbs before you try this. I would talk to someone before I used the Oregano Oil since I heard it can irritate sensitive skin.I have one GREAT TRICK with juice that will prevent an infection if it is done when you first feel irritation (before the infection has set it). Throughout the day I drink only water and cranberry juice, watch the sugar intake, but the rest of my diet is normal. Shortly before bed I guzzle as much LITE cran juice as I can. I usually start 2 hours or 1.5 hours before I go to bed and guzzle about a cup RIGHT before bed. I usually end up drinking about 32 ounces or so within the 2 hours or 1.5 hours before bed (1 quart, or half a bottle). With a child you will want to use much less juice. The only downside is once i wake up I have to rush to the restroom but I end up feeling just fine.since your situation involves a cath I am not sure that flushing your system is what you need; I am not a dr, just someone who has had a lot of kidney pain.I truly hope your health is perfect.",

            "answer": "Hi,This sounds like a case of vaginitis.Vaginitis may be due to certain organisms.Some cases of vaginitis my be sexually transmitted such as the case of bacterial vaginosis.In your case,there is no significant sexual history. A primary differential will be vaginitis secondary to a yeast infection. This may be due to a\u00a0\u00a0candida infection which may be caused by hormonal imbalance or an underlying systemic disease (eg diabetes).Maintain good genital hygiene and discuss this with your physician.There are antifungal medications with vaginal suppository preparations that may work for you. Do not self medicate.Analysis of vaginal discharge will help determine the diagnosis.",
