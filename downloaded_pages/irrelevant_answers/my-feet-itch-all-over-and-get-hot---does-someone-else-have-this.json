I am sure the Dermatologists would have caught this but who knows. It may be a long shot but check out this website I just gave another person:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001835/",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Diabetes, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and malnutrition should be ruled out first. Itchy feet with tiny white blisters could be eczema, fungal infection, dermatitis, contact allergy with allergens like soap, chemicals etc.\u00a0\u00a0If you itch between toes too, there are chances that it is scabies, fungal infection and sweat dermatitis.Do discuss this with a skin specialist. Take care!",

    "question": "My feet started itching about a month ago. I would get up in the middle of the night with really hot itchy feet. After a week i noticed small red blisters on my feet only when i would scratch. The itch would only wake me up a couple of times in the middle of the night and i was better for a while but now my itch has come back with a vengeance since the weather got hotter. I now stay awake almost all night, every hour and keep immersing my feet every hour to control the itch. Have seen two dermatologists; one suggested dermatitis without paying much attention to my symptoms, which are feet getting itchy all over as they become hot. He prescribed me a cortisone cream which hasn't helped at all. The second one said it's a rare disease called erythromelalgia and that i just have to live with it and keep immersing my feet in water to cool them down. I finally called a dr. friend who's a neuro physician. He is ordering some blood work which will include sugar, thyroid, vitamin b12 and some other tests. He thinks its some sort of nerve dysfunction. My itchy feet are just driving me nuts!!!! Does anyone else have this problem and what was their diagnosis? Will the itch every go away. My problem is getting worse by each passing day.....i'm really desparate !!!!!",
