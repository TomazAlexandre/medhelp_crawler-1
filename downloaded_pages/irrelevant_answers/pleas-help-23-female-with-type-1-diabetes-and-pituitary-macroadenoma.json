    "question": "I have had juvenile diabetes for 12 years and have been experiencing fatigue ever since. It has gotten worse as I have gotten older. I am 23 now and I will sleep for over 24 hours about 2-3 times a month. I get sick very easy and struggle to keep my sugars in range. I was recently diagnosed with a macroadenoma on my pituitary gland. I weigh 120 and am 5 feet 2 inches tall, so not really out of the ordinary there. I do get nauseous at times and my weight can fluctuate easily from 114 - 133. I struggle to get up in the morning and I am tired all the time regardless of the amount of sleep I get. I'm not depressed so I don't know what it is. My labs were:TSH normalfT4 lowT4 lowT3 normalMCH highRBC lowNa slightly lowCl slightly lowA1C 7.0Cortisol normalProlactin lowGrowth Hormone normalACTH normalVitamin D slightly lowMicroalabumin 1.7 mg/dLPlease, this has gone on for too long with no real answers. I have been told that the tumor probably is not causing the symptoms. That was from the Shands too. I get hedaches and body aches all the time. Usually towards the end of the day. I have trouble concentrating when reading sometimes my eyes twitch when I focus on a book. Any comments would be greatly appreciated.",
