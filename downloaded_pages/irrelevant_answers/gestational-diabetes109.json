            "answer": "You will be fine hun. You may be able to control it with diet. The dietician will give you goals and ideas on how to change your diet. They may also give you a glucometer and show you how to properly use it. I have type 2 diabetes and as long as I am not pregnant I can control it with diet alone. If you have any questions you can email me on here. Also when I am pregnant I am insulin dependant but everyone is different",
