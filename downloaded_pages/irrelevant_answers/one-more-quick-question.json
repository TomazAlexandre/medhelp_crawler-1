And when I sleep I don't' go 8 hours without drinking..I wake up every 2 so damn thirsty...so I just tried to sip water throughout the night. But I woke up feeling so dehydrated and I didn't want that to happen so I didn't drink a lot, but just enough to keep me going. I go to get my blood done and they took 18 TUBES of blood from me! HOLY HELL, I thought I was going to pass out! Finally after 13 tubes my left arm gave out and they had to use my other arm! It was crazy!!! So glad thats over with!Thanks for the advice ladies!

    "question": "I'm having some testing tomorrow....I'm really anemic so my doctor is testing me for a bunch of things...hemaglobin, protein S, protein C, lupus etc. She said its all normal testing because she just wants to make sure all of that is normal since I've had 2 M/C's in a row. So I'm not worried at all but she did mention that I have to fast after midnight. Now I know that means no eating, but can I drink water? I get SOOO thirsty! At night and ALL throughout the night! I plan on going to get my blood tested very early in the am but still how am I going to last 7-8 hours without water?? Help!",
