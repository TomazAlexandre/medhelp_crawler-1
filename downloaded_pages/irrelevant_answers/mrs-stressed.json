Get your glycosylated hemoglobin checked to know if there is good control of sugar. Color dopplar of arteries supplying to the area where you develop scalp will give a god idea about blood supply to these regions. Your dermatologist will be able to help you too.Hope this helps.

    "question": "I've had non-healing sores with scabs, some of the same ones, for over a year!\u00a0\u00a0I'm a 59 year old diabetic with no history of skin problems. They start from a wound as small as a IV stick, or a razor nick. If I really scrape myself, the sore gets humungus. It forms a scab that will not come off for a few weeks. When it does, there's a deep crator in my leg, arm or scalp. Those are the only areas I develope them. I've seen my Primary Care doctor. She doesn't know why they start. When I was hospitalized, none of the doctors there knew either. I have an appointment with a dermatologist in a couple weeks. I'm hoping she'll know what's causing them. I'm wondering if this website can identify my condition.This discussion is related to/posts/show/765482.",
