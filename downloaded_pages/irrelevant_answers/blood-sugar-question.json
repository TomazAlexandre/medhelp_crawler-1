            "answer": "\" Are these levels normal?\"First, I'm glad you posted for the chance of diabetes are greater when the parents have it. What you need to do today is change doctors and find one that will listen to you, offer advice, and not ignore your health. Unfortunately not all doctors follow their \"hippocrates oath\" and it appears yours is in this category. Ask your doctor to test your glucose (blood sugar) with an OGTT (oral fasting glucose and an A1c test. What you're exhibiting is Hypoglycemia, low glucose levels where your body (pancreas & liver) are not producing the right amount of insulin. Dropping below 60 mg/dl leads to drowsy/fatigue conditions. Below 40 mg/dl is considered dangerous to the point of coma.Most OTC glucose meters need calibration to the test strip, some do not, and some are plain inaccurate. And then some meters require that you NOT squeeze your finger for the blood droplet. Carefully read and follow the meter instructions prior to use. All the necessary prevention and control methods are explained on this web sitehttp://www.diabetes.org/type-1-diabetes/tight-control.jspRead and understand before you see your doctor. It makes for a better understanding what he/she will explain and for your order of treatment.In the meantime, keep some hard candy or orange juice handy. If you start to feel tired/fatigued/drowsy chew on a candy or drink the juice to help bring your glucose levels back up. You can also buy OTC glucose tablets too.",

            "answer": "Hi April,if you are having hypoglycemic episodes then it is also important to look at what you eat..You will need to eat foods that digest slowly to give you a steady blood glucose level.\u00a0\u00a0Donuts are not good (I know you said this is not usual) because they digest very quickly releasing a lot of sugar, then your insulin levels will go way up and drive the sugar down.\u00a0\u00a0However, becuase the donuts are already digested there is not enough ready sugar available (and maybe your insulin response was very high) and then your blood sugars will be driven very low.Yes, you need some ready sugar / candy when you do have low blood sugar, but complex carbs at other meals to help keep things steady.\u00a0\u00a0Small snacks between meals may also help.",

    "question": "First off let me start by saying I have never been diagnosed as having diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0So I hope you dont mind me posting here.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 26yo female, not over weight or anything like that.\u00a0\u00a0I have a family history of diabetes on both my mom and dads side.\u00a0\u00a0I have been having episodes lately that my doctor has not really been much help with telling me what has been causing them.\u00a0\u00a0It started with spell of feeling lightheaded and kinda foggy and feeling as though I were going to pass out.\u00a0\u00a0Here recently I have had these spells with vision problems also associated with them.\u00a0\u00a0The two spells in which I had vision problems I realized also came at times before I have eaten.\u00a0\u00a0Once before breakfast and once before lunch.\u00a0\u00a0So I decided to buy a glucose monitor to check to see if maybe low blood sugar was the culprit.\u00a0\u00a0Well this morning before I bought it I came to work, had 2 donuts for breakfast (this isnt an everyday thing, someone just decided to be nice and bring some to work this morning) then I had 2 cups of coffee with creamer that contains sugar and on the way to work this morning I had a large cup of sweet tea.\u00a0\u00a0I checked my blood sugar around 11:45 and it was only 67.\u00a0\u00a0I ate lunch which consisted of a tuna sandwich with let. and tom. and had some cool ranch doritos and a 16 oz Lipton Extra Sweet Tea that contains 56g of sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Checked by sugar at 1:45 (2 hours after a meal) and it was still just 100.\u00a0\u00a0Are these levels normal?",
