            "answer": "Hi,Your fasting numbers are consistent with diabetes, and given the other numbers it is likely early diabetes. Your history of gestational diabetes put you at risk from early on. At this stage you should meet with a nutritionist to develop a diet plan(even if you are not overweight, changing your diet to a high fiber, higher protein, lower carbohydate diet may help) and starting an exercise routine should help bring all of your blood sugars into the normal range.\u00a0\u00a0 Give it your best shot during the next 3-6 months and keep checking your blood sugars regularly.Take care.",

    "question": "I have been told I have prediabetes and have been monitoring my blood sugar at home. My fasting sugars are usually around 120 to 124...but I have had a fewl that were above 130 though. It was my understanding that two consecutive fasting blood sugars above 126 meant a diagnosis of diabetes. Is that true? My blood sugars during the day are not too bad...right around 140 two hours after a meal, but I have had a couple of high readings of over 180 after meals...So, do I have diabetes or is it still considered prediabetes? I would like to add that I am a 51 year old female, I am not overweight, but I did have gestational diabetes with my third pregnancy when I was 27.",
