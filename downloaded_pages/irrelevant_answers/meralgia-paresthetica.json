            "answer": "1. It's actually more typical for meralgia paresthetica to be numb and mildly uncomfortable rather than burning, horrific pain. The location of your symptoms is typical of the disease, but keep in mind I have not examined you personally.2.Sounds like you've had an extensive workup looking at all the major things that can cause those symptoms. An MRI done with gadolinium (dye) would be important for looking at the spine and brain to evaluate you for demyelinating diseases, but if that was done you should be ok. Depending on the physical exam findings, if we are concerned about a possible rare or inflammatory disease, we sometimes check a spinal tap.3. It would be very unusual for optic neuritis to present with mild visual changes. Your doc is right that it's often quite painful and there is a marked change in vision during a flareup. But there are some patients who swear they never had any significant problems and we see scarring or evidence of prior optic neuritis on a thorough eye exam using a funduscope. Consider seeing an ophthalmologist (not an optometrist)for a formal exam. Best of luck.",

    "question": "I was recently dx w/ Meralgia Paresthetica after several years of severe numbness of the outer side of my right thigh.And mild numbness on my left thigh.Most sites define MP as a PAINFUL condition.Is it unusual to have such severe numbness w/out having pain?My upper legs feel \"tight\" sometimes but never really hurts.I am concerned about more serious conditions such as MS.Have had MRIs of brain and c-spine both w/ contrast looking for MS.Both normal.Also have had ct scan of spine,blood work (diabetes,lyme,liver,thyroid), and an EMG.All normal.Also have had mild numbness of face and hand weakness.Both are mild and dont seem to last very long.Could any other condition cause such symptoms?Also, is optic Neuritis always obvious.Can mild vision disturbances and eye strain be a form of mild Optic Nueritis.My PCP says most cases of Optic Nueritis are quit severe in\u00a0\u00a0symptoms and come on suddenly.Is this correct? o' by the way. I am a 32 year old male, app 35 pounds overweight....thank you for any advice.",
