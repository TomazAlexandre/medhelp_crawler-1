            "answer": "Hi.You are correct in saying that you have a risk of stroke. And this is not only due to the family history. The hypoplasia of your left vertral artery puts you in a risk for stroke in the posterior circulation area. We have a few good references for this. You must get regular scans (MRAs) of the blood vessels.In your case, it will help to know if your posterior communicating arteries exist and working. If they are absent, there is an increased risk.Also, if you mean surgery, when you say more aggressive treament, it is not advised.But do follow a proper drug regimen.All the best.DrAbhijeetMD",
