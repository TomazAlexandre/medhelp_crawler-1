            "answer": "Thanks.I have regularly been checked for thyroid and diabetes. I do take medication for bipolar disorder and manic depression. Neither of these drugs are supposed to cause weight gain either. Phentermine is a stimulant/appetite suppressant. I am going to try liposage slim wrap this week and see if that helps.",

    "question": "I started taking Phentermine 30 mg daily on Feb 4, 2009. To date I have not lost a pound. Infact I gained a 2 lbs. I have increased my exercise on my Elliptical (30-60min/day) and started to eat healthier. How long does it take for phentermine to kick in? Any advice? Anything I should say to my physcian?",
