            "answer": "I was seldom bothered by acid reflux or \"heart burn\" until I went in for an angioplasty which resulted in a heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0On leaving the hospital, I was given a prescription for Prilosec for acid reflux among my other prescriptions.\u00a0\u00a0This seemed strange that I would be given this med automatically, without my having complained about anything.\u00a0\u00a0But when I didn't take it, I suffered something awful.Months later, I was diagnosed with diabetes and I began following the recommended practice of small portions of food throughout the day rather than 3 large meals.\u00a0\u00a0One of the men in the diabetes education course with me stated that he had stopped taking his acid reflux med.\u00a0\u00a0Since then, I have not taken a single Prilosec pill!I can't make the connection between my heart problems and the doctors putting me on acid reflux med.\u00a0\u00a0When I complained about chest pain, the doctor suggested I take the Prilosec.\u00a0\u00a0(My problem was angina not indigestion and Prilosec had no effect on my chest pains.\u00a0\u00a0I carry nitroglycerin for that.)Maybe you can experiment with something like eating smaller meals to see if that has any benefit.\u00a0\u00a0Are you taking any other meds such as for high blood pressure or cholesterol?\u00a0\u00a0It's possible the meds are causing excess acid to be produced/released.I have no knowledge about ceragem therapy.",
