            "answer": "I was also on metformin. I started 1 pill daily then worked my way up the 3 pills daily. I continued on it until I achieved a pregnancy. Once I became pregnant I was followed by a endo during the pregnancy to follow my sugar levels. I ended up going on insulin. I needed the metformin in the beginning for the same reason you did. It did work for me. Hang in there!!!!",

    "question": "so i get a phone call from the nurse today to give me results on my blood work... (a little backgroud: they think i'm pcos, i've been on clomid for 2 cycles at 150mg, and i rarely ever get my period with out it being induced).... so she basically said that i have eggs but they are too small (anyone know what causes eggs to be small????)... i'm on cd21 and they are like 10mm, therefore don't even try bd'ing cuz it's not gonna happen so i have to go in for a hcg shot tomorrow to bring on my period.\u00a0\u00a0I used provera for the last two months, it worked but they said instead of waiting out my cycle, taking provera for 10 days and then getting af.... get a shot and it will be here in 14 days or so.\u00a0\u00a0Then she told me she saw high levels of insulin in my blood so they are sending it out to make sure i don't have diabetes... but that i will probably be put on metmorfin to reduce the amount of insulin in my system cause that could be a reason i'm not ovulating.\u00a0\u00a0Along with the metamorfin, we're going to do injectables to make my eggs grow.... Does any one know how long you have to be on the metmorfin for?..... Last but not least, she said i have low estrogen... now, doesn't that make you have hot flashes? cuz i've been getting them real bad but i thought it was effects of the clomid... also does low estrogen make you \"dry\"? cuz bd'ing last night wasn't as pleasant as it should have been....wow, ok i feel like i wrote a book. I just got bombarded with all this info today and i know the only ones who could understand and answer these questions are you guys!\u00a0\u00a0Thank God for this forum... at least reading everyone's experiences I dont' feel like i'm the only one and i've heard of all these terms and procedures! Thanks guys...just have to keep reminding ourselves that it will all be worth it in the end....",
