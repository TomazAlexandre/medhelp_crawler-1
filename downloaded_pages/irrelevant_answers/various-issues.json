            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The symptoms could be due to inflammatory bowel conditions such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease, Celiac disease (gluten intolerance), lactose intolerance or IBS or irritable bowel syndrome. Severe acidity with gastric reflux can also be a cause and so also hiatal hernia. Liver infection and gall stones too are a possibility. Take an OTC lactobacillus preparation and yoghurt with your meals. Drink plenty of fluids. Eat small light meals like a lightly buttered toast, yoghurt, porridge, cornflakes; take OTC antacids after meals and Omeprazole empty stomach in the morning and watch for 2-3 days. If symptoms do not subside consult your PCP. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Last Friday I started getting pains in my chest, however we were just in the process of being smacked with over a foot of snow, and I had to choose between calling an ambulance or staying put alone at home (which also would have meant leaving my cat alone until someone could come over). I stayed put, the pains got worse, and by Sunday morning I had pain that was impossible to ignore, even at rest, in the center of my chest. It was pressure, it was even crushing. So I finally called 911, an ambulance was sent and I was brought to a local hospital, where I was admitted and had several tests: chest xray, blood panels, stress tests, electrocardiogram, etc. By Monday evening I was released from the hospital. My heart checked out fine and the pains had stopped during the hospital stay. To paraphrase the attending physician, he still didn't know what caused the pains, but it certainly was not heart attacks/heart disease. It was something I should continue to pursue at my doctor's office, but it was very unlikely to be something life-threatening.So, I returned home, with car still plowed in my driveway, and blizzard number two arriving on Tuesday evening. On Wednesday, in the process of getting another two feet of snow here, I vomited violently, and by Thursday morning had had three violent bouts of diarrhea. During this time I had a fever of about 100.5 F. Again, I was faced with the choice of ambulance or staying home, and again I stayed home. And by Thursday morning, I felt much better.Now, this morning, even after putting myself on a very bland diet, I have the chest pains again, although I also have right side pain under the breast bone area. I also am nauseous, and had a difficult time sleeping last night.Other important info about me: I am 6'0\", 310 lbs., was diagnosed with diabetes about 12 years ago, I take insulin and oral diabetes meds,\u00a0\u00a0also take meds to help control cholesterol and blood pressure, though all of that seems to be well controlled now (other than my weight, that is).I am going to try to somehow get to my doctor's office now that the roads have been pretty much cleared, even though it will take quite an effort to dig my car out after being plowed in twice after two major snow storms (and should I even be trying that with unexplained chest pain?)\u00a0\u00a0so I'll have to find a ride (or someone who is willing to dig my car out of the snow) somehow.But, any ideas on what is going on with me?We're talking about chest pains that mimic the symptoms of a heart attack, but aren't heart-related; and nausea/vomiting/diarrhea which may or may not be related to the chest pains; and these symptoms are taking place even with a very bland diet.",
