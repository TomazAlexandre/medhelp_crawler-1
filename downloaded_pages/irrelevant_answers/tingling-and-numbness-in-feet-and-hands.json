            "answer": "Hi, I used to have all that tingling in my hands and feet, my feet ached when I tried to stand up affter a night's sleep.\u00a0\u00a0This was about 5 years ago, and I went to my doctor with it and he said I had fluid retention and needed to take pills to reduce that, after reading up on the side effects of prescribed tablets I realised they were worse for my body than the rentention itself!\u00a0\u00a0Well before I go any further I must tell you I am a Christian and I prayed to God about the ailments I was suffering with the tingling was just part of it, and my God delivered! It is my duty as a Christian to share the good news, I was told by my Lord and Saviour when pregnant with my last child to try the pregancy care suppliment which is a multi vitamin and mineral suppliment especially formulated for pregnant women and within 5 days of taking the one suppliment my aches in my feet stopped the tingling stopped and numerous other ailments began to improve over the course of time.\u00a0\u00a0I had a fabulous pregnancy no complications, (even though my doctor advised against the suppliments), my blood pressure was normal my blood sugar was normal my cholestrol was normal no problems to report, even the doctors were baffled as to how my pregnancy was going so smooth, as I was classed as an \"older mother\" and prone to diabetes because of family history! , To this day I take multi vitamins and mineral suppliments that have renewed my body and given me a new lease of life, furthermore I have not developed diabetes although last year my husband did and I encouraged him to start taking a multi vit and mineral suppliment, and ever since his regular check ups his blood sugar level as been normal this is almost a year on from when he was firs diagnosed, I have vowed to share this good news with as many people as I can as God through Jesus Christ as helped me tremendously, my quality of life is so improved, no more aches other than the ocassional tiredness, no tingling, no bad breath, or sore bleeding gums with aching teeth!\u00a0\u00a0My hair skin and nails have greatly improved year on year and I'm suppose to be getting older!\u00a0\u00a0My friend share this with as many people as you possibly can, try multi vits with minerals, try also omega 3 oils, or cod liver oil the old favourite, ( if you feel particularly ill try doubling up on you multi vitamin in take until you begin to feel better and the reduce it back to one a day suppliment, God Bless You in you new found health and happines!",
