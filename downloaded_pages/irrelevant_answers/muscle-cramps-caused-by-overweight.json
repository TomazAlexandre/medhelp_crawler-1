            "answer": "My waist to hip ratio was a sky high 0.96 due to severe insulin resistance. If you want to gain weight around the abdomen you do so eating carbs! I was eating too much refined sugar (a naughty carb lol) in my low calorie diet. And when you are insulin resistant/diabetic you are losing excess magnesium through the urine. Magnesium deficiency causes muscle cramps.\u00a0\u00a0I reversed my severe insulin resistance by avoiding added sugar (I'm not a big carb eater otherwise) and I'm no longer losing excess magnesium either.From Diabetes UK - Low Carb High Fat Diet...\"What is the low carb, high fat diet?As the name suggests, the diet suggests eating high fat and low carbohydrate foods.The LCHF diet is different to such diets as the Atkins diet as there are no \u2018stages\u2019 to work through, so the diet can be followed indefinitely.Who is the diet for?The diet, because of its low requirement for insulin, has been recognised by the Swedish government as being suitable for people with type 2 diabetes and as helpful to individuals looking to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight.Which foods can I eat on the LCHF diet? \u2013 Green light foodsThe following foods are compliant with the diet:Dairy: natural yoghurt, cheese, cream, butterMeatFishEggsVegetablesOlive oil and canola oil (organically grown and cold-pressed)Home made saucesThe recommendation of the low carb, high fat diet is that people eat full fat versions of dairy food in preference to low fat options.The diet does not rule out fatty meats and instead encourages people to leave the fat on rather than removing it.Organic versions of foods are suggested where possible.What food can I have up to moderate amounts? \u2013 Amber light foodsThe following foods can be eaten in moderate amounts:Bean and lentilsNuts, almonds and sunflower seedsFruit (not including dried fruit)Chocolate with a high cocoa quantity (65 to 90%)Sausages can be eaten occasionally but can include undesirable additives.Alcohol can be included with the note that it is fattening and can lead to imbalances in blood sugar.What should be avoided on the diet? \u2013 Red light foodsThe diet suggests that only a minimal amount of the following should be eaten:Potato, rice, bread, flour and corn based productsOther cereal-based products \u2013 such as pasta, pastry, biscuits and breakfast cereals.Dried fruitSweets and cakesSugary drinksMargarinesOmega-6 based oils \u2013 such as corn, sunflower, safflower, soybean and peanut oil\"",

            "answer": "If your BMI is over 20, then you might be leptin resistant, something you could have before your knee injury, resulting in increased inflammationwith higher Tumor Necrosis Factor and affecting T4 conversion to T3and T3 resistance, even with \"normal\" Labs according to conventional serum thyroid tests.Decreased bone metabolism ( TNF\u00a0\u00a0lowers\u00a0\u00a0D3\u00a0\u00a0as well which is needed for calcium metabolism) is a likely causative factor in the knee fracture.Magnesium deficiency (as Red Star mentioned), leptin resistance with high circulating leptin, is common with diabetes sufferers.Usually leptin resistance precedes insulin resistance and may lead toother hormonal deficits in the long run because of increased cortisol at the expense of other hormones, which eventually results in adrenal fatigue, as it is unsustainable (high cortisol) over long time.A paleo diet with ample intake of healthy fats is recommended by most knowledgeable practitioners, but do not expect your doctor to endorse this,unless he's holistic and open minded.Sorry Red Star but I feel \"unfriendly\" toward canola oil (PUFA, GMO etc)Use organic virgin coconut oil for cooking as it does not alter chemically and will not contribute to inflammation when heated unlike all long chain fatty acid vegetable cooking oils!I had an entire discussion last Feb on this with a friend who's a Clinical Dietitian (studied with my wife)\u00a0\u00a0and she had no idea about all the controversy with this. There are other much healthier oils, but must be cold pressed, fresh, refrigerated and consumed cold away from hot mealsTry transdermal magnesium chloride (magnesium oil) treatments for the safest and most efficient ways to boost your Mg levels. It will serve you well in more ways than what you can ever imagine! One side benefit is that it will help increase bone and joint flexibility over time.Let me know if you need details.Niko",

            "answer": "Red Star, you don't miss a beat!Yes, you should try coconut oil.I've been buying large quantities of 5 Lt pails at wholesale prices, on a share/co-op basis for years and the majority of the people still buying itare fairly healthy-\u00a0\u00a0some who had some issues are significantly healthier!And if you don't do oil pulling (most oils work for this, but I find Coconut oilworks better), you're depriving yourself from one of top ways to expel toxins and bacteria BEFORE\u00a0\u00a0they enter your body!And your teeth and gums feel wonderful within just a couple weeks of oil pulling.Look up the coconut research center website.Dr. Bruce Fife there, is one of the most amazing researchers, I've come across. I have read many of his books- most of which are on coconut oil.Cheers!Niko",

            "answer": "Hehe. :)\u00a0\u00a0Speaking of toxins, I came across this article \"5 Scientifically Proven Health Benefits of Intermittent Fasting\" (I do intermittent fasting as my normal way of eating anyway; I fast 14 to 20 hours a day) which states this...\"4. INTERMITTENT FASTING INDUCES AUTOPHAGY IN THE BODYYou might wonder what the heck even is autophagy and why should you care?Well let me tell you:Autophagy is an extremely precise mechanism of action in your body which in a nutshell means that your body flushes out everything it doesn\u2019t need. This happens in the cellular level. So basically your cells remove all the toxins in them.So it\u2019s \u201cdetoxification\u201d on steroids.The good news are that according to this study, fasting has been shown to induce autophagy in the human body.NOTE: Autophagy is something that significantly increases your testosterone production, as it removes xeno-estrogens and endocrine disrupting chemicals from our cells.\"",
