    "question": "I was prescribed metformin today. Had a couple high numbers. This opened up my eyes to really try and keep my blood sugars leveled out evenly. Just needed that extra push to motivate me to keep them right.I was wondering if there was any mommies out there who went through gestational diabetes and was prescribed\u00a0\u00a0this medication and if it was good for you? Did it effect your baby? Or any advice you can give me. . . Very much appreciated.I am currently 33 weeks and 4 days",
