            "answer": "H! Do you think you might be suffering from panic attacks? I used to suffer terribley in my teens, and then I had an almighty one just after I had my SVT and been diagnosed with diabetes. I was scared the SVT would happen when I was out, and as a consequence on one trip I had an almighty panic attack where I felt as if I could not breath, my legs went very week, my chest felt awful and my fingers tingled, and I felt sick.Panic attacks can last for a long time and they do tend to build up and suddenly you are in it's grip.If you are worried maybe you should go back to your doctor just for peace of mind.I hope things work out for you.Best Wishes",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!There are two possibilities. One is that you have panic attacks. The other is that you have menopausal symptoms. Thyroid problems and abnormal levels of FSH, LH, prolactin, androgen hormones or male hormones and estrogen hormones too can be the cause and hence a complete hormone panel should be done. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor regarding these two possibilities.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thanks for your reply. I don't think it is panic attack as my heart beat is normal during the that period. I suspect it might be menopausal symptoms but then I am 70 years old now, my menopause started long long time ago, but the symptom just arise recently.",

    "question": "I\u2019m a 70 years old woman. I recently encounter a symptom that repeat roughly every 13 days. It started with me feeling my head very heavy and dizzy and my feet feel weak. After around 30 minutes, I started to feel my body become hot and I began to sweat. My chest will feel like stuffed. This will last for around 2 hours then I vomited. Sometimes this whole process will last for as long as 6 hours. During this process, my heart beat is quite normal, my breath is a little bit quick, I can hear and see normally. Sometimes before this whole process begin, I can feel it coming.I have done MRI on my brain, doctor said no problem. Done my brain wave scan, no problem. Done my stomach scan, blood test, full body check, doctors did not find any problem. I have also consulted a few Chinese traditional doctors, but their remedies fail to stop this.This periodical symptom is wearing me down. I\u2019m now very weak and thin. I hope I can find some answer here. Thanks a lot.",
