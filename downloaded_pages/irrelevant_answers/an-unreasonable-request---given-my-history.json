            "answer": "Sorry if I misunderstand, you presented a lot of information and it would be hard to develop an comprehensive response without making a list of point, facts, and concerns.That said, I would offer the opinion that you should ask you doctor for any test that you think should be considered.\u00a0\u00a0But, it is my belief that the tests you have had such as stress and echo need not be done again in the absence of new symptoms - I base this on the belief that PVC problems are \"electrical\" and are best diagnosed using EKG/ECG technologies.Congratulations on the weigh loss, that will surely help, and if you are still overweight.... well you know what you need to do.Depression and anxiety can also cause heart rhythm problems, maybe you need to treat those conditions and see if that helps.Good luck, and keep up the good work on your weight control.. and follow your diabetes treatment regiment(s).\u00a0\u00a0Al this will contribute to an increased quality of life.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the response Jerry, I definately will keep up the weight loss something that has been incredibly easy since the Dr's found out I was diabetic. A simple meter and testing after eating showed me which foods to avoid. This in turn lifted the depression as I wasn't running high blood sugars anymore and allowed me to finally kick the antidepressants (haven't looked back since). My Dr's have actually put on file that the depression was due to undiagnosed diabetes as was the incredible weight gain. Maybe one day I can get back to running which I used to love.I already have an appointment booked with my local Dr and I will broach the subject of some further testing as the original tests were done 10 or so years ago and since that time the diabetes had been running unchecked up until the middle of last year. Since the PVC's seem to be gaining in number on each holter I just want to know really that its not heart desease that is contributing to the increase.Thanks for the reply but most of all the best of health to you.",

    "question": "Back in 1999 I suffered some kind of heart event whilst climbing the stairs in my house. I had only gone a few steps up and experienced a pain in my back (thoracic area) that was sharp in nature that spread around my rib cage and caused a gripping sensation (like a giant pair of hands squeezing my rib cage) I couldn't breath and began to grey out (I didn't actually pass out) my heart was beating erratically skipping all over the place at this point then after 20/30 seconds I began to breath again (was able to get air in) and my heart went back to normal rhythm. I actually climbed the rest of the stairs and lay down to rest thinking I had had a back spasm of some kind.\u00a0\u00a0The whole incidence lasted no more than a couple of minutes in total. I was fine for a few days only mentioning this to\u00a0\u00a0my Dr at my next check-up (about a week after the event) who said I had been foolish and needed to be checked via a cardiologist. I was duly booked to see the cardiologist after being taken from the Dr's office to the local hospital (bloods drawn) and ECG taken. At a later date an echo was done and a treadmill stress test and finally a thallium scan was performed. It was noted at the time that I had a large number of pvc's during all my tests. These started a\u00a0\u00a0week or two after the event on the stairs.I was told that my heart was structurally sound and that I had not had a heart attack as first suspected although I was told that due to not going to the hospital in the first place they could not draw blood results that would have been a good indicator of a cardiac event and in future I must go to the ER if anything like this happens again. They assured me that the follow up testing would have found any damage or any abnormality with my heart and put my pvc's down to being of a neuro cardiogenic origin.Since that time I have had frequent PVC's that vary in intensity from 2-3 a minute to high teens very occasionally dropping into a pattern of every 4th or 3rd beat but generally for most of the time random but occurring every minute of everyday. Sometimes I get chest pains and light headed but have refrained from dashing to the ER each time this happens.About 1 year ago I was diagnosed with Diabetes type 2 after presenting with neuropathy. I also noticed an odd side effect that if I take a long slow deep breath I can cause an ectopic beat. I had a holter and ecg done last year after complaining of increased PVC's during excercise but was told to continue with keeping my blood sugars in line and to continue walking as a form of exercise.My question is would it be unreasonable of me to ask for another echo and thallium test due to the diabetes and the presence of frequent pvc's for all these years. The diabetes had not been detected for a long time the emg nerve tests performed and looking back at history and a previous borderline result over 9 years ago suggest this has gone unchecked for all that time (roughly that same time I suffered depression and massive weight gain). Since getting my blood sugars under excellent control I have lost 91lbs something despite previous efforts had been unobtainable due to eating 'healthy foods' that caused blood sugar increases which at that time were unknown to me. My main concern is that the diabetes has caused damage to the heart via the heart muscles itself (and is the actual cause of the frequent PVC's) or via CAD.Thanks in advance for your time and consideration and the best of health to you.",
