            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Diabetes can cause slowing of the gut and this can cause vomiting. Check his blood sugars at a lab to see if he has hypothyroidism. GERD or gastric reflux too could be a cause. It could also be due to electrolyte disturbance due to diabetes. So get his serum electrolytes measured.All these conditions except hypothyroidism can come and go.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "This helps, Thank You.I will get this checked out. He has lab tests in the next day or two, along with a Dr. appointment. I will ask about getting these tests done (I am thankful the Dr.\u00a0\u00a0and hospital are doing what they can). Oh and also I should mention his A1c is 7.4 approximately May, and he has it done every 3 months so he is due for another one. Though I will still check on these things you mention.\u00a0\u00a0 Again Thank you. You have no idea how much you have helped. It gives me another avenue to check.",

    "question": "My young son has diabetes. His sugars are well. He has had sporatic vomiting for 4 years. Recently during an episode I took him to the hosp, they did blood test looking for panciatitis. His white blood count was high they said infection some where and to bring him back in 48 hrs for retesting. I don't understand he can't have an infection every time this happens. It can happen once a month or 3 times a weak or once in 6 months. So what is it. GI is looking into it but it has gone on so long it seems forever getting answers. Also when this is happening he is pale, sick, not wanting to move any where, but when the vomiting stops in 1/2 hr he feels better. It also can last for only 1/2 hr or 5 hr sand only once did it last for 24 hrs. He can vomit once or 5 times or more. So does anyone have any idea as to what this is?",
