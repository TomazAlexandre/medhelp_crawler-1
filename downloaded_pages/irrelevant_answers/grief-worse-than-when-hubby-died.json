            "answer": "I can relate to your feelings.\u00a0\u00a0My husband died less than 2 weeks ago of lung cancer which spread to his brain.\u00a0\u00a0Of course the main cause was cigarette smoking for many years.\u00a0\u00a0He would not listen to anyone to quit or even cut back on his smoking, but finally did when he was diagnosed - too late. We were married for 44 years.\u00a0\u00a0I loved him dispite how difficult and stubborn he could be and took care of him til the end.\u00a0\u00a0I now wonder if he loved me and our kids because he refused to care for himself and left all of us heartbroken and in grief including sweet grandchildren.\u00a0\u00a0He was only 66 years old. I am grieving because I loved him, miss him but I am also angry as hell at him.\u00a0\u00a0Gramma George",

            "answer": "My mother died of Congestive Heart Failure and the diabetes filled her lungs with fluid. She died as I held her and it breaks my heart to know she died suffocated, unable to breath, follwed by a heart attack. I will never be the same. It's was an ordeal that you wish on no one.Your loss is so recent and there is a lot ahead. It will be necessary to experience the stages of the grief process in order to heal. There is no time table on this process.What has happened in the past is the past. Let it go. Although your husband did not take care of himself as he should have, he still loved you unconditionally, so don't torment yourself with the \"what if\", or \"If only I would have\"....it will drive you crazy.He is resting in peace and no longer suffering from that horrible diabetes that is so distructive. It's understandably to feel anger. I am a faithful Christian as my mother was and it is the first time that I experienced such anger towards God. Who am I to question, doubt or judge the almighty, yet, I asked, \"Why did my mother have to die\", \"Why did she have to die first and the way she did?\".\u00a0\u00a0I asked God, how could he do this to me and my family.\u00a0\u00a0It has been 2 yrs. and it means nothing to me. It is as if she died a week ago and I will never get over losing my mom, but I will accept what I can't change. I am finally beginning to feel human again, but it has been a journey from hell.You will always love your husband unconditionally as he did you and it serves no purpose to you or him to question the past. What is done is done and you must forgive him for not taking better care of himself and you must forgive yourself for doubting yourself. Celebrate his life and all the good things you both share. He is not too far in spirit, but a transition away, so he want's you simply \"live\"....it will be ok, one step and day at a time.\u00a0\u00a0Judy",

            "answer": "Stella,Pray to God to feel your heart with happy memories.Often people that our very caring when it comes to other people,just don't care for or about themselves.He didn't realize how him not caring for himself hurt others,trust me on this.All the pain you witnessed him go through near the end was his life lesson,he unfortunately learned it the hard way.And I'm so sorry that you had to see that.I believe he had to endure that pain to earn his wings,his place in heaven.Don't doubt his love for you.I certainly don't have any doubt that you loved him after reading your words.Grieving is a process,it is a very personal thing.We all take it in our own way.You may feel angry with him,its completely normal.Don't ever feel guilty for your feelings are yours,and don't be afraid to feel them,just try not to let them consume you.Everynight before you go to bed,relax,aromatherapy,soothing music,whatever it takes.Give your husband a break.Do you think if he could have looked into the future and seen that what he was doing would have cost him his life in this way he would have continued to do it,and would have purposely caused you this pain,of course not.Tell yourself I choose to move on,be happy,and forgive my husband,and just try your best with faith and hope to start a new life,I know its far from easy,but you seen what your husband endured and your still here,stronger for it! You deserve a happy life,live it to its fullest with joy and through prayer you will in time move on.You can't change any of what has occured so just let it go! God bless,Jen P.S. I wish I could give you my shoulder to cry on or a loving hug!",

            "answer": "My husband died 5 months ago from a massive heart attack which I was told, was related to his diabetes. He monitered his blood sugars very closely taking blood tests six to ten times a day.(he was on the pump) He saw an endocrinologist, a nephrologist and a retinologist routinely. He was on several medications for bp and high cholesterol and everything looked great as far as the testing results went. His cholesterol was really good-in the 140's I believe. He did not see a podiatrist regularly but checked his feet all the time and went whenever necessary.He ate the right things--he was on a meal plan with about 2400 cal. a day. We watched our fat intake, and I must say, he rarely cheated with anything.I am telling you all this because even with the best of care, diabetes is a killer. I can understand how you feel he was responsible for shortening his own life and the unfairness to you. Often times it causes a whole lot of damage before the person is even aware they have it, and I believe it is often the case especially with Type II. His doc told him it can take ten years--especially in my husband's case where the pancreas totally stops functioning.I just want to say I am sorry for your loss. It is difficult to watch someone that fails to take this disease seriously and you have paid the price as you witnessed his suffering. It's not an easy thing to watch. I hope that in time you will find some peace with this.",

    "question": "My husband died on April 30, 2009 after a long battle with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He'd lost both feet, neuropathy in both hands, congestive heart failure, kidney failure loss of bowel control, and two days before his death he was told he would lose two fingers on his right hand due to loss of circulation.\u00a0\u00a0His heart was only at 40% when admitted to the hospital, and the hospital got me out of bed to let me know he was unresponsive and had been revived twice.\u00a0\u00a0I sat with him for two hours until his poor heart gave out ... held his hand, told him how much I loved him.\u00a0\u00a0The grief was bad, but I'd had so much advance notice of his death that I felt at peace.Now, a month later, it's come crashing back down.\u00a0\u00a0On top of that, I wonder now if he really loved me ... if he did, why did he recklessly abuse his health rather than maintain even a modestly healthy lifestyle?\u00a0\u00a0He demanded premier medical care, but refused to cooperate with his caregivers.\u00a0\u00a0I look at his picture now and know that I loved him -- something he frequently doubted -- but I wonder if he had the capability of loving me in return, given how much havoc he wreaked on our lives.His friend deserted him because of his refusal to care for himself -- I was the only one left.\u00a0\u00a0And now they wonder why I'm so heartbroken.\u00a0\u00a0They feel like I should be relieved -- which in many ways I am -- but don't understand that no matter how difficult he was, I loved my husband, and I miss him so much.;Any help would be appreciated.",
