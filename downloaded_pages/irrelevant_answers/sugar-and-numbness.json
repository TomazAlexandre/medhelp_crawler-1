            "answer": "What is your diabetes history? How do you know your sugar is spiking high and low - are you self monitoring with a home glucose test meter? If you have had uncontrolled/unmanaged diabetes for a period of time your numbness could be caused by onset of Neuropathy, Neurothapy will lead to amputation. Go see a doctor asap.
