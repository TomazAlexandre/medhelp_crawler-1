            "answer": "Hi,You may be having skin tags or warts.Skin tags are extensions of all the layers of the skin and are caused by obesity, diabetes or other causes.Warts are caused by infections by viruses, leading to extensive growth of the outer layer of the skin. Warts spread through auto-inoculation as well as injuries at the sites makes them propagate, this is known as Koebner phenomenon. If this is a wart, there is a fair chance that more will crop up. Usually skin tags are smoother while warts are rougher in comparison on appearance.It is important that they are examined and then treatment and precautionary measures may be needed.Hope this helped.",

    "question": "Hi,I recently visited my General Dr and she did an HPV pap smear so the result came back negative.\u00a0\u00a0While the examination she observed something in my vaginal area and she told me they were warts.\u00a0\u00a0FYI- I've had a couple of skin tags removed as a child under my arms and neck area.\u00a0\u00a0I also have an extra piece of skin near my vaginal area which I was born with.\u00a0\u00a0She observed something around the extra piece of skin and assumed it was genital warts. I never had more than 1 partner sexually, and Im also a lesbian who is in a long term relationship, never had sexual contact with anyone else but my girlfriend.\u00a0\u00a0My girlfriend told me shes saw those extra pieces of skin since shes been with me.\u00a0\u00a0Also, my girlfriend has never seen any warts at all on herself and her pap came back negative for HPV.-Can the \"Warts\" be just skin tags?-Does my GP know whats shes seeing or should I visit a gynocologist?-What were the chances of even contracting the HPV with the my story above?",
