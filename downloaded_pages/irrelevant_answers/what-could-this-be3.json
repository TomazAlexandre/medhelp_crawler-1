            "answer": "I, too have coughed since October of 2010.\u00a0\u00a0At first I went through a round of bronchitis and pneumonia.\u00a0\u00a0I have lupus and type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Since it takes me longer to heal my doctor just kept giving me antibiotics. After that, she suggested I see a pulmonologist.\u00a0\u00a0He did a chest x-ray and tested me for whooping cough (pertussis).\u00a0\u00a0He then decided that it was probably allergies or asthma and gave me nose spray, steroids for a week and an inhaler.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing worked.\u00a0\u00a0I finally went to an ENT who scoped my throat this morning and he discovered that my TONSILS were huge!\u00a0\u00a0I am back on steroids and Augmentin (antibiotic) for 10 days. The cough was just so bad and got to the point of gagging.\u00a0\u00a0So, my advice would be to keep looking for the problem.\u00a0\u00a0If this doesn't work, I'm back to the doctor...I just have to stop coughing!\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps....",

            "answer": "Hi.I would say the next time you start coughing up the green phlegm, then take a sample to your doctor and have it checked for the organasism, or bacteria, which maybe causing this.That way they can see what is causing this if it bacteria it can be cleared up with the right antibiotic, to tackle the bacteria.If that is not the cause, then i am saying Lupus can affect the lungs in numerous ways, pnuemonitis, pleuritic, breathing problems, etc, etc,This maybe connected to the Lupus, so i would mention this problem to the rheumy.Good LuckNicola",
