            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Check your heart rate, this will give an indication of the effects of your medications. Beta Blockers usually reduce the heart rate. Also, occasional palpitations are a common occurrence. But if the shortness of breath persists, have a stress test done. Certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause these symptoms. Check with your doctor to rule out these conditions.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
