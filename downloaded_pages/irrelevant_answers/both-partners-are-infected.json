            "answer": "There are no contraindications for suppressive therapy with either heart disease or diabetes.You can't pass herpes back and forth once the two people have the same type, so you don't necessarily need suppressive therapy for protection of the other partner. Suppressive or episodic therapy to prevent outbreaks\u00a0\u00a0is appropriate if you want to go that route.",

            "answer": "I have read that there is some risk of spreading the site of outbreak from two HSV2 positive people having unprotected sex. Example, if you have a spot of broken or irritated skin and your partner has an outbreak or is shedding then there is a risk of getting an outbreak in that area where the broken skin is. My initial outbreak 2 yrs ago was vaginal but, even tho I've been very careful, my outbreaks have spread to my anus and my butt cheek. I've never had anal sex so I assume I spread it there by wiping after going to the bathroom...and the sore on my butt cheek could've been caused by spooning naked with my BF who is also HSV pos. I just can't imagine any other way I would've gotten sores in those spots.I'm not sure how high the risk is but there is a risk.",

            "answer": "Actually once you are infected with herpes - the virus has infected the entire nerve ganglia from the waist down. You can't spread an infection to where you already have it.When the virus reactivates at the base of the nerve ganglia - it can go down any nerve that it wants from there. Most folks certainly have their \"Usual\" places where they get ob's but you shouldn't be surprised to have ob's anywhere in the entire boxer short area as we call it.\u00a0\u00a0It's nothing you did or nothing your partner did - it's just the way the virus works.grace",

At that time partner 2 was informed and professed not to care and wanted to continue as if there were no problem.\u00a0\u00a0Now that partner 2 has been diagnosed, is there any thing else that can create a problem for the two partners.\u00a0\u00a0They both had been monagomous for 41 and 31 years respectively.\u00a0\u00a0They are about to enter into long term relationship and marriage.\u00a0\u00a0Partner 2 has a compromised immune system due to several disease processes ( CHF, Diabetes ) and the cardiologist says absolutely not to the medication for herpes. Partner 1 is relatively healthy without any disease processes known and is not currently on any medication for herpes, but is beginning to have more symptoms since becoming more sexually active with partner 2.\u00a0\u00a0Is it safe to continue with their relationship and can they give it back and forth?",
