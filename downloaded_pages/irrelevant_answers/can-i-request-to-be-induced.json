            "answer": "Most doctors won'to, especially if you've had a complication-free pregnancy. Its best for the baby to be in there as close to 40 weeks as possible. I've had nothing but problems (vomiting for 7 months, gestational diabetes, anemia, swelling ankles since 15 weeks, bleeding at 20 weeks plus a month of bed rest) and doctor and midwife still won't induce me until after my due date. If you've been complication free, I think you can manage a few more weeks.",
