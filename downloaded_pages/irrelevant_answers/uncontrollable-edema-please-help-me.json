    "question": "About 2 years ago I started waking up in the middle of the night with my hands, fingers, and knuckles grossly swollen. So swollen to the point I would be in pain. It looked like my hands were full of fluid. I could barley move or bend my fingers and felt as though they were parylized. Also I began gaining weight for no apparent reason. It started about when I got my gall bladder removed I have been tevery doctort. All were to no evail. Since my hand thing started ... \"it\" then moved to my wrists, arms and up into my shoulders. wrist, arm, and shoulder thing, \"it\" decided to add my face and eyes to the problem. I wake up with my eye lids so swollen, I look as if I'v had an all night cry-a-thon. My eyes water, burn and are red all the time. It takes several hours with ice to \"somewhat\" make the swelling in my eyes go down. I noticed that the swelling would ALWAYS begin when I was \"at rest\", i.e., sleeping, sitting more than 30 min or just being still for TV or a movie etc... \"It\" has decided my hands, fingers, wrists, arms, shoulders, face and eyes weren't enough ... \"it\" has now claimed my legs, ankles, feet, heels, and yes ... even my toes. . I get gross adema-like-endentions in my ankles, legs, and feet. Now, since this all started, I have gained about 45 pounds. I do not eat like an obese person. . I have poliquistic oovary syndrome and my gyno has said it can cause my insulin levels not to be ok. Ive had every test possible, even for diabetes and nothing.",
