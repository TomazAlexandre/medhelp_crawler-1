            "answer": "It seems to me that doctors all do things differently. I've seen mine every 4 or 5 weeks with an ultrasound each time. But I have 2 friends who are also pregnant and it was more like every 6 or 7 for them. But you should be having your anatomy scan soon and should be able to find out gender for sure! When is your next appt?",

            "answer": "All my Dr does is weigh me, blood pressure,check my pee for protein,and listen to the baby's heart beat.Did you have all your first trimester screens and blood work done thay u wanted to get? If so I don't think you missed anything important. I only had one scan to determine the position of the baby\u00a0\u00a0and at 20 weeks I'll have the anotomy scan. You do need to start going through. Soon will be the sugar tolerance test to rule out gestational diabetes.",

After my next appointment it'll be every 2 weeks until I'm like 35 then every week.\u00a0\u00a0That's how most doctors are, I thought.\u00a0\u00a0That's how anyone around here is. I've had blood drawn 3 times before my appointment at 18 weeks. We already know we are having a boy, but my anatomy scan is at 21 weeks and I'm so excited to see how much he has changed! I couldn't imagine waiting any longer than 4 weeks to go.. it seems like it takes too long anyway",
