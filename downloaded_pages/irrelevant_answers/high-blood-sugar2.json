            "answer": "You don't really give enough details to be sure what is going on, but some thoughts:The stress of your husband being in the ICU could certainly raise your blood sugars. Have they just been high since he was hospitalized?You don't mention how long you have been diagnosed (I assume with Type 2). Or if your numbers WERE stable and are now rising. It is, unfortunately, a progressive disease. If you have had it for several years the medicine you are taking may no longer be adequate to control your blood sugar and you should see your doctor about making changes.Finally, you don't mention what other changes you have made. Food? Exercise? Maintaining a healthy weight? All these things greatly influence blood sugar. If you have been unable to get your blood sugar stable at all, these are things you need to work on. I hope your husband gets better soon.",
