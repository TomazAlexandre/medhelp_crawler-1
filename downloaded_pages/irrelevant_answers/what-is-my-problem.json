            "answer": "You may be iron deficient or anemic.\u00a0\u00a0This can make a person have a lack of energy and feel like sleeping a lot.\u00a0\u00a0When was the last time a doctor ordered a complete blood count and looked at your ferritin (iron stores)?You may have a sluggish thyroid- have you had the function of this checked lately?\u00a0\u00a0Those with hypothyroid can feel low energy.Depression and stress can also leave a person drained of energy.\u00a0\u00a0Are you experiencing either of these in your life at this time?Cancer I believe can also cause fatigue, but hopefully, that's not the cause!Sleep apnea can make a person feel tired all day, because of the periods of insufficient oxygen when not breathing while sleeping at night- have you ever been tested for this?I don't know if your off-balance feeling is related to your fatigue- but there are a variety of parts to your vestibular system, which a doctor needs to be in charge of you getting evaluated.\u00a0\u00a0They may want to do a brain scan.\u00a0\u00a0They may want to check the strength in your legs to see if it is equal in both of them.\u00a0\u00a0They may want to send you to an ENT doctor to do testing about your inner ear and a VNG test to see how well your eyes are tracking.\u00a0\u00a0They may want to take an x-ray or do a scan of your neck to see if any thing is getting pinched, as the neck too is a part of the vestibular system.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Extreme fatigue could be due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems. Another possibility is sleep disturbances (like sleep apnea, imbalance of rapid eye and non rapid eye movement sleep etc.). You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, low Vit b12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium. Hyperthyroidism too causes increased sweating and tiredness.\u00a0\u00a0 A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Diabetes too is a possibility.\u00a0\u00a0Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
