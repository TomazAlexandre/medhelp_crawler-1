            "answer": "Hi,Balanitis is an inflammation of the glans penis. Inflammation has many possible causes, including irritation by environmental substances, physical trauma, and infection by a wide variety of pathogens, including bacteria, virus, or fungus. Diagnosis may include careful identification of the cause with the aid of a good patient history and complete physical examination. To determine which factors are contributing to balanitis, a swab may be taken for bacterial and yeast culture. Urethral cultures may also be necessary, and occasionally, blood tests for syphilis and diabetes. In persistent cases, a skin biopsy is appropriate to determine whether there is an underlying skin disease or cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Frequently the most useful treatment is a combination of the following: astringent compressess, topical antifungal medication, topical antiseptic or antibiotic or mild topical steroid.The main aim of treatment is to keep the head of the penis and foreskin clean and dry. This should prevent infection and thus complications. Daily showering with particular attention to cleaning this area is necessary. If you are prone to develop balanitis a few hours after sexual contact, wash the area shortly after.The problem may recur, as in your case. The treatment may be repeated. In refractory cases, circumcision may be necessary to prevent recurrence. If it persists, it is recommended that you see your doctor for further evaluation of your condition. Take care and regards.",
