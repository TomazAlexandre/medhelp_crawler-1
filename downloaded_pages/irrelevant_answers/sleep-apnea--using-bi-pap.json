            "answer": "The sporadic use of Bi-PAP for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may confer some benefit but, at best, much less than consistent use of Bi-PAP.\u00a0\u00a0A person who uses this mode of treatment in a sporadic way is not really treating his OSA.And, there is a relationship between OSA and diabetes to the extent that the treatment of OSA often reduces the severity and increases the ease of control of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Most important is that smoking and being extremely overweight makes both conditions worse.\u00a0\u00a0Regardless of whatever other treatment this man takes, he will remain in poor health if he does not lose weight, control his OSA with the Bi-PAP and treat his diabetes optimally.",

    "question": "59 year old adult male. Diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea and given a bi-level machine for use.\u00a0\u00a0Should he be using this every night/all night?\u00a0\u00a0So far the use is sporadic so I am wondering if there is any benefit being gained.\u00a0\u00a0I might also add that he has type 2 diabetes (not under control even with insulin), COPD,has had 1 heart attack (stent put in), smokes 2 packs a day and is extremely overweight. He will not do anything to change these things, just takes the pills/shots and figures that is all that is needed.\u00a0\u00a0The main thing I am wondering is if the sporadic use of Bi-Pap is better than not at all?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
