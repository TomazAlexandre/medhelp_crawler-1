    "question": "In general to the Forum, my blood sugar and blood pressure were creeping up on me. At first I thought it was old age \"creeping up\" but I realized it was old habits. Primarily too much alcohol and fancy cakes. I quit both. After many years of self abuse, I finally recognized that alcohol especially had become toxic to my general health. I wasn't an alcoholic but rather someone with a very high tolerance to drinking. At first I tried to kid myself that stopping hard drink and just keeping with the beer would work. It didn't. I stopped all of it and don't bring sugar junk food into my home. Works for me.",
