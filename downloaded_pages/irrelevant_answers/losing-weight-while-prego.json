    "question": "Well I am overweight, I wanted to lose weight before concieving but I am 2 weeks late\u00a0\u00a0and might be prego! I was wondering if any of you have successfully lost weight or stayed the same while pregnant. They only thing I plan on doing as far as losing weight is to eat healthy foods and not to overeat like I tend to do and to also excercise. I know if Im prego I shouldnt overdo myself on exercise but light exercise and walking wont hurt! :) I just would like to minimize the chance of getting gestational diabetes or preclampsia while prego! :) Thoughts, opinions, concerns, etc are all welcome!!! :DThanks!Susan",
