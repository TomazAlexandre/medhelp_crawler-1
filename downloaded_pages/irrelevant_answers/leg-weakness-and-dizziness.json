            "answer": "Hello and welcome to the medhelp forum. Your symptoms could be non specific and point towards various etiologies. Weight gain itself could cause dizziness and weakness in lower limbs. Dehydration, anemia, hormonal imbalance including diabetes, electrolyte disturbances could cause fatigue in legs. Cervical disc degenerative disease needs to be checked for since disc prolapse in neck can cause dizziness and lumbar nerve root compression in case of canal stenosis.\u00a0\u00a0You need to consult a physician for detailed evaluation including complete metabolic panel check with B12 and Vitamin D levels. These should give direction to the diagnosis. Wishing you good luck.",

    "question": "Lately i have felt like my legs always feel weak.\u00a0\u00a0They are fully functioning and I am still pretty active.\u00a0\u00a0Work out, play sports, etc.\u00a0\u00a0With that said, I have put on weight lately, so I am concerned about diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Along with the weakness I feel dizzy from time to time.\u00a0\u00a0Not so much that I fall or even lose balance, just more of a light headedness.\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned that it could be something more severe, or is just a man turning 40 and going through some physical changes do to age and weight?",
