            "answer": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Your brother sounds like more of a type 2 candidate than type 1.\u00a0\u00a0Considering family history and the change in health, I think you are right to be concerned.For many people, there are two primary reasons for not going to the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0First is not being able to afford it, and you don't mention that as an issue.\u00a0\u00a0The second is psychological.\u00a0\u00a0People don't want to hear what the doctor might tell them.\u00a0\u00a0It's easier to just keep doing what you're doing than it is to take care of yourself properly.\u00a0\u00a0Your brother likely has several issues which should get him to the doctor, and at the age he is, he's likely to also not understand the future consequences of his actions because he thinks he's indestructable.\u00a0\u00a0It's a common attitude among teens.\u00a0\u00a0Is there anyone from his dad's side of the family who could talk to him and explain the dangers?",
