            "answer": "Hello, JMendl,We're all volunteers here and not medical professionals, so be sure to work with your pump trainer and/or endo on this topic, too.It happens that I'm also a pumper and a long-time diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have a Minimed pump, but I had a similar experience with my Cozmo -- where nothing seemed to work well.\u00a0\u00a0In that case, I contacted their 24*7 tech support line (I'm sure MM has the same type of service) and worked thru all the trouble-shooting with them to rule out user-error, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I recommend that you contact them again again again -- until you get the issue resolved.Your 'test' where no insulin comes out even when disconnected should be proof-positive that something is amiss.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have a local pump trainer or Certified Diabetes Educator who can work with you in person to see what's what?I learned the hard way that we need to have a 'low tech' backup on hand at all times.\u00a0\u00a0That means syringes & insulin in my pump pouch.\u00a0\u00a0Since high BGs can interfere with one's ability to reason thru complex problem-solving and interfere with our ability to be patient and keep steady emotions, you might ask your doc/CDE for guidelines on taking a shot (of rapid-acting and/or longer acting) insulin while you're working thru the issues.Good luck with this.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps others will have ideas, too.",

    "question": "I have been diabetic for 25 years.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on an insulin pump for 11 years (not the same one though).\u00a0\u00a0In December of 2006 my Paradigm MiniMed pump started giving me \"No Delivery\" messages.\u00a0\u00a0I changed everything almost 10 times a day.\u00a0\u00a0I called MiniMed and they begrudgingly sent me a \"new\" pump (which I found out was refurbished).\u00a0\u00a0I had no problem for 3 months and now, it is starting the \"No Delivery\" messages.\u00a0\u00a0When I disconnect from my insertion site and try to give a bolus, nothing will come out at the end of the tube.\u00a0\u00a0That's how I know it's not my insertion site. I called MiniMed and they have sent me new tubing, needles, and reservoirs.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing is working.\u00a0\u00a0Could I have gotten another faulty pump?\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it says that it's been giving me insulin, but when I disconnect and check the tubing, nothing is coming out yet it shows that it's giving a bolus just fine.\u00a0\u00a0I am very very frustrated (especially when my blood sugars are in the 300s for days at a time).\u00a0\u00a0Any advice?\u00a0\u00a0Should I just buy a new pump...maybe Diesetronic?\u00a0\u00a0I am so frustrated.\u00a0\u00a0I just don't know what to do.\u00a0\u00a0I've never had this many problems.\u00a0\u00a0I had the pump 2 years before it started doing this.",
