    "question": "I'm 21 and have been diagnosed as a Type 1 just over a year ago. My average HBA1C is around 7 and I am very active and have no let my diabetes stop me from doing anything.Just recently, my levels have been way out of range. I'd wake up in the range of 5-6(100-120) and within an hr or so after eating my usual breakfast and taking my relevant insulin, my levels would be around 17(140).
