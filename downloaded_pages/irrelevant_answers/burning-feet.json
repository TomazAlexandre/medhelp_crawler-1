            "answer": "Hello,Burning feet are a common complaint and can be caused by a number of conditions some are local and minor, and some are more serious. Burning feet are more common in those with diabetes as part of the neuropathy (nerve damage) that can develop. A burning foot may be mild and local and easily treatable or it may indicate a more serious general medical problem that needs further investigation.The more common causes of burning feet are:* many feet just ache and burn at the end of a long day, especially in those who are on their feet all day or are overweight (due to mechanical overload)* hot and sweaty feet can cause a burning foot sensation (and may be related to the mechanical overload problem)* the neuropathy that occurs in diabetes can cause a burning feet (common)* other types of neuropathy (nerve damage) that can cause a burning foot include those that occur in chronic alcoholism, vitamin deficiencies (vitamin B)* blood disorders (eg thrombocytopenia, pernicious anemia, erythromelalgia ) can cause burning feet* Reflex dystrophy or complex regional pain syndrome can follow trauma (including surgery) and cause a burning foot sensation* nerve entrapments, such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, which is the compression of a nerve at the inside of the ankle joint can cause a burning sensation (most likely cause in your case)* a localized burning sensation may be due to other specific problems. If its in the front of the foot only, it could be metatarsalgia, Morton's neuroma or some other cause. Athletes foot or a fungal infection can also cause a burning sensation in the area of the infection.Diagnosis for symptoms such as burning feet leave much to be desired from internet postings. I suggest you visit your local Podiatrist, rheumatologist or a neurologist for further testing and diagnosis.RegardsDr Foot",
