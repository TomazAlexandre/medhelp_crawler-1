            "answer": "Hi!I would discontinue the protein powder for now. If it is whey protein isolate there's a chance that your body does't recognize it as regular protein. And therefore it might be treated as offensive. You can do Dr. Coca's Pulse Test for allergies and sensitivities. It's a free download, takes a week to complete. Excellent diagnostic tool!Indoor enviroments in the winter tend to be dry. Use a humidifier. Drink water throughout the day in small quantities but 1h away from meals. Avoid sodas, alcohol and caffeine -a little is okDo oil pulling with extra virgin coconut oil every morning before breakfast. Your mouth, gums and teeth will be eternally grateful! Check it out.Protect your lips from the cold air. Use only\u00a0\u00a0organic products.Are you perhaps of Japanese origin? I have many Japanese friends!Post again for more info or to give update.Blessings,Nikodicreta",

            "answer": "Hi, welcome to the forum, the possibilities of dry mouth are inadequate water intake, anxiety, hot climate etc. Other important causes are Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, Amyloidosis, Sarcoidosis, HIV infection (unlikely) and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.You need to under go investigations like blood sugar, salivary mucin content, HIV ELIZA, chest radiograph to rule out the causes. Maintain good oral hygiene. Drugs like Pilocarpine or Cevimeline, which prevents dry mouth, should only be taken after consultation from physician. Take care and regards.",
