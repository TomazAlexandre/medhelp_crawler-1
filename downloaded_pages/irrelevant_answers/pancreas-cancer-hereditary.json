            "answer": "According to reports put out by the pathology dept. at John Hopkins, cancer of the pancreas can be a genetic disease - caused by DNA changes (mutations). The changes can be inherited, meaning we're born with them, or they can be acquired, developing after we're born. When the changes are inherited, pancreatic cancer does run in some families. If it's acquired, the DNA changes can be the result of either bad luck during cell replication or by exposure to carcinogens.",

            "answer": "k2626, God be with you!I have a strange theory about genetics and chronic illnesses... I know this may sound stupid but it was a passing thought that crossed my mind about a year ago...My hubby and I had our oldest son, Duncan, in June 2003.My hubby was hospitalized in July 2004 with acute pancreatitis (due to diabetes and high triglycerides).\u00a0\u00a0After this, my hubby cannot eat or tolerate certain foods, including hot dogs...My hubby and I had our youngest son, Toby, in Sept 2006.Duncan has no issues with hot dogs BUT Toby, while he enjoys eating them, will have major bowel movement issues after eating one for days afterwards!\u00a0\u00a0I can't help but wonder if my hubby's illnesses changed his DNA and passed on the aquired intolerance to hot dogs to Toby.Twelve days after Toby was born, Roger had a heart attack... I recently had Essure implanted so NO MORE KIDS! LOLGood luck and God bless you all!!!",
