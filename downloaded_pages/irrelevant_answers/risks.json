    "question": "Aunt Jessi,Just a follow up question for my past posts.The massage therapist touched my anus with her fingers, inserting them just a little as she gave me a hand job with the massage oil, until completion.\u00a0\u00a0Is there any risk for STDs, HIV, herpes from this?\u00a0\u00a0I guess im thinking about the risks (regarding hand job and finger in anus) with her hands/fingers, if they had cuts or sores.\u00a0\u00a0I didnt see sores or ask if there are cut/sores.\u00a0\u00a0 How about the towels and bedding if reused.\u00a0\u00a0Does this pose a risk too since i was naked?Thanks",
