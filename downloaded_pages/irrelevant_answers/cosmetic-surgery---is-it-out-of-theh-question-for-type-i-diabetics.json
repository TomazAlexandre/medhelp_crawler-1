Having surgery on the face usually takes longer to heal as you are constantly using the muscles they cannot stay still to heal.I would suggest that your sister talk to her endocrinologist to see how she can better control her diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I would also have the endocrinologist talk with the surgeon to find the best way for your sister to safely have the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0They should work together as a team to make this possible for your sister.\u00a0\u00a0If they will not help her , I would getr another opinion.",
