            "answer": "Please check out information about ortho static intolerance; specifically P.O.T.S. I have many of those symptoms and received the same incorrect diagnosis as you. Sometimes women are better when they are pregnant because there is more blood circulating through your body at that time. Keep track of your blood pressure and heart rate for a few days. If you have a heart rate monitor with a chest strap, wear it for several hours at a time and note the changes in your heart rate as you perform duties around your home. The tell tale sigh is an increase of 30+ beats per minute increase when going from lying to sitting, or sitting to standing. Your blood pressure may drop when your heart rate goes up and that has a name for it too. I'm on my phone so I can't share my links, but if you go to a site called \"dinet\" they will have a tremendous amount of information about pots and other forms of dysautonomia.After you collect this info for a few days- try walking for a few minutes if you can, climb up and down some stairs. Then share it with your doctor. They may refer you or perform other tests themselves if they can.Don't be discourageed if they have never heard of it. It's rare, and not many doctors have training in it, so you may need to search for one who does. But if you have those kind of jumps I'm talking about it will be worth the fight. Feel free to pm me if you have more questions or need advice. I could be way off, but your post sounds very familiar from mine and so many others I've read. Good-luck!",

I will have to have an ambulatory ecg fitted and an echocardiogram to make sure that they are not missing any serious conditions - this will be on the 16th August.Thank you all for your replies and suggestions x",

    "question": "Hello,I am a 24 year old female with no known medical problems.I have suffered with undiagnosed dizziness for at least 4years.I have been pregnant twice (3yr old and 14wk old) my symptoms disappeared during both pregnancies.I had many apps with doctors all of whom told me that nothing was wrong with me and/or I was basically making it up. 3months after my 1st son was born I went back to docs who assured me it was an anxiety issue (althought I didn't feel anxious/panicky) so prescribed anxiety medications including ones for depression (not that I felt that I ever felt depressed). None worked.Today, for the first time since 2nd son was born, I have experienced an awful feeling of unsteadiness. Again, I truly do not believe that I am suffering depression, I am really enjoying life. I also havent felt anxious to my knowledge, I havent been staying indoors, I got to groups with my children,take regular strolls to shops, visit family, go on daytrips etc... I was simply pottering around the house,doing no lifting or anything strenuous, out of the blue my heart started thumping so hard, it literally felt like I had been out running for an hour, at the same time I felt extremely unsteady and literally staggered to the sofa, falling into the wall with each step. I sat down and after around 15 seconds the palpitations stopped but the unsteadiness remained. My head felt so strange, all along my jaw, right at the nape of my neck and the crown area jus felt really fuzzy like theres a load of pressure. Also there seems to be pressure around my eyes and where my neck joins my shoulders it seems to go really stiff, when I move my neck in any way it feels almost like my skin is too tight.Its really hard to explain the exact feeling.45 minutes later the pressure feeling is still pretty strong but no more palpitations.Thank you very much for taking the time to read my post and Thank you for any replies. It is truly appreciated.",
