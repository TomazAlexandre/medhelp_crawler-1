            "answer": "Yes, you certainly should get tested. You posted on the Type 2 diabetes board because Type 1 is (incorrectly) labelled \"Juvenile Type\", but you could get Type 1 at any age (ditto type 2). Make sure they do an A1C or an OGTT or both. If you don't have diabetes, you certainly do need to see a doctor to figure out what is going on. Let us know how it goes.",

            "answer": "\"you'd be surprised at how often doctors ASK me if I am diabetic.\"This statement doesn't make sense. Has any doctor ever tested you for diabetes? When doctors suspect something they normally order a blood test to verify, they don't stop at a no answer.Go see a doctor ASAP. Test until he/she discovers the root problem or problems causing your discomfort. Go here, read and educate yourself about these tests then discuss them with your doctor. http://tinyurl.com/medical-testsCBC (Complete Blood Count)Fasting glucoseHemoglobin A1cHepatitis (HAV, HVB, HCV)OGTT (Oral Glucose Tolerance)Thyroid Hormone; T3 (Triiodothyronine) & T4 (Thyroxine)",

    "question": "So, I am a 23 year old female, 5'9 and 140lbs. I know you probably are all rolling your eyes, but you'd be surprised at how often doctors ASK me if I am diabetic.I am having a whole lot of onset symptoms.-Recently, I cannot stop drinking and I have to urinate approximately ever 30min - one hour. Even when I don't drink a lot, I still urinate quite frequently.-I have NEVER had problems with my skin but lately, my skin has been INCREDIBLY dry, so bad to a point where I can't write with a pen that the chapping on my hands is so bad. Its even dry around my vaginal area which is really really strange.- I have been getting frequent yeast infections which I have never had up until a few months ago.- Ear infections are constant, and keep coming back or wont respond to anti biotics. Ringing in one ear, facial numbness, slight weakness on left side....- I have trouble seeing now, I thought I may need glasses but who knows, it could be all related.- I am rapidly losing weight.- The tips of my fingers and toes and numb along with the inside of my vaginal labia (sorry)I am not sure what to think, I do know that if doctors constantly asking me this - so could someone give me an input on what they think?Thanks",
