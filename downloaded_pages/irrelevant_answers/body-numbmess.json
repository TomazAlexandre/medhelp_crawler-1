            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Crestor that you are taking to lower the cholesterol is also known to cause peripheral neuropathies that could be causing the numbness. It could also be due to peripheral artery disease. The other possibility is that beyond a point your blood pressure really falls thus hampering circulation. Hence a 24 hour blood pressure monitoring should be done. Diabetes and hypothyroidism should be ruled out.\u00a0\u00a0Do consult your doctor regarding these possibilities. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hey There,Sorry if i am in the wrong place. I am taking crestor right now for my high cholesterol and i do have blood pressure. For the last 2 weeks, whenever i lay around or don't do any movements, my arm goes numb within 4-8 seconds, same for my legs and feet. When i say numb i mean i feel a tingling sensation within my arm, hands, feet and legs. I do not know what it is so i would appreciate some help. Could it be bad blood circulation? I also have been having some pain below my rib cage, right where my liver is.Thanks",
