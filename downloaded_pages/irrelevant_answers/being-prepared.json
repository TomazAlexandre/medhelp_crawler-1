            "answer": "I am sorry to hear about your father in-laws condition. But, since this is the type 2 diabetes forum there's not much we can add that hasn't already been mentioned by nurses and administrators. As far as who is correct - nurses or administrators - both are as the dying process is as variable as birth. For a better understanding on how to prepare, I suggest you Google 'end-of-life care' for FAQ's\u00a0\u00a0and also discuss palliative care with the hospice staff.",

    "question": "My father in law has dry gangrene on 4 toes on his right foot and half of the same foot closest to the toes. The nurses have now found the beginning of a sore on the left foot. He also has diabetes, PVD, heart failure, and renal failure. Because he is 80 the doctors feel it is too risky to amputate his foot or leg. Now they say a secondary infection has set in and necrosis (Hope I'm saying or spelling this one correctly). He has lost so much weight that he looks emasciated, has no appetite, but constantly asks for water. He is in constant pain and is sleeping a lot. The nurses told us that he is terminal but could last 6 months to several years. The administrator of the home says sepsis will set in and he will go quickly. We've tried to arrange an appt with the doctor at the home for 4 days and still waiting. We have also arranged for hospice care.I guess my question is: who is right (the nurses or the administrator) and what should I prepare my husband and our children for (and myself). Time wise, (even though we are aware that no one knows the hour) generally what are we looking at.This discussion is related to/posts/show/449561.",
