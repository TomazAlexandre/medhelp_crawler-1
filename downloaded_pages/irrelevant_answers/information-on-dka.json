            "answer": "I am the mom of a type one diabetic, not physician.\u00a0\u00a0DKA happens when the blood sugars are high and the body by product is ketones.\u00a0\u00a0We have found that the be4stway to avoid this is by having our daughter check her blood 6-8 times a day.\u00a0\u00a0When her blood sugar is over 225 we have her check for ketone thru her urine.\u00a0\u00a0If she has ketones we give her extra no carb fluids and contact per endocrinologist on how to adjust her insulin dosage.\u00a0\u00a0 We do this because sometimes she has ketones due to being ill other times it is a missed bolus from the pump or not enough insulin.I would suggest you talk to your Childs endocrinologist or CDE on better ways for you as a team to get this situation under control.\u00a0\u00a0If they will not help you I would suggest you get a second opinion. For another pediatric endocrinologist.Being admitted that many times in 2 years is way too many.If your son is on shots I would suggest\u00a0\u00a0 thinking about going on pump therapy or going on to more frequent shots daily.I hope this helps",
