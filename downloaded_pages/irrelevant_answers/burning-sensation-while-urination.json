            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!What you have could be a recurrent UTI or a STD. It could also be due to a stone in the urinary system. However increased frequency of urine is also seen in diabetis mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Small for size bladder is another cause and so also neurogenic bladder. Another possibility is a polyp or a growth inside the urethra. At times a hair too grows inwards and keeps tickling the urethra causing a need to urinate. A frenulum tag too can cause this type of sensation.You must talk to your physician regarding all these possibilities. You would need some more tests beside urine analysis to reach a confirmed diagnosis.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
