            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin that isn't accompanied by other obvious skin changes, such as a rash, is most often caused by dry skin (xerosis).Other causes of itchy skin may be atopic dermatitis(eczema),contact dermatitis, neurodermatitis(lichen simplex) and internal diseases like diabetes,kidney or liver diseases.Please get your blood sugar levels evaluated. Also consult a dermatologist and discuss the above possibilities with him.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I do have MS (mild). I have itchin. it started on my neck (side n back) last year. I did scratch n it left my neck raw then some darkening of the skin. Now it is my face...cheeks, upper eyelids n under eyes (redness) n under my neck. It did leave some darkenin of skin from scratchin. Cold compresses does relieve it some what. I just have to resist from scratchin (so i rub it) as this eventually calms it down. i m goin to dr. soon. I do take benadryl\u00a0\u00a0but only at nite as it does put me to sleep. I don't think its psoriasis. Nothin is there till i scratch. What do you think?",
