            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Yes, you should get yourself examined by an ENT specialist for any inner ear problem. Sometimes jumps can cause problems like headaches in people who have trouble adjusting to heights. However that was two years ago, so in a way you cannot attribute your symptoms to those jumps. It would do you good to consult a sleep specialist too. You could be having anemia, diabetes or hypothyroidism which can cause all these type of symptoms.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
