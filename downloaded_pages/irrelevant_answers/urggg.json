    "question": "So I went in on Monday to be induced due to my gestational diabetes . they started me off on cervidil for twelve hours then started pitocin. I went in being 50% effaced and not dilated at all. The cervidil softened me to 55% and the pitocin have me some painful contractions but did not put me into labor... They checked me afterand iI was . A fingertip dilated so they did the cervidil once again and that did absolutely nothing... Started me on the pitocin again and once again nothing... Sothey sent me home ... I go back tomorrow at 6 am to start on pitocin ONCE AGAIN! And if it doesn't work were going to do a c section which at this point I really don't care if I have one haha. Just thought I'd keep you ladies updated!",
