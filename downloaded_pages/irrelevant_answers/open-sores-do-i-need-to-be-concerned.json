    "question": "I was diagnosed on my biopsy with numerous groups of follicular epithelium and occassional groups of Hurthle cells and told to come back in 6 months and because of my insurance I cannot just go any where for a second opinion. The last week and a half I have noticed open sores under my armpits and on side of breast is this something I need to be concerned about? I have not changed anything no new medicines and no new soaps everything is the same that I been using. Should I contact my doctor? I am extremely tired all the time and never feel like eating.",
