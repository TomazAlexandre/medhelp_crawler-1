    "question": "Over the last 4 weeks, I have suffered from nausea and vomiting. This is not daily, but I have vomitted every 6-7 days over this past month.I have no alcohol clonsumption, eating habits and appetite have not changed from my regular (except of course on the days when vomitting is present), and I find that I am totally exhausted after these bouts. I have no fever, and only slight discomfort.I frequently have very loose stools when the vomitting is present.Can this be a symptom of diabetes or perhaps an ulcer?",
