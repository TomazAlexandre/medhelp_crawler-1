Many folks have reactions to it too and you certainly don't want to make this worse.this could be herpes but it sounds like it's not. being seen and getting a proper work up is the best thing you can do.grace",

    "question": "So - just like everyone else here, I have the age old question of \"Is this herpes?\" Here's the story:A couple of weeks ago (4 maybe?), I groomed my pubic region. I typically break out, so when a few spots popped up, I wasn't too concerned. However they have not gone away yet. I thought they were pimples, so I tried popping one - I guess a mistake. Something did come out, a hard white piece and the area started to bleed, so I figured it was a pimple. Next, I started getting the same thing on my right inner thigh, that's when I started to get a little worried. About a week ago, I noticed two little spots on my penis, not at the base and not under or on the head - but in the middle, on the underside. They were super close together, and with this time of year the bugs are getting bad - so I thought maybe a spider bite. However, a couple more have popped up in the past couple of days around the penis - again, in the middle but not clustered.For the past few days (about 3) I've been putting neosporin on my pubic region (where I shaved) to see if it'd clear up, and it had in fact started to - but they're still there and looking like just a general outbreak. I've done some looking online as to what herpes vesicles look like, and they're eerily close to what I have. I will be going in tomorrow morning for an STD test at the local county health department to verify my suspicions.I've been only sexually active with two partners in my life, and one is my wife. She however, has had several more partners (four total I believe) and most recently she had an affair and had unprotected sex with him - this was about 3-4 months ago. I am diabetic, and have had some \"things\" on my penis in the past, but chalked them up as a male yeast infection knowing it is possible, if not common for uncontrolled male diabetics. Also in the past I've noticed little blisters around my fingernails, though again this was during a very uncontrolled state of my diabetes (thus thinking just an infection or super dry skin) - but have since realized that this could also be a sign of herpes. My wife does get cold sores from time to time, and has never exhibited any classic symptoms of herpes; I'm trying to 1) track down where and when I could have become infected, and 2) if these are real world typical symptoms.Sorry for the long \"story\", but I've tried to put in as much relevant information as possible to help with an \"unofficial\" diagnosis / idea as to what's going on. Thanks for reading!",
