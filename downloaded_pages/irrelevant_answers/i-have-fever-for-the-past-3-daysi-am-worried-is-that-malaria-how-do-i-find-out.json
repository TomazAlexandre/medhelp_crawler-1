            "answer": "Hi, many things cause night sweats:Anxiety.\u2022Hyperthyroidism.\u2022Diabetes insipidus.\u2022Nocturnal hypoglycaemia (in diabetics).\u2022Medications, e.g. over-the-counter antipyretics, antihypertensives, antipsychotics (can cause rebound temperature symptoms).\u2022Drug or alcohol abuse.\u2022Obstructive sleep apnoea.\u2022Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.\u2022Night terrorsMalaria causes sweating as well, and TB. What other symptoms do you have?Do you have a cough, fatigue, nausea anything else besides fever? Do you live iin India or another country that has indemic malaria?II would go to the doctor and get a complete blood count, a blood test for malaria, thryoid test and fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A 1 C, and a skin test or Xray (if you had the BCG vaccine) for TB, unless you can only afford to do a few tests then just check for the TB and the Malaria to start with.Hope this helps,mkh9",

            "answer": "Have you been anywhere that would increase your chances for contracting malaria? From what I understand you would be feeling so badly that you would most likely go to the hospital without any questions. One example... too weak to shower... if you are fine in the daytime I cannot imagine that it would be malaria.",
