            "answer": "Hi,Diabetes itself can predispose you to having skin fungal infections, and that is a common cause of itching. Other diseases that co-exist with diabetes, like liver dysfunction and some thyroid disease, can also cause itchiness/rash. If your doctor has checked your lab tests recently and all looked okay, I think\u00a0\u00a0trip\u00a0\u00a0to the dermatologist is your next best step.Good luck!",

I am not sure if my doctor just doesnt want to help or what..He is saying there is nothing I can do to help it..Could you please let me know if diabetes could be a cause of itching? Thank you for your help",
