            "answer": "Thank you so much for your help! You were very respectful,and I thank you. I have seen posts on here where people are responding in not quite so nice way for others to receive mental help, etc., and I knew that was not the answer I was looking for! I have one more concern- I am learning so much about HIV prevention on this site which is great, but do you know if his blood could have been on the tip of the lancet, and then contaminated my injection site when it was used on me? The fact that the lancet is not hollow certainly gave the lancet less surface area for the blood to accumulate, but blood can still cover the tip on the lancet. Should I be concerned about this? I know that he has many sexual partners and that was my reason for immediate concern. Thank you so so so much!",

    "question": "First off, I ask everyone please be respectful with comments and answers, I would really appreciate it! I had a friend who tested my blood sugar the other day using his diabetes testing kit. The problem is I am not 100% sure that he used a clean little poker thing to prink the side of my middle finger to squeeze out the blood. I would hope he did- but who knows if that happened... needless to say he pricked my finger and squeezed out a bit of blood to put in his meter and checked my sugars. I can be a little obsessive about my health- and I am working on that, but can HIV be transmitted in such a way? I may go to have some testing done in the future, maybe at 3, 6 and 12 months. Agh, I am losing sleep over this. Thank you in advance for your help! :)",
