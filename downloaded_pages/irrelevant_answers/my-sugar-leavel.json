            "answer": "With a fasting level of 168 mg/dl, this is high (about 9 mmol/l) and 114 mg/dl is 6.4 mmol/lA HBA1C blood test would show an average of your glucose levels in your body over a period of 3 months.The readings would put you as being a Type 2 diabetic.It is likely that your doctor will prescribe Metformin Slow Release (usually you start of on a low dose and this is adjusted if necessary) and also give you advice on your diet and exercise to control your diabetes.It is important not to miss or skip on meals.\u00a0\u00a0Eat complex carbs like brown bread\u00a0\u00a0and oats for example, which break down much slower in your body that the processed white foods.\u00a0\u00a0Cut out or cut down on cakes and sugary foods.\u00a0\u00a0It is also better to eat smaller quantities more often rather than have a large meal at one sitting.You need to be under the direction or your doctor and/or a diabetic nurse.",
