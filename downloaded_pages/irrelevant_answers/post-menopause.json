            "answer": "Hi.I would say you have got your spare tyre as you call it, due to hormonal changes.A seaweed wrap would take a couple off inches of the waist line but only temporarily, then it would go back to normal, as it is now.I have had a seaweed wrap many years ago, when i was younger, and took a couple of inches off my waistline, but it came back to normal within a couple of days.They are ok, for a special occassion, but once you start drinking and eating, it appears back to were you started.You feel good though after you have had one. An could be a good treat to yourself, but dont expect many miracles, and its only temporarily,Good luck, i would strongly suggest this is hormonal, and if your well you cant change it only to have liposuction. but then it may come back due to hormonal changes in your body.PS. Out of curiosity have you had your thyroid checked? simple blood testGood luckNicola",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!What you need to do is eliminate the common causes of increase in weight such as overeating or snacking, lack of exercise, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. Anemia, low proteins, adrenal gland problems, kidney and liver problems and Cushing Syndrome has to be eliminated. Late night snacking and poor sleep patterns too cause weight gain. Certain medications like antidepressants cause weight gain. Polycystic ovary too causes weight gain, hence has to be ruled out by an ultrasound of abdomen.If the above causes are eliminated then you can join a weight trainer and a nutrition expert and follow their advice and lose weight under their guidance.Take up yoga, deep breathing exercise, walking and remain strong and determined in your effort. Also the diet should contain more of green leafy vegetables, fruits and protein and less of spaghetti, potato etc.Hope this helps. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi...I am a 51 year old postmenopausal. I work out at the gym 3 times a week and up until 3 years ago I had a great figure. In the past few years I have developed what you would call a spare tire and no matter how many sit ups or work out at the gym I cannot get rid of it. I have been thinking of alternative liposuction procedures. Does anyone have any suggestions what works?....I also thought about getting a seaweed wrap..Anyone ever try one? and what has been the outcome?",
