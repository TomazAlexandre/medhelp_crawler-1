            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you feel there is a chance you could be pregnant, then repeat the test after your period date or go for a blood pregnancy test.Unintentional and unexplained weight loss is definitely not good. There are many causes like worms in stool, depression, anorexia nervosa, AIDS, cancers especially colon cancers, drug abuse, infections and loss of appetite. Loss of appetite can again be due to certain medications, drug abuse, depression, AIDS, acute and chronic infections, cancers and hypothyroidism. Either you do not eat well or there is increased metabolism as in hyperthyroid states, HIV, cancer etc. Poor absorption as in irritable bowel syndromes and malabsorption syndromes too is possible. Malabsorption syndromes are seen in intestinal tuberculosis, HIV, tropical sprue, parasites in stool and Whipple\u2019s Disease. Diabetes too can be the cause.The list is awesome and I do not want to scare you. But this I cannot examine you, I have listed all the possibilities.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
