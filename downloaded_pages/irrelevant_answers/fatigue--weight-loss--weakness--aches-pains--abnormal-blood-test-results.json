However your symptoms can be due to anemia, infection, fibromyalgia, arthritis and malignancy.Please follow the doctor advice and get the repeat blood count done.Meanwhile make sure you eat well ad get regular exercise and sleep.

    "question": "HiI'm a 32 year old male who has been suffering from fatigue, tiredness and weakness for several months (at least 3 or 4). Sometimes I sleep well and sometimes I don't but it doesn't seem to make any difference. I'm always very tired.I've also been steadily losing weight but I'm not dieting (I'm I wasn't overweight to start with - in fact I'm going to be underweight soon). I've lost 7 or 8 pounds in the last few months.I've been having weird aches & pains lately too. My bones & joints (knees and ankles) ache quite a lot, especially first thing in the morning.I've also been getting discomfort in my back on the left side (above my waist but below the rib cage I think - it comes and goes but is getting more and more noticable). I don't know what part of my body this is? (e.g. pancreas, kidney, spleen, something else)I get regular exercise (a brisk walk for an hour every day). I gave up alcohol and caffeine (not drank either for 3 months now). I eat a healthy low-fat diet with a good mix of carbs, protein, fibre and good fats. Plenty of fish and fruit/veg.I had blood tests done recently (a FBC - full blood count). It came back abnormal for neutrophils, red blood count and lymphocytes. Unfortunately I don't have the results and I don't know whether they were lower or higher than expected.I've just had a follow up (repeat) FBC 4 weeks after the first test. The results come back next week. I'm a bit worried.What could cause my symptoms and abnormal blood test results?What questions should I ask my doctor next week?Many thanks in advance.Jack",
