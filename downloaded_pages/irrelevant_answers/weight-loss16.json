            "answer": "I am on the same track you are. I am on synthroid and after 10 years still gain weight. I have done WW. My levels are \"normal\" and my doctor will not up the med's. I have been to a nutritionalist (\"eating great\"). Had the blood sugars checked (good) and cholesterol (good). Doctor says she doesn't know what to do with me. I once got very pro-active, walked 45 minutes a day for 3 months straight and lost only 2 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0How is this possible?\u00a0\u00a0I would be VERY interested in a professional, and/or someone that has successfully dealt with this issue to shed some insight and guidance.",

            "answer": "We hear from a lot of hypo patients with symptoms including low metabolism and difficulty with weight.\u00a0\u00a0Obviously diet and exercise play a big part , but if your thyroid hormone levels aren't right, then trying to lose weight and keep it off becomes very frustrating.Many times when doctors pronounce you as \"normal\", it really isn't true.\u00a0\u00a0If they have the \"Immaculate TSH Belief\" and only test and adjust your TSH levels, that doesn't work.\u00a0\u00a0TSH is a pituitary hormone that is affected by so many variables, including the time of day when blood is drawn, that TSH is inadequate as a diagnostic, by which to diagnose and dose a thyroid patient.\u00a0\u00a0At best TSH is an indicator, to be considered along with more important indicators, which are symptoms and also the levels of the actual, biologically active thyroid hormones, free T3 and free T4 ( not total T3 and total T4).\u00a0\u00a0Free T3 is four times as active as free T4 and FT3 correlates best with hypo symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0TSH correlates very poorly with hypo symptoms.So, your doctor needs to test for free T3 and free T4\u00a0\u00a0and even if these tests are within the low limit of their range that frequently will leave a patient with lingering hypo symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0That is because the ranges for the Frees are too broad, since they have never been adjusted, as was done for TSH over 7 years ago.So, in my opinion, the very best way to treat a thyroid patient is to test and adjust the levels of FT3 and FT4 with whatever type of meds are required to alleviate symptoms, without being constrained by resultant TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0Symptom relief should be all important.\u00a0\u00a0Frequently we hear from members that symptom relief required that FT3 was adjusted into the upper part of its range and FT4 was adjusted to at least the midpoint of its range.\u00a0\u00a0If your doctor does not agree with treating you in this manner, then you may have to find a good thyroid doctor.Here is a link that I think you will find very interesting.http://www.hormonerestoration.com/Thyroid.html",
