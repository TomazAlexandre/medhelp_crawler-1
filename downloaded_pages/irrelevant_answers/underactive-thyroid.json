            "answer": "What are your actual thyroid levels?\u00a0\u00a0Just because they are in the normal range, doesn't mean they are normal for you.\u00a0\u00a0If they are too low in the range, you will have symptoms, such as the ones you have.You should be getting tested for TSH, Free T3 and Free T4.\u00a0\u00a0Many doctors will only test TSH, thinking that it tells everything there is to know about thyroid function, when that couldn't be further from the truth.\u00a0\u00a0If your doctor refuses to test Free T3 and Free T4, which are actual thyroid hormones, you should find a different doctor.What tests did you actually have done?\u00a0\u00a0Have you been tested for Hashimoto's?I don't know that it's necessary to have your kids tested, at this point, if they have no symptoms, but I'd certainly keep an eye out for any type of possible autoimmune disease, since some in your family have RA, which is autoimmune.\u00a0\u00a0Do your mother and aunt have Hashimoto's?\u00a0\u00a0Hashimoto's is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the developed world.\u00a0\u00a0Hashimoto's is another autoimmune.Autoimmune diseases tend to run families, but not every member gets the same disease.\u00a0\u00a0For instance, in my family, I have Hashimoto's and Pernicious Anemia, my son has Type I diabetes and my daughter has Lupus.\u00a0\u00a0Those are all autoimmune.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, when a person has one autoimmune, chances of them getting another is greater.You should also look into insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0I have both.",

            "answer": "Thanks Barb, you have provided really useful info.I must admit it's been a little while since it was tested but if memory serves they only tested TSH and even then it was a mission getting them to agree a test at all. My level was right at the bottom of the normal range, right on the cusp but as it was still in the normal range they didn't proceed with any further investigation. I have recently moved house so need to register with a new doctor so I will definitely bring it up with them and have them test for all 3 three even if I have to pay for it. I have been tested for Diabetes a number of times and I am always fine - I am not worried about that side of things.Kind regards,Celeste",

    "question": "Hi,I had my thyroid tested and even though it was really low they still said it was within the normal range so aren't doing anything about it. Both myself, my dad and his mother have rheumatoid arthritis. My mom and her sister are both on thyroid meds for underproductive thyroid. Should I get tested again and push for meds. My kids are growing like weeds and they are thin but should I get them tested anyway?I am obsese and have been so since my mom put me on a 3 month birth control injection which stopped my periods. In the year I was on the injection my weight doubled and I have never been able to shift more than a couple kg's which has always come back. It is even harder now with the arthritis as my knees are stuffed and they are stuck at 70% with no straightening or bending. The surgeons are talking complete knee replacement in both knees.Any suggestions welcome :-)",
