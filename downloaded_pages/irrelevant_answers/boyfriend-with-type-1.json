            "answer": "irisheyesbee,WAK has given you great input / advice.My son who is 10 was diagnosed at the age of 3.\u00a0\u00a0He started on the insulin pump about 8 months ago and ONE of the reasons we opted for the pump is because he would have more flexibilty as far as how many carbohydrates he could have at one time as long as he adds them up and inputs them into his pump.Possibly your boyfriend's Hemoglobin A1C was not in a good range?\u00a0\u00a0I am unsure why he was scolded or possibly scolded.\u00a0\u00a0If his A1C is too high (hypothetically) then changes such as his basal rate(s) and / or insulin to carb ratio might need to be made..\u00a0\u00a0This is up to his Endocrinologist.I allow my son to eat what he wants (except for regular soda - unless low), however, we do our best to add up the carbs -sometimes it is hard to be completely accurate when eating out at a restaurant although we have a couple carb books.\u00a0\u00a0If your boyfriend does not have a carb book, he should get the Calorie King book.\u00a0\u00a0There is still guess work involved.\u00a0\u00a0We cannot always measure everything!either here (below) or ask his doc for one.http://www.calorieking.com/(I keep one in my purse - possibly he could put one in the glove compartment of his or your car and you could carry one in your purse for when you are out.)You sound VERY caring and supportive.\u00a0\u00a0I applaud you for that!Feel free to post again!SS",

            "answer": "I am a 23 year old diabetic who was diagnosed at age 4.\u00a0\u00a0From my personal experience and most of my friends who are diabetic as well, this is our opinion.\u00a0\u00a0At age 16-20, you know what you are doing (eating sugar, drinking, things like that) is making your life shorter.\u00a0\u00a0The idea behind this thinking is, i can live a shorter, happier life or a longer, miserable life.\u00a0\u00a0At that stage, I too chose to eat sugar and things like that.\u00a0\u00a0So did most of mu friends who are diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0No matter who i talked to and what they said, warned me of kidney failure, dialysis, blindness, amputation, seeing all these things happen to others, i still chose to live the shorter, happier life.\u00a0\u00a0Now that i am 23, i have just had my frist baby. Found out last week, he will be my only baby.\u00a0\u00a0The lifestyle i chose to live then has damaged my kidneys.\u00a0\u00a0If they had told me this 2 years ago, i would have bene upset, but not bothered me as much,but now that i have my son, things are so different.\u00a0\u00a0The dr told me i will be on dialysis in 5-10 years, 15 if i am lucky and all i can think about is...my son will only be 10 or 15.\u00a0\u00a0And that is if i do great care now.\u00a0\u00a0I try now, but it is easy to stray from what you are supposed to do. I have been on the pump for 3.5 years, by the way.\u00a0\u00a0And i still do sometimes cheat, i think everyone does at some point, whether its a coke or a piece of candy.\u00a0\u00a0Even giving your insulin first, letting it drop and then eating the candy can hurt you.\u00a0\u00a0I tried that too.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helped some.\u00a0\u00a0If he is anything like me, what you say or others say probably wont make any long term differences.\u00a0\u00a0He probably wants to live like other kids or teens and not feel different.\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck!!Christina",

            "answer": "My boyfriend is in the same shoes, except he doesn't use the pump.\u00a0\u00a0He was diagnosed with type 1 when he was 7 as well.\u00a0\u00a0He wasn't eating healthy and he never checked his sugar and he passed out from low blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I tried to learn all I could about diabetes and as I did so I realized that he was in danger from his diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It upset me, so I told him how I felt.\u00a0\u00a0I told him that I didn't want to be one of those old ladies that had to live 20-30 years without there husbands cause they died, and that I couldn't loose another family member young, cause I didn't think I could handle it.\u00a0\u00a0He realized how much it upset me that he didn't take care of himself, and he is now doing all he can to make things better.",

    "question": "My boyfriend is 18 years old.\u00a0\u00a0He has had type 1 diabetes since he was 7 years old, and about 4 years ago was given a pump to regulate his insulin.\u00a0\u00a0I'm concerned because he doesn't eat properly, and I think it's because he relies on the pump so he can eat things with high sugar.\u00a0\u00a0He'll eat all the cookies and sweets he wants and then just use the pump to bring his sugar down, which I think is kinda typical since he's a teenager (I am too, so I'm guilty as well).\u00a0\u00a0I went with him to an appointment and I got the impression that he was scolded by his doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Is what he's doing unhealthy?\u00a0\u00a0I'm nervous about approaching this topic with him because he doesn't like to talk about it, and I don't want to seem like I'm his mother.\u00a0\u00a0I have considered going on the diet with him to make it easier for him.\u00a0\u00a0How do you think I should approach this with him?",
