            "answer": "Hi,Have you talked to your doctor and found relief for the terrible itching? i had Autoimmune Hepatitis for many years and had to endure a lot of itching, all day, everyday, I was going crazy with it, it was relentless. I tried many things to try and relieve it but nothing helped until my hepatologist prescribed oral capsules called Rifampin ( it was my salvation!! ) Within a week or two it was gone and I slowly took less and less and dropped it completely. Nothing ever worked so effectively! I hope you are feeling better.Take care,Sharon",
