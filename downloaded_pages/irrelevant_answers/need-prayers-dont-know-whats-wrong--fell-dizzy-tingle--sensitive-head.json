            "answer": "thanks for your reply, with no insurance i sat in hospital waiting room for 9 hours before seeing a doctor and my friends asked why i waited so long before going...i was hoping i'd get better, i wanted to avoid that long wait.they ran ekg, blood work, urine work, ct scans, etc....everything came out good....except...high amount of sodium in urine.\u00a0\u00a0he believes its some rare disease that some get after hitting their heads.\u00a0\u00a0I googled sodium in urine and diabetes came up.\u00a0\u00a0He says he doesn't think diabetes, my blood sugar wouldn't have looked that good, nothing in any of the test points at diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0But, all the signs i had come up in diabetes and diabetes runs in my family.\u00a0\u00a0Then me drinking that fruit punch soda hours before my fall.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I go back in a couple days and they'll run more test on my urine.",

            "answer": "Well I will pray for you for sure.\u00a0\u00a0You do have an awful lot going on here.\u00a0\u00a0Because you don't have the money for the proper dosage of medication you are self medicating and that may be part of the issue.\u00a0\u00a0Your body has to be at a constant dosage of both medications to get the full benefits.\u00a0\u00a0It could also be that your body thinks it's going through withdrawal because the proper dosage isn't being met.From the description is really does sound like diabetes doesn't it?\u00a0\u00a0But that blood work came out okay.\u00a0\u00a0I'm glad you took the step to go into the hospital even though you can't afford it, you really need the work up.\u00a0\u00a0Please make sure you keep the follow up appt. with them it is so important.Many hospitals have a foundation that is available for folks who don't have insurance or insurance that won't cover some bills.\u00a0\u00a0You should look into this with the hospital that you owe money to so that you take advantage of a program like this.\u00a0\u00a0In many cases they can pay for a good portion of your bill and then the hospital will work with you on the remainder so that you can pay a little a month.\u00a0\u00a0I know you don't have a job right now but when you do get one.I know it must seem like you are in an uphill battle but try to chip away at both the hospital bill and your medical condition.\u00a0\u00a0By not taking action it seems like the problems just keep compounding but by taking a little steps at a time and acting you will make progress.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you and keep us all posted.",

    "question": "So i've been in bed for the last 2 days and have had some time to think of several weird things that occurred prior to my big fall, 2 days ago.\u00a0\u00a0i apology for not proof-reading, not feeling well.Strangely, 2 days ago i suddenly woke up at 2am and had to use to the bathroom.\u00a0\u00a0I say strangely because i use the restroom before going to sleep and its so since i just went to sleep 3 hours earlier that i suddenly woke up from a deep sleep and immediately rushed to the bathroom.\u00a0\u00a0I remember while taking a tinkle i felt very dizzy.\u00a0\u00a0I remember telling myself to hurry up (hurry up tinkling because i was very dizzy) next thing you know i heard a very loud pound and i'm getting up off my bathroom floor.\u00a0\u00a0It appears since my head was a bump and i fell to the right, the only thing my head could've hit would've been my chrome door knob.So I stumble to back to my bed, then I get on my knees to pray, then I went to get me some orange juice.To make a long story short, I lay in bed for the next 7 or 8 hours before I could go to sleep. I wake up, go to bathroom, feeling slightly dizzy but nothing like when I fell.\u00a0\u00a0I heat up some food and lay in my bed and ate.\u00a0\u00a0To bypass so much, I ended up laying in bed for the next 16 hours, eating on 7 different times (i don't usually eat like this, and it seems to never fill me up for long). Anyhow I seem to be urinating more frequent.These are the weird things that i had noticed 2 days before the bathroom fall.i woke up weds morning after 9 hours of sleep and couldn't stop stretching.\u00a0\u00a0My left and right arms felt so fatigue'd, i must have stretched for over an hour with no luck.\u00a0\u00a0I stayed in shower for hour just letting the warm water try to massage my shoulders.\u00a0\u00a0I must have drunk, 5 cups of apple juice and water because i felt somewhat dehydrated.Anyways after a couple hours i felt better, went to the grocery store, came back home ate, talked on phone, etc..While in my chair on computer looking for a job, I noticed my wrists tingling, i lifted and it felt weak.\u00a0\u00a0But, the tingle went a way pretty quick.\u00a0\u00a0Then while drinking some orange juice i noticed a horrible smell...i thought it was coming from my apartment i opened the window, but it seems it may have been coming from my breath.Really feeling drowsy but needing to be up and focused to find a job, i took a 20mg adderall.\u00a0\u00a0 I stayed up for another few hours, then ate some chicken paddies before going to bed.\u00a0\u00a0I hadn't drunk a soda in months, soda had been making me sleepy.\u00a0\u00a0But, I couldn't resist getting soda this day.\u00a0\u00a0Besides if i drink before bed, i'll just sleep better!This leads me to the big fall, i suddenly woke up, put on my house shoes and noticed my right foot had the same tingling my left foot had earlier that day.\u00a0\u00a0But, it appeared a little sharper, sort of like a mild cramp and somebody was shocking me.\u00a0\u00a0It continued as I used the restroom and i haven't felt it since i got from my fall.The only other unusual things I can think of is....maybe a week ago, while scratching my head, I noticed my head was super sensitive in certain spots.\u00a0\u00a0There doesn't appear to me any lumps or cuts, but i rub my head in certain spots and it feels like there some kind of damage under my hair and skin.\u00a0\u00a0It still feels like that right now.\u00a0\u00a02 days after my fall the only strange things i can notice is my sensitive head, mild to dizzyness, and stiff feelings in my upperbody...but maybe that's from being in bed for 2 days straight.i'm 32, male, moderate alcohol use, the only drugs i'm prescribed ritalin 10mg but adderall has always done wonders for me.\u00a0\u00a0So I have purchased on my own.\u00a0\u00a0Since my money has been low, i've been doing 20 to 35mg adderall a day.\u00a0\u00a0I knew i didn't have money for anymore, so I begain substituting with ritalin.\u00a0\u00a0 The morning before my fall i took 20mg ritalin, 10 hours later i took 20mg adderall.\u00a0\u00a0When I was working 14 hours a day, I had taken way more of the 2 so I don't think the amount I took on this day was a lot and I hadn't mixed the 2 in 3 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0And hadn't took an abusive dose, i only took 20mg ritalin that morning because i felt so drowsy after more than 8 hours sleep.\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless I hope I never have to take adderall or ritalin again.Anyone have any clue on what is going on with me?\u00a0\u00a0I have no insurance, already owe the hospital thousands after a car accident, currently unemployed, i've been thinking about all my bills in bed, getting very depressed.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your prayers and help.",
