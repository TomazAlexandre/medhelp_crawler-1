You got operated and the fracture has been reduced with the help of k-wires.2) I would suggest you to maintain proper blood sugar values with anti diabetic medications and insulin whatever is prescribed to you.3) the most important thing you have to follow is to eat healthy and to avoid infections for a faster healing.4) Follow up with your orthopedician for recent scans to know about the recovery and also to avoid complete exertion and weight bearing till suggested.Take care!",

            "answer": "Thanks to Dr. Vinod for helping.The 3 kwires have been removed, cast done with and have started OT 2x a week. 6 weeks after surgery, however, I can bend my right pinky at dip, & pip very easily but bending it at mcp (the knuckle that joins at palm) is very tough. While making a fist the pinky stays about an inch away from touching the palm. Also, the 4th (ring finger's) knuckle seems to be sunk. What is preventing the folding of 5 mcp at the palm? If it is scarring can it be teased out by injection or will it just be flexible enough after 3-4 months of OT and exercising ?",

    "question": "hi, 46 yr old male here with controlled diabetes and controlled hypertension with medications. about 3 wks back i was fooling around with my teenage son doing boxing gestures and i accidentally hit my right hand hard on the corner of two walls. instantly, my hand swelled up and my son and my wife for life earned the right to call me \"still immature\". anyways, i got operated on 12 hours later. had 3 k-wires inserted in my right smal finger, got a hard cast and was released the other day. The surgeon called the fracture comminuted and just yesterday i was given a plastic cast and was asked to use the fingers every 1 hour or so.My question, how well will my right hand recover, will i have any defects or will pain remain when i light heavier objects?I am a very right handed person and am on computer for 8-9 hrs every day for living.",
