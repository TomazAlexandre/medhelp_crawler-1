            "answer": "You seem to have some concerns here that really should be addressed by your doctor(s). I'm not familiar with Colyte, but I am with another prep called \"Fleets phosphosoda\" which you drink the night before your test to clean out your system. Whatever the prep, if you take it gradually - at your own pace - I would think you'd do alright. It shouldn't make you vomit, but is intended to give you diarrhea to thoroughly flush you out. Your blood pressure and blood sugar are issues you definitely should make your doctors aware of. Obviously you're not the first person with these conditions to ever have a colonoscopy, so they must have a protocol for such cases. Just make sure they're prepared to follow it. Good luck.",

            "answer": "talk to the doc.\u00a0\u00a0Fleets Phosphasoda is less to drink, but still has the same effect.\u00a0\u00a0the key is to keep yourself hydrated during the prep.\u00a0\u00a0lots and lots of water and sports drinks.\u00a0\u00a02 days of clear liquids will give your body time to naturally clear you out pretty good and then you only need a little bit of prep.\u00a0\u00a0mag citrate is also an alternative.\u00a0\u00a0there are also pills called Visacol that are used to cleanse the bowel.\u00a0\u00a0it's a lot of pills and a lot of water that you have to drink.\u00a0\u00a0so definitely talk to your doc",

            "answer": "you need to address all your concern to your doctor. that is very important given your condition with type I diabetes. By the way I did that gallon thing and I did good. Even though you clean your intestine, you still are hydrated. In my case, I didn't vomit or got any reaction at all.\u00a0\u00a0I had my colonoscopy done next day at 7AM and left the place without eating anything. I didn't want to eat any bread, anything with milk, or anything with preservative so I went straight to home and prepare my natural food. I couldn't believe myself. I thought before the test that I will die if I didn't eat food. I did fine.",

I remember nothing at all about the procedure and felt fine when I woke up.\u00a0\u00a0And they gave me juice and toast in recovery.Oh, and buy baby wipes and desitin or cortisone cream to use the evening before.\u00a0\u00a0It will lessen the irritation.\u00a0\u00a0Use the baby wipes GENTLY instead of toilet paper.",

    "question": "I am 43 years old with sudden bowel changes. Started with cramping and diarrhea on and off for 11/2 days. Then did not have any bowel movement for over 2 weeks (no bloating or gas)\u00a0\u00a0some cramping, back paid, nauseous, tired and now weight loss. No visible sign of blood when I had the diarrhea. Had abdominal surgeries 2x for adhesions, 1998\u00a0\u00a0c-section,\u00a0\u00a0due to complications,\u00a0\u00a0back to surgery due to excessive bleeding, had to have partial hysterectomy, 3rd surgery to stop more bleeding. I form adhesions easily. Scheduled for a colonoscopy, concerned about the prep (Colyte), have to drink 4 liters of\u00a0\u00a0prep. Have heard unpleasant things about prep. I am a Type 1 diabetic on\u00a0\u00a0insulin pump,\u00a0\u00a02000 was diagnosed with Cardiomyopathy, taking Diovan, Lanoxin, 18 mg Coreg,\u00a0\u00a0very concerned I will have problems when I start prep, very weak stomach, most likely will not be able to finish the prep, Is this dangerous with other health problems and is there another way to clean yourself out without this harsh prep.\u00a0\u00a0 A few weeks ago I had a blood pressure of 60/56 could barely function, had to go to ER, came to conclusion, that I did have a high blood sugar through the night and due to the urinating through the night, caused me to be low on body fluids and due to taking the coreg I had the very low blood pressure and irregular heart beat. Concerned due to the vomiting and the diarrhea it causes, I will experience complications. Please let me know if you would prescribe this to a patient with diabetes and heart problems.Patty",
