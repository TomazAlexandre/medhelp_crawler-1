Its good for us going through similar compilations to be able to relate to one another. Wish more moms 35 and older would post on here.",

I agree that the \"Am I Pregnant\" posts are EXTREMELY aggrivating, but there are those if us in the younger age group that have questions the other young moms can't answer. There are also young moms that find it difficult wading through the posts trying to find the ones that are truly helpful. There are still more (like myself) that simply can't put up with the drama and inability to utilize proper grammar and spelling that you find so often in the younger forums. I'm sorry if us younger moms aren't of the proper age to supposed to post in this particular forum, but we aren't all bad. We aren't all 'too stupid' to realize the forums are set up by age and not pregnancy week. We aren't all posting or reading in this forum just to be annoying.",
