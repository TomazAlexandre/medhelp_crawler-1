            "answer": "Just to add, because I'm sure some people will argue this point. I will never forget a time when I was in hospital, a cardiologist said to a patient \"This is your body giving up because you mistreated it with smoking\". The patient explained he had never smoked and the cardiologist could not give an explanation. He was normal weight, ate healthily, had a physically active job and yet he had heart disease. His cholesterol was also lower than average. Personally I think 'inherited genetically' is a cop out. How is artery disease increasing so rapidly across the planet? does this mean all our genes have gone bad?",

However, the cardiologist rightly feels that the dilation will reduce over time, and he has trivial pericardial effusion which is to be expected after major surgery. The shunt between the atria is looking great (closed) and so I would say his prognosis is pretty good.",

            "answer": "Atrial Fibrillation is often associated with an enlarged atrium, usually the left atrium is the source of the problem.I am almost a quarter century older than your father so my experience is for a heart of considerable more age.I had a leaky Mitral valve from my 50s and likely undiagnosed before that.\u00a0\u00a0I began to suffer from AFib when in my early 50s, I had quit smoking 5 years+ before that and had taken on a \"healthy heart\" life style including running for cardiovascular health. I was treated to stop the AFib and it mostly worked.\u00a0\u00a0See my profile.At age 67 I had open heart surgery because the leaky Mitral valve had resulted in unacceptable enlargement in my left Atrium.\u00a0\u00a0My MV was repaired and the surgeon said (even at my age, my words) my Atrium could (or did he say would?) shrink back toward normal size.\u00a0\u00a0Now 7 years later I can say the only good news I have is the MV repair is still working (I still have my own valve, just a ring was inserted in the opening), and my Atrium is no longer getting larger.\u00a0\u00a0The bad news is my Atrium is not shrinking back.There is more detail in my profile.My botton lines:\u00a0\u00a0Stop smoking, it can be done and I haven't smoked for over 25 years and think that is one contributor to the fact I am still alive. And, my experience is at an age older than your father's my Atrium did not shrink following valve repair.\u00a0\u00a0Atria Fibrillation is my guess, please it is only a guess, as to the source of your father's irregular heart beat.I have lived with AFib for 7 years now, and at my age it only slightly limits my physical activity. of course I no longer run or even hike up steep hills but I get around fine and should exercise more.Hope for improvement for all in 2014",
