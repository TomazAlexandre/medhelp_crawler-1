I guess you could say am I on sort of a fishing expedition.\u00a0\u00a0I have cholinergic urticaria and am losing hair by the handful since November.\u00a0\u00a0Trouble sleeping, tired all the time. Thyroid problems run in my family and I figured I would start with someone who would look at more than just t3, t4, free t4. That's all my PCP will do.",
