And my first baby was an average 7 lbs and didn't have high glucose levels after birth. I think they do exaggerate it a bit too much...so long as your sensible it's nothing to loose sleep over. I had natural v.birth so aiming for another one this time too. Good luck. X",

I find out in a few days if I have it but I just wanted to make sure it can be controlled as it is still early.",

            "answer": "Ive had gd with all my pregnancies and was able to easily control my levels with a controlled diet. It means saying goodbye to all those yummy carbs and sweets but it is doable. When you have gd and your levels are to high that extra glucose goes to the baby and their body has to work harder to get rid of it. It does make for bigger babies and there are other health risks involved if you don't control your glucose.\u00a0\u00a0But as long as you listen carefully to your drs there's no reason to stress yourself!",

            "answer": "I've got GD, I'm on daily medication because it wasn't able to be controlled with strict diet changes alone and I check my sugars four times daily (thankfully the medication has been enough so far and I haven't needed to start on insulin). I've had to start on non stress tests at every appointment and have to get extra ultrasounds to check and make sure my placenta is still functioning efficiently. My midwife told me today they might not be able to let me wait until labor starts naturally if I go overdue, that induction might be necessary. She told me I have an increased risk of having a \"sudden stillborn\" birth from the diabetes. Also that in some cases if the placenta stops functioning properly and baby isn't delivered soon enough that brain damage can result from a lack of oxygen. Lung development may be delayed.There are lots of potential complications. Many women don't end up having trouble but it really is a serious diagnosis and requires close monitoring. Even just having a \"big baby\" carries risks of its own.I'm not trying to scare you. But it's not as easy as just \"follow orders\" and \"be sensible\". Even women who strictly adhere to diet and medication orders can end up with complications. It's less likely obviously if it's well controlled. But it doesn't just happen to noncompliant patients. It's just one of those things that you do the best you can, and hope for the best. The chances of a healthy baby are still really good. Catching it early and starting treatment right away is key.Good luck.",
