            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include dietary causes, GI infections/ inflammations, GI motility issues, non-GI causes such as hormonal/ endocrine issues, renal issues etc. The symptoms are unlikely to be related to the endoscopy. I would suggest getting this evaluated by a primary physician initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "I am quite frustrated. I went in for a upper endoscopy 3 weeks ago, I felt fine but doc was looking for source of my low iron.\u00a0\u00a0Test and biopsy showed nothing.\u00a0\u00a0I have a small hiatal hernia and some gallstones which I have known about for 5 years and they never gave me problems.\u00a0\u00a02 days after the procedure I started with very uncomfortable bloating.\u00a0\u00a0The kind where even tho I have lost a few pounds nothing fits - bloating is high , not in the lower digestive tract.\u00a0\u00a0So far my doctor prescribed antibiotics, and a pain reliever/muscle relaxant designed for the stomach area.\u00a0\u00a0I think it helps with the pain but not the bloating.\u00a0\u00a0Now he wants to do a colonscopy the end of the month.\u00a0\u00a0(I had one done 14 months ago). I am on a gluten free diet and have been for almost a year now so I know it is not carbs. I don't eat the junk gluten free stuff (ie cookies, cake etc)Any suggestions as why this happened now?\u00a0\u00a0Is it a coinsidence that it occured after the endoscopy.\u00a0\u00a0Having a pity party for myself, I have worked so hard to eat and excercise to control my sugar (diabetes rampant in my family) and have succeeded on many levels.I am considering trying to fast for a few days. If anyone has any ideas please post.",
