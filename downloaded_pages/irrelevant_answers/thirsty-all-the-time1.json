            "answer": "4 pints is sufficient. Its the recommended 8, 8 ounce glasses per day but since your pregnant now, try drinking a little bit more. Its pretty normal to be really thirsty though this early in pregnancy. I was also with every pregnancy. My throat always seemed super dry. It stopped around 2nd trimester though. If ur concerned talk to ur OB.",
