            "answer": "Hi Jon,I am glad that you stated that you don't expect me to be able to tell you if you have type 1 diabetes or not, and you are absolutely correct!\u00a0\u00a0You also state that you have not had blood work done in 18 months and that you have had extreme physical changes in that 18 month time period.\u00a0\u00a0You don't state whether or not you have been to see your physician regarding the symptoms that you are having, and that is very important information.\u00a0\u00a0Your physician is the only one who can determine the cause of these distressing symptoms. Type 1 diabetes has many symptoms associated with it, but they can also be symptoms of other diseases too.\u00a0\u00a0Extreme thirst and frequent urination are classic symptoms of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0As far as what is classified as frequent urination, I will share my experience as a mom who's daughter was 21 months old when she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I would put my daughter to bed at 8pm and by 11pm when I went to bed, she would have wet through her diaper, had soaking wet pajamas and her bed sheet would be thoroughly wet also.\u00a0\u00a0My advise to you Jon, is to make an appointment with your family physician and begin there. I wish you the best in finding some answers.",

            "answer": "BeforeI\u00a0\u00a0was diagnosed with diabetes the frequent urination progressivly got worse as time went on It was once a night and then it was 6-10 times a night and that was when my parents knew there was a problem.\u00a0\u00a0When there 11 yr old was wetting the bed.Now this is just my experience!Like JDRf Team gg said talk to your doc as soon as possible and see what he says about your new symptoms and also let them no that you have gained some weight because that could factor in to his decision of what his course of action would be.Hope this helpsPumpgirl03",

            "answer": "I first had fuzzy (then gradually blurred) vision and splitting headaches for the better part of a year before I got a thirst that could not be quenched.\u00a0\u00a0Shortly after I started drinking what seemed to be gallons of water, mouth dried up like cotton to the point I didn't even have enough saliva and then came the constant run to the bathroom.\u00a0\u00a0Then the rest of the classic symptoms kicked in rapidly and I got hospitalized with sugars way over the 600 mark.",

    "question": "Hi everyone.At the moment, I have no idea if I have diabetes, and I sure don't expect someone to be able to tell me yes or no, but just some advice would be nice if at all possible.I have had undiagnosed health problems for 5 years now (I am 25 now), and this includes dizziness, fuzzy eyesight, headaches, and so on. Now, I have had 10+ blood and sugar tests over the last 5 years and it has not found anything, so I guess I could rule out diabetes UP TO my last blood test, which was 18 months ago.I am now obese in size (probably due to me eating too much), and I wasn't 18 months ago, and I have a new symptom of dry throat and mouth. Everytime I wake up my mouth and lips and throat are bone dry, so much so I can't move my mouth for a while until I take a sip of water. This has happened every night for the last 2 weeks. Also during the day I have a dry throat and a lack of saliva, although no where near as bad as at night. Also my dizziness has gotten worse, but then, I have always had dizziness since my health problems began, so I am never sure if it is due to my ongoing undiagnosed problems or whether it is due to new ones I have picked up, very confusing. So when people ask me if I have accompanying symptoms, of course I say yes, but then I had many of them before blood/sugar tests too.Does the dry mouth and throat sound anything like diabetes ? It happens no matter what room I sleep in. Also what would be classed as frequent urinating ? I can sleep the night ok.Thanks lots for any help or advice, sorry for the bemusing situation !!Jon",
