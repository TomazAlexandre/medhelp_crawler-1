            "answer": "I am sorry that I cannot personally recommend any particular brand of seamless sock, but your doctor's advice to try seamless socks makes good sense. I did a Google search on \"seamless socks\" and a LOT of brands pop up. I wouldn't worry too much about the brand... socks are not expensive, and in your case the only real quality you are seeking is seamlessness. You probably can order any brand and be happy.Has any of our Forum readers tried any specific brands? Does anyone have a suggestion for Ashleye? Feel free to post here.",
