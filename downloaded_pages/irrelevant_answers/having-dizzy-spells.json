    "question": "3 years ago I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on .150 Synthroid for the past year and a half.\u00a0\u00a0a few weeks ago all my symptoms started to return.\u00a0\u00a0Dry skin, tired, constipated, etc...\u00a0\u00a0I had my Doc run a thyroid pannel to see if it was my meds. The results came back that I had to much Thyroid hormone but my body was saying I didn't have enough.\u00a0\u00a0So my Doc perscribed me a lower dose of Synthrtoid and .5mcg of Cytomel. I have been on this combo for a little over a week now.\u00a0\u00a02 nights ago I started to get dizzy while I was sleeping.\u00a0\u00a0Every time I roled over I would feel llike I was spinning.\u00a0\u00a0The fallowing morning I got up took a shower and started getting dizzy again. this time it was so bad I became cold and clammy and laying and had to lay down.\u00a0\u00a0After about 3.5 hours I was able to get up however I was feeling a little shakey almost like I was dehydrated but I was drinking plenty of water.\u00a0\u00a0By the evening I was feeling better again.\u00a0\u00a0Last night it all started happening again.\u00a0\u00a0The only difference was the intensity was not as bad.Could the Cytomel be causing these symptoms or could there be something else going on?",
