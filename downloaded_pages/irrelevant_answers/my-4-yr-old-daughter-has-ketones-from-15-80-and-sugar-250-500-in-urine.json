            "answer": "HELLO, I ALSO HAVE A 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO WE FOUND OUT ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO HAS TYPE 1 JUVENILE DIABETES. WE FOUND OUT PRETTY MUCH THE SAME WAY AS YOU, FREQUENT URINATION AND BED WETTING. I TOOK HER TO THE DOCTOR AND THEY DID A URINALISIS ON HER AND SAID SHE HAD SUGAR IN HER URINE. THEY TOLD US TO TAKE HER STRAIGHT TO THE ER AND THEY CHECKED HER SUGAR IT WAS 489. THEY ALSO CHECKED FOR KETONES AND FOUND NONE. BUT THEY DID PUT HER IN THE HOSPITAL FOR 2 DAYS UNTIL THEY GOT HER SUGAR UNDER CONTROL AND STARTED HER ON INSULIN SHOTS IMMEDIATELY. YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY SEEK ANOTHER OPINION ASAP. MODERATE TO LARGE AMOUNTS OF KETONES ARE A WARNING SIGN TO POSSIBLE DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS. PLEASE IF YOUHAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAT I COULD POSSIBLY ANSWER LET ME KNOW.",

            "answer": "Hello, Mary.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Ketones and sugar in urine are a sign of problems with blood sugars 3 to 4 hours earlier.\u00a0\u00a0It that that long for the kidneys to process everything and get it out of your system.\u00a0\u00a0Ketones typically don't go away on their own unless they were caused by extreme dehydration or other illness.\u00a0\u00a0It is possible for a healthy person to develop ketones, but not common.\u00a0\u00a0Has she been ill at all?I would request to do a fasting glucose test, which will give you a more accurate picture of blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

            "answer": "Hi, Im no professional either.. just a 17 yr old boy who found out about the same way.. in 2000 i was ten..and had never wet the bed. Then one night i woke up and told my mom that i had wet the bed and she thought it odd. the next couple days she had me eating and drinking pedialite. 2 days later she could see my collar bones, shoulders and rib cage. she took me to the Dr. they took a BG check. the lady comes back and sais you need to take him to the ER. same as the person above i was in for two days and put on insulin shots. Diagnosed with Type 1 juvenille onset diabetes.if your daughter is diagnosed \"i pray she doesnt\" ask them if she is in the \"honeymoon\" stage. They told me that if i took REALLY REALLY good care of my diabetes there was a tiny chance it might go away.p.s I teared up when i started reading your post cause its so close to mine and its a hard thing to overcome and its a sad thing for any family to have to go through specially so young. im almost 18 .jan/ 12/ 1990",

    "question": "My daughter is 4 yrs old, we had a routine dr. visit today and I asked them to test her for diabetes, the only symptom I noticed was that she started wetting the bed at night and she has NEVER done that.\u00a0\u00a0The Dr. did the urine test and came back and said she was positive for ketones and sugar, she sent me to the local ER there they did a full blood work up but all test were normal, this stumped the DR. and the on-call endrocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0So the ER repeated the urine test that her DR did and sure enough it came back with ketones and sugar but lower levels.\u00a0\u00a0They sent us home basically with no answers and I am worried sick, has anybody ever heard of this before?\u00a0\u00a0They also took a look at her liver and said all the test came back normal. I would really appreciate ANY feedback.\u00a0\u00a0I thank you in advance.",
