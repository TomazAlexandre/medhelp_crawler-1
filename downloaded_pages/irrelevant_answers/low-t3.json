            "answer": "I'm new to Hash's but I think you should have the thyriod ultrasound at least.I had trouble shallowing for several, several years and my doctor told me it was from acid reflux.Endo did an ultrasound after a referral, finding that my primary doctor was under treating my thyroid. I hadn't had one in 6 years. The new ultrasound showed that I had a goiter, scar tissue and cysts.",

            "answer": "The range on FT4 is often about 0.8-1.8.\u00a0\u00a0If that's the case with your lab, then you are right at the top of the range.\u00a0\u00a0FT3 does look low, and Armour (dessicated) would improve your FT3 level and the balance between FT3/FT4.\u00a0\u00a0You should do some research on dessicated since the formulas of both Armour and NatureThroid were changed last year, and many of our members find they do not work as well for them as they used to.\u00a0\u00a0Many have started taking ERFA from Canada, which they find a better alternative at this point. Check the archives.You should also work on getting your vitamin D up.An ultrasound is pretty standard testing with Hashi's.\u00a0\u00a0I agree that you ought to have a U/S to check for nodules, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Hoarseness, fullness in the throat and difficulty swallowing are all associated with Hashi's (nodules, goiter, etc.).The enzyme (5' deiodinase) that is responsible for converting T4 to T3 is a selenium-based enzyme.\u00a0\u00a0So, if you are deficient in selenium, conversion could be impeded.\u00a0\u00a0If you are deficient, I don't see where correcting a deficiency is going to cause diabetes.I think you should proceed with U/S and selenium testing.\u00a0\u00a0If selenium checks out fine, then give dessicated a shot. You're very lucky your doctor is paying attention to FT3 as many of them want to ignore it.",

            "answer": "Thank you for all the information and suggestions.\u00a0\u00a0I will find someone to order the ultrasound and will try the Armour.\u00a0\u00a0It is good information that there are alternatives in Canada that might work better if the Armour doesn't work satisfactorily.\u00a0\u00a0I will check the archives to see what is there.Also plan to ask for a selenium check.\u00a0\u00a0I think this particular doctor is cautious in prescribing certain supplements due to possible side effects.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering if those on this forum think an endocrinologist would be more at ease with the ultrasound and the selenium.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't seen one and wasn't sure there was a need as yet.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps I need to rethink that.\u00a0\u00a0How does one decide when to see one? Aren't they for more complicated cases?",

            "answer": "Just be aware that having the Endo after their name does not guarantee a good thyroid doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Many specialize in diabetes, not thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Many have the \"Immaculate TSH Belief\", and do not want to test for FT3, and sometimes even FT4.\u00a0\u00a0Many also are still using the old range of TSH, and have no idea about the need to reduce the ranges for FT3 and FT4, or at least use the current ranges as only guidelines within which to adjust levels as necessary to relieve symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Probably even fewer want to treat a patient for symptoms, relying instead on blood test results, as I discussed above.AS long as your doctor is willing to test for FT3 and FT4, and consider using a med other than a T4 type, then I think you would be best served staying with that doctor, as long as willing to treat your symptoms, rather than going by blood test levels only.\u00a0\u00a0JMHO",

            "answer": "It is good to know the biases of some endos.\u00a0\u00a0Will keep that filed away then in case I need to interview one.\u00a0\u00a0I see two listed in an adjacent area and one claims their special interest is thyroid, the other claims thyroid and adrenal.I am very aware that not every doctor is a good fit.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes they can only go along with you on a journey so far before their own insecurities or biases get in the way of your tx. I think on first meeting a lot can be determined if the right questions are asked.That said I do think you are right about the current doctor.\u00a0\u00a0 He definitely is willing to think outside the box.\u00a0\u00a0I just hope he is willing to step outside his comfort zone andconsider selenium if needed.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering if anyone on the forum has used selenium, if so in what context and if they had any rise in blood sugar.Thanks for your response!\u00a0\u00a0Good points.\u00a0\u00a0Marie",

    "question": "I have been on synthroid for over 4 decades and was dx with Hashimoto's.\u00a0\u00a0Two years ago the dose was lowered to .125 mg.My latest thyroid tests showed antibodies..TSH .45Free T4 1.8Free T3 2.0My doctor wants to put me on Armour.\u00a0\u00a0He will not consider selinium because he is concerned it will cause diabetes.My vitamen D showed low as well.I have had\u00a0\u00a0a recent dx of pure autonomic failure.\u00a0\u00a0I have arthritis and gout.\u00a0\u00a0I have dry skin, thinning eyebrows, and difficulty swallowing and a feeling of fullness in my throat.Sometimes I have stridor asnf my voice gets hoarse.My doctor does not want to do a thyroid ultrasound as he thinks the swallowing might be neurological.\u00a0\u00a0I wonder if I may have thyroid nodules and I also wonder if my T3 is low due to low selenium levels.\u00a0\u00a0Selenium has not been tested.Not sure how to proceed.",
