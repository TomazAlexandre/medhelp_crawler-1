            "answer": "Hi, Thank you very much for your question. Usually cause of RLS is unknown, but it is essential that you consult your treating doctor before decreasing or stopping the recommended dose. Other reasons of RLS could be rheumatoid arthritis, kidney failure, diabetes or any underlying heart disorder. The leg pain of RLS typically eases with movement of the legs and becomes more evident at rest. Therefore, medicine dosage is usually prescribed before going to bed. Though there is no permanent cure of RLS, it is advisable that you take regular & sound sleep to get relief from your symptoms. Supplements of iron or vitamin deficiency certainly help in elderly patients with RLS to ease out symptoms. Other medications such as levodopa, bromocriptine, oxycodone may be tried to provide some relive in your symptoms. If your previous medicines are causing RLS, then they can be stopped or reducing the doses after consulting your treating doctor may help to control symptoms. Hope this information proves helpful to you. Take Care & Regards!!!",

    "question": "I am an active 20 year old. I have been playing sports and on the move since I was 2 years old. For the most part I did not take care of my joints in my younger years. I am now seeing the fall of that. But I have had some problems with my leg. I have had pain and numbness in my lower back and right hip. I was diagnosed by a MD that I have restless leg syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0Any medicine that I have tried has only made it worse and have really made my sleeping horrible. I have had these problems for the last 3 or 4 years. At first it was only when I slept on anything other than a bed (couch, floor, cot, etc.) and then after a few nights it would subside. Then about a couple of months ago I slept on a couch, then it hasn't gone away. That was when I went to the doctor, and nothing can help. I have read in multiple places and some trusted nurses have told me that pinched nerves do go away after a while, but I assumed a few years would be longer than \"a while\". I haven't had a good night's sleep in a long time. Anything I can do? And anything I can do each night to ease the pain and unease feeling? I really need sleep!Thanks!",
