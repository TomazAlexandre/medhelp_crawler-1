            "answer": "He has moderate aortic stenosis which means he needs medical therapy but no surgery yet. Also the ascending aorta is within normal limits, so this does not need surgical intervention. How severe is the aortic regurgitation: if it is severe than he may need valve replacement, but it does not sound like it from the LV dimensionsHis EF of 48%is low however, without any good explanation. His stress test was likely non diagnostic because of insufficient heart rates. But he may still benefit from a left heart catheterization because of his diminished ejection fraction and diabetes and age.Does he have atrial fibrillation? With the enlarged left atrial size he is at risk for this, and if not rate controlled this condition can cause a cardiomyopathy.",

Sees an internist regularly. In past few months, BS's have been increasing and I believe he will be starting oral meds at next visit this week. How significant is \"considerable\" aortic cusp and root calcification. I know the root dimensions are WNL but does the calcification have any implications? Should Echo be repeated annually? Should my daughter and son be screened for BAV? Thanks so much for your time.",
