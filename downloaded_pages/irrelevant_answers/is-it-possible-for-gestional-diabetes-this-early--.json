            "answer": "Well it COULD be morning sickness. But yes it's possible you may develop gestational diabetes later. But it's also possible that you're already diabetic. I did my glucose testing at about 5 weeks and I failed which is much too early to have gestational diabetes so I guess I'm actually diabetic without knowing\u00a0\u00a0it! Either way I would get it checked out :)",
