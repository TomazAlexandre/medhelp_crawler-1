The problem is (Ihope you aware of that) that cataract surgerywith high myopia is high risc surgery.

    "question": "I am 68 years old\u00a0\u00a0diabetic with extremely high myopia (one eye 15 and the other is 12). My farsightedness is alsopretty bad. My vision worsened within last three-four years significantly (I had -8 before). I had to change glassesevery year. Seems that cataracts worsened my vision, or it could be diabetes. My sugar is not very high. Withmedication and diet it is about 140-150 the highest. I asked about cataracts surgery and my doctor is willing todo it. But I am very concerned about complications.My question is of course which risk is higher - to have cataracts removed now or leave them along for the time being.",
