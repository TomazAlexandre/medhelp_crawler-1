            "answer": "With my first they thought I had g.d. so they put me on a diabetic diet, turns out I didn't have g.d. anyways, they put me on a carb controlled diet so for example, breakfast I had to have 30grams of carbs, snack was 15g, lunch was 45g, dinner was 30g and another snack at 15g. They gave me a chart to show what I could eat and how many grams of carbs were in the food, for example 12 grapes is 15g of carbs, stuff like that, then you have to take your blood sugar levels before you eat then 1 hour or something like that after you eat and record it, hope this helps!!",
