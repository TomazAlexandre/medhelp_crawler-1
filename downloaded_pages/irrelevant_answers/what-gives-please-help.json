            "answer": "Frequent nighttime urination can be a sign of diabetes. Adding back pain to your description could mean kidney problems. You don't need me to tell you to cut down the tea and drink water for a while to see if it helps your symptoms.Another \"watch\" could be for sleep apnea. It causes a hormone to be released that contributes to repeated nighttime urination. It also causes daytime fatigue and sleepiness. Also, sleep disorders disrupt the appetite hormones that signal hungry and full. It can cause one to feel never satisfied and result in overeating and weight gain. Also, one whose sleep is not restorative often craves food in a desperate attempt to boost energy.If it were me, I'd want my kidneys checked out and my sleep so any efforts to help could be targeted thus more effective. Both of these are potentially serious enough to merit medical attention.",
