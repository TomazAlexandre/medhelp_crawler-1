            "answer": "Diabetes and hepatic oxidative damage are associated with hepatitis C progression after liver transplantation.Cotler SJ, Kallwitz E, TenCate V, Bhushan A, Berkes J, Benedetti E, Layden-Almer J, Layden TJ, Valyi-Nagy T, Guzman G.Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA. ***@****BACKGROUND: Posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is common after liver transplantation and was recently identified as a risk factor for hepatitis C progression. Increased levels of oxidative stress have been identified in diabetes and hepatitis C. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship among PTDM, oxidative damage in liver biopsy specimens, and fibrosis progression posttransplant. METHODS: Subjects consisted of 27 hepatitis C-infected liver transplant recipients who had liver biopsy specimens available from 49 protocol liver biopsies. Paraffin embedded liver tissue sections were stained for 8-hydroxy-2' deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), an indicator of hydroxyl radical mediated tissue damage. The percentage of cells staining for 8-OHdG in a histologic section was categorized as high (>66%) versus low score (< or =66%). Fibrosis index was calculated as fibrosis score (0-4)/ years posttransplant. Time to bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (F3-4) was compared as a function of PTDM and 8-OHdG score. RESULTS: Considering all 49 biopsies, fibrosis index was higher in cases with PTDM (P<0.001) and high 8-OHdG score (P=0.004). High 8-OHdG score was associated with PTDM (P=0.012). In time to event analyses, time to F3-4 was more rapid in patients with PTDM (P=0.02) and in those with high 8-OHdG scores (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed a relationship between PTDM and hepatitis C fibrosis progression and found that oxidative damage in liver biopsy specimens was associated with PTDM and more rapid development of advanced fibrosis.Prospective study of liver transplant recipients with HCV infection: evidence for a causal relationship between HCV and insulin resistance.Delgado-Borrego A, Liu YS, Jordan SH, Agrawal S, Zhang H, Christofi M, Casson D, Cosimi AB, Chung RT.Gastrointestinal Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.An association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and insulin resistance (IR) has been recently reported. However, causality has not been established. The cross-sectional nature of most reported studies and varying degrees of fibrosis have limited definitive conclusions about the independent role of HCV in development of IR. We sought to evaluate whether HCV induces IR by prospectively analyzing a cohort of adult liver transplant (LT) recipients. A total of 34 adults (14 HCV(+) and 20 HCV(-)) who underwent consecutive LT were followed during the first year posttransplantation. IR was estimated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Univariate and multivariate repeated measures analyses and Cox regression models were used. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to age, body mass index (BMI), family history of diabetes, alcohol consumption, or laboratory indices. The cohort had no or minimal fibrosis. There was lower prednisone use in the HCV(+) group, and no difference in the use of tacrolimus between the two groups was found. IR was 77% higher in HCV(+) subjects during the first year post-LT when controlling for BMI (P = 0.035). Subjects with high HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels reached high HOMA-IR significantly earlier than those with lower HCV RNA (P = 0.03). Following the first month post-LT, HCV(+) subjects were 4 times more likely to become diabetic than HCV(-) controls (P < 0.01). In conclusion, there is significantly higher IR in the HCV(+) group during the first year post-LT. This cannot be explained by differences in BMI, medications used, alcohol consumption, or degree of fibrosis. Higher HCV RNA levels were associated with earlier elevations in HOMA-IR. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence that HCV induces the development of IR.",

Thuluvath, M.D., of Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, in an accompanying editorial.\"In a previous study, 24 of 88 patients (27%) were found to have diabetes mellitus at the end of the first postoperative year and were considered as having new-onset diabetes mellitus,\" Dr. Thuluvath wrote, \"but at the second year after liver transplantation, only eight patients (9%) had evidence of diabetes mellitus, which implies the transient nature of diabetes mellitus in many transplant recipients.\"",

A friend of mine moved out to California not too long ago and being she is from the East, the earthquake thing was on her mind when her husband told her he wanted to take the job offer. Yet my cousin has been living out there for years and no biggy. She says she never concerns herself or even thinks of earthquakes. I know you are not from California, but when I think of earthquakes, Calif of course is what comes to mind. Supposedly this NY area is on some kind of line too, but I only remember feeling one - very slight years ago. Every area of the country has something - floods or whatever.Hope you didn't get any damage to your property,,,but most of all thank God you are all right.MO",

Some of my neighbors had things fall off of shelves and break. Just minor things, nothing big. The aftershocks were pretty big too, again no damage. At the time I really believed it was the big one, but not yet. One day it will get us! My home has been built according to earthquake codes. It should take it well, or as well as possible. What a way to start the day! Haha! Thanks for checking on me sweetie.\u00a0\u00a0:o)",

My husbands friend in Florida - his house really took a beating from a quake. It was really ashame.I wonder how my dog would react. She hears thunder way before it even is anywhere near us. Most dogs do I guess, but she is a big baby. I can always tell when she hears it cause she jumps up on my lap and starts shaking and won't get off me. It is so sad - I try blasting music, but nothing helps. I should really talk to the vet about getting some kind of light sedative or something. I hate to give her drugs, but I may have too. One thing that has me a little concerned is that her last visit her enzymes are elevated!! Of course first thing I thought of was - OMG can dogs get HCV??? I can't find anything on the net that says a definite yes or no. Someone asked a vet on this one site and the vet was looking in the med book and couldn't find anything,,,,,but really, have they ever injected hcv into a dog to see if it would contract it? I hate when they experiment on dogs, but because of so many heppers owning dogs, you would think that studies of cats and dogs should be done? I know that monkeys can get it - but dogs/cats - dunno.So I asked the vet (didn't tell her I have it) if dogs can get it? She said no....but the more I think about it,,,,I am going to say,,,,\"show me the studies babeeeeee.\"Guess what she put me dog on??? Milk Thistle!MO",

Its sad to see her so upset from the thunder.So all your neighbors saw ya in your pajama's huh? I guess getting dressed would be the last thing to think of though. My neighbor comes out in less than his pajama's to get his morning paper and no earthquake!Well getting tired and it looks quiet round these parts, no party going on here tonight, huh?
