            "answer": "The important thing to do with any medication change is to work with your psychiatrist so they can give you a titration schedule to follow and be able to give direct advice as to how to address this concern. Weight gain from antipsychotics can be a concern. It might be worthwhile to ask your psychiatrist about a referral to a nutritionist. If the weight gain continues to the point where it could be of concern healthwise as regards the potential of diabetes I do know some people who experience this are prescribed Metformin as a preventative measure and you could ask your psychiatrist if this is a potential option.",
