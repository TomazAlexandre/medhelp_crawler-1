            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Well, yes, the symptoms could be due to the drugs you take. Klonopin causes easy bruising and bleeding along with extreme fatigue. Weight loss, fatigue, difficulty with concentration and memory problems are side effects of Topomax. Trazadone can lower the BP as a side effect. Apart from this high blood sugar or diabetes too can cause weight loss and fatigue. Please discuss this with your treating doctor and get the doses of the drugs adjusted or an alternate drug started. Also the blood sugar will have to be brought under control.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for your post on my question. You helped me pretty much confirm my what I all ready knew. I have been in treatment for three years, but the weight loss problem and bruising only just started recently, and I figured that with the blood sugar and blood count had to be connected.Thank you so much for your time.Sincerely,Kelly Kent",

    "question": "I take efixor xr, premerin, clonopen, verapamil, topomax and trazadone for chronic PTSD, chronic daily headaches, hormone therapy (I had a full hysterechtomy at age 21), and I take a multi vitamin as well. I am 34 years old and have lost a significant amount of weight in the past year, at least 40-50 pounds. I am 5 foot f inches and weight in at 105 pounds now.My last blood test showed my blood count as low and my blood sugar as high. I bruise way too easily and tire easily. I eat a normal diet and try to do what exercise I can (I also have injuries to both my knees from my enlistment in the Army).I guess I am asking if it may be my medications, diet, or what it might be to cause this weight loss, bruising, weakness, dizziness and memory loss and for the blood test to show a low blood count and high sugar levels.If any one might be able to help or have any suggestions, please contact me.Regards,KellyCoyote_sun76",
