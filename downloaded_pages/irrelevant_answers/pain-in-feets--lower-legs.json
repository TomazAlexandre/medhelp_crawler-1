            "answer": "If your tests are \"more or less normal,\" then I would talk with your doctors and ask them exactly what is wrong, especially if you have symptoms (problems).Ask the Neurologist why he put you on the medication Pregab.\u00a0\u00a0Is this medication helping you?Sometimes diabetes or other diseases can cause nerve pain, but there can be other causes for your pain as well.\u00a0\u00a0That is why you need to talk to your doctors who know your history and find out what is wrong.Keep up the exercise, but perhaps back off a little prior to you getting the pain.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure your shoes are comfortable with no seams digging into your feet, and examine your feet daily.\u00a0\u00a0Let us know if you have any other questions.",

            "answer": "Well the orthopedic doctor said that since thepain is not localized and keeps moving to different points and is symmetric in nature (both feets), it is related to nerves. Also with x ray, mri and some blood tests like Rheumatoid factor, ESR etc he ruled out conditions like rhemutaoid arthiritis. The neurologist doctor although did not conduct any tests, just looking at the symptoms said it must be musclo skeletal problem and I am worrying too much which may be aggravating the problem. Since I am having problems sleeping he recommended pregab 75. One reason he said it may not be neurological problem is that the problem started after my blood sugar level came down. Vascular surgeon said there may be mild narrowing of the arteries in lower limbs but it is not significant enough to cause this problem so it must be related to nerves. So overall there is no confirmed diagnosis.",

            "answer": "These doctors work mostly in different hospitals. I have consulted them based in availability and convenience of reaching where I live. I don't think it is possible to talk to each other and it works that way in my place until u get hospitalized with serious condition when the hospitais\u00a0\u00a0puts a panel of doctors on the case.Anyway I consulted another neurologist today and he said that it can happen if I have been living in high blood sugar condition undiagnosed for long and suddenly brought down the sugar levels. He also conducted nerve conduction test which mentions mild motor neuropathy. He said there is no major damage to nerves but when my blood sugar are controlled and stable the pain should go away. He also prescribed pregab 75 and supplements to be taken for next 3 weeks and come back with status. Hope his diagnosis is correct.",

Having restlessness and heaviness on my whole leg, but I am giving it a rest since I have had episodes of restlessness and pain which after a day of rest gone by itself. Hoping things will go well since I have startef taking the prescribed supplement (felicia-od ). Although I am not sure about the vit b12. I was also diagnosed deficient in b12 at the time of diagnosis for diabetes 3 months. The doctor asked me to take lot of injections for that but I took couple of injectiona and then daily doses of b12 for some time. After that in one of the blood tests I get it checked again and thw b12 came above normal range so I stopped taking b12 supplement. I hope b12 supplement do not cause any overdose issues.",

I think these supplements come in packages and its hard to find a package/ medicine without b12 in it. Even the pregab also is combined with b12.I felt better in the morning today and could go to office, although with some walking and standing I again started getting the warm feeling in the feets and pain in some areas my area near ankles and heels. But this happens usually with me during most working days (from the time this condn started). It goes away with rest during the evening and night and then I am ready for the struggle in next morning.",

            "answer": "It is highly likely that the feet pain you are experiencing is to do with nerve damage due to the high sugar levels.I can hear you say, \"Yes, but these symptoms started after my sugar levels came down.\"What happens is well before you become diagnosed as a diabetic, there are changes going on and with that damage to nerves which you will not know that is happening.Vitamin B12 is usually prescribed because lack of this vitamin can cause symptoms of pins and needles.\u00a0\u00a0A blood test would confirm if your Vitamin B12 level is OK or not.\u00a0\u00a0Vitamin 12 is a vitamin that needs to be taken every day and any excess is excreted when you urinate.\u00a0\u00a0If the blood test shows that your Vitamin B12 levels are still low, it is highly likely that your body is not absorbing this through the gut and the doctor would then inject this vitamin about every 3 months.You do not say which medication you started for your diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Some of these medications do deplete the body of Vitamin B12 and there is no reason for you to stop taking the Vitamin unless the blood tests for this Vitamin show that it is at a good level and on advice from your doctor.It is still very important for you to keep your sugar levels well controlled.\u00a0\u00a0The medication that is usually prescribed in the UK for peripheral nerve damage or damage to nerves in the legs and feet (with symptoms of pins and needles and hotness) is Amitriptyline.\u00a0\u00a0This is an antidepressant and is taken at night.\u00a0\u00a0It is also used for referred pain.\u00a0\u00a0It also helps you to sleep.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor may prescribe something similar.Make sure that you wear suitable and comfortable walking shoes.\u00a0\u00a0You may find that having insoles in the shoes helpful too.\u00a0\u00a0Now that you are a diabetic, you do need to take care of your feet and yourself.Best wishes.",

I have reduced my carbohydrate intake to the minimum required3. I have increased my intake of vegetables, pulses and fruits and also started including some of milk and yogurt in my regular diet.4. I take a home remedy of a bit of juice of bitter gourd and gooseberry in morning empty stomach every day.5.

    "question": "I was diagnosed with diabetes with high blood sugar levels around 3 months ago. I changed my diet, started medication, and started doing walks as per doctor's advice. My blood sugar levels came to normal with all these changes, which took around 3 weeks. After that\u00a0\u00a0suddenly I got severe pain in my feets. I had to take rest for 2 to 3 days when the pain cooled down and I could walk again. But anytime I walked little faster or little longer the pain would appear again and I had to take rest for couple of days. This went on and off for about 2 weeks and then I thought I should take rest for 2 to 3 weeks. I took rest and the pain cooled down buy still Iwas having pains in different parts of the feet even during rest. This has been now around 2.5 months and I still have mild pain that move around at different places of feet and sometime lower leg. Meantime I have consulted orthopedic doctors, nurologist, rheumatologist and vascular surgeon with basic tests done like x ray, mri, blood tests and ultrasound doppler test. All these tests are more or less normal as per doctors and do not explain the problem.I still continue to suffer from mild pain in my feets and occasionally lower legs, which increases with after doing short walks and cools down in rest but still happen doing rest. After daylong of short walks and standings the pain is more at night and I have to take pain killer and one medicine suggestefd by neurologist (pregab 75) to sleep.What can be the cause of this pain?",
