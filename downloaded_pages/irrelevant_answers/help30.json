I've found that the best breakfast for me is 2 slices of cinnamon raisin toast (30g of carbs), 1 scrambled egg and 3 slices of Turkey bacon. Sometimes I switch out a slice of toast for a cup of milk. I'm only allowed 30g for breakfast... Others are allowed more or less. I'm not a huge fan of eggs either, but you can add a little bit of shredded cheese if needed. If you need any other advice you can PM me. I've done quite a bit of research on what to eat and have discussed meal plans with a dietician. Good luck!",

            "answer": "Women with gestational diabetes have to watch the carbs they eat. Foods with heavy carbs include grains (pasta, rice bread), starchy vegetables (potatoes, corn), fruits, dairy, and fats. I'm limited to 30g of carbs for breakfast and 45g of carbs for lunch and dinner. I can have a 15g snack between breakfast-lunch and lunch-dinner and a 30g snack after dinner. Proteins like cheese/meats/meat substitutes have negligible carbs.Breakfast: 2 slices of buttered cinnamon raisin bread (30g of carbs), 3 slices of Turkey bacon and 1 scrambled egg.Lunch: a Turkey sandwich with cheese (heated up) (30g for the 2 slices of bread) and a side of 1 serving of fruit (15g)Dinner: 1/2 cup potato or pasta or 1/3 cup rice (15g), some type of meat (protein), a non-starchy vegetable, a serving of fruit (15g) and a dinner roll (15g)Snacks: Greek yogurt (15-17g), a protein bar (17g), a serving of fruit (15g), string cheese, cottage cheese, 1 oz. cheese and 6 saltine crackers (15g), 1 serving of nuts...My advice is to know which foods have the most carbs and make sure to check the nutrition label to make sure how much you can eat.",
