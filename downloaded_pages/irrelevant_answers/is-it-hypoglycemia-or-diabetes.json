    "question": "I have had hypoglycemia all my life. I also know that sometimes this can turn into diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Recently the hypoglycemia has gotten much worse. I am concerned about this. I have way too many other health problems, I really don\u2019t need this one too. I did some research on the symptoms for diabetes. I have about 80% of the symptoms. I don\u2019t have insurance so, I went and bought a cheap blood glucose tester. I assumed it would give a high and low glucose level. It didn\u2019t.\u00a0\u00a0I tested about 3 hours after I ate, and the test said 118.Is this high? Low?Hoping I don't have diabetes.",
