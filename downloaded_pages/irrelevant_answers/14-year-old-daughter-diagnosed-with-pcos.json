            "answer": "I have pcos and my mother is type 2 diabetic but I am not. BCP was prescribed for me and was helpful but we have been ttc for 10 yrs now so no Bcp for me unless I get a cyst. You might look into metformin which is a med commonly prescribed for PCOS. It's tough on the tummy but eventually you get used to it and things get better. It's essentially a hormone imbalance that causes this.\u00a0\u00a0Pregnancy is possible with PCOS but it may take a little longer ttc. I was treated by my GYN for PCOS and now my reproductive endocrinologist going thru ivf but for many other reasons in addition to PCOS. Limiting sugar intake helps and seeing a natural healing professional for acupuncture are things I do as well. They are very helpful suggesting supplements and more natural ways of coping with this. I know nothing about the other diagnosis your daughter has been given. There is a community on med help dedicated to pcos in case you want to check it out.Best of luck to you and your family. If you want to message me I would be happy to share what I know.Ginger",

            "answer": "I would ask to have some blood sugar tests done. I'm not diabetic but PCOS means I developed gestaitional diabetes in pregnancy and also am PRE diabetic when not pregnant. So very close to the line.What does she suffer with? cos that effects what she should be treated with.. does she struggle with losing weight/maintaining a steady weight? excess hair? irregular periods? hormonal?Let us know, hopefully we can help, HOWEVER, you do need to ask a consultant these questions, a real medical professional. I was seen by an endochronologist but he wasn't much help. I've found great help online and in forums really!PCOS she should be definitely not having sugar, even consider cutting it out all together, but rule out diabetes first. Low carb diet (no white carbs as they're full of sugar and have no nutritional value) Wholemean carbohydrates only. No fizzy drinks - full of sugar.. stick to healthy vegetables, steamed / boiled meat... wholemeal carbs, and water / slightly flavoured water. just relaly limit the sugar intake as it can make us with PCOS pile on the weight. I wish i'd known it years ago and maybe I wouldn't have 4 stone to lose that isn't shifting. Good luck! but do speak to a professional .x",

            "answer": "as far as fertility, the less weight you have on you helps with PCOS. I tried for a year, miscarried, then lost 21lbs with a low carb, no sugar diet... and got pregnant :) she's now nearly one years old and i'm 15 weeks with my second. of course I'm very luck and greatful. Some women really do struggle. . but there are meds for this, some women have to have IVF etc but that's in extreme cases. Metformin can be prescribed for fertility, regulating periods.. AND controlling weight. Any other qs and I'd be happy to help as much as I can based on my experience with this. x",

            "answer": "I recently found out the I have PCOS... funny thing is that i've had four successful pregnancies, the last resulting in twins. After the twins my hormones went haywire and I found out about the PCOS. I suspect after my third pregnancy I had some of the symptoms too but never tied it together. Anyways... I have heard that most with PCOS end up with insulin resistance. I did. I am not taking the metformin. My dietician told me that I can keep it at bay by eating healthy and exercising. If I stay at a healthy body weight then I should be able to naturally control it. I did not want to deal with the stomach upset that comes along with metformin. The main thing to watch when you think you may have insulin resistance is your carbs. I have been eating 180g or less of carbs and I feel much better and have finally been able to lose weight again. (before I found out I had it I was doing p90x and actually gained body fat instead of losing. sooo frustrating. that's how I found out about the insulin resistance). Good luck!",

You don't have to be obese to have pcos and not everyone has excessive hair. Definitely get her checked by the gyno, understandable that you aren't impressed.",

My doctor did not do a test on me because of all my symptoms. He just automatically prescribed metformin which I refused to take since the dietician said that I can keep it under control through diet and exercise. Officially down 6lbs in one week. Very awesome. I would go to another doctor or have the GYN run the tests since he diagnosed her. I'm sure not many PEDs deal with this type of thing since it happens in teen years and usually found out at a GYN. Good luck! (I also do not have a beard. lol. Too funny).",
