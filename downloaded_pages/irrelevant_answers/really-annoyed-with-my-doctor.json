            "answer": "Ok, having gestational diabetes does not guarantee you having diabetes for the rest of your life. Is it more likely? Yes. I think you may be like me. What caused me to fail the test was the fact that only sugary beverages cause my sugar to spike. Food just doesn't do it because all of the vitamins and protein there to offset the sugar. I am now on insulin because I had to get two steroid shots for preterm labor a few weeks ago and it causes sugar spikes. Lately my sugar has been dropping to the 50s. Anything under 70 can be dangerous and cause seizures and a lot of other problems. Yesterday I forgot to take my insulin and my sugar had dropped to 48. I had a blizzard from DQ and it only put it at 97. My sugar always seems higher with insulin. :/",

And just because you have gd doesnt mean you'll have it forever. There's a 60% chance you'll develope it later in life. Sounds like she doesn't want to do her job properly and is just doing a general sweep diagnosis instead of making your care personal.",

Yes, the doctor does think that because of your weight, since weight is the leading cause of type 2 diabetes, and almost every overweight person either has, or will have it in the very near future. Also, a sugar of 265 is pretty extreme, which is why she prescribed medication. Any doctor would do so with an overweight patient who can't control their sugar. It's too dangerous to the baby not to.",

    "question": "So I went for my GD testing Monday. Thursday I found out my sugar shot up to 265. Well Friday I go get my metor and diet plan and my doctor said I was a diabetic and will be for the rest of my life. Okay I accepted that and right away started my diet. Well she put me on glyburide to lower my sugar. Friday night I took my first pill and twice my sugar dropped very low. Today I did my just my diet and I can't keep my sugar up to 110 for nothing. I am doing my diet and I walked around the block two diff times today. Ate what is on my list that I am allowed to have. And my sugar didn't go past 95. Well after lunch I did a lil around the house and went walking again I came home and checked my sugar again and it was almost to the 40's I drank not even a half a bottle and my sugar went up to 112. The highest it has been all day. Monday I am calling her but I'm sure she will say I am doing something wrong. I check my blood sugar 2 hours after each meal. Sorry for the lil rant I just feel like my doctor rushed me on medication instead of seeing how I would be on diet and working out alone.",
