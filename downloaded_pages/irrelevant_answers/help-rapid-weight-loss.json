            "answer": "I had the same thing. If you eat a little in the morning like half an orange or an apple you get the natural sugar from the fruit and it isn't going to effect your weight loss if you still want to loose weight rapidly. I went through not eating but I played sports so I had to have energy so this is what helped me the most. Anything with natural sugars works really well",

            "answer": "Losing that much weight is not normal... There are 3 things that come to mind that could be causing your weight loss and both could be very dangerous.\u00a0\u00a0The first is hyperthyroidism (over active thyroid), in which your thyroid produces too much thyroid hormones.\u00a0\u00a0The second is diabetes, but it doesn't really sound like that, though you should get checked for it.\u00a0\u00a0The third is anorexia and a body image problem if you aren't seeing that you're losing all this weight.Are you trying to eat, at all?\u00a0\u00a0If not, you need to make yourself aware of the need to eat and be sure to eat something small at regular intervals - possibly even as often as every couple of hours.And no - fruit is not that good for you, especially, if you might have diabetes, because even natural sugar spikes your blood sugar levels which creates a need for insulin and if your body isn't producing insulin, you're putting your body into a crisis situation.\u00a0\u00a0 You need to get checked out by a doctor... talk to your parents about this.",

            "answer": "Deborah does not want to lose weight that rapidly... it's not good for anyone to lose 32 lbs in 3 weeks... that's starvation and will cause health problems as she gets older.Something with protein, in the morning, like a hard boiled egg, a piece of cheese, a carton of yogurt, etc is much better for you than just a piece of fruit, because protein gives you energy and stays with you much longer than the fruit.\u00a0\u00a0While the piece of fruit gives you quick energy, but it can also spike your blood sugar, if you don't use it all right away and whenever blood sugar is spiked, insulin levels rise.Insulin is a hormone produced by your pancreas that handles excess sugar in your body.\u00a0\u00a0What does it do with the sugar?\u00a0\u00a0It stores it in fat cells to be used \"later\", which often never comes, because we keep eating more and more that keeps getting stored.\u00a0\u00a0And it's not just sugar... it's all kinds of things that quickly turn to sugar after you eat them, like bread, pizza crust, pancakes, waffles, cookies, cakes, pasta, rice and all the other processed food you eat.Just because a sugar is \"natural\" doesn't mean it's good for you...",

    "question": "Hello, I lost 32 pounds in a matter of 3 weeks and have recently lost another 10. My eating habits have completely changed and I know eat very little. I will get to 8:00 PM and then realize that I haven't eaten anything all day.I am not doing this intentionally but I think it has gotten out of hand. As much as it is subconscious when I look into the mirror I don't really like what I see. Everyone comments on how much weight I've lost but I don't seem to see it.I am not sure what is causing it, but sometimes I will just get this feeling that I am going to pass out. My head feels cloudy and I can't concentrate, and I feel sick to my stomach but I can't through up because I haven't eaten anything.",
