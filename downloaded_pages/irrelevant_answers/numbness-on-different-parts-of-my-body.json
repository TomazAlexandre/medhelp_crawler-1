I might have M.S.I think I am in shock today but I am glad that I am an optimistic person. I always feel happy and joyful.I will be surprised if I let this get me down.I am a little frustrated though because I was training to be a professional modern dancer, I\u00a0\u00a0could have had a job instructing a dance/excercise class at our local gym. I was hoping to teach a yoga/strength class and I wanted to enter a fitness competition.If I have M.S. , will that not be a little ironic.I really miss moving. I am basically bedridden and house bound. I use all my energy for my family and my career at home.",

    "question": "I have numbness, which has the same sensation as having dental freezing, on different parts of my body at different times. Sometimes it's on the right side of my face, sometimes the left, sometimes in my ears, sometimes in the pelvic region, sometimes one finger , sometimes some toes, sometimes parts of my arms. Plus I am in a lot of pain, constantly ,\u00a0\u00a0and they are just not getting it. I don't have Fybromyalgia. I feel like I have a really high fever all the time and I keep checking my temperature , and I am always amazed that it is normal. My ears hurt alot, and I want to get my hearing checked soon.
