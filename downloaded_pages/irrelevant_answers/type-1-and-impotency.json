            "answer": "As i have the same problem but i can still feel when my wife and i have sex one thing i can recommend is that your husband see a urologist. a urologist would be aware of any options available to solve the problem. i think this is one of the saddest problems of diabetes and is caused by autonomic neuropathy. i have had an implant put in that is a device that inflates with a sterile saline solution. The bulb holding the fluid is in the scrotum and is pressed making an erection and there is a valve that is pressed to release the fluid back into the bulb making it go limp again. But while waiting for the surgery i did have relations with my wife and i just enjoyed the fact that we were together. So don't think it is entirely without satisfaction. i hope this helps. But i am not a doctor and this is definitely a problem for a doctor. Good luck, bret",

            "answer": "I am sorry to hear your partner also has ED and numbness to go with his neuropathy. I have also suffered this progressively for the past 20 years, though I have not lost all sensation.\u00a0\u00a0I too can function with the new drugs available. I agree with BL above that just sharing whatever closeness and sexuality is possible is certainly better than nothing at all. For me, the sensation to touch is almost nothing at the start, but some feeling does return after erection occurs. It does not feel nearly as good as it used to, but my standards have finally adapted, and I am quite satisfied. I also lost the ability to ejaculate (anejaculation) over 25 years ago, and it has taken me almost this long to finally come to terms with\u00a0\u00a0what I thought was the",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for replying everyone - I'm very sad about this as it's my partner who does not want to try and has asked me to accept it will never happen again.\u00a0\u00a0It's partly because of the humiliation he feels at 'having his manhood' taken away.\u00a0\u00a0I can only hope that in time he comes to terms with this better.Having read some of your kind comments however, I'm going to go back to him and give him some of the information which will hopefully enable us to try again.\u00a0\u00a0It's certainly very scary for me to think that we would never be intimate for the rest of our time together...Thanks to everyone again.",
