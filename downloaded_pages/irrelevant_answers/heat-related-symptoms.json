    "question": "I have read several commments regarding heat stroke/exhaustion. No one has mentioned swelling. If I exert myself when temps are hot and humidity high, my face and ears swell up. They itch and are bright red. The only thing that seems to help is a steroid shot and prednisone pack. My face and ears will peel almost like a sunburn. Does this happen to anyone out there?If I sweat during the night I will get itchy. Gold Bond medicated powder helps tremendously. Put it on before you go to bed in areas that you sweat. Neck, chest and even on the insides of your elbows. It does help!",
