My 13 year old son has had Type 1 since he was three and is one of the happiest and healthiest kids I know now.\u00a0\u00a0It is not a death sentence -- trust me.But it does take work to stay healthy and it takes time to figure it all out.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to check your blood sugar, take your insulin, eat healthy and don't stress out.\u00a0\u00a0Complications are obviously possible but happen more with Type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Your life will not be the same but you can still live a happy healthy rewarding full life as long as you do what the doctor tells you.\u00a0\u00a0Since you are a medical student you probably know about all the advances lately -- there are insulin pumps, glucose sensors, great meters, and new insulins.\u00a0\u00a0There is also stem cell and islet cell research being done. Keep thinking that I am going to do my best to stay healthy until there is a cure and not that I am going to be blind some day.\u00a0\u00a0Think positive.\u00a0\u00a0We are in this together.Carol",

            "answer": "I have been a type 1 diabetic for 34 years, and I was diagnosed long before the newest medicines and even before home glucose monitoring was possible. I have two grown and healthy children (I had the children as a diabetic on insulin), a loving husband, and a wonderful life with NO complications 34 years later. You are not necessarily doomed to the complications that\u00a0\u00a0you read about. As a diabetic, I have to take the shots and monitor my diet, but I frankly find myself healthier in my middle years (46 now) than many of my peers. Please step back, take a breath, and realize that perhaps God has allowed this to enter your life so you can help other diabetics. You truly would never know what it was like to live with the disease if you had not been unfortunate enough to be diagnosed wtih it. In time, you will figure out what the proper dose is for good control and it is very possible with the newest treatments to keep healthy glucose levels without overdosing. You will feel energetic and will be able to better cope with emotional upheaval once you get the glucose levels up to above 70 to stay. Keep watching this web site, for I know that there are many other long-timers who will tell you the same thing: you can live a long and healthy life as a diabetic. Your education will help you do this. Then, use that knowledge to help others.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your replies. You are all very nice people who can really comfort each other. It's very difficult to find peer support in Hong Kong as there are so few type 1 patients. I think there won't be more than 1000 type 1 out of the 6 million population.While I'm complaining why I'm so unfortunate, I should think that I'm already better than most of the patients with the same disease as I have a relatively late onset (I'm 22 now) I'm also cared by almost the best endocrinologists in Hong Kong who are working in a teaching hospital. But I would say that being a type 1 patient in the US should be easier as the endocrinologists have more experience.I guess all of you have your medical expenses covered by insurance companies? In Hong Kong people seldom buy medical insurance as most of the services are provided by the public system, but this is going to change and the patients will eventually need to pay for the services themselves. I don't know what will happen to me in the future, as I didn't buy any insurance, but there are too many things to worry anyway.I always think that it's harder for me to accept the diagnosis than lay people as I know too much about the complications. Take retinopathy as an example, a lay person will only get concerned if the vision is affected, but the doctor (or I myself) will get concerned if there're early sings of retinopathy (like background, non-proliferative etc. if it involves the macula it's called maculopathy). And the figures tell me that 100% of type 1 patients will get retinopathy within 20 years after diagnosis of DM (but doesn't count the years before puberty), sometimes retinopathy can be quite independent of glucose control, there are still people who have been controlling well but still have severe retinopathy. Doctors won't tell lay people about these, as this is too discouraging. Being a patient and a patient only has the advantage that you can only hear what you need to hear and what is encouraging, but I'm different, I need to hear facts for the doctors as well (which are not for patients as they are too bad for that)",

            "answer": "The figures I have read here in the United States are that 80% if diabetics suffer some retinopathy after 15 years, not 100%. I posted an earlier comment, telling you that I have had diabetes for 34 years and have NO retinopathy at all. You are absolutely correct in your observations that some folks take perfect control of the glucose numbers and still have this problem occur, but some of us don't. I would encourage you to use your knowledge, which is far beyond the knoweldge of the average type 1 diabetic, to do whatever you can to protect yourself and keep those glucose numbers even-keeled. I am living proof that the 100% number is incorrect. In my volunteering wtih the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, I do hear from other long-time diabetics like myself who have no damages. Take heart. Your knowledge can be a help to you if you focus your thoughts on how to manage the disease rather than on fears of the unknown future. Just take the one day at a time and make that day a good one, and God will take care of your future.",

Don't be frozen in your fear, take your knowledge and do something positive with it, for yourself and others.At first, it's so very difficult to accept diabetes into your life, but in time, you will feel differently.\u00a0\u00a0You need to face the emotional side of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It may be more difficult in your culture than in ours to do this, so please, come back to our site to let us know how you are doing and feel free to ask any question or comment you may have.\u00a0\u00a0We are here for you!God Bless You!",

            "answer": "Diabetes is a horrible life long condition - no doubt about that.\u00a0\u00a0And it complicates life, makes you change your life. Nobody wants this - but 1 in 16 people have it.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately - there's not much you can do to reverse it.\u00a0\u00a0You already know all of this.But - you read too much into it as well.\u00a0\u00a0The complications you speak of, normally are associated with people who don't take care of themselves or are too lazy to take care of themselves - pure and simple.\u00a0\u00a0And many of those people are Type 2s.I gave up blaming God a long time ago - if there is one.\u00a0\u00a0Neither God nor Allah have anything to do with this.\u00a0\u00a0And if they are there - it looks like they are not too interested in lending a hand because there are so many of us and our numbers only grow with each passing year.I would highly suggest you get an Insulin Pump as quickly as possible.\u00a0\u00a0There are people who will tell you to wait until your honeymoon period is over - forget them.\u00a0\u00a0At least with a pump, it may be possible to give your Pancreas a break and not burn out the remaining insulin producing cells you still have.\u00a0\u00a0It'll mean lower basal doses of insulin and give you more freedom that you'll never get with just needle injections.However - the pump has its own set of issues the pump makers don't advertise because people wouldn't want to use the pumps then.\u00a0\u00a0But - it does make life easier somewhat.\u00a0\u00a0And injecting an infusion set once every 3 days sure beats having to stick yourself with a needle before every meal or hoping someone doesn't bump your chair while you inject yourself.I wouldn't hold my breath for beta cell transplants or pancreas transplants.\u00a0\u00a0Those are still years away from being any sort of real solution.My health insurance only covers a fraction of my Diabetic pump and testing supplies and only a tiny amount of the total price of the pump.\u00a0\u00a0Heck - they just took LifeScan's blood testing monitors entirely off their preferred list and forced everyone to Accuchek - a cheaper, less quality monitor.\u00a0\u00a0My insurance wanted to get rid of Humalog off their list too and it was only recently they even considered Lantus.I will not beat around the bush - I hate the life Diabetes has forced me to adapt to.\u00a0\u00a0It's painful.\u00a0\u00a0It's taken the fun out of most things - especially eating out.\u00a0\u00a0And it gets in the way of just about everything.\u00a0\u00a0When the end of my life comes, I probably will not fight for that last breath.Not to take any hope away from you - Diabetes doesn't necessarily mean you stop living as soon as you are diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0It's just another thing you have to deal with in life.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't go away so you deal with it, do what you have to keep it from ruining anything else, and move on.\u00a0\u00a0You don't have any other choice.\u00a0\u00a0Just accept that it has happened to you, make the changes to your life that you have to, and keep going.\u00a0\u00a0You have a whole life - this is only one small part.",

            "answer": "For the complication rates, I think it's different in different countries and different time. If you have follow-up in a teaching hospital with an advanced research center, it's definitely different if you have that in a remote hospital. I think the complication rate is lower in the US, as I've said there are more experts. But anyway, I don't think the figures are very important as these are highly unpredictable and it really depends on individual cases. It's probably not correct to say that complications only occur with people with poor control, because duration of diabetes is also a major risk factor, and there's also the genetic susceptibiliy. The only thing you can do is to have good control, you can't do much about other risk factors. I admit that I may be exaggerating about the complications, as I'm in a tertiary referral center and all the cases I've seen are those difficult cases and with lots of complications. galzee is quite correct to point out that I'm not thinking in a very sensible way, scared by the knowledge but not using it properly.for JDRF team SGG, your example is quite encouraging, I do feel better after having your reasurance.There are a few other questions I want to ask:1. TonyAlmeida told me about the insulin pump. Actually I want to know more. Does the pump cause you any local discomfort at the infusion site? I don't really like the idea of having something inserted all the time. I have frequent turning when I sleep, does it going to affect my sleep then?2. Do you have difficulty bringing your insulin pen or lancets when you need to get a plane? Do they stop you from doing so because they think these items are dangerous?3. Do you think having diabetes affect your chance of getting a boyfriend/girlfriend? For females, are you worried about the risk of getting pregnant?",

            "answer": "Dear Medical Student, I am back to add more thoughts. I am the long-time diabetic who keeps surfacing to try to encourage you. I have had two children, both healthy pregnancies with full-term babies and no damages to me from being pregnant. Now, this was over twenty years ago when medical care was not as good as it is now. If I could do it then, you can do it now with the newer medical knowledge and care available. I actually have asked my husband if the fact that I was diabetic when we met ever scared him. I suppose ignorance was bliss, for he said it never occurred to him that it may cause problems later on. It hasn't, and for that I am glad. I have been a USTA (United States Tennis Association) rated tennis player and spent two years as a white water raft guide starting the year of my 40th birthday. A fully normal life is possible for you. Although genetics do play a role in complications or lack of complications, tight blood sugar control will keep the glucose highs a rarity, and complications are much less likely to happen if sugar levels never stay high for hours on end. A pump may be a good solution, or a combination of Lantus and a quick-acting insulin. I find that this works well for me and keeps my sugars very well-controlled. I do a lot of finger pricks and do what is necessary to lower or raise glucose levels when I need to. As you develop habits, it will become easier. I honestly don't see it as a big deal, for it has become routine. And life is so full of wonderful things that this becomes a minor part of my life, more of a habit than a focus.",

All through his childhood I worried and kept him safe from all sorts of childhood hazards. And then who would have thought the worst one to get by me would be in his own body? My point is that what I worried about happening didn't, and what I didn't even consider happening did. So we really have no full control over our destiny.Just try to handle your diabetes TODAY because honestly, none of us know if we have a tomorrow. Do what you can do today, do the same tomorrow, and on and on. Persistent worrying won't change anything and truly, I have found that acceptance of the disease has really made a world of difference with my son. It's just part of his ife. Sure it ***** sometimes but it IS his life and he hasn't let diabetes get in the way of living the teenage life.Your best bet is to become knowlegable about the disease, test your sugar #'s regularly and try your best to keep the #'s in a good range.

    "question": "I'm a 4th year medical student in Hong Kong. I experienced ther classical symptoms of diabetes 6 months ago and raised the suspicion of DM, then it was confirmed. I have been so upset with the diagnosis, crying all day long for the first few days. I still can't help crying for long when I'm alone at this moment. My life has been so smooth, I had good academic result, got a boyfriend who is working as a doctor, it has been perfect...but suddenly it seems that my dreams are destroye with the sudden diagnosis. I know too much about diabetes and its complications, that made things even worse. I just searched and searched the journals about type 1 diabetes and got scared by the poor prognosis. I'm a christian and I just can't understand why god gave me such a disease, I blamed god for that. Type 1 DM is very rare in Chinese, the incidence is around 0.14/100000 per year. Why am I so unfortunate? As i'm too worried about the complications, I just keep injecting too much insulin, often had blood glucose level at around 32 mmol/l. My endocrinologist keeps reminding me that I'm going to die from this if I go on like this. But I just can't imagine the days with blindness, with amputation, with stroke resulting in hemiplegia, with end-stage renal failure requiring dialysis. I'm seeing this kind of pateints (usually with type 2 in Hong Kong) with all sorts of complications everyday, whenever I study everything is related to diabetes... I always think that I'd rather die from hypoglycaemia than leading a life like this......",
