    "question": "I just saw my doctor and she told me I had an FBS of 118 and my Hba1c was 6.6%. I have not been dianosed with diabetes. She said that I still not a type 2 diabetic but just to be safe she told me to start taking glucophage once a day for 1 week and increase to 2x a day after that. Then I will repeat my tests in January. Should I start taking the meds as she prescribe. I am not overweight and no one in my family is diabetic.Thanks",
