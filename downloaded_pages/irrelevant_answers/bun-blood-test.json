            "answer": "Cinnabon,My suggestion is that you call your doc to clarify what the results mean in your case.\u00a0\u00a0It's terrific, you know, that you're working so diligently to take good care of yourself.Each lab has a \"lab normal\" range and since you didn't provide that normal range, it's impossible to fully interpret your results.\u00a0\u00a0Since the results showed \"out of range,\" it's good to talk with your doc about it.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to our kidneys' functioning, certain medications can affect the results.So discuss your BUN results specifically with your doc.\u00a0\u00a0It's possible that s/he overlooked something important, and it's possible that your results are of no concern and that's why s/he didn't discuss it.Here are two websites with information about the test:http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/bun/test.htmlhttp://my.webmd.com/hw/kidney_failure/aa36271.asp",

    "question": "I have a concern...Recently I recieved my blood test back indicating my A1c was a bit bad. I have had real tight control for a month now. My Endo at the time did not mention my (BUN) results and I noticed it reads\u00a0\u00a0out of range at a 35 with a ratio of 39. My Creatinine is 0.9 which is good, but his has me very concerned. Does this improve with better glucose control or is this the result of a diet too high in protein? Can anyone shed some light?",
