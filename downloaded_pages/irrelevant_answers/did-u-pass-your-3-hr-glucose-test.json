            "answer": "My doctor and I have decided to just skip the testing since I was with my last pregnancy. I have been having some bad blood sugar drops and had been dreading that drink. I just about passed out with the 3 hour before. Many people can control it with diet, I did last time just by diet. Eventually it just becomes natural to look at the carbs. I hope you pass the test, but if you don't, just follow the diet. Avoid carbs, eat protein and veggies, and have 3 small-medium meals with 2 snacks. Follow your dietitians advice and good luck to all of you.",
