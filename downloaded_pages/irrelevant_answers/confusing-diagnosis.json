    "question": "An opthamologist tells me I have very significant thinning of the optic nerve NFL in both eyes. There is significant elevation of the nerve head in the right eye, irregular nerve head in the left eye. There is no cupping. The blood vessels are dilated. The blind spot is enlarged. Light pigmentation in the macular area. These findings are for both eyes but the nerve damage in the right eye is worse.\u00a0\u00a0I have PVD in the left eye, but I'm 70 so that shouldn't be a surprise. I have no symptoms or test results indicating diabetes or glaucoma. The photos of my eyes generally show no change in the nerve in the past year. Before this I had never gotten any of these high-tech photos of my eyes.I went to this doctor after getting several months of vision therapy for longstanding strabismis (it didn't help much) and noticing that my vision was deteriorating so that I needed a new prescription after six months. The doctor gave me several dire predictions about the possible causes/effects of the nerve damage but now says it's not clear what caused the damage and whether the situation is causing my vision loss. He also says that the vision problems probably stem from cataracts. The previous visit he had told me I had tiny cataracts and they couldn't be causing my problems.Can anyone shed any light on this? What should I do? How worried should I be, if at all?",
