            "answer": "Thanks Strawberri.I test twice a day,once in a.m. upon awakening and once at night before going to sleep. I am not on any meds now but was on Glipizide and my glucose was so erratic so doc switched me to Glyburide and that kept my glucose too low so got off meds alltogether. I drink coffee all during the day and evening. Since becoming diabetic after a bad case of pneumonia almost 3 years ago it seems I stay hungry so I drink coffee (with Splanda and sugar-free creamer) constantly to help curve the desire to eat. Will only coffee affect my glucose reading if that's ALL I have to eat or drink during the 2 hours before I test at night? Once again thanks.",

            "answer": "KnotRough says:\"I drink coffee all during the day and evening.\"I'm experimenting with controlling my recently diagnosed Type II Diabetes with exercise, proper diet, green tea, cinnamon and NO DRUGS. Can't stand the thought of taking those drugs.\u00a0\u00a0I find if I eat REGULARLY (a real discipline for me!) 3 meals a day with snacks, and am careful about what I eat and how it is prepared, it works beautifully.I was helped by the following which I read:\"Eating Right on a Diabetes DietIf you have diabetes, it\u2019s important to eat right every day to keep your blood glucose levels even and stay healthy. Here are some easy tips:\u00b7\tBe sure to eat a wide variety of foods. Having a colorful plate is the best way to ensure that you are eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, meats, and other forms of protein such as nuts, dairy products, and grains/cereals.\u00b7\tEat the right amount of calories to maintain a health weight.\u00b7\tChoose foods high in fiber such as whole grain breads, fruit, and cereal. They contain important vitamins and minerals. You need 25 to 35 grams of fiber per day. Studies have shown that people with type 2 diabetes who eat a high fiber diet can improve their blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Similar results have been shown in some studies in people with type 1 diabetes.How? Aim for 3 small meals and 3 healthy snacks each day to balance out your blood sugar:\u00b7\tBreakfast\u00b7\tA mid-morning snack\u00b7\tLunch\u00b7\tA mid-afternoon snack\u00b7\tDinner\u00b7\tAn evening snackI've been inspired by actively researching Type II Diabetes on the web and especially information about the use of foods, herbs, supplements and alternative methods of \"healing\" rather than drugs which just treat the symptoms.Shanti",

            "answer": "Thanks ShantiI try to eat 3 decent meals a day with snacks inbetween meals and a late night snack before retiring. This seems to work pretty well for me but I usually awake with glucose levels in the 90-130 range which isn't too bad. The research I've done online was a bit confusing as some said to eat meals and snacks as you stated and others say to eat several small meals a day without snacking and only a snack right before going to sleep. Guess every case of diabetes is different and each of us has to experiment until we hit the right formula.Here's the real kicker...I'm 52 yrs. old and 6 ft. tall and weight 143 lbs. on average and I can not gain weight. I even drink Ensure during the day and it doesn't help...just raises my blood sugar (but within acceptable ranges usually).God bless",
