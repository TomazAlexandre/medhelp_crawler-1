    "question": "For some time now I've been suffering with unusual symptoms in my throat. Some of the most disturbing symptoms include in mild burning sensation and the feeling of gas bubbles constantly moving up my throat. If I so much as bend over my throat will gurgle very loudly. There is no correlation with food and medication such as PPIs and H2-blockers do nothing.\u00a0\u00a0I have also considered anxiety and have been on antidepressants such as 15 mg of mirtazapine, which also have no effect. The only thing I have found to make the burning in my throat is worse is ice cold water. Often however there is nothing I can do to get rid of the burning or burping, even alkaline water at PH 8.5 cannot stop it. Belching even one sometimes causes mucus to appear in my throat, however I am not sure if the mucus was already there.I have already been for a number of tests including an endoscopy, barium swallow and a rapid spit test.\u00a0\u00a0I have also made a number of lifestyle changes such as changes to my diet, elevating the head of my bed and so on. Next month I am expecting a 24-hour ph test from the company Restech. Until then can anyone please help me figure out what is wrong with me as the symptoms are very debilitating, and cause a great deal of anxiety for me. ..Thank you for any help you can offer.",
