            "answer": "I am not a doctor, but I am a type 1 Diabetic. Here is what Mayo Clinic says about Diabetic coma: If you have diabetes, dangerously high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) or dangerously low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can lead to a diabetic coma. If you lapse into a diabetic coma, you're alive \u2014 but you can't awaken or respond purposefully to sights, sounds or other types of stimulation. Left untreated, a diabetic coma can be fatal.A diabetic coma doesn't strike out of the blue. You'll first experience signs and symptoms of high blood sugar or low blood sugar.High blood sugarIf your blood sugar level is too high, you may experience:\u25a0Increased thirst\u25a0Frequent urination\u25a0Dry mouth\u25a0Nausea\u25a0Vomiting\u25a0Shortness of breathLow blood sugarIf your blood sugar level is too low, you may feel:\u25a0Shaky or nervous\u25a0Tired\u25a0Sweaty\u25a0Hungry\u25a0Irritable\u25a0ConfusedProlonged blood sugar extremes \u2014 blood sugar that's either too high or too low for too long \u2014 may cause various conditions, all of which can lead to a diabetic coma.\u25a0Diabetic ketoacidosis. If your muscle cells become starved for energy, your body may respond by breaking down fat stores. This process forms toxic acids known as ketones. Left untreated, diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to a diabetic coma. Diabetic ketoacidosis is most common in people who have type 1 diabetes, but it can also affect people who have type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes.\u25a0Diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome. If your blood sugar level tops 600 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 33 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), the condition is known as diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome. When your blood sugar gets this high, your blood becomes thick and syrupy. The excess sugar passes from your blood into your urine, which triggers a filtering process that draws tremendous amounts of fluid from your body. Left untreated, diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome can cause life-threatening dehydration and loss of consciousness. Diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome is most common in older adults who have type 2 diabetes.\u25a0Hypoglycemia. Your brain needs glucose to function. In severe cases, low blood sugar may cause you to pass out. Hypoglycemia is most common in people who take too much insulin or skip meals or snacks. Exercising too vigorously or drinking too much alcohol can have the same effect. How quickly your blood sugar drops influences the symptoms of hypoglycemia. For example, if it takes a few hours for your blood sugar to drop 50 mg/dL (3 mmol/L), the symptoms may be minimal. If your blood sugar drops the same amount in a few minutes, the symptoms will be more pronounced.Anyone who has diabetes is at risk of a diabetic coma. Risk factors for the conditions that may lead to a diabetic coma vary, however.For example, diabetic ketoacidosis is most common in people who have type 1 diabetes. Diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome is most common in older adults who have type 2 diabetes \u2014 especially those who don't monitor their blood sugar or who don't know they have diabetes.Your husband has to keep a very tight control os his Diabetes even if he has perfect good circulation, BP, etc.I've been very close to go into a Diabetic Coma (I didn't know that I had diabetes). Fortunately I was taken to a hospital where I treated and diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes.Please, tell your husband that he has to be very diligent. Have him seeing a Endocrinologist and a Diabetes Educator and try be with him so you both learn and you are able to help him.Best Wishes!",
