            "answer": "Your surgeon is responsible for explaining the risks and benefits of back surgery for your particular case.\u00a0\u00a0We are not looking at your MRI and your chart like he is, and we do not have medical degrees.\u00a0\u00a0I have worked for orthopedic surgeons, and generally they don't like to do back surgery because it does not have great success rate compared to other orthopedic surgeries.\u00a0\u00a0That is probably because there is more weight on the lower back.\u00a0\u00a0The more overweight you are, the worse it is.\u00a0\u00a0On top of that you have comorbid conditions that are unfortunate.\u00a0\u00a0I hope it goes well for you, but I can't advise you whether you will be satisfied with the outcome.",
