            "answer": "Hello ozone7777,I am one of the volunteers here, so, please keep in mind that I am NOT a medical professional.\u00a0\u00a0My input is based on my experience in caring for my son who is 10 and was diagnosed at age 3.\u00a0\u00a0My sister was diagnosed 9 years ago at age 24, so we have 2 in our family living with type 1.The first thing that comes to mind is that if you are able, you should accompany your father to see his endocrinologist, as well as the Opthamologist (I hope I have the specialist correct).\u00a0\u00a0Express your concerns and bring a list of questions with you.I understand that it is not only his diabetes that concerns you, but his high blood pressure, as well.I am sure that his endocrinologist will have a plan of action as far as a change to his regular insulin schedule/dosage for that day.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I am certain your dad will be monitored during surgery, but I feel that for your peace of mind (although you will still worry), you REALLY need to (if at all possible) accompany your Dad to his doctors appointments before his surgery and have your list of questions ready.\u00a0\u00a0Write down any question that comes to your mind between now and then.\u00a0\u00a0This is what I would do if it where my child or my dad.If your dad says you are overreacting, tell him it is because you love him and tell him that you need to do this.I am sorry that I cannot share any related personal experiences with you.I am certain that you will receive very helpful comments by others, possibly those who have undergone a similar procedure.",

            "answer": "Hello Ozone,I'm also a volunteer, and am a long-time diabetic about your dad's age.I have learned that it's important for us to be followed by an ophthalmologist who specializes in care of diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0Altho' I long thought that an ophthalmogist is specialty enough, I've come to learn that there are specialties within that.\u00a0\u00a0When a diabetic's eys are evaluated by a physician who sees hundreds of diabetic eyes and works on hundreds of diabetic eyes, we are benefitting from deep experience.I have some \"internet pals\" who have had vitreous surgeries with very good outcomes.\u00a0\u00a0Pre-surgery consultation has always included discussions about other conditions and a detailed list of all medications, vitamins, supplements, herbs, etc. that the person takes.\u00a0\u00a0The anesthesia choice is an important one, and is made by considering many factors including health conditions and medications, etc.Read up on the underlying condition and the recommended surgery at reputable sites such as this one:http://www.nei.nih.gov/neitrials/viewStudyWeb.aspx?id=56As a person your dad's age, I can say I'd welcome the *informed* involvement of any family member, but can become frustrated when well-meaning, but uninformed folks tell me what to do or to be concerned about.\u00a0\u00a0You're clearly in the group of family members who're looking to inform yourself and, unless your dad is too frightened to talk about all this, I imagine he'll be relieved to have an informed conversation with you & to have you participate with him in quizzing & deciphering info from his docs.Good luck to you both!\u00a0\u00a0Your dad is lucky to have you in his court.",

    "question": "my dad has type 1 diabetes and he has been diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy, he is 50 years old with high blood pressure. he is thinking about having a vitrectomy surgery on his right eye, I am worried about him having to use anesthsia in his surgery and dont want him to have any complications especially with his heart by having a seizure. the surgery is going to be done under local anesthesia probably also with sedetive medication. I was wondering if anyone could tell me anything about local anesthesia or about sedetive medication, and about the success rate of both and any possible complications. I am really worried and anything could help thank you who ever can help and God bless.",
