            "answer": "Hi,Coenzyme Q10 or CoQ10 is produced by the human body and is needed for the basic functioning of cells. However, the amount decreases with age and is low in patients with some chronic diseases such as heart conditions, muscular dystrophies, Parkinson's disease, cancer, diabetes, and HIV. Levels of CoQ10 in the body can be increased by taking CoQ10 supplements, although safety and effectiveness have not always been proven.Side effects are typically mild and brief, and these may include ausea, vomiting, stomach upset, heartburn, diarrhea, loss of appetite, skin itching, rash, insomnia, headache, dizziness, itching, irritability, increased light sensitivity of the eyes, fatigue, or flu-like symptoms.Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "I have my mother taking cq10 for a few years now. I am not sure if it is helping. Of course she is only taking 100mg per day. She is 93 and has CHF. I heard a talk show this last sunday in which that host told a caller to take 400 to 600mg per day. The caller had the same problem my mother has, edema. Swelling of the ankles. I was all set to tell my mother to increase the dose till I did a little research. I googled cq10. Mostly positive comments. However, there was one negative comment that said if you are currently taking a statin drug, it could do more harm . The person stated that cq10 dimishes the effect of the statin drug, thereby increasing the chance of further congestive heart failure damage. So I didn't tell my mother. The show did mention another supplement called\u00a0\u00a0D-Ribos. I haven't had time to research it. Hope this helps a little.",
