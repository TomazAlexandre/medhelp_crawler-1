            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Suboxone is unlikely to cause Tinnitus. The ringing sound you hear is called Tinnitus. It occurs with disorders affecting the external, the middle or the inner ear. In the outer ears cerumen impaction or external otitis, in the middle ear fluid collection or\u00a0\u00a0disease of the tympanic membrane and in the inner ear damage to the nerve endings can cause tinnitus. As a result of these disorders the external sounds are masked leading to awareness of normal body sounds.\u00a0\u00a0You will need to consult your primary care physician for further evaluation, who may then refer you to an ENT specialist. An ENT examination, auditory brain stem response (ABR), a computerized test of the hearing nerves and brain pathways and CT/MRI brain may be needed to diagnose the cause for tinnitus. Treatment lies in treating the underlying cause.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Thank you sooo much for a thorough response.....Yes!!\u00a0\u00a0All you said is true!!\u00a0\u00a0Though there has been no diagnosis. I had an MRI/MRA of the brain and its all negative, thank god. My hearing is perfect, still buzzing on and off! Whoosing sounds in the left ear. They say its pulsatile tinnitus, but i still want a further diagnosis, of to WHY its happening. I may not get that. AND....it just may not be the Suboxone. I'm now on 2mg, trying so hard to get off it. It's a very unhealthy drug, yet saved my life, and worked it's purpose. I am also on Topamax, which I am getting off of as well. They did recommend to other tests to make me feel better..tests of the arteries ....Now, I can't remember the name. My anxiety is high, and I try not to think its something bad. I exercise a lot, eat well, quit smoking 5 years ago, and was once anemic, which could cause a Venus Hum. I have not tried all the other stuff you mentioned. Thank you. I was going to go to a Vascular Doctor because when I put my finger on my carotid artery, I scan stop the whooshing. And the whooshing only happens when I move in positions. Bending over, turning head...etc....... Thanks so much...Look forward to hearing from you, the doctors are not too helpful at times.......",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Good to see that you have been thoroughly investigated. The study of the vessels could be a doppler study. This helps to assess the vessels and the velocity of flow. Pulsatile tinnitus is a rhythmic pulsing sound that sometimes occurs in time with the heartbeat. It is usually associated with atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis, a disease where the 'fatty' material in the blood gets deposited in the walls of the blood vessels. Certain conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking and sedentary lifestyle promote this. Controlling diabetes and hypertension and following good lifestyle measures can help control calcification. Regular exercise and avoiding fatty foods can help to increase the flow through the arteries.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hmm...well i definatley dont have a sedentary lifestyle, no smoking, cholesterol is 120, blood pressure, 114/60...soooo I think health wise okay.....I am down to 2mg of the Suboxone, and the lower I go , it's odd the ears seem to start opening odd, the whooshing gets a little better. It would be fascinating if this was the cause. Though these withdrawls here are now slight, stomach cramping, sweats, restless less, etc..... I have a good addiction specialist I'm working with, but at times you question whats going on.\u00a0\u00a0Are you familiar with taking vitamins for the ears?\u00a0\u00a0I take Niacin, a Lypofaminoid, LBC Complex...Please excuse spelling typing fast and in a hurry......Homeopathic herbs to.....Thanks again.....:)",
