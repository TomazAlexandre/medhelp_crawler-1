    "question": "I have felt off balance for 7 months.\u00a0\u00a0Like on a boat rocking back and forth or front to back. Never any spinning type dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms are every day, but seem to be worse as the day progresses.\u00a0\u00a0Some days are worse than others.\u00a0\u00a0I have been to the ENT, Eye Doctor and the Neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0Had MRI done. No tumor or MS.\u00a0\u00a0Had ENG for the ear. They could induce some spinning type dizziness with that test, but meclizine and the head turning exercises have not helped.\u00a0\u00a0All the specialists seem to think it is my ear, except for the ENT who thinks something else is going on.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what to do next and none of the doctors seem to have any suggestions.\u00a0\u00a0It seems the \"off balance\" symptoms have made me more fatigued and I have been having some limited short term memory problems.\u00a0\u00a0I have quit working. (I was in the health care field and was worried I might injure a patient with being off balance and with the memory problems)",
