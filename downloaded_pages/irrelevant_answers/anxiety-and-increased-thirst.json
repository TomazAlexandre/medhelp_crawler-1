            "answer": "When your anxiety is at a high, you notice things that you do where your like, \"Wait a minute! This has never happened to me before!\" and then you obsess over it making the condition even worse. The more you dwell on it, the more your going to suffer from it. You're going to notice your body doing a lot of wierd things. Trust me. I had times where for a whole week I had to **** insanely like every hour or two, etc., then as soon as I stopped diagnosing myself with diabetes, I just said what the hell and just pissed whenever I had to and it just vanished after a week. I went from peeing 5-6 times a day to like 14 times a day for a week and then back to 5-6 times and then it never happened agian. Anxiety is laughing at all of us.You need to be careful though. Don't drink to much water in a short amount of time. You can kill yourself and that's not a myth.",

            "answer": "Anxiety can cause excessive thirst (although your stomach will feel full with anxiety attack) but other serious conditions like Diabetes also cause excessive thirst in which your thirst hardly quenches. So please get yourself tested for Diabetes .. if test appears negative, then your case should be anxiety disorder.",

            "answer": "It is anxiety. Don't scare the girl portzer, she said only in the evenings. If it was throughout the whole day from 12:00 am till 12:00 am then you would have problems but maybe. Just because someone is thirsty doesn't mean they are diabetic lol. There are a lot of earlier signs that come with the excessive thirst. Anxiety makes you constantly sweat if you have that sympton which makes you thirsty also.But because it only happens at a specific time and when your anxious.. it's your mind. The only thing you can do is get meds or ignore it. If you need xanax for severe panic attacks, then you should be on some type of anti depressant. Your whole life will pick up agian if you give them a chance.Whenever I get anxious like if I have to present a project, I ALWAYS have a bottle of water with me and I normally drink the whole damn thing when I'm presenting.. why? I have no idea.. I would freak out if I was drinking when I was nervous infront of people.Just stay strong. You know your body better than we do.",
