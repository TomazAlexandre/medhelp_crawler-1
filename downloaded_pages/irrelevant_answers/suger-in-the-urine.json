You need to provide more details in order to get an appropriate response. For the last test you just didn't wait long enough. Sugar peaks 2-4 hours after consumption.Your fasting glucose are within the normal range so why all the urine testing? Are you aware that urinalysis dipsticks have major disadvantages and may not be accurate?",

    "question": "I have recently analized my urine with urinalysis stix and found there to be lots of glucose (glycosuria). on repeating the test several times later on the same day - negative. without any glucose. I underwent a fasting blood glucose test which showed a level of 5.3 mmol/l (95.4 mg/dl). today on testing my urine about 30 mins after 250ml of coke and 3 sweet biscuits there was NO glucose in the urine. Can anyone explain why the first test was positive?",
