I had one incident last year where I woke up, tested - it showed 40, but I remember seeing 60. I took my Lantus (long acting) and proceeded to \"fall asleep\" on my desk in the study - at least that's what the kids thought. They know better now. I \"woke up\" on the floor under my desk 7+ hours later with my sugar at 36ish. I got lucky. :-) I woke up with my step-daughter's stuffed puppy in my arms, so she was thinking of me...",

    "question": "Hi. I've had Type I Diabetes for over 37 years now - I was around 3 when i came down with it.\u00a0\u00a0My question is for other long term Diabetics. I've noticed over the years that my hypoglycemic reaction symptoms have changed - generally dramatically - at stages of my life. When I was young, I hallucinated. The next incarnation was paralysis of all muscle groups including vocal - I figured it was my body's way of shutting down unnecessary parts in order to keep working. Luckily I was able to scream MOM when I realized it was happenning, although the first time was pretty scary for my parents.I've been thru the sweats and trembling. The last incarnation was just to pass out - thank God that's done (I hope). The latest I've seen was to get nauseous - which is eerily similar to my high sugar symptoms. Makes it very difficult to motivate eating at that point.Has anyone else seen consistent patters. or understands why a type of symptoms would reoccur for a period, and then change?",
