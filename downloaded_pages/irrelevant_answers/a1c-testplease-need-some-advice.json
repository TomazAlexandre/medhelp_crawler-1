            "answer": "The A1c has been used for more than 25 years as the major measure of glucose control and to establish targets for diabetes therapy. The findings of a recent large study have confirmed what smaller studies have shown that A1C really does represent an average glucose because we now have a reliable formula to convert A1C into average glucose [eAG = estimated Average Glucose]. Until labs provide patients eAG results use this formula to convert your A1c to eAG.eAG(mg/dl) = (28.7 x A1c) \u2013 46.7eAG(mmol/l) = (1.59 \u00d7 A1C) \u2212 2.59",

            "answer": "Very interesting. My understanding of the OGTT is that you are supposed to test at a couple points before two hours and then at two hours. For some of us, our blood sugar returns to normal after 3 hours. Well, you will see what the A1C and other tests show. I hope you get some answers to how you are feeling soon.
