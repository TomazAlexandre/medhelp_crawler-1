            "answer": "My best advice as a long-time diabetic with no complications is to test every 2-3 hours and adjust according to the numbers you see. If your sugar goes up to over 200 and STAYS there, that's when damage is done. If it pops up high, but you catch it quickly and add a few units of quick-acting insulin to normalize it quickly, damage is much less likely to happen. I was diagnosed at age 12 and I turn a ripe almost-old 50 tomorrow. No complications and perfect health. Just adjust often so high and low numbers can't stay high or low for very long and your body is protected. A quick swing up or down is not likely to harm you -- it is when that high or low stays high or low that the damage is done.",

Thank you!!",

    "question": "I've had diabetes for six years and i'm 20 yrs old now.\u00a0\u00a0I have tryed to control it the best i can and it still runs in the 200 range sometimes. I've taken Lantus since i have had it and i just started taking Novolog which has helped a lot! I always here about ppl and the complacations that they end up getting after they have had diabetes for awhile and im starting to get upset and scared because i dont want to go blind, get my feet amputated or have kidney failure.\u00a0\u00a0It just seems to happen to so many diabetics and im scared that one day it will happen to me.\u00a0\u00a0Im the first person to ever have diabetes in my family so they dont know how scary it is.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to live to be old and not die from complacations. If my sugers go to 200 and something 4 or 5 times a week is that mean that im taking bad care of it or that im a higher risk for complacations??",
