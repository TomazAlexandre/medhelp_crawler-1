    "question": "My grandma has been recently diagnosed with Diabetes. She has started to give herself shots. This past weekend she was taken to the hospital complaining of her chest hurting. They told her she had some stomach acid something with gastric reflux and they also mentioned nerve endings (I don't know why). My aunt asked me to find information about what she has. I have done searches and all that has come up are stuff about heartburn (which she gets ever so often). They also gave my aunt a medical term of what she has but she has neglected to give it to me for the time being. I was wondering if anybody has heard of this or if they know what is going on. She never use to have this problem until she was disgnosed with diabetes. Anything will help. Thank you.",
