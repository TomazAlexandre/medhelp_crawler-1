            "answer": "Lucian,Welcome to this site.\u00a0\u00a0I can only speak for myself ... as a DMer for more than 30 years now.\u00a0\u00a0I firmly believe that a cure will be found in my lifetime.\u00a0\u00a0I know how much better my own disease management is now compared to my initial diagnosis ... Why is it better?\u00a0\u00a0Research resulted in advances, and yes -- I made the personal commitment to using those results.One of the things that gives me great hope for a CURE is the breadth & depth of research & interest in finding the cure(s) for diabetes & its complications (as a matter of fact, that's the only Mission of JDRF == as I understand it, when that goal is reached they'll all happily dissolve the organization & individually find other endeavors).\u00a0\u00a0I often read the research info on the JDRF website .. particularly those articles written for lay folks like us.I've also attended a few research updates and am amazed at both the complexity and the progress.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps it's that complexity that gives us all some worry that \"maybe it can't be done?\"While I know that *I* can't do, I do know that it WILL be done.What are your perspectives?",

            "answer": "LucianI have had diabetes since I was 11 years now and I am now 18. Let me just start off by saying that I am a firm believer in a cure coming in my lifetime. I recently went to the annual meeting for the JDRF chapter in my area and heard of some exciting new research. You should check on their website for that.Also I do not know if you know, but 257 people have been cured with islet cell transplantation. Using the Edmonton Protocol pioneered in Canada. There are various centers throughout the world who are doing islet cell translplants. The problem is that the anti-rejections drugs have side effects that some physicians say are worse than complications that Diabetes Mellutis (DM).In my opinion YES there will be a cure for type 1 diabetes!!pumpgirl03",
