    "question": "Hi,With the current economy being as it is, its hard enough for the time being for my parents to make ends meet with a child who requires so much medical attention as a child with type 1 diabetes. They really need help, info, suggestions, ect on what they can do for medical help with my little brother who is now 17. Its no question that my parents will do all they can to do to take care of his medical needs first and foremost before any bill they have, as they always have, but they really need assistance. He is currently covered under my mothers work heath insurance but he is on a insulin pump and co-pay is still VERY pricey. Right now a major concern they also have is what options will be available for my brother when he is no longer covered under my parents health insurance and he is a college student himself trying to make ends meet. I know there must be something someone knows that can help one way or another. Any advice please?",
