            "answer": "It does get easier. I have been diabetic for the last 14 years now. For the first month after I found out, I would not give myself a shot. My sister was giving me shots whenever i needed them. Then I felt comfortable with it.I do have drinks. I enjoy couple of glasses of wine with my dinner. I used to go out with my friends for beer occasionally, I just don't get trashed. I am not into hard liquors.You being a teenager you might want to wait to find out how alcoholic beverages affect you.Most important thing for you is don't FORGET TO TAKE YOUR INSULIN , TAKE TOO MUCH OF IT and listen to your bodys' signals.Get a good doctor, Check your A1C once every three month. You will learn to manage it.Good luck",

            "answer": "look, i'm not gonna lie to you......having diabetes sucks,especially as a teenager. i'm 27 and was diagnosed\u00a0\u00a0when i was 13. here's the thing, checking your blood sugar is always probably gonna be a little annoying but you do get used to it and with needles as small as they are now they definitely make it easier. as for the shots, you really do get used to them. i've been giving myself mine from the very beginning but that's not the case for everyone. sometimes the shots will hurt in a specific spot for no apparent reason, but that's not the norm and eventually they're just what you do like brushing your teeth or something they're part of your routine......as for the drinking, well i've never been a drinker but each time i have drank it totally messes up my blood sugar and seriously makes me feel pretty crappy and a massive headache, and that's not even getting drunk",

    "question": "hi im new to the whole diabetes thing, its been 3 weeks about, my friends are kind of the party group, i kno that drinking is bad for it because when i was younger a neighbor had to be rushed to the hopsital because he drank alot at a party and had type 1 diabetes and from what i was told nearly lost his life..... so i was thinking of just smoking marijuana occasionally but was wondering the dangers besides just getting the munchies.so my questions are1. Dangers of smoking marijuana with diabetes besides just munchies ( such as blood sugar levels and such)2. does it honestly get easier, right now after 3 weeks its still just as like painful for me to be pricking my finger non stop and taking shots.... ive been told it gets easier but only by people who dont even have diabetes and my mother who has it but only tells me what i want to hear.3. how bad is drinking honestly w/ diabetes? i was told by people that you just cant get drunk but you can still like have a beer or two or somethingnow i kno the first solution to all of this is just not to do them... but im being completely honest, im a teenager. and at my high school this really is what people do every weekend. so insteand of just going out and doing these things i figured i would see others experiences and advice first.thank you all so muchim so glad i found this site.Dan",
