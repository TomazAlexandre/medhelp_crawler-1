    "question": "Hi!I really hope someone can help! I am 17, and have been experiencing some odd symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I was having muscle aches in one leg and sometimes (rarely) that leg would give out and I would fall.\u00a0\u00a0Also some nubness, pins and needles ect. physically tired after little exerciseSo I went to the doctor and they did blood work which came back normal and I was told to come back for more testsThe next day I was EXHAUSTED!\u00a0\u00a0I slept for two days straight and was really weak.\u00a0\u00a0I had trouble getting to the bathroom about ten feet away and had practically no use of my legs!\u00a0\u00a0When I would stand up I would almost faint, tunnel vision, heart pounding ect. and my legs would just give out!Then I got better withing a couple days and after a few more days of a little weakness I was completely symptom free.\u00a0\u00a0I didnt go back to the doctor as told because I felt so good...So I went two or three months feeling great! But then, I got sick again.\u00a0\u00a0This is the first day I have been able to function! I had the same symptoms as the last \"episode\" except the weakness was a tiny bit less severe (I could get to the bathroom with only a couple breaks.)\u00a0\u00a0but it lasted a whole five days and I am still pretty weak!I will be going back to the doctor soon but I just wanted anyones thoughts on what could be wrong?",
