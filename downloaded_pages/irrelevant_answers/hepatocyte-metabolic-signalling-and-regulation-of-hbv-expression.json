            "answer": "Simvastatin is contraindicated in pregnancy and liver disease, according to Wikipedia. I also know that Cresor 40mg is not recommended for Asians. I would like to know why you believe simvastatin and or statin in geneal have ant-hbv activities? Have you heard of cases where statins cause acute liver failure in chronic hbv patients?Cheers,Stephen",

            "answer": "there are trials already i posted in the past, also the effect of sim on liver was reviwed by liver researchers and they said it has no toxicity the elevations of alt that can happen on few are due to a balance of lipids not toxicity because the alt elevation is transient and resolve itselfthe only serious side effect of sim that can happen is muscle damage or mitocondrial discorder, very rarestatins cause acute liver failure in chronic hbv patients?no never heard, statins have been used on cirrhosis patients (no more healthy liver left) and the results have been alt lowering and hcc preventionthe problem wth statins is that they are supercheap since generics from many years, some incompetent doctors try to say those things without trials to prove or studies to try to change sim with new patented drugs....check for liver researchers and statins, the studies were from 2009 conferences and bader is the one studying sim for hbv and hcv.it is know sim has also an effect on immune system and is used on hcv with interferon and vitamin d to increase svrthe drugs not used yet are antidiabetes but researchers in florence, close to my hospital, said that they are very useful for HCC prevention or cure.avantia should not be used to to severe sides effects but actos should be safe engouh, in any case i suggest the use of sim with blood checks every month but not antidiabetes",

            "answer": "Many many thanks for the references. The one from Lancet is most re-assuring. The message I get is that at very high dosage of Statin, maybe liver function should be monitored for liver patients. This agreed with my doctor's assurance about Crestor at 10mg. The case of acute liver failure I know of is suspected but not confirmed.Thanks again,Stephen",

            "answer": "if you have cholesterol problems do use sim or lobastatin or red yeast (which contains lobastatin naturally), all these have studies of lowering hbsag, and this is also logical since hbsag is made of lipids/cholesteroltorvastatin and fluvastatin (or similar names) have no or little effect on hbsag/hbvthis is another post i made time agohttp://www.medhelp.org/posts/Hepatitis-B/finally-found-a-study-on-hbv-and-cholesterol/show/1317387i also posted an article on envelopped viruses and cholesterol time ago but now i have no time to look for it.it was made on hiv, herpes and others which are same family/similar to hbvthey saw that these viruses have missing parts/incomplete virions after there is no cholesterol available and less infectivity",

The emerging principle of the intimate link between HBV and liver metabolism can be further exploited for host-targeted therapeutic strategies.",
