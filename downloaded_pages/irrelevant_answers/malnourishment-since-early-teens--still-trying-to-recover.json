            "answer": "Hi!Well, to gain weight, you need to increase your protein and carbohydrate component of meal and eat healthy fat in moderate amount. You should continue to eat fruits and vegetables. Calculate your BMR from any calculator on the net and plan out a diet chart based on the required calorie count. You can choose your own options from various free calorie counters. MedHelp too has these calorie counters. You can track your weight on MedHelp too.Other than this diabetes, hyperthyroidism, gut problems causing poor absorption and worms in stool all cause weight loss or could be responsible for your inability to gain weight. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I'm 19, 5\"3, and weigh maybe 89 Ibs. I'll be brief. I have a lot of responsibilities and haven't been able to maintain a diet stable enough to gain weight (I can't gain weight off of unhealthy junk food for example. And I can't eat 3 large meals a day or it will disrupt my digestive system- I have to multiple medium sized meals each day for my digestive to function properly). Any advice on weight gain? I can eat the same meal multiple times a day and wouldn't mind the taste factor(bored of recipe); I just need something stable. Perhaps something I could cook in large quantities and eat throughout the week.Note: Lot of responsibilities= not much time to manage self health.",
