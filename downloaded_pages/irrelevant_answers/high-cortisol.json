            "answer": "Without knowing all three of your thyroid levels with Labs reference range, it is impossible for us laypersons to know what is going on with your thyroid via cortisol. From what I understand a high cortisol\u00a0\u00a0level\u00a0\u00a0are found in Cushing's syndrome,\u00a0\u00a0thyroid issues, obesity, ACTH-producing tumors, and high levels of stress. Chronically elevated cortisol levels lead to muscle loss, fat gain, immune suppression and reduced ability to repair tissue damage following intense workouts and these are just some of the effects.\u00a0\u00a0Prolonged stress and cortisol exposure can also damage heart and blood vessels, shrink brain cells, break down bone tissue and increase the risk of depression, diabetes and other illnesses.If you post all three of your thyroid levels with Labs reference range, will tell more of the story to what might be going on.GLI'm not a doctor,So please don't shoot the messenger!",

            "answer": "HiMy tsh was recently 1.7Antibodies negativeI am on Yasmin - I have had lots of hair loss all over scalp and some on brows - scalp burns and hurts very bad.Out of request I asked the endo to test my adrenals - he was very reluctant and stated that cushings would shock him - due to my slim frame. It came back double the normal in the am.\u00a0\u00a0I just finished a urine test should know next week.\u00a0\u00a0Also he did a 17 hyroprogesterone test that was normal.Was told that thyroid can cause elevated cortisol, wondering how elevated it can make it?Doctor does Cushings typically mean cortisol is elevated all the time morning, noon and night? Through Saliva mine drops to normal levels in the late afternoon and eveningThanks for your help.",

            "answer": "Not knowing your Labs reference range but using mine as reference, according to your TSH level does not indicate thyroid and is in normal\u00a0\u00a0range.\u00a0\u00a0Hypothyroid, I believe is low function.Normally cortisol levels rise during the early morning hours and are highest in midmorning (about 7 a.m.). They drop very low in the evening and during the early phase of sleep. However if you sleep during the day and are up at night the pattern may be reversed. The absence of this daily variation which is known as diurnal rhythm in cortisol levels may be one of the first signs of overactive adrenal glands, especially Cushing's syndrome.There are many ways to control cortisol levels and these strategies can simultaneously benefit health and performance.Eat a balanced diet, get adequate rest, and regular exercise can help the body adapt and respond to stressful events. Controlling individual stress responses with various relaxation techniques can help modulate cortisol secretion and normalize metabolism. Keep well hydrated. There is some recent science showing that dehydration causes cortisol levels to increase. Consume plenty of water.Good luck with your search!",
