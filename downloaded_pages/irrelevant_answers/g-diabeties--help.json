            "answer": "It's VERY common for a woman to fail the 1 hr and pass the 3 hr, it doesn't mean you have gestational diabetes, it just means your results came out high, if your results come out this high, then it's likely you have gestational diabetes. The test is the same thing as your previous one, just longer to see if your body breaks it down with a larger time frame (for some people it does), it's another blood test, you'll drink the drink and stay there for 3 hours this time, some places test your blood every hour, some only test once at the end of the 3 hours. If you do, it's not a huge deal and it's not too late, some women can regulate their sugar by just changing their diet. And it's nothing to feel bad about if you do have it, even women that eat healthily and do everything to prevent gestational diabetes can get it, it's something some women are prone to during pregnancy. Try not to stress about it until after you get the results back of your 3 hour, I'm sure everything will be fine! :)",
