            "answer": "Hi,Veltam is primarily used for benign prostatic enlargement which usually occurs in much older age group. I don\u2019t think you have got any evidence of prostate enlargement. A PVR volume of greater than 100 ml is generally accepted as the criterion to define incomplete bladder emptying. However, in your case it\u2019s only 14 ml which is absolutely normal. There\u2019s a possibility of chronic prostatitis/chronic cystitis (inflammation of the bladder). I\u2019ll suggest another urine culture and if that\u2019s negative, nothing much to worry on that front. Meanwhile, please do get a blood sugar done & rule out the possibility of diabetes mellitus which is an important cause of increased frequency of micturition. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
