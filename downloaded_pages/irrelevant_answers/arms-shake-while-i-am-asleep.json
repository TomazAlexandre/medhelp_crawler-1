            "answer": "My wife tells me I move around, not just my arms, but I guess all of me sometimes. I have no idea why other than I have very vivid nightmares.It's good you are seeing your doctor, hopefully before then, someone on here has the same thing and can help you out. If not, the doctor will.What I have noticed about this site, is people are not always on, so it might sometimes seem like your questions go unnoticed, but they are not ignored. It just might take a little while for someone to reply. There are so many people here who help and care. Please keep us posted on what it is. :-)",

Apart from restless leg syndrome, this could be partial focal epilepsy, involuntary muscle spasms, also. certain electrolyte disturbances can cause spasms like depletion of calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium etc and dehydration. diabetes, anemia, multiple sclerosis and spinal problems can also cause spasms. Consult a neurologist at the earliest to investigate these issues.Blood tests, electrolyte levels, EEG, MRI Spine and brain may help arrive at a diagnosis. Take care.",
