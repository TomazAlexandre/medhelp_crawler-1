            "answer": "Hello,Blood sugar of 115 could be \"somewhat normal\", depending on when you measured it.\u00a0\u00a0Blood sugar of 147 is not normal regardless of when you measured it.Truely normal fasting is in the low 80s, however most doctors will allow up to about 99, 100 - 126 is prediabetic, and >126 is overt diabetes.2 hours after eating target should be close to fasting if your blood sugar is normal, but always < 120, though some will allow <\u00a0\u00a0140.So you see your numbers are above normal.\u00a0\u00a0Safe numbers are normal numbers.Recommend you see your doctor for full check, including HBA1C.Then you should be adopting lower carbohydrate diet with portion control, daily aerobic exercise, and wieght loss to get you to your optimal weight.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know how tall you are, but 245 lbs sounds like you are probably overweight.Early type 2 diabetes can be reversed with diet, exercise and lifestyle measures.Early and agressive management will help prevent it progressing and the risk of full blow diabetes and complications.Hope this helps. Let us know how you go.",

            "answer": "The two basic test times to test your blood sugar are:1.)\u00a0\u00a0Fasting [8-10 hrs, no food or colored liquids, usually performed 1st thing in morning b4 breakfast] 60/70 to 99 mg/dl2.)\u00a0\u00a0Postprandial [2-3 hours after a meal] same as fasting 60/70 to 99 mg/dl. Usually 1 hour after eating blood sugars rarely exceed 140 mg/dl, and return to normal levels within 2-3 hours.If your test results during these time periods fall between 100 and 125 mg/dl you are considered prediabetic. Above 126 mg/dl is considered diabetes.As you can see having levels of \"always 115 to 147\" is not normal. Testing anytime is not a good idea as it fails to provide an accurate insight on your blood sugar levels. Also, be certain to sterilized your test site prior to using a lancet to avoid contamination, or you will end up with inaccurate results.Lastly, I suggest you see your doctor for an A1c [HbA1c, HgbA1c, HA1c] test. The A1c measures your blood sugars over the past 2-3 months and provides a better idea if you are a diabetes candidate or not. If your doctor verifies diabetes post back to this thread. We can further assist you with diabetic lifestyle changes one has to make in order to better control and manage your blood sugars. Good luck -",

            "answer": "@joyel - I eat dinner around the same too and used to get the hunger pains when I hit bed at 11 pm. Here's what I found that works for me; around 8, I may snack on nuts, or have a small bowl of low carb/no sugar O's, wheat shreds, or corn flakes topped with sugar free hemp milk. Or, one slice low carb [12g], 0 sodium, 0 sugar toasted whole wheatberry bread with pure peanut butter topped with sugar free jam. You'll feel satisfied w/o worry of raising blood sugars. Be sure to test your bedtime blood sugars. Going to bed with high levels means one-third of your day is spent with above normal levels. Good luck -",
