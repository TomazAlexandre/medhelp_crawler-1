            "answer": "I am in the same boat. I started pre pregnancy at 335lbs and I am 6 '4'. At my appointement on Dec 29th (almost 20 weeks) I had gained 20lbs. The doc told me I will be seeing a nutritionist after I give birth. I don't mind because I want to lose the weight. I weighed in this morning and I gained another 5lbs (I will be 22 weeks on Sunday). It is funny because I don't pig out........but I eat if I am hungry. I sometimes wait to the point that I get a headache then I know I have to eat something. I don't eat a lot of junk but if I have a craving I induldge. When I eat like fruit and vegetables all day I get a bad headache like it's a sign it is not enough for my body. I am really trying to watch what I eat but I think by my husband being 6'4' also and 300lbs I think a small baby is inevitable and all the weight is really not just me. But I guess docs only think about the ideal weight for pregnancy and stick to it.",

Perfect size, 2 days shy of due date.My doctors never said anything. I believe the baby will only gain what it is ment to as long as it isn't something like diabeties.\u00a0\u00a0The weight was hard to come off but it did with lots of work.This pregnancy I'm 23w2d and started at 170lbs (gained from last m/c) and I'm now 185.5 lbs. Since Christmas it has come on faster. But I also never had morning sickness or problems eating, where other may and lose weight first.Don't worry, just get your sugar checked and if it is okay I wouldn't stress about it.Best wishes",
