            "answer": "Sounds like you are dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0You probably have a vitamin D deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0Optimal level 50-80\u00a0\u00a0We cannot hydrate without minerals but if we have a D deficiency then the calcium doesn't know where to go and just flushes out. If you donot get 30 minutes of sun on 80 percent of your body, 3 times a week without sun screen or eat oily fish every day then you probably have a deficiency. Take 5000iu vitamin D softgels every day for proper D levels. It can take a few months to build up levels but you should start to feel better.\u00a0\u00a0Stay away from soda and caffeine",

    "question": "I've been having quite a few problems lately, I have alot of different symptoms such as dizziness, feeling weak, sometimes feeling a bit of vertigo, at times difficult to breathe. I'm not sure what's wrong with me I haven't got to a doctor yet due to no insurance, but it's getting so bad that I'm about to check myself into a hospital. Does anyone have any ideas on what I may have?",
