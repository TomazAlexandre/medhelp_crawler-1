Diet and Exercise may also play a part (but less so).What is your BMI? How much weight have you actally lost and over what length of time?If you feel you have lost weight then I would encourage you to see your Doctor to rule out possible physical causes such as Hyper-Thyroidism, Diabetes and Chronic Disease. This can be done by a simple blood test.If all is well you should keep a food diary (and exercise diary) for a couple of weeks and compare your calorie intake (and usage).

Usually your metabolism decreases throughout your life as you get older. Are you eating as much? Are you confident about your body? Is something troubling you? Are you exercising too much?

The best way to get best answers and advice is to seek professional answers. Good luck.",
