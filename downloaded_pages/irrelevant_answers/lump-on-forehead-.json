            "answer": "Hi!If the bump comes and goes and is not in the same place and comes only at night, then you probably have some water retention. It would be good to get kidney and liver functions assessed and rule out diabetes, thyroid disorders and adrenal gland dysfunction.Please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
