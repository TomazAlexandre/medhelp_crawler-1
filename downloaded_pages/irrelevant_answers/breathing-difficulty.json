            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.It could indicate a lower respiratory tract infection if it is accompanied by cough. It could also be due to Asthma or cardiac disorders. Certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause these symptoms. So please consult your primary care physician who may ask for an EKG or a treadmill test to rule out a cardiac cause for the pain. He may even ask for blood tests and an X ray chest. Lung function tests could further help in evaluation.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
