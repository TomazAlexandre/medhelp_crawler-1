            "answer": "Oh, so sorry to hear of your medical problems. I think you need to see a gastroenterologist. Your symptoms could be that of many gastrointestinal disorders. Have you been tested for diabetes? My Mom had diabetes and her only symptom was excessive thirst.\u00a0\u00a0 I cannot believe your doctor and the hospital are dismissing your symptoms without any further tests.I got Crohn's when I was 24 yrs old (now doing well at 63 yrs) and my only symptoms were excessive loss of weight and constant diarrhoea) down to 70 lbs. I had no pain initially.\u00a0\u00a0Took some 9 months and 5 different hospitals to diagnose Crohn's, but eventually we got there. My bp was 80 over 45, which was exceptionally low.Your symptoms are serious and you need some answers, but those of us on here who post are not doctors, just concerned people wishing to help others with problems.Please go back to your doctor and ask for a consultation with a gastroenterologist.Take care,Liz.",
