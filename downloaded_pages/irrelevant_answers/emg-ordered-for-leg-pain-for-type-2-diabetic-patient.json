            "answer": "Your labs sound fairly normal. The T4 is in the lower end of normal and along with the T3U (not a lab I use that often) being a little high suggests a trend towards hypothyroid -- but the TSH is perfect.\u00a0\u00a0I know you have had lots of tests recently -- if you are on synthroid (or levothyroxine or levoxyl) -- it may be worthwhile waiting 4 weeks and rechecking TSH, free T4 and free T3 to see if there is a trend developing the means you need a higher dose.",

    "question": "I have been diagnosed type 2 diabetic for about 20 years, insulin dependent for last 5.\u00a0\u00a0Recently I changed primary physicians when I moved to FL and discovered that my blood sugar levels have not been as well controlled by my former doctor as they should have been.\u00a0\u00a0Now they are well controlled with combination of Novolin N and glucophage I also take accupril for hypertension daily.\u00a0\u00a0I have severe pain in my legs, numbness in my toes and feet and aching in my knees and hips.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is present when I rest as well as when I exercise.\u00a0\u00a0I had an arterial Doppler study and an MRA before being referred to vascular surgeon who advised me that he did not feel surgery was a good option at this time.\u00a0\u00a0My primary physician has now referred me to the Mayo Clinic and, after my first visit when they examined the results of my Doppler and MRA they want to do an EMG.\u00a0\u00a0What kinds of neurological disorders can cause the symptoms I am experiencing and is it wise to look at neurological causes for my symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0Since I am a novice at all of this, I would appreciate any advice I can receive as to what kinds of other questions I should ask the doctors.\u00a0\u00a0It is a long trip to the Clinic and I want to make the best use of the time I am spending there and come back with the best answers I can get.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
