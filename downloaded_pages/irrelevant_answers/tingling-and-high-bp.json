            "answer": "Hello,Considering your age and the rise in BP, it is better to get a through checkup done from a physician.\u00a0\u00a0Any type of tingling, burning, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a sensory nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol? Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism.They can also occur in peripheral artery disease, Peripheral nerve trauma, Peripheral nerve compression or in head injury patients.Firstly, I\u2019ll request you to get your blood sugar/HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) tested to rule out Diabetes mellitus. You may also need tests like Nerve Conduction Velocity etc.My opinion is to get yourself examined by a neurologist. After confirmatory diagnosis only, treatment can be started. I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

Nape pain, dizziness and neurological symptoms such as what happened may be related to your increased blood pressure. You need a complete work-up, as mentioned above, to determine the underlying cause. Your usual blood pressure readings, your medical history, family history and diagnostic tests including blood chemistry,\u00a0\u00a0ECG and imaging studies may also be indicated. Try to monitor your blood pressure daily. Eat a low salt diet and exercise regularly. Take care and do keep us posted.",
