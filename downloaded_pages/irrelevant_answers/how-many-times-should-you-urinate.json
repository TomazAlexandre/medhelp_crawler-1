            "answer": "Thanks very much for your reply. It's strange because I have been off antibiotics for 4 weeks now.I do actually feel thirsty and not just a dry mouth. I don't have dry eyes. I do get quite frequent headaches but I think they are sinus related.But as you say maybe it could just be a dry mouth making me feel like I'm thirsty and no doubt the anxiety isn't doing it any good.If I went back to my doctor what other tests could I get done? I just feel stuck about the situation really.Many thanks",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Antibiotics often disturb the gut and mouth flora and cause some acidity. This can make you feel thirsty. Naturally, if you drink water more, you will urinate more.Take some probiotics and antacids for 2-3 days. See if this helps. Increase your intake of soups, lemonade, juice, fruits, and vegetables\u2014do not go overboard\u2014a slight increase will help.Watch for 2-3 days with this treatment and routine.Also try and take up walking or any other exercise, and listen to music, go for yoga, or any other stress busters. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi guys,I am a 20 year old male and I have anxiety issues which flare up and down.After taking a course of antibiotics 4-5 weeks ago I began to feel really thirsty with a dry mouth. I consumed lots of water and urinated lots. My anxiety kicked in and I thought I had diabetes, so I went to see my doctor who ordered a full fasting blood test. I had the blood test done and the results came back that everything was fine.Now this just doesn't match my symptoms... Even now I still feel constantly thirsty with a dry mouth and I still feel like I'm consuming last of water because of it. I'm not sure if it's anxiety or something more.Yesterday I logged how many times I urinated and in total it was 13 times, roughly every hour.Please could anyone shed some light on what could be going on here?Thanks",
