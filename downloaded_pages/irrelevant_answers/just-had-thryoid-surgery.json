            "answer": "You should start your meds again after your doctor has run a TSH test, as well as free T3 and free T4. He really needs to know what your levels are before putting you on medication. You may not need any at this point.Oh, if you had a severe thyroid storm, as you stated in your other thread, you would be dead. You had severe tachacardia from being Hyper.Maybe you need a new doctor?Not really enough information to provide the exact, correct answer.Demand tests.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Please, please get to an endocrinologist!\u00a0\u00a0Most regular doctors don't know how to treat thyroid conditions.\u00a0\u00a0Check and make sure the endo is a thyroid specialist - many only treat diabetes.It is unusual for someone to have a reaction to the synthetic thyroid - usually it's the fillers.\u00a0\u00a0If that happens then you are switched to a different brand.\u00a0\u00a0 You do need to be on thyroid meds after surgery.",

            "answer": "I too just recently had a total thyroidectomy on Dec 6th and I was on 25mcg on synthroid after surgeryand went now to a 162mcg and I have a appointment on the 28th to see again where my levels are at, It is a kind of slow process so be patient, it's hard to be I know, I was hyperthyroid as well your adjustments have to be done slowly your Dr started you on to high of a dose too quick your TSH numbers will keep changeing to a more hypo state as your numbers lower he will have to keep adjusting you to whatever number works best for you and your medication will be adjusted every 4 weeks because it will take that long for your body to absorb it completely and then get re-tested again, and yes I agree totally with the other comments that were written to you go see an ENDOCRINOLOGIST!!!! your regular Dr does not know what he is doing.....",
