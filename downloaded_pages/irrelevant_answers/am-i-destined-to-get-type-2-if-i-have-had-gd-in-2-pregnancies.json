            "answer": "Hi,The data that we have available does show that gestational diabetes puts you at risk for diabetes in future, overall. I can't say definitely \"yes or no\" if that won't happen with some good dietary and exercise habits--most likely those healthy lifestyle habits will help ward off future type 2 diabetes but it is not 100% either way.\u00a0\u00a0If you desire a third child, I suggest you try to be at optimal weight prior to trying to conceive and be followed closely during the pregnancy for any glucose changes that may occur. You should also try to be followed by a high risk obstetrician who is familiar with gestational diabetes.Good luck, congratulations on your pregnancy and take care of yourself and baby.",

    "question": "I am currently 27 weeks PG and was dx with gd for the second time at 24 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I was\u00a0\u00a0overweight before either PG, exercised and ate fairly well. If I continue to stay fit after delivery will I def get type 2 later in life? Should my recurrent GD be a factor in deciding to have a 3rd baby? Does the more times I get it increase the chances of type 2? It is so frustrating b/c I really ave always been thin and did not even gain much weight with my PG. Thanks",
