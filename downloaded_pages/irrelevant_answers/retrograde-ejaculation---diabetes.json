    "question": "if I try sudafed to solve the problem, is it something I take a few hours before sex or is it something that must be taken daily?\u00a0\u00a0Am I mistaken that phenylpropanolamine was taken off the market? If so, what is the most common med given for this problem.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, I find that semen slowly oozes out a couple of minutes after ejaculating.\u00a0\u00a0Is this also consistent with retrograde ejaculation?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
