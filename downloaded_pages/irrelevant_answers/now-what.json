            "answer": "Hi,Diabetes can also cause pain in calves and feet and tingling numbness. I hope a blood sugar test was also done to rule out diabetes.Obesity can also cause pain in the calves and feet due to increased pressure on legs, though I am not sure if that\u2019s the case with you.I would suggest that you also get an Xray or a CT scan of your lower back done to rule out nerve compression at that level. Good luck!",

    "question": "I posted my symptoms the other day, been happening since February: numbness & tingling various parts of the body, feet, legs, hands, arms, face, head, muscle spasms throughout different parts of my body.\u00a0\u00a0Went through the initial tests of CT of my head, x-rays of my cervical spine, then MRI (with and without contrast) on my head and cervical spine.\u00a0\u00a0Went to the doctor yesterday, and basically he told me all they found was a couple of discs (cervical) out of alignment.\u00a0\u00a0I can understand that affecting my head and arms, but not my feet and legs.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor said I may have problems in my lumber spine also, but no further tests suggested.\u00a0\u00a0The weird thing is I told him most of the consistent problems seem to be pain in my calves and feet (like I've run a marathon), something like RLS.\u00a0\u00a0I can't take certain meds because of liver disease, so he prescribed aspirin therapy for now.\u00a0\u00a0We'll see how that works.\u00a0\u00a0If not, I guess I will speak to my PCD and see what else I can do and if there are any meds I can take to relieve the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions from anyone out there?",
