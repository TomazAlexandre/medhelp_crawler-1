Post eating should be < 120.I think you should take your results and go see your dr justa s soon as you can get in.To assist things you should lose weight if you are overweight, adopt a low carb, moderate protein, high (healthy) fats diet, and exercise as much as y you can.\u00a0\u00a0You can use your new meter to see what your numbers are after eating different meals and then use what you learn to adjust your diet.With blood sugars this high your dr will very likely start you on medications.",

    "question": "Hello everyone, I bought a meter and test strips because of a general lack of energy and really wanted to see what my numbers looked like. Before lunch about an 2 hours after some coffee with cream and surgar I got a 163. Then about an hour and a half after lunch (2 tuna fish sandwiches) I got a 239. Now a few hours later a I'm back at 160. I was going to log things for a week and bring it to my doctor to look at.Question is, after reading this forum for a while I can see my numbers are pretty high. Any suggestions",
