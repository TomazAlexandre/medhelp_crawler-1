So both are tests for glasses but little else. So if all you're interested in is testing for glasses than go to WalMarts.If the \"eye clinic\" is a Eye MD physician-ophthalmologist then you are getting a complete medical eye examination for eye diseases and an exam for systemic disease like diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid eye disease, etc by a MD with a minimum of 8 years training after getting a university degree.NEVER LOOK FOR BARGAINS IN PARACHUTES AND EYE EXAMINATIONS.jch MD",
