            "answer": "Hi Steveman,Here's a site that shows the \"action\" of different types of insulin; by that I mean it shows the onset, peak & normal duration of each type of insulin.http://diabetes.about.com/library/blbasics/bl_insulin_action_chart.htmA useful way to think about \"what types of insulin are good for me,\"\u00a0\u00a0is to remember that we all need both long-acting (basal) and short-acting (bolus) insulin.\u00a0\u00a0When you talk to your doctor about lifestyle issues s/he can\u00a0\u00a0help you tailor a diabetes treatment plan that most closely matches your preferences.\u00a0\u00a0Important considerations include diet/food patterns (are you a nibbler or do you like a few big meals), activity/exerice, blood testing commitments (1-2 times a day? 5-6 times a day?), and -- quite frankly, your budget & insurance situation.Some treatment options are not covered by all insurers and are very expensive to manage without insurance.This site has many references to insulin pump (and pen) websites. If you scroll down, you'll see the websites for major pump mfgs and even a comparison page.http://insulin-pumpers.org/links.shtmlYou know the recommendation here.\u00a0\u00a0Keep up your research, learn a lot, and then, armed with information & questions, talk with your endo and CDE (certified diabetes educator) to customize your DM management.\u00a0\u00a0You can also expect that your needs will change over time as you move thru stages in life and as you acquire new interests and activities ... and, of course, as technology & research advances our abilities to care well for ourselves.",

            "answer": "Steve, here is what I know about insulins and insulin pumps.\u00a0\u00a0Please consult your doctor for more details:Insulins:Novolog (aspart),onset 5-10 mins, peak 1-3 hrs, duration 3-5 hrsHumalog (lispro), onset <15 mins, peak .5-1.5 hrs, duration 2-4Regular, onset .5-1 hour, peak 2-3 hrs, duration 3-6 hoursNPH, onset 2-4 hrs, peak 4-10 hrs, duration 10-16 hoursLente, onset 3-4 hrs, peak 4-12 hrs, duration 12-18 hoursUltralente, onset 6-10 hrs, peak ----, duration 18-20 hoursLantus (glargine), onset 1.1 hour, peak ----, duration 24 hoursThere are also several mixes but not usually used for Type 1.Insulin pumps: (all basically the same and wonderful and contain bolus calculators and \"insulin on board\" features). Insulin pumps use Humalog or Novolog insulin.Medtronic 512 and 712 - works with a blood glucose meter that sends results directly to the pump by radio frequencyDeltec Cozmo - works with a blood glucose meter attached to itAnimas - has several great featuresWith an insulin pump you need to monitor blood glucose more frequently and be connected to the pump 24/7 but quality of life much improved over injections.\u00a0\u00a0Also, better blood sugar results and A1cs possible.With Lantus insulin, there are no peaks so less hypoglycemia and you don't have timed meals and snacks.\u00a0\u00a0You usually take one shot per day and use Humalog or Novolog for meals.For my son, Humalog and Novolog work basically the same.\u00a0\u00a0There are also insulin pens with Humalog and Novolog for convenience.I hope this helps.",
