            "answer": "What time was the cortisol test taken?There is the diurnal rhythm and if your doctor was intelligent, bells should be ringing in his head that the kids rhythm is off, so that he is too low during the day, and probably too high at night, and that is where the damage is being done.He should see someone that knows about Cushing's syndrome. The pains can come from the cortisol coming and going - it hurts!Testing is a pain... but I had Cushing's disease where I was cyclical and only high at night when I was high, and it was hard to catch even though I looked and felt awful. You need to find the right kind of doctor.",

            "answer": "Ahh, thanks so much for the comment.The blood test was during our appt, which I think was afternoon -- 3:30 or so.He didn't give me a number, just said it came back slightly low, and now they are checking for ACTH levels -- if that's high\u00a0\u00a0but cortisol is low, that would indicate adrenal gland not functioning correctly.\u00a0\u00a0That bloodwork was drawn yesterday around 1:45 PM.\u00a0\u00a0The MRI of the adrenal glands is on May 14.\u00a0\u00a0It's his left on that has some kind of calcification - and the doctor (I didn't like him) that mentioned it tossed it off as unimportant, something that could have happened during birth.That's very interesting that you can have Cushings but not be high all the time -- that's good to know, because I was hopeful that we're at least on the trail of the actual problem, and not running down another dead end, but when he said the cortisol was low, my spirits sank, since his symptoms line up better with Cushings than Addisons (at least from what I found googling, not a medical degree).I know everyone here will probably sympathize with what a long road we've been on, seems like forever!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I'm\u00a0\u00a0holding my breath until we get more test results.\u00a0\u00a0One thing I know -- and yes, I realize he's got some emotional stuff going on, too -- but I think there is something physical at the root of it, not just psycho-somatic like the pediatric GI doc was ready to toss it of to, so we're going to keep pressing on until, hopefully, we find something.When you say the cortisol comes and goes and it was painful, can I ask where/what way you had pain?\u00a0\u00a0He complains of bad headaches a lot, and pains in his hands, feet, and legs.\u00a0\u00a0And, of course, the stomach stuff.\u00a0\u00a0A year-plus ago he had stress fractures in both legs just below the knees, but those have been checked off as okay now.",

            "answer": "3:30 is a ...bad time to test, as well as 1:45. The best times to test are 8am, fasting, and midnight. Afternoons are very difficult as cortisol is lowering anyway.I had Cushing's and my cortisol was all over the place - Cushing's is inappropriate cortisol so it can be cortisol at night. Even now, post op without my adrenals, I still look a bit Cushie and it looks like I still may be producing a bit of my own cortisol - and again, at times when I should not. Some doctors want super high ranges and silly things, but the damage is done when the body does not \"rest\" and muscles and bones do not develop properly and even cateracts and sometimes bone necrosis happens. That is why he has stress fractures. Cortisol eats bone.BTW, GI, symptoms are typical.It hurts - everywhere. They use corticosteroids to treat inflammation, well, when the steroids recede and the inflammation comes back, it hurts, like heck! So to have that happen all the time, when you cannot control it, is crazy. Actually, when you have high cortisol, you feel good, and that is when you should test, and when you feel awful and achey, is when you are low. The headaches may be from a pituitary tumor. Up to 40% will not show up on a MRI scan. It has to be done properly - dynamic. Dye injected while pics are taken A 3T machine helps now too.",

            "answer": "Hi,Can anyone assist? I have been riddled with nausea for almost 2 years now. I have been in and out of the ER and Drs. offices for just as long! It was suggested that it was my gallbladder even though all the tests came back fine! I agreed to have it removed as I was desperately desperate! In the meantime, I got worse and worse. I recently changed ALL my Drs. and the Gastro. Dr. found low AM cortisol (I am waiting for the results of biopsies from endoscopy). I went to the ER last night 6pm as I was experiencing extreme fatique, immense body pain and dizziness. They found nothing except low MPV level. I am waiting to see the Endo Dr. who \"has seen nothing in faxes that the other Drs. have sent thus far that would lead them to believe this is a metabolism issue.\" And it is because of this, I am not even sure the Dr. will meet with me.I strongly feel this is a cortisol/adrenal gland issue and yet it seems no one will listen. It seems to take forever to get into an Endos. office and I am in a state of fear right now and that is definately hard for a strong independant woman like myself!
