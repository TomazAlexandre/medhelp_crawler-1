Nor have I ever read the two arteries (RCA and LCX) bypassed together presents a very high risk.You have a strong heart as evidenced by 70% EF. Six years ago, I had an EF19 to 29% and that caused heart failure and today my heart is pumping normally.\u00a0\u00a0I had/have totally blocked LAD (collateral vessels developed to provide a natural bypass.)\u00a0\u00a0The RCA was 98% blocked and stented.\u00a0\u00a0My LCX is/was 72% blocked...no stent.\u00a0\u00a0Medication, exercise and diet improved my health.The Cleveland Clinic accepts medical records (fax, etc.) and provides a diagnoses.\u00a0\u00a0Also, the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota is well recognized health center as well.\u00a0\u00a0Both have up-to- date technology and skill, acknowledge, and experienced heart surgeon.Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Take care.",
