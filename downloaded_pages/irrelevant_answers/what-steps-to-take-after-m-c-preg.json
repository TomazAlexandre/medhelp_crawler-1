            "answer": "Hello,Most doctors want you to wait for 3 cycles, but as you can see on this board, some of us have a hard time listening to that advice (me included). Given that your losses were so close together, I would wait the three cycles to let your body heal. During that \"down\" time, you can start researching new OB's. When I chose my current one, I actually asked the desk if they had a younger, female doctor who has either had kids and/or experienced a m/c. Sure enough, they actually set me up with a pg OB : )I personally prefer female OB's as they have generally understood my worries better than men. Ask around, do what Lisa suggested and call the L&D ward of a hospital, and with todays technology you can find tons of info online.I am very sorry for your losses and I know the no words can ease your pain right now. just know you are in the company of many women who have felt your pain and are willing to talk anytime. If you would like to chat off the forum, email me(I am a stay at home mom and have a night baby so I am up all night)Andreaemail: AndiJ.***@****",

            "answer": "I suggest going to a doctor who is willing to run a series of tests to determine whether there is a reason behind the miscarriages. After my 2nd miscarriage, my doctor ran tests that checked for problems related to hormones, autoimmune, lupus, diabetes, anything that might have caused the miscarriage. Many doctors insist on 3 miscarriages before running these tests but there are some who believe that 2 consecutive miscarriages warrant further testing. Also, be sure to continue taking blood tests until your hcg level decreases to less than 5. That will ensure that everything is out of your system. I hope this helps. Take care.",
