Avoiding the sweets and bad carbs will make you lose weight, and exercise even if you just walk everyday, just get moving. The insulin is not harming your body but helping it, so don't worry about this.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know how much you weigh to know how much you need to lose.\u00a0\u00a0You want to be as close to what's normal for someone your height. Don't overwhelm yourself with the diet, take it one day at a time.\u00a0\u00a0The best way for you to eat is to eat small things every 3-4 hours, this keeps your metabolism up (lose weight) and your blood sugar levels remain more stable.\u00a0\u00a0Keep a positive attitude regarding your stroke, this will take you far.\u00a0\u00a0One day at a time, you will get there.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you all the best and do take care!",

            "answer": "To add to mammo, changing lifestyle habits can go a long way in controlling type 2 diabetes. Restrict & avoid refined sugars, practice and adhere to weight control, do some sort of exercise daily, practice stress management, and get adequate sleep. These are all important in managing this illness, the most important, along with proper nutrition, is physical activity. The latter helps maintain proper blood pressure levels too.Besides watching sugar in your diet-- you also need to watch carbohydrates [starches] carefully too. For example; things like white breads, potatoes, pasta, crackers, foods made with white flour, etc. can cause a drastic rise in your blood sugar [They are converted to sugar after you eat them]. Lower your intake of man-made or prepared foods. You may jump to buy that fat free yogurt because, well, it\u2019s lower in fat but if you read the ingredient label that lower fat was substituted with higher amounts of sugar.Other foods/drinks need care too. For example; milk [sugar], fruit & fruit juices [fructose aka fruit sugar] also can cause blood sugar to rise [so serving sizes and moderation are important]. With fruit it\u2019s important to eat them with other foods to slow the absorption of fructose. I'm NOT saying that these foods aren't allowed. What I AM saying is that you need to use care and follow the guidelines for diabetics \u2013 avoid sugar, avoid bad carbs, avoid sugary liquids, eat proper foods like more vegies, fish and poultry.",

            "answer": "In your advice to Jaydee1977, you say and I quote \"fruit & fruit juices [fructose aka fruit sugar] also can cause blood sugar to rise\". This statement may give the impression that fructose can cause blood sugar (blood glucose)\u00a0\u00a0to rise. Is that correct ? The biology that I learned\u00a0\u00a0said that in humans, the metabolic pathway /breakdown of fructose does not go via glucose formation. Having said that, fructose in excess is still bad because most of it is converted into fat by the body !\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise, I think you offer very good advice.I would also add carbohydrate and calorie counting for better management of diabetes.",

            "answer": "\"This statement may give the impression that fructose can cause blood sugar (blood glucose)\u00a0\u00a0to rise. Is that correct ?\"Yes, it is true fructose does raise glucose levels. But individuals vary, some can tolerate fruit some cannot. What is known is that fruit consumed by themselves raise blood glucose levels faster than when eaten with other foods. That is why I stress the importance of consuming fruit with other foods. The bottom line is test your glucose prior to and after consuming fruit to see which ones your body can or cannot tolerate.Up to this year fruit [berries & melons] had little affect on my glucose levels. Not anymore. For me and others I have discussed this topic with we are the exception who cannot tolerate any fruit, even in the smallest amount [sigh].",
