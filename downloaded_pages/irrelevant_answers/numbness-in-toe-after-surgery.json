            "answer": "Hey, Io111, thanks for the suggestion. I will mention to my doctor next time I see her.\u00a0\u00a0I did have a painful ankle after the surgery (which was just cosmetic eye surgery, no stirrups or anything like that).\u00a0\u00a0I attributed this pain -- which was rather intense and would not go away with the heavy painkillers they were giving me -- to a bad positioning of the foot while I was \"out,\" although my Merkel medical books says that people may experience a gout attack --would you believe-- after surgery and mainly due to some pain killers that elevate uric acide levels in the blood.\u00a0\u00a0Go figure.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, thanks for writing back, very kind of you.\u00a0\u00a0Take care.",

    "question": "Hi, seems like I developed numbness and \"pins and needles\"feeling on my left toe right after surgery I had a couple of weeks ago (nothing relating the the spine)\u00a0\u00a0 I have no idea how this happened, all I know is that I had no such problem before the anaesthesia and operation, but woke up having it.\u00a0\u00a0I could not have developed gout or diabetes within the five hours of the operation, for sure, and it is definitely not a case of tight shoes.\u00a0\u00a0Help, please!!!",
