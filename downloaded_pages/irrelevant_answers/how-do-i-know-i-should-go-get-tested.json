            "answer": "\"havent gone to dr yet but i dont like going there much\"You're going to have to face up to the facts:1. Only seeing a doctor face-to-face will resolve your health issue(s).2. Posting on forums may get you \"assumed\" answers only, no resolve/cure to your health issue(s).3. Ignoring seeing a doctor by making excuses means you are ignoring your daughter too. If you get bed ridden ill who's going to care for her?Please take the time to go see a doctor before it gets worse.",

            "answer": "I guess you can't take the honest truth. And, yes, I am frank. If you want an answer then I will give you an honest answer and not join your pity party.But do you take my suggestions seriously? No-o-o, you get angry and lash out. Lash out because I said you need to see a doctor to get to the bottom of your health issues? If you already have an appointment then says so instead of saying, \"havent gone to dr yet but i dont like going there much\" which infers you haven't done squat.I brought your daughter up because you, and you alone, are ignoring medical attention and that will only lead to her being left behind. Waiting for a doctor? To say, \"YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT DRS they can not only be azzes and tell you theres no opening for months to come\" is probably true in your case. With your attitude I can understand why doctors don't want to see you but put you off in hopes you go somewhere else. Instead of whining and shouting at people why don't you go to an ER? You do have a local hospital nearby? You may have to wait while more urgent care patients are seen before you but you will see a doctor, get tested, and questions answered.Another thing, if you truly wanted to learn about diabetes Google \"diabetes\" and you will get 95,000,000 hits. That's ninety five million! With your three graduate degrees you should be able to 'read' and 'learn' something about this disease - prevention, care, and treatment instead of ranting, raving and pouting.Lastly, since you brought up bipolar MedHelp does have \"bipolar\" and \"mental health\" forums.Good luck and I hope you find what you're looking for.",

            "answer": "I first read the first thread On Dec 8th but stayed away due to all the rambling verbiage. Something told me this poster is a little unstable above the shoulders. Proof was when she missed your entire point. It didn't seem to me that you were picking on her child but pointing out the fact that by her ignoring her health is the same as her ignoring her child's well being. Talk about an emotional train wreck! And to claim 3 post graduate degrees? I find it difficult to believe this person wrote three thesis, especially with the vague and cryptic language presented in her arguments. I hope she rereads her threads and understands her unnecessary ranting did not prevent a response, that we are here to help even though she became angry over positive suggestions.",
