The ER dr looked at it and checked my blood pressure listened to my lungs and heart and said that i was not gonna be around by this fall and told me to do the best i could and then sent me home thats because I have no insurance I feel fine although my fingers and 1/2 the plam of my hand is still dead with no feeling, of course it is not swelled but feels that it is 5 times the size. I have tied to get dr appointments although no-one will see me unless I have $500. up front and thats like getting up $10,000 at this time I need some help with this does anyone know anything and by the way I don't think I am gonna die very soon and the ER I went too was a county hospital it was based on the money you make I make $175. each week and had to pay $20. there just to be seen and told\u00a0\u00a0nothing he could do for me.",
