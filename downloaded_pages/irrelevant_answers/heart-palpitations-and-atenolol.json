            "answer": "I don't know and haven't looked up Atenolol, is it a beta blocker?It is best no to change you dose of any medication without consulting your doctor, but I'm sure you know that.\u00a0\u00a0Many of us try varying the dose if the medication gives us some unpleasant side-effects, such as low BP with a beta blocker.Given you only reduced the dose, I doubt very much that you did any damage to your heart.\u00a0\u00a0But, I believe going \"cold turkey\" on beta blockers should not be done, that said I\"m not sure the doctor has never done that with me.\u00a0\u00a0I've taken Metoprolol off and on over the years (on right now) and I may have been told to just stop taking it in the past.\u00a0\u00a0I know I have varied my dose from as much as 200 mg a day to 100 mg a day in one step.\u00a0\u00a0This was with consultation with my doctor.",

    "question": "Tried to lower my Atenolol in October 2008 because blood pressure was getting low at night (take 25 mg around 5-6 pm every night).\u00a0\u00a0Lowered about 1/5 of a tablet.\u00a0\u00a0After a few days, around 4 pm in the afternoon, had significant strong beat in chest.\u00a0\u00a0Sent me back in my chair a little.\u00a0\u00a0No shortness of breath or other signs of MI.\u00a0\u00a0No pain after this.\u00a0\u00a0Well, went back on full dose atenolol at night.\u00a0\u00a0Since then, have some \"palpitations\" if that is what they are every now and then.\u00a0\u00a0Called cardiologist when this happened, and they had a note of me having some palpitations when they did some of their tests.\u00a0\u00a0They told me to keep working out and tell them if have any significant changes.\u00a0\u00a0Could I have damaged my heart when reducing atenolol?\u00a0\u00a0When slightly reduced, did not change activity, worked out as usual.\u00a0\u00a0These things kind of worry me.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for any input.\u00a0\u00a0I take atenolol for inappropriate sinus tachycardia.\u00a0\u00a0Since I take at night, HR usually runs 80-100 during day.\u00a0\u00a0Right now at 5:05 pm is 81.",
