    "question": "A fex months ago a started noticing weakness in my hands at night and when I woke up, then it would go away after a few minutes. Also a tingling sensation in my thumb and index finger. Two weeks ago I started feeling nerve pain all over my body, sometimes in my neck, other time times in my extremities. I have a terrible constant pain in my shoulders and sometimes in my upper back, arms, legs or fingers. Sometimes I also feel tingling in my toes and pain in my knees and elbows. A had some tests done and it's neither arthritis nor diabetes. What can it be? I'm terrified that it might be a tumor or something. Please help!",
