    "question": "Ok... Could someone please explain to me the gestational diabetes test?From my knowledge they dose you up with glucose and test your sugar in a hr right ??Then if you fail that you have to come back and do it again, but it's in 3hrs.Ok my OB never had me take the GD test. He has me just testing my blood sugar before I eat. Every time I test it's in normal ranges. But every time I eat I get really tired and my mouth gets dry and I can't drink enough water..... so I was wondering if maybe my blood sugar was going way too high after I eat. What do you all think?",
