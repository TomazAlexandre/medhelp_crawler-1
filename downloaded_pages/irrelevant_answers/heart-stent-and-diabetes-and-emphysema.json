The emphesema may make it difficult for him to exercise.The smoking will only worsen his emphysema.You should try to see if he would be agreeable to a cardiac rehabilitation program and visit with a cardiologist to discuss some type of program to decrease his risk. He is on a course for more complications from his disease.good luck",

Family history of heart failure and heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0I am trying to figure out how the diabetes and emphysema is affecting his heart.\u00a0\u00a0He will not quit smoking (pack to pack and half a day), won't watch his diet, and basically denying that there is any problems.\u00a0\u00a0When they did the stent they noted Apical hypokinesis.\u00a0\u00a0I have not been able to find much about what that means.\u00a0\u00a0As you may figure out, I am at a loss as to what I can do.I know if he won't do anything he may not live to be 60 but I am trying to understand is what I may expect.\u00a0\u00a0I am worried about a massive heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0Any information would be helpful.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
