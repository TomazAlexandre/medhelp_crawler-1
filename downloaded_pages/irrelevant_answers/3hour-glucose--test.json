            "answer": "Most people that fail the first 1 its by such a slim amount that they do the 3 hour as a precaution but it usually gets passed. Gestational diabetes is a pain in the butt! Lol some women find it easier than others but don't take it lightly and don't stress too much! Hopefully you pass this one though and don't have to deal with any of it. And yeah the 3 hour is disgusting because they give you so much more to drink. Hopefully they let you breathe and drink it at your own pace...I had to literally chug all of mine or the lady said I'd have to come back and have it tested again! Yuck!",
