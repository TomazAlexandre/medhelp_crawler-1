            "answer": "I am not a doctor, but the mom of a type one diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Each person is different on how quickly they come up from a low and it depends on how low you go.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter usually comes up quickly form a low with in 5-10minutes.\u00a0\u00a0She can also take up to an hour depending on how much insulin is still active in her system.\u00a0\u00a0 Also everyone has different symptoms at different lows.\u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes my daughter is having a bad low at 70 other times she could be having bad low at 50.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is very possible that your roommate was low and came up quickly.\u00a0\u00a0Most diabetics do not fake highs or lows are not a fun thing.I would suggest your talk to your roommate and ask her what her usual symptoms are when she is high or low so that you might be able to help her before she gets into a crisis situation. If a person goes to low they can have a seizure of pass out the same can happen then they go to high.\u00a0\u00a0I do this with my daughter",

            "answer": "I agree with the answer above... yes, a person could be so low that they couldn't help themselves, and then after being given some sweet juice or tea, could have glucose levels at 135 within a very short time. What you and your other non-diabetic roommate don't know is whether her own body was already trying to help by releasing liver sugars stored for emergencies like this. I also agree that I have never heard of a diabetic doing this for attention. We get very embarrassed after an episode like this whereby we cannot help ourselves, and frightened, too, and would never do this deliberately. Or fake something that puts us at the mercy of other people and makes us feel so bad.Don't feel used. What you did may have saved her life. While a severe hypoglycemic episode is normally no big deal if the person is found and given some quick sugar, it can be life-threatening if the person is not helped. Even if you have doubts about the honesty of the person's reaction, you cannot afford to not come to the rescue.I personally am shocked at how cynical your other roommate's reaction is. If the diabetic roommate had NOT been hypoglycemic and had been faking, and you gave her sweet tea, her glucose levels would have spiked up way over the very normal 135 when you tested her, believe me.",

            "answer": "Just test her before you give her anything to eat or drink to be sure. This way you know to call an ambulance or not.Yes. Blood sugars CAN rise that fast. Just give me a few sips of soda and my bg's (blood glucose) will skyrocket within 3 to 5 minutes.I'm sorry that you distrust your roomate. This disease is bad enough.. but to have folks start doubting makes it even worse.",
