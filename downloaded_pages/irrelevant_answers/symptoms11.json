    "question": "I'm 19 weeks and did my 3 hour glucose\u00a0\u00a0yesterday so I still don't know if I have gestational diabetes. I know my blood pressure is slightly elevated. So maybe twice a week I will get weak and shakey and my arms feel heavy like after you hold a baby too long.....idk if this has to do with my blood pressure or blood sugar. I didn't have OJ so I drank a little soda it didn't help. Laid down to relax a little, didn't help. Had to go pick up my 10 year olds, started to have hot flashes. No cramping or bleeding or anything like that. Just a lil nauses but I don't think I'm gonna lose it. It happens when i shop too long too. Any ideas what's wrong and what can help? Tia",
