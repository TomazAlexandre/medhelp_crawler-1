    "question": "I'm 23 years old male and I got Trichomonas Vaginalis and some kind of a bacteria that couses NGU about 5 years ago and since then I've been trying to fight these STDs without geting any better.I also have enlarged prostate,most urologists tell me that there is nothing they can do to help my prostate, they can shrink it but they can't heal it.I've been taking many kinds of antibiotics, mostly Flagyl, Azitromicin and Doxycicline many many times for the past 5 years.I've also been taking flagyl the liquid form that gets into your veins for 12 days 3 times a day. I always feel a litle beter after each course but couple days after the end of each course everything gets back to normal. DO YOU KNOW HOW TO END THIS NIGHTMARE. I am only 23 years old male and I have constant pain in the testicles and prostate and use the restroom many times a day without fully emtying the bladder.I also feel not sexually active, it's hard to get it up I am prety sure the bacteria did some damage to my manhood. Do you know any way of killing this stubborn parasite called Trichomonas and the bacteria that causes my NGU????I hope that a man like you with number of years in this field might know something, a cure to end my nightmare??? Thank you.",
