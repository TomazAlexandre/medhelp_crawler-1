My comment is more to bump your post along since it's possible one of the more experienced members might have some insight, ideas or suggestions. The only thing I can say with certainty is that given some of the conditions you mentioned drinking alcohol to help with pain is probably not a wise idea. I don't think you posted too much information since it's possible some of these things could be related.",

            "answer": "Well alcohol isn't a pain reliever and you should really talk to your Dr about that as well. But yes get hep c test and if they haven't already sent you to a g.I specialist for your stomach issues and pain you need to get a referral to one even if it isn't hep c there are a handful of other gastric things that your symptoms fall under! If the drs are not doing lots of test or helping trying to find your problem then fire then you don't have to keep a Dr you know. But yes get Geo c test and also please see someone about your drinking to ease pain that is also a problem sweetie I'm sure you know it may help with pain but only for a bit then it causes worse pain please look into stopping drinking for sure. Hope you find a good path to Wellness!",

            "answer": "Hello, and I read your posts with great interest...I will offer a piece of advise and that is get your dr to check for hemochromatosis...it is the most common and rarely diagnosed genetic disease and is the root cause of many of the problems you complain of. I know, my husband was just diagnosed and it is astounding that for something so common the drs are missing this. He had issues for 10 years before discovering the hep c and then the hemochromatosis just in the last 3 weeks. Look it up, I can only tell you that you will be amazed. The symptoms you describe are all classic for the HHC. Get back to me if you need some more info. I have become an expert in the last three weeks. Have to, the drs. seem to have no idea.Best wishes. This is a simple blood test",

    "question": "A couple days ago I joined and posted in here concerning Hep C antibodies for my Hubbys life insurance test.\u00a0\u00a0I have big issues with pain and posted in the pain community forum.\u00a0\u00a0These issues I've had for some time.\u00a0\u00a0Now I'm questioning if I need tested also for Hep C after doing some reading.\u00a0\u00a0I know last year I was told I had a fatty liver and my GGT levels were elevated to 58 (U/L 5-36) and my HGB was considered high at 4.9 (G/DL 11.7-14.5) along with a few other things that was high or low.\u00a0\u00a0I chalked it up to age, hormones and/or weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0I'll copy and paste what I wrote.My paste from the Pain Management Community:My lower back is killing me, mid back is sore.\u00a0\u00a0Every time I eat my stomach feels so sore and tight and bloated it's unreal.\u00a0\u00a0Drinking even just a glass of water can bring it on.\u00a0\u00a0I look 6 months pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I've been dealing with my BP shooting up again (165/95 range) maybe due to constant pain.I also get massive headaches that come and go in waves were they may only last 5-30 seconds.\u00a0\u00a0I have also had issues with shooting pains threw out my entire body like a traveling lightning bolt.\u00a0\u00a0Sigh.\u00a0\u00a0I've told my doctors about the spams threw out my body now for the last 7-8 years.\u00a0\u00a0They have no answers.\u00a0\u00a0Weather changes seem to bring those spasms on but they can flare up at any time.I feel like my body is made out of glass and is about ready to shatter apart due to pressure.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to scream some days.I live in a small town that don't believe in giving out pain pills anymore.\u00a0\u00a0The only way I can cope is by having a few stiff drinks at night for relief and to be able to sleep some......in which is not helping me health wise.I've been trying sweet mint crushed in my ice water and looking into different herbs to grow that might help.\u00a0\u00a0Thinking about trying vervein, kava kava or Ginger.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing is helping anymore.Short history....I do have type ll diabetes (only is high when forced to drink sugar drink so I call it pre diabetes), have had been told also that I have IBS in which has been acting up lately.\u00a0\u00a0I know tmi.\u00a0\u00a0I have hypothyroidism, and meds for it.\u00a0\u00a0I also take BP meds, low dose asperin and diaretics for edema, vitamin D and E also.\u00a0\u00a0All directed by my doctor.Anyone have a clue on what can be causing this pain?Also would love any suggestions for pain relief!Any suggestions on a specific type of doctor/s?Please Help I'm at my whits end in pain, and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.Thank you in advance.",
