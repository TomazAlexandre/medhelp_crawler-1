            "answer": "Only your girlfriend's Doctor can determine whether she needs shots or some type of medication which comes in pill form.\u00a0\u00a0It is my understanding that with the Type 2 Diabetes, a person would be started on pill medication.If her blood levels are not controlled (go too high) her doctor MAY increase the pills.\u00a0\u00a0(That is what happened to me initially)\u00a0\u00a0There are patients in my Diabetes class who have gone from pills to Pills + Insulin, or Pills plus another medication.\u00a0\u00a0Mine is the second, I must inject Byetta twice a day, however this is not insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Just another medication which helps to control blood sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0(also control hunger)In any case, be sure to have your girlfriend contact her Doctor, ask for an A1C test and please, please have her take a list of questions.\u00a0\u00a0You do not indicate who told her she has Type 2 Diabetes so that needs to be verified.Also, if she does not know which questions to ask, there are many websites which describe Diabetes (WebMD for example) also she can just Google \"Type 2 Diabetes\" to see other information on line.Good Luck, let us know what happens\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Anita",

            "answer": "Yes, I did/do have a problem getting sleepy alot, before finding out about the Diabetes & even now.\u00a0\u00a0Mine however, is because I suffer from Sleep Apnea and apparently does not have anything to do with the Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Before I knew about this ailment I was somewhat addicted to No Doz to stay awake during the day.\u00a0\u00a0If she has this problem that is another thing she can question her doctor about.\u00a0\u00a0There is a test which will tell if she needs to use a breathing machine while sleeping.The HbA1C test will simply show her an average of what the blood levels have been within the 3 months prior to testing.\u00a0\u00a0It is a good thing to have done and her Doctor should be able to explain it to her.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetics should have this done a few times a year to see how they are doing.Anita",

            "answer": "Andrew - Did not know that you were suffering also, so very sorry to hear this.\u00a0\u00a0Hate to hear that your health took a nose dive.\u00a0\u00a0What type of pain are you talking about??\u00a0\u00a0Also, what state are you in where there is no insurance?\u00a0\u00a0Here in California I believe that even if one does not work that there are places you can go for medical help.\u00a0\u00a0I think that if you just show up ill at an Emergency Room they have to see you.\u00a0\u00a0Who knows though, perhaps each state is different.My health is about the same.\u00a0\u00a0I suppose that if I would just follow the instructions of my many Physicians and quit smoking that things would be a little better.\u00a0\u00a0(financially too)\u00a0\u00a0I just continue to take my many medications and hope (and pray) for the best.\u00a0\u00a0My many ailments are too numerous to name but it seems that each day I hear of someone worse off than me so I try not to complain too loud.In any case, please continue to let me know how you & your girlfriend are doing.\u00a0\u00a0Will be praying for both of you.\u00a0\u00a0[Oh yes, just to let you know - my screen name doesn't mean I'm a Nun, just that I am Anita and have 3 Sisters!!!\u00a0\u00a0:-)\u00a0\u00a0Too many people think I am a Nun]Anita",
