    "question": "Lately I have had a new, strange symptom. I eat regularly and I'm generally in good shape, but lately I have the sensation that I haven't eaten even if I just did. I will get light headed 'food related' type feeling head aches and the shakes. Even after eating again it does not stop. I am tracking my calories and water intake to make sure I am eating enough and the right foods and I am, does anybody else have this weird symptom?",
