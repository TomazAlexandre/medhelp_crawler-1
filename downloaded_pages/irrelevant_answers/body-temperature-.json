            "answer": "It's most likely normal and due to an increase in your metabolism with pregnancy. I get hot too. But I thought I'd mention that you can also \"heat up\" if your blood sugars are too high and you are an undiagnosed type 2 diabetic or have gestational diabetes. So if you have other symptoms during the day and haven't done your gestational diabetes drink test yet that is also a possibility. That happened to me with my first pregnancy.",
