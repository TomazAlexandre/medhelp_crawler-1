            "answer": "She is iron deficient from her heavy iron loss in her periods. This produces her anemia and secondary symptoms. She needs to be on iron replacement therapy and this should be guided by her doctor thru prescription strength supplementation. Once on iron her CBC should be monitored so that improvments are documented and that she feels better too, (this can take only a few days)...the blood work will improve in 3 weeks",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!It could be iron loss anemia and if pills are not suiting then you can try syrups or injections. Causes of heavy periods like endometriosis, any infection, fibroids and hormonal imbalance will have to be looked in. Extreme fatigue could also be due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems. Another possibility is sleep disturbances (like sleep apnea, imbalance of rapid eye and non rapid eye movement sleep etc.). You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, low Vit b12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium. Hyperthyroidism too causes increased sweating and tiredness.\u00a0\u00a0 A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Do discuss this with your daughter\u2019s doctor and get her examined. Hope these tips help. Take care!",
