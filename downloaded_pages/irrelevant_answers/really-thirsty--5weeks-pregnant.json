I keep a water bottle by my bed all the time. Our bodies are working extra hard, we need the fluids.\u00a0\u00a0Oh one more thing, I started to make sure I put on some chapstick before going to sleep, that helps with the lips going dry.",

    "question": "I'm 5 and a half weeks pregnant, and from even before I knew I was pregnant, I've been really thirsty. I keep drinking lots of water, so I don't think I'm dehydrated, but it's so bad that I can't sleep for more than a couple hours at a time before I wake up really dry. Is it just because I live in a cold, dry climate, or is it a normal symptom of pregnancy? Is anyone else this thirsty this early on (I've read about thirsty being a sign of gestational diabetes, but I think that only starts later)?",
