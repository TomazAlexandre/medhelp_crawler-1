            "answer": "\"Now is the seizures due to low sugar or high sugar.\"Diabetic seizures can be caused by either Hyperglycemia [high sugars] or Hypoglycemia [low sugars]. Hypoglycemic seizures are actually more common than hyperglycemic seizures. Having either is life threatening and the potential of a coma can happen.Is your BF planning to see his Endocrinologist to ensure both are on the same page - treatment plan, correct oral medication/s including insulin dosages, lifestyle changes needed, education on preventing diabetic seizures? I highly suggest that he sees an Endo before his diabetes worsens.Are you of your BF educated on:* The symptoms and early warning signs to prevent a diabetic seizure?* Does your BF have a home glucose test meter? Know the proper testing times? Know the normal test values?* When feeling the onset of a seizure has he/you tested his blood sugar levels?* Does he understand and follow a strict diabetes control and management - diet, weight, exercise?These are items an Endo can go over with him and you to help get his diabetes under better control.Good luck -",

It explains how to properly control blood sugar and to avoid highs and lows.If his blood sugars are so high and he is on oral meds, he may need insulin.\u00a0\u00a0If he is on insulin and his sugars are still so high, his whole dietary approach will need to be adjusted.",

            "answer": "Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0Some confusion already.\u00a0\u00a0I thought the seizures are only on low sugar.\u00a0\u00a0His eyes gets all blurry, he acts confused, agitated, irritable etc.\u00a0\u00a0Thought this are all signs for low blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0He naturally has very high sugar. So if he starts feeling like this and I give him milk with sugar, or glucose sweets or a glucose drink then it could worsen things if it is actually a higher blood sugar causing it?\u00a0\u00a0It usually happened because he drank allot, this thank God has now stopped.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The last seizure I think was because he skipped a meal. He has a seizure every 2 months or so.\u00a0\u00a0Was on Glucophase (think its spelled right) and we need to get another months supply.\u00a0\u00a0How often should we test his sugar?\u00a0\u00a0He does have the meter thingie.\u00a0\u00a0Also, what foods and drinks etc should he avoid totally?\u00a0\u00a0And what foods/drinks do you recommend I get that will help?\u00a0\u00a0We do not have medical insurance and unfortunately battling on the finance side so I need to try measures that will not cost us a fortune.\u00a0\u00a0I truly love my BF and want to help him through this.\u00a0\u00a0He has not accepted his illness.",
