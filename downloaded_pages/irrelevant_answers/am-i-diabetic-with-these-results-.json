            "answer": "Congratulations on taking things in hand and losing the weight! It sounds like that has lowered your blood sugar back into normal range. Your A1C you had done before puts you in the pre-diabetic range which begins at 5.7. However, it sounds like you have lowered your blood sugar with your weight loss and it would probably be better now. You are doing well and I would continue keeping your weight in the normal range and you might want to lower your carb intake a bit. Two sandwiches are a lot of carbs and orange juice is very carb intensive. You have a tendency towards diabetes and everything you can do to keep it from progressing is good. Keep up the good work!",

            "answer": "It is impossible to say if you will progress to diabetes or not and how long it will take if you do; there are just too many variables. But the bottom line is the more lifestyle changes you make, the longer you will keep your blood sugar lower: healthy weight, lower carb intake and regular exercise. Even if you have a good A1C it's not a good idea to think you are \" cured\"\u00a0\u00a0and revert to bad habits. The best idea is just to make the lifestyle changes a habit in your life.",
