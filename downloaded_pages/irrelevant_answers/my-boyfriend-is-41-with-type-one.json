            "answer": "It sounds like you have taken a lot on. First of all, your boyfriend has two chronic conditions, diabetes and manic depression.\u00a0\u00a0Having a chronic illness means that the illness is there forever, but can be managed with medication and monitoring.\u00a0\u00a0In many ways, both illnesses are similar in that if they are not managed well they can be devastating, but with the proper attention, people with these illnesses can live full and productive lives.\u00a0\u00a0The other similarity is that when these conditions are out of control, the results can impact everyone around the person even though the person themselves is the only one who can really take responsibility for the management of these chronic conditions.That's where you come in. It is important for you to understand diabetes and you are already doing that by getting on this site and asking the questions you are asking.\u00a0\u00a0Many diabetics do have swings in their blood sugars, but the range you are talking about, 50 -400's, is not the optimal range.\u00a0\u00a0As you have already noticed, his emotions may be affected by very high or very low blood sugars. Your boyfriend may need to consult with his physician or diabetes educator to make sure he is doing all the things he needs to be doing in order to narrow the range a bit. Although, it is difficult for any Type I diabetic to have perfect blood sugars all the time, he should be able to get it in a better range with close monitoring and adequat3e insulin, diet and exercise. A range of 80 to 150 might be a target range even though that is not always achievable. Those numbers will at least give you asense of how far out of the range your boyfriend is.\u00a0\u00a0Ultimately, all of those issues are his responsibility and the most you can do is be supportive and encourage him to see his doctor and follow the recommnded routine.Although smoking pot may not directly impact his blood sugar, it may cause him to eat more of the wrong types of foods or to become more lax about his diabetes care.\u00a0\u00a0But again, he will have to make those decisions about his care and his health. Good luck.Es",

            "answer": "Thanks so much for getting back to me.\u00a0\u00a0I guess what struck me the most in what you wrote is that this all is ultimately his responsibility.\u00a0\u00a0I am the kind of person that has a need to \"fix\" people. . .and I guess I need to be reminded that even though I do have a role to play. . .this is his battle to fight.\u00a0\u00a0You can lead a horse to water as they say.He does not take any medication for his manic disorder. . .He says that he hates to, because of the way it makes him feel like sleeping all of the time.\u00a0\u00a0As it is he has very little energy and even less motivation.\u00a0\u00a0I can not imagine him having less of either.\u00a0\u00a0I do love him very much. . .but do not want to be his mother.He has abused drugs in the past and gone days without eating and weeks without testing his sugar.\u00a0\u00a0He seems to have turned over a new leaf since we have been involved. . .but I am just honestly really worried.My mom has type two. . .so I know that this disease is managable.\u00a0\u00a0I want him to be healthy that is all. . .Healthy and Happy. . .and both seem to swing quite a bit.Kelly",
