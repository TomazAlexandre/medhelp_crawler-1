            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The symptoms could also be due to Vit C, Vit B and iron deficiency. Hence take a multivitamin pill having all of the above. Try this for 2 weeks. If it does not help then the symptoms could also be due to contact dermatitis due to coming in touch with spoon, glass, food, tooth brush, plastics, toothpaste etc. Tingling and burning of lips could be the side effect of any drugs you could be taking. The symptoms could also be due to anxiety. Low calcium and hypoparathyroidism could be the other causes. Undiagnosed diabetes could be another possibility. Alternatively hypoglycemia too can cause tingling and burning. Dehydration and electrolyte (sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium) imbalance too could be a cause. Hence take an ORS solution too with the multivitamin. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "A month or so ago my lips started burning and I though it was from the spicy burrito meat I ate.\u00a0\u00a0It went away a few days later.\u00a0\u00a0A few weeks later I experienced the burning again for a few days.\u00a0\u00a0Then I thought it was perhaps a cut on my lip and salt had gotten into the cut.\u00a0\u00a0Then last week my lips started burning again and a day or two later the insides of my lips were all red and maybe even a little swollen.\u00a0\u00a0I did eventually get slight cracks in the corners of my mouth.\u00a0\u00a0I kept using lip moisturizer but they still burned.\u00a0\u00a0I used petroleum jelly for 2 days and it may have helped a bit.\u00a0\u00a0I then tried the medicated Carmax which seemed to work, applying every 30 min., but after 24 hrs I think it dried them out even more.\u00a0\u00a0Then I read about applying honey, which seemed to lessen the burn, but after a day they started to burn like before.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps I applied the products too often?\u00a0\u00a0I found Neosporin Lip Health, Overnight Renewal Therapy (with white petroleum) and it has seemd to help as lips not as red or burning.\u00a0\u00a0I'm wondering if this is an allergery or just sunburned or severly chapped?\u00a0\u00a0 I did notice a bit of white on lips but and perhaps small bubbling but (no peeling) don't know if it was from the products.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Should I see a doctor if this doesn't go away completely or if it comes back?\u00a0\u00a0What could this be?",
