Do me a favor and ask your brother which organ he wants to give up?\u00a0\u00a0Ask him if he wants to be blind, an amputee or a vegetable with a stroke... Its not an easy feat to take care of diabetes beleive me I know but I also know that with every breath I take I want to live...He is is desperate need of psychiatric counseling... When I was in my 20s one night I decided to drink too much and not watch my eating... Iwound up in the hospital with a DKA coma and am lucky I lived.. we don't get too many chances... I hope that your brother does well but that he allowed himself to get in that condition shows he has a problem.. My problem was a ex husband that had just left me with a 2 week old baby, a 6 year old and a 9 year old and cleaned out all the money,,,, AIl I wanted was to drink away my problems.. never did it again... Thats not to say now I don't enjoy a glass of wine... but I also know other ways to handle things now... and I handle a lot with having both...I send good wishes.. and please take this with the intent I send it.. I hope for good things for your brother... Ronni",
