            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Evening rise in temperature is generally due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroid states, dehydration, overwork, stress and fatigue. It is also seen in diseases like tuberculosis. Drink water and other fluids during the day and see if it helps.In women, even polycystic ovary, menopause, PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) should be investigated for.Do discuss with your doctor and get this examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I've been going through similar problem. My usual body temperature is between 98.4 - 98.6. For the past two weeks, my body temperature has been fluctuating between 96.8 and 99.6. The body temperature is low in the morning and starts rising around afternoon(99 plus) and finally goes down either by the following morning or after I take a Crocin/PCM. I experience a headache and bodyache once it starts rising and feel drowsy and tired throughout and feel nauseatic every now and then. My apetite has gone down bigtime!I've been to 3 different doctors. The fist one gave me a 3 day course of anti-biotics and said that the body temperature should not fluctuate like that. The second one recommended some tests-blood and urine and mentioned that a possible cause of the same could be UTI since the samples of blood in the urine test were slightly higher than normal. The third guy completely ruled out the fact that \"I was running low grade fever\" and mentioned that it is normal for\u00a0\u00a0body temperature to fluctuate during the day and be on the higher side in the evenings. I do know my own body and the usual body temperature, which DOES NOT cross 98.6 for sure and I've never complained of any kind of aches! He's recommended GREATCEF 200mg and LIVOTIZ PLUS\u00a0\u00a0for 5 days. What could be the possible cause of the same?This discussion is related to/posts/show/692848.",
