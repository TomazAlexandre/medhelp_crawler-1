    "question": "I have recently found that I my hair line is receding. I have a skin rash all thoughout my scalp and when I rub my scalp I cover the desk with Dandruff. I also have a butterfly rash across my face which comes and goes on a daily basis. This rash extends to my eyebrows and is characterised by flaky skin. I have been using oroxine for two years but when I take it seems to flair up my face and when I ease off it my scalp flairs up. The rash doesn not itch. I am in a quandry. Dont get me wrong though I am still a very handsome fella. I hope this makes sence as I am speaking Australian.Does Oroxine have long term side effects on hair growth.",
