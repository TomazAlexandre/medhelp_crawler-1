            "answer": "Hi!Yes, according to American Diabetes Association, you can take zero calorie drinks if you have diabetes. These have artificial sweeteners and no carbohydrates. So, usually they do not raise the blood sugar on their own. However, there may be a surge in blood sugar if you have eaten something either along with them or before consuming the drink. However, not all drinks in a day should be zero calorie drinks or diet cokes. You should also drink plain water or water with some lemon squeezed into it.\u00a0\u00a0What is important is that your HbA1c should be under control. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
