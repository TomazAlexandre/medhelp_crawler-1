            "answer": "LadyQ, I certainly am no expert in the field either, but I am a Type 2 diabetic who was diagnosed about 4 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0Im not to sure how the tingly feeling would fit in with diabetes, unless youre thinking diabetic neropathy.\u00a0\u00a0Its my understanding that neuropathy normally strikes in the feet/toes first.\u00a0\u00a0(Furthest from the heart, less circulation)The urination thing is something I went through until I got my blood sugar under control.\u00a0\u00a0I never wet the bed, but was up 2-3 times a night to go to the bathroom.I'd suggest going to your general/family practitioner and bring the symptoms up.\u00a0\u00a0Have your husband go in on a fast for about 12 hours and have his blood sugar checked right there.\u00a0\u00a0(They poke a finger, take a drop of blood and put it on a tester)\u00a0\u00a0The results are within seconds, but your doctor would probably suggest a full blood lab.Hope that helps.",

            "answer": "Normal fasting blood sugar should be 100 or below. His Dr can easily check it in his office. Make sure your husband has had nothing but water 12 hours before the test. The arm tingling sounds like it's possibly heart related. I'm not trying to scare you because it could very well be something else. Does he get indigestion or any other symptoms? I know it might be impossible to get your husband to agree to a prostate exam but he really should have one done because it might have something to do with the wetting problem.\u00a0\u00a0Remar",

    "question": "My husband will be 38 years old this week.\u00a0\u00a0He doesn't have any major health problems, doesn't smoke, doesn't drink, etc.\u00a0\u00a0He is a normal weight (190 at 6'1\").\u00a0\u00a0But his eating habits are awful and he doesn't exercise regularly, although he is active (NOT a couch potato type).\u00a0\u00a0He has a family Hx of diabetes and heart problems. His LDL and sugar levels were borderline last time he went for a checkup (2 yrs ago).\u00a0\u00a0Dr told him to eat a lowfat diet and return in 2 months, neither of which happened.Here are his two symptoms that happened in 24 hours that have me concerned and I wonder if they are something to go to the doctor about and if they are possibly related.\u00a0\u00a0He is not concerned at all, but you know how men are.First on the way home from church yesterday morning he said that his left arm went tingly/numb like it had fallen asleep, but he was just sitting there (not propped on anything).\u00a0\u00a0It only last a moment, but then a little while later it got tingly again for a few seconds and then was okay again.\u00a0\u00a0He has had some problems with pain in his left shoulder over the past few months that we think is associated to a neck injury he had about 15 years ago (he was thrown off a horse).\u00a0\u00a0He received chiropractic therapy for his neck.\u00a0\u00a0But the past several years his left shoulder/arm gives him trouble - and he thinks it's related to his neck problem.\u00a0\u00a0Yesterday when he had the tinglies he told me maybe it was time to see a doctor.The tinglies were yesterday before lunch.\u00a0\u00a0Then this morning at 5 a.m. I heard him get up to go to the bathroom, but heard him making a racket in there and asked him what he was doing.\u00a0\u00a0Then it turned out he had wet the bed :(\u00a0\u00a0We've been married 10 years and to my knowledge that has never happened.\u00a0\u00a0He does get up just about every night to use the restroom in the middle of the night, and he told me a time or two he had a few 'close calls' where he had a few trickles before he made it to the toilet.\u00a0\u00a0But this is the first time he lost it all in the bed.\u00a0\u00a0He said he was dreaming he was going to the restroom and when he woke up he had already done it in the bed.Is this just random that both these things happened in a 24 hour period?\u00a0\u00a0I know that for a man to wet the bed is not uncommon and may not be a sign of anything major. He told me he will NOT discuss this with his doctor (his doc goes to church with us, so maybe that's why, but he said he still would not talk to a dr about it).My concern is that the tinglies in his left arm and the incontinence could be a sign of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He has been consuming a lot of liquids lately because we live in the south where the heat indexes are in the 100s and he works in a manufacturing plant where it gets kinda hot in there. I wouldn't be so worried about the diabetes with these 2 symptoms alone, but he drinks at least 3 canned sodas a day, craves sweets like you wouldn't believe, and rarely eats veggies (he's a meat/bread/potatoes man - will eat some veggies when I cook them but very little).Also - if this helps at all....he was craving 'breakfast for supper' last night.\u00a0\u00a0So we made bacon, eggs and pancakes.\u00a0\u00a0He eat 2 pancakes, 1 \u00bd scrambled eggs (cooked in the bacon grease), and probably 6-8 slices of low-sodium bacon.\u00a0\u00a0I know! The man likes bacon!\u00a0\u00a0I told him it was bad but he doesn't care.\u00a0\u00a0He drank 2 canned sodas with it also.\u00a0\u00a0And this was at about 8:00 p.m. when he ate it.\u00a0\u00a0We went to bed about 11 p.m.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe that had something to do with his fluid retention/loss of bladder control?Anyway - just wanted to post my concerns to see what feedback I would get.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
