            "answer": "It may also be digestive as you suspected. I've heard that acid refulx and stomach issues can cause bad breath. A friend of mine used to compalin about his breath and the taste in his mouth and found out he had stomach/digestive/acid issues which he had ot have adressed surgically. I've heard a way to tell the difference between a dental issue and a digestive issue is to have your husband breathe strictly out of his nose with mouth closed and if you can still smell odor, then it's more likely coming from his stomach. If it's only his mouth, he could have decay or like pertykitty mentioned, post nasal drip. Dry mouth can also do it as can a severe change in diet, I've heard.",

            "answer": "It's called halitosis.\u00a0\u00a0I pasted this for you.Currently, chronic halitosis is not very well understood or even recognized as a treatable condition by most physicians and dentists, so effective treatment is difficult to find. There are a growing number of bad breath clinics responding to this endemic problem; unfortunately, most are simply outlets for one breath product or another. As with all general-purpose formulations, any one particular product may be effective for some, partly effective for a few, and not at all helpful for others. A very small number of clinics use a detailed assessment process including microbiology to determine the specific type or types of odour-causing bacteria. The specific bacteria are then controlled by individualised treatments. This procedure results in a very high success rate. Some who take a more holistic view of the body, including naturopaths and alternative nutritionists, believe that halitosis can be cured or greatly diminished by improving the overall health of the digestive tract, especially the small and large intestines. This process usually requires a change in eating style, lifestyle, and diet.",

            "answer": "I had chronic bad breath problems, even though I brushed 3 times a day used mouthwash, sucked on breath mints...it was terrible.I was watching the Today show about a week ago and saw them talking about a product called \"Smart Mouth\". It is a mouthwash that has 2 separate bottles and you mix them toether before you use it. If you use it twice a day in a week or 2 you aren't suppose to have the bad breath problem anymore, even in the morning time!I used it and it worked! No more funky breath!!! Please try this and let us know if it works for you. I bought it at Walgreen's (although not all Walgreen's has it I noticed) and it is about $11.Don't forget to make sure he flosses!!!!Good luck",
