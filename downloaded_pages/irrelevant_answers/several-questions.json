            "answer": "First a Shout Out to you as a home girl. I was borned and raised in Austin and would move back if I did not have so many relatives living there.I have some bad news for you. Although different diabetics will demonstrate varied rates of development of complications, complications will occur. I was diagnosed with diabetes Type 2 (DM2) at age 55 and had a A1C of 9.3. My blood glucose (BG) was very high an uncontrolled for approximately 18 months. In that time I developed coronary artery disease which subsequently required triple by pass heart surgery. I also developed numbness in my feet and the brginning of kidney failure.You must get control of your diabetes ASAP. It really is a matter of life, death and deteriorating health.troytroy",

            "answer": "I'm sorry to hear of all your medical problems, troytroy, but I want to present a slightly more optimistic picture. Diabetic complications are not inevitable. I have spoken to people who have been diabetic for 20, 30 and even more years, with no complications. But troytroy is right that you do want to get your blood sugar under control.If you know that the interferon was making control difficult, than it's a good thing you are done with it and now you can get down to work. Being inconsistent, as you say, is not good. I know it's hard to fit diabetes management into your busy life but it has to be priority one. The good news is that once it gets to be a stable routine it will be easier.Many diabetics haven't gotten that much help from either dieticians (who are hopelessly behind the times with their info) or endos. They either read books and experiment (and test, test, test, because that's how you know what foods work for YOU)LADA can be a bit trickier because our pancreas' put out sporadic spurts. Have you had a c-peptide done to find out how much insulin you are producing? But you can get stability by figuring out your Insulin: Carb ratios, learning about the carbs in the foods you like to eat and seeing what works. Unfortunately it DOES take a lot of effort especially in the beginning and it sounds like you've had a lot on your plate. Hang in there. I'm LADA as well. In February I was totally insane trying to figure it all out (I was misdiagnosed Type II). Now it is fairly routine and steady.",

            "answer": "Hi Zoe,As usual you are full of good info.\u00a0\u00a0I think main problem is I snack constantly.\u00a0\u00a0I'm confused because endo said don't do humalog more frequently than every 3 hours but snacks spike BG.\u00a0\u00a0I'm beginning to think I should do humalog (according to BG reading) before every snack no matter how small.I haven't done C peptide test yet but have order.\u00a0\u00a0Do I have to forego insulin 24 hours prior to test?Sorry to be so needy but don't get much help from endo.\u00a0\u00a0She looks at numbers and says they're too high, that will be $200 please.\u00a0\u00a0Wouldn't need her at all except for rx and my next A1C will be from Wal Mart, cost $12.95.No good complaining about her, this is in my hands. It's inspiring that you gained control.\u00a0\u00a0Do you do insulin frequently?Thanks Zoe!\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate your efforts on behalf.Kittyface",
