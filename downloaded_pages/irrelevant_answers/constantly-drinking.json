            "answer": "Hello, Andrea.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Juvenile diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the body's pancreas ceases to function properly.\u00a0\u00a0The pancreas produces two primary proteins, the most important of which is insulin.\u00a0\u00a0When you eat, food is broken down into it's basic elements to be digested, the most basic of which is glucose.\u00a0\u00a0The body uses glucose in muscles, for energy, and in the brain, to support basic functions.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin is the protein that takes that glucose and delivers it to the cells that use it.\u00a0\u00a0When the pancreas stops producing insulin, the body doesn't have the ability to get that energy it needs from it's normal routes, and that creates the symptoms that people see.Here are a list of the symptoms:http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000305.htm#SymptomsThe primary ones most people see are weight loss, extreme thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue.You certainly have a problem on your hands, with his autism.\u00a0\u00a0Does he sleep soundly?\u00a0\u00a0It's possible to do a simple blood sugar test with a glucose meter to get a decent idea of whether or not he has diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise, all I can recommend is that you figure out a way to restrain him with enough people.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know enough about autism to be able to suggest a way to do it that you haven't already thought of.\u00a0\u00a0The blood draw doesn't take too long, but you definitely have your challenges.\u00a0\u00a0I'd definitely recommend you get him tested.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

            "answer": "My suggestion is like the above, see if they can check his blood sugar on a blood glucose meter at your doctor's office.\u00a0\u00a0I think it is painfree (but I have been doing it for 14 years) and alot easier than a blood draw.\u00a0\u00a0It is a simple finger poke and then putting that blood on a test strip.\u00a0\u00a0This will give the doctors more of an idea what they are dealing with and where to go from there.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure how he will react to this with his autism but I have checked my 3 year old sons blood sugar several times and it doesn't bother him at all.\u00a0\u00a0In fact he sticks his finger out for me whenever I get my meter out to check my blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you can get something figured out soon!",

    "question": "My 4 year old seems to be constantly thirsty..he can go through a gallon of fluid a day if we let him.. Someone I talked to mentioned this may be juvenile diabetes.. What is juvenile diabetes and what are other symptoms? We thought maybe he was dehydrated thats why he was drinking so much but we took away any juices and milk and he still drank as much.. The doctor hasn't been able to do any blood work on him because he freaks out every time we try to go and he has autism so we can't explain really to him whats happening..They tried restraining him to get the blood work and he even got out of that..I don't know what to do I am really concerned about this.. Other things he does show is he pees a lot but really strong odor like if you were dehydrated..but i thought that the peeing was just cause he drinks a lot.. he has quite a few specialists he sees or is scheduled to see because of the autism but no one can offer any insight to the constant thirst..He is on 2 meds Melatonin 3mg and Clonidine 4 ml at bed its a liquid the tabs they used to make it are .1 mgplease help",
