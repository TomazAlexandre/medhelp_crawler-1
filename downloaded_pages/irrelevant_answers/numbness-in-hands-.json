            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The symptoms could be due to nerve compression or peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or hypothyroidism. The compression can be anywhere at cervical spine, or shoulder or elbow or at wrist. Please get your blood pressure and tests for diabetes and hypothyroidism done. Fatigue and drowsiness can also be due to sleep apnea. It can also be due to more weight. Please discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
