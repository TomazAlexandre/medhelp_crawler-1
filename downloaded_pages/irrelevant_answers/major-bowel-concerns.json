            "answer": "Honestly I would ask for a colonoscopy or at least a sigmoidscopy. This doesn't sound normal so the drs really should be more than doing a urine test.I also think you should get tested for diabetes- sometimes that can cause foul smelling urine. Also perhaps it's worth it to rule out food allergies- like gluten?Either way, don't let your dr's ignore you on this. Hopefully it's nothing more then hemorrhoids, but really it's not worth the risk.",

            "answer": "Black stools typically indicate a bleed further up in the GI tract and it bears further investigation - as ducky above mentions, a colo/end-oscopy or other investigation to determine the source of the bleed seems like a reasonable next step.",
