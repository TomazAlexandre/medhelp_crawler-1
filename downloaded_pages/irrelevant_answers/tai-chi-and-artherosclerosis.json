            "answer": "Tai Che is a very old relaxation method developed by the Chinese culture and has been around for thousands of years. It there were no benefits, I am sure it would have gone out of style many centuries ago. People I know swear by it's healthful effects on the mind and body.\u00a0\u00a0Science knows that stress does break down the body and has many bad side effects to our health. Relaxation and body movement have been linked to positive reversals for poor health.\u00a0\u00a0What it will do for you as an individual is not known, but it is certainly worth a try. If your mind relaxes, your body will follow.\u00a0\u00a0You will sleep better, have a better outlook on life in general and be happier. These positive changes may promote better body functions and increased healing may occur. Don't expect immediate physical changes, but there may be changes over time.",

            "answer": "Qigong is the father of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which is over 5000 years old.\u00a0\u00a0When the Yellow Emperor spoke about his secrets of longevity, his students listened and wrote them down.\u00a0\u00a0He fathered 25 children and was vital and powerful even at the age of 100.\u00a0\u00a0Aside from the use of high energy foods and herbs, the Yellow Emperor\u2019s main secret was Qigong.Many Qigong practitioners show profound anti-aging effects, often looking decades younger than their actual age.\u00a0\u00a0Some also possess an incredible ability to heal other people.\u00a0\u00a0Most notably Qigong is used to for improving digestion (bigger bowel movements/enhanced detoxification), strengthening blood circulation, keeping a strong immune system and overall - extending lifespan.How does Qigong accomplish this?\u00a0\u00a0Simple... Qi moves the blood.\u00a0\u00a0It improves microcirculation to the brain, vital organs, intestines, endocrine glands and moves blood to avenues of microcirculation that most people are not realizing.\u00a0\u00a0 This increased Qi or Bloodflow leads to the accumulation of what Chinese Medicine calls \u201cJing\u201d or special fluids (hormones).\u00a0\u00a0 And although this may sound like a Qigong commercial, this leads to an increased sex drive, higher levels of secretion of growth hormone and extraordinary muscular endurance.\u00a0\u00a0 It is quite possibly the most powerful form of exercise on Earth.Its recent surge in popularity has been a result of Qigong\u2019s fun and dynamic movements of practice. Magnetic energy fields are formed and created in a slow graceful manner. The Qi literally throbs and pulsates in your hands. Some say it\u2019s the most tangible experience of the spiritual life force energy. Our particular style of Qigong yields a strong \u201cQi Feeling\u201d in minutes, even for the skeptical non believer.In closing, the best schools of Qigong give precise instruction. A clear understanding is required in order to increase the Qi and blood flow enough to get the benefits described above. Our Qigong DVD\u2019s show the \u201cedges of the energy field\u201d and this allows for a highercomprehension of what exactly needs to be done in Qigong for it to actually be effective. Clear language, precise teaching technology and the best techniques have come together",
