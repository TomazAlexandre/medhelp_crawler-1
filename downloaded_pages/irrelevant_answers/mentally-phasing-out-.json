    "question": "I am Type 2 but not yet on insulin. Off and on I have periods when I won't remember most of my drive to work or my drive home.\u00a0\u00a0I try to ensure that I eat and have plenty of water, but when I'm stressed and not sleeping or eating right is when I notice it much more. It's happening again and I'm under a great deal of work stress, not eating much and not sleeping well (no energy). I also get more migraines during this period. Is this normal?",
