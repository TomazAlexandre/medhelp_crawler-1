            "answer": "I too am having something similar . For years, I was subject to Bladder Infections but with Menopause they have been less frequent. I also have Diabetes\u00a0\u00a0type 2, Fibro ( or possibly Arthritis or both) ,HBP, Osteopenia and IBS.\u00a0\u00a0In the last 2-3 mos. I have had a burning off and on , most noticibly in my Urethrea but at times it seems to spread to my abdomen. The odd thing is, this usually starts after going to bed, and often lets up during the day. Sometimes, if I change positions it lets up for a bit.More recently, my mouth also burns which I have had with the IBS befor. I don't know if this is a combination of several different things or what.No fever or nausea and don't feel too bad except for loss of sleep at night but that is due to the Fibro or osteo, in part at least and the burning. Last night I was fine but woke up at 2 A. M. , made a trip to the bathroom to urinate and then it started.Has anyone had a problem with coffee affecting them in this way ? At one time ( years ago ) a DR. told me i had a very Acidic systemHave a Physical comming up in\u00a0\u00a0a few days so will see what the Dr. says.PJ",
