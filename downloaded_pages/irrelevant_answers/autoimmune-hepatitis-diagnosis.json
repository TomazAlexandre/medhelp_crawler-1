            "answer": "Hi Jody,Thanks!I know, it is very weird. Up to 1 year ago I was just fine and healthy and now I am so many issues at once!!! I can deal with all the other issues. I am learning, reading and getting as much as I can about them and I can make good decisions based on my conversations with the doctors but I am concerned about the AIH Diagnosis... the treatment is very intense and I am not sure if I would go for it. I really would like to understand the meaning of so many positive antibodies and other issues for AIH and still the liver biopsy doesn't show that it is AIH (at least that is what I doctor told me). Anyway.. I will keep reseraching. Thanks again!!!\u00a0\u00a0Debora",

            "answer": "Hi Debora!I am not any doctor, but I think it is possible that you have AIH. The liver biopsy may result like yours when the AIH just began, so your liver is not so affected. My husband has a liver biopsy just like yours. I sugges you see another doctor and start getting some medication. Good luck and hope to hear well from you. Drian",

            "answer": "Hi Drian!Thanks! Do you remember your husband's results?? Anything related to granuloma or something similar? Was he dignosed in the beginning stages? I am going to see another doctor soon. My first reaction and after reading a lot about the treatment is to not go for the treatment yet. You see I am Type 1 Diabetic on Insulin Pump, I have heart disease (taking nitrates) and other complications and the treatment itself seems to be very heard. I am researching other forms of treatment before I make my decision. My best wishes for you and your husband. Please keep us posted so we can learn with your experiences! Any aditional information is always helpful and useful! Debora",

            "answer": "Thank you for your concern. Well after almost a year of tests and doctor's visits I was send to SHANDS and there the dr. confirmed that I have AIH. I am currently on treament my Liver Enzimes came back to normal which is a relief. I have to say that I've learned a lot in this past year. I've read, spoke to a doctor friend of mine overseas, asked opinion from his fellow doctor's... Fortunately as I understand liver has a enormous capacity of regeneration but we can't rely on that and just ignore whatever is going on. The biggest challenge for me was make a decision about a treatment that would not do more harm than good and I spend months trying to make my mind, taking in consideration the fact that I don't have only one issue going on... I think I mentioned in my first message... I was a very healthy 39 years old woman and all the sudden I've got so sick that I can't even start to number the symptoms...I was speechless to find our that I not only had Diabetes but Type 1 Diabetes! My pancreas went from producing insulin to not producing at all in a matter of weeks!!! and I am not kidding! I am very thin person, my diet was always good (I have my chocolate weakness :D ) and not one single person in my family had health issues that we could say comes close to what I am facing. At the same time I was Diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes, I was also diagnosed with SLE overlaped with Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (now controled with same medication for AIH), Thyroid Hashimoto, Sjogrens Syndrome (beggining stages and not active), Moderate Myocardial Ischemia, Hiatal Hernia, Ulcer, Linchen Sclerosis, gallbladder issues, and now the confirmation of AIH... it is almost unbelievable! As I had my appts with dr. they would say that I was an \"interesting case\"... not fun I have to say. I guess something trigged my body to respond by attacking itself all at once... it has been a long journey and many times painful between the diseases symptoms and medicines side effects but I don't give up. God graciously has helped me to be strong and to make lemonade with my lemons and I try to be encouraging to everyone that I have a chance to talk to... life is too short and sometimes too hard to be lived alone or whitout hope. Between my loving husband, my 5 years old son and God's grace, I am able to live a blessed life. I agree with you, take charge of your health, do your home work before and after you talk to you doctors and be firm, ask questions, research all the medicines side effects and ask for alternatives... I've done that I so far it has worked for me. I hope to hear from you soon. I am interested in find out how was your visit with your doctor. Also, we have very nice ladies in this comunity that are going through the same problem and they are great at comforting you when you think that you are alone when it comes all the pains and aches that that disease brings.God bless!",

    "question": "Hello,I am a 39 years old female. I was diagnosed 5 months ago with Type 1 Diabetes and Hashimoto's Disease. I was also checked positive for\u00a0\u00a0SLE and Sjogrens and I have Linchen Sclerosis.For the past 12 months my liver enzimes are elevated (not to much, about 2 or max 3 times normal limits). I have a ANA positive (titer 1:160), ASMA Positive, I had a Liver Biposy done and the results came back as \"rare isolated focus of non-caseating granuloma and rare focus of chronic inflammation of lobule with minimal chronic inflammation of portal triads, no accumulation of iron or fibrosis\".\u00a0\u00a0My doctor was not able to give me a final diagnosis yet. As I understand my liver biopsy doesn't show that I have AIH so my question is : Is it possible to have ANA positive, ASMA positive, elevated liver enzimes, joint pain, nausea, liver biopsy negative and still don't have AIH?? In this case why do I have ANA and ASMA positive?? Are they signs of something else besides AIH?? Can someone give me some ideas, please??? I want to make an educated decision when I talk to my doctor again, especially taking in consideration the fact that the treatment for AIH will be very hard on my body, as being Diabetic. Thanks for your time!!!",
