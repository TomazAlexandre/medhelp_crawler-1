            "answer": "Neosporin, polysporin or an over the counter bactricidal agent might have been the proper treatment at the beginning, however the \"pinkness\" suggests infection, and if it's been there this long you probably require an oral antibiotic, and possibly debridement of the wound.Infection of this nature is not necessarily due to anemia. A healthy person who has the misfortune to be infected with certain bacteria can also develop such a problem. Aloe vera will not cure an infection and will only delay you receiving proper care.There is always a possibility such an infection can spread to the bloodstream and settle on the heart valves, so the appropriate course of action is to visit a physician for an evaluation and treatment. I would worry about this.",

    "question": "Hi,I'm a 17 year old male with cuts on the hands that haven't healed. It originally was 1 cut on the top of my back of hand/wrist. I got it over a month ago from scrapping my hand as I took my hockey bag out of my car. Since them I've gotten 2 cuts on both my index fingers (1 each) and all cuts have never fully healed just becoming pink and having a scab. -Mike",
