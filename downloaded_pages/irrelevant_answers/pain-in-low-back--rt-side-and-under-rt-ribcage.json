            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you are also having a swelling, the rule out abscess (localized collection of pus), inflammation of the muscles, pinched spinal nerves and muscle pull. It could also be a liver or gall bladder problem. Consult an urologist or nephrologist to evaluate the kidney status. Maybe you can seek another opinion.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. A CT scan or MRI can be done to know the cause of swelling.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I need some help. I am having very intense pain in the right lower side of my back (where my kidney is), my right side and under my ribcage on the right side. It has been going on for over a month. I was told a month ago I had a kidney infection, it was successfully treated. Recent tests show my kidney is supposedly fine. However, it continues to be swollen, bulging out of my back, and is causing me great pain. I have been a diabetic since the age of 4, which has now been 38 years. I have been to doctors over and over, emergency rooms on several occasions, and have been told I must have an angry kidney. Can a kidney infection really cause this much prolonged pain? I have had them in the past and have never had it bulging out of my back, not during the infection and certainly not for weeks after. What else could it be? I am afraid they are just blaming my diabetes and the kidney infection and failing to look at any other possible causes. Any suggestions?",
