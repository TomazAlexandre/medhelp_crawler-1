            "answer": "I am a 35 year old male and I have the exact same problem. After eating greasy food like things sauteed in butter or pizza, I will \"burp\" up large quantities of pure, crystal clear, orange grease. Nothing else, just grease that looks exactly like the stuff that pools on top of a pepperoni pizza. I, however, am not a healthy weight. I weigh in around 325 and have type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Here is the kicker thought, My cholesterol is PERFECT. Bad is non existent and good is right where it should be. It's like my body has a filter on it and after the food has passed, the \"bad\" grease comes back up.",

    "question": "Hi, I have always wondered why this happens and hoping to get a clearer understanding, but since I can remember, after eating a particularly oily meal (specifically fried or animal fat such as bacon) I basically spit out pure oil pretty much 15 -30 min after ingesting. No food particals either -just the oil. It is literally like a filtering system. .\u00a0\u00a0Note, this does not happen if i have raw healthy oils. Is this a liver condition or just reflux? I am a healthjy 30yr old female. I appreciate any ideas!",
