            "answer": "I'd say drink some orange juice, it might make you feel better. If the burning feeling gets worse then it's acid reflux and tums or mylanta will help. You can drink milk to calm it as well but milk on top of orange juice is enough to make me puke lol just lay however you can get comfy and stay hydrated. Also ask your dr about something for nausea, mine gave me zofran.",

            "answer": "I drank orange juice about an hour before I started feeling this way.. & yeah, usually milk is the only thing that helps my heartburn and acid reflex. I just don't want to drink it on top of it. I just wish I could calm down.. I get like this if I think I'm gonna throw up and I think that's what is making me shake. && thanks!",
