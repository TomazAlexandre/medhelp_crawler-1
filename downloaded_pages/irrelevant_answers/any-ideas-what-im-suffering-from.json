When the crystal cycle (salt, ions, and flouride) is weak and immune system does not link well with a healthy heart, the vision and body reports to what you have. Yoga and simple j-pullies can help build this link, however at least 12hours is required. Also, check for stress and harm. Then avoid the previous.",

    "question": "as far as I know, my symptoms may be unrelated, but they all seem to have arrived together. firstly, I have chronic heartburn which is hardly affected by beta blockers. I also have trouble sleeping, because seemingly random parts of my body go numb when I lie still (including my limbs, and quite often my tongue). Thirdly, bright lights have strated causing glare in my vision, accompanied by migraine-type headaches (these headaches also accompany the numbness I feel when I lie still). These are the major symptoms, but a few minor ones accompany them. for example, I seem to have very poor circulation, and cuts on my hand are taking months to heal. does anyone have ANY idea what's wrong with me? I'm sick of being dismissed by doctors. Thank you.",
