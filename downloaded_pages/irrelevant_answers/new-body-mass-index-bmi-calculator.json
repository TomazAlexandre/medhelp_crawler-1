            "answer": "I think the BMI calculator is great and will really be helpful for everyone, but particularly for \"newbies\" that are trying to get started.\u00a0\u00a0Is there any way you can add how many calories/day I would need to maintain my current weight/BMI; then, knowing that I would have to create a calorie deficit in order to lose weight, I would have a good starting point?It would be great to have a food journal and calorie counter and something that would tell me how many calories I used doing certain activities (i.e. walked 1 mile, used 100 calories).I do have a question also - my PCP delights in telling me that as I get older, I will automatically gain weight - so if that's correct, should I, at age 59, be expected to have the same BMI as someone who is ?Thanks for the considerations.",
