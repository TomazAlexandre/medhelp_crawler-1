            "answer": "accorrding to my doctor when you go along time without knowing your blood sugar is high, your body wil automatically adjust to that and you will feel normal even though its unhealthy. so when you blood sugar drops to what would be a good or \"healthy\" range to be in your body thinks it doesn't have enough sugar. I would definatly see a doctor asap. they will probablly put you on some kind of medicine such metformin and some kind of diet. it will take time but you need to start getting your numbers lower, cause when your sugar is that high for long periods of time, it starts sticking to your oragons and starts to eat at them. Thats what they just told me in the hospital. Hope can get some answers soon.",
