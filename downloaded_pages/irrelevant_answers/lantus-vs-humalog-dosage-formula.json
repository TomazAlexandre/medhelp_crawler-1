            "answer": "My 6 year old son was diagnosed type 1 30 days ago (Oct 2). I understand it's really apples to oranges trying to compare a new pediatric Type 1 who may be Honeymooning with an lifelong adult, but anything may be helpful for you.He's a big healthy boy, 57 pounds. Per UCLA Med Center we are currently dosing him 8 units of Lantus split to 5 units in the AM before school, then 3 units about 2 hours before bedtime), with a bedtime BG check. We also are giving 1 unit Humalog per carb unit. We found the thigh for him is the best place for the Lantus. Stomach absorption rate was too fast.It's early in the game but this so far is working quite well for us. During the initial 15 days we administered first 12, then 10 Lantus all at night, as recommended. We found he was drifting into the 60 and sometimes 40s at times during the night. This split has really helped keep him in 70s for his morning BG. We are told the Lantus has a small peak at around 2 hours, so that's the reason for the 2 hours before bedtime with the BG check just before bed.",

            "answer": "I am an adult female in my 40's who has been a type 1 diabetic since childhood. My dosage is identical to yours. I believe that your morning highs are because the Lantus is indeed petering out while you sleep. From what I have read about Lantus, it works BETWEEN 20-24 hours. In my case, too, it does not last a full 24 hours. I do split my dose and achieve excellent control this way.Ask your doctor about doing this. Of course you cannot do it overnight because the previous day's Lantus is already at work, and so it has to be done one unit at a time over several days. The way that my doctor had me do it was to reduce the morning dose by one unit on the first day, and that night I added a unit. We waited several days to see how this would work as my body adjusted to the routing -- we need to see patterns and not just one-time results. Then a few days later, I reduced the morning by one more unit and added another unit. Waited a few more days, etc. When your morning sugars are running where you want them on a routine basis, your split is correct and you stop changing the dosage. For me, 8 units in the morning and 2-3 at night turned out to be the ideal. My identical twin needs to split her dosage more like half and half. Each person is different.",

            "answer": "Hello everyone, new to this forum. My name is Tom I'm 32 years old and have had diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes, type 1) for 24 years. I've been a pump user for almost 6 years now, but recently lost my health insurance and was forced to go back to injection because of costs for pump supplies. First off I hate it, not because needles hurt etc... actually using a pump it's more critical to make time for blood glucose monitoring. I just hate it because my control isn't anywhere near as good with sliding scale injections of Humalog for meals and a shot of Lantus at night to act as a basal rate. My first recommendation would be to get in to see a \"diabetes specialist, endocrinologist. I've had some hyperglycemia in the mornings, but nothing as high as 500 and I feel crummy so I'm sure you must not be feeling your best. And secondly I wouldn't recommend the splitting of your Lantus dose just because of the long lasting time frame, even if Lantus only lasted for say 18 hours you'd be getting a bunch of overlap somewhere in your day or night. Instead I'd tell you (and I'm not a doctor) to take your Lantus at bedtime that way you'll be sure to have it at full strength in the AM and if it does start to fizzle out, it will be later after dinner or toward your next where you are more likely to catch your blood sugar on the rise and can correct it with Humalog. Just don't make any huge dosing changes I had to slowly adjust my Lantus dose up higher with the help of my physician until I got my AM readings where I like them. Basically just adding 1-2 units of Lantus at a time and remember anyone can have a high blood sugar ounce in a while due to diet, stress, infection so don't just add insulin look for a pattern where a high blood glucose reading is happening over and over before you try to change it. And insulin pumps are definately tough enough to be used on a farm. I'm an automotive technician and crawl on top of and underneath cars all day long. just use common sense and make sure the infusion set is protected and the pump itself is tucked away ina pocket or better yet one of the hard shell clip on cases and you'd have no problems. I cannot wait to get back on mine next week. Good luck.",

I am not the best person to follow doctors orders and never have normal bloodsugars. I take my lantus at night and when i first started taking it my dose was 35 and sliding scale with humalog whenever i ate. I dropped low middle of night and close to the max. end normal range. Now i take 5 units humalog when i eat a full meal and adjust it as needed , my lantus is 15-25 units depending on the bs level\u00a0\u00a0and what i ate last before i took the lantus. My sugars were starting to fall into the almost normal range.It jsut depends on the diet and control of your diabetes to come to a set amount of insulin to take so that u do not drop or rise to drastically. good luck, aleciacs",
