            "answer": "Well, if your symptoms are worsening hypo symptoms with your TSH going down, we have to start thinking about secondary hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0This is actually a pituitary dysfunction, where the pituitary doesn't put out enough TSH to stimulate the thyroid to produce hormone.\u00a0\u00a0The result is an underactive thyroid, even though the root cause is pituitary.Your other AI diseases could be raising your TPOab.Do you know the cause of the rest of your family's hypo?",

            "answer": "Your T4, which is total T4, is below range.\u00a0\u00a0This tells us that your thyroid is not producing enough hormone.\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore ranges for T3 and T4 are very flawed, and most of us found we didn't feel well until T4 was about the middle of the range and T3 the upper half of range.\u00a0\u00a0So, what at first glance looks just a little low is worse than it appears.With below range T4, we would expect your TSH to be much higher than it is.\u00a0\u00a0So, secondary hypothyroidism is highly probable.Do you think your PCP would agree to treat you?What you should try to find is a good thyroid doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, being an endo doesn't guarantee that a doctor is a good thyroid doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Many endos are only interested in treating diabetes and don't really keep up on thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0It usually pays to interview them over the phone a bit before making an appointment.\u00a0\u00a0At least, you can rule out the worst of the worst that way.\u00a0\u00a0I can give you some suggestions on what to ask if you're interested.",

Yes I would love direction on how to pick a good thyroid doctor.I called my PCP after posting earlier....he stated that since my TSH is within normal range even though it's low-it doesn't matter that my T4 is low, I need no further testing, or specialist!It makes me so angry! I feel most doctors don't listen and don't care.I do believe I do not need a referral with my insurance.",

            "answer": "Unfortunately, most doctors think TSH is the ultimate in thyroid testing.\u00a0\u00a0That couldn't be further from the truth, but you can't convince them of that.You'll probably have to interview the doctor through a nurse.\u00a0\u00a0An especially rabid receptionist will probably try to keep you away from the nurses, too, but that usually only lasts until she realizes she has no clue how to answer your question.\u00a0\u00a0The first question I'd ask is which tests the doctor usually orders for his hypo patients.\u00a0\u00a0You want to hear FT3, FT4 and TSH.\u00a0\u00a0If they say they only order TSH...run!Another good question is which meds they are open to using.\u00a0\u00a0Some doctors are \"T4 only\" (Synthroid, Levoxyl and generics) people, some will use both synthetic T3 (Cytomel and generics) and synthetic T4, and some will use desiccated porcine thyroid (Armour, NatureThroid, Erfa, just to name a few) as well.\u00a0\u00a0These are our three basic treatment options, and it's really great when a doctor is open to all three.\u00a0\u00a0Practically speaking, however, most fall into either the synthetic or the desiccated camp.\u00a0\u00a0Steer clear of the ones who only use T4.You can also ask if they treat mostly diabetes.I agree most don't listen and/or don't care.\u00a0\u00a0Their chief concern is staying out of litigation.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms are subjective.\u00a0\u00a0So, they can cover their backsides by refusing to treat if your numbers are in range.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, in their last joint position paper, AACE and ATA reaffirmed that TSH was the gold standard in thyroid testing.\u00a0\u00a0So, if your TSH is in range, they're perfectly justified in denying treatment.",

My TSH numbers have been progressively dropping for 2 yrs-started at a4!I asked Dr to do t3& t4 also, but did not get any results for them and can't call to inquire until monday...It just seems I'm right on the brink of abnormal, and with so many symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas or thoughts out there?",
