            "answer": "Although stress can always cause nonspecific symptoms of fatigue and paresthesias in feet and hands especially with hyperventilation, I always want to make sure I'm not missing something neurologic that can potentially be fixed. I'm glad your tests have been normal. Other things that may need to be looked at include tests for diabetes and an EMG. The EMG may be important in your case to make sure there's nothing going on with the peripheral nerves in your arms and legs as they can sometimes feel prickly and tingly with demyelinating conditions of the perihperal nerves like chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy or Guillain Barre syndrome (your symptoms have gone on too long for this one). At any rate, the neurology exam should be help point your neurologist in the right direction as to what tests to order. Good luck.",

    "question": "Up until recently I assumed myself to be a healthy 35 year old female in good condition physically, but beginning in June I started experiencing the following symptoms(mostly at night):\u00a0\u00a0parathesia in feet and lower legs,pin ***** sensations in the finger tips,irritable bowel syndrome, internal nerveousness (not noticible outwardly),burning in the veins in my forearms and back of hands (when this happens the veins are very distended), cramping across the tops of thighs and tenderness on the inside of both knees.These symptoms vary day to day and sometimes do not last very long(few minutes to a few hours).I have had MRI's done of the head (normal),neck(some straightening, but no compression),lower back(dextroscoliosis, no compression),x-rays done of pelvic area (experiencing discomfort across left pelvic crest),x-rays of back(normal except dextroscoliosis),ANA, HIV, Thyroid, Sedrate, B12, Sjogrens, White/Red Blood Counts, Rheumatoid Arthritis, all normal.Eyes checked for optic neuritis-none found (concerned about MS).I have had no muscle weakness.I am on Zestril for high blood pressure and have been taking 3 baby asprin a day to help with any inflammation there may be in the veins (seems to help).Doctor believes this is all stress related(a lot of stress in my life right now),but have a consultation with a Neurologist and a Rheumatologist upcoming.\u00a0\u00a0Can stress alone produce these symptoms or am I missing something?\u00a0\u00a0What else can we possibly check for? It's good to know that everything is coming back normal, but doesn't explain symptoms.Thank you for any direction.",
