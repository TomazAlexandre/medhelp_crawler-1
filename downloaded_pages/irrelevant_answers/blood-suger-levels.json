            "answer": "Hi,your levels seem very high. Although I am not used to your units.You may need to work very closely with your doctor and you may need a fast acting insulin before meals and/or further adjustment of your basal insulin.Portion control, carbohydrate counting, and exercise will all help.However with such high levels I think you need to be talking to your doctor and asking to be referreed to a diabetes educator.Read up all you can about diabetes and start applying it.\u00a0\u00a0With such high levels your risk of complications is very high.",
