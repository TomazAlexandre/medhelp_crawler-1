            "answer": "What has your doctor actually checked you for? Do you have a list of the bloodwork actually ran? Did they consider checking your immune system and your liver and kidneys too? Usually they run the basic CMP and CBC panels, but not always anything else. If that is the case, and you have suffered hair lost, and cortisone has helped it come back...maybe it is time to head off too a specialist. There are so many things going on here that a general doctor might be able to help, but if your internist cannot think of anything try a rheumatologist maybe? It is worth a shot.Peace and feel better soon",

    "question": "Hi, I am a 24 yr old woman and I have had some strange symptoms over the last year.\u00a0\u00a0Basically the main ones have been :- insomnia- alopecia ariata (bald spot found on head)- unintentional weight lossother random things I have noticed :- frequent urination- excessive thirst- feeling faint (only once, was about to faint but quickly sat down and put my head btw my legs)I went to dermatologist and internist mainly about bald spot and mood changes at the time (which i since think were due to getting on and then off of birth control pill)... my blood tests came back all normal both times. I still feel that something is not quite right, but not sure if I should go back to the dr or just write it off as a weird year and hope things improve. Hair is growing back now due to cortisone injections I have been receiving and insomnia is not as consistent as it had been.Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!Erin",
