            "answer": "My sister saw the heartbeat at 8 weeks with her first, then miscarried at 12 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0With this past miscarriage she was 11w4d and had yet to have a U/S, so she did not hear or see the heartbeat.\u00a0\u00a0They told her the baby stopped growing at 9 weeks.If you saw the baby at 11 weeks, then I do not think that you have anything to worry about.Have you looked up the stats on miscarriage after 11 weeks?",
