            "answer": "Hello Henry.Heart disease is usually associated with hypertension and diabetes mellitus. These three diseases together form a triad. Each disease increases the other's risk.I suspect diabetic neuropathy in him. The symptoms of diabetic neuropathy usually start in the feet and hands. The symptoms are numbness, tingling, pain or burning with or without weakness. Slowly the neuropathy spreads to other parts of the body.Please mention the triad to him. He should get diabetes and blood pressure checked.I am glad you are concerned about your boss ! I hope he is able to find the cause behind his symptoms.RegardsRegards",

    "question": "Doctor,My boss had a stent put in a few months back after a stress test showed he had 90% blockage. The procedure went smoothly however, now his feet stay constantly numb. He cant feel anything in them and trips over things all the time. He is COMPLETELY frustrated and the doctors will not give him any answers. Now his hands are starting to go numb. He just got back from another neurology appointment and he said that they sat on a computer in front of him and tried to \"google\" the answer. Im very worried about him and since hes not very computer literate he doesnt do any research online. Is this normal? What could possilby be causing this pain and numbness?I hope you can give us some insight.Thanks,Henry",
