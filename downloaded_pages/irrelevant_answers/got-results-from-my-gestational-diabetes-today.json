Im a bit stressed about it, I have had so many problems during this pregnancy with rashes, and infections and generally getting every symptom in the book lol. I just hope that I don't have this on top of everything else.",

            "answer": "well there is an EXTREMELY high rate of people who fail or borderline fail the 1 hr glucose test.\u00a0\u00a0As I said I've failed it with THREE pregnancies.\u00a0\u00a0You have a very good chance of passing the 3 hr.\u00a0\u00a0Honestly, I wouldn't worry about it until you find out the results from this next test.\u00a0\u00a0Besides if the doc is saying you are borderline on your 1 hr, that means you didn't really go over the level, you were probably right at it, which is a REALLY good sign and gives you an increased chance that you will pass the 3 hr.\u00a0\u00a0I know it's easier said than done, but try to relax and don't get worked up just yet...wait and see what the 3 hr results are.",
