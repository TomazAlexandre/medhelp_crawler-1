            "answer": "I write this not just for you but for anyone out there that may benefit from my story.\u00a0\u00a0Be careful with thyroid and make sure her Doc doesn't change her thyroid meds without running consecutive tests on he thryroid levels.\u00a0\u00a0I've been through hell and back this past year with my mother and her thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0She began having memory loss slowly but in Jan '08 she started getting confused, had auditory psychosis, severe memory loss, depressed and we lived with it sad day after sad day. Psychiatrists and Dr's told us it was most likely the beginning of Alzheimer's.\u00a0\u00a0 We were scared and yet I wouldn't give up, Alzheimer's doesn't come on that fast, she did say her Doc had changed her diabetes meds and after researching on the net and crying myself to sleep most every\u00a0\u00a0late night I came to the conclusion that diabetes doens't cause what she was going through it had to be her thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0I finally called the pharmacist and he confirmed the Doc had increased her thyroid meds not her diabetes meds.\u00a0\u00a0 A few days later we could see a change and she slowly came back to us yet not 100% her memory took a beating.\u00a0\u00a0I confronted the Doc and he said he had run a test once and noticed she needed her synthroid increased! Once will not determine anything, you need to have your levels checked over the course of a few weeks to have comparisons. If your mother is going through memory loss keep having her levels checked before they change anything! We are now trying to switch her to Armour slowly which is natural thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and keep your eyes open to any changes.\u00a0\u00a0If her memory isn't the greatest like my mothers was she may easily misunderstand.",

            "answer": "I totally identify with this.\u00a0\u00a0I'm going through this right now with my mother.She is in her late 70's and been hypo for several years.\u00a0\u00a0She has an HMO and has always been managed by her primary doc.\u00a0\u00a0She's never had significant relief from exhuastion, sleep problems, feeling cold, thinning hair etc.\u00a0\u00a0When I asked, she always told me that the dr. said her levels were fine.Over the past two months or so her memory and confusion got worse.\u00a0\u00a0Also, the fatigue and cold are terrible.\u00a0\u00a0She has a \"funny\" feeling in her hands and feet.A month ago they increased her synthroid.\u00a0\u00a0No improvement.\u00a0\u00a0She want went to doc and he said wait another month.\u00a0\u00a0Now I'm trying to get consents signed so I can call the dr office myself and talk to them.\u00a0\u00a0I will be going to her appts. from now on (she doesn't understand as well and can't relay back to me what was said).I just don't understand how she has all these symptoms, and the dr. says her tests are all normal.\u00a0\u00a0Did the guy even run t3 and t4?\u00a0\u00a0 I'll find out.The memory issues are scary and upsetting to see in your parent, especially suddenly.\u00a0\u00a0I read the same thing about hypoT and the elderly, which is why I intend on pursing this, too.Hang in there.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully you'll find answers.",

I nearly lost my mind when she began having memory loss and confusion.\u00a0\u00a0You can't ever imagine your once powerful and strong parent decline and therefore hand over the care giving to you when it's been the other way around all your life.\u00a0\u00a0I have another appointment in 2 weeks so we'll see.\u00a0\u00a0This Dr deals with natural and western medicine so hopefully best of both worlds.\u00a0\u00a0If anything comes up, I'll be here to chat.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

            "answer": "To answer your question............ (just speaking from personal experience) but If synthroid caused memory loss then I would have it. I take 400 mg a day and was on 300mg of synthroid for many years. I was in an out of the hospital on IV getting synthroid.\u00a0\u00a0Then i was required to come to Duke Hospital every other day for months and take 1200mg of synthroid per day.\u00a0\u00a0Acutally my memory improved when i was on high doses of it.",
