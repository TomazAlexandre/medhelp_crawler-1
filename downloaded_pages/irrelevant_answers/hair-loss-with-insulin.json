            "answer": "Sometimes hair loss is a symptom of uncontrolled diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Give yourself a chance to adjust to your new routine of insulin, diet and exercise and see if the condition doesn't improve.Stress can certainly cause it, too, and new diabetics -- or those who undergo a treatment change -- often feel pretty stressed about it all.Wish I had more info to offer than \"wait & see.\"\u00a0\u00a0Do check with your endocrinologist since thyroid issues can be an underlying cause, too.\u00a0\u00a0Many of us diabetics also have thyroid issues.",

            "answer": "I am a 22yr old female who has had type 1 diabetes for 11 years. For the first 6 or 7 yrs my bs levels were tightly controlled and then for various reasons... becoming of ages, moving out of home, attending college, moving overseas etc etc my sugars are no longer well controlled. In regards to hair loss - myself and my family & friends have noticed a severe change in my hair - it is now very, very thin and lacking the natural healthy shine that it once had. The only thing i can suggest is that it is closly related with poor contol. I am making every effort to improve this... and crossing my fingers i can repair ths damage and see a result with my hair. This is just my assumption and if anyone else has any suggestions i'd appreciate them. I empathise - it is quite embarressing. Good Luck to you.",

            "answer": "Hi,I am 24 years old and i have been a diabetic since 21 years of my life. I have never had any problems with hair loss due to bad sugar controls. In fact, i hv long, nourished, and silky hair, touch wood. Many a times, my sugar level is high... but I don't see any difference in my hair.I would suggest that it depends on the type of shampoo that you use. Some ingrediants in a shampoo brand may not suit a diabetic's body as compared to others. Take an opinion from your health practitioner on the type of shampoo that you should use so as to get rid of this problem ASAP.Could you revert back with the solution you get and if at all your hair loss problem reduces or revereses completely?Thanks.Good luck! Hope all works well for you.Take care.",

            "answer": "Hi, I am 21 years old and have suffered with type 1 for 4 years now. For the first 2 years I took excellent care of myself and had thick shiny hair but after some time I developed a rare eating disorder called diabulemia whereby type 1 diabetics skip or under dose on insulin to lose weight. I was never fat, but I was overly obsessed with controlling my weight with diet, exercise and eventually this dangerous habit. After 2 years my hair fell out noticeably and now I am on the road to recovering from my bad habits as a result. All i can say is that you have to watch your blood sugars very closely and ask your doctor to run a blood testosterone test on you, as an imbalance in testosterone can make the situation worse. As long as you are making 100% effort to control your BG, a few high BG's now and then should not effect your hair, however, if your BG levels are consistently high, this will propose a problem.Hope I helped and hope you can solve your problem :]",

I experienced hair fall (massive) prior to my DM diagnosis and little by little until i had no hair left in my entire body. My dr says it might be due to several reasons. It may be due to extreme stress (my father was diagnosed with cancer and just died), low immune system or maybe due to my previous medical condition which is typhoid fever. Now, Im on steroids dow controlling my sugars just to cope up with my alopecia and self esteem. My hair is back now! I am strictly contrling my sugars, too since t may also be due to uncontrolled sugar before...I believe stress is a big factor to hair fall. Second is uncontrolled sugar...",
