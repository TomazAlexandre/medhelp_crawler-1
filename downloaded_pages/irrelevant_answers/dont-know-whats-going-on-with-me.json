            "answer": "Hello,I don\u2019t think it is related to carpal tunnel syndrome.As you are having such symptoms on the whole right side,so it is definitely not physiological but pathological. As it is on right\u00a0\u00a0side of the body means that there may be an abnormality in the left side of the brain.It can be a neurological pathology like motor neuron disease,TIA or stroke or autoimmune condition like multiple sclerosis in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system (CNS), leading to demyelination.It can be diagnosed by MRI brain and MRS of the brain.Other possibilities are vit B12 deficiency,diabetes(already ruled out in your case) , hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism or peripheral nerve trauma or compression.If there are symptoms only on the right half of the body,it means a right side pathology of the brain.So I feel that clinical evaluation from a neurologist is necessary to rule it out.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
