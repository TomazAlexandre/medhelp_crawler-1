    "question": "I was recently at Biology lab and we were doing blood type testing. We were using lancets(like the ones in diabetes testing) to draw blood. Even though I was wearing gloves, during clean up I cut myself on one of the lancets, deep enough to draw blood. I know I am being paranoid, but is there a risk of contracting HIV if someone who was infected used the lancet. I know its remote, but it still worries me.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
