            "answer": "I was just diagnosed last week. I want given meds. I have to test my blood four times a day and stick to a diet of no sweets and limit carbs. The trick they told me\u00a0\u00a0is to make sure you balance out your carbs with protein. I check my vlood first thing in the morning and then eat breakfast. Two hours after that I have to check again and have a small snack. They want to keepy levels from going up and down. If after a certain amount of time my levels aren't good, then they will resort to meds. It was devastating to receive the news,\u00a0\u00a0but after meeting my doc, nutritionist and dietician I feel so much better.\u00a0\u00a0Try not to worry.\u00a0\u00a0If I can help you with anything else feel free to ask.",

            "answer": "I have gd not as bad as you so I don't have to be on medicine. I just have to watch what I eat and test my blood sugar 4 times a day. But I can tell you from having it for over a month and seeing what I can and cannot eat that it is not just because of sweets. Your sugar is quite high so you need to watch your carbs which turn into sugar everyone thinks it's just sugary things that are the problem its not.Bread, cereal(my major no no. This means any cereal even the healthy stuff), oatmeal, yogurt, beans, rice, pasta, Chinese food(big no no), tortillas, juice(big no no), bananas, milk, sweet sauces(BBQ sauce, terrayaki),potatoesAll these things except the no nos should be eaten in moderation you should almost cut them out completely but we do need carbs to have energy but they should be limited. You doctor should've given you a blood sugar meter you don't have to take the meds but please test your sugars and find what you can and cannot eat and how much.Also remember if you keep your blood sugar high when baby's umbilical corn is cut their sugar could drop and end up in nicu just just make sure you keep track and eat healthy.Good luck",

They checked my A1C and found I was high form the last three months.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't want to be high.\u00a0\u00a0I ate healthier and definitely watch my sugar.\u00a0\u00a0the urine collection test was done. My proteins were great.\u00a0\u00a0My kidneys functional.\u00a0\u00a0So then they had me do finger sticks for a week.\u00a0\u00a0My finger stick showed slight elevation in the mornings. Reading up on it.. the liver stores sugar from what you eat and releases it at night. I didn't need medication but I continue to watch what I eat. If sugar or high fructose corn syrup is one of the first three ingredients do NOT eat it!\u00a0\u00a0Reduce starchy foods and eat plenty of raw or fresh veggies and lean proteins!\u00a0\u00a0Goodluck!",

When little one is born I will have a high risk team in the delivery room with us to check on her. It's not just the sweets as ericatoday said. You have to watch your carbs. I'd take your meds until you know more info. I pray my numbers stay low enough that I don't need the meds,\u00a0\u00a0but if I have to take them for my little ones sake I will do anything and everything for her. Please seek out more info on this before you decide not to take them. There are so many risks that could happen if you ignore your meds.",

Your baby might not fit through the birth canal. If you have GD you baby could get low blood sugar leading to seizures. Also GD causes early/preterm birth. Not to mention your a candidate for preclampisa. I would pick yourself up a glucose monitor and take your blood 15mins after you wake up. Followed by 2hours after every meal. I am 19 weeks today. I have GD. I am on insulin at bedtime. I have changed my diet but even after the changes they decided on insulin. Like I said read up on what GD does to the baby before you decide not to take meds. If you don't like the one the doctor prescribed ask for an another.",
