            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you are having black outs in mornings only then it could be due to severe acidity, hypoglycemia or due to postural hypotension. This could also be due to exaggerated vaso vagal reflux on passing stool.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "You should see your doctor and get lab tests done. It could be a number of things....your thyroid, diabetes, etc. Or it could be something simple. I would have episodes where I couldn't stand up while doing my make-up in the morning. I would get light-headed, dizzy, and my heart would beat fast. What you could be experiencing is anxiety. It could possibly be that you need to eat first thing in the morning. But I def thin you should see a doc to rule everything out.",
