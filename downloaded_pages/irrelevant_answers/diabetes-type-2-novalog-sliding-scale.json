            "answer": "Hello,can you ask your doctor?Everyone is different in\u00a0\u00a0how much insulin they need so we can't advise you on this site.You could work it out, I guess. Test your blood sugar. Then inject one unit of insulin and test 2 hours later to see how far your blood sugar has fallen.\u00a0\u00a0One unit is not likely to cause any dramatic problem.\u00a0\u00a0Please make sure you monitor your blood sugar closely when you are taking insulin as an overdose can be dangerous and and an underdose won't get your sugars down enough.Do you have a past log book as recommended by diabetes86?How high is your sugar? If it is more than 200 you really should be contacting your doctor about this as well.",
