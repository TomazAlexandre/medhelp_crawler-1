            "answer": "Mary, Diabetes is connected to everything you describe having. Controlling sugar levels is step number one. Dizziness is associated with diabetes with sugar being either too high, but more likely too low. Since diabetes is a vascular illness...affecting the blood vessels through out your body...yes it will affect your eyes too. Control your sugar levels. Check your blood sugar levels and make sure you are using the right amount of insulin.Congrats on quitting smoking. Keep it up!Is weight an issue? Are you over weight? Small amounts of exercise helps everything you describe. Not trying out for the Olympics, just short walks that you can tolerate...even if it is just in the house..move a little. Always check your sugar.",

    "question": "I am only 51.yrs old, I Have diabetes 2 and on insulin. I have a lot of diagnosis but theres a few that I am most concerned about. I have fallen down 7 times in the past 7 months, I catch myself when walking suddenly up a against the wall like I lost my balance again and had the wall not been there I would have fallen. I get dizzy and I get chest pain all the time. Ekg's are abnormal with aschemia, 2 yrs ago I had chest pain that would not go away so I went to ER had an ekg there and failed it. I was there over night for a stress test, I failed in the first 5 minutes. they did an angiogram and said it was fine and further said it superseeds any failed stress test and ekg's. So no worries. I was 48 at that time. I had a CT scan to check for lung cancer, only cuz it was a free study for people with emphysema.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with COPD in 2009.\u00a0\u00a0I quit smoking finally on 3-12-2013. 5 more days and it will 1 month of no cigs, but I did switch to the E-Cig.\u00a0\u00a0The CT scan found right basilar scarring, bronchial inflammation, bronchiolitis, upper lung predomonant centrilobular emphysema, Coarse density in the inferior medial of the right lower lobe of prominent osteophte,\u00a0\u00a0a 7 mm nodule in my thyroid and aortic atherosclerosis.
