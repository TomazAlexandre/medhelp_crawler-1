            "answer": "I agree with Pam...everyone is so different. I was talking to a girl at work yesterday, and she said she gained 70 lbs with her daughter! She's a petite girl, though, and lost the weight within a few months after the birth. Me, on the other hand...I'm already overweight, and I went to the MD yesterday and I haven't gained one single pound. I'm 18 weeks. Gained four pounds with my son, and 12 pounds with my daughter. So...everyone is so different. If your doctor isn't concerned, then I'd take my lead from him. If you're healthy, I don't think the weight is an issue.Tricia",

            "answer": "What my dr. told me is that if you are \"normal\" weight prior to conceiving, you should gain 3 lbs. in the first 12 weeks, then a pound a week AVERAGE for each week after that.\u00a0\u00a0So, according to his info, you should have gained approx. 16 lbs (give or take) at this point.\u00a0\u00a0I am 23 weeks and my weight gain varies.\u00a0\u00a0I purposely gained 8 lbs. before getting pregnant and now at 23 weeks, I have gained an additional 14 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0Some weeks I gain 2 lbs and some weeks nothing.\u00a0\u00a0I think you are doing great!",

            "answer": "I am 25 weeks too and have gained about 12Kg which is around 25lbs. At first I lost 3-4kg (6-8lbs) of muscle during my morning sickness. So I went from 58kg to 54kg and now at 25 weeks I am 70kg. (1kg=2.2lbs)I have to get a test for Gestational Diabetes as my mom had it and is now Type 2 and I have an Aborginal background plus the U/S showed that I\u00a0\u00a0have \"extra\" amniotic fluid and my baby's stomach is slightly enlarged (both may be indicators for diabetes). I am 36y, 5'5 and not overweight and exercise regularily. I agree with the other \"posters\" that weight gain varies and one cannot really put a number on it.It is not good to lose weight during the third trimester so just eat right and exercise. At least that is what I have to do ;-)",

    "question": "Hello everyone,We had our 25 week appointment yesterday with the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I have gained 17 lbs. thus far into the pregnancy....they were really please with this and would like me to keep my total weight gain to below 30 lbs. (with my being high risk for pre-clampsia and gestational diabetes b/c of my being 39y/o).\u00a0\u00a0Has anybody else spoken with their docs in regards to how much weight they should gain?\u00a0\u00a0I told my family about the 17lbs. thus far and they seemed to think that was alot for being 25 weeks.... (I was normal weight when I got pregnant).",
