            "answer": "I am a type I diabetic and had my son last January. He is perfectly healthy. I kept my A1C between 5.4 and 5.9 for 6 months before and during my pregnancy. I also had to check blood sugars at least 8 times a day. I had a lot of tests done during my pregnancy to ensure that my baby was developing properly. It is a lot of work but well worth it. I would also recommend seeing an endocrinologist before thinking about getting pregnant and making sure you have a team of OB/GYN docs in your area that deal with high risk pregnancies especially pregnany women with type 1 diabetes.",
