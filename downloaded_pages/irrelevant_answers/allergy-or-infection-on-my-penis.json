            "answer": "Hi, your symptoms strongly suggest inflammation of the glans penis known as Balanitis and balanoposthitis. It needs to be differentiated from nummular eczema, Human papillomavirus infection and scabies. It is caused due to Candidal species, anaerobic infection or Aerobic infection.You need to undergo Serum or urine glucose testing to rule out diabetes, Gram stain and bacterial culture of discharge and Preputial swab for potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy. Once diagnosed can be treated with appropriate antibiotics. I suggest you to consult Dermatologist. Take care and regards.",
