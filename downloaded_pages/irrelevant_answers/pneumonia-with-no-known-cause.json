            "answer": "I went to see one of the pulmonary doctors who treated me and one (he treated me 3 years ago) told me I did not have pneumonia, but had ARDS. I do know what this is, but he also said this was a secondary condition to an infection somewhere. I also had a pancreatic attack he said and this was the second time this has happened.What kind of test is done to diagnose pancreatic disease??????? He said the doctors need to find out what is causing my white blood count to keep getting high--he did a test for leukemia and do not have that. I don't have a spleen anymore and I am 54 years old. Is pancreatic disease cureable????",

    "question": "I haven't been here in a while, but I need answers. My white blood count was 30,000 in April and was put in ICU and on a ventilator for almost two weeks. Every test imaginable was run, with no viral or bacterial infection. X-rays showed I had fluid in both lungs--almost died. Are there any other reasons for this to happen. Pulmonary doctor was also puzzled. I have researched everything about pneumonia and high white blood count, the only thing left is a test for leukemia. Please help.",
