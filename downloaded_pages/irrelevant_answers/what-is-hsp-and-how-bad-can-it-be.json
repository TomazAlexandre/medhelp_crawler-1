Although, these do not itch, can I expect the same thing from them.What is this and how on earth can I get rid of it?\u00a0\u00a0I've tried Benadryl, Hydrocortizone and Calamine Lotion.Help......Thanks",

    "question": "One day (Tuesday)I woke up with about 13 little itchy bumps on my right side of my trunk.\u00a0\u00a0They weren't very large, but by the next day they had accumulated to over 50 on one side and about 20 on the ohter, and also spreading some to my arm.\u00a0\u00a0That day I went to the doctor, and they said they weren't sure what it was, and put me on lotrimin (didn't help).\u00a0\u00a0That night they combined and soon my entire trunk was red with a darker red inside.\u00a0\u00a0It was extremely itchy and I went back in to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0He said he never seen something like that and put me on medidrol and some anti histamines.\u00a0\u00a0Neither of which worked to stop it from spreading or itching.\u00a0\u00a0By the weekend my entire trunk was extremely red, but my stomach was okay, and it stopped before getting to my back.\u00a0\u00a0Also my feet were a redish purple, and it was on my knees, and calves and in the inside of my elbows.\u00a0\u00a0There were no blistering, or cracking, and when you touched it the color stayed the same.\u00a0\u00a0Finally a doctor said I had a condition called HSP.\u00a0\u00a0I will be going to a specialist this week so he can take a sample of my skin and send it to Mayo.\u00a0\u00a0I was just wondering what this really is, and how does one get something like this.",
