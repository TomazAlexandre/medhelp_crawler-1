            "answer": "I was about your age (I was 16) when I went on insulin.\u00a0\u00a0I thought it was the scariest thing at first, but then you begin to get use to it because you keep telling yourself this is how it has to be for now on.\u00a0\u00a0My biggest advise to you, is educate all of your friends about what you have to do (blood sugar testing, taking insulin shots, etc.)...the more they know, the easier it will be for you to adjust as well.\u00a0\u00a0I would also consider using an insulin pump...it gives you a ton of flexibility that the shots don't.\u00a0\u00a0I have had Diabetes for 25 years, the last three or so I have been using a pump, and it was the best decision I ever made.As for the additional fluid that you say is in your legs, make sure you talk to your doctor about this, as it could possibly have something to do with your kidneys.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor may end up sending you to an endochrinologist - basically a doctor that specializes in Diabetes.Good Luck!Michael",
