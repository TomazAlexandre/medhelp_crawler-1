            "answer": "\"Is there anything I should be concerned with testing at 110?\"Plain and simple, you're pre-diabetic. If you don't start monitoring your diet by cutting back, way back, on your sugar intake (read all food labels), cut back on the bad carbs you will turn into a diabetic. It doesn't take much to get you over 126. Once a diabetic always a diabetic. Currently there is no cure, just control.A very good diabetes test is called an Hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c) test. This will measure the average glucose in your blood for the past 3 months. Normal reading is below 6%. A fasting glucose test only measure your glucose at that time, not over a period of time. The HgbA1c provides a better picture to your doctor.Here are your Diabetes symptoms, symptoms of type 2 Diabetes(hyperglycemia):* Increased thirst* Increased urination* Increased appetite* Fatigue* Blurred vision* Slow-healing infections* Impotence in menRegular exercise is especially important for people with diabetes and pre-diabetes. It helps with blood sugar control, weight loss, and high blood pressure. People who exercise regularly are less likely to experience a heart attack or stroke than diabetics who do not exercise regularly. Walking is good, not strolling lazily but nice brisk walk 3-5 times weekly will lower your glucose levels.Good luck and good health to you.",

Ive had my eyes checked by an Opthalmologist that said my eyes were in great health. He couldnt see the floaters in the test but theyre present in my vision.

They also drew more blood from my arm and I have yet to hear the results.",
