            "answer": "I would like to add to Anita's solid advice. Insulin does have its adverse reactions. Excess insulin may cause hypoglycemia and hypokalemia, particularly after IV administration. Hypoglycemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin relative to food intake. As with all medication, discuss in detail with your doctor the potential risks and advantages of the prescribe medication, including side effects. Talk with the pharmacist too.",
