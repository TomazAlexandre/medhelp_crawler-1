            "answer": "Hello,Thanks for posting your query.If you are able to orgasm during masturbation but are having problems ejaculating during intercourse (vaginal or oral) then the problem seems to be psychological in nature. Such a condition is called dry orgasm.You have not mentioned your age, but in young men, often the cause is psychological due to unrealistic sexual expectations which make sex a task rather than a pleasure and negative feelings about non performance.Other causes include obstruction of ejaculatory duct, seminal vesicle obstruction, retrograde ejaculation due to diabetes, damage or injury to the prostate such as due to prostate surgery and certain medications (like medications for high blood pressure, prostatic enlargement and mood disorders) ,surgical removal of the prostate or bladder, spinal cord injuries or radiation therapy for certain malignancies of the reproductive system.Get your blood sugar levels estimated. Also get an ultrasound penis and scrotum done. If you are taking any medications then discuss about those medications with your doctor.Also try changing the method of masturbation, by using lubricants (water based like KY jelly) or avoid masturbation for some days and then check whether you are able to ejaculate after intercourse.Hope that this information helps and hope that you will get better soon.Wishing you good health.",

    "question": "Hi there,I'll try and be as simple as possible:I can't ejaculate while having sexual intercourse with a woman (sensation just isn't there), blowjobs feel great but don't get me off and handjobs feel like nothing. I've grown up masturbating with my legs spread, muscles tightened and I usually do it dry, so I'm lead to believe that I've conditioned my penis into only ejaculating under these conditions, and so I can only ejaculate through self-stimulation.What can I do about this? Is it possible to reverse this conditioning?",
