    "question": "I am a 55 year old female diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 2000.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried different meds for this but have the chemical sensitivity that sometimes goes along with fibro.\u00a0\u00a0I currently am taking only Synthroid for hypothyroid and multivitamin, CoQ10, 5HTP, and niacin, and occasion Lorcet Plus for pain.\u00a0\u00a0Other than the fibro, I am in good health.\u00a0\u00a0No migraines, no high blood pressure, no diabetes, etc.My question is: I have had two very severe episodes of pain in past month (about 3 weeks apart)...one of which was so severe I couldn't get out of bed without assistance.\u00a0\u00a0Both only last a day or so...had tingly \"gone to sleep\" feeling in legs after each episode.\u00a0\u00a0My family doc decided to do an MRI after I told him about having MRI about 15 years ago which showed \"suspicious spots\" that neuro said were indicative of MS.\u00a0\u00a0Spinal fluid exam however did not.\u00a0\u00a0He (the neuro) told me that he couldn't say I didn't or wouldn't have it \"down the road\" b/c of these spots, but couldn't say I did right then b/c of the spinal fluid.Anyway, the latest MRI showed \"several areas of hyperintensity on T2 weighed images in the periventricular white matter and centrum semivale.\u00a0\u00a0These are bilateral and fairly symmetric.\u00a0\u00a0These are however nonspecific.\u00a0\u00a0This could be microvascular change from aretiosclerosis.\u00a0\u00a0They also have been described in patients with history of migraine headaches and vasculitits.\u00a0\u00a0Considering her age, I doubt demyelinating process such as MS.\u00a0\u00a0There are no highly specific lesions for this process. These do not enhance postcontrast.\"I have never had migraines or the vasculitis...so if the radiologist had know of previous MRI results(it was done at another hospital, so no comparison), do you think she would have come to same conclusion?\u00a0\u00a0And if this is negative, what type of doctor should I see for follow-up for the two episodes?Many thanks!",
