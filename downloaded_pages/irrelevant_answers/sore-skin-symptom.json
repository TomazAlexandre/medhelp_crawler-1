They might have SOME or NONE of the following symptoms:Frequent urinationExcessive thirstUnexplained weight lossExtreme hungerSudden vision changesTingling or numbness in hands or feetFeeling very tired much of the timeVery dry skinSores that are slow to healMore infections than usual.Nausea, vomiting, or stomach pains may accompany some of these symptoms in the abrupt onset of insulin-dependent diabetes, now called type 1 diabetes.Talk to your doctor about the symptoms you are experiencing if you have not done so already.\u00a0\u00a0(I am guessing you may have already done so considering you mentioned that there is not any damage - possibly get a 2nd opinion in regards to your symptoms)Take careSS",
