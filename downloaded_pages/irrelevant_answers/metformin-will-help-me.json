            "answer": "HI,With PCOS and hypothyroidism you need to continue with the treatment. This will result in normalizing of the hormonal milieu. However in order to conceive you will also require further treatment in the form of induction of ovulation and possibly IUI. Consult an infertility expert for an evaluation.Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Hi, I had problems getting pregnant, as well.\u00a0\u00a0I went on birth control pills when I was 16, because of menstrual pain and acne. I went off of it at age 20 to try and get pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0We tried for a year and then we stopped trying for 2 years and started trying again for the next 12 years until I was almost 35.\u00a0\u00a0I never got a single period on my own for this period of time.\u00a0\u00a0I had testing done when I was around 24 by a fertility doctor and was diagnosed with PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0I am an Ultrasound Technologist.\u00a0\u00a0I saw my ovaries on the ultrasounds and they were full of cysts.\u00a0\u00a0They looked\u00a0\u00a0like a cluster of grapes.\u00a0\u00a0I had to take Provera (progesterone) to bring on a period before taking the fertility drug, Clomid.\u00a0\u00a0I got pregnant 4 times.\u00a0\u00a0I was only able to carry them for exactly 3 months each.\u00a0\u00a0This is a problem with pregnant PCOS patients.\u00a0\u00a0I got very sick when I was 35 years old and my husband is older than me, so we decided to stop trying.\u00a0\u00a0Not being able to have a child was and still is devastating to me.I went to an endocrinologist at this time, who found that my insulin levels were very high.\u00a0\u00a0So, he put me on Metformin.\u00a0\u00a0At that time it was fairly new to do.\u00a0\u00a0After exactly 3 months, I had my very first period on my own since I was 16 years old.\u00a0\u00a0I ended up going back on the BCP shortly after that for the same reason as before.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on Metformin for 13 years now.\u00a0\u00a0I ended up in the hospital for something unrelated.\u00a0\u00a0When I was there the doctor scared me terribly.\u00a0\u00a0He told me that my sugar levels were not good and if I didn't start on a diabetic diet, I would definitely end up a diabetic in the next couple of years.\u00a0\u00a0All of my relatives on my dads side got diabetes in their 40's.\u00a0\u00a0My grandma went blind from it and my aunt died at 53 from heart complications due to her diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0She was not able to get pregnant either.\u00a0\u00a0Yikes!\u00a0\u00a0I started seeing a dietician right away.\u00a0\u00a0She explained to me that a low glycemic index (GI) diet is recommended for PCOS patients.\u00a0\u00a0I started with baby steps and within about 2 or 3 months I noticed a drastic change in my weight.\u00a0\u00a0I never tried to cut back on calories and never felt hungry.\u00a0\u00a0I always used to be hungry, especially for the high glycemic index foods like fat free potato chips, jelly beans, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Within one year, I weigh less than I ever did as an adult.Last month I had some routine blood tests, along with a full cholesterol panel, sugar and insulin.\u00a0\u00a0My cholesterol levels were always very abnormal, which is another problem in PCOS, even though for a lot of this time I was a vegetarian.\u00a0\u00a0Now the levels are normal, except my good cholesterol, HDL, is too low.\u00a0\u00a0The thing that shocks me the most is that my insulin levels are better than the average healthy person!\u00a0\u00a0My acne has gotten better too.\u00a0\u00a0It is amazing!\u00a0\u00a0(I haven't seen my ovaries to see if the cysts are gone, because I had to quit work due to other health issues and I am to sick to go for an ultrasound just to see.\u00a0\u00a0It wouldn't change anything now.)\u00a0\u00a0I believe that it is all chalked up to the low glycemic index diet and taking Metformin.\u00a0\u00a0Some doctors have been known to give patients Metformin in their 40's, when they have a strong family history of diabetes, just as a precaution.\u00a0\u00a0If I knew then, what I know now, I may have been able to get pregnant naturally and carried to full term!I strongly recommend you see a fertility specialist.\u00a0\u00a0If he/she advises that you take Metformin, I think it would be wise.\u00a0\u00a0As you have probably already gathered, I believe that a low GI diet would also help.\u00a0\u00a0Food is stronger than medicine!\u00a0\u00a0I have done a lot of searching for information about this.\u00a0\u00a0The following is an email with information about this that I sent to my sister:Here are some sites for glycemic index and glycemic load, which have information about glycemic index and glycemic load\u00a0\u00a0and lists of food. \u00a0You won't see protein, fat, or very low carbohydrate foods on the list of foods for glycemic index or glycemic load. \u00a0Only carbohydrate foods have a glycemic index and therefore glycemic load , so the other foods you can automatically eat without worrying about them raising your blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0You don't have to cut calories with this type of a lifestyle change, but should eat the number of calories for your ideal weight. Obviously, you should try to keep your saturated fat down to a minimum and never have transfats as they are very unhealthy.\u00a0\u00a0Look on the labels to see what is in the food, like carbohydrate, fat;saturated and transfats, protein, and more.\u00a0\u00a0 Try to eat salmon, halibut and other cold water fish to get healthy omega 3 essential fatty acids into your body at least 2 or 3 times/week. \u00a0When you eat carbohydrate foods with fat and protein, it slows down the blood sugar response.\u00a0\u00a0So it is better to eat your fruit after your meal not by itself, for example. \u00a0Also, foods that have vinegar in them, like pickles slow down the sugar from entering your blood stream.\u00a0\u00a0Cinnamon does this too.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise also helps your body keep your blood sugar more level, too.http://www.mendosa.com/gilists.htmhttp://www.ajcn.org/content/76/1/5.full.pdfhttp://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/early/2008/10/03/dc08-1239.full.pdfhttp://www.montignac.com/en/search-for-a-specific-glycemic-index/http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods.htmhttp://www.ajcn.org/content/62/4/869S.full.pdfhttp://www.robburkefitness.com/site/linked_docs/Revised%20International%20Table%20of%20Glycemic%20Index.pdfI keep these links on my home page (desk top) for easy access.There are several books out their too. \u00a0I am reading two; \u00a0Low GI Guide To Living Well With PCOS & The Glycemic Index Diet For Dummies.Managpal, I know what you are going through, as far as the social stigmatism.\u00a0\u00a0At first, I didn't want to tell anybody what my husband and I were going through.\u00a0\u00a0After a few years, it took it's toll for both my husband and I.\u00a0\u00a0I think he took this all much harder than me.\u00a0\u00a0He hated to see what I was going through medically and felt helpless.\u00a0\u00a0We started talking with people who were close to us.\u00a0\u00a0Even though it didn't fix anything, it was very helpful to have the support from our loved ones.\u00a0\u00a0Please, I hope you can learn from my experience.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you all the best and a little bouncing baby to love real soon!",

            "answer": "I also have PCOS. I wasn't getting my period when I tried to get pregnant. so I went to a fertilty specialest. They put me on birth control to try to trick my body into ovulation, also tried clomid..didn't do a thing. BUT we tried fermera, which is a new drug usually used to treat breast cancer.. It worked right away, I took a trigger shot to drop my egg and boom I was pregnant and welcomed my son 4-5-11. I know it is hard to be patient..Because I was not. But try to be, stress can also cause it harder to get pregnant. If you have any questions just ask.",
