    "question": "I am a 33 year old male recently had unprotected sex with a female 10 days ago.\u00a0\u00a0I became very worried about STD's and got tested last week with a urine and visual check.\u00a0\u00a0I told the Dr I did notice small amounts of clear fluid when I would \"milk\" my urethra before urinating in the morning and sometimes if I became aroused during the day.\u00a0\u00a0There was no discharge in the office and the initial urine test came back with no inflamatory reading.\u00a0\u00a0I again noticed occasional clear discharge so I went back first thing in the AM with no morning urination and was able to \"milk\" some clear fluid from my urethra and the culture came back with a \"rare\" white blood cell count and again the urine test was neg.\u00a0\u00a0I have no pain and the disharge is not noticable unless I bring it to the surface and it is not always persistant. Occasionaly I see stain on my boxers and am not sure if I have always had this or am just paranoid.I am also a type-1 diabetic so can that explain the \"rare\" with blood cell count?\u00a0\u00a0If not is it NGU or just me aggrevaiting my urethra?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
