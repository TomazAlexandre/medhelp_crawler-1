            "answer": "Hello,Numbness and tingling are abnormal sensations that can occur anywhere in your body, but are often felt in your hands, feet, arms, or legs.They are called are called Paresthesia.Many causes of numbness are there. These include injury to the back or spinal cord, lack of blood supply to the limbs as a result of plaque formation in the blood vessels, diabetes, stroke, motor neurone disease, multiple sclerosis and underactive thyroid. Abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body and a lack of vitamin B12 can also cause numbness in the arms and legs.You can take multivitamins for some time. Also get your blood sugar and thyroid levels tested.You may need CT or MRI brain to rule out any neurological causes.My opinion is to get yourself examined by a neurologist. After confirmatory diagnosis only, treatment can be started.Pls keep us posted if you need any more information.",
