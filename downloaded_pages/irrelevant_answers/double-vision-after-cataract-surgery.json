    "question": "My husband had cataract surgery two months (left eye) and one month (right eye) ago.\u00a0\u00a0His left eye has a lens that allows him to see close up, and his right eye has a lens that allows him to see at a distance.\u00a0\u00a0He was having no trouble at all with this arrangement for the first 30 days after the second surgery.One week ago, he suddenly developed double vision, which has gotten slightly worse since he fist noticed it.\u00a0\u00a0His eyes are clearly not tracking quite the same.\u00a0\u00a0His opthamologist thinks this is a microvascular nerve palsy which will resolve over time.\u00a0\u00a0However, he has no diabetes or hypertension or other risk factors.\u00a0\u00a0He is 68 years old.Questions:1)\u00a0\u00a0Can this have been caused by the cataract surgery?\u00a0\u00a0It is strange to be 30 days post-op (rather than immediately afterwards) but also strange in that he has never had such a problem prior to the surgery.2)\u00a0\u00a0How long is improvement likely to take?\u00a0\u00a0Will it be gradual?\u00a0\u00a0We are quite worried about this, especially because the condition seems to be getting worse, not better.",
