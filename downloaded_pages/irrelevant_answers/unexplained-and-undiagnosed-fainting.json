    "question": "I am 17 years old and have for the past few years experienced sporadic and unexplained loss of consciousness. The doctors have hypothesized extensively about what my condition could be, but all their theories so far have been discredited. Hypoglycemia, Diabetes, heart and cardiovascular problems, all have been tested and I don't have any of them. I went to Vanderbuilt to a specialist in the hopes of finally putting to rest this dilemma, but the doctors there were puzzled as well as to why all their tests were coming back without any disturbances. I've had multiple episodes over the years, varying in situations leading up to the episodes, and the doctors are no longer of any help. I've resorted to researching on my own over the internet and through medical databases. However, I no longer know where to turn. I don't want this condition ruling over my life. I'm extremely athletic and wish to not be restricted because of the fear of losing consciousness. I'm even more concerned seeing as my college education will start this fall, and so I want to leave my familiar environment of home in full confidence and without having to worry about when I'm going to pass out next.",
