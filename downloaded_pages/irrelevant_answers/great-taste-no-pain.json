            "answer": "I am a firm believer in how our diets make us feel.\u00a0\u00a0Anytime a doctor gives you a diagnosis that includes the word \"Syndrome\" at the end just means they do not know what is wrong with you.Over the years food manufactures have genetically changed almost ALL the food we eat.\u00a0\u00a0From pork, poultry, milk, wheat and fruit...all of it has some kind of addiditive, preservative, pesticide, hormone or herbicide in it or on it.\u00a0\u00a0Our bodies do not know what to do with these chemicals which causing all kinds of medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0Autism, ADD, ADHD, diabetes, cancer...all are linked to our food supply.Do a search on gluten intollerance, intestinal candida overgrowth or you may even be lactose intollerant...all 3 go hand in hand.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps.",
