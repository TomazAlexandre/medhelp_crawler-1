    "question": "I have been diagnosed with extremely high iron levels and have been tested for hemochromatosis which was negative but now my sugar levels are high along with my choleterol. I have previously had heart problems and this weekend I have developed pain in my upper right quadrant just under my ribs and when i bend over it is like something is in the way.I have had my gall bladder removed years ago.Could all the above symptons be related? What is causing the new pain?",
