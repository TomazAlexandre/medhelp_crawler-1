            "answer": "I read your other post and will reply to both here. First, try not to type in all CAPS. On the Internet it is akin to shouting we can hear you fine in lower case letters. :)An A1c of 5.5% equals a daily glucose of 118mg/dl, or equal to prediabetes. At 126mg/dl you would be considered diabetic. At this stage of the game you have good chance of reversing your prediabetic condition without the use of medication [Metformin]. You do this by maintaining proper weight, exercising, and abstaining from sugary foods and liquids. Besides watching sugar in your diet-- you also need to watch carbohydrates [starches] carefully too. For example; things like white breads, potatoes, pasta, crackers, foods made with white flour, etc. can cause a drastic rise in your blood sugar if you aren't careful. [They are converted to sugar after you eat them]. Lower your intake of man-made or prepared foods too. All the above will lower your blood glucose levels but you must do all - slacking on one defeats the others.I would not go back to this pill dispensing doctor. You're not a stage where you need drugs, you're very close but not there yet. By doing the aforementioned you have a very good chance of returning your blood glucose to normal levels, but only if you adhere to a healthy lifestyle.Lastly, go to your local drug store and buy a home glucose meter, read the instructions carefully and test, test, test. Test first thing in morning b4 you eat then 2-3 hours after. Do this with every meal [b4 and after] to see how the foods you consumed affect your blood glucose levels. Avoid those that do. Read the other posts on this forum and Google search diabetes related information to educate yourself.Glucose test level goals:Prandial [b4 eating] normal is 70-99 mg/dlPostprandial [after eating 2-3 hours] <141 mg/dl, optimum <121 mg/dl",

            "answer": "OK, hopefully this is clearer; your current levels are at a point where lifestyle changes [1st post, 2nd paragraph] will make a difference in reversing your condition. Metformin will not reverse nor prevent diabetes, it 'helps' to control the amount of glucose in your blood. By ignoring those lifestyle changes your condition will progress into diabetes. At this day and age there is no cure for diabetes.If you have an Endocrinologist [a doctor who specializes in diabetes] or a diabetes nurse, or a diabetes nutritionist they can help you a lot with nutritional guidelines. [Serving sizes, and how many servings of each type food that's safe for you.]",

            "answer": "I just read your bio about your Pituitary gland tumor. I am sorry to see that and hoping it gets dissolved soon. The Thyroid is under control of the Pituitary. When the Thyroid gets disrupted it disrupts Pancreas insulin production which in turn can cause high blood glucose levels.Since both the Pituitary and Thryroid are endocrine glands perhaps a visit to an Endocrinologist is in order for a professional medical second opinion above and beyond any non-medical one found on health forums. Good luck to you.",
