            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Extreme fatigue could be due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems. Another possibility is sleep disturbances (like sleep apnea, imbalance of rapid eye and non rapid eye movement sleep etc.). You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, low Vit b12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium. Hyperthyroidism too causes increased sweating and tiredness.\u00a0\u00a0 A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Diabetes too is a possibility.\u00a0\u00a0Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

            "answer": "Doctornee has outlined all the possibilities nicely.Anemia is the moist common cause. This can be due to an inadequate supply of oxygen carrying blood cells or iron deficiency.The second step on the yellow brick road should be towards the office of an endochronologist. An endochrine screen will rule out the possibility of a thyroid or metabolic disorder.A glucose utilization problem may be the cause, secondary to diabetes, but this problem is usually related to eating and one generally is not consistently tired.As doctornee suggested, you require an in-person evaluation. There are other possibilities. This is a not a \"general quarters\" emergency, but make an appointment today. Request a copy of your lab results.\u00a0\u00a0The chances are you have a problem that can be solved. Don't give up until you find an answer, and when you do, post the results here.",
