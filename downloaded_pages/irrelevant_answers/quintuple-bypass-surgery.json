    "question": "Hello, my family member recently had a quintuple bypass surgery about 12 days ago. the hospital released him about 3 or 4 days after surgery. he is now home, he is 58 and he says that he has been feeling very tired. he sleeps for a couple hours and then wakes up and walks around a little bit. i was wondering if it is normal for him to be feeling really tired, he sleeps but when he wakes up hes still tired. could this be because hes not eating enough or, exerting himself too much. thank you for listening and plz help me.",
