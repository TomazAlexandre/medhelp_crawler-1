            "answer": "Hi!Many women go through this phase post motherhood. Please join a support group or a friend circle that is enthusiastic about losing weight so that you remain motivated. If your weight and figure make you worry too much then join a counselor who can help you stay motivated and reduce your anxiety.Then consult a nutrition expert and a physical trainer. You can also join an online app for weight loss and food tracking. This will also help you keep a tab on the calories you consume.Please consult your doctor to find if you have any hormonal problem or diabetes or a thyroid problem that is causing the increased weight. If yes, then treating this cause will also help reduce weight. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
