            "answer": "Hi,I switched from Humalog to Novolog in my pump a coupla years ago and am *delighted* with the results.\u00a0\u00a0Novolog seems to be more predictable and is more stable for the 3-4 days it's in my pump.Can you work with your doctor to try a different pen?The novolog pen holds 300 units, right?\u00a0\u00a0I tried a Novolog Jr pen a while back (thinking I might like it instead of syringes for my low-tech backup) which holds fewer units and allows 1/2 unit increments.My pump also holds 300 units and because I use <24 units a day, I figured out that the insulin in the \"second half\" of each 300 unit cartridge had gotten shaken up, exposed to temp variations, and other potency-degrading \"insults\" - and my BGs tended to be\u00a0\u00a0higher during that second 1/2.\u00a0\u00a0If the cartridges are plastic, this process is even more likely to occur since I'm told insulin molecules \"stick\" to plastic more than glass & can begin to interfere with delivery also.If, as a type 1, your total daily dosage (TDD) is modest then do talk to your endo about using a smaller cartridge/pen.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a physician, but a long-time DMer who has listened to & read a lot from others.\u00a0\u00a0As was already pointed out, it's more common to hear from folks who go from Humalog to Novolog than the other way.Hope the comments keep coming & that it's helpful for you.",

            "answer": "I find your complaint is surprising. I have just switched from Humalog to Novolog. The main reason was so that I could use the Innovo pen, which works very well. The Novopen is also of of a higher quality than the Humalog pens.The other advantage of Novolog is that it starts working more quickly. I don't get the same post-meal spikes that I used to get with Humalog.Maybe you just need a new pen. You should be able to get one free from your CDE. I replace my pens every year as a matter of course.Cheers,Mark",

Sometimes, the pen does not dispense at all, seems to function fine till I have to flush out 6-10 units of insulin at a time to make it work again. I have had severe highs with this - when I thought I injected myself with insulin and the pen did not function like it should.",

To me it looks like a flaw in the design as I have never felt excess insulen dripping out. I have sent complaints and you should to. I have one sitting by me right now that has no needle and it moved. I think the problem is you cant carry them with you. I think movement is causing the issue.",
