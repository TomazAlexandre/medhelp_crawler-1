            "answer": "Well, you did the right thing in going to the ER! Sounds like they did a great job. This is a question for your physician and specifically the one who signed the report. Make an appointment and ask them. They won't bite. Sounds like you have some damage or partially blocked blood vessels. Basically plumbing problems. You have a warning and need to take heed to insure adequate diet, nutrition and exercise.",

            "answer": "The ER doctor actually said there is nothing wrong, you just have a headache. They called the next morning and said the radiologist reviewed the scan and called in antibiotics for a sinus infection. The radiology report itself reads \" Frontal sinus opacification with overlying calvarial soft tissue swelling. There is questionable extension of soft tissue from the left frontal sinus into the superior orbital space, although this could just be secondary to volume averaging. No definite bony destruction to suggest osteomyelitis.\"\u00a0\u00a0Not sure what this means??? BUT...the paper the doctor wrote his report on under Laboratory it says \"The CT scan showed some microvasccular disease but no signs of hemorrhage or mass effect.\" Like I said nobody mentioned anything like that. Blood pressure checked at 114/70 and 106/60 the 2 times they checked it. My family doc is on vacation and this is driving me nuts!! Thanks for your help!",

            "answer": "Microvascular disease of the brain shows up as tiny white spots on the scan.\u00a0\u00a0This is usually just a sign of aging.\u00a0\u00a0It is why I can't remember someone's name or forgot why I went into the other room. :-(\u00a0\u00a0 It progresses faster in people with certain diseases like Alzheimer's or uncontrolled hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0If you are concerned, you could ask to be re-scanned a year from now and see if it gets any worse.\u00a0\u00a0Unless you are a youngster, it's probably nothing to worry about.\u00a0\u00a0Most of us middle aged and older have some microvascular disease and don't know it unless we have our heads scanned.",

    "question": "Went to the ER with a severe headache which was diagnosed with a CT scan as a sinus infection. Today I got a copy of my records and along with the sinus info it also says \" shows some microvascular disease\". Nobody ever mentioned anything like that to me.......what does it mean?",
