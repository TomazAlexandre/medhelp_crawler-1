            "answer": "With you being this close to the surgery I would just skip it. If you are craving maybe try sparkling water with a little of your favorite juice to cut down on the sugar. I have two kids with major complications from gestational diabetes. Trust me it's just better to do without the sugar as much as possible for the duration",

            "answer": "If you just had just eaten, the results makes sense, so I'm not sure where the concern lies.\u00a0\u00a0You have very little time left, so do your best to eat well, get plenty of fluids (to keep Braxton-Hicks in check) and get plenty of protein and \"green leafys\" in your diet.\u00a0\u00a0Less sugar is always good, but I don't think a soda here and there will hurt anything, especially if your pregnancy has been going smoothly otherwise.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

    "question": "At my last appointment my doctor asked what I had eaten because I had sugar in my urine. I had actually JUST eaten and had pop to drink. I dont normally ever do caffeine but the place I ate had Barqs instead of mugs rootbeer. Not that caffeine is a factor, but I mentioned it to her. And I haven't had an appointment where I have eaten before usually always eat after I leave visit.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway she said no more rootbeer until after baby. (I'm 38 weeks today with scheduled c section for April 23)My question is, how big of a deal is this? I still have sprite now and then and have been eating sugar.Should I not? I won't see her again, this tues is pre-op then next Tues is BABY!!!!THANKS in advance for any advice.",
