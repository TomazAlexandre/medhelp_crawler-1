            "answer": "Hello,I can understand your concern about developing diabetes because it's in your family now.\u00a0\u00a0While I'm not a physician, it seems to me that you have good reason to relax a bit, while you stay alert to possible symptoms.Here's what I mean.\u00a0\u00a0I used a website to compute your BMI (Body Mass Index) that's commonly used to assess whether one is underweight, normal, or overweight.\u00a0\u00a0Based on your height, you are of normal weight.\u00a0\u00a0The site I used is this one:http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/calc-bmi.htm#MetricBe sure to convert your height into meters (1.77)On to your blood sugar numbers.\u00a0\u00a0Depending on the time of day you have done your random testing, a completely normal non-diabetic may well see numbers above 100.I like to use a resource from the American Diabetes Association (ADA), which is primarily focused on education and has lots of info about pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I believe they have affiliates worldwide, so there may be offices near you, too.According to their website, a FASTING (first thing in the morning - no food/beverage after midnight; testing 6-8 hours later), <100 is a normal reading; 100-126 can indicate pre-diabetes; and >126 indicates diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The website I used is:http://www.diabetes.org/pre-diabetes/pre-diabetes-symptoms.jspOn the ADA website, you'll have access to much information about symptoms, how to prevent pre-diabetes and diabetes, and general advice that seems good for everyone even without diabetes.Finally, you mentioned that you don't exercise regularly.\u00a0\u00a0I can relate to that and am in the same boat.\u00a0\u00a0I do KNOW both from my reading and my personal experience, that during periods when I am exercising rather regularly it is better for my overall health:\u00a0\u00a0blood pressure, diabetes, complexion, oral health, and even my disposition.\u00a0\u00a0Somehow, I allow myself to go thru months where I simply don't exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Your msg (and my writing to you) is another gentle reminder to get back into a good routine!I hope this helps you -- do check back to read others' responses and to share your progress.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your reply.\u00a0\u00a0The sites you pointed out gave me a lot of information. A few points I can mention here afer reading your reply are below:1.

            "answer": "Sanalseema,Thnk you for writing to the JDRF Medhelp Forum.\u00a0\u00a0I am a volunteer and not a physician and therfore am not qualified to diagnose Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 I do know that Diabetes is a complicated disease and ther are different types of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Eating sugar does not cause Diabetes in and of itself.\u00a0\u00a0Your body may have a diminished capacity to produce insulin or to use it effectively which may be the cause of your slightly elevated blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0This may be something that can be helped by reducing your weight or your sugar intake, or by taking medication.\u00a0\u00a0A physician would really need to evalute your individual situation.\u00a0\u00a0I would encourage you to see an endocrinolist or a physician knowledgeable about Type I and Type II diabetes for some medical guidance.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.ES",
