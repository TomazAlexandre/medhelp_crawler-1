I had a c - section like surgery when I had an ectopic and I was out of commission for a week and a half. I'd rather do vaginal.\u00a0\u00a0I hear people talk about infections with c - sections too",

So when I had my two girls the said ceaser was the best option for me, and I loved them! Much easier to recover from thats for sure:) everyone is different though and not one delivery is the same.",

            "answer": "My csection was Not what I wanted & I did not have a choice. My recovery was terrible and I will never choose to have another one!!! I am lucky and my doctor and hospital will support a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC), but not all women are that lucky!\u00a0\u00a0Many doctors will make you have another csection after you've already had one. No other option for them. Csections are more expensive, so I hope you have good insurance. Or you'll be paying more out of your own pocket. Also, VBACs are also more expensive than vaginal, but cheaper than csection. I had serious problems with my milk supply and my daughter's pediatrician & also my new OBGYN believe that it is due to the fact that I never went into labor at all. Formula cost us around $80 a month when it is practically free to breastfeed (not to mention, healthier for baby & promotes weight loss for mom.) If it wasn't for the fact that my daughter and I could have both died if I went into labor, I would have absolutely not had a cesarean!!",

Oh and my mum smoked when she had me too. As I dont smoke or drink, and I can feel the diabetes already-booked for test no two this week-i've got no way to keep the weight down except exercise.\u00a0\u00a0And I'm lucky if I'm out of bed for 3 hours a day from the fatigue atm so thats out too. Also, I'm a carbon copy of my mum, and she's had to endure 4 repairs on both a and v from me. I know it may have breastfeeding and bonding ramifications but I'd rather spend the money on formula now, and not have to spend $10k for each repair for the next 30 years.",
