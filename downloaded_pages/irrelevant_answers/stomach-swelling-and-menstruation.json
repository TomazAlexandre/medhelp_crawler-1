            "answer": "Hi,Are you a fairly new menstruator? (Is that a word?) You don't say how old you are. Periods can hit hard in the early months or years. I have two teenager daughters, and the older diabetic one has less of a hard time than her younger non-diabetic sister, who actually passed out and cut open her head while in the midst of a bad period.I haven't heard of diabetes having an impact on menstruation? Has anyone else?",

            "answer": "I am 19 years of age and this type of menstruation cycle has never happend to me before.Actually earlier this year it has been bad to the point that I could not sleep at night because of the pain. Is your daughter doing better? My guess is it has to do with insulin shots especially when injected through the stomach.",

            "answer": "I am an insulin-dependent female and I have never had any problems like this. Yuo might want to take note of whether this happens again or how often and then perhaps go to see your OB-GYN doctor and make sure that you don't have any fibroid tumors that could be\u00a0\u00a0starting if you continue to have problems. I do not believe that this is likely to be connected to diabetes.",
