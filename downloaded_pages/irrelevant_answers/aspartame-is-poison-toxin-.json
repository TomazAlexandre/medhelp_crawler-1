            "answer": "Sumeet,It looks like you came across one of the \"anti-Aspartame\" sites.\u00a0\u00a0There are plenty of anti \"this & that\" sites, and there are just as many sites touting the benefits of \"snake oil\" (useless expensive -- and sometimes dangerous! products that only make their vendors a lot of money).\u00a0\u00a0It can be hard to figure out if we're getting reliable info or just a snake-oil sales pitch.Some folks (phenylketonurics) cannot tolerate any aspartame at all.\u00a0\u00a0You would know if you have this condition.\u00a0\u00a0Other folks dislike the whole idea of artificially created sweeteners and others just don't like their taste.\u00a0\u00a0Some of us incorporate them into our regular diet and are grateful for expanded food choices it provides.At your next doctor's visit, I recommend you chat with him/her about your usage and pay attention to whether you have any noticeable effects from foods/beverages with aspartame.\u00a0\u00a0The choice to use (or not) certain foods in our diets is a very personal one and there are passionate views on many approaches.\u00a0\u00a0Seems to me that we do well when we discuss these things with our endocrinologists and/or certified diabetes educator.As you know, I'm neither ;-) but wanted to add my views here.",

And just count Carbs.\u00a0\u00a0This helps our daughter feel like a regular kid.Thanks for the info on the website.\u00a0\u00a0Please feel free to stop back and visit our site again.",

            "answer": "I think this is a VERY serious, unrecognized issue that people are continuously ignoring. My grandmother is a brittle diabetic and frequently drinks lots of Diet Coke. More recently she has been experiencing extreme chills on a daily basis - for which all medical professionals that she has visited can come up with no diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Due to this, and in conjunction with \"rumors\" of the deadly sugar-substitute aspertame, I have recently been researching the effects of aspartame - via diet sodas -\u00a0\u00a0on the body. My findings have been appalling, to say the least. Aside from those who suffer from diabetes, aspartame (included in diet sodas and many other foods and products. ex. Winterfresh gum, light yogurt & Flintstones Vitamins) is an extremely harmful - and deadly - additive.The effects of aspartame include and are not limited to:(list from www.dorway.com)Abdominal PainAnxiety attacksarthritisasthmaAsthmatic ReactionsBloating, Edema (Fluid Retention)Blood Sugar Control Problems (Hypoglycemia or Hyperglycemia)Brain Cancer (Pre-approval studies in animals)Breathing difficultiesburning eyes or throatBurning UrinationChest Painschronic coughChronic FatigueConfusionDeathDepressionDiarrheaDizzinessExcessive Thirst or Hungerfatigueflushing of faceHair Loss (Baldness) or Thinning of HairHeadaches/Migraines dizzinessHearing LossHeart palpitationsHives (Urticaria)Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)Impotency and Sexual Problemsinability to concentrateInfection SusceptibilityInsomniaIrritabilityItchingJoint PainslaryngitisMarked Personality ChangesMemory lossMenstrual Problems or ChangesMigraines and Severe Headaches (Trigger or Cause From Chronic Intake)Muscle spasmsNausea or VomitingNumbness or Tingling of ExtremitiesOther Allergic-Like ReactionsPanic AttacksPhobiaspoor memoryRapid Heart BeatRashesSeizures and ConvulsionsSlurring of SpeechSwallowing PainTachycardiaTremorsTinnitusVertigoVision LossWeight gainAspartame Disease Mimics Symptoms or Worsens the Following DiseasesFibromyalgiaArthritisMultiple Sclerosis (MS)Parkinson's DiseaseLupusMultiple Chemical Sensitivities (MCS)Diabetes and Diabetic ComplicationsEpilepsyAlzheimer's DiseaseBirth DefectsChronic Fatigue SyndromeLymphomaLyme DiseaseAttention Deficit Disorder (ADD)Panic DisorderDepression and other Psychological DisordersThat is just to list some of the known reactions to this poison, however comas and death have also been documented.\u00a0\u00a0The main reason for these reactions is that aspartame (aspartylphenylalanine-methyl-ester) breaks down into poison (aspartic acid 40%, phenylanine 50%, and methanol 10%) when exposed to temperatures of 86+ degrees. ***Remember: normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees, which includes the temperature of your stomach where the soda sits!***\u00a0\u00a0Ultimately the underlying condition which people become inflicted with is methanol poisoning.\u00a0\u00a0All that being said, I would encourage you to explore the over-whelming amount of evidence and personal stories that are out there for yourself, as I have.\u00a0\u00a0One night of research on this subject has turned me into an anti-aspartame-activist, so to speak. There are many sites out there which address the issues I mentioned, as well as other pertinent issues, in depth, and give explainations as to how continued distribution has been allowed. A very good page that I have found which briefly explains and concludes these problems, and those facing diabetics in particular, in a clear manner is found at (copy & paste into your browser address bar):http://www.bibleplus.com/health/ms_lupus.htmand another very informative site whose webmaster has lost several family members to methanol poisoning:http://www.aspartamekills.com/symptoms.htmSo, again, I very strongly urge you to research this issue yourself, alert others of this growing problem, and avoid all products that include aspartame in them.\u00a0\u00a0If nothing else, drinking some water with a lemon (or other citrus/fruit slice in it for flavor) has countless mental and physical benefits over consuming a diet - or even non-diet - soda anyday.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for reading this post (despite its length and I hope it can help you or someone you know in some way. Good luck!~Amber",

Obviously, this can be difficult and I personally recommend that everyone try to confirm information with additional sites that you are confident in.Please keep in touch. I do agree that there is alot of debate regarding this. Some have no problems with some and then do with others. I know of many that experience no problems at all.Thank You,dm",
