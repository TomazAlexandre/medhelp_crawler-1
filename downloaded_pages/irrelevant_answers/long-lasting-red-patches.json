            "answer": "Hi,It is hard to tell at this point what exactly causes these red patches that seem to resolve spontaneously and appear sporadically. A few differentials may be considered : nummular dermatitis, allergic or contact dermatitis, fungal infections, pityriasis rosea, psoriasi , a variant of SLE, and syphilis.I know your condition worries you however, what I have posted are only differentials that you may read on and discuss with your dermatologist. I suggest you\u00a0\u00a0consult with an internist\u00a0\u00a0who may be able to request for further tests to exclude other underlying conditions.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the reply.Here's what I have discounted (based on my 0 years of medical training!)1.Pityriasis Rosea - I have already had this 2 years ago. My current condition(s) seems very different to that.2. Syphilis - Numerous negative tests, plus took enough enough Doxy over long enough periods a couple of years ago to kill off pretty much anything it is effective upon!3. Psoriasis - no itching or scalingAlso, contact dermatitis - I was under the impression this resolved quite quickly, whereas this is long lasting. Also, there is no itching or scaling.Thanks for the feedback. I am going to my GP next week, but here in the UK we get the usual \"come back in a month\" responses so I don't hold out much hope on getting a referral!",

    "question": "Okay, so over the last year I've had some bizarre skin problems. I'll list them here:1. Red patches on soles of feet (one on each - much lesser on my left foot, however) that lasted for a few months and then disappeared. There may have been a mild itch and the skin seemed a bit thinner. Did not respond to creams (E45 or HC). Looked much like Tinea Nigra (except was pink, not dark, and very much: like this pic http://dermnetnz.org/fungal/tinea-nigra.html). The patch on my left foot tried to come back, but gave up and quickly disappeared. However! I live in a city in England and have not been to any tropical places.2. I have been getting relatively small pink patches on my trunk, one or two at a time. One will last for a month or two and disappear before another one comes up in a different place. One rather large patch appeared on the side of my chest, disappeared and then reappeared later, albeit a slightly smaller size.\u00a0\u00a0They do not itch, but occassionally do look slightly raised. No scaling. I cannot really find anything on the net that seems similar, except maybe a small case of parapsoriasis, which is uncommon.I had eczema as a kid which has also slightly returned recently, but the problems above are different and do not follow any ezcema patterns. I have been worried about HIV / Syph but have tested negative numerous times outside any window periods.Anyone got any ideas, or had any similar problems? It all seems a little weird to me...Thanks!",
