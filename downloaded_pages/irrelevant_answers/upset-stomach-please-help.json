            "answer": "Hi, metabolic disorders like Diabetes Mellitus and Hypothyroidism could cause the symptoms described by you. A simple blood test could help detect diabetes and hypothyroidism. Consult your primary care physician for these tests. It could also be due to malabsorption, inflammatory bowel diseases and various infections of the colon. If these causes are ruled out then IBS could be causing your symptoms. Regards.",

    "question": "Hi there,I am not sure if any of you can help me but here goes:I have been suffering from dull aches in my stomach for over a year now. They go away when i am eating and i am alright for at least an hour after every meal.I also get these other symptoms, most of them occur together and with no warning and clear with rest:Flatulence (really bad)ConstipationHigh head temperature (though feel cold)DizzinessNausea (no vomiting)HeartburnExtreme Fatigue (I fall asleep randomly at night if not keeping active)At times i feel like i need to stretch my stomach out and others like i need to curl up and compress it.I also get extreme shakes which i cannot control when i start to get a temperature.I can't even walk to the shop which is 5 minutes from my house without feeling dizzy and really tired and weak.My chest starts to feel constricted which makes it difficult to breathe occasionallyI have been for an endoscopy (clear) tested for H.Pyori (clear) Bloods (clear) Tested for Celiac Disease (Clear)I am really worried about this now, I have lived of nothing but soup and stir fry's (using only chicken or turkey) However this did not help alleviate the symtoms so have gone back to eating normally for the past few weeks and still feel the exact same way.My doctor seems somewhat uninterested now as if he thinks i am making this up. However despite my Eczema i have never been near a doctor for anything else. I was put on Omeprazole which i took everyday for 7 months, without any improvement, so my doctor suggested i stopped taking them. I now am not on any meds apart from the occasional antacid when the heartburn gets too bad.Does anyone have any suggestions as to what it could be? I am back at the Gastroenterologist in 3 weeks so hopefully he will think of something we could try.Thank you",
