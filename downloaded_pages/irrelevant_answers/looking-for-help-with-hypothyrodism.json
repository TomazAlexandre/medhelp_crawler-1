            "answer": "A thyroid imbalance can affect blood glucose/insulin. I worsened my insulin resistance and developed diabetes due to hyperthyroidism. Just to add, I also have never had an abnormal blood glucose but severe insulin resistance and pre diabetes which was confirmed on a oral glucose tolerance test (with insulin also tested).",

            "answer": "Please post your most recent thyroid related test results.\u00a0\u00a0You should be getting testing regularly for Free T3, Free T4 and TSH.Tirosint is a T4 only medication, but since T4 must be converted to T3 prior to use, if one is converting adequately, it helps both T3 and T4.\u00a0\u00a0You can only tell if your conversion is normal if you're getting tested for both Free T3 and Free T4.Once you post those results, with reference ranges, we can tell whether you need to push for T3 medication or not.Some doctors have differing ideas on what constitutes pre-diabetes and what doesn't, so that could explain the difference in opinion on that issue.Diabetes does not have to run in families and possibly there was a difference in the way you were eating here in the states vs in China or something... it's hard to say why there would be a difference.",

    "question": "Hi - I am looking for any feedback from others on how they are feeling having Hypothrodism/Hashimotos, even though you are being treated for it. I have been on both synthroid and tirosint. I was diagnosed about 9 yrs ago. I switched to Tirosint for the past two years, and have been doing well on it. The only problem I seem to notice is the brain fogginess that really bothers me. It has become really embarrassing lately and seems to be getting worse. I don't know if it is related to my thyroid or something else. I am currently living abroad. When I was in the states this summer, my endo did a 5 hr glucose test because of my symtpom complaints, and my results made it seem like I am prediabetic. The only thing is I have no idea how?! It does not run in my family, I am very fit (work out 5 days a week), eat very healthy, low carbs, no soda, high protein and tons of water. When I came back to China, I followed up with an endo here. He is a doctor from the US. He did another glucose test and said I am fine. No prediabetes. Frustrating on the two opinions of the doctors. I had many other tests run to try and help understand why I have the brain fog and sometimes dizziness. Everything came back normal. I read so many other people talk about how the tirosint only helps for T4. I am not sure if I should be demanding to be on T3 meds as well?Does anyone have any experience with this or suggestions for me?Thank you!",
