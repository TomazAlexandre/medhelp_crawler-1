Lower carb load per meal (low carb does not mean you can't have complex carbs like vegetables.)2. Smaller meals more often.\u00a0\u00a0Like 4 - 6 meals per day, instead of\u00a0\u00a02 - 3.3. There are alternatives to drugs that for some people are very effective.\u00a0\u00a0Check out the book \"The Blood Sugar Solution\" by Dr. M. Hayman.",
