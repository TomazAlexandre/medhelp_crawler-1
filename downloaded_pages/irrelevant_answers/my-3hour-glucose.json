But my fasting rate is extremely good, 3.4! And that was after a coffee and chocolate freddo frog!!! So don't stress. Keep eating healthy. And look forward.

And they found out i have gestational diabetes now i have to check my glucose levels 5x's a day. Feel blessed. You may not develop it and if you have a family history you could be more likely to but, it's not a definite yes. Just be mindful of what you eat and drink. Drink plenty of water.",
