            "answer": "Sometimes when you read about a diseases and its symptoms, you start to think that you have them... I would recommend that you- and when you feel like wanting to search about something on google - Try to search about something positive.. Like how to bake biscuits for instance..And go see a doctor to discuss the diseases that you \"think\" you have.The internet can give you general ideas and cases but seeing a doctor live is the way to find out what you really have.Best of luck",

            "answer": "Well it is kind of like a double-edged sword.\u00a0\u00a0Some people can handle stress fine.\u00a0\u00a0It comes and then it goes once the stressor is alleviated.\u00a0\u00a0For others, like yourself, me and many other people, increased stress in our lives ends up exacerbating underlying issues that we have, for instance anxiety and OCD.So if you are prone to anxiety, then stress would make it worse.\u00a0\u00a0The same for my own personal demon, OCD.\u00a0\u00a0The above poster is right in that nothing good can come from a google search in this case.\u00a0\u00a0You will only find more things to worry about.There are many different levels of anxiety and you mentioned you have had only 1 panic attack.\u00a0\u00a0So what it comes down to is is this something that is taking up much of your day?\u00a0\u00a0Are you constantly thinking about health related issues, diseases in particular?\u00a0\u00a0If the answer is yes, then you do need to seek out the help of a psychologist in order to learn the techniques to use to help yourself get past this irrational thinking that is causing you anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0Also, they can help with any stress that you may have at this time in your life.\u00a0\u00a0Stress doesn't have to be outward, if that makes sense.\u00a0\u00a0Subconsciously we can be stressed and really not be aware of it.\u00a0\u00a0You think something isn't bothering you but deep down inside it is.So analyze what your day-to-day life is and decide if seeing a psychologist is what you need at the moment.Take care.",

    "question": "For the past month and a half I have constantly been google'ing different diseases I think I have ( HPV,\u00a0\u00a0Brain Tumor,\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes) I have only had 1 Anxiety attack and that was at the thought I had HPV.
