            "answer": "First of all, keep in mind that I am unable to diagnose you because I am unable to examine you, this forum is for educational purposes.The symptoms and story that you describe are most likely related to nerve damage related to your diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes can affect the nerves in several ways, one is peripheral nerve damage (the so called 'diabetic neuropathy'), and the other is automonic neuropathy (the autonomic nervous system controls things like tempature regulation, heart rate variability, blood pressure regulation, and gastric/bowel transit).\u00a0\u00a0I do not suspect that you have a pinched nerve for the story you have related ( a pinched nerve should give a focal defect, not the whole body).\u00a0\u00a0I would recommend that you get and EMG(nerve muscle test), QSART test (for autonomic neuropathy) and screening blood work (to look for other causes than diabetes) including b12, ana, tsh, monoclonal protein in serum and urine, copper level, ceruloplasmin, vitamin E level, and B6 level. I hope this has been helpful.",

About a week ago it started back up and now its all of my body.I have total body numbness, tingling, and or warming effect. It goes from legs to my head.Even my privite part are effect with the warming feeling.I have a spilting headache that feels like I have a vice grip too.Ive also feel weak in my legs and arms.So I was wondering if diabetic neuropathy would effect my whole body like this.My doctor doesnt want to even consider anything else since I am a diabedic. But from what ive read online diabetic neuropathy should manly effect my legs and arms not my whole body.Thank youGarrett",
