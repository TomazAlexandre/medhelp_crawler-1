            "answer": "Don't call yourself stinky.\u00a0\u00a0Alot of people deal with odor.\u00a0\u00a0Some odors can be caused by diabetes, yeast, bacteria, infection, medications, excessive sweating, other secretions, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I promise you that there is a time that every person in your office has not exactly smelled like roses.Make an appointment with your doctor and let he/she know what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe they can find the cause of it and help treat the problem.\u00a0\u00a0It may just be a simple switching of medications.In the mean time try this:Dont take hot baths or showers, try luke warm water.Shower or bathe only once a day unless you have excessive sweating or you are really dirty.\u00a0\u00a0Bathing too much will dry out your skin.Do not use scented soap or body wash.\u00a0\u00a0This can add to the issues that may be causing\u00a0\u00a0the odor.*This is my favorite because this is what I do-carry a small travel size bottle of Febreeze with you.\u00a0\u00a0Do not spray your body, but spray your clothes a few times throughout the day.\u00a0\u00a0You can also spray around the area you are in if you are worried about air quality of others.\u00a0\u00a0The odor is probably being secreted through your skin\u00a0\u00a0(cannot remember what the condition is caused) and it can collect on your clothing.\u00a0\u00a0The Febreeze can help your clothes smelling fresh.Again, do not call yourself stinky.\u00a0\u00a0You have a medical condition that you cannot help.\u00a0\u00a0Others should be sensitive to your situation.\u00a0\u00a0Also, get your blood pressure down a little more.\u00a0\u00a0You should be seeing your doctor regularly for blood pressure checks, if you are not already.\u00a0\u00a0Do not be afraid to talk to your doctor about the problem you are having.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors are there to help you, so make sure that you accept that help.I hope things get better for you.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
