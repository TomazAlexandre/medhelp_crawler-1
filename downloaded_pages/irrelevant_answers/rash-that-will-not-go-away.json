    "question": "I am a 42 year old woman & had 2 kids via C-sections 18 years ago. My scar has been very faint for a long time until recently. Not only have I developed a reddish yellow rash but I have also has a rash in between my buttocks area. I swells, itches and bleeds and my urine is very fowl smelling regardless of the amount of water I drink daily which is alot. In addition, I also have a rash right under my bra line to mid stomach which is like red patches and itches.\u00a0\u00a0I am a very clean person when it come to hygiene so not sure why I am having this issue. I went to the doctor after trying many itching lotions and powers for over a month with no success. She said it was probably fungi infection and sent me home with a strong antibiotic cream to use three times a day. I have faithfully use the cream for a month now with no improvement. The rash is getting worse.\u00a0\u00a0Please help!",
