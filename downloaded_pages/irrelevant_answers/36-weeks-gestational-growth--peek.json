I only ask because some docs will just do fundal heights witch are not terribly accurate.How has your diet been? Fluid levels? These are all questions that need to be answered before the cause can be figured out and of course no one can tell you when to consider induction except your doc. Wish I could be more help.",

If I go this week and it has dropped more, at what point should I be worried?\u00a0\u00a0I am 36 weeks and last week he measured about 38 weeks..... I guess what I want to know is at what point is early delivery necessary?",
