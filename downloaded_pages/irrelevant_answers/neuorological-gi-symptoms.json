            "answer": "The parasympathetic nerve system in the body controls GI motility. The pathway for these nerves goes from the control center deep in the brain (the hypothalamus and some brainstem structures) down the spinal cord and exits the spinal cord to run in the splanchnic nerves to the GI system.Disorder that involve this nervous system can affect GI motility - such as diabetes, other autonomic neuropathies. These can be tested for directly by a gastric empyting test, and other general tests of autonomic nerve function of the heart, and sweating system. An isolated disorder of the GI tract would be very unusual though.There is a congenital (from birth) condition of absence of the part of this nervous system in the wall of the bowels,\u00a0\u00a0called Hirshsprungs disease causing severe bowel immotility. Usually this presents in infancy, but can present later. Diagnosis is made by examination of a rectal biospsy under the microscope.Good luck",

            "answer": "Are you under alot of stress???? I know this sounds like a commonly asked question. I am 32 and for the last 3 years I have experienced the same problems plus major nuerological problems(weakness,vision problems, unexplained pain, etc.). I went to every doctor but no one gave me an explanation. A couple of doc's thought I had MS. Have you had a colonostopy? I do not know if I spelled that right. If not ask your doctor to give you one just to make sure there is no problem there. I had one about 6 months ago and had several problems, and they also scopped my stomach and found a small lump(they did not do a biopsy). I know if I eat to much I get a \"float\", kind of sensation. Caffeine also aggrivates this and if you have bowel problems definetely stay away from caffeine. Doctors also tell you to eat lots of fiber, which I always did, but it seemed to make diestion and illimination worse. I stopped eating wheat and it has helped alot. As far as Stress, it causes many problems in the body some can be very severe. Good luck and I hope you find your answers. I just gave up on med's and doc's and experimeted with holistic practices.",
