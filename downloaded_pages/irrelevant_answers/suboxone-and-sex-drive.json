            "answer": "well i have been on it for 8 months, i take 3 8mg a day. its wierd at first i loved it. i could go for hours and then orgasm. but lately i have no problem getting it up but its very difficult to orgasm. and i last for hours. she is happy but well i like to finish if you know what i mean. it seems to take 3 days to get out of your system. so if you want to have one good night of sex take off 3 days then do it. but trust me its not you its the drug. i know i'm very capable sex wise so it does not bother me. i never had any problems before i started taking suboxen. so i quess do what you want. just know its not you its the drug. frank",

            "answer": "I met my husband two and a half years ago. We dated for 8 months and had the most mind blowing sex of my life (constantly I might add). We moved in together and I noticed his sex drive was no where near what it was prevously. He has Type 1 Diabetes, so he chalked up the lower sex drive to the Diabetes. We then got engaged. Then we got married last year which was amazing since he is an incredible man. I found out a month later that he was on Suboxone and that he has been on the prescription for 5 years.\u00a0\u00a0He still claims that his low sex drive is due to Diabetes which may very well be the case. He is in his mid-late 30's so age may even play a role. I want to be a supportive wife as I love him dearly. I must admit that my frustration grows daily. I am a very healthy sexual woman who has a very high sex drive. In the last 7 months of being newlyweds, I feel that I am constanty begging to have sex with him and he CONSTANTLY refuses/denies my attempts. We had sex daily on our honeymoon but after that, it would only happen maybe once a month if that. Don't get me wrong, along with the sex comes that deep level of intimacy and love. I take my wedding vows to heart and love my husband very much so (which is the only reason for me posting this) I have gone to see my therapist, I started working out again and still can't get away from this feeling of being undesireable through the eyes of my husband. It has taken a serious toll on my mental wellness. I started having thoughts that maybe there was another woman and other crazy thoughts when I know darn well that he is a good man and would not do something like that. Due to our more frequent arguments, I've asked him to go to marriage counseling but he refuses to go. He says that marriage counseling would be the end of us.\u00a0\u00a0It makes me feel like he is afraid to go to counseling because he doesn't want a therapist to tell him to get off Suboxone. Essentially, I feel like he is picking the Suboxone over me. That may sound selfish and some posters may beat me up over the comment but I am just being real. Since we are both 36 and want to have children, I feel like us having babies may or may not happen. I would greatly apprecate any guidance from anyone who has had similar experiences or who is willing to give some good\u00a0\u00a0insight and/or recommend any good support groups.",
