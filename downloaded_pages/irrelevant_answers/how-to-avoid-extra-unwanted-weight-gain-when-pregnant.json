            "answer": "I was a size 18/20 before I got pregnant (though I am 5'9\"). My doctor advised me not to gain more than 10-15 lbs the whole pregnancy. So far I'm 32 weeks and have gained 8 lbs. Of course, I have been extremely nauseated so that is a big part of it.However, just make sure you eat right and start walking, as your pregnancy progresses you will feel like doing less and less so start doing it early!Once I started eating healthy I was surprised at how many different foods I liked that I would have never eaten before when I was eating unhealthy. Even things like broccoli and cauliflower and fish - I *never* ate those before and now I like them!",

I ended up gaining about 30lbs because of how swollen I was but all of it went away pretty quickly since it was mainly water weight.Have you done a pregnancy test yet???????",

    "question": "if a woman 5'3, weighs around 190+ pounds and she gets pregnant, how can she avoid gaining extra weight other than what is expected. i'm kinda in this situation but i'm still not sure if i am pregnant or not. i would still like to know either way it goes for future reference. also, diabetes and high blood pressure runs in my family on both my mom and dad side so i know i'm going to have to watch what i eat and keep a diet healthy enough for a growing baby. i really don't want to gain more weight than i have to b/c it's goin to be really hard for me to lose and it's not good for me b/c of my family health history. any suggestions (on diet & exercise) from women with similar body types that got pregnant would be great. thanks!\u00a0\u00a0:o)ps--- i know i will gain weight...that is a given, i in no way want to jeapordize a gift from God by being egotistical with how i look...i just want to avoid a life threatening health issues, diabetes & high blood pressure. i lost an aunt due to high blood pressure while she was going through labor so you can see why i am worried.",
