            "answer": "There are no doctors on this board, mhkhatri; only other people with diabetes. Your medical questions are very specific and I would direct them to your doctors. The only thing I can comment on is that your blood sugar levels are too high. You want your fasting to be under 120, preferably under 100 and your pp under 140. You are at risk for complications at the level you are maintaining. I would suggest a change in medication, or talking to your doctor about beginning insulin.",

            "answer": "I'm sorry, I just sorted through your post and noticed that you are on insulin. But your description is odd. You say you take 15 units AFTER breakfast, lunch and dinner?? This is not the correct way to take bolus (fast-acting mealtime) insulin. You should be taking it BEFORE your meal, usually around 15 minutes. If you take it after, and especially if you eat a lot of carbs, it will not have a chance to act before the carbs are digested. Also, a set dose of 15 units does not take into account what you are eating. You need to develop an insulin:carb ratio where you know how much insulin you need for whatever carbs you are eating. A way to figure this is to start with 1 unit of insulin for 15 carbs and then work up or down depending on whether you are in target 2 hours after eating (under 140). I recommend Using Insulin by John Walsh as not all doctors know how to do insulin carb ratios. Set doses are not very effective, as shown by your blood sugar.",

            "answer": "It is good that you take your Nova Rapid 15 minutes before eating. You should definitely talk to your doctor about an Insulin:Carb ratio instead of a set dose.As far as losing weight, there are a number of ways to do that. Just lowering your carb intake will help you both to lose weight and better control your blood sugar. Things like rice which may be a regular part of your diet, may just not work for you as a diabetic. But since you have some other health problems you might want to work with your doctor to establish a weight loss diet. I'm sending you a website by private message where you can talk with many more diabetics and there is a whole thread on diet and weight loss for type 2's.",
