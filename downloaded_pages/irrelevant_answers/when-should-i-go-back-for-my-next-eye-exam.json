    "question": "I had my last eye exam January 17th of 2008. I went because I noticed I had been seeing a bunch of floaters, I went to both a optometrist who could not see anything wrong with my eye but then recommended me to go to an ophthalmologist to get a visual field exam. He saw nothing wrong with my eye, did not detect any glaucoma or any eye diseases.I am a 23 year old male, about 100 lbs over weight, currently working on my weight with diet and exorcise, I am of mixed race. Mostly white and native American Indian. I use the computer a lot.I dont use any glasses and can read really well. No eye injuries like being hit in the eye or any of the sort.When should I go back for an eye check up? Also can any eye diseases infect the eye in a one year span after an eye exam? Thank you",
