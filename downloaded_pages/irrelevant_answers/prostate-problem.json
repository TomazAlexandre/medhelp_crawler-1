            "answer": "Hello,Without examination confirmation of a diagnosis is tough but urge of frequent urination can be due to increased intake of fluids or diabetes mellitus.Other possibilities are glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis(inflammation of the kidneys),urinary tract infection,hypercalcemia,hypokalemia(low potassium),hyperthyroidism,hyperparathyroidism and diuretic drugs.In my opinion, investigations like kidney functions, blood sugar levels, ultrasound lower abdomen(already ruled out kidney causes) ,intravenous pyelography , thyroid function tests and cystoscopy may be needed to confirm a diagnosis.I sincerely advise you to consult a urologist or nephrologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.Kind regards.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your evaluation and your advice.I just hope I can find a doctor that can help me and not push a bunch of drugs that have all the wrong side affects and the wrong results. I've been on Flomax ( stuffed up my sinuses so bad I couldnt breath) and a couple others I cant remember that I dont remember working and had the surgery that I figured would cure all, but doesnt seem to be the answer either.May be I just have a over senitive prostate or bladder, I dont know.Well we'll see what happens.Randall ( bull elk )",
