    "question": "Ok so I just got my results for the 1 hour test and it was 149 and so I have to go back and have a 3 hour fasting test in the morning. Is 149 bad or just Ok? I know nothing about glucose levels and just curious if anyone has gotten around what I did and passed the 3 hour test. I know everyone is different just wanted to know. All my blood work has been off this hole pregnancy and they can't explain why. Baby girl looks great and has been measuring 3 days behind so it's not like she's big. I'm 27+4 and doing good so far other than up and down blood pressure but I had that with my son last year. Any help would be great. Thanks!!",
