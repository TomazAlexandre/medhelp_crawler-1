    "question": "Hi,I am a 24yo male and about 9 months ago, I had a viral infection and strep throat with a high fever, soar throat, rash (not itchy), weakness, etc. I took antibiotics for it and was fine for 2 weeks then it came back. I took another round of antibiotics and was fine for a week when minor symptoms appeared again. within a few days they were gone so i didn't go to the doctor. A few months later I had sever diarrhea that last five days. Between then and now, I've had minor fever, weakness every so often and abnormal stools. In the past month, I got a dry mouth, leading to weakness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea (tan colored). I am not the kind of person who goes to the doctors often so I put off the dry mouth for three weeks and when I got sicker I made an appointment. The doctor mailed the blood test results back to me with the only thing saying \"for the liver function tests: elevation in one test only. please keep scheduled appointment in one month to test again and discuss further.\"What does that mean? Should I call and get more information? Should I wait that long without treatment? I still have the dry mouth and have periods of weakness, stomach pain and diarrhea. Does this sound like hepatitis?Thanks",
