            "answer": "The answer to your first question about erectile disfunction is probably not. The average age here is probably in the upper forties to uper fifties and at that age there's a multitude of things that can cause this sort of problem. The first thing to do is speak to a knowledgable medical practitioner about the amount of liver damage that you have. Many people have hep C and have to do little about it except abstain from drugs and alcohol in order to keep the symptoms in check. Others are not so lucky. only a doctor could tell you that.",

            "answer": "Hi there,ED isn\u2019t normally associated with HCV; but it might be a sign of other medical complications such as diabetes or cardiovascular issues. Be sure to discuss it with a doctor; don\u2019t let this slide.One way to obtain free HCV therapy is to participate in a clinical trial; we have many members here that are in or have been involved in these studies. If you post your location, perhaps someone can suggest something for you.As noted above, it\u2019s not always necessary to treat HCV; at least, not always a rush. A good GI doc or hepatologist can help you evaluate the urgency by way of lab tests and liver biopsy; however this does involve significant cost on your part.If you live in the U.S., are you entitled to Medicaid/Medicare? Other health insurance possibilities?The medications can probably be gotten through the manufactures via their patient assistance programs for free, but of course, this doesn\u2019t cover office visits, lab and other procedure costs.Good luck, and welcome to the discussion group,Bill",
