            "answer": "Dear Lisa:Tingling can be from a variety of things, such as systemic disease (diabetes, RA, SLE, alcoholism, etc), structural lesions degenerative disc disease), tumors (schwannoma, meningoma), infectious diseases (Lyme, cat scratch), congenital problems (occult dysraphism), endocrine problems (Thyroid)... and the list can go on.\u00a0\u00a0It can also arise from non-physical problems such as anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0It might just be a good time to get a good physicial examination, some minor blood work and talk with your GP.\u00a0\u00a0As you can see the list is very long and without more definitive symptoms it is difficult to sort out the list.\u00a0\u00a0So, a good starting point is what I mentioned.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully, things will be normal and your symptoms will decrease.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

            "answer": "Or B-12 deficiency, usually due to malabsorption.Make sure your B-12 level is tested. If it is below 350, follow up testing of methylmalonic acid and homocysteine should be done to validate the level or expose it as a false normal.Of course, the easiest thing to do is take 1000 mcg B-12 per day, and make sure you're getting appropriate quantities of other vitamins and minerals that the B-12 works with.Extra B-12 is excreted in the urine, so it's a safe experiment. Give it time; it's not a quick fix, but if low B-12 is your problem it is the only thing that will keep it from getting worse.rose",

    "question": "Dear Dr.I have recently noticed that when i cough i feel tingling in my legs. This is felt mostly on the top of both thighs. Occassionally, I also notice a sensation on both shins.This sensation is like a faint, cool breeze blowing across them without the breeze...........strange. Also, sometimes at night, I am lying in bed and get this strange sensation of vibration. It is like feeling vibration from machinery......but no machines are around.....this only happens when I am going to sleep.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering what kind of tests you might suggest.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if these symptoms are really bad enough to bother my GP with or not. Could a pinched nerve in the hip cause these kind of symtoms without major pain? Any idea what could possibly be causing these sensations? Your input and suggestions will be very appreciated.......",
