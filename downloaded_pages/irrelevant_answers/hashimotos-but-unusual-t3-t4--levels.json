            "answer": "What are the reference ranges for the Free T3 and Free T4?\u00a0\u00a0Ranges vary lab to lab and have to come from your own lab report, but your results seem very high compared to what we normally see.None of the issues you mention are cause to increase syntthroid, with FT levels already as high as yours and risk sending you into hyper he!!The A1c does indicate pre-diabetes, otherwise known as insulin resistance, which is another major cause for weight gain/inability to lose.\u00a0\u00a0Proper diet and exercise should help, considerably with that.\u00a0\u00a0Pre-diabetes, high cholesterol, overweight are all symptoms of metabolic syndrome.Vitamin D should be supplemented to get levels up to between 50 and 80.If he thinks you are risk for heart disease the dumbest thing in the world is to increase your thyroid med and risk rapid heart rate, heart palps, irregular heart beats, etc...Elevated cholesterol can be a sign of hypothyroidism, but since you aren't hypo, I don't think that's your problem.\u00a0\u00a0Some people are just prone to it.\u00a0\u00a0My husband is far from hypo and his cholesterol is much higher than mine.With levels like yours, there's no way I would increase my thyroid med; in fact, if it were me, I'd be insisting on a decrease, instead.\u00a0\u00a0Increasing Synthroid is not going to decrease the antibody count; nothing will.\u00a0\u00a0If he doesn't know that, he's not a good thyroid doctor.I wouldn't be comfortable just waiting to retest either.You have to do what you think is best... I'll be off for the evening soon, but I want you to know that if you have any adverse symptoms of over medication (wouldn't be true thyroid storm), you should decrease/stop taking your medication and go to the ER.",

            "answer": "It really isn't that confusing.\u00a0\u00a0The Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOab) are the antibodies that are attacking your thyroid, because for whatever reason, your body determined that your thyroid was \"foreign\".\u00a0\u00a0Eventually the antibodies will destroy it.\u00a0\u00a0Apparently, your doctor is of the believe that Synthroid can lower antibody counts and that lowering the antibody count will do some good... wrong on both counts.Once a patient has tested positive for Hashimoto's, antibodies need not be tested again, because Hashimoto's is for life, no matter what the antibody count is.Thyroid 101:\u00a0\u00a0The Free T4 and Free T3 are the actual thyroid hormones.\u00a0\u00a0The thyroid makes them both, but mostly T4.\u00a0\u00a0Of the Total T4 in your body, most is bound by protein and can't be used; that's why we measure \"free\" (unbound) T4, which shows the amount available for use.\u00a0\u00a0Free T4 can't be used directly; it must first be converted to T3.Most of the T3 in your body is converted from T4 by the liver, but some is also converted by other organs and even cells, themselves.\u00a0\u00a0As with T4, most of the T3 is bound by protein and can't be used, so we measure the \"free\" (unbound) portion, which is what's used by the individual cells.Rule of thumb is for FT4 to be around mid range... your FT4 is at 80% of the range - higher than need be.\u00a0\u00a0Rule of thumb is for FT3 to be in the upper half to upper third of its range.\u00a0\u00a0Yours is obviously higher than necessary.Apparently, your doctor is trying to use thyroid medication to cure what ails you, when it's not all thyroid related.\u00a0\u00a0He also makes me very nervous, in that he's trying to pass things off as \"age related\" when age doesn't really have much to do with anything.\u00a0\u00a0Too many doctors try to pass things off as \"that's normal for your age\", when that couldn't be further from the truth\".\u00a0\u00a0 I've known people much older than either of us not have near the medical issues we do.Insulin resistance can be caused by different things.\u00a0\u00a0I have it and I've never been over medicated.\u00a0\u00a0Typically,genes and lifestyle (diet and exercise) play a bigger role than age does.\u00a0\u00a0Admittedly, I've often eaten too many processed foods (simple carbs) that spike the blood sugar quickly, causing, in turn, an insulin spike.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin is called \"the fat storage hormone\"... it's not a simple process, but to put it simply, when we eat a lot of foods that increase blood sugar, then don't use that sugar for energy/exercise, insulin shuttles it right into fat cells to be used at a later time.\u00a0\u00a0If we just keep adding to it, and never use it, we end up over weight and eventually with too much insulin or our cells are insulin resistant or our pancreas can't produce enough insulin (at which point we become diabetic).Cholesterol can be another of those lifestyle (diet/exercise) issues and by watching what/how much we eat and getting plenty of exercise, we can bring it back into control.\u00a0\u00a0My cholesterol varies between winter and summer -- I have a winter neighbor that I walk with most days and my cholesterol drops.\u00a0\u00a0In summer, I'm on my own and it nearly always goes back up.Some of us are more prone to these things (genetic) and if we aren't diligent with our lifestyles (diet and exercise), we end up paying with our health.In your case, I do believe that a second opinion is definitely in order.",
