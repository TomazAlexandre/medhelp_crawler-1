            "answer": "Ok guys and/or gals that responded to my question, there are many reasons for not immediately responding to the urge: if I am driving and must wait to get to a location that has a restroom; I am in a business meeting and want to wait for the appropriate time to excuse myself; or, any other number of circumstances that any one of us encounters on a daily basis (unless you may be swimming with the dolphins and urinate about every fifteen minutes, as was reported as the average frequency of a case study I read about in a scientific journal article back in the late sixties or early seventies).I was diagnosed with borderline diabetes about four years ago and have managed to keep it under control with weight loss, moderation of carbohydrates and healthy diet, and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0I just thought there may be some connection that someone else had experienced.\u00a0\u00a0FYI, I also have an enlarged prostrate.The key point to note here is that the need to urinate sometimes comes quickly and at a time when I am forced to hold it and have a strong urge to go - that is the time when I get a tingling sensation.So, if I mayanticipate your next respones relative to your last ones, I should just go with the flow and enjoy the sensation.",
