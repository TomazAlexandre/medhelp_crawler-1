    "question": "My fingers gradually stayed numb all day and night...both hands and all fingeres.\u00a0\u00a0For the past week, my shoulders have felt \"asleep\" and takes all day for it to thaw; although they don't completely thaw out.\u00a0\u00a0There is also a twitching above my right eye that is getting really aggrivating.\u00a0\u00a0I've had these off and on for years, but now it seems to want to twitch more than stay still.\u00a0\u00a0I had a nerve conduction test about 3 years ago to help diagonse radial nerve compression and tennis elbow.\u00a0\u00a0At that time, the dr. saw more problems with carpal tunnel than the radial nerve.\u00a0\u00a0Could this cause the discomfort in my shoulders?",
