            "answer": "Some places have breast milk donations that maybe you could use? Formula is good and healthy for the baby. If you have to go back to work or school right away and need those medications, then I'd recommend just doing formula. But, yes, talk to your doctor and a lactation consultant.",

    "question": "I have a problem im not sure what to do I really want to breastfeed my son I breastfeed my first son 8years ago but this time there are third medications that would have to be changed in order to make that possible. One is for diabetes, changing that could be dangerous. The others are for adhd and anxiety, I need to go back on to be able to function to the best of my ability. But breastfeeding is so good for the baby is easier and cheaper. I feel like im being selfish in away if I dnt breastfeed but if I dnt have my meds. That could prove to be bad to. Any suggestions",
