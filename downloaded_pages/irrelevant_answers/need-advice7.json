            "answer": "It doesn't sound like the best option maybe, but there are literally thousands of parents who choose not to get vaccinations for themselves or their children. It is a personal choice. Also, people get sick all the time even with vaccines. Especially when you're surrounded by coworkers or a bunch of other kids in school.However if the girl is really thst sick I do feel bad, I'd hope that they are at least competent enough to give her medical attention and medicine if she needs it. If you feel that the parents are being neglectful and her life or health and well-being is in danger, I would contact child protective sevices",
