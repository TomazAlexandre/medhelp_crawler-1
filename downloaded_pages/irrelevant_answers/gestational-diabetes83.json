            "answer": "ive got it. and at 31 wks i was estimated at 4.5 lbs and thats just it its an estimate. my hope is still to have a natural vaginal delivery. ill have a c section if during the course of pushing i make no progress otherwise i think our bodies are capable of wonderful things. tones of women have had 10 lbs babies vaginal with no problems. if they are very concerned with babies weight they'll probbaly induce you early to limit the weight gained by the baby generally at about 38 wks which should make a natural delivery easier. but as ladies have mentioned they typically over estimated baby weight and why rush it when they could be completely wrong. i think a 9lbs baby is completely healthy and normal (i was expecting a big baby even before the diagnosis,\u00a0\u00a0my family makes them big lol) . id much rather have a 9lbs baby then 7lbs.sadly i think its alittle bit of a scare tactic on the drs part to tell you that your baby is going to be huge and then put doubts in your mind about what your capable of so you are scared into a scheduled c-section which is easier for them. do what feel right for you and your baby. hope that helps!",
