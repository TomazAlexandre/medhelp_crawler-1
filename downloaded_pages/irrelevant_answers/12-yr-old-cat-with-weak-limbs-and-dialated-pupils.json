    "question": "I have a 12 yr old cat that has displayed issues with her fore limbs, temors, and\u00a0\u00a0decreased appetite. She also has dialated pupils that are not reactive to light. I took her to a emergency vet hosp. Tuesday night. They drew a CBC, chem panel, and tapped her for a urininalysis. All of her labs were normal. They felt that she may have injured her fore limbs in a jump, etc. They gave her Meloxicam by injection and I gave her three more doses by mouth. She did not have the dialated pupils or tremors when I took her Tuesday. She did show minor improvement Thursday and Friday, but seems to be as bad if not worse now. She has spent the greater part of her day with her head under my daughter's bed over the last two days. I am concerned that she has a neurological issue. I would like to know if you have a recommendation. I hate to think that she is suffering.",
