            "answer": "My last one, I was barely 30 weeks and measuring close to 36 weeks he was growing 2-3 weeks for nearly a month then slowed right down and wasn't even 9lbs. I think I gained 7lbs total that pregnancy, the sent me for an extra ultrasound but nothing came of it and he was born a day before his due date. I think even in utero they have their own growth pattern",

            "answer": "I agree with the above. Babies go threw growth spurts before birth that could be all it is. I would ask how bit you are measuring at your next appointment and see if it's the same.",

            "answer": "I started measuring bigger 3/4weeks ahead about 20 weeks, I was told that it could be baby is tall (both my husband and myself are tall). My dr ended up doing a growth ultra sound to check fluid levels which I also am high on! Basically all babies are different as all mums are different! I haven't gained any weight (I was heavy before lost 30 lbs, gained some back but not extra). We are all different but your dr will keep checking you probably just to make sure...they may check you early for gestational diabetes.",

    "question": "So, today I have my check up and my doctor measures me and says I'm measuring at 29 weeks instead of 26 weeks. He says it's not normal, but he isn't worried. When I pushed the issue he said, I think it maybe because you have a little extra fluff. I'm not bothered by that because prior to getting pregnant I was heavy, but very athletic. My issue is that I have only gained 5 pounds throughout my entire pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I have also been measuring within normal range until this week, so I am a bit confused and I am a bit worried that, I maybe having a giant; LMAO! Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this?",
