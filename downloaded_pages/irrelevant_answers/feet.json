            "answer": "Judging from your symptoms I have to ask you one question: Have you been diagnosed with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes? Your symptoms sound very much like what I am going through with my feet: feeling\u00a0\u00a0like I'm walking on hot stones and my feet are constantly feeling hot and burning. The condition is called Diabetic Neuropathy\u00a0\u00a0where the nerve endings at the bottom of your feet fire off at a much higher rate of speed than normal which causes\u00a0\u00a0this burning sensation on the soles of your feet.The swelling around your ankles and feet could be a sign of poor circulation in your legs, as well. You may want to talk to your doctor bout getting an ultrasound done on your legs to determine if a blood clot may be present.",
