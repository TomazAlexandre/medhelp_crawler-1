            "answer": "yes, the vast majority of eye problems can be found during a dilated fundus exam.fluorescein angiography (FA) is only perfomed in cases of retinal/macular leakage or suspected leakage like in diabetes and macular degeneration, for example.\u00a0\u00a0not a test you would get for complaning of \"greyed out\" vision.ERG's are fairly rare.\u00a0\u00a0really pretty much used in clinical research settings to study optic nerve problems and neuro-ophthalmic disorders.\u00a0\u00a0also unlikely to get an ERG with complaints of \"greyed out\" vision.so why did your doctor not order more tests?\u00a0\u00a0he/she thinks or assumes this is a neurological problem with a visual manefestation.\u00a0\u00a0these disorders are nearly impossible to diagnose, and 99% of the time totally untreatable.\u00a0\u00a0so even if they ordered a bunch of expensive and time consuming tests, the results would very likely be inconclusive...and even *if* they came up with a diagnosis, there would also be a very high probability that it would be totally untreatable.",

            "answer": "wow, that's intriguing. wonder what blind people do with that 80%? well, i'm assuming it's not a tumor, since it's unilateral and i have no other symptoms as yet ... i had a CT scan in january after hitting my head and that was negative ... should i just ignore it for the time being?could it be a massive floater really close to my retina, or maybe kinda stuck to it, since it doesn't move ... (and doesn't look at all like my other floaters ...)i know, i know, i'm clutching at straws ...",

            "answer": "any eye or vision problem that s not diagnosed during an eye exam is assumed to be a BRAIN problem.\u00a0\u00a0that does sound scary, but:80% of your brain is devoted to vision.\u00a0\u00a0i'm not kidding.\u00a0\u00a0receiving the image, \"flipping\" the image, processing the image, fusing the right and left image wit each other, coordinating eye movements, visual memory, etc etc ad nauseum.\u00a0\u00a0literally only 20% of your brain is for everything else: breathing, thinking, etc etc.\u00a0\u00a0i am not exaggerrating.so if you have some problem with your vision, and your eye is FINE, then there's something wrong with some part of that 80% of your brain.\u00a0\u00a0MS, tumor, aneurysm, blood flow problems, migraine, etc...or even just perceptual problems with the way you \"process\" visual information.some of these are treatable with brain surgery or medications.\u00a0\u00a0most of them are not treatable.IMO the majority of vision problems not diagnosed during an eye exam that are also not attributed to any serious tumor, etc are probably untreatable.",
