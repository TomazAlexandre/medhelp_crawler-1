            "answer": "Good for you for doing your homework!!!!!I am not real familiar with the DM food however purina itself does not have a good reputation....and ur so right the fancy feast classic PATE varieties aren't such a bad food at all...as long as u stay away from the ones with gravy, they are very high in carbs.If Oreo will eat it that's a huge bonus, for diabetic cats I would stay strictly on the FF an NO dry at all.I wouldn't change Vets, they are mostly all very limited in what they know abt nutrition....they believe what they are told by the sales ppl of the high priced brands they carry.Good luck, welcome to our forum..",

            "answer": "Our Hildiekatt was diagnosed with diabetes a little over 2 years ago.Through getting her to eat less grain filled kibble and more lower carb wet food, she has dropped 5 - 6 pounds and it looks like she has gone into remission.She was at 3 units twice a day of Prozinc when we started and was down to 1 unit twice a day when he vet said 2 weeks ago to see how she is without insulin.I'm given to understand that kitties are one of the very few species that can heal from diabetes.We hope this is so.",

In another study, complete cessation of insulin administration was reported for one-third of the cats.Update on Feline Diabetes Mellitus, Dr. Claudia Reusch (WSAVA 2006):In previous years, when we did not limit the type of food our remission rate was 15%-25%. We were able to increase the remission rate to 50-70% by using a low-carbohydrate high-protein diet.\u00a0\u00a0(Remission refers to no further need for insulin.)Antech Diagnostic News, December 2003:In one study, 68% of cats with diabetes mellitus fed a carbohydrate-restricted canned diet lost the need for exogeneous insulin.",

    "question": "My American short hair cat has been a diabetic for two years.\u00a0\u00a0Our vet prescribed purina dm wet and dry formulas.\u00a0\u00a0Also, Oreo is on novolin 3/4 unit twice a day.\u00a0\u00a0He's 14 lbs, at diagnosis 17 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0Oreo eats very little wet food, never liked the taste.\u00a0\u00a0After doing some research, I discovered that some of the Fancy Feast classics are close to the same percentage of protein (some more) as the purina dm and they are low in carbs. For several days now, Oreo has been on the Fancy Feast, seems to like the flavor and is doing well.I'm just concerned because I asked my vet if there was any over the counter wet pet food high in protein and low in carbs and she told new no.Based on above info, do you think it's okay to continue with fancy feast classic? I feel like I should look for a new vet.Thank you!",
