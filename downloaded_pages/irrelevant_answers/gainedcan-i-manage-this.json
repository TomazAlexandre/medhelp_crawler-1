            "answer": "I just asked this question of my OB, since they're a little worried about my weight gain, given that I have a strong family history of diabetes. She says the baby really needs about 2000 calories a day, but not more than that. To just try to avoid junk food, eat proteins instead of carbs, drink milk, protein shakes are good. And exercise as much as I can...overall just try to do what you know is healthy, but not to try to limit your calories too much because the baby needs them.",

    "question": "Ok, so I took advantage of the fact that I started out 20lbs lighter this pregnancy then my 1st. So, I was pigging out a little, now I'm 20 weeks and shocked when I found out yesterday that I gained just about 25 LBS :( I'm sooooooo disappointed! DO YOU THINK IF I WATCH WHAT I EAT NOW, AND DRINK PLENTY OF WATER, I CAN KEEP IT DOWN TO THE MOST OF ABOUT 35 lbs (WORST CASE SCENARIO??) Is this manageable......I still have about 20 weeks left...............HELP what can I do to manage this......is this possible?",
