    "question": "I just want to say im sorry to each and everyone of you for not being on as much the last few days. As i was not feeling well at all on wednesday which landed me in the ER that night. All afternoon i had a bad headache, felt lightheaded, passing out feeling, and hot/cold flashes. They kept me for 10hrs to monitor me and my levels because upon arriving my blood pressure was 147/88 and blood sugar was only 84! My blood sugar worry was because that was after a heavy snack. I got pain meds, blood work, urine test, and a CAT scan. Which everything came back normal so no real answers as to why i felt so bad. Now all i can do is rest, take it easy, and wait for my doctor appointment next friday.I also would like to thank all you ladies for being so wonderful and keeping the chat alive here.",
