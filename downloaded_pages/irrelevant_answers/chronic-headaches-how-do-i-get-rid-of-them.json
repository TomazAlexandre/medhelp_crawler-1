            "answer": "Hi,A complete consult by an internist may be able to help. Get a thorough examination of the eyes, ears, nasal passages, and sinuses.Does diabetes run in the family?Have a complete assessment so that any underlying conditions that may cause your symptoms may be determined and managed. Also, avoid any unnecessary worrying as stress and anxiety may cause somatic pain and also alter sleep patterns and appetite.Fibromyalgia is not diagnosed based on exclusion.Its diagnosis follows a specific criteria.However, other underlying conditions have to be evaluated first.",

    "question": "Adolescent Sudden Chronic Headaches. They go away and comes back. How do I get rid of them??What are they caused by? Other symptoms include: Back pain, neck pain, fatigue, lack of sleep, sometimes I have excessive thirst, eye pain, bad eyesight, see diffrent colors sometimes, and I'm hungry a lot.My step dad had Acoustic Nuermoa, and that happens to like 1 in 100,000 people or something like that, so I'm positive I don't have it. There is no way my family is that unlucky. I doubt I have any brain tumors, as a matter of fact. Fibromyalgia runs in my family, but I do not think head aches and eye problems are a symptom of this. Please help!",
