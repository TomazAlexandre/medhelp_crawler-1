    "question": "Ive been having this weird sensatin down my left leg for months now. It feels like a cross between numbness, tingling, and pain. First I went to the urgent care unit and the told me it was syatica adn gave me a shot that didnt help. I went back to the my primary care physican and she had me do a nerve test which came back with results saying that I had carpel tunnel. Earlier I also had a blood test that showed my iron levels severly low and my blood sugar level slightly high ( I think only one point over normal). Even though I have gotten it checked Im still worried and now Im seeing a small bruise on my right hand near my thumb. Do you think there is anything I should be worried about\u00a0\u00a0or am I just being paranoid?",
