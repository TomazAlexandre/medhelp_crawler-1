            "answer": "Thanks for the information.....I think that I screwed things up when I went off the pills.....I am hoping that things get better after I have had a chance to be on them for a while - I have had several tests....EKG, bloodwork for thyroid, cholesteral (excellent), diabetes, liver, heart - had an upper GI which is how they diagnosed acid reflux.....am having a ultrasound scheduled in new year.......she says maybe it is IBS...but I am coming to realize that this can be a catchall diagnosis when unsure what else it could be....(I be stumped as one website calls it) Have only had a few episodes, and they have happened even when I am sitting at home totally relaxed.\u00a0\u00a0I have researched food intolerance - allergy sites and many forums say that symptoms are different in everyone....I am trying to stay gluten and dairy free to see what happens.....you should just try it out and see how you feel.....many of these people with allergies\\intolerances are initally diagnosed with acid reflux issues......anyway, it is nice to know that I am not going crazy and someone else has experienced the same.....it is just such a totally weird and bizarre experience when you feel this way....kind of scary",

    "question": "recently diagnosed with acid reflux....mainly stomach issues rather than throat issues....was on Zantec 150 for eight weeks...went off for two weeks and then developed the more normal symptoms...burning behind breastbone, little regur. in the throat.....feeling that food is sitting behind breastbone undigested (this on a very restricted diet of mainly plain chicken, rice, potatoes, fruits and vegetables)......now on losac for 6 days......I have been having some other strange symptoms that I do not think are acid reflux related....feeling light headed, weak generally not feeling well.....last for about 45-60 minutes,,then feel better, feeling chilled and tired - climb on the couch for an hour - then begin to feel better....weird body tingling and or strange sensation in the chest.....after eating certain foods...face get hot...not red...just feels really hot for 30-60 minutes.....I am beginning to feel like I may\u00a0\u00a0also have a food allergy or intolerance of some sort......anyone else out there have any of these symptoms?????",
