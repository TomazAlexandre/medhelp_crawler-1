    "question": "Hello, I'm a 22 year old male.\u00a0\u00a0About 2 weeks ago I began having pains in the lower pelvic area and frequent urination.\u00a0\u00a0When I drink a bottle of water, I have to urinate within 20 minutes, and then again roughly 20 minutes after that, ect.\u00a0\u00a0I went to my GP, he tested my urine and said it came back negative for a bladder infection, but he gave me antiobiotics anyways.\u00a0\u00a0It's been 7 days now, and there's been no improvement.\u00a0\u00a0I'd be more confident in the antibiotics if my urine hadn't come back negative for infection.Anyways, I still have frequent urination, and there's a pain that radiates from my lower pelvic area, sometimes to my testicle, and down my inner thighs (it feels like the pain is on a tendon).\u00a0\u00a0The leg pain feels like a stretching and now behind my right knee, there's some swelling.\u00a0\u00a0I also have the same stretching feeling in my right upper arm.\u00a0\u00a0My GP said the symptoms sounded like a bladder infection, but my urine tested negative for that and that was before I had the pain radiate down my legs and to my right arm.I'm going to schedule an appointment with a urologist within the week, but I was hoping to hear some likely possibilities first.\u00a0\u00a0Needless to say, I'm very, very concerned about this and I can't stop thinking about what could be wrong with me.Thanks in advance",
