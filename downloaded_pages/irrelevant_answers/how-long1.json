            "answer": "Hi.There is no accurate means of saying how long anyone has, but of course, there is the experience of other patients.While the presence of bone metastasis is not reassuring, it is not a herald of death within a few months.Much of survival will depend on what stage of the disease he is in, is he still receiving any hormones? If he is then this is a good thing. Patients who are non-responsive to hormones would have a shorter median survival (this means about half of patients reach this mark, the other half does better) of the order of 14 to 18 monthsAnother important aspect is how strong your grandfather is- whether he is able to carry out his daily activities with little or no assistance. Other issues are the presence of other diseases like diabetes, hypertension, kidney and heart disease. If he is perenially bedridden, the estimate of a year and a half may be shorter- whether this is only because of the cancer or his age/other problems.",
