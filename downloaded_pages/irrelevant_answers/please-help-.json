            "answer": "Hi!Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, muscle fatigue, pinched nerve due to wrong posture could be the cause. I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Hence if you take alcohol or coffee then cut this down. Sleep at regular hours and see if it helps. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes, Lyme's, lupus or hypothyroidism can also be the cause. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

            "answer": "Hi, i'm not a doctor or anything, but my friend had a problem where is limbs would get numb really easily too, although, i don't think it was just when he was sitting down. Anyways, he ended up having a lot of tumors in his joints that needed to me taken out. As for the twitching it happens to me all the time, but on the other hand, you could just be having really short sizers. I don't mean to scare you, thats just the only thing besides dyhdration that i can think of that would cause this. Definatly try drinking water before you waste your time going to the doctor. You should drink 8 8oz glasses of water a day, and for every 8 oz of caffein you drink (soda, coffee, ect..) you need to drink 16oz of water to make up for it. Hope you feel better soon ;)",
