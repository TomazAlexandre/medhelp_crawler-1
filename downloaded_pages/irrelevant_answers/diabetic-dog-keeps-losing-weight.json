            "answer": "Hi.Sorry to hear your lab is losing weight.My cairn terrier is also diabetic..diagnosed in June last year ad I know how frustrating it can be as the vets seem to just want to shove them on a prescription diet and leave it at that.If your lab is on WD then he is in fact on a diet food. High fibre is definately the way to go to help any diabetic dog but the fibre used in WD is actualy peanut shells...not very nutritious but a very cheap fibre.What your lab needs is a highly digestible food which has complex catbohydrates like brown rice and also a good and easily digestible protein like chicken.Burns nutrition do a chicken and brown rice dried food which my cairn does well on. He is gaining weight very slowly.I add a boiled egg to his food each day as this is also a very digestible source of protein and can help muscle gain without causing a big rise in blood glucose. I wish you all the luck in the world with your dog.Keep surfing. There are so many of us out there with diabetic dogs all of us scared to do the wrong thing for our pets. I have found home cooking also helped Max but was so scared in case I was gonna get it wrong.Here are some links I found helpful:http://www.caninediabetes.org/",

            "answer": "Could you please tell me if you checked your dog's blood glucose yourself or if you took him to the vet.\u00a0\u00a0My American Eskie was diganosed with diabetes 6 months ago he weighed in at 33 lbs and has gone all the way down to 22 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0I am taking him to the vet this Monday.\u00a0\u00a0He has a cup of food in the morning and a cup at night (Purina DCO), he is starving all the time.\u00a0\u00a0I know you mentioned the brown rice/protien diet - did you adjust the insulin or just give the same dosage?Sorry to ramble but i'm very worried about him - I thought I could take care of him as I'm an insulin dependent diabetic myself.Thanks, Hayley",

            "answer": "Hayley, you will get more responses if you start a new thread for your question.\u00a0\u00a0The thread that you have responded to is four years old now, and it's not likely that the person who posted it is still here.\u00a0\u00a0Also, people don't tend to read the old threads when they see them, and all they really end up doing is taking up room on the first page.In case you don't start a new thread, you should talk to your vet about EPI, or Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency.\u00a0\u00a0Dogs with EPI will lose large amounts of weight but will eat like they are starving.\u00a0\u00a0In quite a few cases the vets will treat the dog for diabetes only to have it be EPI.\u00a0\u00a0It's worth looking into.\u00a0\u00a0The syndrome is caused by the dog underproducing and secreting insufficient amounts of digestive enzymes from the exocrine portion of the pancreas.\u00a0\u00a0Most dogs with EPI can be successfully treated, although they will usually not ever regain the weight they lost.\u00a0\u00a0They will, however, not lose any more weight as long as the enzymes being supplemented are sufficient.Ghilly",
