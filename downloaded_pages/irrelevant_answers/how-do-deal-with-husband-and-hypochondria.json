            "answer": "Hey thegirl0526.Welcome to the forum.You say you're getting married in a few days.One of the foundations of marriage is Love.If you truly love this guy, which unfortunately does notshow through your post-and again it could be just pre-wedding jittersand nerves- then maybe give him the benefit of doubt.Whatever the reasons, the causes, the labels, the fact remainsthat he has some REAL issues, whether you or me or anybody else\"think\" that they are self-induced or not, does not matter.And trust me, NOBODY chooses to be a Hypochondiac,much the same as nobody chooses to have Bipolar.At another level perhaps there were some wrong choices made,that perhaps had some role in it, but\u00a0\u00a0the suspicion of him doing itconsciously and willingly is not going to serve you or him at all in any positive way.The best option for you is to see him beyond the symptoms andand the complaints, encourage him to seek improvement, and that you're there\u00a0\u00a0to support him UNCONDITIONALLY.After all, Love should be unconditional, right?Help him do some deep breathing exercises. The normal breathing website has some great info on this. It helps with panic attacks and anxiety.Get him a meditation CD. or find a YouTube video on this.If time permits, consider making an appointment for him with a Hypnotherapist, if he's willing to go for a session, and this will help him \"tame\" his issues for the time being. He may continue after the wedding with more sessions, however, I do agree with allmymarbles advice for the long term.Take care and congratulations on your upcoming wedding!Niko",
