            "answer": "\"I'm sure the doctor would not have prescribed Plavix if it would interfere with her diabetes.\"It is always in the best interest of the patient to question a Pharmacist about his/her drug interactions. The patient should always ask for a 'consultation' prior to or after having an Rx filled. Doctors do make mistakes, the Pharmacist may call the doctor if he/she feels something is amiss and/or has questions about the Rx.\"Plus, a pharmacist will not fill a prescription when he sees a drug interaction will occur\"Unless informed, the Pharmacist has no idea what other drug[s] the patient is taking. This includes supplements.\"Plus, a pharmacist will not fill a prescription when he sees a drug interaction will occur..\"Again, how would they know that? Pharmacist are not privy to a patients medical records nor do they have time to review them beforehand.",

            "answer": "Hopefully, the patient is getting all their medications filled at the same pharmacy and they do cross index medications that a patient is taking. They have a record of all prescriptions filled by them for the patient.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors do make mistakes and it's the pharmacist job to catch it, they are more knowledgable when it comes to drug interactions! As for supplements, yes.... they have no way of knowing and it is the patient's responsibility to let their doctor know what supplements they are taking and he will take this into consideration when prescribing a medication.\u00a0\u00a0But the patient needs to let the pharmacist know as a back-up. There is always a list of precautions that come with any medication that will also tell what you shouldn't take the medication with.\u00a0\u00a0 AGAIN.....most people get their prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy and they will pull up the patient's history and this is how they know if there will be an interaction.\u00a0\u00a0I've worked for several doctors and have dealt with many pharmacists as a result.\u00a0\u00a0Now if one chooses to go from one independent pharmacy to another, then they may be setting themselves up for a problem.\u00a0\u00a0Most use the chain pharmacies and they can cross reference any, and all prescribed medication from their store.\u00a0\u00a0EVERY pharmacist will ask if you have any questions about your medication, this is the time to speak up if you've been dealing with multiple pharmacies and/or taking supplements. Otherwise read the paperwork that comes with your medication.",

            "answer": "Right, I believe we are saying the same thing but in different ways. As I stated earlier, \"It is always in the best interest of the patient to question a Pharmacist about his/her drug interactions. The patient should always ask for a 'consultation' prior to or after having an Rx filled.\"\u00a0\u00a0It never hurts to ask to be on the safe side. I would do this with the same Pharmacist as I would with a different one.",
