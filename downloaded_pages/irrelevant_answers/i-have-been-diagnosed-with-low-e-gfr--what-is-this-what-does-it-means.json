            "answer": "What is your GFR?? And are you seeing a nephrologist? They can determine what is causing your kidneys not to function at their full capacity. It could be certain medications, diabetes, high blood pressure, etc. Also, anti-inflammatory meds like Ibuprofen and Aleve are not good for the kidneys. A below average GFR is not always bad... you just need to monitor it and it may go up. If it keeps dropping and dropping, thats when it becomes a concern.",
