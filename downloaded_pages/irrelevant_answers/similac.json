            "answer": "Certain batches of powdered Similac were recalled in September due to possible contamination with beetle larvae. After testing recalled batches, Similac found nearly 99% of product was not contaminated. And I know it sounds gross, but ingesting beetle larvae will not actually harm a baby. However, I do agree with Happynifer; if you can get a lactation consultant, sticking with breast milk is ideal. Otherwise, the formula you buy now should be fine (providing you did not buy this back in September). Good luck!",
