            "answer": "HiYou sound quite stressed out. Not sure why. You admit yourself that you were under tremendous stress while breast feeding? Why so?Stress also results in secretion of stress hormones which have weight gain as side effect. Also it depends on your level of activity. I know you have had many tests, but have you tested for diabetes and hypothyroidism? These two diseases could also contribute to pain, tingling etc that you experience in your back, apart from weight gain.The symptoms of pain etc. could also be due to nerves in your spine getting trapped due to pressure on your vertebrae due to weight.There is a remote possibility that you are suffering from transverse myelitis in early stage. Please refer: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/transversemyelitis/detail_transversemyelitis.htmA MRI is definitely needed, along with a consultation with an Endocrine specialist and a neurologist.Hope this helps. If you need more help, please feel free to contact. I\u2019ll be happy to answer your queries. Please keep me posted.",

            "answer": "Well, I was stressed out during breastfeeding the first year of my son's life because my husband lied about a job which caused us to lose our home and everything else right when I was 7 months pregnant, even health insurance.\u00a0\u00a0I managed to pick up the pieces and delivered a healthy boy and I lost nearly every pound I put on by pregnancy!\u00a0\u00a0But the minute I stopped nursing is when it all came down on me.\u00a0\u00a0Funny thing is that I was stressed before this wieght gain, not during.I was tested for diabetes and hypothyroidism, & scleroderma amongst others.\u00a0\u00a0I work out more now than I did before and am still gaining - 4 days a week for about 1 hour keeping my heart rate up at 155.\u00a0\u00a0I realize the weight gain can cause a pinched nerve, but I do not understand the pains that started before the weight gain.I was also hospitalized the same week I conceived due to a supposed liver infection.\u00a0\u00a0I never got a true diagnosis and was sent home after a couple days with an IV.I'm at a loss.\u00a0\u00a0I will check out transverse myelitis to see what that is. Thx.",

            "answer": "HiThanks for keeping me posted.I am glad things are ok on the home front now. You definitely need a MRI of the spine. Maybe the liver infection was of viral origin and that infected your nerve too. I think you need to see your neurologist too.Yes, there is a chance you have transverse myelitis as \u201cThe inflammation that causes such extensive damage to nerve fibers of the spinal cord may result from viral infections, abnormal immune reactions, or insufficient blood flow through the blood vessels located in the spinal cord. Transverse myelitis also may occur as a complication of syphilis, measles, Lyme disease, and some vaccinations, including those for chickenpox and rabies. Cases in which a cause cannot be identified are called idiopathic.\u00a0\u00a0Transverse myelitis often develops following viral infections. Infectious agents suspected of causing transverse myelitis include varicella zoster (the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles), herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr, influenza, echovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis A, and rubella. Bacterial skin infections, middle-ear infections (otitis media), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (bacterial pneumonia) have also been associated with the condition.\u201d Your symptoms too match. However since I have not examined you I cannot say for sure.Please let me know if there is any thing else. Please keep me posted.",
