            "answer": "Hi,Hope you are feeling better.Behcet\u2019s disease causes chronic inflammation of the blood vessels and is a very rare disease. Behcet\u2019s can involve the nervous system also and cause symptoms of numbness. However it is important to make sure that your symptoms of numbness are due to Behcet\u2019s disease or are due to other causes like diabetes, peripheral neuropathy or nerve compression. Behcet\u2019s disease comes in unpredictable cycles and can be well controlled with treatment if not cured.It will be a good idea to get yourself evaluated at Mayo clinic. Meanwhile exercises like swimming and walking when there are no flares help.",
