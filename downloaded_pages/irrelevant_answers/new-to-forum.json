            "answer": "A lot of doctors aren't willing to treat until labs are well out of range and symptoms are raging, or they want people to wait six months before retesting.\u00a0\u00a0So, your doctor's approach seems reasonable, relatively speaking.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps you could ask him to shorten the time period a little to the next test?When you're tested again, be sure that your doctor orders FREE T3 (FT3) and FREE T4 (FT4) along with TSH.\u00a0\u00a0FT3 and FT4 are the actual thyroid hormones and give a much better picture of thyroid status.\u00a0\u00a0You want to be about mid-range on both, but we can help you interpret the tests if you post results with reference ranges. Reference ranges vary lab to lab, so they have to come from your own lab report.By far, autoimmune thyroid disease is the leading cause of hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0The two markers for Hashimoto's thyroiditis are TPOab (thyroid peroxidase antibodies) and TGab (thyroglobulin antibodies).\u00a0\u00a0It would be well worthwhile to have those tested at the same time.",

    "question": "Hello, I'm new to this so here it goes. About 4 months ago I started feeling very fatigued along with chills in my extremities, muscle pain, foggy head. So I have a diabetes test done about a month ago and it comes back negative but high chlorestorol. Well yesterday my GP nurse calls and says I have abnormal thyroid levels. So I panic cuz I have anxiety disorder and chronic worry. Doing research it seems like I have it. Talked to GP on phone today he says my level is 4.3. And\u00a0\u00a0he will do another test In 3 weeks and if it's abnormal he'll treat it. My problem is waiting cuz these symptoms suck as you all can vouch for so I don't know if I should wait and suck it up or check another dr.. I don't want to get depressed again but I feel like I'm getting there. I'm a 44 yr old male. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance",
