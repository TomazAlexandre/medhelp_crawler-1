            "answer": "Hello,Thank you for the quick response. I don't have any numbness. Just tingling all over. It has been going on for almost 2 days now. I am a bit concerned mainly for neuropathy. I will definitely look into taking those supplements. Till than...does tingling always mean neuropathy or something serious? I've never experiencing this and it hit me pretty sudden. Don't feel any pain or crippling. More like irritation or this pins and needles feeling that is relieved by giving that area i feel it a little scratch. I appreciate the response!",

            "answer": "Hello again,I am not taking any medication at the moment. The only meds i have taken in the past few months was ibuprofen...which was to relieve sinus pain.This all started suddenly one early morning. I felt a nerve in my right arm and rubbed it a bit. Next i felt like i had rubbed the nerve wrong and it seemed like it plopped up a bit. Shortly after i started feeling\u00a0\u00a0this staticy feeling on my wrist on the same arm. As if i had pinched my nerve. As the day progressed i started feeling irritation all over my body. Its been almost 5 days since this started.I have not felt any numbness whatsoever since that day. Only tingling and itching. The symptoms do not seem severe\u00a0\u00a0just aggrivating. i mainly only feel them when i sit down for a long while or laying down. I recently went to the doctor today and told him about it. Hoping he would send me or recommend me to a neurologist so i could get an MRI. He didn't seem concerned and just gave me an anti-inflamatory med. I've never had any seizsures. I am not diabetic( been checked recently, clean). I had an MRI in January 2006 by a neurologist and was told they didn't see anything out of the ordinary. That all seemed normal.My main concerns are MS and neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0Aside from that i have also had some moderate stress in my life.Again thank you noops01 for your responses and advice. Greatly appreciated!",

    "question": "Only till recently tuesday night\u00a0\u00a0i have been experiencing odd symptoms. I am 19 years old. It started out during the night. I started feeling itchy all over my body. Than as i was lying in bed i couldn't sleep from all the irritation. As the night progressed it started feeling like a tingling feeling on my legs, arms, back, shoulders, and lower neck. It isn't painful...more annoying and irritable. Sometimes it feels like i get poked by a needle or nail. And is usually followed by an itch sensation and i of course scratch the area and it provides temporary relief. On my back i feel like a little zap. Mainly feel it upon movement. If i could describe the pain on a 1-10 scale i would rate it at a 2. None of these symptoms are painful just incredibly irritable and mainly lose sleep over it. Although the sensation i get on my back does feel a tad bit achy. Overall the feeling is almost gritty all over.I am clueless as to what could be wrong if it is serious or not. But i am very concerned. I have read about neuropathy and how it can be related to diabetes(which i don't have). But that is about all i can think of. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you for your time.",
