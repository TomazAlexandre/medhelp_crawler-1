            "answer": "There is not enough information in your post to provide a proper and full answer.\"I watch what I eat and track it everyday.\"Which is what? People say \"watch\" but eat the wrong types of foods. Are you on a restricted carbohydrate diet? If no it's time you were. Are you eating starchy foods like potatoes, pasta, white rice, or foods made with white flour such as white breads and crackers? How are you controlling and managing your diabetes? What are your daily glucose levels? What is also missing are the results of a medical examination. When was the last time you had one? Doctor said what to you? As you can see too many questions and not enough answers.",

I have lost a little weight by playing racket ball every day and occassionally jumping on the Just Dance game. Hey it's a fun way to work out. Don't eat late meals so that it will sit on your stomach. I also drink lots of water. I may treat myself to one cup of unsweeten juice a day if that.",
