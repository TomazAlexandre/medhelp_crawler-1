            "answer": "Although I cannot give a clinical diagnosis over the internet, the story you tell does not suggest a structural lesion like a stroke but a more widespread dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction or muscle - things like myesthenia, motor neuron disease, polymyositis, paraneoplasia.When you say he cannot speak, I presume its that he cannot make the sound to speak, rather loss of language skills (ie also comprehension, reading etc). If there was a generalized loss of language skills also, the diagnosis may be different, and more of a degenerative/dementing type illness rather than a muscular problem.I'm not sure what you mean by negative test ?tensilon test - this test is only useful if positive, and a negative test does not ruleout myesthenia. Other testing such as blood antibodies (binding, blocking, and modulating acetylcholine receptor antibodies or anti-MUSK antibodies), repetitive nerve stimulation, and single fiber EMG can confirm or refute the diagnosis. An EMG of the bulbar muscles (ie tongue) may be able to investiage motor neuron disease as a cause. Blood levels of CK, and possibly a muscle biopsy (after an EMG with supportive evidence) for a myopathy may be useful , depending on your doctors reccomendations.Good luck",

My father-in-law was diagnosed on 12/21 with ALS.\u00a0\u00a0He passed away on 12/23.\u00a0\u00a0His last week was mostly a period of severe breathing trouble.\u00a0\u00a0We wish that he would have been diagnosed sooner but was showing no signs other than the speech issue which his neurologist thought was related to a stroke.\u00a0\u00a0I guess my point is that if the ALS diagnosis had been sooner the family could have been better prepared. Perhaps in future cases this test could be completed sooner!",
