            "answer": "I went into early labor at 33 weeks with my second. I woke up and just felt nauseated. Later on I tried eating a bowl of cereal. I took one bite and a few minutes later, I was throwing up. Then as time went on, my stomach felt crampy. Not like period. Just like bad food or something. I started having a lot of bowel movements. Not a lot each time either. Finally that night, I went into L&D and they told me I was going into early labor. They gave me a shot in the backside of my arm. Which HURT. Not the stick, but the medicine itself. Luckily, it stopped my labor and I made it a day before my due date. I literally just thought another pregnancy thing was going on. Like morning sickness coming back. But nope, I was in labor.",

            "answer": "I had steriod shots because of premature contraction, fibroids in my uturis and im diabetic. I had them when I was in my 3rd trimester when I was in the hospital. They didn't really hurt and were on my hip but messed up my diabetes and MAY have lead to me having preclamcia a couple weeks later. I had a great hospital and even better doctors. I delivered a 10lbs 2oz baby girl at week 37 and almost 2 year later I will be expecting my 2nd daughter.\u00a0\u00a0Stay postive belive in your doctors!",
