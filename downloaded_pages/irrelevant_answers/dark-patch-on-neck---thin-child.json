            "answer": "His regular daily gummy vitamin has vitamin B12 in it.\u00a0\u00a0After reading the Wiki article about Pellagra it also says Niacin treats it.\u00a0\u00a0The photo on the Wiki article is way more extreme than what my sons skin looks like. There is no itching pain or peeling. Do you think adding Niacin in his diet would somehow help.\u00a0\u00a0He gets plenty of Trytophan, turkey sandwiches are usually his after dinner snack.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for the comment ;)",

    "question": "My little guy who is a superslim biracial child (white/African-American) has developed a dark patch of skin on the front of his neck.\u00a0\u00a0It looks a bit scaley in appearrance.\u00a0\u00a0It does not hurt or itch he says. In trying to find some info on what it might be, I ran across Acanthosis Nigricans, but it says it mostly occurs in overweight and obese children.\u00a0\u00a0Is this something I should be concerned about?\u00a0\u00a0I'm a little worried about the risk for type 2 diabetes if that is what this indicates.\u00a0\u00a0How would I get him tested to make sure it's not this issue?\u00a0\u00a0His pediatrician?\u00a0\u00a0A dermatologist? Could it be just a pigmentation thing because of of his biracial skin?",
