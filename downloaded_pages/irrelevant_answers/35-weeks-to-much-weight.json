            "answer": "My doctor said normal weight gain was 25 to 70 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0If you have gained 75 lbs then it probably will make you more tired and achy and short of breath and such, as weight will do. Can also increase chances of diabetes. But if you haven't gained 75 ( and I bet you haven't...) I wouldnt worry much at all unless your own personal doctor expresses concern. Everyone is different and gains differently. As long as you are active and eating healthy balanced foods you arr probably plenty healthy.",
