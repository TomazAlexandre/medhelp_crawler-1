            "answer": "Hello,This feeling of tingling sensations that you are having are called Paresthesia. Chronic paresthesia indicates a problem with the functioning of neurons.Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol?Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Common disorders causing paraesthesias are transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a neurologist is necessary to rule these out.Treatment will depend on the diagnosis.Hope it helps.In case you need more information then pls post us.",
