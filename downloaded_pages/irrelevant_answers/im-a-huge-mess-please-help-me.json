            "answer": "Hi,I couldnt see the picture. Could you describe the lesions to us in detail?The white spots in skin can be caused by a yeast called tinea versicolor, vitiligo, other systemic illness. The tinea versicolor yeasts are always around us, and usually cause no problems. Some of us are more susceptible to the things that can convert tinea versicolor yeast into forms that cause the rash: heat, oily skin, birth control pills, humidity, pregnancy and corticosteroids.Tinea versicolor yeasts are not contagious.Leucoderma, also known as vitiligo, is a rare skin disease characterized by white spots and patches. The white patch or spot is called as leucoderma and when it occurs without any preceding disease it is called Vitiligo.Some of the perceived causes are emotional stress, hereditary factors, worms, sunburns and physical illness. This skin condition can be aggravated due to diseases like hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia and Addison's disease.It is best to get it examined and reach an accurate diagnosis so that the appropriate treatment can be initiated.It would be advisable to consult a skin specialist for a proper clinical examination.Let us know if you need any other information and post us on how she is doing.Regards",

    "question": "I went to the dermo and he said that the white spots (mottled skin) I had on my arms was due to poor circulation. I was very nervous that this was a symptom of a larger problem as I have not felt well for quite some time. He ran a lot of blood tests that wont be back for two weeks. He was concerned about lyme and lupus.Had a lot of acne on my face and he gave me SpironolactoneNow I have these red welts on my skin (one on back is the biggest and one on arm also on hand) They itched a little bit but then stopped. I've included a picture. What could possibly be wrong with me!!!!???/",
