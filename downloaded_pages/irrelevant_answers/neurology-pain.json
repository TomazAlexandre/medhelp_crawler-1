            "answer": "Dear Jean D:Sorry to hear about your husband.\u00a0\u00a0What is the etiology of the peripheral neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0The neurontin will help with pain, but not due too much for the weakness.\u00a0\u00a0Cyanide exposure might induce a muscle weakness but usually not a peripheral neuropathy. The treatment of peripheral neuropathy is usually dependent on the etiology.\u00a0\u00a0So, depending on what your neurologist indicates is the etiology, then that will dictate the treatment.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",
