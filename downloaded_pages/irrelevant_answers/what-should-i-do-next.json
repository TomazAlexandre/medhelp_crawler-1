            "answer": "Hi,At this time you do not have diabetes based on those fasting blood sugar values you reported. At most, what you have is borderline impaired fasting glucose, which CAN be a\u00a0\u00a0prelude to diabetes in future.Is your thyroid disease autoimmune? (i.e did you have positive antibodies?). If you do have autoimmune thyroid disease, and along with that positive family history, I would suggest your doctor check an anti-GAD and anti-islet cell antibody, as well as c-peptide levels. Those antibodies mentioned are associated with Type 1 diabetes.Your gastroenterologist will be able to evaluate those liver tests and will likely also check for autoimmune liver disease.Hope this helps,Take care.",
