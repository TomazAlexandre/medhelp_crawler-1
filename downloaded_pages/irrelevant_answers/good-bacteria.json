            "answer": "Dear Kaya,Which brand (company that makes it) of infant/child BIFIDUS did you just try?Sincerely,Concerned lady***@****http://cantbreathesuspectvcd.comP.S. When you get a chance, go to the http://www.braintalk.org group of neurological forums. Check out several, including \"Bowel problems\", and \"Peripheral Neuropathy\", and \"Neuromuscular\", etc.Have you had a chance to read Dr. Julian Whitaker's great book yet, called REVERSING DIABETES? If it turns out that you are headed toward diabetes, this book could really help you! Diabetes CAN cause pain, because one of the complications of diabetes is \"Peripheral Neuropathy\".Many of the folks on the neurological forums are finding that they have either THYROID (hypo or hyper) AND/OR DIABETES problems that are causing them pain, from nerve involvement.See a GOOD ENDOCRINOLOGIST, to check on ALL the ductless (\"endocrine\") glands.An infectious disease doc might also be in order, as is a kidney type doc.Good luck to you!",

            "answer": "Hi I checked out the web site very informative, thanks.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think I have fibroids or adenomyosis as it said they would show up at the gyno or on an ultrasound, which I've had.\u00a0\u00a0The peripheral neuro is due to high blood sugar, I have low, I still wonder if the nerves that control my bowel function are compressed or injured as they exit the spine, They said if they were to see a chiro or acupuncturist, I have done both for a while to no avail.\u00a0\u00a0My \"Gut\" still says irritated bowel from taking too many supplements.\u00a0\u00a0Now the web site really scared me, one person said even taking one enema can cause your bowel to become stretched and it's very bad.\u00a0\u00a0(also abuse of laxatives) I have done alot of colon cleansing in my time. What is a stretched bowel and will it ever be normal again, they were talking enemas are terrible and you will have to have your colon removed because it isn't working, then I read if you take a laxative and you go it's still working, only if you take a lax and don't go then it's not working.\u00a0\u00a0I still can go with a lax just causes alot of pain, I think it irritates it or maybe causes peristalisis and that causes pain, the movement.\u00a0\u00a0now I'm really scared this won't heal itself and I'll be like this for the rest of my days which if I have to live like this I hope are short.\u00a0\u00a0Any insight? Thank You Kaya",

            "answer": "If your colon is stretched is that really a bad thing and would it be forever or would it go back to normal.\u00a0\u00a0What does stretching of the colon do.\u00a0\u00a0I probably did one colon cleanse enema once a month for ten years, but not retention ones, just holding the purified water with different things like lemon or bifidus, or slippery elm only for about 2 minutes, the retention ones for 15 minutes I've done about 5 total as per the nutrition healing book, they are big on colon cleansing and I thought I was doing a good thing and being so healthy, what do you think?\u00a0\u00a0I'm seeing my therapist tues. I see her once a week, she's great, yes I'm alittle depressed but mostly scared.\u00a0\u00a0Did I damage my colon for life with all these enemas.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you kindly, Kaya",

            "answer": "Dear Kaya,I don't know the answer to the enema question, but I believe there is always hope and help to get better, starting NOW.I do think you need to get the BIFIDUS into your system, somehow. One thought is to mix the powdered bifidus into whatever soft food your body is able to tolerate. The same could be done with digestive enzymes, in case you do have some chronic pancreas insufficiency due to those pain blocks, or something else that the docs did, or that you had, or due to any drugs that had bad side effects, or due to unknown causes, etc.I hope you will find the closest experienced Feldenkrais practitioner, who can probably help you a lot with the Slipped Rib Syndrome, and pain in general, and your entire body in particular, and even your state of mind. Feldenkrais is wonderful!Read over all my previous answers to you, and I hope that some of it might be useful. At this point, I will hold off giving you any more advice, because I think you need to start trying something different, or some better variation of what you have already tried. Others will probably have some original ideas for you!Good luck! There is always hope and help! We both need to take action, since computer work keeps us too much \"in our heads\" sometimes.Sincerely,Concerned lady",
