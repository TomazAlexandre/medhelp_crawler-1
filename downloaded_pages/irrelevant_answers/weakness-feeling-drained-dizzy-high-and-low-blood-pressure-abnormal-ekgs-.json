If you get swollen quite often I can offer one suggestion as I have seen with my dad, my dad has plenty of problems and he continually swelled up with fluid especially around heart and swollen legs, feet etc.\u00a0\u00a0Unitl finally he was diagnosed with congestive heart failure.\u00a0\u00a0Doesnt sound like it means,when someone has heart problems as you describe fluid will tend to build up mostly from the persons diet.After many hospital visits we finally found a cardio doctor who diagnosed him and mandated he stay off salt, and anything containing salt. he has been on a salt free diet and\u00a0\u00a0It has now been 11 months since this happened and he has not seen a swollen day since.\u00a0\u00a0He also has high blood pressure, history of heart attack and is on many meds inlcluding coumdin to ward off blood clots.\u00a0\u00a0Please go to see a cardio since you list many symptons similar.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you well.",
