            "answer": "Thank you so much for all your responses. At least I have an idea of where I might start. I am a 52 yr. old woman from the Chicago area. I was diagnosed with diabetes about a month ago, so my Dr. started investigating my blood. She came up with the HepC diagnosis and told me to start looking for a specialist. I have no job or money so I need free help. The #'s you gave me Izzy, is where I will start tomorrow. Fortunately, my sister has given me a place to stay, plus she is a nurse so she is very supportive.Once again, thank you all for your support and I will be checking in daily for the next couple of weeks. So I will keep you posted on my progress.Karen........aka..smiley9556",
