    "question": "Hi Doctor,When walking into a completely dark room, I cannot see a thing.\u00a0\u00a0What happens is after a couple of seconds, my vision starts to fade to black.\u00a0\u00a0If my eyes move, then I can see, but if I stare without moving them, it's total darkness. My day vision is fine, I have no peripheral loss etc., and I can see fine in dim light too.I recently saw a Retinal Specialist post-laser of a retinal break, and he said that my retina's look great for someone who has had type 1 diabetes for 20 years (I am 32 years old). There were small traces of retinopathy but he had to look really hard to find them.I am scheduled for an ERG in a few months, and he told me that he doesn't think it's necessary, but to do it anyway since I've got the appointment.My question is: are there other signs that an ophthamologist can see on the retina that would indicate RP? If not, he mentioned it could be the diabetes doing this, but not to worry, it's not sight threatening.What are your thoughts?",
