To read these posts, though, it's nothing but a source of anguish and fear. It's depressing.Yes, sometimes you can get STDs. Most are curable, some are not. But then again, you're far more likely to get cancer, or diabetes, or heart disease, than you are HIV. Sex has some risks, but jesus, life is full of risks. Bad things happen sometimes, and that's just life. If you really want to be safe, sit inside your house with the shades drawn and the lights off; don't ever go out, don't talk on the phone, stay off the internet, don't use your stove. Or, you could take reasonable precautions and actually have a life worth living.If your fears are keeping you from having the kind of life you'd want--having relationships, having sex, whatever--or making you miserable in any way, then see a therapist. Don't let fear keep you from having a fulfilling life. Life's already too short. Why waste a minute of it?",
