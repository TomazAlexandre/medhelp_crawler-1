    "question": "Hey everyone,So I've had issues with my eyes since I was about 14 (I'm now 18, 19 in December). Around 3 months ago I had a check up with my optician after 1 year, she prescribed me some new lenses and everything was ok for about a week or so. After that week I started getting blurred vision in my right eye again and pain as if someone is pushing on my eye. I'm deeply worried as my family has a history of glaucoma and diabetes (I believe both can cause the loss of vision?). So the issue is I can't remember if the pain was there before my new prescription or not, is this just a case of re-visiting my optician or visiting my doctor first with my worries?Thanks for any help and I live in the UK (as all thing medical here seem very different to the US)",
