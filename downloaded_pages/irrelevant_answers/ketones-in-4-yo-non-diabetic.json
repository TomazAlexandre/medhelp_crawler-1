            "answer": "Hi Lorit!\u00a0\u00a0I am a volunteer, not a medical professional, and a Mom of an 18 year old girl who was diagnosed at the age of 21 months.\u00a0\u00a0Please verify any information given, with your son's physician.\u00a0\u00a0I am not telling you this because I think your child has diabetes (his fasting bg's don't seem too high to me), just thought it may make you feel more comfortable knowing my story and give you a different perspective.\u00a0\u00a0Practically all of the folks that I've met through The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation over the past 17 years, tell of misdiagnosis of their child's diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0When my daughter was drinking & peeing non-stop, my doctor diagnosed a UTI and after a couple of days with no change, ordered a stool sample to check for infection there, and only when I insisted on blood work did the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes get made.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter was also losing weight, but when you're with them every day, you don't see this sometimes.\u00a0\u00a0Not to scare you, but to make you aware...my daughter's bg was 919 on the way to the ER and she seemed fine to us.\u00a0\u00a0Now that I know the classic signs of diabetes, and being a medical professional, you know them too, I can remember seeing many of these signs in my daughter.\u00a0\u00a0You need to go with your gut instinct as a Mom and an RN.Seeing that it is the holiday week-end, and you do have access to a bg monitor and ketone strips, I'd call first thing Monday morning and schedule some fasting bg work.\u00a0\u00a0Just to be sure.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to check his bg an hour after he's had a sweet treat and see where's he's at.\u00a0\u00a0Just make sure his hands are clean and there isn't any sugar on them!\u00a0\u00a0It may help to put your mind at ease.Please let us know how you make out with your son and try to relax and enjoy your holiday week-end!",

    "question": "Although I am an RN, I am still worried about my son.\u00a0\u00a0I took him into the doc this past Wed. for unusually poor behavior the past couple of weeks, and a couple of episodes of unrinary incontinence.\u00a0\u00a0I thought he may have a UTI or earache.\u00a0\u00a0They did a urinalysis and the only abnormal was KETONES-15 (low).\u00a0\u00a0They want to repeat it in a month. Never a fever, is a persnickty eater, but does have an apple and P.B. everyday and a whole wheat english muffin with cream cheese in the am, or toast with \"dippy\" egg.\u00a0\u00a0So he is NOT even close to starving! Why are these Ketones showing up?\u00a0\u00a0I did check a blood sugar on him (using my neighbors BGM, just for my own piece of mind.)\u00a0\u00a0He had not eaten yet and it was 119.\u00a0\u00a0I called to doc's office with this and they told me to take him to the ER right away.....?\u00a0\u00a0Well I didn't because he was awake, alert, and playing.\u00a0\u00a0Should I be concerned?\u00a0\u00a0I've checked his urine with dipsticks 2 times.\u00a0\u00a0Once he had a tract amount of ketones, and once it was negative.\u00a0\u00a0His blood sugar this am before eating was 98.\u00a0\u00a0Again, am I missing something here, should I be concerned?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
