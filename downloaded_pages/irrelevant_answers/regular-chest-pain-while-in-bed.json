    "question": "Last June, I developed flu symptoms and treated it as per my doctor\u2019s recommendations. After that, from the end of July and until now, I have felt a constant pressure inside the middle left side of my rib cage that regularly starts at about 3 AM while in bed, feels reduced as I get up and sometimes continues mildly through the morning. I never feel anything in the evening.I am a 61 years old male, 5\u201910\u201d, 165 lbs,\u00a0\u00a0have no hypertension, no diabetes, my cholesterol was high 5 years ago, but through watching what I eat, I\u2019ve reduced it to 64 (HDL) and 147 (LDL).I run 5 days a week for a total of 20 miles, walk a lot, ski every two days in the winter, mountain bike in the summer and feel no shortness of breath when I exercise strenuously.This past November I had both a Cat-scan of my lungs and an echography of my heart that fail to reveal anything except for some aortic regurgitation.I could live with that chronic pain, but before I settle for that, I would like to know what it is and if I should be concerned about it.",
