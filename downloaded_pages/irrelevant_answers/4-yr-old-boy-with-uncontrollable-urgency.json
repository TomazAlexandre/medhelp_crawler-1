            "answer": "I agree with the last comand. Your son most likely has a urinary tract infection. Get him to a doctor as soon as possible. Things can deteriorate rather fast. Watch for fever, sickness and other possible signs that are not normal. Most of all don't wait, get hiom treated as soon as possible.From my own experience things can go verry fast. From feeling not well one minute to having a kidney infection and needing to be hospitalized can take place in less then 4 hours.I cincerely hope that your son will be well soon.God bless,Ron",
