            "answer": "I have been thinking about this and the only thing I can come up with is your Metabolism, it may have sped up with the diet and exercise. Maybe have your Dr. check this? They can have you dose then test your Blood every few hours to see how your body is processing it. Diabetics have been able to cure themselves of Diabetes doing what you are doing so this too may be possible. Other then you taking another drug that negates the Methadone is the only other thing I can come up with. Hope this is a lil Helpful. I wish you well with the finish of your taper! lesa",
