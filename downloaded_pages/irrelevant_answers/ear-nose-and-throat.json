            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Understand your predicament. But please post this query in the appropriate forum, you will get a better feedback.The barium is showing effects due to decreased mobility of the esophagus and hence the stasis of the barium. This is structural disorder of the esophagus.This could be due to Diabetes mellitus, which can cause autonomic neuropathy and consequent slower motility of the intestinal tract. Medications to promote motility may help in emptying the intestines by promoting motility. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
