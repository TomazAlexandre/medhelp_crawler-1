    "question": "I was on here about a year ago asking a question about a large lump in the left breast. I am 26 years old and have been having annual mammos for about 4 years. I have many health problems. I have recently found a new or unfamilliar lump in my right breast. I went to the DR and they scheduled another mammo and ultrasound for the 14th. Shortly thereafter I noticed a tender spot under my right arm and a small lump. I am unsure where the lymphnodes under the arm are. I am not real concerned about the lump in the breast due to fibercystic tissue in breasts but the lump under the arm has me freaked. I talked to a friend of mine and she told me that my diabetes may have something to do with this. I have never heard of any connection between diabetes and breast lumps. Should I try to move up my mammo or just let it go? Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated.P.S. I have 3 small children and my greatest fear is that I will not be around to see them grow up due to my letting something like this go...",
