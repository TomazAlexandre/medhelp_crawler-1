            "answer": "You are hypothyroid, and it looks like the cause of the hypo is Hashimoto's thyroiditis (the elevated antibodies indicate Hashi's).\u00a0\u00a0Hashi's is an autoimmune disease and the most prevalent cause of hypo in the U.S.Your FT3 is below midpoint in its range, and your FT4 is very low in the range.\u00a0\u00a0T3 and T4 are the actual thyroid hormones and much more important than TSH in determining thyroid status. TSH, on the other hand, is a pituitary hormone and can be affected by many things besides thyroid function.\u00a0\u00a0Your TSH is within range (currently 0.3-3.0 - your lab is using an old range as most do) and actually fairly low in the range.\u00a0\u00a0This does not indicate hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0However, it is the least important of the tests.\u00a0\u00a0It's also possible that your FT3 and FT4 have been falling for a while, and TSH has yet to keep up.Do you have hypo symptoms?",

            "answer": "Do you think your doctor is going to be willing to treat you based onf FT3 and FT4?\u00a0\u00a0Many doctors think TSH is the \"gold standard\" and ignore symptoms and lower \"in range\" FT3 and FT4 values.You might be surprised once you get on thyroid meds how many of your other ailments will go away.\u00a0\u00a0Thyroid affects the entire body.\u00a0\u00a0When I was hypo, it was like I had narcolepsy.\u00a0\u00a0I was fine as long as I stayed upright, but the minute I sat down for more than about five minutes, I was asleep.\u00a0\u00a0Your fibro, depression, migraines could all \"really\" be thyroid.",

            "answer": "Good for you!\u00a0\u00a0There is absolutely no harm in a trial dose to see if it relieves your symptoms.Choice of meds is a very individual decision and one in which other medical conditions have to be taken into account.\u00a0\u00a0I'm on a T4-only med, but I have a heart arrhythmia, and T3 meds and arrhythmias do not mix.\u00a0\u00a0Usually, the first line of attack for hypo is a T4-only med.\u00a0\u00a0Once T4 is stabilized, then T3 can be added if symptoms are not relieved and/or there is a \"conversion\" problem.\u00a0\u00a0We all have to experiment with what works best for us.\u00a0\u00a0One hypo's heaven...Your mom should post her labs.\u00a0\u00a0If her meds were adjusted properly, she would not still be symptomatic.\u00a0\u00a0Just because she is \"in range\" does not mean that her meds are properly adjusted.\u00a0\u00a0The reason she is over 200 lbs. may have to do with still being hypo.\u00a0\u00a0She shouldn't \"just live with it\".",
