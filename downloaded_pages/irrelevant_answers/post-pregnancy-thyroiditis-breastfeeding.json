            "answer": "***********************/health/thyroid/thyroid-faq.htmlIf you are experiencing postpartum thyroiditis and are breastfeeding you should have your levels checked frequently to be sure they are within range.. An infant suffers no symptoms from the mothers thyroid levels..The only problem encountered would be a lack of milk production due\u00a0\u00a0to hypothyroidism.Postpartum thyroiditis is a painless inflammation of the thyroid gland that can occur in the mother usually within two to six months after childbirth. The cause of this uncommon condition isn't known. You may be at increased risk of postpartum thyroiditis if you have an immune system disorder, a history of thyroiditis or type 1 diabetes.If you have postpartum thyroiditis, you may initially experience signs and symptoms of overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), which may include rapid heartbeat, sudden and unexplained weight loss, nervousness, fatigue, and increased sensitivity to heat. A diagnosis of hyperthyroidism can be confirmed by blood tests. Treatment may include beta blockers to reduce symptoms.Later, you may develop signs and symptoms of underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), which may include unexplained weight gain, hoarse voice, constipation, puffy face, fatigue and increased sensitivity to cold. A diagnosis of hypothyroidism can be confirmed with blood tests. Treatment may include thyroid replacement hormone.In many cases, thyroid function returns to normal, which may occur in as little as a month or take up to several years. However, some women develop long-term hypothyroidism and need lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy.",
