            "answer": "I am stage 2 grade 2 probably for 25 years. I also wasnt sure whether to tx now or later. I had doctors explain that this disease has no rhyme or reason. Just because its a 2 after so many years doesnt necessarily mean the progression will stay that way. Unfortunately no one knows the answer to our question. I am txing now. You just have to listen to your gut and do what you think best for yourself.Good luckCharm27",

            "answer": "I am stage 2 grade 2 probably for 30+ years. I also wasn\u2019t sure back then (04) whether to start treatment back then or wait until a newer drug came out but here it is almost 4 years later and they are still on the drawing board or in trials. I also had doctors explain that this disease has no rhyme or reason but kept an eye on its progression. I guess the deciding factors were many but the motivation came from the blood work during that in between time.My reason for starting treatment was due to the fact it was progressing (not sure how to quantify its meaning by numbers over time or even scientifically) but I used the following;I had a liver biopsy in 01/04 grade 2, stage2, with a vl load of 4,150,000 copies divided by 30 years (rounded), would equal to about 138,333 replications per year over that time.Now, three years later 01/07, Lab Corp. HVC QuantaSure Plus (serial) showed that there was an increase of 550K or over the past three years and the replications had increased to 183K per year from the 138K over the past 30 or an increase of 45K per year.Others may look at it differently but it was enough motivation for me to start treatment.Hope this helpsJasperPs. If you should decide to treat in the near future make sure your ducts are in a row as far as time off if working.",

            "answer": "Hi,I was diagnosed in 2004, infected in 1982 (transfusion, like you).\u00a0\u00a0Over the past 3 years I've been an avid reader of anything related to HCV and tx. Having mild liver damage, I certainly found many reasons to delay treatment.\u00a0\u00a0 However, HCV not only affects the liver, as I found out last week.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with Type II diabetes having no risk factors -- genetics, weight, diet, etc.According to hepatitisresearcher, a most esteemed scientist who regularly contributes to this forum, HCV inflames the pancreas causing insulin resistance (diabetes).\u00a0\u00a0The pancreas is not the only organ HCV affects.\u00a0\u00a0HCV affects the total body and raises the risk for other diseases among them lymphoma and cryoglobulemina.Where I was once in the \"watch and wait\" camp, the diabetes dx has compelled me to take action and start tx in January.\u00a0\u00a0Tx is not without risks, too, so you're wise to weight the risk/benefits.\u00a0\u00a0However, the risks associated with HCV lie silently and as others have said, it's impossible to predict your rate of progression and what other diseases may arise.This is just one story in the concrete jungle.\u00a0\u00a0We've had many pro/con tx discussions -- you can find them by doing an archive search.\u00a0\u00a0In the end, after you've crunched all the numbers, you may have to go with your gut as mentioned above because there's so many variables.Good luck,Kittyface",

            "answer": "I just had a liver biopsy a few weeks ago and found out that I was stage 1 level 1. I am type 1A and have probably had this 30 years or so. My VL is only 240,000 and ALT is 48. So I must be slowly progressing. I have been holding off on tx for about 15 yrs. and I have decided to start TX after XMAS. The reason why I have finally decided to TX is the last 1 1/2 yrs or so I have noticed a steady decline in all my abilities. At first it was attributed to menopause then the joint stiffness was getting so bad I asked to be checked for Lupus and I was diagnosed with RA. The Rheumatologist just blew me off as soon\u00a0\u00a0as he found out I had Hep C. I am a very active person and when I get injuries they don't seem to heal anymore.I know TX will probably make everything worse for a while but I want this monkey off my back. I want to be able to go to a doctor and not have everything blamed on the Hep C. Also now I feel I am in as good a position family and work wise to take on this endeavor. Last year I almost got a divorce and thought OMG I can't do this as a single mom. So I guess this will be the true test of the strength of my marriage. The family is used to me doing everything but my girls are old enough now to help out some. My co-workers are supportive and know I work hard so I think I can get away with some slack. I have only told my boss so far but will probably let some others know if it affects my work.Some people would think I'm crazy to TX with such low stats but I think I will have a better chance if I do it while I am strong and healthy. I want to be in good shape as I age and be able to play with my grandchildren when I get older.I hope I don't regret this decision, I'm scared to ****less.I posted this to let you know we all have different reasons for making this difficult decision.",

            "answer": "First of all, what genotype are you? This should be one of the most important factors in your decision.If you're genotype 2 or 3, then treating now is a reasonable option, although one could still choose to \"watch and wait\".However, if you're genotype 1 -- the hardest to treat genotype -- then given your stats I would not treat at this point with stage 2 (moderate) liver damage.As you may or may not know, exciting newer drugs are in the trial pipeline that promise better cure rates in half the time. FDA approval of the first wave will hopefully be within the next couple of years.I suggest before you make any decisions that you take a weekend -- not five or ten minutes or an hour -- but a weekend, and backread threads both on this forum and the main forum here:http://www.medhelp.org/forums/hepatitis/wwwboard.htmlThis will give you better idea of what treatment involves, including the side effects both during and after treatment. While some report feeling better after treatment, many report feeling worse. Treatment can be very difficult and take a big chunk out of your life -- it did to mine. You say you have no symptons now, so weigh the decision very carefully.You should also keep in mind that since most here are treating --\u00a0\u00a0or have treated, or are going to treat -- that there is an understandable pro-treatment bias in this forum. Those whose doctors told them to watch and wait would probably be less likely to show up here.I decided to treat at age 58 when I was told I was between stage 3 and 4. I am now cured for 1.5 years and grateful. But based on everything I know and went through -- I would not have treated if I were a stage 2. Either then or if I could turn the clock back now.All the best in whatever you decide. As a stage 2 you could reasonably go either way. But do take the time to make an informed decision.-- Jim",
