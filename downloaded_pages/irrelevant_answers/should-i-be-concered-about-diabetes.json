            "answer": "\"had my urine tested and she said it showed everything including glucose,\"I don't know what is meant by \"it showed everything\". However, when your body has excess blood sugar it is expelled through the kidneys via urine as a by product called Ketones. Too much Ketones can lead to one developing a potential life threatening condition called Ketoacidosis.\"But when my blood was tested abit later my glucose was normal.\"It would help to know what \"a bit later\" is. Was this after your urine test? Had you fasted 8-10 hrs prior to the test?\"Anyway I checked my BGluose with meter yesturday, it was after eating....my reading was 7.4\"Testing after eating is called postprandial. Postprandial test times is 2-3 hrs after a meal. Before this time does not provide a good insight as your blood sugar is still on the rise. Are you in the UK? If yes, the 7.4 mmol/l indicates 133.20 mg/dl, an acceptable postprandial levels IF you are diabetic. If not, it is high. Normal is between 3.33 - 5.55 mmol/l [60-99 mg/dl. Since you didn't tell us the category type of meter used [standard glucose or A1c], the 7.4 could imply an A1c of 7.4%, which is equivalent to a daily glucose average of 9.22 mmol/l [166 mg/dl]. The potatoes probably caused your blood sugar elevation. Potato's are a starch, starches are quickly digested and their sugars enter the blood stream rapidly. To a diabetic starches are a no-no.\"but should I be worried?\"Yes. As stated earlier, signs of Ketones can lead to serious health issues unless one does something to stop the flow. Now is the time to make lifestyle changes to avoid going down the wrong road. It would be in your best interest to get referred to an Endocrinologist [a doctor specializing in diabetes treatment and care] for follow-up testing. In the meantime educate yourself on how to prevent the onset of diabetes by maintaining proper body weight, daily exercise, maintaining and controlling your Lipid panel, and by eating the proper/correct/healthy foods. Good luck -",

            "answer": "From the U.S. National Library of Medicine,\u00a0\u00a0National Institutes of HealthUrine Glucose Test:Normal ResultsGlucose is not usually found in urine. If it is, further testing is needed.Normal glucose range in urine: 0 - 0.8 mmol/l (0 - 15 mg/dL)The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.What Abnormal Results MeanGreater than normal levels of glucose may occur with:- Diabetes, although blood glucose tests are needed to diagnose diabetes. Small increases in urine glucose levels after a large meal are not always a cause for concern.- A rare condition in which glucose is released from the kidneys into the urine, even when blood glucose levels are normal (renal glycosuria)- Pregnancy -- up to half of women will have glucose in their urine at some point during pregnancy. Glucose in the urine may mean that a woman has gestational diabetes.Glucose will only show up in the urine once it has reached high levels in the blood. As a result, a glucose urine test is not useful for helping a person monitor and control their diabetes.",

    "question": "So I went to the docs awhile ago about something, and had my urine tested and she said it showed everything including glucose, and i would have to be careful about my diet etc. But when my blood was tested abit later my glucose was normal. Im not overweight at all, I dont eat that much but i do have another autoimmune disease.Anyway I checked my BGluose with meter yesturday, it was after eating but I hadn't eaten much because i cooked some meat and then it was off so all I had was a couple of small potatoes and a bit of salad, and my reading was 7.4. I dont normally check it, but its never been that high before. I know its not that high, but should I be worried?thanks",
