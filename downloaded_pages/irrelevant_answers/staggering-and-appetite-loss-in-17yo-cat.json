    "question": "My 17 year old cat has always been a hearty eater.\u00a0\u00a0He had a hyperthyroid condition that we treated successfully with radioactive iodine a few years ago.\u00a0\u00a0Lately he hasn't eaten much and has gotten very thin, and he tends to stagger when he walks, like his back legs are weak.\u00a0\u00a0We went to the vet, who tested him for diabetes, hyperthyroidism and did general blood work that all came back negative.\u00a0\u00a0Since then, he has stopped eating entirely and spends most of his time sitting in his box facing the corner.\u00a0\u00a0Even when we tempt him with tuna he won't eat, although I gave him a couple slivers of beef last night and he scarfed it down.\u00a0\u00a0He still has some of his old habits: he goes into the kitchen sometimes when my husband does, as if he's going to beg food like he used to.\u00a0\u00a0He is very interested in our 4 month old and loves to lie on her mat.\u00a0\u00a0He even asks to go outside sometimes although he just lies in the sun.\u00a0\u00a0This morning my husband said his breathing sounded wet.\u00a0\u00a0His eyes have been running for some time now, and he's had bouts of throwing up and phlegm in his poop in the past year, which we treated with antibiotics.\u00a0\u00a0Now we're worried that he's going to get worse over the weekend when the vet is closed, and we don't want to watch him suffer.\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone offer any insight or advice?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks in advance.",
