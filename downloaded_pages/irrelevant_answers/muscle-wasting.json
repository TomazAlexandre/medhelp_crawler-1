            "answer": "First let me say, I feel your frustration and angst. Being I'll and not finding answers is very stressful, I have been there\u00a0\u00a0(along with so many others) so I feel for you. I have no medical back ground, so all I can really do is play the guessing game. How long ago was your husband diagnosed with arthritis?\u00a0\u00a0I don't know much about it so, is 600 a really high range? If he is in severe pain are the doctors able to prescribe pain meds to help with it? I can't see how his appetite would be good being in pain like that, has he been eating much? I am sure he must also be feeling depresses ( I would be) while waiting for a diagnosis, it may help to take a mild antidepressant med. This might help his appetite so he doesn't lose more weight. How long did it take to drop the 40 lbs? Have they checked his blood surgars ( Diabetes)?\u00a0\u00a0With Diabetes this sometimes happens when your sugars are way too high. I hope you get some answers soon, I will try to get some more ideas and post them. Try to stay possitive I know it's hard. Get as must rest as possible, you staying healthy is very important.",

            "answer": "Hi, having an ill family member can be so stressful. You need to take care of your husband but make sure you take care of yourself as well. I agree with doodles_mimi that your husband should be checked for diabetes. I think you should also have a thyroid panel done as well. One thing I know that helps this kind of pain is to get off simple sugars and white carbohydrates. Have your husband go on a low glycemic, high fiber diet and drink lots of water. Also start taking large doses of top grade fish oil supplements and 2000-3000 mg of vitamin c every day. Doing these things will help reduce the inflammation and pain. It may take a few weeks before you notice a difference.",

            "answer": "Have the doctors check his blood for the levels of medication in his system? My husband has been on lithium since 1980 .3 years ago he lost his appetite,lost 40 pounds,slept hours during the day and had memory issues.He appeared to have a stroke while driving one day.It turned out to be lithium toxicity.He had been on the same dose for years but as he aged,his system slowed down and his body was unable to process the drug as quickly so a lethal level built up.Today ,he is on a lower dose and is back to normal.Please,if your husband has been on the same meds for years,have his levels checked.Good luck",
