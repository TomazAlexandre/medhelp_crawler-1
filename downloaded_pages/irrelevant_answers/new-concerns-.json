    "question": "So I was recently told I have extra fluid around my twins. Dr will watch to see what happen. I also just failed my 1hr glucose test initial 88 and post 154. So now I have to do a 3hr test. I am already high risk with age, twins and previous losses and on bed rest. Hopefully three hour I will pass but I doubt it cause diabetes runs on both sides of my family. Baby continues to grow nicely. But with all the additional problems I'm sure they will be here early. Last night I also had the most intense vaginal pain and I am not sure where it came from almost like two kicks and a shooting pain but it was different than the baby's normal kick. I'm praying all goes well cause walking, turning, sleeping and getting out of bed is becoming a huge problem. Well we can only wait and see.",
