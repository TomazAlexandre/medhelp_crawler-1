            "answer": "1 day ago we adopted a 4 yr old femail min pin from a family who is moving and could not keep her. She (Squirt) is a darling and seems to be settling in. I thought that your advice about what to feed this small dog made a lot of sense and so I wonder if I could ask you about how to judge when such a small dog may have to go outside. It is very cold here right now with lots of snow on the ground. She has a sweater. Is it best for me to just keep taking her out or wait for her to signal me when she wants to go? Her former owners were very emotional about giving her up and were not very forthcoming about some details. I'd appreciate your opinion about the potty issue. Thank you.",
