            "answer": "I'm sorry you're having such a hard time. Your other problems, diabetes and thyroid do contribute to the difficulty. I have both, so just a couple thoughts even though it's a bit off topic. If your thyroid is low (hypo) it makes it extremely hard to lose weight. Are you on thyroid meds? Diabetes can tend to destabilize thyroid for those of us with both problems, so you need to be sure you are on the right dose of thyroid meds and have your TSH checked regularly. You don't say at all what diabetes meds you are on or how your blood sugar is, nor how you eat. You say you cut out all soda except one in the morning. If you mean sugar soda that is one too many. In order to keep your blood sugar stable you need to limit carbs. If you are on insulin you need to be careful not to \"feed the insulin\" (eat a lot of carbs than bolus higher doses of insulin to cover it). This will guarantee weight gain. I would suggest you see a nutritionist or diabetic educator to get more help in eating for both your diabetes and weight loss because they are very much connected.As for throwing up. Unfortunately eating disorders are all too common with people with diabetes, especially young women. And they are very dangerous! Keeping our blood sugar stable is impossible when we fast, starve outselves, binge, or purge (vomit or use laxatives). You put your health in serious jeopardy, much more so than somebody without diabetes. Having said that, I know it isn't easy to get over an eating disorder because I struggled with one for 30 years. I now have 15 years recovery for which I'm really grateful. I wasn't diagnosed with diabetes until after I had been in recovery. I would suggest your getting help. Ask your doctor about a therapist trained in eating disorders. You can also go to meetings of OA, which you can find in all large towns.Start by making sure your thyroid level is ok, then work on replacing your vomiting with healthy eating. Those things have to happen first before you can focus on weight loss. Best of luck to you and let us know how you do.",

            "answer": "Hello,Yeah, the thyroid and diabetes issues will slow you down.\u00a0\u00a0It'll take a while, but the weight will shift.\u00a0\u00a0There are some techniques you can try.Eat unrefined foods as much as possible, and cook at home rather than buy processed food.\u00a0\u00a0The unrefined foods will make you feel more full after you eat, since they will have more fibre than other foods.\u00a0\u00a0They are also more dense in nutrition, so after a couple of days your body will know that it is being fed properly and will stop sending you 'hungry' signals.Eat small portions throughout the day, every couple of hours or so.\u00a0\u00a0This will stop your body panicking that it will starve.\u00a0\u00a0When you body is afraid of starving, it saves every little bit of energy it can get and refuses to shift the energy (excess weight) that it has already stored.\u00a0\u00a0After a month or two of eating small amounts regularly, it will relax and your metabolism will speed up.There is a really good website called nutrion data.\u00a0\u00a0It will allow you to track all you eat every day and analyse the nutrients you've taken in.\u00a0\u00a0You can look up one food at a time, and also look at your diet overall.\u00a0\u00a0You'll get a sense of nutritionally dense foods after a while.Protein is a good nutrient to emphasise in your diet, because it makes your body feel more full for longer.\u00a0\u00a0However, don't go Atkin's crazy with it, just if you need a snack and have a choice between protein and carbs, take the protein 2 outta 3 times.\u00a0\u00a0To reduce your appetite and increase the quality of your nutritional intake, try Spirulina tablets about 1/2 hour before meals.\u00a0\u00a0Spirulina is a micro-algae which is full of easily assimilated proteins and many vitamins and minerals.Did you know that when you throw up, at least one third of what you ate will stay in your digestive system?\u00a0\u00a0So, it is better to eat a healthy, whole-food meal and keep it down, rather than a so-so or unhealthy meal and throw it up.You're also risking your dental health by throwing up, because the stomach acid will erode your back teeth if you keep up the habit.It might help you to speak to your doctor about the throwing up, because a) you might need some support overcoming the practice, and b) usually with eating/body image issues, it isn't only the weight that is the problem.\u00a0\u00a0You might need some guidance on increasing your self-esteem and sense of worth.\u00a0\u00a0Whether you're overweight or not, chances are you have a lot to offer, and you're own unique qualities that make you special and valuable.\u00a0\u00a0Find out what these things are, judge yourself before letting anyone else's opinions anywhere near your heart, and find a way to accept yourself as you are.\u00a0\u00a0It's funny, but once you accept yourself, warts n all, it tends to be easier to change!Strive for health and balance, and the weight loss will happen!\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
