            "answer": "Hi thanks for your interesting reply.I have been tested for diabetes. That was negative.I meant that my (HR) Heart Rate increases after eating and I feel discomfort. It sometimes it goes to 120-130 (its 50-60 resting). I rarely go out after eating a meal, and before exercising I will make sure I have not eaten anything for a good few hours.I actually saw a cardiologist today, who is going to re-do my 24hr blood pressure and also a 24hr tape (whatever that is). As I've not got a clue about these things I have always thought it might be an enzyme or hormone or a mineral that's causing me problems. I just don't feel well and the prickling in my face and scalp is getting worse, with slight vertigo. I'm active, not depressed or anxious and my own GP is very dismissive. I also took lansoprazole for acid indigestion 20 years and now I don't need that either. It would be great if I didn't have these blasted symptoms.thanks",

            "answer": "I've heard that one can experience some weird symptoms after being on meds for HBP then stopping them.My mother had hypertension for 30 years, then suddenly it went away.\u00a0\u00a0The human body is a complicated machine.My only advice to you would be: 1. don't eat large meals.\u00a0\u00a0It is so much easier on your physiology to eat several small meals a day.\u00a0\u00a0 Eating a large meal, especially one high in carbs, causes you to produce boatloads of insulin, which can cause all kinds of strange sensations.\u00a0\u00a0 Also, your body rushes blood to your digestive tract, sometimes causing some folks to feel faint.I had a friend who would often pass out after a large meal.\u00a0\u00a0Since switching to smaller meals more frequently, this stopped.Also, why would you stay with a doctor who is \"very dismissive?\"\u00a0\u00a0 Screw that!\u00a0\u00a0(Excuse my language.)\u00a0\u00a0 If I were you, I'd find another doctor.\u00a0\u00a0 Any physician who ignores your concerns deserves to be FIRED.You only get one body...take good care of it.\u00a0\u00a0And that includes finding a practitioner who is respectful and listens to you.\u00a0\u00a0 Trust me, there are lots and lots of really crappy docs out there.Good luck,-Robin",

    "question": "Hi,I'm 53, male, not overweight. I was diagnosed with HBP when I was 28. Originally treated with atenelol, until change of doctor switched me to 30mg Coracten and 20mg lisinopril (13 years ago).I found the combo effective, regular monitoring showed BP controlled, no side effects.about 16 months ago I noticed I was getting dizzy, standing up, and dizzy after exercise. I stopped the coracten. Doc confirmed BP ok without coracten. However, dizziness continued and I stopped half of the lisinopril, then stopped another quarter, then completely. Monitored my own BP, went to doc who confirmed ok. Typical reading sitting now was 117/76. Needless to say I was delighted and amazed.However, my troubles seemed only to be starting. I continued to be slightly lightheaded after exercise, and a feeling of pins and needles in my scalp and upper face started. I thought it may have been from my neck. I travel a lot and had an episode of confusion, dizziness / vertigo at a hotel after a large meal. I had an urge to eat sweet stuff, which relieved some of my symptoms at the time (since been tested for reactive hypoglycemia -negative, although I think blood sugar was involved on a coupe of occasions). Due to ongoing 'out of it' feeling and worsening prickling on face and in eyes I spent months off work.I was put on a 24hr BP cuff which came back as an average 'normal'.I dont really understand how my high BP of 25 years dissapeared within a matter of months, and is it a coincidence\u00a0\u00a0that my new symptoms almost coincided with the last doses of lisinopril. I have been to a neurologist who has mentioned dysesthsia, and has done a MRI of my head (still await results).I feel that the 'out of it feeling' is worse and the prickling, almost numbness, (like a dentist anesthetic wearing off) in my scalp and face is worse.I don't think I'm going to keel over, but I just cant understand the chain of events.My only note would be that my HR after eating goes a bit wild and I have the urge to lie/sit down.Standing without eating my systolic can now be low 100's, yet the diastolic seems stable at about 80. Normal limits I suppose.I just feel weird. I exercise regularly. My doc thinks\u00a0\u00a0'your fine', but I don't feel it and I am neither anxious or depressed.Can high blood pressure resolve like this ?Could my BP medication have caused some kind of permanent withdrawal and cause my symptoms ?The neurologist has recommended duloxotine, which I was hoping to avoid but I don't seem to be getting anywhere. :(Thanks for reading",
