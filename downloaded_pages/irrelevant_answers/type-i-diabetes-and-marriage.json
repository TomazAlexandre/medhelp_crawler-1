            "answer": "Hello, Mary.\u00a0\u00a0Of course people with diabetes can get married.\u00a0\u00a0Having diabetes is not a reason to avoid marriage.\u00a0\u00a0People with diabetes these days are doing much better with diabetes management, and the rate of complications in people who are using these management principles are dropping drammatically.\u00a0\u00a020 years ago, this wasn't the case, so the patients that your dad sees fall into that group, where they didn't have the tools and the knowledge that we have today.\u00a0\u00a0I'd have your significant other show that he can and does manage his diabetes well.\u00a0\u00a0Your parents need to understand that times have changed with respect to diabetes care, and there is no reason to break up with someone simply because of diabetes.",

            "answer": "Mary,I have been a diabetic since I was 14.\u00a0\u00a0I am now 49.I am very active and have no diabetic problems, but I do take care of myself.I was diagnosed with diabetic retnepothy when I was 28 and according to my eye Dr. at last months visit it has not progressed since I was first in his office 21 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0In fact he told me he would be dead before I needed lasar on my eyes.Your parents are wrong.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetics can have a very long and fulfilling life, but as with anyone healthy or not things can happen to us in our life that will shorten it, that is the chance you will have to take with anyone, diabetic or not.Diabeties can be taken care of with the proper meds, diet and exorcise.Bob",

            "answer": "Just a thought--do your parents like this boy?\u00a0\u00a0Maybe there are other reasons for their dislike of this boy, because I guess I find it hard to believe someone would make you break up simply because they have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0In fact someone as knowledgeable as your father would know that diabetes management has progressed as above mentioned.And are these patients your father sees Type 2 diabetics? Type 1 diabetes is when the pancreas does not produce insulin. Type 2 diabetes is most often diagnosed in people who are overweight, do not exercise and have a history of neglecting the needs of their bodies.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore Type 2 diabetics still produce insulin but their bodies do not use the insulin sufficiently or I could say properly.Anyway, why don't you try talking to your parents, maybe there was some miscommunication.",

Good luck with your situation.\u00a0\u00a0I hope everything works out for the best.",

And it's great (which has nothing to do with diabetes).I think that you parents are having some other issue, either with him or with the idea of you growing up.

He may even be a lot healthier because a lot of people with diabetes take better care of themselves than other people!Don't base your relationship decisions on diabetes! We are normal people :)",

I know he has been struggling with his diabates, but I have recently found out that he has found the comfort in an unmarried female co-worker, I have found that they have been talking for quite some time and talk numerous times per day and at very late hours. And this has been going on for at least 5 monthsTo me this is cheating and lying and hurts very much. But at the same time I know that he needs support from other people.I am just soo lost and hurt and just wanted someone else who may know how to react to this.",

In fact, I have not been sick, not even had a cold, for over 4 years. I'm active and have worked nearly all my adult life. I have 3 grown-up sons who are all very healthy and wonderful people. I do take care of myself, checking my blood sugar numerous times and taking multiple shots each day. I am lucky to have a great husband who is caring and supportive. Diabetes treatment has come a long way and as long as your boyfriend educates himself about diabetes and takes care of himself, he will almost certainly live a long and healthy life. Because we diabetics MUST eat well and not overdo anything (booze, food, etc.) most Type 1s are actually healthier than a lot of the general population who take their health for granted, don't exercise, and eat too much junk food. Don't listen to your dad on this one, he's actually uninformed and ignorant of how well most Type 1s can do nowadays!",

My parents are forcing me to break up with a diabetic because he is not \"marriage material\".. apparently diabetics who have had diabetes for a long time (this boy has had it since 17) begin complications really early.. my dad is an eye doctor and he says that he gets patients with diabetic complications in their eyes every single day, and that they get blind by their 40s if they even last that long.. not to mention all these other long-term complications... gangrenes, amputations, strokes, etc etc... are my parents being overprotective or do they have a point?",
