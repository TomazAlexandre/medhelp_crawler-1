            "answer": "You would normally get induced by 41 weeks, but it depends on your Dr and what's going on with the baby. Some women get induced because of medical concerns, which can happen anytime and vary. I agree with you that inducing early for no reason other than being impatient is wrong, but do know that many have legitimate reasons for needing to.",

I had some elevated protein levels; which was an indication of spina bifida, club foot, down syndrome, and etc. Once that was ruled out my Dr wanted to induce to make sure my son was born healthy. He was!",

            "answer": "I personally won't consider being induced until I'm a week late unless it's for medical reasons. Even then, might wait until 2 weeks! I think most people just get impatient and want the baby here because pregnancy is difficult, but how I see it that's the sacrifice we make to help our children be healthy. I think also we forget it our due dates are estimates, and it's completely normal and common to go past it! To each their own though, everyone's situations and pregnancies are different. Maybe with my next I'll be misserable and asking them to take the baby early haha. Right now I'm 39 weeks and content with whenever he comes. I'm prepared for him now, but enjoying the time my husband and I have just us.",

My second was induced at 40+2 and he was bigger than my first and tore me. My 3rd & 4th were induced at 39w and were also bigger than my first 2.
