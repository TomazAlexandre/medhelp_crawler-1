            "answer": "If i had to guess I would think you have something else, which I have. It is called hidradenitis suppurativa and I have had it since I was 18 and finally got a diagnosis about 2 years ago at the age of 40. I saw a dermatologist and the surgery to remove them would be way too extensive so he was injecting them with a corticosteroid and it was helping. I now am injecting them myself and have had a good degree of success. (He lets me inject them myself as I am a registered nurse and i t saves me time to just do it in my own.) Do a search on this condition as it is extremely underdiagnosed and can go on for a long time with no results if not treated properly. I too had the first one surgically removed at 18 and suffered for many years before finding answers. If I can help in any way just drop me a line and will try to respond.",

            "answer": "Hello,It is strange that even after surgical removal the abscess has came back. It means that it can be a cyst and the entire contents of the cyst have not been taken out. Consult your dermatologist and discuss this with him. Recurrent boils/abscess are found in diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune system disorders. So please get your blood sugar evaluatedHope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
