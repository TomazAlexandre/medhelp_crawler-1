            "answer": "Hi DeeYou mentioned that you spoke to the doctor. Was it your liver doctor or a doctor that specializes in treating patients with diabetes?I do not know anything about diabetes or Metformin. What I do know is since your liver is cirrhotic, it is very important that you protect it. Your\u00a0\u00a0description of how this medicine is affecting you shows that your body is not happy with this medicine. Every person is different. What may be fine for one patient may not not be fine for you. Listen to your body.Perhaps you can fine some good advice on the Diabetes Community. If you have not seen a doctor specializing in diabetes than you should. If you did and he/she is the one who prescribed this medicine, I would check with the liver specialist. You can also call the manufacturer's medical help line.Good luck, Dee!Nan",

            "answer": "Hi Nan, thanks so much for answering.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor I was talking about was my GP, not really confident that she knows enough about the liver.\u00a0\u00a0She said I would get used to feeling sick.\u00a0\u00a0It was not happening.\u00a0\u00a0I started to think that my body was just not working with it when my heart started to beat rapidly and I felt out of breath.The literature about Metformin says you should not take if you have liver or kidney problems.Perhaps I can talk to my hepatologist about this problem.I think something is going on, it doesn't seem to agree with my body.Thank you again for your response, I have decided to try diet to control the blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Since I stopped the Metformin a few days ago I am feeling better than I have in weeks.Take CareDee",

            "answer": "Hi Dee! My sister developed diabetes a few years ago and was put on metformin. She has no liver problems but it did give her huge digestive problems for the first two-three months. After that her body adjusted to it and she felt fine for over a year. Then her blood tests came out bad in a totally different way. It turns out she is one of the fairly small percentage of people who develop serious kidney problems from metformin. She had to stop it completely. Over the time she used it however she was also being extremely careful with her diet and lost a LOT of weight, so her diabetes is not so out of control anymore. Now she uses a once-per-week injection of Bydureon, and her diabetes is very well-controlled. Initially she used a helper drug with it, Glipizide ER, but she no longer needs that. She doesn't have any noticeable side effects from these meds and has kept her weight down pretty easily as the Bydureon reduces appetite as well as controlling the diabetes. You might want to ask your doctor about these drugs as an alternative. I think different people have problems with different meds but its important to keep trying different alternatives until you hit what works for you. Good luck!",
