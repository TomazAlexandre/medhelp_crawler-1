(Ketones can also be present if one is starved or vomitting). The odor could be because of dehydration (although she is drinking alot) or because of infection.",

    "question": "Ok, so I asked about my 2 yr old on here earlier. I had one other question though. I am not at all familiar with diabetes. All I know it that my grandpa had it bad and so lately when my daughter started drinking tons of fluids throughout the day as if she was always thirsty and acting tired, well my Mother began to quesiton diabetes. Can a strong smell of urine be a sign of diabetes? She ALWAYS has a very strong smell/odor and has told me many of times that it hurts down there, but we had the doctor run tests on her for a UTI or Bladder Infection and all came back negative/normal. So I was wondering if there was any relation to that? Anyone out there have a child with diabetes?",
