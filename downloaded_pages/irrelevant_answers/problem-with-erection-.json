            "answer": "Hello,Stress is an important cause of erectile dysfunction. Causes may be psychological, smoking, alcohol, illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, spinal cord and neurological causes.To exactly pinpoint a diagnosis you need to get a complete examination done from a urologist. In your case it looks more psychological. Sildenafil is the drug of choice for erectile dysfunction. However it is available only on a doctor's prescription.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Dear Doctor, thank you for your response. I recently visited a medical practitioner, and he suggested me to undergo a few tests like FSH, LH, serum testosterone (total and free), etc. Even I think it can be due to psychological problems. I have started feeling much better after visiting the doctor.Thanks for your interest in my condition.",

    "question": "Dear Doctor,I am a 27 year old slightly overweight male. I have been having difficulty in getting and maintaining erection for the past 4-5 months. It started with losing erection during intercourse, but now I cannot even sustain for more than a few seconds. Sexual gratification is also not helping since I find it difficult to achieve erection. When I was in a steady relationship two years ago, I never had this problem. I would also like to let you know that I have been under tremendous mental stress since last year due to break up, failure in academics and job loss. And now, with this new problem, I feel that I have started giving up in life. Also, I have noticed that my urethra and the tip of the penis itches after ejaculation and a strong urge to urinate develops. Please help. Thanks.",
