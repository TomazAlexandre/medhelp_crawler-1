            "answer": "I assume you've been to skin specialist (dermatologist)? If not, see one, and if the first doesn't know, see another. Sometimes a diagnosis is complex (multi-layered conditions) and 2-3 heads are often better than one.Meanwhile, here's an excellent web site with lots of pictures and the accompanying skin conditions. Just keep in mind that many skin conditions are very similar and that's where an experienced dermatologist comes in.Anyway, there's a search box -- upper right -- and just start entering in different search schemes such as \"rash\" or \"rash ankles\" or \"rash joint pain\" etc,Good luck and hope you feel better soon.-- Jim",

            "answer": "Do you have any blood sugar problems and/or diabetes??\u00a0\u00a0 I ask this because it seems sort of similar to something my sister gets and she has diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0She's also had some problems with retaining fluid, do you get that?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It may, or may not be related to the Hep.\u00a0\u00a0Like Jim said, there's lot's of similar skin conditions.\u00a0\u00a0I had a big problem with the itching even when I was off of treatment.\u00a0\u00a0I assumed it was the Hep C or that it had been brought on by my treatments.\u00a0\u00a0But, when it was still itching after being off of treatment for 8 mon., I went to my dermatologist.\u00a0\u00a0She did a skin biopsy and it came back with an uncommon skin condition.\u00a0\u00a0Certain triggers will bring a flare up for me.\u00a0\u00a0Sun is a big one that brings it out.\u00a0\u00a0Which unfortunately, makes me mad because living in FL, during the summer, people are always wanting to do some sort of swim-beach-pool activities, which I can't do, or I itch....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The weird thing was, off of treatment, I don't get a rash w/it, just the itching.\u00a0\u00a0Another trigger for me is hot showers.\u00a0\u00a0So, now, every shower is a 'cold' shower.\u00a0\u00a0Not fun in the winter time when you're cold to start with.\u00a0\u00a0But, when I bring up the water temp, it makes me itch.\u00a0\u00a0So, that rules out hot tubs.\u00a0\u00a0Then, another trigger that the dermatologist told me about is getting too hot when I exercise.\u00a0\u00a0She said that if I get hot during exercise to cool down right away afterwards.\u00a0\u00a0She gave me an Epi-pen to keep on hand in case I get a bug bite and have a systemic reaction.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, what you have, may be, an entirely different thing.\u00a0\u00a0Many skin conditions can be cleared up right away with the proper diagnosis and treatments.\u00a0\u00a0Go see your doctor, okay???Susan",
