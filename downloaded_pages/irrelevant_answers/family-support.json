            "answer": "I am very lucky in that my family understands migraines and supports me a lot. My parents let me live with them because of my medical condition even, which is sometimes depressing that I'm an adult and I had to move back in with my parents but it is also amazing that they let me do that and I am really so lucky and I know that. They also go to my neurologist appointments and even my GP appointments with me if I ask them to, but they also let me go alone if I say that is what I want because I am 26 after all... so, they are just supportive when I ask for it and need it.",

            "answer": "I'm really lucky with my mom and sister. Mom lets me live with her, even tho I'm 21, and she takes me to all of my appointments because I can't drive. She's open to trying new things if I think that it will help my migraines. She also is willing to just be there for me, let me cry on her, or play cards and be distracted by her. My sister no longer lives with us, but she's still a huge help. Last night when I was in the ER for the 3rd time this weekend, she brought us dinner as we'd been there for 6 hours already.My father, on the other hand, is totally UNsupportive. He asked me once why I wasn't embarrassed by my migraines, which totally blew me out of the water. I had no idea how I could be embarrassed by something that wasn't my fault. He also firmly believes that if I can sit upright and smile, then I'm not in pain, when, in truth, I've had a constant migraine since Sept. '01.So it's split, but I focus on my mom and sister.",

            "answer": "i wasent supported with my migraines at all for years. i went to doctor after doctor with no dx or help. my hubby thought i was acting so he would leave me alone. i even had a pituitary tumor removed and sent home med free!! it was when i went to a migraine spealist and was dx with chronic daily migraines / ice-pick and cluster migraines that i got support. i would be in so much pain i would sit in the dark and vomit and lost my vision for a min and passed out that scared my family. i thank god i found my spealist my hubby understands and supports me. i do have fewer migraines and all the support i need now. dame_wilbur im sorry your dad doesent understand. i do know how that feels and i have tryed to hide my pain to be left alone.",

            "answer": "I am so glad to hear that your husband came around and understands and supports you now. Was it because your headache specialist explained migraines to him that he started to understand? Or was it just you going to the headache specialist that made him realize it was serious? I wonder if that's why maybe other people's families are sometimes not supportive, if it's just because maybe they don't understand how serious migraines are? Anyway... I am glad that you have the support you need now... at the Chronic Pain Clinic I go to, in the waiting room people are always talking about how their family doesn't support them, and it's always so sad to hear... but, your story is uplifting because even though you didn't have support at first, now you do. It's good to know that sometimes non-supportive situations can change into supportive situations.",
