            "answer": "Hi,I do need to know your height to see if this weight loss is not good. You should also be sure to ask your doctor to check for other causes of weight loss(e.g thyroid disease) and for glucose in your urine. My guess is that you are losing weight because you are urinating all your glucose out. Once your blood sugars become normal, that will stop and your weight will stabilize(if not increase). please speak to your doctor about this soon.Take care",
