            "answer": "Dear birdiegolf,i'm no doctor but i've never heard of diabetic neuropathy reacting like anxiety. You may want to check up with a neurologist to see what he has to say.\u00a0\u00a0There could be many more things than diabetes related things going on. Why do you react so stressfully to your job? No matter what kind of job i've had in my sordid past i've always tried to relax and just do my best and if my best isn't good enough that it must be time to change. Though i must admit sometimes it is hard to not get nerved up over your current work requirements. Good luck in your search, bret",

            "answer": "If it's possible, check your BG when you have these feelings.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the symptoms of low BG can be similar to anxiety feelings.I share BL's view that what you describe doesn't sound like neuropathy symptoms I've read or heard about.\u00a0\u00a0With reasonable (not perfect) control, it would be unusual for a Type 1 to develop neuropathy so quickly, too.I also not a physician, but I do believe that we humans, diabetic or not, will eventually develop physical problems from unresolved, chronic stress.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes, its management & fears of complications are fairly potent stressors even if everything else in our lives is 100% perfect ;-).\u00a0\u00a0If a person endures stress for weeks or months on end & has no safe outlets for relief, my \"gut\" tells me that the person will internalize it and end up with all sorts medical problems.If chronic stress is a factor for you, look for physical activities to help release some of it; yoga & meditation to let go of some it; counseling to help deal with some of it.Good luck.",

            "answer": "I am having the same thing happening.\u00a0\u00a0It started a few months ago, I sometimes wonder if it is Lantus contributing.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone else taking Lantus and having similar problems?My blood glucose is fine, but I'm shaking - it scares my family. (They are used to low glucose, this is different).",

    "question": "I have type 1 dibetes and have had it for 4 years.\u00a0\u00a0I am 27 years old and keep pretty good track of my blood sugar levels although I am not perfect.My question is this.\u00a0\u00a0During stressful situations on my job, I have found myself getting what I would call anxiety symptoms more than I used to, shaky, nervous and what feels like a rapid heart beat.\u00a0\u00a0My job is stressful at times but this feels like more anxiety than it used to.\u00a0\u00a0Just wondering if it is my nerves feeling the stress possibly neuroapathy.Any comments would be appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
