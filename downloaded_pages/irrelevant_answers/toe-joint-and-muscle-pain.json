    "question": "The muscles in my toes and where it connects to the rest of my foot have been very painful. When I stretch those toes or bend them back to help ease the tension, it hurts a lot. It's just an extremely sore muscle-type pain, not shooting or particularly sharp, but it does hurt enough to make me want to limp at times. At first I thought it was due to a particular type of boot I was wearing, but the pain has remained since I've stopped wearing them. I also don't remember any specific event that could have caused them to be injured.I walk up 3 flights of stairs multiple times of day, if that makes any difference, but ever since it's started hurting, I've been wearing tennis shoes and anything without a heel.Any ideas if it's just natural foot pain, or is there a real condition for it, or what?",
