            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Hemorrhagic stroke is caused by bleeding into the brain. Clots in the arms could be a part of peripheral artery disease and this will not cause strokes. It can cause a pain in the arm, make the arm turn bluish but will usually not cause any neurological problem. Hence these are two different things. Peripheral artery disease is caused by diabetes, high platelet count, clotting disorders, hypothyroidism, high cholesterol etc.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
