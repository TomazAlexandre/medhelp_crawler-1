            "answer": "bhk6,I really can't specifically comment not knowing the details, including seeing his catheterization.I think any time you are told that 'thats just the way it is' you should seek a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Preferably at a tertiary referral center. There are other options for refractory angina without options for revascularization such as eecp. It would be reasonable to explore these options.good luck",

    "question": "My husband had a quad bypass 12/98 at age 63. He was obese and a heavy smoker. Since then he has quit smoking, but is still 20 lbs overweight. He has type 2 Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0May 24, 2005, he had a heart cath done due to continuing mild chest pain.It showed blocked in one of the \"branches\" off a new artery.Decided to stent next day, but the blockage was GONE. Dr. says maybe \"spasms\".Put on nitropatch for one week, then removed and treating with nitroquick as needed for 2 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0BP has been running low, under 102/60 most days.\u00a0\u00a0BP meds are lopressr 25 mg and vasotec 2.5, one in a.m. other p.m.\u00a0\u00a0Thus feels exhausted most of the time. Other meds: metformin, lexapro, wellbutrin sr, simvistatin. synthroid, low dose aspirin.The pain usually occurs while sitting/reclining, though sometimes on morning walk of less than 1 mile.Your website indicates no cure for this.....(?)and his cardiol. says nothing to prevent it......something patient just has to live with.....ARe there other ways to treat this condition? Does it warrant a second opinion or is it fairly common for male age 70?Thank you for help.",
