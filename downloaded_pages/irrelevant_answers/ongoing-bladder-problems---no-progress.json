            "answer": "Hey Steve!1. No it is not necessary for the surgeon to have checked for cancer when doing BNI while primary tests done before arriving at the probable cause are likely to have ruled out cancer as well.2. A BC may show up on the CT while a cystoscopy may be required in a few cases.3. Well, without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include adhesions, hormonal/ endocrine causes such as diabetes, GU infections/ inflammations, trauma/ ulcers, erosions, neuro-muscular causes, growths/ masses etc.With recurrent symptoms, I would suggest considering a review with your treating urologist for a detailed evaluation. After a specific cause is identified, it can be managed accordingly.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "I have had ongoing problems now for over 1 year.Initial symptoms of passing urine frequently getting up at night etc led to me having CT Scan of bladder and Kidneys, Flow rate test and ultrasound in May last year followed by a bladder neck incision.After some improvement I am now experiencing over the last 6 months frequent urination ( 2 or 3 times an hour) constant burning in penis, and a feeling of tenderness / fullness around pubic area. I also have flank pain constantly.I am concerned I may have bladder cancer ( although 5 urine tests over last year have been clear).My question is1) would the surgeon have checked for bladder cancer when doing a BNI ?2) would BC show on CT / Ultrasound scan3) any ideas as to what issue could beI have had Cipro etc several times to no effect and am at my wits end as to what to doThanksSteve",
