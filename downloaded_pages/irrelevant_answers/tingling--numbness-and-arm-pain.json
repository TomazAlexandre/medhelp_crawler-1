            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is important to rule out peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes and B12 deficiency as it can cause symptoms of tingling numbness.Other causes that need to be excluded are nerve compression in the neck, carpal tunnel syndrome and cubital tunnel syndrome.Please consult an experienced neurologist. Take care!",

    "question": "I am 43, female, with three boys aged 20, 15 and 13. For past two years I have been experiencing tingling and occassional numbness, especially during air travel. I have had numerous check ups, with couple of doctors concluding that it is MS whereas others would disagree. Last checkup was done in London, UK, where a specialist doctor discounted MS and suggested that even if there is a remote possibility of MS it does not need any treatment at this stage.I continue to have the tingling, numbness and sometimes severe pain in my right arm. My question is if it is not MS then what could it be and what specialist do I need to refer to get rid of these problem.",
