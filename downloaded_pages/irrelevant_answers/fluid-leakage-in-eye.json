They found occasional ectopic beats and an average heartbeat of 75.\u00a0\u00a0I've also had stress tests on a machine and was found to have a good heart ejection fraction.The opthalmologist said he was looking at the back of my eyeball and put a dye in to dilate my pupils. He also put a yellow dye in and checked my eye pressure in both eyes which was 17.Thanks for taking time to answer.It has been a big worry to me as I've read it can lead to blindness.",

My left eye has the same white blind spot,and got worst after the laser was done( to stop the leak). My eye doc told me that however,the demage from the fluid and the laser left me a big scar in side that is inreversible, and that for now one i will need monitoring my vision constantly to make sure don't get worst. I wish you luck and don't do nothing before you get second and third opinion.",

    "question": "I'm a 53 yr old female in general good health last Saturday when I got up I noticed what was like a small transparent, white mark in my field of vision in my left eye. It was like looking through a fingermark on a window pane. I was referred to A&E and then next day to an eye specialist. He put numerous dyes in my eyes and then said that I had a small fluid leak into my eye. He said the number one cause was diabetes. He asked me if I was. I know that I'm not but all the same they tested and found out I wasn't. They also checked my blood pressure which was fine (though slightly raised due to the anxiety) They now want to run some more tests on me generally in a weeks time to try to find the cause. Naturally I'm worried it may continue to leak and also at a loss at to what may have been the cause. From what I'm read it may be caused by eye infections but I've had none. Can anyone help?",
