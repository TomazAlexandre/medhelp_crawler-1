            "answer": "Hello,Since you take alcohol,hence it is one of the most important possibilities for this numbness.Numness of feet or toes is very common in alcoholics.Other possibilities are injury to the back or spinal cord, lack of blood supply to the legs as a result of plaque formation in the blood vessels, diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis and underactive thyroid. Abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body and a lack of vitamin B12 can also cause numness in the feet.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the numbness is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Common disorders causing such symptoms are rheumatoid arthritis and tarsal tunnel syndrome,transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",

    "question": "Can anyone suggest if this is a major problem or not but in the mornings when I wake and go to stand up as soon as my feet touch the ground it's like they are numb and I have to step softly and then by a few steps it will disappear, but what is truly annoying is that when I drink Alcohol my two next to my pinky toe will go numb for some days and then it will just stop it doesn't turn blue or anything it just so happens that I feel it but it feels as if it is not really there which is very strange.",
