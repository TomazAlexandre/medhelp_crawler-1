    "question": "Hi all - Ive just been diagnosed with PCOS (Insulin resistance etc...) and have been prescribed Metformin 500mg 2x daily. I am awaiting AF so I can start taking it. The gyno/obst said I may as well wait till af incase I am PG. The trouble is I am soooooooo impatient and keen to get this babytrain started but AF is nearly 1-2weeks late and doesnt feel like she is coming. I did a hpt a week ago and it was neg. Do you think it would be safe to start taking the met now rather than wait?\u00a0\u00a0I have irregular periods. Last year they lasted for a month 3 or so times a year and this year Ive had them sometime throughout each calender month. Im scared Ill have to wait a month or 2 before I get af again... ANy ideas.Lorri. xx SSBD to all!!",
