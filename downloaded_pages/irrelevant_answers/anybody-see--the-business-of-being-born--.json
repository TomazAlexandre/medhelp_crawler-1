            "answer": "Loved this documentary! I wish I had seen it before I had my daughter 6 years ago. I had a c section with her from fetal distress because, I believe, I chose to be induced instead of letting nature take its course. I am now 34 wks with baby #2 and am trying my hardest to attempt a Vbac but since I have gestational diabetes this time around my Dr wont let me go the full 40 wks....fingers crossed I have this baby naturally by the end of the month",

            "answer": "Love the documentary. There is another one out \"More Business of Being Born\"I had a midwife birth and no OB had to intervene. I had one visit with a OB and never saw her again. Stuck with my midwife. OBs are trained for medical births and midwives are trained in natural births. Two pretty different worlds. Both have their place. Both are needed.You have to do what you are comfortable with. The documentary is good education for women that only listen to their doctors.",
