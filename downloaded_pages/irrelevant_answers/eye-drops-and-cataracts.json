            "answer": "Cataracts can cause variable vision but to vary as much as you note is unusual. Other considerations in the eye would be corneal disease (due to more edema or swelling in the AM) however the exam should have showed this.Anytime there is marked variable vision the immediate thought is undiagnosed or uncontrolled diabetes. If you have diabetes in your family or you have other risk factors: obesity, on steroids, symptoms of increased thirst, urination, unexplained weight loss you might ask your FP or GP to order appropriate tests to rule it out and also have your blood pressure checked.JCH MD",
