            "answer": "Hi there,It may be difficult to determine the exact cause of this discharge and spotting without a clinical examination and check up. There are very high chances that you can conceive since you have lost weight and are on medications. Metformin is a diabetes medicine used for lowering insulin and blood sugar levels in women with PCOD. This helps regulate menstrual cycles, start ovulation, and lower the risk of miscarriage in women with PCOS.Cramping about eight to ten days after ovulation can actually be a sign that you are pregnant. These pains are called implantation cramps. To confirm the status of pregnancy I would suggest you to get your serum HCG levels estimated since this is more specific than urine pregnancy tests. For best results it has been recommended to wait till a woman has missed her period or at least 14 days past ovulation. Consult a doctor.Best luck and regards!",
