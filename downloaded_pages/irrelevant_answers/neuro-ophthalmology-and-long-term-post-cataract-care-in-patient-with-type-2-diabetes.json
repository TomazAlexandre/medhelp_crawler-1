It sounds like you would be treated better and happier in a different clinic.I don't know what to make of that statement as ALL cataract operations all over the world even third world countries have intra ocular lens (lens replacements) put in the eye.See an ophthalmologist elsewhere.If in the USA find one at www.aao.orgJCH MD",

    "question": "I was born 09/29/1932.\u00a0\u00a0Immediately following cataract surgery (2000), I was told I would that lenses were inserted during the surgery and I no longer need to wear glasses. Then, to no avail, glasses were prescribed for double vision, which persisted. On attempt two (3?), my double vision was corrected with prisms in both lenses. As is my custom, I continue with annual eye exams, usually resulting in new lenses. Now, for 'floaters,'\u00a0\u00a0I see Dr. Riffai, diabetic-specialist ophthalmologist. On 9/10/08, he informed me that \"following cataract surgery, patients do not need lens replacements.\" Because my 'good' (stronger) right eye was hurting, I balked when referred to an optometrist, \"With all due respect, it has been many years (1972) since I knowingly made an appointment with an optometrist.\"\u00a0\u00a0\"But, ma'am, last year you saw our Dr. (optometrist)...\"\u00a0\u00a0my response, \"I repeat, 'With all due respect, it has been many years since I knowingly made an appointment with an optometrist.\"\u00a0\u00a0Eventually I was referred to their in-house neuro-ophthalmologist for an appointment.\u00a0\u00a0 QUESTION: Am I being unreasonable? Would I be as well off to see the optometrist to check for needed lens prescription?",
