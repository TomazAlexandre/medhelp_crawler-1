            "answer": "I would ask the doctor if they did any blood glucose tests. By looking at the lab papers, you may not know if they did this, for the paperwork would be in very technical language. If they did NOT do blood glucose tests, and if you do have abnormal thirst and fatigue, by all means specifically ask them to do a blood glucose test. Everything else can indeed be very normal but blood glucose levels be high, so if the other tests are normal it doesn't mean that you necessarily are not a diabetic.I hope, though, that one of the tests that was run did get a glucose number for you. I wish you the very best.",

Don't ask why, but I looked in my urine three times, pretty closely, and i saw what looked like sugar in it. Is this a problem?? and if so, how would I ask my mom to go to the doctors??",
