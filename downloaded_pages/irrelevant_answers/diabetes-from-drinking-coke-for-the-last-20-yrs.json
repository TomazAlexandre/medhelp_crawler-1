            "answer": "Hello Thomas,We're not physicians here, but are volunteers with a lot of experience with Type 1 Diabetes, an autoimmune disease.\u00a0\u00a0I'm glad to read you've found the courage to see a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0The irony, of course, is that we often \"know\" what we don't want the doctor to tell us -- and the longer we wait, the more damage can occur.Nothing you have written sounds like classic Type 1 diabetes symptoms, which include extreme thirst & hunger, frequent urination, weight loss, infections that don't heal, vision disruptions.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms you do mention seem quite well explained by your own explanations:\u00a0\u00a0poor eating habits, poor sleeping habits, and stress.Your eating & sleeping choices, coupled with stress also can cloud your thinking and make things seem a lot worse than they are.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes we get \"stuck\" in situations as if we have no choice to change things.\u00a0\u00a0Truth is, it is quite rare that we really have NO choices.\u00a0\u00a0However, sometimes the misery we endure seems \"better\" than facing the choices and the unknown results of those choices.Nonetheless, I'd encourage you really LOOK at your choices, since you recognize that the current choices are unacceptable for a healthy active life that a 23 year-old male can be enjoying.\u00a0\u00a0Also consider talking to your doc about possible depression; depression can lead to sleeplessness and often keeps folks \"stuck.\" Depression can be exacerbated by stress & poor food choices.Good luck, Thomas!\u00a0\u00a0I agree that you have a lot to gain by dealing with all this soon :-)",

            "answer": "The symptoms you describe could be reactive hypoglycemia, for in some people, when they eat or drink a food that has high carbohydrate content that is quickly digested such as soda, their bodies react to the sugar onslaught by producing TOO much insulin, which drops their glucose levels too low. Symptoms are headaches, lact of ability to concentrate, sleepiness, sometimes nausea, loss of energy, and sometimes depressed feelings while this is happening. You may want to ask your doctor to do a glucose tolerance test, and if you react strongly, you may need to do some diet changes in order to feel better. Carbohydrates aren't the problem, but the problem is how quickly they digest. Foods with complex carbs such as high-fiber foods don't tend to stimulate the pancreas as much as simple carbs like soda or sweet foods.",

            "answer": "I started with blood works showing high enzymes in my liver and borderline diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I also started for several years having an ichy/red rash right above the ankle.\u00a0\u00a0I would also drink diet soda/morning/afternoon and night with every meal. Not alot of water.\u00a0\u00a0I have been drinking tea with no sugar and lots of water for a couple of years . It's a decision i made voluntary.\u00a0\u00a0Blood sugar is okay and rash after suffering with the itching and ugly rash on my leg. the rash has disappeard. I no longer has that awful itching on my leg/s either.\u00a0\u00a0So I don't know if it giving up that soda was the reason. I just know i feel and legs look better so I am not going back to my old ways.Maria",

    "question": "I have not been to the Doctor since I was a kid because i am afraid of what I will find out. I guess my question is what is the possibility that I have diabetes if for pretty much my entire life, I have only consumed Coca Cola and rarely and I mean rarely have consumed any water. I am now a little bit older and see that these issues are a very big deal as to Diabetes and my general health. I am 5'8\" and only 130 lb. I don",
