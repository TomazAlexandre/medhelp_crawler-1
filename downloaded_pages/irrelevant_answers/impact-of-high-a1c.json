            "answer": "I wonder if you should look into a 504 plan.\u00a0\u00a0A 504 plan is a plan that helps a child with different needs relating to health issues, similar to an IEP(individual education plan-for children with learning needs)When you have a 504 plan you have to do some planning: get a note from the doctor and documentation of the diagnoses as well as information.\u00a0\u00a0You will have to have some meetings with the principal, school nurse and probably teachers.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest going to www.jdrf.org--the juvenile diabetes research foundation website.\u00a0\u00a0I think you will find useful information on that site to help.\u00a0\u00a0You might want to go to the letters ODST on the home page and click on it.\u00a0\u00a0You can then get help to get in touch with other parents and families in similar situations such as your family.High blood sugars can make a diabetic irritable and short tempered.\u00a0\u00a0I know, when I am crabby or short tempered the first thing I do is check my blood sugar and see if it is due to a high blood sugar.Also, her blood sugars could be a little higher because of hormones.\u00a0\u00a0The week before I am menstruating my blood sugars tend to go a little higher and I must compensate with more insulin.My teenage years were difficult because of diabetes and the highs and lows, but I think with support and knowledge of her body and why things are happening you will get through it.\u00a0\u00a0 When the blood sugars are more under control she will feel better and be more in control.\u00a0\u00a0When you feel good everything seems a little better and easier.",
