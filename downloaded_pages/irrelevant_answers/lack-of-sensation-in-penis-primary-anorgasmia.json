            "answer": "HI,I wonder if you have numbness in other areas of the body?You might want to see a neurologist but my experience with them has given me the idea that they are the most useless of all the medical doctors.You could have a condition of the nervous system causing the problems. Based on that I wonder about other areas of numbness.I myself have a condition that at times causes numbness in parts of the body. I have had it in the penis several times and currently experience it in my arms and feet.I sincerely hope that you will be able to this sorted out.Good luck,Ron",

            "answer": "Hi, I am 44 and I have never masturbated to ejaculation. In my late teens and throughout my 20's I was having sex but could hardly ever ejaculate with my girl friends so I had faked it numerous times just so it could be over. I seem to have very little sensitivity on my penis and the head. I am circumsized (like a serious crewcut) and so my head has always been exposed so i think the feeling I should have is practially gone. As I have gotten older it has become more of a mental thing to get to the point of \"finishing\". If my girl friend is really enjoying herself I can \"finish\". This has been a long difficult frustrating situation and especially now since I am single and celebate. I hope this sheds some light on what maybe happening in your case. Best of luck",

There is an active forum on another site that discusses anorgasmia too but I don't see any M.D.'s posting there.\u00a0\u00a0After trying to find an answer for years, I think this problem has to do with some kind of overactive \"fight or flight\" response.",

    "question": "I am a 24 year old male that has never had an orgasm.\u00a0\u00a0I thought I was maybe just a late bloomer, until I really noticed a difference in my sex drive compared to that of my peers.\u00a0\u00a0I went to a urologist and started seeing a sex therapist around a year ago. I began a relationship with a girl 4 months ago and only recently was comfortable enough to have sex.\u00a0\u00a0I then discovered that I had little to no feeling in my penis. I was aroused and able to have and sustain an erection, but there is never a feeling of pleasure or of release.\u00a0\u00a0I went back to my urologist a few days ago and confirmed the numbness with a pin ***** test, no pun intended.\u00a0\u00a0He told me there is no treatment for this problem.\u00a0\u00a0Obviously this is not the news I want to hear or settle for.\u00a0\u00a0What can I do?",
