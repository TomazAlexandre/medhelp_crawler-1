    "question": "Thank you for your time. I am a 26 year old male. I have a clean bill of medical health aside from diabetes. Excellent skin, except for the right corner of my lip seems to stay \"chapped\" all the time. I have looked at images of a fever blister and it is definitely NOT a fever blister. It's like the skin peels outward in small little \"shingles\" as it would with chapped lips on the main part of the lip. I may tend to sleep on my right side, and suspect that I may drool a little (lol) and cause this? I do have poor oral health and have lost most of my natural teeth due to diabetes. I also likely have less saliva than the average person due to occasional to often high blood sugars. I hope I've been descriptive, as I've included every thing I thought could be remotely relevant. Please help point me toward a solution for this. It is not painful, but very annoying and probably not the most attractive thing. THANK YOU! - JF",
