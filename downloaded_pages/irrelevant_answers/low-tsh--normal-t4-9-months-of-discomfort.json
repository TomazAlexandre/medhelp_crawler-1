            "answer": "This is most often an insignificant finding.However, would test TSI to screen for Graves and consider thyroid ultrasound to look for a nodule that may be producing a little extra thyroid hormone .Low TSH and normal T4/T3 is called \"subclinicial hyperthyroidism\" however this is usually not significant until TSH is < 0.1-0.2 range.",

    "question": "Hi! I'm 23 and have had hyper- and hypothryoidism briefly as a teenager. It's been normal ever since. I had a baby a year ago via Caeserean section and ever since have had all sorts of issues.I was diagnosed with IBS, put on an antidepressant and Bentyl. Had severe side effects that sent me to the ER. After havin panic attacks they put me briefly on Effexor which I also didn't react well to. This has all happened over a period of 9 months+. I initially was being seen for constant stomach pains. (CT, ultrasound and MRI done in my abdominals).This time I was sent for blood work for my thyroid. (Fatigue, excessive urination, aches and pains, headaches, anxiety, seemingly sensitive to cold, etc.). They also have run tests for lupus, rheumatoidal things and diabetes.The thyroid results were a slightly low TSH but a normal T4. She said it didn't balance and it usually does; that it was a lab error and I need retesting.I'm beginning to panic that I have a tumor or something serious. Can someone help? I don't have the lab result numbers, as they never give them to us in tangible form.Thank you!",
