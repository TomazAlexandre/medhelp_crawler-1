            "answer": "There are some reasons they are still used such as the fact that they are less likely to cause diabetes and metabolic problems. I asked my psychopharmocologist and that was his direct explanation. He and all psychiatrists use atypicals first. But you have never stated you had a problem in this area so otherwise they would not have changed you back to older medications. However, almost all people do better on the atypicals and they have far more of a mood stabilization property and are generally safer and easier to tolerate. If its a coverage issue appeal it. The company can't deny coverage of atypical antipsychotics completely. They have been around for 20 years. Your psychiatrist would surely prescribe anything from Risperdal to Ability. If the decision comes from a coverage issue speak to your local independent living center:http://www.ilru.org/html/publications/directory/index.html",

            "answer": "Your pharmo person is wrong. These medications cause prediabetes . There is absolutely no one in my family who has had or does have diabetes. There is a warning by the the pharm cos themselves about this problem in ALL the new typicals. Read the info yourself and the last one I was on (geodon) not only raised my blood sugar level again(now I am on metformin for life) but gave me psuedo parkinsonism. I have no choice but do go on the older anti psychs. It is not a choice I like but I have no desire for either side effect. Did I mention the granulomas I got from Risperdal? The entire backs of both hands as well as numerous places on my arms and legs will testify to this.",

            "answer": "I apologize. I should have stated \"there is a reason the typicals are still used\". That's the word I left out. You are in a really difficult situation as regards medications but there are many options as regards mood stabilizers in addition to antipsychotics which are on the list I posted.",

    "question": "I am having trouble keeping my thoughts straight so bear with me plz. Tegretol did not work out and I am now on haladol. What older antipsychs are left on the list? I cannot concentrate right now long enough to do the research myself. I need the antipsych to function as I become paranoid and delusional w/o them. My dr will not or cannot discuss treatment strategies for the future w/me if this fails also. I feel like my back is up against the wall and am feeling pretty hopeless at this point. I was on Navane before the new anti psychs came out so I know there are others and I think I was taken off it just to put me on the newer drugs - too many years ago to remember what happened. My thinking is not very clear at this point and I feel like I amm in some type of repetitive dream. Help!",
