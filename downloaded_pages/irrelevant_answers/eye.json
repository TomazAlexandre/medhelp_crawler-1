            "answer": "I have floaters, but they are mild, but I know they are a sign of detached retina. It's scary when you start having problems like that with your eyes. I have cateracts, they are genetic, but incipient at this time. Don't worry too much, Jane, just get regular exams. As long as your vision is not getting worse, you should be ok:)",
