The doctor will monitor your and baby vary close and if they see a change they'll either induce or do a c section so that you and baby stay safe. Then after birth they'll monitor you to make sure its gone away.",

At 36 weeks, you can be induced if they are concerned about the preeclampsia. Baby at this time is premie but has a good chance of survival and less time to none in the NICU. At 37 weeks you're technically full term",

Dr put me on bedrest at 34 weeks & had me do 2 betamethasone (sp?) shots to help mature my daughter's lungs. I was induced at 37 weeks exactly & labored all day to end with a csection due to running a fever. All worth it though! Daughter was healthy & scored 9/10 on her apgar at birth. She is now 10 & active in soccer with straight A's!",
