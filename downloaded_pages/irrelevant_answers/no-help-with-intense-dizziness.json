            "answer": "No, none of those things... The meds I was taking the doc said were for people with Meniere's disease and they worked while I was on them and for a few months after until now.It's so horrible. It's not like a spinning, it's like being yanked all over the place. Even as I write this I'm going back and fourth...I'll have to ask about those things. =[",

    "question": "I have been having so many health and anxiety problems this year, but the most annoying one is dizziness. I have posted before, because I've had many months of this.I had an MRI in January, I've had my ears checked by an ENT specailist and about 4 other doctors, my sinuses, my hearing, my movement, etc. All was negative bar vearing to the left slightly at one check-in. I have eye problems - I'm half blind, photosensitivity, nystagmus, septo-optic dysplasia, but all my eye tests proved normal, just as they'd always been.I was on Cinnerzine for a month and was so happy with the results - It stopped! For about... 2-3 months? Now It seems to be back. It's intense, horrible, like someone is grabbing my hair and yanking me side to side or backwards.I'd simply continue on the meds 100% of the time but I've been having worries about my blood thinning... If Cinnerzine even does that.Has anyone else had this?Since everything is negative, my doctor has been guessing it could be anxiety. But I've been a lot calmer and more composed lately and It has still come back strong. I can't take it... It's to the point where I can't even feel still when laid in bed.Do I just need to be more firm with my doctor and make her do more tests? I'm confused.",
