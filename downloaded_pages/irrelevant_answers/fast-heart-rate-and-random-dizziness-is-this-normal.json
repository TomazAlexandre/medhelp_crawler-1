            "answer": "Good point. I get that random tiredness thing too. Literally fell asleep while in the chair getting a haircut like 15 minutes ago. But I have insomnia in the night and don't sleep till 6 AM so probably just my sleep schedule. May be related to the other problems for both of us though.",

    "question": "I'm a 20 year old male, 160lbs, 16% body fat and diabetic of unknown type (endocrinologist is thinking type 1 but we're still figuring out) for two or three years now. I take insulin 2-4 times per day depending on number of meals but blood sugars have been in the 150 to 350 range since diagnosis.For the past month or two though I've been having random bouts of tachycardia everywhere between 80 and 120 resting and 140 to 160 with light exercise (numbers checked by Apple Watch so I'll assume it's accurate but haven't checked manually), severe dizziness upon standing, and random unprovoked dizziness out of nowhere; usually not together though. The other day it happened while driving and that was the final straw.So I saw my doctor the other day And had an EKG done and at the time of the appointment I didn't have any of the symptoms so it showed as fine. Blood pressure was normal as well (like always), and the only thing wrong in my blood test from a few days earlier was my A1C. He said to stay hydrated and eat more salt.I'm thinking it's a bit more serious than he wants to tell me though. Anyone able to help me out and give me a recommendation on what to check for? Cause this is starting to annoy me more each day. Was at 111 just now and I was just sitting on a couch watching TV. should I go to a hospital for this?Thanks for any help.",
