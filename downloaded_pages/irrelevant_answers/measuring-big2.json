            "answer": "Not necessarily. Baby's sizes and dates can vary at each visit and that's usually normal. If your uterus is measuring bigger, that can indicate that your uterus may have more than normal amounts of amniotic fluid. They can do an ultrasound to confirm whether it's extra fluid or the size of the baby. Depending on your stage in pregnancy, if you have gestational diabetes, that can cause you to have a large baby for gestational age.Hope this helps!",
