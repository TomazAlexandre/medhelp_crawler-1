    "question": "My daughter - age 21 has had numerous symptoms; fatigue (takes a nap every afternoon), inability to gain weight (110 lbs - 5' 7\"), digestive problems (constipation & delayed gastric emptying), freezing cold most of the time (2 prs. of socks & 10 layers of blankets); fairly low b/p 90/60, gets dizzy when standing, difficulty concentrating, trouble going to sleep (takes 1 microgram of Melatonin prior to bed time); terrible face breakouts that is causing scars & heavy painful periods; was taking b/c pills to ease up on her menstrual problems for over a year - started experiencing shortness of breath & rapid heartbeat with shaky hands in the spring of 2007; she has always eaten tiny meals throughout the day her entire life and we thought she was experiencing a drop in her blood\u00a0\u00a0sugar; doctor eventually referred her to cardiologist last year & I made an appt. with an endocrinologist; cardiologist had her wear an event monitor for a month, did an echo & suggested that perhaps the b/c pills were causing these symptoms; her TSH in May of 2007 was .55 (normal), in July of 2007 it was .29.\u00a0\u00a0At that time the endocrinologist didn\u2019t think the TSH level was the cause of her symptoms; she stopped the b/c pills and the shortness of breath & rapid heartbeat stopped; I guess I dropped the ball by not following up with endocrinologist re: low TSH level; did a follow-up appt. with cardiologist to clear up her medical history and he did some repeat thyroid tests: T4 - 5.37 (ref. range 5.40-12.00); T3 Uptake 34.4 (ref. range 32-48), FT1 4.61 (ref. range 5.20-12.90); TSH was .23 (ref. range .34-5.60); appt. with endocrinologist - was very concerned and said this was serious and she was concerned that the pituitary gland was not functioning properly - 2nd round of tests results: (SLN) Somatomedin C, IGF-I 250 (ref. range 138-410), CK, Total 61 (ref. range 96-140) - dr. notes on labs - this level is really OK - low due to the fact that she is a slender person - if the level is much HIGHER than normal, that can reflect inadequate amts. of thyroid hormone in the skeletal muscle; Free T4\u00a0\u00a0- 0.78 (ref. range 0.58-1.64) up from 0.62 in July 07); T3, Free - 2.75 (ref. range 2.50-3.90); (SLN) Coritsol - 4.2 (ref. range 4.3 - 22.4 (a.m.) & 3.1 - 16.7 (p.m.) (Notes from dr. even though this cortisol level looks normal, considering how stressed she was about having her blood drawn, I actually find this a bit low - want to do a cortrosyn stim test (my daughter experiences a vasovagal response when her labs are drawn).\u00a0\u00a0We have the cortrosyn stim test done on Friday.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m just so worried about her.\u00a0\u00a0The testing process is just a large puzzle with each result adds more to the picture.\u00a0\u00a0I love her doctor - she is excellent and very thorough - but the waiting is getting to me.\u00a0\u00a0Another symptom she has - that I cannot get any feed back on (her dr. said she didn\u2019t think this was a problem) is that she has a very, very strong odor to her urine all of the time (it wasn\u2019t like this when she was younger) - I noticed this when she was in middle or high school.What should we expect and look for with regards to future testing?\u00a0\u00a0As a parent I\u2019m worried about a benign tumor and want to rule that out.Many thanks to you.",
