            "answer": "Lurius,I know that you said you've been diagnosed with Type 2 and yet I wonder.\u00a0\u00a0Have you been diagnosed by an \"endocrinologist\" or a diabetologist?\u00a0\u00a0These folks specialize in treating our disease.Many type 1s begin our journey with a \"honeymoon\" where our bodies still produce some insulin, but the pancreas is sort of sputtering & spitting instead of humming smoothly along.It is good to get an accurate diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0If you are in the honeymoon phase, you will gradually need insulin.\u00a0\u00a0About 35 years ago, I was diagnosed as a teen.\u00a0\u00a0I was treated with oral meds for about a year.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not certain that 35 years later, an endocrinologist would suggest that course of action.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a physician, but I remember reading that low doses of insulin can actually work well to ease the strain on a stressed pancreas.If you are considerably overweight, then it is likely that you have some insulin resistance and that might well be Type 2.\u00a0\u00a0I'd just like to encourage you to see a specialist if it's at all possible for you to do so.",

    "question": "Well im new to the forum, this is actualy my first post. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes late summer last year, im 17 about to turn 18 soon. I started by monitering my diet and still I needed medication, so my doctor prescribed me with Glucophage XR 500mg, 2 pills a day taken at same time. They worked great, I never had a problem, then last month my glucophage was substituted with Metformin ER 500mg, same dosages, I noticed changes after about a week, my sugar was higher then it was on average with Glucophage, so I mentioned it to my mom, we kept monitering it, after about a month of being on it my blood sugar level was getting pretty high.. 2 hours after a normal sized meal(only 60-70 carbs) my bloodsugar was about 250-350, so we got the glucophage back finally, its been three days now and my blood sugar is still staying pretty high.What im wondering, is it common for this to happen? is it because of medication switching(ive heard that metformin is **** compared to glucophage)?.. Or maybe is my situation getting worse and my body isnt able to produce insulin as well as it was when I was first diagnosed?Thanks for the help, it is much appreciated,Michael",
