Although my daughter was born at 38 weeks weighing 6lb11oz when my scan that same week estimated her at 5lb and when my water broke it was a never ending amount and couldn't have possibly been low fluid around her!!",

If they are constantly high then yes you have a higher chance of having a big baby if they are under control then you have a better chance of a normal size baby. How this helps some.",

    "question": "I have gestational diabetes since 27 weeks I've been measuring small and every time its been two weeks behind so my midwife ordered a ultrasound for Monday. But what would cause this? Usually with diabetes you have a bigger baby and mine is small? I'm a very small person before pregnancy I was 105 soaking wet and that was at my heaviest. I had a growth and dating scan at 12 weeks and at 19 weeks I had my anatomy scan and everything was normal. Has anyone went through this? Is there something wrong with my baby?",
