            "answer": "I'm curious about something-I've had two episodes where I was taken to the ER.\u00a0\u00a0One was last summer- I was home alone, got a severe headache, took some tylenol, sat down to take a break and suddenly got very dizzy- my chest and arm felt as if I had a boa constrictor hugging me- numbness in my fingers, nausea, cold sweats.\u00a0\u00a0I called the triage nurse, thinking I had poisoned myself with the tylenol and she instructed me to call 911 immediately.\u00a0\u00a0Now, the same thing happened recently- minus the 911 call but each time, I was released and told to go to a specialist because they couldn't find anything but agreed that it was peculiar.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a female in my early 30's with a family history.What other causes are there for what I have described?",
