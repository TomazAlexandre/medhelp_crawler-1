            "answer": "I have all the symptoms you have and many more.I was told I have severe acid reflux. They did a endoscope and found nothing wrong.Told me to take acid reflux medication and it made things worse.It was discovered by my endocrinologist that I had reactive hypoglycemia, poss. low thyroid and poss. insulin resistance.My condition worsened and I am now seeing a lyme specialist for lyme disease. I have been on I.V antibiotics for a little over a month and oral antibiotics for about 5 months. I am not saying you have lyme disease but something is causing your body to ho haywire.Do you see an endocrinologist for the blood sugar testing?I would see a specialist not a general practitioner.I would also have a glucose tolerance test with insulin draw every hour and have your thyroid levels checked.If the thyroid is low it can slow down your digestion causing symptoms of acid reflux disorder. Low thyroid can also make it feel like you have a lump in your throat, pain in the frontal area of the neck and can cause you to cough.",
