            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The spasms could be due to gas as this in diabetes there is a slowing down of gut movement, constipation, gas and bloating. It can also be due to food poisoning or gastroenteritis. PCOD is also a cause of cramps and so is pelvic inflammatory disease. IBS, Crohn\u2019s and celiac disease too should be ruled out.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Hope this helps. Take care!",
