            "answer": "The Zone Diet ExplainedDiet is not a dirty word.It comes from the Greek root meaning \"way of life\". This is what the Zone Diet is. It's a way of life to help control gene expression to give you the longer and better life we all aspire to.The Zone Diet gives you the power to turn some genes on and turn other genes off. As a result, you feel your energy soar, watch your waistline shrink, and say goodbye to hunger. In the Zone you are now taking wellness into your own hands.Any diet that uses the word high or low to describe it is hormonally unsustainable. The only diet that can maintain hormonal balance for a lifetime must use the word moderate to describe it. That\u2019s what the Zone Diet is.It\u2019s moderate in:\u2022 Low-fat protein\u2022 Low glycemic-load carbs(mostly fruits and vegetables)\u2022 Heart-healthy monounsaturated fatsThe Zone Diet is about balancing your hormones within a specific range to control hunger on fewer calories while still getting the proper nutrients your body needs for long-term health. The Zone Diet can best be described as a moderate-carbohydrate, moderate-protein, moderate fat diet that has approximately one gram of fat for every two grams of protein and three grams of carbohydrates (the Zone 1-2-3 Method\u2122). These ratios represent the newest dietary recommendations from the Joslin Diabetes Research Center at Harvard Medical School for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes.",

            "answer": "With the right balance of protein, carbohydrates and fats, you can control three major hormones generated by the diet \u2013 insulin, glucagon and eicosanoids.Insulin \u2013 A storage hormone. Excess insulin makes you fat and keeps you fat. It also accelerates silent inflammationGlucagon \u2013 A mobilization hormone that tells the body to release stored carbohydrates at a steady rate, leading to stabilized blood sugar levels. This is key for optimal mental and physical performance.Eicosanoids \u2013 These are the hormones that ultimately control silent inflammation. They are also master hormones that indirectly orchestrate a vast array of other hormonal systems in your body.",

            "answer": "I had a test on this very topic today.\u00a0\u00a0On the Zone Diet (at least according to my textbook) the good thing was that this diet encourages mostly healthy foods.\u00a0\u00a0You eat the right mix of fats, carbs and protein and that keeps you trim and healthy by lowering insulin.The only bad thing they said about this diet is that the author stated he believed this diet would one day be \"considered the primary treatment for all chronic diesease states, with drugs being used as secondary backup\"Sounds like a good diet as far as the food goes.......as long as you don't believe it will cure diseases.Sorry to hear of your tx failures.\u00a0\u00a0Good for you for wanting to be eat a healthy diet.Isobella",
