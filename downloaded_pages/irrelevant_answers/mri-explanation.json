            "answer": "Hi!In general, increased T2/Flair signals indicate small vessel ischemic disease or changes of brain blood vessels. Since the lesion in MRI did not enhance with contrast it is unlikely to be a tumor or even a MS lesion.An increased T1 signal indicates deposition of fat, proteins, melanin, contrast agent or gadolinium. It can also occur in case of hemorrhage or metabolic disorders like diabetes. Sometimes an increased T1 signal is an artifact or false result.Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
