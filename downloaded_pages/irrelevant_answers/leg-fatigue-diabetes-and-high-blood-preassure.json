            "answer": "Is your husband taking any cholesterol-lowering drug? Drugs in the statin class (e.g., Lipitor, Zocor, etc.) can cause muscle weakness as a side effect. If he is taking such a drug, it would be a very good idea for him to mention this problem to the doctor that prescribed the medication so that he can be switched to a product that works better for him. This particular side effect can be a sign that the medication is adversely affecting his liver function, so it is not something to ignore.Just a thought. I hope you find the solution.",

    "question": "My husband was diagnosed about 4 years ago with type 1 diabetes and is insulin dependent.\u00a0\u00a0He is currently age 51.He has had high blood pressure and high cholesterol for most of his adult life.\u00a0\u00a0 Knowing this, he has been faithful to ride bike or run at least 6 days per week.One of the symptoms that prompted him to go to the doctor before diabetes diagnosis was pain in his legs, which went away after he was on insulin.I am concerned, now because in the past two to three weeks he has complained that his legs feel very weak and tired.\u00a0\u00a0He describes it as they do not move easily.\u00a0\u00a0He thinks this is due to extra use, however, the only thing different than usual exercise is kayaking, which takes upper body muscles.Is there a relationship to leg pain or fatigue and diabetes or high blood pressure?\u00a0\u00a0Is this something I should encourage him to discuss with his doctor?Any help in this regard would be appreciated.",
