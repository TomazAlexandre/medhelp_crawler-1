            "answer": "I use the Deltec Cozmo pump and like it very much. In truth, I don't think there is much of difference among any of the pumps. Your doctor is probably recommending Medtronic because it is by far the most commonly used pump, not because there is any really advantage to it over another one.I had a test program whereby I could try out three different meters for a couple of months to see which I liked best. Perhaps there is a group that does the same in your area. Don't be afraid to contact each of the different companies about trying things out. It may not be offered, but keep in mind that in addition to the $5000 or so price of the pump, you will be spending another $1500 a year in pump supplies. Companies want your business. Don't be afraid to negotiate with them.",

            "answer": "Hi my name is Brad, I am 18 and was diagnosed with Type I Diabetes a month ago. A week or two ago I met with my doctor and he said that I should consider pump therapy. He told me about Medtronics Minimed. I decided to conduct my own research on the issue of what pump is best for me. After a few days I have come to the conclusion that Deltec and Animas are the most tailored to my lifestyle. Also these two pumps receive much higher of a rating by patients than Minimed (HSBC http://www.research.hsbc.com/midas/Res/RDV?p=pdf&key=y8f6w0euwd&name=121747.PDF). Two feature that I like about these two pumps is that they both contain a customizable food/carb dictionary and are both waterproof.",
