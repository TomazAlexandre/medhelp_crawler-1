            "answer": "The first time I got a yeast infection I was about 15 and my dad too had to take me to the doctors I know it's embarassing but trust me your dad knows all about girls parts.If it's getting better I would go back to the doctors and get another dose of the 3 day medication, it could just be a severe infection which may take more than a few day dosage to cure.\u00a0\u00a0And use the cream on the external parts of your vagina it will offer relief to the itch.Go back to the doctors and tell him or her that it's still there and what should you do next.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortuantely you need medication to treat the yeast infection and avoid hot baths and heat is a good breeding ground for yeast.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry you have to go through this at 12 :(\u00a0\u00a0But please don't be embarassed yeast infections happen all the time and EVERY woman at one point or another goes through them.",
