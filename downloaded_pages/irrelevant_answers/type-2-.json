Precisely\u00a0\u00a0what did you eat, how long ago did you eat it, and you need a number of readings.The only way to tell for sure where you are in terms of diabetes at is to go to a reputable physician and undergo either a glucose fasting test or undergo an insulin clamp protocol.If you are already under a doctor's care such a pen may have value, but to take a single reading tells you ungotz. And ungotz won't get you a ride on the Metro.",
