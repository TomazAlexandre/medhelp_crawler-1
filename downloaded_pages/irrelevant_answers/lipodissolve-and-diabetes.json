            "answer": "generally the cost is 400-600$ per area PER TREATMENT, however the treatments are 3-4 weeks apart.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately some office require 50% of payment up front.\u00a0\u00a0Note that the area on abdomen can take 6-10 treatments, the arms(which count as only ONE area) take not so many.for the \"double chin\" I think I've gotten best results and that only takes 2-3 treatments for which I only charge 100$ per treatment since dose used is so small and procedure so quick. I don't personally make people pay 1/2 first....and I have excellent return rate of patients coming back so I know I\"ll get paid eventually.Dr John Capps, Complete Wellness, Rock Hill, SC",
