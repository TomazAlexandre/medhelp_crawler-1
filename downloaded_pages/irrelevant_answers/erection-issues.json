            "answer": "We are not doctors here but I would say that it could be a combination of a few things, your medications, your diabetes and the increased stress you're putting on yourself to perform. I would suggest that you do not go with the pump as it really doesn't work all that well. You could try the viagra but you want to consult all of your prescribing doctors to make sure that it doesn't cause any additional medical problems.Of course losing weight does help a lot too, it should help your increased stress over performance.Best of Luck!!!~S.A.",
