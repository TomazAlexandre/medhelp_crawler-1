            "answer": "Hello.Can you mention the artery/arteries which are calcified?Dementia is a manifestation of dysfunction of the frontal and parietal cortex, on a broad scale. In Dementia of the Alzheimer's type, there may be a generalized atrophy of the cerebral cortex.If the artery which is calcified supplies to these two lobes, there are chances of vascular dementia. It will have to be confirmed by MRA (Magnetic Resonance Angiography) whether the calcified artery is blocked or patent.You have not mentioned the age of the person. There is nothing much one can really do to prevent a possible dementia, as we don't know for sure if the calcification will produce dementia. If there is a history of hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol level, or any disease of the small blood vessels, these have to be controlled in order to prevent further calcification.Regards",
