    "question": "About a month ago I started having slight blurred vision out of the corner of my right eye. That eye also started getting a lot dryer than my left eye and I have felt some pressure by my eye. I saw an optomitrist, a neuro-opthamologist and had an MRI and nothing showed up. I don't have diabetes. I do have thyroid and hormone imbalances, but I've had those problems for years and this only started last month. What else could be causing it?",
