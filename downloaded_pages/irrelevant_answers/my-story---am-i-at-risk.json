At least with one of your insertive partners he can ne ruled out.\u00a0\u00a0 The stats for oral risk as I think you know are neglegent. But to be honest, I do not know if that includes swallowing sperm.All I can say with little consolation is, good luck, but at least you will not be waiting a long time for your results.",

            "answer": "Just some clarification on the test results. I asked a couple of months ago for the results to be sent and have heard nothing. What I would like to assume is that the reason I was turned down for insurance was because of the diabetes (very possible) and that since the diabetes issue is well know to my doctor, he has not called me because the HIV test showed nothing.Am I worried for nothing?Is my risk very low or non-existant?Chris",

            "answer": "Anal sex by nature is more risky than vaginal. I can't change that fact. But if a condom is used, there should be no risk.Insurance....\u00a0\u00a0it sounds like your doctor already knows the results, so can you call him then? I don't know candas insurance polocies but it is a business, and they do not want any risk exposure. So maybe it is diabetes....\u00a0\u00a0 the answer can be found pretty easily in your situation.So go find out, get this monkey off of your back",

            "answer": "Usually they will send you a letter telling you why you were denied. There is nothing written that an insurance company has to advise you of your results. If you want and are concerned about your status, I urge you to be tested. There is no since worrying about it, when you can find out on your own.",

    "question": "My story is that I am a 35 year old insulin dependant diabetic who recently applied for additional life insurance. A profile that listed my medical condition along with a bunch of medicine I am taking and an HIV urine test was submitted. I was rejected for insurance. (I promise I am getting to the HIV part). I am also bi-sexual. I have had about 8 receptive oral sex partners (only 2 actually ejactulated in my mouth) and 12 insertive oral sex partners. I have had protected anal and unprotected anal once each. I asked the guy I had unprotected anal with about his status and he e-mailed me and said he tested negative 1 month before and 3 months after we hooked up. I am unsure about the protected anal partner but I am pretty sure that none of his ejaculate got in me and that the condom was intact ( I saw him take it off in the bathroom and it looked intact). As well the unprotected did not ejaculate in me. I have heard that if directly asked most people will be truthful about their HIV status. This guy seemed trustworthy to me.I am scared shitless to get the results and I am anxious all the time. I can't bring myself to call and get the results. I did ask the results to be sent to my doctor's office but have not heard anything and I am trying to tell myself that no news is good news.My question is1) what do you think my actual risk is?2) Does anyone know anything about requirements for doctors offices to contact you if they recieve a positive result like this?3) I am in Canada and HIV is a notiifable disease here (must be reported to Health Care) does anyone know howthis process works or has been notified like this?Thanks for your replies. I am absolutely paralyzed with fear.Chris",
