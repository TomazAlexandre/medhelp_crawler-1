            "answer": "Are they solvent based paints where you work?\u00a0\u00a0Many solvents cause metabolic problems resulting in fatty liver and the storage of toxins.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors aren't allowed to tell you, detramental to business and all that.\u00a0\u00a0Check your RDW, MCH, MCHC, and MCV.\u00a0\u00a0If they're approaching the upper or lower limit ranges and your doctor hasn't examined why - sue him if you can. You live in Houston, so get away from the paint solvents and benzene if you want to keep living.",

    "question": "My husband is 38yrs old went to the family doctor for a cold he could not get rid of had it for three months and was finally given antiobiotics and something for allergies while trying to diagnose the problem he was found to have fatty liver with ast 48 and alt 62 withen a month and a half the alt went back to normal he does not smoke and ocasionally have 2-3 beers maybe 1 weekend out the month. we were shocked to find this out, he hadn't had a pysical in about 10 years\u00a0\u00a0but never really ever got sick an ocassional cold if that, he's about 5'8 at 172lbs never had a weight issue. the cold was finally diagnosed as very very strong allergies(lab showed this) but now we are told to wait a couple months so he can be watched for the fatty liver( ultrasound showed this) have an appointment with kidney specialist and we are scared to death I have read about polycystic kidney disease and praying thats not it but can't help it because of the four cyst seen on his right kidney by the ultrasound. he has had no back pain and every once in a long while only after a strenous day of lifting up 5 gallon buckets of paint(works for paint company) his hemoglobin Aic was 6.4 diabetes run in his family. Its so scary we went in for a cold which turned out to be allergies now we are hearing all this. all other labs were normal except\u00a0\u00a0this liver and kidney which are very important.He just started on a very low dose blood pressure med withen the last three months azor and doing good on that but the doctor said that because of the cyst they may had been the cause of the rise in blood pressure. Is all this info a cause to be alarmed. I read there is no cure for polycystic kidney disease only dialysis and transplant but that is still no gaurantee that the cyst wont return. I am afraid for him and not sleeping it is about 3:50 a.m now and my mind just racing. Please let me know other than change our diets and establish better eating habits what we can do to help with this situation. I am a runner and get plenty of exercise and he works in the yard a lot even after being on his feet 10 hrs a day. Can you tell me what may help with the fatty liver? I know that may have to do a biopsy on the cyst but we wont know anything until after his appointment with the specialist on march 13.",
