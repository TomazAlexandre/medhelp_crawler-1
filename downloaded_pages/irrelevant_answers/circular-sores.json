            "answer": "Hi,One differential for this is a boil.Boils may start as a small reddish bump that may rapidly grow in size.This eventually becomes tender,ruptures and drains thick yellowish pus.Boils are caused by staphylcoccal organisms that invade the skin through small cuts or wounds.You may require oral antibiotics for this.Consult your physician regarding this. Avoid unnecessarily manipulating or touching the area.Also,do you have other underlying disease like diabetes?Keep the area dry and clean.You may take pain relievers for the pain.",

            "answer": "I too have this issue. I was told it was mrsa and even years of being treated on again off again, still have this issue. In find it odd that my my daughter broke out with sores all over her body, was told it was chicken pox,but I know my stuff and I told them it clearly was not chicken pox. After three weeks of no school I had to demand answers. They were never blisters, no puss, just started as a extremely itchy bump and when scratched it began to open up and turn into a big sore. It has been 9 years and she still has the scars and they get itchy and they open up.",

    "question": "hi there i recently had what appeared to be an ingrowing hair on my upper leg, within a few days it had increased in size and burst, the wound was quite deep and oozing pus from the centre. i have tried leaving it open to dry and covered with a plaster and antiseptic cream, have also tried antibiotic powder but nothing has worked. as other people have expressed the wound is about the same size as a cigarette end, i have 2 other simular sores in the same region that appear to be growing to the same size as the first, all of which are quite tender to touch. any helpful advice would be greatly appreciated.This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/243791\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/243791</a>.",
