            "answer": "Hi.It is rare for an EMG to show some significant findings when there are no symptoms, especially the numbness. The weakness criterion is not essential, as it could be a sensory neuropathy only.As far as the Lyme testing is concerned, I think the routine testing is sensitive but not specific enough. I can't comment upon the IGENEX lab as I do not have any information. But I guess you can have a discussion with your new neurologist about the lab and a possible retesting for Lyme if he feels necessary.You can make a mention of EMG / NCS to him on Thursday.Regards",

    "question": "Well, this coming Thursday is my appt with the new neuro.\u00a0\u00a0Lets say for instance that she does do the EMG/NCS and the results are normal, saying that I do not have a form of peripheral neuropathy, then what?\u00a0\u00a0Does an EMG ever show anything when the patient doesn't have numbness or weakness?\u00a0\u00a0I'm starting to get a little scared, because I have been tested for so many things, and if it does turn out to be PN, then why do I have it?\u00a0\u00a0I have been tested for Lyme, diabetes, thyroid, metabolic disorders, lupus, etc....\u00a0\u00a0HELP!!Thank you, Jen",
