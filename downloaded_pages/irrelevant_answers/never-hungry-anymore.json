            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. One possibility is that you have an eating disorder. In which case taking help from a doctor specialized in treating eating disorders will help. Loss of appetite can be due to certain medications, drug abuse, depression, AIDS, acute and chronic infections, eating disorders, cancers and hypothyroidism.Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hi, I'm here because I am never hungry anymore. I can't even remember when this started happening, but my parents and sibling have noticed. I am a thirteen year old (turning 14 in June) girl and weigh 116 pounds and I'm 5 ft 5 inches. I'm not quite sure on what information is needed, but the main issue is that I am hardly eating. During breakfast I'll have a bowl of cereal. During lunch in school I normally eat a decent amount of my food but I'm not hungry. If I have lunch during the weekend, well, I don't actually have lunch, I'll just snack on chips or something, During dinner every night, I hardly eat anything. I don't not make myself eat for fear of gaining weight, although sometimes those thoughts come to my mind, but what teenage girl doesn't think that way sometimes. Another thing I have noticed is that sometimes I will just get really angry, sad, or even excited but the excitement normally comes to an end quickly. When I am hungry, the only thing I would want to eat is a snack such as chips or something sweet. I also am always tired, and just want to lay in bed. My parents however don't allow me to all day, so I feel weak all the time(mostly weekends). I appreciate all the help I could get on this subject. Thank you!",
