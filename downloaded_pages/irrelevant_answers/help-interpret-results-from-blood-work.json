            "answer": "To answer your questions:1) Most likely these results are due to alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0Other causes can include various liver diseases including fatty liver, hepatitis, any medication side effect, or a liver mass.2) Prolonged alcohol abuse will lead to permanent liver damage and eventually cirrhosis (i.e. irreversible liver damage).3) Further tests are needed to determine the extent of liver damage.\u00a0\u00a0An ultrasound would be a reasonable next step.\u00a0\u00a0Biopsy can also be considered if the results are not-revealing.4) Signs of liver failure include the following: difficulty clotting, ascites (i.e. fluid in the belly), inability to metabolize, encephalopathy (i.e. change in mental status due to inability to metabolize), or varices (i.e dilated veins increasing the risk of upper or lower GI bleeding).\u00a0\u00a0These are just a sample of the many complications.5) That would depend on the extent of the damage.\u00a0\u00a0If the damage has not been severe, then there may be no irreversible damage.6) Other than cirrhosis, other causes of death associated with drinking are cancers of the mouth, esophagus, pharynx, larynx, and liver combined; breast cancer in women; and injuries and other external causes in men.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

            "answer": "It's hard to conclude the degree of damage from blood tests alone, and especially just from those. They are abnormal, but not dramatic; most likely he doesn't yet have severe or irreversible damage. It takes some additional tests to know for sure. However, the amount of alcohol he's consuming is clearly too much, and he does risk various problems. In addition to cirrhosis, alcoholics are at increased risk for pancreatitis (a very severe inflammation of the pancreas, which can lead to many complications including infections, diabetes, etc, and can be life-threatening), pancreatic and esophageal cancer, liver cancer. Cirrhosis may not cause many symtpoms early on; as it progresses, there are many things, including jaundice, bleeding problems, abdominal swelling, wasting, tremors, mental changes.",

    "question": "My husband recently received results from a complete analysis of his blood.\u00a0\u00a0He's 39 years old and has a history of moderate to heavy drinking since approximately age 20.\u00a0\u00a0Consumption probably averages 6-12 beers 4-5 days per week, obviously sometimes much more or less.The results he received are:\u00a0\u00a0AST 46, ALT 75, GGT 108Can you offer me additional interpretation of these results?I'd specifically like to know what prolonged abuse will do to his liver and do these numbers confirm damage to his liver?If this confirms damage to his liver, to what extent is the damage?\u00a0\u00a0Mild, moderate, etc.What symptoms will be evident from continued abuse?What symptoms will still be evident if consumption is discontinued?Can you describe other problems that he could be facing other than cirrhosis?Thank you very much!",
