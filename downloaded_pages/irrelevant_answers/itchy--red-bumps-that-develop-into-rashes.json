            "answer": "Hi! I'd just like to report that I am well, and that I am now recovering from my condition.I went to an allergologist a week ago, and we found -- after a battery of tests -- that I was allergic to a lot of things. Most of my allergies are dietary in nature, but they also include pollen, dust, mold and cockroaches.I was given Aerius, Iterax and a certain cream Elica and they have worked well.",

            "answer": "Hi,Glad to hear that you are recovering from your symptoms and doing well.Try to avoid substances that are known to cause allergies in your case. It would also help to keep some antihistamine medications at hand in case of a sudden flare up of allergic symptoms.Let us know how you are doing.Good luck.",

    "question": "Hi! I'm 26 years old and currently suffering from itchy, red bumps that eventually develop into rashes. Most of these rashes are in my panty area, but I noticed a few just beneath my armpits, abdomen, neck and back, too.My dermatologist has given me corticosoid creams (pardon the spelling if it's incorrect) and Betneton tablets, but I don't seem to respond to them at all. I found rubbing some coconut oil on them quite soothing, though.My boyfriend does not have any similar rashes, and the doctor has not found any punctum, either.I have a history of diabetes in my family and I have gained weight recently, as well.Should I get a second opinion?Many thanks.",
