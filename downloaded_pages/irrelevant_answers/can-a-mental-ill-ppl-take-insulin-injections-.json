But they\u00a0\u00a0even said that if this medicine didn't work , you will have diabities. My problem is i m going to be disable in my country cause i need insuline but i have no proof do i have a diabities or not? But my body demands poision nuterlizer . Can a mental\u00a0\u00a0ppl take insulin injections? Well my body is healthy but to keep my body healthy i need to eat medicines. There is animal mixed in seroquel. I pay $500 for seroquel xr and the generic one is only 45 dollar for 60 days. It's a huge price difference. Can i take anti psycotic medicine as well as insuline injections? If not wave will break my hand and legs it's dangerous cause i have already experienced . i have already tried lots of medicine. Why doctor lie and don't say clearly that i had a diabetes? I am in trouble now.",
