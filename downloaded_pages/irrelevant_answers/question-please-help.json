            "answer": "I am diabetic and 34wks. I've been on weekly visits thru out pregnancy and am now on biweekly nst appointments. I am on glyburide 2.5mg 2x a day and have to be really strict with my diet. I was terrified at first cause of the risks to baby. I had a long discussion with my ob dr, a perinatal specialist, and a pediatrician.\u00a0\u00a0Risk of stillborn is mostly if you go past 38wks and levels are not strictly controlled. Hence why inductions or c-section are scheduled more for diabetics. My drs were/are more concerned with babys sugar level dropping quickly once the umbilical cord is cut and her body being able to adjust. Also diabetes makes babies tend to be larger. (We are measuring 2weeks ahead n 6lbs12oz, mind u that can be up to a lb off) keep an open dialogue with your drs about your concerns. Keep close track of your levels, for me I stay under 90fasting and 120 2hours after eating. Its hard especially with prego cravings but focus on today today and tomorrow tomorrow. That's how I've done it and its helped. Good luck",

Not trying to be nosy and butt in your business but levels at 275, 300 are really serious. What med have they put u on? Levels like that will require insulin and possible hospital stays to get it down and can cause pregnancy loss. Not trying to scare or upset you, just let you know my experience and what I have learned going thru a pregnancy loss due to extremely high sugar levels and how I what changes and things I have gone thru to have a healthy (as possible) pregnancy and healthy baby.",
