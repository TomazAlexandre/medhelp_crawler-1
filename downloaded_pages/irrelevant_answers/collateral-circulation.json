            "answer": "Although there is not conclusive evidence tests have findings that collateral vessel development is poorer in obese patients (defined as BMI (calculation based on height/weight...normal 18.5-24.9; obesity 30 or greater) with ischemic heart disease compared to normal range BMI, and the risk of having poor collateral vessel development is significantly increased. However, this might be associated with metabolic syndrome, in which insulin resistance plays a major role.For some insight the formation of coronary collateral vessels is a compensatory mechanism secondary to repetitive or chronic myocardial ischemia. During the past three decades the functional and prognostic benefit of such collateral vessels has been established. There are large interindividual differences in the number and extent of collateral vessels that may be explained by differences in the anatomic situation or by differences in the individual capacity to develop functional collateral vessels. Diabetes mellitus has recently been identified as one of the first negative predictors of collateral vessel formation.Development of coronary collaterals (CCs) is triggered by the gradient between arteries due to obstruction and myocardial ischemia. Presence of CCs that feed the jeopardized myocardial area may limit the infarct size after coronary occlusion and may even provide a survival benefit. However, some patients develop good CCs, whereas others do not. The metabolic syndrome (MS) has been identified as a secondary target to decrease cardiovascular risk, although the effect of MS on development of CCs has not been investigated. We prospectively enrolled 596 consecutive patients (337 men and 259 women; mean age 56 \u00b1 8 years) who underwent coronary angiography at our center and were found to have total occlusion of the right coronary artery. Patients were then classified as having good CCs (Rentrop\u2019s grades 2 to 3) or poor CCs (Rentrop\u2019s grades 0 to 1). There were significant differences in terms of body mass index (kilograms of body weight divided by square meters of height), glucose levels, triglyceride levels, and years with angina pectoris between those with good and poor CCs. Prevalences of diabetes mellitus were 27.1% among patients with good CCs and 44% among those with poor CCs (p <0.001). Presence of MS was significantly higher in patients with poor CCs than in those with good CCs (78.4% vs 49.2%, p <0.001). In regression analysis, duration of angina pectoris (\u03b2 = 0.347, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.266 to 0.453, p <0.001), presence of diabetes mellitus (\u03b2 = 1.829, 95% CI 1.021 to 3.279, p = 0.042), wall score (\u03b2 = 2.379, 95% CI 1.356 to 4.173, p = 0.003), and presence of MS (\u03b2 = 2.993, 95% CI 1.541 to 5.813, p = 0.001) were independent predictors of angiographically determined poor CCs. In conclusion, MS seems to be independently associated with poor CCs in patients with an occluded right coronary artery._________________________________________________________OLDER AGE REDUCES COLLATERAL VESSEL DEVELOPMENT IN CARDIAC DISEASEJune 24th, 2001 by Sonia Nichols, senior medical writer -In older patients with long-standing effort angina, the growth of new vessels that would increase circulation to heart tissues after a heart attack does not occur as well as in younger patients with similar cardiac disease.In patients with coronary blockage, the body attempts to compensate for the occlusion by generating new branches of vessel growth in areas adjacent to the blockage. Scientists call this process collateral development. Researchers believe patients who experience heart attacks, particularly those who have experienced chest pain or angina during physical effort, are prior beneficiaries of collateral development,..._____________________________________________________It may be that one who is treated for ischemia does not develop collaterals as the treatment may signal compensatory reaction is unnecessry.\u00a0\u00a0It is the gradient pressure of gradual occlusion that would signal myocytes for compensating angiogenesis...a dilated vessel (stent or medication) may not indicates any distress and the system would not call for compensation. It is a proposition I cannot disproveMy collateral bypass of the LAD obviously developed over a long period of time.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't have any chest pain (angina) so there was never any treatment prior to an event of CHF.",

As I read your post it says your husband had 3 CABG and 10 stents and that ALL of them\u00a0\u00a0are occluded. i would be most grateful is you would confirm this. I'm 81, just been diagnosed as having 'suspected' triple occlusions. The cardio has me on medicines for two weeks to see how it goes before we go onto to intervention treatment. which I cannot afford.",
