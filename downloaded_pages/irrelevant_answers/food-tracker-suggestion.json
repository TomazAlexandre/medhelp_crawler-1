    "question": "I would like to suggest creating a food tracker, so users can track the foods they eat and the symptoms that follow. I have been having a hard time keeping an organized food diary to try to determine food allergies and intolerances and such. I think a food tracker would be very beneficial, not only for those who are trying to monitor food reactions, but also to manage their weight and keep a log of what they are eating every day.",
