            "answer": "Hello Lolly79! I feel for you! I feel bad that you are so young and having to deal with all this. I am 43 and am just now going through all this. Alot of your symptoms are the same as mine. Honesty alot of it sounds like anxiety, but I know it is all very REAL. Believe me! I layed awake all last night worrying about my muscle twitches. I have had them for about a year. I had low Calcium and Vitamin D and the calcium is normal again but I don't know about the Vitamin D yet. When your chemistry levels are off it can reak havoc so get those levels all checked out. Most of all try not to panic. It makes it worse. I am right there with ya. Take care! Get better sweetie!",
