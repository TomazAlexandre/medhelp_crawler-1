    "question": "Hello all,I was wondering if a missing or non working thyroid has anything to do with the regulation of blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0I have noticed since my removal I HAVE to eat now or I get extremely tired or the feeling of fainting.\u00a0\u00a0Is this normal and has anyone ever noticed this before.\u00a0\u00a0This is one of the question I plan to ask my endo tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0I used to be able to not eat (Crappy diet I used to have) without any problems and now I have problems.\u00a0\u00a0I luckly have not gained any weight at all I think I am at the same weight before my surgery.\u00a0\u00a0However, (be prepaired to laugh) I think I gained a Buddha belly.\u00a0\u00a0hahaha.Anyways, any one have these problems?Cheers,Scott",
