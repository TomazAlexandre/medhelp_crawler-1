Started feeling shaky when I got back, so I checked my sugar FG 63. Just heated up a brat from last nights dinner, hopefully that will help.",

    "question": "Hello All been feeling out of sorts, started seeing a new (better) doctor and per suggestions from others bought myself a glucose meter online to check my levels. Back on 6/5 in office blood tests showed non fasting Glucose levels at 56 (range 65-99), lab results from 6/26 Hemoglobin A1c 5.5 (range 4.8-5.6).Glucose meter results (need to get better at taking these)7/12 FG 1067/13 FG 77 PP 927/14 FG 72 PP 817/15 FG 71 PP 1097/16 FG 113I'm keeping a log of this encase I need to show them to my doctor. Should I bring these up to him on my next visit? He seems a little overwhelmed with me right now because I have so many different things going on and he's really trying to figure out whats going on within me. I initially posted in the Thyroid forum when this all started happening, the link is below and will give you a little more insight to what I've been going through (to long to re-post it here).Thanks for reading :)",
