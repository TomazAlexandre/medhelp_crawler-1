            "answer": "It's important to have a full pituitary evaluation -- this includes tsh, t4, t3, acth, cortisol, prolactin, fsh, lh, estradiol (likely normal with menstrual periods) and possibly growth hormone.\u00a0\u00a0Also check sodium level - but it doesn't sound like you have diabetes insipidus (these patients have severe thirst and inc'd urination).\u00a0\u00a0The TSH alone of 6 may be a primary thyroid problem OR a pituitary problem, but more likely primary thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Also note any visual changes or headaches -- the labs will be the key to any endo eval....good luck.",

            "answer": "Thanks so much for taking the time to answer these questions. I will print this out. I am going back to my very good PCP to ask for either an endo referral or for him to at least do these tests. The doc I am referred to as \"endocrinologist\"\u00a0\u00a0by neuro's\u00a0\u00a0office assistant, is an internist, which I already have. Assistant and I are having a \"disagreement\" about this. So as said above, will go to my own internist, start again from there, report this disagreement to the neurologist at my next follow-up in early November.Thank you again :)",

    "question": "Thank you for taking my query. Am 47 yr old F. I had a craniotomy in May to remove a 3.0 cm right convexity meningioma. I know that some \"issues\" are related directly to that, but now am having exacerbating metabolism sypmtoms. Weight gain (15 lbs in 3 mos-never gained weight like this before) Fatigue,feel cold most of the time. Have noted most of hair on arms is gone, very sparse growth legs. Periods heavier, legs seems puffy (specially about knees).Some puffiness/face.\u00a0\u00a0Problems w/ dry skin/scalp. Night sweats. Have had some left side paresthesias I know are residual from surgery (arm) but also has developed bilaterally in chin/lower face. And now top left foot.\u00a0\u00a0Asked GYN to do hromone tests,resposne was negative, since my periods seem \"regular\" to him. Insisted on at least thyroid test. He did TSH\u00a0\u00a0<?>\u00a0\u00a0which came back at 6.Reported symtpoms to neurologist last visit, he agreed to refer to endocrinologist. Now I see this appt is with Internist, not board cert. endo. Getting that sorted out. Are these symptoms related to thyroid difficulty? Pituitary?\u00a0\u00a0I feel at moment ALL hormones out of whack. What might I expect at first endocrinology visit?Thanks again for your time.",
