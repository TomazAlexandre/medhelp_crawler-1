            "answer": "Hi,Small vessel ischemic disease or small vessel disease or white matter disease occurs due to blockade of small vessels in the brain resulting in minute areas of brain damage.This can occur in patients with long standing history of headaches, migraines, smoking, alcoholism, diabetes, high BP, brain infections, or stroke.It is important to correlate these findings with your symptoms. Also there is evidence that patients with small vessel ischemic disease have increased risk of stroke.Thanks",
