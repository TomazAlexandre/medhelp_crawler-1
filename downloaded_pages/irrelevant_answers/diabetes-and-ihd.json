            "answer": "Yes, you could develop ischemic heart disease with high lipid profile and hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0with high lipid profile, it builds up plaques in the arteries which could lead to constricted arteries and therefore decreased oxygen level to the heart causing angina (chest pain).\u00a0\u00a0hypertension does the same thing as well as the high blood pressure cost harden of the arteries cause decreased oxygen supplies.\u00a0\u00a0The next step to healthy living is to eat well, have lots of vegetables (follow the canadian food guide).\u00a0\u00a0I do recommend ground flaxseed, it has omega 3 in them and high in fibre, it will help decrease triglyceride and LDL.\u00a0\u00a0For your hypertension, do decrease salt intake (follow the DASH diet).\u00a0\u00a0The next important thing is to exercise, take medications as prescribed, monitor blood sugar & blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0hope this helps!",

            "answer": "You've already gotten good advice so I am posting more out of curiosity so will understand if you ignore ym nosiness.. :)You mentioned insulin but not any other medications. With the information you've given, I would expect you to also be on a statin (something to lower your cholesterol) and probably aspirin. Plus, I am thinking if your triglycerides are still elevated, it may mean your blood sugars are not well controlled.\u00a0\u00a0So, are you on preventive medicines and is your blood sugars under control?\u00a0\u00a0If not, then this needs to be addressed because if you are having chest pain, an okay ECG doesn't mean anything. The ECG only changes if there is damage (and not on everyone - so it is just another indicator not an absolute) or if it happens to be ran when you are experiencing the chest pain (and even then can not show anything).\u00a0\u00a0There are other tests that need to be done to find why you are having chest pain and these need to be done. You really need to know if you are having chest pain due to poor blood flow to the heart - admittedly, from what you have written, this is the most probably cause but doesn't have to be.Is your doctor doing a workup still?\u00a0\u00a0If not, you need to go to a cardiologist - don't let this workup stop with just a normal ECG - you are way too young to let this ride - and you need answers really soon. If it turns out to be due to heart, then medications and doing healthy living really will help. The goal for reversing pre-existing heart disease is 60/60/60 - LDL 60, HDL 60, and Triglycerides 60.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of this has to do with diet, exercise, and medications... I haven't made it yet but am still trying. :)Take care.",
