            "answer": "One of the major symptoms of anxiety is frequent urination. The dry mouth is from the antidepressant and should go away. I would not\u00a0\u00a0think you have diabetes but just to be sure have a dr. do a test for it. Go to anxietycentre.com and look at the symptoms for anxiety, you will be amazed at what it does to you mentally and physically. How long have you been on the Cymbalta? If it is more than 6 weeks and it is not working have your dr. prescribe something else. It often takes trial and error to find the med that works for you.Good Luck",

I'm been on Cymbalta for almost 10mo... it worked at first, but I am slipping again. Thanks for your input!!",

    "question": "I have been worrying about my health for a while now. Ever since last December, I have been worrying a lot about getting diabetes. I'm 5\"6 and 125lbs (female), so not overweight. 21yrs old. But I can't stop the worrying. For some reason, the past few days I have been really focusing on it, and am now starting to get symptoms of frequent urination for example. Does anyone ever have that w/ anxiety? Also I am on Cymbalta, obviously it is doing nothing for me. But I think it gives me a dry mouth/increased thirst. When my anxiety comes on, I take this dry mouth/thirst to be a symptom of diabetes! Anyone ever have anything like this?",
