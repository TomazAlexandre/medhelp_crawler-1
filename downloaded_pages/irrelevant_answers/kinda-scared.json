    "question": "So I had my first doctor appointment last week and the doctor told me because I habeen diabetes tht they wldnt even see me I had to go to the main hospital for all my appointments OK Im not on insulin or meds this is controlled by diet but they stopped the appointment so I guess my question is when do they start telling you you to take prenatal and really how high risk am I? I'm scared and very aggravated with this doctors office. This will be my first baby and I already am stressed out about a million and one other things. Any advice for me?",
