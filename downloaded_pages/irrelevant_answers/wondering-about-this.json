            "answer": "Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common medical conditions. Most people have experienced upset stomach, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, gas in the GI tract, or changes in bowel habits (e.g., diarrhea, constipation).I'm sorry but it is just impossible for any of us to guess and I really believe you are over worrying here. Without your husband going to a doctor reading stuff on the internet and not knowing what one is looking for creates way to much stress, it is very easy to convince ones self things are much worse then what they are by doing this... Until your husband decides he wants to at least see a doctor there is nothing you can do. I can read a lot of things on the internet and believe I have a lot of problems when really there is nothing to worry about...... Hang in there and good luck.",
