            "answer": "Hi,if your diabetes is well controlled there should be no issue to letting you go into labor naturally..... you do not automatically have to be induced.\u00a0\u00a0Talk frankly to your doctor about it.U/s are not very accurate for sizing a baby!With my daughter, I was allowed to go into labor naturally. But I had the\u00a0\u00a0opposite problem, I was having premature labor, whcih they had to stop.\u00a0\u00a0I finally went into labor naturally at 38 weeks exactly.\u00a0\u00a0My daughhter was fine.",

            "answer": "I have had GD with all three of my pregnancies (I am currently 28 weeks pregnant right now and was diagnosed at 24 weeks with GD)I had insulin with my son (2nd pregnancy) and am on the verge of having it with this one.I also started having u/s 1x a week when I was pregnant with my son, they were called Bio-Physical profiles and they measured the size as well as to watch for movements, he needed to move at least 3 times during the U/S.\u00a0\u00a0I also have NST 2x a week during that time.I asked my doctor why so many NSTs and U/S and was told that when you are on insulin it can actually cause the placenta to dry up faster and lose amniotic fluid and that is what they are watching for.\u00a0\u00a0That way they can determine if they need to get the baby out.My doctor personally doesn't allow any of her GD women go past their due date.\u00a0\u00a0She will induce on their due date just to make sure baby doesn't get too big or anything happens with the placenta and amniotic fluid.Good luck!\u00a0\u00a0Let me know if you have any other questions.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I am a veteran to GD now!~Theresa",

            "answer": "Thanks for the replies. Both of my previous children were went past their due date and both had shoulder dystocia (and my daughter was only 6lb 11 oz). However, I know that every pregnancy is different and my youngest is 19 so things are different now.",

    "question": "I am now 32 weeks 3 days. I was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes about a month ago and have been working closely with my doctor and an AWESOME diabetes educator.At first I lost weight like crazy and it took a while to get my blood sugar (particularly my morning blood sugar) consistently in the target range. Thankfully, the weight loss has stopped and I actually gained weight between appointments with my doctor (the nurse checked though and on Tuesday, at 32 weeks, I weighed 1 lb LESS than I did at my first prenatal appointment).I would never have imagined that I would be comfortable checking my blood sugar at least 4 times a day and injecting insulin before every meal and at bedtime (I have always been a HUGE needle-phobe), But, I'm doing it :)The doctor says the baby is growing. She wants me to have another ultrasound (not sure when) and to start weekly NSTs (Non-Stress Tests) to monitor the baby.For those who have dealt with GDM...did your doctor induce you or let you go? I am wondering if the US and NSTs may indicate that my doctor is thinking of doing an induction at 38 weeks but I haven't asked. Both of my other children went over (in fact with my son I was in the hospital for a scheduled induction because I was too overdue and went into labor on my own). But, my youngest is 19 and things are VERY different this time around.",
