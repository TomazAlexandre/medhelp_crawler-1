            "answer": "> When i went to the er they said we don't understand why he would give u a steriod shot for a cold?I'd thought that exact same thing. What possible benefit? Besides, steroids are immunosuppressive so why take that chance of provoking a secondary bacterial infection?As you likely know, there is such a thing as steroid induced diabetes. Steroids will increase insulin resistance while also increasing gluconeogenesis. But one shot wouldn't likely cause a long terrm problem, except for a spike in BG right afterwards,depending on what you'd eaten.Btw, my father had been on prednisone for months. I ad him on only low GI foods and he never had a problem and never needed aninsulin shot - EXCEPT when he was in the hospital and eating their food, from the diabetic menu no less.",

            "answer": "Hi Dawn,I have also had the \"lovely\" steroid shot and will never get one again.\u00a0\u00a0My heart pounded the whole time, and I was soooo thirsty, constantly drinking water and peeing all the time.\u00a0\u00a0I went back to my internist, and he ran some very specific kidney function tests.\u00a0\u00a0I guess sometimes the steroids can damage the kidneys resulting in diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Fortunately my tests were ok and the symptoms went away.\u00a0\u00a0But I have read about people who got diabetes from longterm steroid use.\u00a0\u00a0Surprised happened to you after just one shot.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the shot \"unmasked\" a diabetic condition that was brewing under the surface?",
