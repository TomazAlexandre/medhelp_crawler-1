            "answer": "Hi there!Asacol is not particularly recommended in patients with renal damage, but the issue is that alternative drug therapies may not be as effective or may have varied side effects. Nevertheless it is advisable to replace it with nicotine patches and one or the other newer drug modalities that bypasses the kidneys to prevent it from further damage. It would be best to discuss this with your treating gastroenterologist.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
