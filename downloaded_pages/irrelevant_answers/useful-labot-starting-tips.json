    "question": "was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. It was borderline over. One Dr doesn't believe I actually have it just have to check it to be safe. I'm 39 wks. Less than a week ago I got bellspalsy. Had to start medication, according to one dr it would throw off my diabetes and make it go crazy & needed to be induced. Went in Wed afternoon to be induced. Stayed on pit til Thurs night. Cervix didn't soften, nothing happened, so sent me home this morning. How do I help start labor to avoid c-sec? Cause of GD I have to have baby by June 12. So any quick useful tips? Help please",
