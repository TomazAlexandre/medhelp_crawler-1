            "answer": "Usually with pericarditis there is a fever.\u00a0\u00a0Has the underlying cause for the pericardium inflammation been diagnosed?What happens after treatment for the condition may depend on the underlying cause.Most episodes of pericarditis after a heart attack resolve by themselves and need no further treatment. The focus is usually on treating the underlying heart disease. In some cases, treatment may be needed in the future for repeated episodes of pericarditis.In most cases, this condition causes few or no long-term effects. In some people, this condition may come back several times with severe pain, but it usually responds to treatment each time.The results of the echo is a good source to rule out pericarditis as it can view any abnormal effusion in the pericardial sac.How is the condition monitored?If the symptoms go away, the only needed monitoring is for the underlying heart disease. Someone who has had a heart attack needs close monitoring and treatment to prevent a second heart attack. Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to the healthcare provider.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your reply.No diagnosed cause - most cases of pericarditis are idiopathic and the usual suspicion is a viral infection.I'm getting spells of breathlessness at rest every three days or so, at the moment. Given that there were no further signs of pericarditis (or anything) at the last follow-up, I'd really like to know what's going-on with the breathlessness :(I'd be really interested in other people's experience of breathlessness after pericarditis.I've got another appointment with my GP on Thursday to re-evaluate, and he indicated he'll refer me to someone else if I'm still having symptoms.",

    "question": "Hi,Some background: I am a 32 year old male, mild NASH (inflammationlevel 1 on a scale of 1-6), enlarged spleen (14cm), expecting imminentdiagnosis of IGT or diabetes following high results from OGTT (fastinglevels normal). No history of asthma or breathing conditions, though Ioccasionally wheezed a little when exterting myself when younger.I've recently dropped from 306 lbs to 270 lbs in seven weeks followingfirst indications of diabetes (substantially different diet).Went to A&E (ER) just over 2 weeks ago with tight chest pains. NormalECG, sent home. Returned in the evening as pain worsened. Diagnosedpericarditis based on physical exam, ECG (not normal) and hand-heldultrasound scan. Chest X-ray and blood tests for heart attack andblood clots found no additional surprises. (BPs were normal(ish), Ithink).Pain dramatically improved over 24 hours - resolved in a couple ofdays. But I still had periods of breathlessness at rest.The nature of the breathlessness is that I can physically breathe withno problems, but \"feel\" breathless, even if I breathe morerapidly. Lips and fingernails normal, I can move about, etc. Withexertion, I don't seem to get significantly more breathlessness than Inormally would.\u00a0\u00a0It often seems to come on in the evening and lastuntil around the middle of the next day. It doesn't seem to be relatedto stress or panic.On Tuesday, 2 weeks after the initial diagnosis, I had a follow-up atthe chest pain clinic. ECG, treadmill ECG, BPs all normal. They saidno further signs of pericarditis. Awaiting official results ofechocardiogram, but the operators indicated there wasn't anythingobviously wrong. As the breathlessness had been much better on theprevious day (Monday) I assumed this meant that I was recovered.All was well until yesterday (Thursday) evening, when breathlessnessreturned, lasting until around 2pm today. (My GP instructed me toavoid exertion. I'd been a little more active yesterday - doing somehousework instead of sitting still.)My main questions are: could this breathlessness have been caused bythe pericarditis and persist after the medical signs of pericarditishave passed? If so, will it resolve on its own? Is it common forbreathlessness to persist, and for how long?Any additional advice/ideas would be gratefully received. My GP isn'tsure what's going on, and has given me an asthma inhaler to try, tosee if it helps.Many thanks, in advance, for any advice.",
