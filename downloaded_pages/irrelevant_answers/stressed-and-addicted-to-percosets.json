I know you are scared and that is normal, but I think I read on another post that they took percocet during pregnancy and everything was fine (but check for yourself). It sounds like you have a lot going on and you need all the support you can get...we are all here for you, but you also need people near you that you can talk to face to face. You are worth it and so are your kids...you shouldn't be in so much pain...please get help!",

But I can tell you that it's best to tell your doctor what's going on.\u00a0\u00a0You're right there is the risk of hurting the baby going off the meds ct, I believe most doctors would set up a taper plan with you until after you deliver.\u00a0\u00a0The best way to get help for the pain, the addiction and the baby is to speak honestly with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Hang in there, ok?\u00a0\u00a0You & the baby will make it thru this okay.",
