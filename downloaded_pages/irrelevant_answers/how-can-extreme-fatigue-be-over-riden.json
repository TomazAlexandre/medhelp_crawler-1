            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!To get rid of the fatigue you have to find the cause. Extreme fatigue could be due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems. Another possibility is sleep disturbances (like sleep apnea, imbalance of rapid eye and non rapid eye movement sleep etc.). You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, low Vit b12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium. Hyperthyroidism too causes increased sweating and tiredness.\u00a0\u00a0 A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Diabetes too is a possibility.\u00a0\u00a0Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Hope this helps. Take care!",
