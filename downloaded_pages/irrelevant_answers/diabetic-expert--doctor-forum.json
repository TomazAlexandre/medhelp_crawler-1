            "answer": "Thank you ,its good to know it is being worked on ,as a pre diabetic I have to be able to ask what other folks are going through and how they cope , sometimes on the patients forum the questions are not answered and the people asking get a short shrift answer with no empathy , I would expect that on the expert forum but not the patient forum as we are there to support each other..hence once the expert forum is up and running then hopefully those who need expert answers will go there .Thanks again .",
