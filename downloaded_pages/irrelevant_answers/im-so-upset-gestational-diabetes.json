            "answer": "hey girl, long time no talk. was this result after the 1-hour test or the 3-hour test? Borderline isn't too bad it probably doesn't require anything more than a slight diet change. I've never had it before, but my cousin had it with both pregnancies. I know that fast weight gain isn't always the only cause...sometimes your body just loses the ability to handle certain things with successive pregnancies and since this is your second (I think I'm remembering right?) you may just have developed it out of hand. Hang in there hon...do you have to get another test or are they just recommending a change in your diet and monitoring?",

            "answer": "I have had gestational diabetes with all of my boy pregnancies. I have always been able to diet control mine. Just read the label on and make sure that you are getting enough protein. What has your dr told you and what is he recommending? I can share more with you if I have more info.",

I asked my doc is it is possible that my uterus is tipped more to the right creating more pressure on that side and he said it's very like the culprit.\u00a0\u00a0Mention the swelling to your doctor so he is aware of it but I don't think it's anythign to worry about.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 23 weeks today and the last several days I've been swelling like crazy.",

With all of your swelling, I would be worried about pre-eclampsia, especially when it presents at 24 weeks and after. You could just be retaining a whole lot of water. Start drinking lots and lots of water! But no reason to cry hun. I know it's upsetting but seriously I was JUST fine!! =)",

    "question": "Hey ladies hope everyone is feeling well!Yesterday I went in for my gestational diabetes test, my doc. sent me in early because I am measuring a little big.Well I got the phone call this morning and I am boarder line! Im so upset, I spent the night in the ER with my son because he said he had swallowed a battery and then I get this call!? (He didnt eat a battery, he has been telling a lot of stories lately)\u00a0\u00a0And to top it all off Im a swollen like a balloon! Its driving me crazy!!!I have been reading about it all morning and Im a little confused, I am over weight even before the pregnancy but I have only gained 5-6 lbs and I am 23 weeks. The only thing I cant think of is that I have been eating a lot of home baked goods (cookies and treats) but that is it. I really dont have anything else they list for being at risk. It said that if you gain to much weight to fast that can cause it among other things....I guess I'll deal with it but I have been fighting tears all morning!Anyone else have gestational diabetes or had it before??",
