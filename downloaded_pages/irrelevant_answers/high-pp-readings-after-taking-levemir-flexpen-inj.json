            "answer": "You wife needs both the long acting insulin (Levemir) to be taken twice a day, and she will also need a fast acting insulin (such as novalog, Humalog or aphidra) to be taken just before eating so that it can 'cover' the food she eats (and with dose adjusted based on how much carbs and protein she eats).She should go back to her doctor complaining of the high PP blood sugars and be prescribed this additional insulin (and hopefully also sent to diabetes educator so she can best learn how to use it).",
