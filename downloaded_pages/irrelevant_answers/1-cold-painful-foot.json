            "answer": "Do you have abnormal neurological exams? Reflexes and such? They can tell where in your body your nerve damage is by those exams. Neuropathy can come from MS but from other things such as poor circulation, diabetes, thyroid,chemotherapy, and other things. It can be the periferal nervous system or the CNS. Do you have other MS symptoms? If it is perferal it probably is not MS.Alex",

            "answer": "Hi Beth - Welcome to our group.It's important to know whether it's blood vessels or nerves that are showing signs of damage. If it is blood vessels then it's not MS. MS attacks nerves in the central nervous system.As Alex said, damaged blood vessels can cause neuropathy (unexpalined nerve pain), as can things like migraine and diabetes.Kyle",

            "answer": "I have an abnormal EMG from years ago. I don't really remember which area the trouble was in. I've had serious migraines since I was 20, but never had my first MRI until 2004 I believe. That's when I only had three sclerotic veins. I truthfully don't know the symptoms of MS. I never looked it up for fear I'd start showing symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for responding.Beth",

            "answer": "Hi -MS is not in anyway connected to sclerotic veins. I would discuss this with your GP/PCP. All of the symptoms you describe can be related to circulation. It may be helpful to see a cardiologist rather than a neurologist.Kyle",

    "question": "I have numerous sclerotic veins. First MRI showed three, then a new one said several new ones in the frontal lobe. My Neurologist does not say that I have MS for a lack of symptoms. Just recently I have started having what I thought was just cold feet that hurt. Well it keeps me semi awake. Today I gave up after just three hours of tossing and realized that only my Right foot was cold. I have back problems so maybe it's associated with that. I hope that I'm not starting to show the symptoms of MS because my Neuro seems adamant that my veins are associated with my headaches or vice versa. Sorry to babble on. I wish the best to everyone.Beth",
