            "answer": "Hi Dale,The pain is likely related to your recent activity if it is muscular(not shooting, burning,numbness or tingling nerve-type pain).\u00a0\u00a0If the Actos was started around the time of the muscle pains, then you should contact your doctor to determine if this is a side effect. Either way, if the pain continues after a few days, or worsens, or is associated with any weakness, please contact a doctor to be seen as soon as possible.Take care.",
