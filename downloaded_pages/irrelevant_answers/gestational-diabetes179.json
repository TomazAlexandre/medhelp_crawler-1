            "answer": "I have gestational diabetes too and after meeting with a dietician its really not as bad and scary as it sounds :). She helped me understand how it affects not only me but also my baby and she also helped me with a meal plan. Watch your carbs!!! Sugar is important too but what you need to look at when preparing a meal is the total carbohydrates. I have to check my sugar level four times a day. I am allowed three main course meals and three snacks in between including a bedtime snack. For breakfast no more than 25 total carbohydrates so I usually have two eggs, a piece of whole wheat toast, and three pieces of turkey sausage. For snacks I can have up to 30 total carbohydrates and for snacks I usually have granola bars and a Clementine or a Greek yogurt. For lunch and dinner I can have up to 45. So far this plan has worked for me and has kept my sugar levels low and great! Avoid having milk and fruit for breakfast because they contain sugar. No juice or pop or flavored coffees with a ton of sugar. I have stuck with water and propel when I need some flavor lol. If I can help you with anything else don't hesitate to message me! :) good luck hun and everything will be fine! Im 38 weeks and doing great along with my baby boy\u2661",
