            "answer": "It's possible for a young person to have a hole in their heart but most often it's repaired when they're an infant.Heart attacks are most often caused by fatty buildups in the blood vessels but if he has a heart problem,\u00a0\u00a0an MI could have been caused by a blood clot. Unless you're with him every day, he could have had hospital treatment and not announced it to the world.Diabetes and blood pressure - also possible. High BP would be a little odd unless he's African American or again, has a heart problem.No immune system? A person that has no immune system usually has to live in a \"bubble\" as they call it. They can't walk freely around town because any little virus could make them deathly ill.If he truly has all the problems you've listed, I think it would be noticeable in terms of his energy levels, taking medications often and dietary restrictions.",

            "answer": "I'm sorry to say it sounds like he needs attention. No reason to be angry with him, just don't get drawn into the drama. Try to divert his attention to the fun you two can have together rather than medical disasters.I'm getting old and it's typical for us old folks to talk about our aches and pains. But someone his age should be having as much fun as possible.",

        {
            "answer": "I totally agree, he is more than likely playing on your sympathies. Most kids his age who have severe medical issues don't broadcast them; they are too busy trying to be like everyone else. They want to be a part of the crowd. The last thing they want to do is stand out. My own daughter had several medical problems, everything from Juvenile Rheumatoid arthritis to a transpanted heart, Bleeding disorders which caused a stroke, kidney problems and several other issues. She didn't want ANYONE to know when she was a teen-ager and she spent\u00a0\u00a0A LOT of time in the hospital. This boy sounds like he needs an ear to listen. to him. Just be a friend and maybe he will learn to trust you to the point of coming around and being honest with you.",
