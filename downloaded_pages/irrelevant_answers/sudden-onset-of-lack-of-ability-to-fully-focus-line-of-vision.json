            "answer": "You need an appointment with an opthamologist and NOT an optomistrist. You are experience a palsy of the cranial nerves, which is common with diabetics. That is the most likely etiology. Get an hba1c.\u00a0\u00a0You need a consult with an endochronologist. It is not \"eye strain\".",

            "answer": "Having read your symptoms about your vision makes me wonder if your sugar levels were too high at that time.High sugar levels can make the vision foggy and no strength of glasses will make you see better.You do require to be seen by a specialist who checks the back of the eye for any damage by diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0A photograph is taken to view inside the eye and the retina and any damage will be spotted.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetic retinopathy can cause blindness.Having your eyes tested for vision is not the same test as you would get from a specialist to check for any damage to the eyes as a consequence of having diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Having diabetes puts you at risk of getting diabetic retinopathy and having a regular check up for this is important.Cutting down or stopping smoking would also be in your best health interests.\u00a0\u00a0Cigarettes contain 92 carcinogens and smoking also depletes your body of oxygen.\u00a0\u00a0Smoking with diabetes also puts your health at more risk from getting serious problems due to poor circulation, gangrene and amputation.If you feel sensations of pins and needles and numbness in any parts of your body and especially your hands and legs, then you already have peripheral nerve damage which will be due to the diabetes.Cold feet usually indicate poor circulation.You do not say in which country you live.\u00a0\u00a0In the UK, the doctor refers you to an optician to carry out the diabetic eye check up (not all opticians do this).\u00a0\u00a0If there is any detection of a problem, you are then referred to the eye specialist at the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0Just to remind you that a check up for your vision is not the same as having your eyes checked out for any diabetic related damage.",

            "answer": "I am concerned about the pain when you apply pressure. A neurological consult and an MRI would probably be in order as well. While it is possible this is age-related, I suspect otherwise. An optician is not appropriate for consultation.",

    "question": "First of all, I must say that I am 53 years old, type II diabetic with good control and a smoker. The problems I am experiencing may be age related. However, reassurance would be great. Three days ago, I woke up with the lack of ability to fully focus my field of vision, When I look up or down everything seems to swim and am unable to fully judge distance. While looking straight ahead , there seems to be no problem. It just so happens that it was time for my yearly eye exam and had the exam that very day. I spoke with the Dr. (optometrist) and she did a thorough exam and could not give a definitive answer. My vision prescription had not changed and all the other tests she performed, I was able to pass. She stated that most likely it was eye strain from having spent a couple of days prior to extensive computer work. One day later another symptom appeared in my left eye. While rubbing my eyes I noticed my left eye experiencing pain when I applied pressure. I would like to mention here that the \"swimming\" and lack of ability to focus in all range of vision , is reminiscent of the day I awoke and I suddenly had to begin to wear reading glasses. It would great to know that what I am experiencing is an age progression and possibly time for a \"tri\" focal. Any information would be greatly appreciated as this has become a great source of worry and concern.",
