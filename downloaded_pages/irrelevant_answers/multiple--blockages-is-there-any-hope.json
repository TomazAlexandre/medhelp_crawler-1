            "answer": "You do not mention how much damage the heart attack caused, but given the fact that she retains lots of fluid indicates the the hearts pumping function is not very good.The attached picture shows a very serious situation. Given her medical history and her medical condition right now, surgery is probably out of the question. Placing of stents will be very difficult (if possible at all) with so many blockages that need to be treated.But, as for surgery, also for stenting you need to look at the whole situation and not just at the angiogram.You could also post your question in the heart disease forum for extra opinions.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Hey Ger57,Sorry I am just seeing this. The last few months have been crazy. Her EF is at 30% if that helps. She is very weak, gets short of breath easily, dizzy spells, coughing fits and her balance is off. They have decided to put in a pacemaker to speed up her heart which scares me.",

Had heart attack\u00a0\u00a03 days ago, retaining lots of fluid despite the multiple doses of lasik given daily. Heart cath showed (picture\u00a0\u00a0attached). Doctors said there is nothing they can do but give her Plavix\u00a0\u00a0and blood thinners. I just want to know if we should take her to another hospital or if it would be useless.",
