    "question": "I have been fighting a cold for the past week, and today while I was sitting in class and looking at the paper I was writing on, my vision was a little funny. It was like I couldn't focus and then I began to see swirling in the bottom and side of my left eye. Then it became hazy and I couldn't really see anything in my peripheral vision. It stopped after about a half an hour and I got a headache afterwards. Could this be a side effect of my cold or could it be something else??",
