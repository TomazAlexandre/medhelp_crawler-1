            "answer": "Welcome to our cyber family.Are you seeing a neurologist,one preferabaly one that is a ms specialist.Your current DR should have followed up with additional testing such as a c-spine mri,thoracic mri, a lumbar puncture.He should of ran test to exclude other disorders.Yes,your symptoms are suggestive of MS,but many disorders do mimic ms.Internet research can be good if you have a diagnosis,but so much of it can show to be false information.Get yourself a new DR and take the past MRI with you,make a time line and ask lots of questions.T",

Like I didnt already know that! ...\u00a0\u00a0He sent me to a local neuro that said I had Essential Tremors but wasn't interested in looking at the MRI or hearing about my other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0AHHHHHHHHHHHH! I am currently trying to get in to see a MS specialist at Vanderbilt.\u00a0\u00a0It's the closest place to where I live.\u00a0\u00a0The only test I have had done was the MRI and test to eliminate Lupus, Lyme Disease, and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Since my tremors are the most visible its what everyone focuses on. I want to give up but I know that something is causing all of this and it might not be MS, and that would be great but I would still like to know what is going on!",

    "question": "I have been have a lot of vague symptoms for the past 15 years or so.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 47 year old female. In the last 4 years I have had 2 episodes of ARDS with pneumonia, tremors in the hands, head, legs that are increasing.\u00a0\u00a0I had an MRI last year that said there were several minimal focal signal abnormalties with the white matter with a suggestion of MS.\u00a0\u00a0I have several other symptoms such as a midsection spasm that takes away my breath, trouble with balance, falling, dizziness, forgetfulness, problems concentrating, heat sensitivity, numbness in the right leg that sharp tearing pains, and the list goes on and on..Some of the symptoms come and go but the tremors, muscle aches and pains, balance and coordination and concentration problems are pretty much with me all the time.\u00a0\u00a0I am currently trying to figure out if I am just nuts or if I am just not seeing the right doctor!\u00a0\u00a0Is there any one out there that could make a suggestion as to what my next move would be as far as seeking help. Or if any of the symptoms that I have could even suggest MS or maybe something else.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried to do research on my own on the internet but with so much information out there its hard to know if what I am reading is correct or not.\u00a0\u00a0Any help is apprecitated!",
