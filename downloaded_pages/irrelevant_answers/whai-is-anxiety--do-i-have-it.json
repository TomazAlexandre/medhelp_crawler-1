            "answer": "I also have major anxiety and have had it for years. I controlled with deep breathing and talking myself down from them. I recently lost my job for no reason and am now on xanax. It helps alot. I have felt the same way the last couple of weeks but I do have faith it will get better. I don't even know if I can pay my rent and my car just died. If you need more help don't hesitate to ask. I will pray for you and I know it will get better.Peace & Love,Flutterby",

            "answer": "There are clinics to help you in your city, some charge nothing, others charge according to income.\u00a0\u00a0Some take care of all your health issues, others are strictly for mental health. Google those and go to one. I think all the ER was saying is that you need to see someone else to determine if this is anxiety, and go from there.\u00a0\u00a0If it is, you need long term care and the ER doesn't offer this. They see a lot of people just wanting drugs and they have to be careful.\u00a0\u00a0This isn't you, but they don't know that. You need to have medical help with your diabetes as well, so don't wait on this, find a clinic so you don't have to wait a long time to get in.\u00a0\u00a0Since one Ativan calms you down, I think some relaxation techniques can help you a lot.\u00a0\u00a0Deep breathing exercises, slowly in thru your nose, hold for a couple of seconds and slowly exhale through your mouth. Exercise is great for anxiety, even if just walking.\u00a0\u00a0Do things to keep your mind busy as well.\u00a0\u00a0Watch your carb and sugar intake with your diabetes, it's a lot about diet with this.\u00a0\u00a0Many people are suffering right now, so know you're not alone.\u00a0\u00a0The state of our economy alone is putting a lot of people in your shoes, so know you're not alone.\u00a0\u00a0Talk to us for support, and never give up on yourself!\u00a0\u00a0The ER is for emergencies only, and you need to be under the care of doctors.\u00a0\u00a0So, don't take this personally.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you all the best, and take care.",

            "answer": "Viddo, sounds like you had a tough year. What I think is happening to you is what we sufferrs go through all of the time. During times of great stress like you noticed last year we generally can do ok, then when the original crisis is over a flood of panic and anxiety hit us like it had been storing up. This can last, well, for a long time.The emergency room is blowing you off because they see you in black or white, is this person in immediate danger or are they not. They generally do not care how you are feeling or what symptoms you have, remember they work with car crash victims, heart attacks, blood loss etc. Things that need immediate attention, but fail miserably when it comes to the mind.We have ALL been there, read the boards. It almost seems that a right of passage for an anxiety sufferer is to visit the ER, question doctors diagnosis, and generally suffer. But its not. It may suck while you going through it but work with your diabetes, eat right, learning breathing techniques, confront and let anxiety flow through you, and put your mind in a position of healing instead of one of dying.Of course always always monitor your diabetes symptoms if they are progressing, but know panic is very powerful and can mimic the most severe symptoms and mental disorders.Good Luck",
