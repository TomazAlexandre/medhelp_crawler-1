            "answer": "Dear Speck,I am not familiar with the term \"Autonomic Decompensation Syndrome\".\u00a0\u00a0I suspect your doctor is using this term to describe a varient of \"Pure Autonomic failue (PAF)\" or \"Autonomic failure with multiple system atrophy\".\u00a0\u00a0These are the main recognized primary autonomic diseases.\u00a0\u00a0There are many secondary causes of autonomic dysfunction such as diabetes, amyloid and drugs.\u00a0\u00a0You can find further information about primary and secondary autonomic failure at www.ndrf.org.Concerning your second question- If you actually passed out it would no longer be considered a pre-syncope episode but a syncope episode.\u00a0\u00a0If you only became \"hazy\" this would be consistent with pre-syncope.",

            "answer": "I am 22 year old male. I was diagnoised with a heart murmur 2 years ago (to my surprise!) at a routine medical. I was very worried because the doctor (not my own GP) seemed quite alarmed which didnt help MY blood pressure! which he checked after he told me this!Anyway, he said go to my own GP and see what she would say. So I did that and my GP sent me to a cardiologist to do an electrocardiogram. This test confirmed a \"Systolic Murmur\". The cardiologist then sent me to get an echocardiogram.This test indicated that my heart was of \"normal structure/size and operation\" (quoting the cardiologist).What I would like to know is firstly, even though the echo proved a normal structured heart and the electrocardiogram indicated a murmur, can this condition get worse as I grow older?.Secondly, I exercise quite alot and am very fit. I sometimes (but rarely) have recorded my heart rate at 220 beats per second when I exercise really hard (I'm a swimmer). I would like to know is there anything that can make a heart murmur worse in terms of how much or how often one exercises?",

I fully understand this term.Is it possible, to very briefly lose consciousness during a pre-syncope episode? The brief period of LOC would be maybe 2 to 5 seconds and remaining either seated or laying down with feet elevated. Hope I am making myself clear. This would be differant from syncope, when a person actually passes out.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you so much, for taking the time to read my post.
