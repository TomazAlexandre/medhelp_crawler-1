            "answer": "I agree with the EMG to determine the presence of peripheral neuropathy.I would also examine for central neurologic causes.\u00a0\u00a0An MRI of the affected area can be done to exclude a disk herniation or pinched nerve that the EMG may have missed.Metabolic diseases like B12 deficiency, thyroid disease or diabetes can be considered as well, as they each can lead to some of the symptoms you describe.A referral to a neurologist at an academic medical center can be considered.\u00a0\u00a0 I would also consider a physiatry referral (rehabiliation MD) as well.These options can be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patients education only.

    "question": "i have ddd, with narrowing of left foramen (cervical) and hypertrophy of joints of luschka. my neck hurts all the time, with shooting pains/tingling/numbness on the top of my left shoulder down my left arm, all the way to my thumb. i had an emg/ncs which showed no nerve impingement. BUT when the neurologist did this, he had me bend my chin to my chest. when i do this, the tingling,pain/numbness down my arm subsides. is this why the test was negative? could i get a different reading if i held my head in the position that makes the pain and tingling ensue? holding my head up or back or to the left recreates these awful sensations. thanks!",
