            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.Your whole body vibration symptoms could be related to diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, Vitamin B complex deficiency, neurological disorder or if you are any vibration jobs (like drilling etc). Nerve studies and nerve test may be helpful to further evaluate the condition. I would recommend evaluating the possibilities here with the help of a doctor. Further referral to a neurologist or endocrinologist may be required to assess the condition. Hope this information proves helpful to you.Take Care & Regards!!!",

    "question": "I am a 47 year old woman. I am in good health. I have a very phycial job but do not feel run down because of it. In the past few months I have noticed vibrations in different parts of my body. They do not seem to happen and any special time or place. Sometimes when I am sleeping\u00a0\u00a0I will feel them in my feet. Other times just when I am sitting, walking or just standing I can feel them between my legs. They seem to have a pattern, as if they are on a timer. 3 seconds on 15 seconds off. They come and go. Day or night. Working or relaxing.\u00a0\u00a0I do not wear tight clothes and I have not had pain of any sort, at any time. I remember a few times that I have had them in my shoulders and breast. Without the presents of pain I have not remembered to talk to my doctor about them. They never seem to be happening when I go to the doctor. I am afraid that they are something I should worrie about and putting (forgetting) it off may be a really bad idea. Should I call and make a special appointment about them. Can you help ease my mind for now.",
