            "answer": "I've had some of the numbness too. It can be neurological, due to the tx drugs, but it can also be caused by blood sugar changes.I would not automatically assume this is weak nerves as your doctor has.It would depend on what else he had ruled out.What tests did he do and what questions has he asked you to arrive at his assessment?Please go in and ask for a fasting blood sugar test if this has not been done, and see if the doctor can give you a meter to monitor your blood sugars for a few days. A lot of the symptoms you've been describing can be common if the Interferon causes changes in the pancreas or creates more insulin resistance. Interferon is known to cause or bring on diebetes in the literature and warnings. Have you had any excessive thirst along with the other symptoms? Even if no always there, are there times when you crave fluids a lot, or have a lightheaded sensation with your numbness/tingling?The test you need to ask for first is a glucose tolerance test. Just testing your blood in the office, when you have not been fasting, will not tell the whole story.If you have developed blood sugar issues there are oral meds and dietary changes that would help alleviate this, and your levels could go back to normal after treatment. However you need the right testing to determine if you've developed this problem as left untreated it could spell serious issues for you.If you are just having a neurological reaction to the meds, as some do, this could clear up as well after tx. The issues here are whether your nerve sheaths are under attack by your immune system. This type issue is harder to test for as the diagnosis for MS, multiple sclerosis is not as clear cut or inexpensive to arrive at.Your tingling could also be due to changes in blood pressure or a circulatory issue. Since you did mention heart issues weeks ago we cannot rule out a connection here.However, blood sugar problems could explain ALL of your symptoms from the diarrea to the shakyness and tingling.I'm really curious as to whether your doc has ruled this out for you. I'm sadly not able to come in here every day so maybe I missed it if this had already been checked out.But if not, I;d encourage you to get on it, and if your doctor is dismissive when you bring it up I'd really encourage you to try to find a better physician.mb",

            "answer": "It thrills me to pieces to hear anybody talking about insulin resistance because it's a great way of teaching others about it....but getting a fasting blood sugar, glucose tolerance test and a glucometer is overkill.\u00a0\u00a0Especially since he'll have to pay for it.I do agree that some of his symptoms warrant checking his fasting blood sugar (because he's having nausea and that can be a symptom of high blood sugar).\u00a0\u00a0But I really doubt that the numbness and tingling are being caused by blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0It usually doesn't happen that fast.....and it would happen on both hands, not just one.\"If you are just having a neurological reaction to the meds, as some do, this could clear up as well after tx.\"-----------------------------------From my favorite side effects management handbook......PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHIES/PARESTHESIAS.....Page 96\"These effects of interferon correlate with the etiology of peripheral neuropathies, such asparesthesias. Patients with mild, acute neurotoxicity can have SEVERE and PROGRESSIVE RESIDUAL SYMPTOMS.\u00a0\u00a0In general, the length of time the patient is treated with interferon is not strongly related to neurotoxicity. More profound paresthesias occur in individuals who have received previous neurotoxic treatment. Symptoms can occur as early as 3 weeks into interferon-based treatment. These effects of interferon therapy may appear and persist months after therapy is completed or discontinued.\"http://www.projectsinknowledge.com/Init/G/1628/1628-Handbook.pdf\"The issues here are whether your nerve sheaths are under attack by your immune system. This type issue is harder to test for as the diagnosis for MS, multiple sclerosis is not as clear cut or inexpensive to arrive at.\"--------------------------------This reminds me of the time one of my friends (who's been a nurse for many years) applied for a job at a nursing home and was given a written test.\u00a0\u00a0When she read the questions, she read too much into them....and the answers seemed too simple.\u00a0\u00a0None of them sounded right.\u00a0\u00a0So she wrote her own complicated answers based on what she knew, not really on the case described.The difference is that you might be scaring somebody unnecessarily.(One of the first signs of MS is vision problems, optic neuritis, double vision, temporary blindness, etc....which he's not having.\u00a0\u00a0And tremors caused by MS do not happen while at rest).Co",

Damage to the sensory nerves is what produces the tingling....and it's associated with weakness.Interferon can cause toxicity to nerves.\u00a0\u00a0Also, smoking damages nerves and it induces blood vessels to constrict, so they don't get enough oxygen.\u00a0\u00a0So if you smoke you may want to cut down.Alpha Lipoic Acid and Thiamine (Vitamin B1) may help your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you check with your doctor to make sure it's okay before using them.Co",

            "answer": "I stand corrected, although I should have made more clear I was referring to the whole host of neurological states, using \"such as MS\" as an example and one you are correct he would not have funds to test for probably. I wasn't aware the vision problems always started first. my neurologist said they do only if the brain damage and ensuing spots of demyelinization are clustered near the optic center or nerves..I wasn't aware the glucose tolerance was that expensive, although Lord only knows where Aijeee is at.Don't you think that the weeks of weakness, diarrea they didn't help him with, nausea and heart palpattions plus lightheadness, shakingness and now tingling in extremeities could be even Type 1....he's not that old, and the INF can trigger either type. I think if he was having an autoimmune diebetes or type 1 all the symptoms could develop quickly.I think you are correct, the INF is causing the neuropathy, but the other question is via what method, via simple neuropathy of another disease.If it is simply neuropathy caused by only inflamed muscles and nerves then it could clear up later, as many of my physical therapy patients when I practiced had this happen.However if it is a serious disease brought on by the INF then he needs to know that since that is at least treatable some of the time.\u00a0\u00a0Since diebetes is up at the top of the list in the INF possible side effects, what tests would you suggest he have??If his doc just writes everything off as nothing, weak nerves, or whatever and never gets to the heart of what may be going on this will not be in Aijee's best interest.If he did have diebetes this at least could be treated, but left untreated could do him great harm.mb",
