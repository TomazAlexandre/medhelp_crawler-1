            "answer": "Some of your symptoms certainly can be diabetes. But you can't be sure without a couple of blood tests. The A1C test and Fasting Glucose or GHC test. The A1C will provide you with an average over the last 90 days and the GHC provides a current blood level.Without insurance you can still go to a pharmacy and purchase a diabetes tester called a Glucose Reader. Walgreen's has them for pretty good pricesHere's a link not sure if I can put this on here but here goes: http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/bayer-contour-usb-blood-glucose-monitoring-system/ID=prod6008536-productWithout the tests and reader you'll have a pretty tough time knowing what your levels are. The typical treatment for Type II is a wide range of medications, food changes, and exercise. That's pretty much it. Most of it will come down to what you eat, how you eat it, when you eat it, and how much of it.I've been type II for over an year now and keep mine down with a combination of medicine and food changes. Try to keep your food natural as possible. Don't eat a lot of carbs, starches, etc. Eat fruit but not too many at one time, keep the fats in check cause these won't help any.And go to the internet and search on Type II Diabetes. There are tons of great articles and books on the subject to help you through this.As to doctors. If you have no insurance, try going to a public clinic or one of those same day clinics if they have one near you. Some places also take people that have no insurance. Call around and good luck.",

    "question": "6 years ago I went to the ER because I couldn't get out of bed, my legs and hands were numb.\u00a0\u00a0They tested me for Diabetes, MS, and both resut'ls came back negative.\u00a0\u00a0They came to the conclusion I had Neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0I was unable to walk for over a year.\u00a0\u00a0Over the past few years I have regained all feelings in my hands and arms.\u00a0\u00a0My legs and thighs still tingle, but there is almost complete numbness and aches and pains in my feet.\u00a0\u00a0The past few weeks my feet and ankles (mostly the right one) are swelling with some kind of fluid also a slight purplish discoloration.\u00a0\u00a0It takes about 2 days before they completley go down.\u00a0\u00a0So my over all question is, does this sound like MS or Diabetes, or just plain old Neuropathy?\u00a0\u00a0I have no insurance at this time, but i am getting very concerned.\u00a0\u00a0So any kind of input, feed back, would be greatly appreciated. :)",
