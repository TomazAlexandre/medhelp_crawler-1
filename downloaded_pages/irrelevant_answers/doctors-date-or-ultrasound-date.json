            "answer": "Interesting. It can go either way, but here's what I can tell you. I knew for all of my children when my LMP was and so we dated from there, but my ultrasounds showed 2-3 days earlier and my OB said he does not change the EDD unless it's a week or more different and then they would use the ultraosund date. So seeing your ultrasound date puts you at 12/14 and you were guesstimating on your LMP I would say go with the 12/14 as it is an 8 day difference.You mentioned measuring 1 cm ahead of how many weeks you are - I did for all of mine, but I had BIG babies (and no diabetes either) - my oldest was 9lbs. 9 oz. 8 days past EDD, my middle one was 9lbs. 15 oz. 1 day before EDD an dmy last one was 10lbs. 4 oz. 1 day before EDD. Again I would go with the ultraosund date, but if your Dr. won't then they will do things according to the 12/22 EDD. Have you told your Dr. that you are not 100% sure of when your LMP was? Good luck with everything =)",

    "question": "My doctor is sticking with Dec 22nd 2011 as my due date because I estimated the first day of my last period was march 17,2011 (although i'm not sure) BUT my ultrasound dated December 14, 2011. Should I listen to my doctor or my ultrasound? I know neither are actually pin point accurate, but which should I count on?\u00a0\u00a0Since she says my due date is December 22 she says im about 30 weeks and 1 day, but I'm measuring 1cm ahead. Doesn't it make sense that I am actually 31 weeks and\u00a0\u00a02 days going with the December 14th due date?",
