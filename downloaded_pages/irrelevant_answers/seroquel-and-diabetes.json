            "answer": "My suggestion would be to discuss this concern with your prescriber. I am assuming your family history with your primary care provider states you have a family history of diabetes? You should not discontinue or alter your dosing regimen of Seroquel without the express consent of your prescriber.Below is the FDA information released by Astra Zeneca regarding this very issuePatients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (eg, obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.AstraZeneca remains committed to providing you with the most current product information available for the management of your patients. You may immediately review the Warnings statement about hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus in the SEROQUEL Prescribing Information by visiting the web site www.Seroquel.com. Updated package inserts containing the additional hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus information will accompany the medication in the near future and you should, of course, refer to the insert for full Prescribing Information.As always, we request that serious adverse events be reported to AstraZeneca at 1-800-236-9933.I would not be able to offer a suggestion of an alternate medication as I do not have your full health profile and I cannot diagnose. I would urge you to discuss this matter with your primary care doctor.Best of luck to you.Jennifer R RPh www.drugstore.com",
