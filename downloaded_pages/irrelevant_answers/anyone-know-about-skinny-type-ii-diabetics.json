            "answer": "\"I really can't find anything about \"normal\" weight folks with Type II\"There are many causes - hereditary, environmental, medication, an illness that damaged the pancreas, and so forth. Your glucose levels are being controlled correctly with proper nutrition, an active lifestyle and correct body weight. That's all one can ask for is to keep your glucose levels under control.If you wish to read what doctors read follow this link to JAMA (The Journal of the American Medical Association) for papers on diabetes http://tinyurl.com/6h2h6n .",

I inject insulin, several times a day, use a treadmill (living in Alaska means no sidewalks for us and I am NOT going for a walk on a dark, freezing cold road) and I ate the 'right' stuff --- and apparently it's all for nothing.\u00a0\u00a0I'm only 53 but in the last decade, I've survived death at least four times that I can remember.\u00a0\u00a0I'm glad you don't have all these whacked out symptoms; they hit me fast and hard, which is why I think I've had diabetes alot longer than anyone can prove.\u00a0\u00a0GOOD LUCK!!\u00a0\u00a0And just be glad you ARE skinny; it's one less problem you have to deal with.\u00a0\u00a0And frankly, why rant about being skinny anyway?\u00a0\u00a0THAT is something all middle-aged people want to be! :-)",

I have trouble keeping a normal weight WHILE keeping normal blood sugars... and I am a man who does not want to be \"skinny\" not only for my own, eh, \"self-image\" but mostly for my health.\u00a0\u00a0I have a lot of things in my life that I want to live for without complications and hopefully for a long time.I guess the point I was trying to make is that, for me, gaining (and maintaining) weight feels to *me* like it is similar to the struggle of 'most' Type II's with losing weight... so, that's why I was seeking out any information or support as I know my personal circumstance is unusual.'cuz no joke:\u00a0\u00a0for me it is difficult to safely consume enough calories to maintain/gain weight while also keeping a stable and 'safe' blood sugar.That's all.\u00a0\u00a0Truly.Best to you, and happy holidays, and I hope the coming year brings you health and happiness.\u00a0\u00a0Truly.",

            "answer": "Hello,it will best if you post in a new question as more people will see and answer.Were you taking insulin while you were diet and exercise?If you normally take insulin, then stopping it can mean that your body can't use the food that you eat.Losing 12 lbs in 1 month would mean that you weren't eating enough / or couldn't eat enough while maintaining 'normal' blood sugars / there was not enough insulin to allow your body to use the food you ate.What were your fasting and 2 hours after eating blood sugar with your diet and exercise?To gain weight with diabetes, one needs to eat enough and to have enough insulin. T o keep blood sugars stable one needs to follow a low carb diet.In your situation I'd recommend the book by Dr. Richard Bernstein \"Diabetes Solution\".\u00a0\u00a0It will tell you how to control your blood sugar using low carb diet and exercise, and medications (as necessary).",
