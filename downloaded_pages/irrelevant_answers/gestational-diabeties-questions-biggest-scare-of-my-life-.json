            "answer": "Really? Okay Well I guess I was just worried that if It was a sign I had it that my dr. didnt say anything to me about it. I mean he wasnt there when I went down, but he was there afterwards and asked them about me, but he also had other mom to be to take care of at their apt. So it was just the nurses pampering me. Even if I did have it I would be fine. I see everything as it happens for a reason, so if god decided to give me that during pregnancy well then oh well. lol I am just scared that the dr are missing something, I have had it happen in the past back in Wisconsin where the dr said I was fine, and I went home and ended up going to the er, due to pain where I found out that I had e colie backed up and spent three days in the hospital. I could have had very serious issues if i didn't go in the er.",

    "question": "I am 20 +4 weeks today, and I had a Dr. Apt early this morning at 8am. Because its so early I ate two pieces of Cinnamon and sugar toast and a glass of milk prior to leaving. Normally I would come back from the apt and have myself a larger breakfast, ( Eggs, pancakes, etc). So the apt went well. They told me I gained another two lbs. Baby's heartbeat is doing well, and they gave me some advice for my back pain, etc. Well I was laying on my back while the Dr. listened to the heartbeat and was checking baby's position and then immediately after that we were done with the apt and my husband and I went to the office window and spoke with the receptionist regarding our next apt. We were standing there a while because I am being referred to a phys. therapist for the back pain and they needed to call the therapy place to get everything set up. Well all of a sudden I started to getting really lightheaded, almost like an all over body numbness, and was getting really really hot. Well I started to take off my jacket, and wave my face and told my husband I feel really faint I need to sit down. Well lets just say before they could get the chair to me, I went and passed out. Thankfully my husband was there to catch me. I have gotten lightheaded before but it wasn't to the point I passed out. Well after they woke me up had me sitting in a chair, gave me apple juice and some yogurt, and water I was starting to feel a lot better. I then went home. After I got home I was still feeling really jittery and icky so i went and had a glass of orange juice and laid down. I feel great now back to my normal self. Some questions I have are Is there anyone who has gestational diabeties and what were your first signs? Second question- the nurse took my blood pressure and said it was really really low, she also took my pulse right after I woke up, I dont know if that was not normal. Friends of mine thought it was weird that they didnt mention diabeties to me. It runs in my father side of the family. Do you think it was weird for them to kinda dismiss the whole thing? My biggest scare about being pregnant is falling.. I just dont know what to do.. I am always healthy, and havent even had a lightheaded/dizzy spell in over three four weeks.",
