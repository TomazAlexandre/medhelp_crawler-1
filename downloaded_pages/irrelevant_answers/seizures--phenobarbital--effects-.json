            "answer": "Tazz has been tested for diabetes. In fact his last blood work, taken the day he had the first seizure, showed no abnormalities. He has been on phenobarbital for 10 days now and the vet says this med can cause side effects similar to what Tazz is experiencing and should go away once his body adapts. But the poor guy seems so confused and can only stand for a few seconds before falling or stumbling. I guess I am most concerned about how this affects his quality of life. Right now it seems awful to me.",

    "question": "My dog is at least 11 years old-we got him from a rescue group that did not know his exact age. He is part Basinji. He had a terrible life but became a sweet, loving, but needy companion. In Jan. while at the vet for yearly exam he had 2 seizures. The gave him Valium intravenously and kept him for several hours. When we brought him home he paced and was very anxious. Eventually settled down. A week ago he had another seizure at home. It was awful. Thrashing, convulsing, drooling, urinating, whining. Lasted at least 5 minutes. Then he tried to get up, stumbled and fell into walls, etc. When he was able, he began pacing all around the house very agitated and fearful. He finally, after about an hour, fell asleep from exhaustion and so did we. The vet put him on phenobarbital 64.8 mg, 1/2 tablet twice a day. He sleeps most of the time, has difficulty walking, weakness in his legs, trembling and very hungry and thirsty. He is a very anxious dog normally and scared of many things, especially the vet. He did like to take walks, but was scared when he saw other dogs. He doesn't want to go on walks anymore. We want to do the best thing for him but this does not seem like a good quality of life. I am really stressing over this!\u00a0\u00a0Any words of advice?",
