    "question": "I have had a neuropathy in my hands and feet for the last few years and no one can tell me why I have it.\u00a0\u00a0I have been to several neurologists already and no one has answers.If you have peripheral neuropathy and they say etiology (hope I am spelling that right) is unknown, what other causes are there?\u00a0\u00a0Could it be due to a virus like catching a cold?Also, I have tried numerous medications and they don't seem to help.
