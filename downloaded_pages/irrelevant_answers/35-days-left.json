I was just so jealous and at the time it seemed like it was such a loooooong way of for me. Now I am down to 37 days. And due to some complications my dr thinks it will be better to be induced so I probably don't even have that many.",

My only concern is that I make it to full term, but that's only 5 days away. But the longer she stays in the happier ill be. But I don't wanna be induced.",
