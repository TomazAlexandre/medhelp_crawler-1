            "answer": "I would suggest not smoking cannibus (weed). If it isn't helping you, why smoke it? Please don't get me wrong, I am a firm believer in the medicinal value of weed, but if you aren't able to tolerate the effects, then stay away from it, please.\u00a0\u00a0You also may have smoked weed that was sprayed with a pesticide. You are so young...unless you have chronic pain or cancer, don't smoke weed. Its obviously not helping you.\u00a0\u00a0And...yes...I am a mother of 2 young adults in their 20's. :)Good luck dear.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!As I understand, you gave up smoking cannabis about 2 years back.If you still have vision disturbances, then consult an eye specialist. Vision disturbances can be due to glaucoma, refractive errors (near or far sightedness), diabetes, retinal detachment, optic stroke, infection or injury to eye, migraines, floaters, brain tumors, temporal arteritis or due to bleeding into the eye. It is unlikely to be due to cannabis after so long.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
