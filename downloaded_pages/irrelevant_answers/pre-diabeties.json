            "answer": "Jeff, I am suprised that your Dr call u prediabetic. The numbers of 114 I guess are what he is talkingabout. But putting u on Actos, hum, this is a jury out on this med, haven't u heard. U love your heart, right? Don't take it. Ther is natural\u00a0\u00a0stuff like cinnimon capsules, and chromium. I take both it hasn't really helped but its only been a few weeks. Maybe u can help me I go to bed and my BS can be 125, and when I wake up its 145. dawn Phenomenon for sure. I hear people say eat a piece of high % of dark chocolate with 80% cocoa. or drink red wine, or eat Almonds. I have also heard zinc help with pre-diabetes, but I don't know howmuch is ok, maybe your Dr. friend can tell u. I think if u eat a clean healthy diet and u exercise like u do, u should be able to ward it off but weight and health are a ? with it. I was in 1973 89ls, a swimmer (racing) pre Olympic's, and a gym rat. I got a virus and 4 months later I was diagnosed with type 2, there was no teen with it in the bay area. Talk about no information or help. I went on Diabetia, and from what I hear these day it was a bad, bad medicine. I had a rollorcoaster of the next 35 yrs. They think now Byetta is there answer to my 7.0 a1c, I am scared of it...I wish u luck, I sure hope u stay away from that Actos....Debbie",

            "answer": "That was an oops post. Fulmer - your A1c looks great and so do your fasting glucose. What are you doing between 7 and 10am? Exercising? When you reach a fasting 110 glucose reading most doctors will consider this state pre-diabetic. Fasting means no food or colored liquid 12 hours prior to testing. Are you saying you refused to take Actos?\"If one is insulin resitsant maybe that would cause a higher am reading.\" Makes no sense. If you're insulin resistant, you're going to be resistant no matter what time of day it is.I consume ALA too. It helps promote the growth of healthy liver cells and recirculation of vit C & E. I also consume NAC (N-Acytel Cysteine) for liver health.\u00a0\u00a0I do this because I am a liver transplant survivor.If your buddy is your Internist, why are you doubting him?",

    "question": "I'm a 37 year old male. I am an avid runner. I run 8 -10 miles six days a week. I run half and full marathons. I'm not overweight. 6'4 and 190 pounds. My concern is my fasting glucose. Over the past 7 years my fastings have been as low as 90 and as high as 114. My a1c has always been 5.5. The range at my internist office is 4.8-6.3. I feel like I have the dawn phenomenon going on. If you check my fasting at 7am it is usually 99-110. But if you check it at 10am it is usually 95-99. My 2 hour post meal readings are usually 80-110. I have some medical knowledge-biology major-so I understand insulin resistance. My internist is a very close friend and he mentioned me taking actos due to the fact that I'm \"Pre_Diabetic\". I refused too. My numbers seem to have been the same for the past 7-10 years. What is your opinion. Many runners do experience a higher fasting due to the fact that the liver is having to send out extra glycogen at night to keep the body in check. If one is insulin resitsant maybe that would cause a higher am reading. Cromium and alpha lipoic acid really seem to help me. thanks, jeff",
