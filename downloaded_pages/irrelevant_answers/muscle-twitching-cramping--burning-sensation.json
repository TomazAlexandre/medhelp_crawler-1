            "answer": "It is unlikely to be a parathyroid issue this far out from surgery, but checking PTH and calcium is appropriate (seems like calcium was normal at the time you presented to the ER w/ the symptoms, so less likely a calcium/parathyroid problem).\u00a0\u00a0Would also test thyroid levels to make sure these are normal.\u00a0\u00a0If symptoms persist, consider a neurological evaluation.",

    "question": "I had a TT last year, (1/13/2009) I never had muscle cramping and muscle twitching before the surgery but since the surgery it's been a bit troublesome. I've been on Calcium & Vitamin D supplements since last year.For the past couple of days I've been having leg cramps. Last night, I took a calcium supplement, 1200 iu, and almost a minute later, I felt a burning sensation all throughout my legs, it felt like my legs were on fire it was so bad, I've never felt this before, ever, especially after taking my calcium supplement. I just came back from the ER and they ran a bunch of tests, calcium, magnesium, potassium, etc etc everything came back normal. I was tested for Diabetes also, normal. I took an xray because I was having lower back pain, and I thought maybe\u00a0\u00a0I have some nerve damage..again, normal. But I feel the burning sensation throughout my back as well and my palms and feet start to get sweaty.The ER dr said that he suspects its just muscle cramping and it has to do with my PTH. I took my PTH today but it won't be in for a couple weeks. Is this normal? it's so bothersome and it's driving me crazy.",
