    "question": "I am 17 years old and for the last 4 years I have had almost constant light headedness day after day.I have seen many doctors and naturopath's but nobody can seem to pinpoint the problem! I have dreams and ambitions like any teenager and just want my normal life back.I was diagnosed with anxiety 4 years ago but just recently told that is not the cause of my lightheadedness though no one will tell me what is! Im going insane and cant go on like this !I have had a CT scan and numerous blood tests for tumors and diabetes etc but all come back fine!I'm running out of options here, it is more of an outer body feeling rather than dizzyness.any help would be great!!!",
