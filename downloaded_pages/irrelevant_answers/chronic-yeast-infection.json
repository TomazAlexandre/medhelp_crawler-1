    "question": "I am a 29 year old married woman.\u00a0\u00a0I am diabetic and take Janumet 2x a day.\u00a0\u00a0I take birth control loestrin Fe.\u00a0\u00a0My husband and I have sex about 5-7 times a week.I have vaginal irritation and mild itching.\u00a0\u00a0It typically would arrive a few days after my period or a few days before.\u00a0\u00a0I did some research and all 3 of the mentioned above (diabetic, use of birth control and frequent sex) all could lead to yeast infections.\u00a0\u00a0So I bought over the counter remedies.\u00a0\u00a0Each time they worked... but they stopped and I went to my gyno.\u00a0\u00a0He prescribed me an oral pill to take once then again 3 days later along with a cream for immediate relief.\u00a0\u00a0There hasn't been any discharge like I hear there is supossed to be with yeast infections, but he seemed to think that's probably what it was.After taking the oral pill I didn't have symptoms for several months.\u00a0\u00a0I figured the over the counter stuff just wasn't strong enough to fully get rid of it and the pill did the trick.\u00a0\u00a0However, it came back and I refilled the prescription and used the cream again, but this time it was only minor relief.\u00a0\u00a0It has been coming and going now for a few weeks mildly.Is this a yeast infection or should I go back and talk with my dr. again?PS.\u00a0\u00a0I have been off the birth control for 3 weeks due to needing to have some blood work done checking some hormone levels.\u00a0\u00a0My husband and I have had sex a few times with a condom and it irritates it more.\u00a0\u00a0Oh, and he is healthy with no signs of infections or STD's.",
