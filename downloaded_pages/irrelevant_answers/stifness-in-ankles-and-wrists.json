    "question": "I have been experiencing stiffness in my ankles and wrists.\u00a0\u00a0It is often accompanied by pressure in the back of my neck and left ear.\u00a0\u00a0Some other muscles are affected, but not as severe.\u00a0\u00a0Can this be caused by neuropathy?\u00a0\u00a0I do at times feel a maliase that accompanies the stiffness.\u00a0\u00a0I am taking a B12 supplament (250 ug/day).\u00a0\u00a0Is this sufficient?I am wondering if this is a neurological problem or perhaps related to something else like hypertension, diabetes (I am slightly high (105) in fasting glucose).\u00a0\u00a0Also can carpal tunnel syndrome cause some of these types of symptoms in the wrist?",
