            "answer": "I am 33 weeks as well and have been experiencing the same SOB and like a tightness in my chest, almost as if I have an elephant sitting on my chest! It is VERY uncomfortable and seems to be worse when I'm laying down! My dr said it was just because my lungs are not able to expand all the way anymore because of growing baby! He recommended laying on my left side and said to keep my shoulders back to give myself as much space as possible for lung expansion or if I was standing up to make sure I was standing up as straight as possible! I just try to do deep breathing exercises and really focus on my breathing...in thru my nose, out thru my mouth! It seems to help! As for your dry mouth I'd make sure to ask your Dr to be sure it's not just dehydration and maybe get some otter pops or something cold and wet to keep your mouth from getting dry! Good luck!",
