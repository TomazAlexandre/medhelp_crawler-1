            "answer": "Hi I was too labeled with PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0I'm currently seeing a holistic MD who also told me that my estorgen and testo are high and my progesterone level is too low causing me to have heavy clotting bleeding and I'm not ovulating.\u00a0\u00a0But after a year of homeopathic, my estorgen is normal and now we're working on the other two.\u00a0\u00a0He recommended me to lose weight as well...I need to lose about 40-50 pounds to be my ideal BMI weight.I agree with StephRox13 of the food you eat.\u00a0\u00a0Also go for organics foods if you can because lately our foods are loaded with hormones and causes us to be off balanced with our hormones.\u00a0\u00a0I realized that when I saw the doc DVD of \"Food Inc.\"If you need sweets try liquid Stevia drops or packets.\u00a0\u00a0Flavored stevia drops are pretty good like rootbeer or orange.\u00a0\u00a0I tried a soda called Zevia rootbeer which was pretty good too.Right now, I'm following Suzanne Somers' eat, cheat, and melt the fat away diet book.\u00a0\u00a0She talks about imbalanced hormones.\u00a0\u00a0Go to your local library and borrow it or check it out in your local book store.\u00a0\u00a0I like fruit so I chose this diet program.\u00a0\u00a0Another one is the South Beach Diet that I did as well, that one is good too but I miss fruit, LOL!Good luck!",

    "question": "Hi everyoneMy names Shelby. I'm new and I have a question! I recently found out I have PCOS and I'm at high risk of diabetes. I need to cut out sugar and go on a low GI diet, but so far most low GI foods I've found are really complicated recipes. Does anyone else have this problem? If so, I'd love to know what you eat to stay healthy! Thanks :)",
