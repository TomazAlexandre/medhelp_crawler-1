            "answer": "Do take heart with WAK's advice.\u00a0\u00a0I'm also not a physician, but a long time diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I've had Type 1 for over 35 years and am healthy; it is likely taht you can be, too.Was your lab work evaluated by an endocrinologist or a \"general physician\"?\u00a0\u00a0An endo specializes in diabetes and sees a lot of kidney damage or kidney disease issues and can distinguish between them.\u00a0\u00a0Kidney damage could be serious; OTOH it can also be similar to \"knee damage\" when we fall & scrape our knees.\u00a0\u00a0We might be sore for a while & we might get a bruise or a scab, but the knee still does its intended function.Are you taking any blood pressure medicine?\u00a0\u00a0A diabetes specialist almost always encourages us DMers to consider taking an ACE inhibitor even with normal BP, because this class of BP meds has been shown to offer kidney protection.\u00a0\u00a0You didn't mention this in your msg, and that got methinking that perhaps you're not (yet)being followed by a specialist.Considering another pregnancy is something to discuss with your endo and a team of high-risk pregnancy specialists.\u00a0\u00a0They can discuss your unique situation and options.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you can also consider adoption as a way to expand your family.Finally, if you have serious kidney disease, dialysis may be one course of action and kidney/pancreas transplant may be another.\u00a0\u00a0As WAK suggests, as you move thru the scary first days & weeks of hearing your doc's initial words, begin to become an expert on all these matters -- visit bookstores, reputable websites, and -- importantly -- seek 2nd or 3rd medical opinions from practitioners at the best facilities you can get to.Here's a good website on kidney issues... who knows?\u00a0\u00a0There may be clinical trials going on for some new treatments in your area.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck ... and may youhave many thousands of days to help your daughter grow up.http://www.niddk.nih.gov/",

            "answer": "Thanks for your posts.\u00a0\u00a0I am on HCTZ for fluid and Altace (ACE inhibitor) for BP.\u00a0\u00a0I did a 24 hour urine catch and that is where he found the \"protein.\"\u00a0\u00a0One thing i did not understand is that...I have been spilling protein since i was still seeing my pediatric endo, when i was 15...23 now.\u00a0\u00a0And the endo acted as if it was a new occurance?\u00a0\u00a0I wanted to ask him had it gotten worse, or is it the same for that reason.\u00a0\u00a0He has given me questionable advice before.\u00a0\u00a0My OB said i did not need to have another baby, but he works with my mom(mammographer), so i think that was more to cover his head than to help me in the long run.\u00a0\u00a0My husband and I did see a high risk OB that specializes in diabetes, and he said I should be fine to have another pregnancy, but that was b4 the \"discovery\" of the protein. i dont know if he knew about it or not at the time?\u00a0\u00a0I had not had the most recent urine test at that time, that was right after i had my son.\u00a0\u00a0I have been crying and crying and i am one of those that was raised not to cry for any reason.\u00a0\u00a0In your opinion, should i wait til i see the nephrologist before i do anything like having a tubal ligation?",

            "answer": "In your situation, I would ask my endo for the printed lab reports from \"this\" visit as well as the history of reports that he has.\u00a0\u00a0Bring those with you to a nephrologist.If I were feeling as emotional as you are, I would avoid making all important and potentially irreversible decisions.\u00a0\u00a0Having a tubal is a decision that should be evaluated when you & your hubby are in a position to think thru the whole issue.\u00a0\u00a0In the short term, since you have conflicting info on the current risks to you & your potential baby, it is reasonable to avoid getting pregnant.For those of us with no children \"of our own,\" it may be easier to see the treasure you already have.\u00a0\u00a0I can certainly relate to the yearning for a child and yet I have come to understand that my stepdaughter is *my* treasure ... and that others would yearn for the relationship that we have, too.I can hear your pain and can't say anything to diminish it.\u00a0\u00a0If you find that you're really stuck in this dark, scared, depressing mood, however, you might consider finding a good counselor to help you sort out the many emotions & issues.\u00a0\u00a0Keep in touch, okay?",

    "question": "On Tuesday, April 12, i went to the doctor about my diabetes (have had Type I for 19 years) and this is the first time i have seen him since i had my son, who is now about to be 8 months old.\u00a0\u00a0He checked my urine (did a 24 hour catch, if any of you know about that?) and said i have kidney problems.\u00a0\u00a0He said i should not even think about getting pregnant again, but that he wont say \"never again\" just yet.\u00a0\u00a0I am 23 years old and my husband is 29, and we have only one son, so we are devistated.\u00a0\u00a0Dr said that within 5-10 years, 15 if i am lucky, i will be on dialysis.\u00a0\u00a0Do any of you have any information on this?\u00a0\u00a0I have looked into kidney transplants and being put on dialysis while i went through a second pregnancy, but it does not look good.\u00a0\u00a0I am really upset and scared, cause my son will only be at most 15 when i would go on dialysis, and people usually only live 10 years or so on dialysis...he would be 25 when i died and i would never see my grandchildren.\u00a0\u00a0I have been really really upset about this, and i need prayers and whatever else you can tell me.\u00a0\u00a0We have only been married a year and a half, got pregnant 3 months into marriage, son was 10 weeks preemie and now we find this out.\u00a0\u00a0Our marriage is going through the loops, so please pray for us and send me any stories you might have to give us encouragementor information.. Thanks so much to all of you!!",
