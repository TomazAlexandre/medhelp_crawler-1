            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Feeling of something stuck in the throat can be due to severe gastritis and gastric reflux. The symptoms related to gut can also be due to inflammatory bowel condition such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease, Celiac disease (gluten intolerance), lactose intolerance or IBS or irritable bowel syndrome.Since you also have night sweats apart from inflammatory bowel conditions rule out diabetes and hypothyroidism.Please consult an internal medicine specialist or a GI doctor you are with and discuss these possibilities.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "hi, i been wondering what could be wrong with me. Lately my low abdominal section has been hurting. I went to the doctor and she gave me meds for constipation. After taking the meds I don't think I'm constipated anymore but the problem still persist. I use to have a lot of foul smelling gas, but that went away 1 week ago but now my stomach just hurts now and then. I lost weight because I'm often thirsty and loss of appetite so I rather drink than eat. I been tired lately and everytime it hurts I just crawl up in the bed in a ball. The pain comes and goes. I don't know if this has to do with anything but right side of my tongue been kinda sore, and my throat always feels like it has something stuck so I can't yawn because every I try, I feel like I'm about to puke. What could be wrong?",
