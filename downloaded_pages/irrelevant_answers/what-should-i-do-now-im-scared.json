            "answer": "I was over this HIV thing, until this Doctor told me I have to take Vitamin B6 because my body its not creating enough. Low vitamin B6 its considered impaired immune function. This Doctor is driving me crazy and he wanted to take another HIV test I didn't let him. So I took my stuff, and I left crying to my house. I called my insurance company, changed my Doctor and my mother recommended me her Doctor which according to her and all her friends and my insurance he's a good Doctor. I have an appointment with him tomorrow. I will ask him to perform a physical, DNA/RNA PCR test and an HIV test. I'm so nervous, i'm a wreck!!!!",
