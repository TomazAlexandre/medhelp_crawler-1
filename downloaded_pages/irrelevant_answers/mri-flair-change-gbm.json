            "answer": "Hi!It is difficult to comment on the exact nature of the FLAIR hyper-intensities or white regions. However, the three important causes are dilatation of perivascular spaces, demyelination and reduced blood supply.These changes are seen in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or Wilson's Disease, migraine headaches, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Though they are of no immediate threat, all these causes, and the presence of ischemic changes can be a risk factor for future stroke. Hence, prevention methods should include a healthy lifestyle, and a combination of diet, exercise, and medicines. Please discuss with your treating doctors. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Can someone tell me if FLAIR and FLAIR change is always negative?\u00a0\u00a0Is FLAIR or FLAIR change ever a result of pseudo progression or edema and not growth? And can someone give me an interpretation of these radiologic findings:mass has not changed substantially since the prior study. There is extensiveabnormal FLAIR signal in the adjacent brain parenchyma. This extendssuperiorly to the vertex as well as inferiorly into the left basal gangliaand corticospinal tract, inferiorly to the level of the pons. The extent ofabnormal FLAIR signal is minimally increased since the prior study,particularly near the vertex.THX",
