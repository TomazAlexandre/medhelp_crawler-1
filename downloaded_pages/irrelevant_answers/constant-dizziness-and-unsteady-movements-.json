            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Your symptoms could be associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, poor sleep patterns, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, hyper and hypothyroidism, lupus, and Lyme\u2019s. Multiple sclerosis, Parkinsonism, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, low vitamin B12 or low vitamin D, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. and certain epilepsies too could be the cause. It could also be pinched nerves in the neck. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hi, I am a 24 year old Male. For the past 1 year I have been having problems with co-ordination between hands, legs, vision and speech. I find it hard to walk steadily for long distances.I have also started feeling motion sickness sensations, even while travelling in a car at 30kmph speeds. Also, after a train or a bus journey, I continue to feel the moving/shaking/floating feeling for atleast a few days before it subsides.For the past couple of days the symptoms have aggravated and my hands are shivering constantly, and feel numb or autonomous. I also experience abnormalities in vision, like bright spots, moving flashes, haziness, and floaters.In addition to this, I also get neck pain occasionally.Please can someone help me identify what the problem is ?? I have been to various doctors - cardiologist, ENT, neurologist but they were not able to diagnose the problem. This is becoming more and more frustrating since I am unable to perform simple day-to-day activities.",
