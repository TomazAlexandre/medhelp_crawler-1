            "answer": "Since you have a fatty liver and not fibrosis or cirrhosis then your liver is still considered healthy. I see no problem with continuing with the tramadol. Maintain a heathy low fat diet so your liver doesn't continue to become fattier or even fibrotic.You should always consult you doctor reguarding medication. This only my opinion and I am in no way a medical professional.Randy",

    "question": "I am 84 and for at least forty years have suffered from fatty liver. I drink very seldom, but have had high triglicerides for all those years.\u00a0\u00a0They are lower now, but still above normal. I was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 80.I now have spinal stenosis in several places causing moderate to severe leg pain, and have received steroid injections in all the likely places, including the sacroiliac joint, without results. .At my age, I hesitate to have back surgery, but have been able to get some relief from Tramadol, taking one or two tablets three times daily. Will this exacerbate my liver disease?This discussion is related to/posts/show/885286.",
