            "answer": "Methimazole can cause fatty liver, but this is probably only a coincidence in your case, where obesity seems to be the main cause. Methamizole can probably make existing fatty liver worse, though. If methamizole was the only cause, then fatty liver would improve after droping it.Hyperthyroidism does not cause fatty liver. Excess thyroxine actually breaks down fat, so you have fatty liver despite hyperthiroidism and not because of it. It is hypothyroidism, which can cause fatty liver, since in this case, breakdown of fat is lowered.The most often cause of fatty liver is obesity. There are several other risk factors contributing to it: alcohol, high blood presure, diabetes, high blood cholesterol etc.In fatty liver, droplets of fats are in liver cells, and causing a kind of inflammation. Raised liver enzymes are just a sign of liver damage. Fatty liver tends to cause more inflammation through time, it actually may go toward cirrhosis.Fatty liver can be IMPROVED with diet, loosing weight and taking eventual elevated blood pressure and cholesterol back to normal. DO NOT use some \"liver cleansing products\" or other remedies. You can talk with a reliable dietitian, since GRADUAL losing weight is recommended.mayoclinic.com/health/nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/DS00577/DSECTION=1",

    "question": "I am 27, started having hyperthyroidism 2 and half years ago, at that time I took Methimazole(10mg/day) to control my thyroid level. everything went fine, but for some reason, my AST/ALT level slowly went from 30/50 to 80/190 in about 1.5 year.\u00a0\u00a0My Endo doctor stopped Methimazole for me, and I went ahead did Radioiodine treatment for my hyperthyroid about 1 year ago, I am now on 125 mcg synthroid/day. My thyroid test has been normal after the Radioiodine treatment, but the ASL/ALT level does not come down, still at around 80/180 level. does not go down, does not go up either. I did lots of Liver blood tests, also liver scan, ultrasound, & liver biopsy.At end, I was told everything is normal except I have fatty liver. and they have no way to treat it, only told me to lose weight. (I am now 30 pounds overweight, I don't drink). Right now I feel fine, I don't have any symptoms from either thyroid or liver (except overweight).\u00a0\u00a0My questions are: Can Methimazole medicine cause Fatty liver ? Can thyroid problem(Hyper or Hypo) cause Fatty liver ? Is 80/180 level going to be a problem long term even I feel fine now.\u00a0\u00a0and What should I do from here ? Thanks.",
