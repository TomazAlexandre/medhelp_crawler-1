            "answer": "This is some general information from my website (www.integrativefertilitymd.com) on PCOS:PCOS can affect 5% of all women and common symptoms include irregular menstrual cycles, increased growth of hair on the body, loss of hair on the head, acne, and weight gain. Based on the 2003 ESHRE/ASRM sponsored Consensus Workshop Group, PCOS is diagnosed in women who meet two of the three following criteria: ovarian dysfunction (not ovulating regularly), hyperandrogenism (increased male type hormones on lab testing or clinically increased hair growth), or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (ovaries which show multiple small cysts on ultrasound). PCOS is a common cause of infertility and puts women at an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. There is also increased risk of insulin resistance, hypertension, and abnormalities of cholesterol and triglycerides in women with PCOS. Due to these risks, we advise our patients with PCOS to have the complete metabolic assessment with complete lipid panel testing and a two hour glucose tolerance test.I find that if you are having trouble getting pregnant, it is best to see a specialist called a Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility specialist.",

            "answer": "So from the info you have given me is sounding like i have got pcos is that your opinion?. I have only got one symptom and that is irregular periods but scan showed multipul foicals. I have been reading on the internet and some sights suggest that it is quite common for people to get multiple foicular cysts and that they normally disappear on there own. Is this Correct? or is that only relevant when you have no other symptoms. for the last two days i have had swollen sore breasts, irratable with left sided abdo pain and clear sticky discharge feel like ovulating but have been testing myself since day 6 of cycle now on day 19 and they are negative. are these common signs of ovulation or could these be symptoms of something else?",
