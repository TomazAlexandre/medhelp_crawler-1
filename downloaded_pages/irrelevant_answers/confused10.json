            "answer": "Reading your note reminds me so much of the same symptons that I have had or still have.\u00a0\u00a0I suffered from headaches every day for years.\u00a0\u00a0I was told by my primary care physician that I was actually giving myself \"Rebound\" headaches by taking over the counter meds everyday.\u00a0\u00a0It was difficult, but I stopped taking them and within three weeks the headaches had subsided.\u00a0\u00a0I am not saying that I do not still get really bad headaches, but I do not have them everyday anymore.A couple of years ago I experienced the same type of pain you are describing.\u00a0\u00a0It was all on my left side.\u00a0\u00a0I saw a Neurologist who performed an EMG and other nerve test.\u00a0\u00a0His diagnosis was Peripheal Neuropothy.\u00a0\u00a0I was then prescribed Lyrica, Xanax, Loritab and a muscle relaxer.\u00a0\u00a0I work on a computer all day and was forced to be out of work for four months due to the pain and the inability to work.\u00a0\u00a0I also see stars wen I shave under my arms or turn my neck in a certain way.\u00a0\u00a0He stated that this could be a pressed nerve.I like you had several test ran.\u00a0\u00a0Many of which were expensive and all came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0Which becomes very frustrating after a while.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that you will find a good Rhuemetologist who specializes in Fibromyalgia.\u00a0\u00a0Beleive me I feel your pain everyday and I am so sorry that you too must suffer from this disorder.\u00a0\u00a0THe most important thing you can do is try to remove some of the stress from your life and I pray that you have someone that will understand what you are going through and support you.One other thing you might try is massage it has at times given me some relief.\u00a0\u00a0I could not handle the deep tissue massage it was too painful.",

    "question": "have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia/cfs.However, there are a couple symptoms that don\u2019t seem to match with fibromyalgia/CFS. These are, my muscle pain/stiffness is always worse on the left, and with fibro, the pain is supposed to be symmetric on both sides. I also see visible snow anytime I look up, hundreds of them. I have also noticed when I move my eyes the back of my left eye hurts a great deal. And I am always thirsty. I drink water ALL THE TIME. Have been tested for diabetes and don't have it.Since late December 2007, to this day, I still have my baseline headache. I have gone to bed with the headache and woken up with the same one.(By the way, I have had a CT scan, MRI, two spinal taps and blood work, all which are normal.)",
