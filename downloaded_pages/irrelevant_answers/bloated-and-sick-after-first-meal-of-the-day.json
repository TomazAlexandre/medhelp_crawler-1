    "question": "Hello,Not matter what time I eat or what I eat as long as it's the first meal I feel pressure in my stomach and on the urge of puking.One morning tried an apple and water and about 30min later felt sickTried juiced veggies another morning and eggs and also felt sick for about 3-4hrsOnce I'm not feeling horrible, I can eat plenty the rest of the day with no problems. I've even incorporated organic veggies to my everyday diet and eat pretty healthy.Today I ate eggs/mushroom/cheese with fried onion wrapped in a tortilla and same thing, feeling on verge of puking for hours and while laying I did feel like acid coming up. I do see a naturopath as well but I don't understand what is going on its really affecting my life",
