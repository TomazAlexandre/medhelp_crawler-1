            "answer": "It is true atypical (generally not typical) antipsychotics have mood stabilization properties and many have been approved as mood stabilizers. They are used as mood stabilizers but generally one antipsychotic at a clinical dose. Most of the side effects you mentioned may or may not occur and if they do can be mitigated (such as diabetes) but tardive occurs at the rate of \"5% per person per year\" with the typicals and \"1-2.5% per person per year\" with the atypicals and \"it can be masked while it is being caused\". Those quotes came from my psychopharmocologist but rather than use a particular provider as a source go to the article on Emedicine. I would think that almost all psychiatric providers that I am aware of in using antipsychotics as mood stabilizers use one at a working dose. The risk of tardive is not a reason for people not to use antipsychotics. Its just that its safer to take one at a working dose and also that happens to be more effective as well. When I took standard antipsychotics throughout the years I was prescribed one at a standard effective dose. That seems to be general working procedure from what I know. I believe you had a referral to another psychiatrist who was willing to adjust your medication. You might want to go with that and see what they can tell you if they are more informed overall.",

            "answer": "Thank you IL. I am aware of the proper dose of one atypical only, except that i can't tolerate it this is why i am using smaller doses of each. If i take say 400 of seroquel possibly i won't get up from bed in the morning, one becomes very lithargic though not in a bad moodthanks.",

            "answer": "Hi adel.I developed sever anxiety while tapering xanax so my Pdoc started me on low dose seroquel 25 mg BD to decrease the anxiety and said that he would maintain it for a few days and then taper and stop it while tapering xanax.But tapering these Psych meds is really difficult.I know you encountered the same anxiety while tapering Stelazin.I really had no anxiety problems since 10 years before this so it is withdrwal from Risdone and Xanax which gave me this anxiety.I am no longer on Risperdal so seroquel and xanax will be next to be stopped.",

    "question": "Hi comradesA standard approach to BP is to use a mood stabilizer or a combination of them.Now, there is no strict or rigourous or clear-cut agreement about the meaning of an MS except that it's the one which regulates your mood. However you also hear - even with these MS - that people can get very depressed or become hypomanic at times. So seemingly, no general rule applies, neither there exists till now what we can call the most effective, \"safest\" mood stabilizer.Another approach, namely the one used by my original stupidely blessed pdoc is to use antipsychotics only, not only that but to mix a bunch of them typical with atypical, no problem. I thought at first that he wishes to see me die, but I resented directly this assumption because i concluded that he needs me dearly to pay him continuously. Now apart from diabetes, TD, neuroleptic....syndrome etc....how come i am surviving till now. You will tell me perhaps these symptoms will soon appear or in the future eventually even on low doses like the ones I use (25-50 seroquel, 1mg risperidone, 1mg stelazin), I agree and perhaps not and perhaps also i may switch to others one day.My daily concern was that if I don't intervene aggressively with my BP I can get worse. But i don't see myself getting worse with this stupid combo. Besides, many drug companies producing these AP's tell you they have a stabilization property even some like seroquel can be used as monotherapy drug.My question, am I the only pt taking these weird meds ?thanksezz",
