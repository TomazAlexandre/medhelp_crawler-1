            "answer": "Hello smckenn,It seems that you are having some form of antibiotics resistance. Which antibiotics you have been on? Apart from the nitrates which other drugs have you been on? Have you been diagnosed with diabetics? The chances of urinary tract infection increase multifold with the association with diabetes.Discuss this with your urologist.Best",

            "answer": "Thank you for the reply. They told me I was not diabetic. I have been on sulfamexazole and cipro. They seem to clear the UTI up at the time but then it comes back within a week or two.I kept a log of my blood sugars for a month and they basically said I had episodes, but that I was not diabetic. Is there some other test besides blood tests that would verify whether or not I am diabetic?Is it possible to have some other ailment causing this?",

    "question": "I keep getting UTI's. I'm currently on my 7th now for this year. I JUST finished a round of antibiotics a week ago and now I have another one. On Tues I saw a urologist who did an internal and urine sample and culture. He said that everything seemed normal, no cysts, no blood, no nitrates, nothing.By Thurs my back pain had become ridiculous so I went to my regular doc who said I did have some traces but that I should be fine and thought my back pain was something unrelated and sent me for xrays (which I haven't gotten the results from yet).Flash to today, Friday, I brought a sample to the urologist because I was certain the \"some traces\" had increased and I am back to having yet another UTI. (still waiting on them to call me as well).BUT, my questions are:Am I not asking the right things? I keep getting these UTI's and being told I'm just an unlucky woman isn't a good enough answer for me. What do I need to ask to get the right tests done to figure out what is going on?What else could this possibly be? I was told I do not have kidney stones...can they tell that just from urine samples and doing a culture?I started having hypoglycemic episodes a short time before I started getting UTI's, is it related? The urologist I saw seemed to think there was no correlation...but it seemed odd that 6 months ago I was totally healthy and fine and then BAM episodes and reoccurring UTI's.Thank you so much for the help. I just can't handle being sick like this all the time. I can't keep going to the doctor all the time and being sent away with no answers.",
