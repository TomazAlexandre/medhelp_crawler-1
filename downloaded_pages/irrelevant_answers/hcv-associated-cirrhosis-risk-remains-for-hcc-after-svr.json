    "question": "\"Patients With HCV-Associated Cirrhosis Remain at Risk for Developing HCC After Achieving SVR\"Source: 2013 Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases*Date posted: 11/6/2013Meta-analysis of previously reported cohort studies[1]Summary of Key Conclusions:* Annual risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) approximately 1% in patients with HCV-induced cirrhosis who have attained SVR* Risk increased with advanced age, more severe liver disease, and diabetes* A population aging with chronic HCV infection and more effective antiviral regimens likely to result in an increased HCC incidence* Authors suggest screening all cirrhotic patients who attain SVR for HCC until more risk stratification tools become availableSummary of Study Design* Meta-analysis of individual patient data from 10 cohort studies conducted in Europe and Canada* Eligible studies included consecutive patients chronically infected with HCV with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis who attained SVR on interferon-based regimens* Studies with HIV or HBV coinfection excluded* Individual patient data excluded if developed HCC prior to start of follow-up (24 weeks post\u2013antiviral therapy cessation)* Kaplan-Meier analysis used to estimate cumulative HCC rates* Differences between subgroups compared using log-rank testMain Findings:* 51 of 1000 patients (5.1%) developed HCC over median follow-up of 5.7 years (IQR: 2.9-8.0)* Sex: no effect on rate of HCC (P = .474)* Rate of HCC higher among patients with cirrhosis vs those with advanced fibrosis (P = .064)* Older age significantly associated with greater cumulative rate of HCC in cirrhotic patients (P = .006)HCC diagnosed in 3 patients with bridging fibrosis* All patients had low platelet counts (\u2264 166 platelets/mm3)2 laboratory markers associated with HCC occurrence:* Platelet count < 150,000 cells/mm3 (vs \u2265 150,000 cells/mm3) (P = .045)* AST/ALT ratio \u2265 0.90 (P = .017)* Factors independently associated with increased risk of developing HCC post-SVR included advanced age, low platelet count, and presence of diabetesHector",
