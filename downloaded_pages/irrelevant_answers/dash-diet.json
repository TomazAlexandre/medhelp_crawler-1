            "answer": "Basically, it looks like a basic diet that everyone agrees is the best way to eat.\u00a0\u00a0I can see a couple of things to watch out for -- it relies a lot on dairy, and the vast majority of humans don't have the ability to digest it so that could be a problem, but you can avoid it by just avoiding most of the dairy.\u00a0\u00a0It also is a very low fat diet, including the \"good\" fats, so that could also be a problem.\u00a0\u00a0Because you exercise quite a bit, you need more sodium than someone who doesn't, so be wary of that part of it.\u00a0\u00a0But this is what long-term studies that follow the healthiest people have been saying forever -- the best diet is composed of whole grains, not getting your protein from red meat, not overdosing on sugar and salt, eating your fruits and veggies.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing new here.\u00a0\u00a0You'll need more calories, though, again, because you exercise a lot.",
