            "answer": "My Max had pancreatitis 4 years ago and I recall his stomach was distended.\u00a0\u00a0I think that the bowels moving is a good sign.\u00a0\u00a0If you are concerned, you can call the emergency vet and ask about it; sometimes they will provide information over the phone.One thing I should mention, pancreatitis can be a precursor to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0A year later, max developed diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0(We manage it very well with diet and Vetsulin but it takes dedication, a rigid feeding schedule and 2 shots a day.)\u00a0\u00a0Keep an eye out for the symptoms once your pal is well.\u00a0\u00a0Early symptoms include increased drinking, iurinating more (accidents may be a sign), weight loss, increased appetite, dehydration and sudden cataract formation. Symptoms of more advanced diabetes should be treated immediately and include the above symptoms plus depression, weakness, vomiting, rapid breathing, and an acetone odor on the breath.",

            "answer": "Your dog is so lucky to be recovering already.\u00a0\u00a0Pancreatitis is a horribly painful condition and the nausea is tremendous.\u00a0\u00a0If he's already eating and keeping it down, he's definitely moving in the right direction.\u00a0\u00a0As long as he IS having bowel movements, don't worry about a bit of bloat.\u00a0\u00a0His entire system is in an uproar and he probably isn't yet producing all the digestive enzymes needed to properly digest solid food.\u00a0\u00a0It may well be only gas.Don't forget that you can call the ER vet and ask this question without being charged.\u00a0\u00a0I've found such facilities very helpful for numerous questions when my own vet was unavailable.I've had plent of barium down the throat and up the exit ramp as well, and the formulas used now are so much better than they were even 15 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0They pass through much faster and the obstruction issues aren't nearly as bad.\u00a0\u00a0As long as your pup is drinking plenty of water, the barium shouldn't cause any trouble.Since the pancreas is a VERY picky organ, don't be surprised if your dog has ongoing digestive problems for some time.\u00a0\u00a0He may have to be on a prescription or bland diet for the rest of his life.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes should only be an issue if he develops chronic pancreatitis for a very long time.\u00a0\u00a0Eventually enough islet cells are damaged that insulin can no longer be produced.\u00a0\u00a0I doubt that has happened yet with such a fast recovery, and it may never happen.My aunt had a mini schnauzer who lived over 18 years, and most of those years included chronic pancreatitis with a few acute attacks requiring hospitalization.\u00a0\u00a0Apparently pancreatitis is a big genetic problem with that breed now.\u00a0\u00a0Don't despair!\u00a0\u00a0Things are looking good for you both right now.\u00a0\u00a0:-)",

            "answer": "Thanks for the information.\u00a0\u00a0Duke's stomach has gone down quite a bit.\u00a0\u00a0He is 14 but looks and acts 7.\u00a0\u00a0He is doing great, hungry more than normal but he was NPO for 48 hours and I believe he is filling his stomach again, plus, he is on a bland diet and chicken and rice doesn't fill much.\u00a0\u00a0Do you think it would be OK to give him plain grits?That is very bland and I am trying to think of something else to feed him.\u00a0\u00a0Thanksleanne928",

            "answer": "Hi leeanne.\u00a0\u00a0:-)\u00a0\u00a0I lost my first dog to pancreatitis when he was almost 14.\u00a0\u00a0He was NPO for the last 3 weeks of his life.\u00a0\u00a0After the first week, he seemed well enough to try plain chicken and rice and he really enjoyed it.\u00a0\u00a0Little did we know it was his last meal.\u00a0\u00a0The next day he was right back to barfing everything - including water.\u00a0\u00a0We took him to a specialist hospital where he had the same treatment in ICU as a human with pancreatitis.\u00a0\u00a0He had a central line placed in his neck so he didn't have to get stuck with needles all the time, and was put on TPN - nutrition given via IV.\u00a0\u00a0He also had a ton of pain meds - a 75 mcg fentanyl patch along with injections of dilaudid for breakthrough pain.\u00a0\u00a0At least I know he was as comfortable as humanly possible those last couple of weeks.Anyway, the only reason I mention this story is because your dog at 14 is doing great!\u00a0\u00a0It's not easy for any dog to recover this quickly from acute pancreatitis, but for a senior dog to come out of it so well is truly remarkable!\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't push any new foods too quickly.\u00a0\u00a0His pancreas is still probably bubbling away angrily, and you don't want to aggravate it any more than necessary.Our first instinct is always to get an invalid fed well as soon as possible, but with the pancreas it's always best to go slowly.\u00a0\u00a0Duke is doing great and you don't want to risk a relapse.\u00a0\u00a0If you add anything else, I would try yogurt.\u00a0\u00a0A little Danactive would be great because it has some of the digestive enzymes produced by the pancreas that are probably not in great supply right now.\u00a0\u00a048 hours of NPO for a dog in this condition is nothing to worry about.\u00a0\u00a0Err on the side of caution and go easy on the diet no matter how hungry he tells you he is.\u00a0\u00a0Water is the most important thing right now and allowing the pancreas to rest as it heals.\u00a0\u00a0That's why the bland diet is so important at this time.\u00a0\u00a0If you go back to regular food too soon, he'll have a relapse.\u00a0\u00a0The only way to rest the pancreas is to not eat and require it to produce digestive enzymes.If your vet didn't fully explain pancreatitis to you, in a nutshell it means that the organ is digesting itself because the digestive enzymes it produces can't flow to the small intestine.\u00a0\u00a0As it becomes more and more swollen and inflamed, it can put pressure on the bile duct and then prevent bile from the liver from going to the small intestine.\u00a0\u00a0That results in jaundice and eventual liver failure.\u00a0\u00a0It is extremely important to give the pancreas time to calm down, so do your best to stick to that bland diet for now.\u00a0\u00a0Grits probably wouldn't hurt him as long as you don't include butter or salt.\u00a0\u00a0Fats in particular should be avoided.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't change anything at all until you consult with your vet.Please keep us posted on Duke's progress.\u00a0\u00a0He really is remarkable!\u00a0\u00a0:-)",

    "question": "My dog had acute pancreatitis over the weekend and I took him to an emergency vet on Sunday and to his vet on Mon. They both kept him overnight, IV, blood work, meds, and his vet did a rectal x-ray and abdominal x-ray with barium to look for obstruction.\u00a0\u00a0He found dirt/sand.\u00a0\u00a0My dog ate cat poop covered in dirt.\u00a0\u00a0He is at home now doing fine and I have him on a bland diet of canned white chicken and brown rice only.\u00a0\u00a0However, his lower abd/belly is a little distended and hard.\u00a0\u00a0Could the barium cause this?\u00a0\u00a0He is eating fine, healthy appetite and bowel movements are constitent, soft stool, not alot of it though.\u00a0\u00a0I was wondering if the barium has hardened because he hasn't passed all of it yet.\u00a0\u00a0It's the weekend, emergency calls are expensive and it doesn't seem to bother him when I press on his abdomen.\u00a0\u00a0I am in the health care field and I have seen where barium has obstructed bowel in humans.\u00a0\u00a0What is your thought?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
