            "answer": "HI,I think the general information given by our member on the forum \"Mary\" is overall correct. The other thing to mention is that sometimes Type 2 can be managed quite well on oral medications and never require insulin, whereas some require insulin form the start. Each individual is quite different,as can be their diabetes course.In regard\u00a0\u00a0to supplements, because the diseases are quite different especially at the start, it is not likely that any supplements will work for both. I am not sure what you refer to as \"supplements\"--I assumed herbal medications and vitamins. There is not a great deal of good study data backing any of those medications for either type of diabetes. Cinammon showed some promise but that is now in question again after a study released late last year. Chromium is being formally studied and I know there are some studies coming out of the east in regard to ginseng. But right now none are formally well accepted in the medical field.Hope this helps.Take care.",

            "answer": "Type 1 diabetes is considered an autoimmune disease; the body's immune system attacks the islet cells in the pancreas, which produce insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Eventually all the islet cells die, and all of the body's insulin needs must come from injections or a pump.\u00a0\u00a0When caught early, there may be some residual insulin production left ... there have been some studies trying to preserve some insulin function in Type 1 diabetics, but I don't think they've been successful.Type 2 diabetics do not have their islet cells destroyed by the body.\u00a0\u00a0They often have insulin resistance which means their muscles can't use insulin effectively.\u00a0\u00a0Often they are overweight which puts a burden on their pancreas to supply enough insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise can improve how their muscles handle insulin, so that is VERY helpful.\u00a0\u00a0Losing weight lowers the amount of insulin required by the body, so that can be helpful.\u00a0\u00a0If the Type 2 diabetes is ignored, the islet cells eventually may eventually put out very little insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Then insulin by injection or a pump is required.Both my grandmothers were type 2 diabetics, both overweight.\u00a0\u00a0One eventually required insulin injections, and the other did not.\u00a0\u00a0The one who didn't need insulin used pills instead, and watched her diet a little better than the other.My forensics coach in high school became a type 2 diabetic; he didn't believe his doctors when they told him to make healthy changes to protect his circulation, his kidneys and his heart.\u00a0\u00a0So he ignored the advice and ate what he wanted.\u00a0\u00a0The last time I talked to him, he was having trouble with his eyes and his legs (poor circulation).\u00a0\u00a0I haven't talked to him for several years, so I hope he modified some habits to help his body heal.I am diabetic from cystic fibrosis - a mixture of type 1 and type 2.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise helps me greatly.\u00a0\u00a0I avoid rice - that's a problem food for me.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if cinnamon helps or not.\u00a0\u00a0I can't use pills, I use insulin.\u00a0\u00a0I measure my blood sugars often, but I use my forearm instead of my fingers - it doesn't hurt on my arm, but my fingers hurt a lot.\u00a0\u00a0I give myself food breaks sometimes - at holidays - but I try to watch my diet most of the time.\u00a0\u00a0After all, I want to live for a long time, but I also want to be healthy so my life is more enjoyable.I am not a doctor; I'm an electrical engineer.\u00a0\u00a0So I think what I've written is true, but read on the internet and talk to your doctor - and if you don't get good answers, ask another doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Information is very important.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",
