            "answer": "Hello AOK,Looks like we overlooked yoru question the other; I apologize for that.\u00a0\u00a0As you may know we're all volunteers here and not medical professionals.Seems that -- as you say, you're feelin' pretty okay, except when you drink alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0You report taht you suffer from severe hangoves and other negative things when drinking alcohol.As a fellow human being, I'd encourage you to stare down your reflection in the mirror to ascertain whether you, in fact, are exhibiting signs of alcoholism -- and if so, to find the courage to reach out to AA for support & encouragement on a road to recovery.Alcohol is a depressant even when not abused.\u00a0\u00a0When we abuse alcohol, our whole system is affected in complicated ways that don't get better by ignoring them... and an otherwise healthy 25-year old can begin to feel and behave as if he were much older.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone close to you has ever expressed concern over your drinking behaviors, I'd encourage you to visit the AA site to help you assess things:www.alcoholics-anonymous.orgI hope this information has been helpful; and if you have lingering concerns do check in with your doc and/or seek a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Most adults are self-aware enough to know when \"things just aren't right\" even if we don't know what, in particular, is ailing us.Good luck",

            "answer": "Actually, it looks like you may have overlooked my symptoms, not my question.\u00a0\u00a0The fact that I mention alcohol in my post, was not the highlight of my symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I don't believe it to be related, but I was attempting to cover all bases to potentially highlight some key points that may be related to a liver condition or even diabetic symptoms.Just so we don't judge my habits, let me at least provide some details to calm your concerns.\u00a0\u00a0I drink alcohol at a moderate pace 1 to 2 times a week.\u00a0\u00a0A couple of drinks on a Friday/Saturday night or potentially a night out on the town.\u00a0\u00a0Of which all are normal activities for someone in my age group...if someone thinks otherwise, then I would be afraid 99% of my peers would be diagnosed alcoholics and AA would be overwhelmed with new members.\u00a0\u00a0If that doesn't help, hopefully this will, I just spent 6 months in a harsh environment without any alcoholic beverages and I still had every symptom previously listed.So as mentioned before, I'd like to get back to my real symptoms, which personally I've checked off plenty more blocks on the potential liver conditions or diabetic lists than anything I've ever studying regarding alcoholism.I will see a doctor in person, but I thought I'd go in with some knowledge on my own to prevent any suprises.\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts now?",

            "answer": "Thanks Andrew, I was hoping I wasn't way off base in thinking that the focus on the alcohol was not my point.\u00a0\u00a0I do think I will watch this more closely.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor in the past has asked about diabetes, but I guess nothing in my blood work has shown to be worrisom.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate your input and reference, at least I may be on the right track, even if it turns out to be something else.",

            "answer": "Hi AOKI am 27. I too feel as though your problem may have been mispresented.Since the age of 25, I too was suffering from the symptoms you describe. I lost weight, had skin conditions, developed thrush, suffered immense fatigue and the hangovers got much much worse (far worse than anyone else in my age bracket). This all happened all over a period of 2 years on and off.I feel as though I was in a pre-diabetes phase, and was eventually dxd with Type 1 diabetes last September. Since starting insulin I have more energy, feel healthier, and the hangovers aren't as bad! I would therefore recommend that you get tested, monitor your gluocse levels closely, and see a doctor who is well used to diabetes.By the way, I agree with your analysis of alcohol. At the age of 25, and working in the city of London, providing you take care of yourself and understand your body and its carbohydrate and insulin needs, there is no reason why you shouldn't enjoy a drink whenever you want - everyone else our age does, and I am convinced that diabetes won't alter that for me! Everything in moderation hey, and sensible eating and a good insulin regime. Don't let the suckers get you down!Good luck.",

            "answer": "I was diagnosed as type 1 after being found in a DKA induced coma last September at age 29. In the few weeks before, I experienced many of the symptoms you describe. I had frequent urination and sometimes almost uncontrolable hunger. I lost about 30 pounds in a short period of time, and at one point, after grocery shopping, had to put one of the two bags down in my entry way because I didn't have the strength to cary both of them the 20 feet to my kitchen.I also had some other symptoms you may want to keep a look out for. My urine had a strange odor to it, I had rapid eyesight change, I was extremely thirsty, and I often felt kinda down. I also had a few bouts of what I assumed was a nasty flu, but was in fact the beginings of the ketoacidosys. I didn't have any skin issues, and I've never been a big drinker so I didn't notice any hangovers.Trust me, it's a lot easier to talk to your doctor now then to not remember the better part of a week and wake up in restraints in the ICU of your local hospital with the doctors asking you if you know what day of the week it is.",
