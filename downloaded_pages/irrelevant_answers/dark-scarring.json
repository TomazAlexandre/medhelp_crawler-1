            "answer": "Hello,This scarring is due to post inflammatory hyperpigmentation after the cuts. Without treatment, this usually takes about 6 months to resolve and for the skin color to go back to its normal color.\u00a0\u00a0Topical treatments with acids and chemical peels can be effective but can take a while for the skin to totally revert to its normal color.\u00a0\u00a0Microdermabrasion can also be done, but this might require several sessions.\u00a0\u00a0Skin resurfacing using lasers is also an option.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Within the last year or so any cut that I get takes a while to heal and when it eventually does heal, they leave dark and slightly raised scars. Could this be a sign of diabetes or is it just a skin condition?",
