            "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your loss. I would recommend that you see a specialist in recurrent pregnancy loss like a reproductive endocrinologist to find out why you are miscarrying.In general, the workup can be the following:Recurrent pregnancy loss can be attributed to many different causes. These causes include: genetic factors (e.g. abnormal fetal chromosomes, abnormal parental chromosomes); anatomic factors (e.g. structural abnormalities of the uterus such as scar tissue in the uterus, or congenital abnormalities of the uterus such as septate uterus); metabolic factors (e.g. diabetes); endocrine factors (e.g. abnormal thyroid, PCOS, diminished ovarian reserve); infectious factors (e.g. chlamydia, mycoplasma, ureaplasma); thrombotic factors (e.g. inherited thrombophilias); immunologic factors (e.g. anticardiolipin antibodies, autoimmune disorders, increased natural killer cell activity); male factors (e.g. sperm DNA fragmentation); and environmental factors (e.g. exposure to environmental toxins).I wish you the best.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your response. I did ask my OB if I needed extra care because I was carrying multiples and because of my history. She said no because all seemed to being going well in the middle of the first trimeseter. However, I was spotting from the time I found out I was pregnant 5weeks until 6.5 weeks then it started again at 7weeks and ended at 8 weeks and started again at 11ws5d which resulted in a miscarriage. I do conceive naturally. I do plan on seeking a specialists opinions",

    "question": "I am a 27 year old African American woman married with an 8 year old daughter my husband and I have been trying to conceive another child since 2005. In the summer of 2005 I found out I was pregnant. However this pregnancy was a blighted ovum and I had a D&C. I found out I was pregnant again in late fall of 2005. I had vaginal bleeding early on in the pregnancy. I thought this was strange because I never had this with my daughter. Anyhow I found that the baby was growing as it should and had a healthy heart beat, but I lost that baby at 14wks, my water broke and the baby was coming out feet first. I had a D&C as well. Tests were done on the baby and he was developing normally.\u00a0\u00a0I asked my doctor what could have caused this however she was unsure and felt that I could get pregnant again successfully. I became pregnant again this year 2007 in late August. Shortly after I found out I started to bleed again. I got blood work done and had ultrasounds which revealed I was carry twins. Well my husband and I were so excited. On November 17th I began to bleed lightly the bleeding increased over a day with clots. I went to the ER because I was having severe pain and bleeding. They did blood work and an ultrasound and told me that I had miscarried. Needless to say my husband and I are very upset and don\u2019t understand why this continues to happen. Do you have any advice as to what to do and the future and what is causing this problem?Thank you for taking the time to read and answer this.",
