            "answer": "maybe his manner is due to coming this new baby. and the other point that you should pay attention is that this age specially in boys is the starting of ignoring and obstinacy. this is the characteristic of this age. he is in this manner from a longer time maybe because the new baby has attracted all attentions even before coming.I think you should visit a psychologist for this assumption. he should be checked by interview and drawing tests.let me know about him.",

    "question": "I am concerned with my son. He is 3 years old. He has gotten to the point that day care almost kicked him out for being so mean. He is a pure out bully. I took him to the doctor and all the doctor could tell me was to read a book he suggested. My son gets to the point that i have to drag him out of places...i mean literally. He will scream like hes in intense pain but nothing has been done to him. He has been potty trained for a little while and he is going thru a stage where he will stand in front of you or the toilet and void in his pants. He is also concerning me with the possiblility of being diabetic. He is constantly thirsty, and is voiding frequently. He hasnt ever really been sick except for respiratory problems associated with having RSV really early in life. Does anyone have any advice?",
