            "answer": "Your husband need to go back to the doctor for a referral to a urologist.The sensation of burning whilst urinating can be from a bladder infection and from very acidic urine.Seeing blood in the urine in men can be from a urinary tract infection or stones and also from a prostate problem.Another reason for increase in frequency can be from the prostate gland being enlarged and also from diabetes.Get your husband to make an appointment with his doctor for a referral to a urologist, and blood tests taken to check his blood for diabetes, liver and kidney function and prostate problems.He leaking from the anus may be from diverticular disease.\u00a0\u00a0This needs looking into as well.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "My husband has been seeing a urologist. They have not found anything. They have giving him medication for urinary and bladder infections, kidneys and prostate. The only condition he has is blood pressure. His parents have diabetes. He has had sonograms, and prostate exams and nothing has been found. The only thing that makes it a little better is motrin. I think I will seek a different urologist. right now I am trying natural remedies.",
