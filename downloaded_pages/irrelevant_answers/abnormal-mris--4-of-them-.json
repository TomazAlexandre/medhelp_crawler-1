            "answer": "Hi Carla, I am new to this site too. I have been having migraines for many, many years. Since I can remember when. My Dad also suffered from severe migraines. And he died when I was 17 yrs. old from a brain anurism. But he was also an alchoholic.I think migraines run on my Dads side of the family. I know high blood pressure does, I have that too. Sometimes I get migrainies that last for days and days. And sometimes I\u00a0\u00a0have to go to the hospital or the doctor to get rid of them. I take Topamx for them too. And that seems to help allot. But there are allot of side affects with that medication too. I am from New Mexico, the desert southwest. And my neurologist wants me to go to this hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico, that is a teaching hospital, where there is a team of doctors that can do further testing and exploring on me I guess. Some scientist he says. I have has so many tests done. I am tired, know what I mean. My neurologist says he doesnt know why the white spots are there. But he thinks they are caused from my diabetes and high blood pressure.",

    "question": "I have had 4 abnormal MRIs. They found white spots or lesions in my brain.They thought i had MS. I also had a lumbar puncture, evoked potential,and a full neck and spine MRI which all came back negative for lesions and MS. Thats what I was told by my neurologist. I do also have\u00a0\u00a0Migraines, high blood pressure, Diabetes type 2 , Hypothyroidism, Fibromyalgia, and severe feet pain, and probably some nuropathy in my legs and feet. I have lots of memory loss, short term specially. I have trouble making everyday simple decisions, my speech is affected. I am fatigued constantly, tired all the time, and am afraid to go out alone. I have fallen down a couple times, but not recently. My quality of life is not good for being only 47 yrs. old. I have been told that some of the lesions or white spots have gone and some new ones have come. And I have been told that the spots are still there too. I have also been told that I do not have any autoimmune diseases. I feel like i am going crazy! What could possible be worng with me? Could I still have MS? Or maybe something else? I have had so many tests done and no one seems to know what wrong with me! Can you help me???",
