            "answer": "Hi!Well, your doctor has kept the hydrocodone dose the same and cut back on acetaminophen dose. If this has increased your pain, you can ask her the reason for the cut back. Maybe you will be put back on the original dose or some other pain medication combination could be tried. You could also take up swimming (if allowed), yoga, physiotherapy and exercises. All these will also help bring some pain relief. Good diabetes control is also very important and swimming along with diet control and medication can help you a lot. Please talk to your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "akpain, I'm sorry your feeling pretty bad. The only difference in your medication is that it has less Tylenol than before. This strength has actually been discontinued because of the liver toxicity. I'm surprised the Doctor who posted above me didn't already know that. ??Best of luck to you.",

Not good for your liver.I am on Neurontin/Gabapentin and that seems to help me a lot, have you considered these medications? They help a lot more with this kind of pain.I am also on morphine and a variety of other meds (spinal cord injury) and those don't help for that kind of pain.You may want to speak to your doctor about the neuropathic pain specifically, they have new meds about there.I am also on a medication called Mobic.",
