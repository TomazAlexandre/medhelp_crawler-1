I did that with my first pregnancy and constantly had high blood pressure, head aches, tummy aches, swelling, and gained 33 pounds. With this second baby i still crave the chocolate, fast food, etc..but I'm just too afraid to touch it. It's working so far. I'm 22 weeks and only gained 3 pounds. But as long as your drinking juice, plenty of water, doing some light exercise, and taking your prenatals then i think you'll be fine. Just don't over do it, as fun as it is lol",
