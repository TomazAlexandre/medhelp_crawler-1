            "answer": "Hi BrianBe persistent. I know that's hard to do when you don't feel well, but with HMO's and Insurance companies having more to say these days about medical diagnoses and how much \"face time\" you get to spend with your doctor than your doctor does, you have absolutely NO CHOICE but to be a very squeaky wheel.\u00a0\u00a0PESTER PESTER PESTER PESTER PESTER until you become SO MUCH of a PAIN IN THE BUTT that it is easier for them to finally give you some attention than to brush you off and move on to the next numbered chart...er I mean patient.\u00a0\u00a0\"For-profit medicine\" is the worst thing to ever happen to patients AND doctors in this nation, as both face nothing now but frustration and failure in delivery of care as the norm, with good care being the EXCEPTION of the day.\u00a0\u00a0If you have PPO insurance, see a specialist in a big city, preferably at a large teaching hospital.\u00a0\u00a0They are more \"up\" on new diagnostic techniques and have curious students more likely to have at least SOME time and SOME interest in finding out what is wrong with you.I'd be interested in seeing what an MRI of your cervical spine looks like, whether you've been tested for Lyme disease and what kind of shape your sinuses and ears are in physically and infection wise.\u00a0\u00a0You may have more than one process going on.NO DOCTOR SHOULD EVER LAUGH AT YOU FOR ANYTHING!It is inappropriate, unprofessional and inexcusable.\u00a0\u00a0A letter to your state medical board would be in order, giving details of the interaction.\u00a0\u00a0It may not do you any personal good, but if all patients did so, a lot of ill-mannered doctors would be more likely to treat their patients with the respect they DESERVE.Don't let anyone tell you this is all in your head.\u00a0\u00a0Even in cases where symptoms are due to depression, that is no less a physical, biochemical illness than diabetes or heart disease or any other illness.DEMAND the care and respect you have coming, in a calm and reasonable manner and you will eventually find a doctor or team of caregivers who will make the effort to diagnose and treat you as you deserve. It will take work and persistence on your part but it can be done.My very best wishes to you!Michelle, RN, BSN, Patient Advocate",

    "question": "I've been having problems for about 2 years now. I started having dizzy spells while looking down. Things like doing the dishes would trigger them. Has progressed to being dizzy all the time. Constant rocking motion that seems to be timed with my heartbeat. When constant rocking started fluid started coming from my ears also vasospasms started in my hands and feet. Vision is sometimes blurry. my ears ring and i have sudden but brief periods of hearing loss. I've been told I have nystagmus. knee refexes are quick also have lots of muscle twitches. finally, lots of skipped heart beats. Ive also lost 20 lbs. MRI of brain showed 3 areas of increased T2 signal strengh(periventrical region). No post contrast differences noted. These foci are so small that they didn't show up on previous open MRI. Iam extemly frusterated. Been told to just deal with it and/or its all in your head. I don't feel this is MS. I personally believe this to be some sort of circulatory disfunction. Possibly hormone related? Doctors are more inclined to laugh at me rather than help. Where can i go to find someone who cares enough to listen and will run the necessary tests to find out what is going on. Any insight would be greatly appriciated. Thank you and happy Easter.Brian",
