If you are asked to fast for 8 hours it's better you go for the test first thing in the morning. Otherwise since you sleep the whole day, you will be fasting for 8 hours and test can be done in the evening. Good luck!",

    "question": "Hi,I am a 33 years old female with family history of diabetes and hypertension (mother) and gestational diabetes and hypertension (sister). Till now I have no history of either diabetes or hypertension. I am 26 weeks pregnant and have to undergo glucose tolerance test (GTT). It is usually advised to take the test early morning as metabolism falls in afternoon due to diurnal rhythm. My problem is that I have an upside routine for the past 5 months,\u00a0\u00a0I sleep during day around 8-9 AM and wake up at 5-6 PM in the evening. Can I take my GTT in evening, I assume that my biological clock is now set according to my sleep cycle? OR will it effect the result of my GTT?ThanksRegardsRitu",
