Dude, you really need to stop reading the internet, you're driving yourself crazy, this has to be making your life miserable.Good luck on getting a different answer again. I'm guessing it will be something like this again;\"I have personally answered this question in significant detail numerous times before and find it to be an absolute abuse on this forum that the person continues to repost in the hopes of obtaining a different answer.It is sad to say but I think your problem stems from obesity and that the only cure for all of your symptoms is weight loss and a removal from this fixation with your medical problems. You need exercise in moderate amounts initially and caloric restriction. This relative hypoglycemia you feel is very likely to be stemming from high average blood sugars, and the fatigue from early onset of diabetes meelitus.I suggest you take up an aerobic sport which may be conducive to weight loss, establishment of strong interpersonal relationships, and a general sense of well being. Walking, cycling, swiming are all very good sports which will help you a great deal.\"",

    "question": "Hi,\u00a0\u00a0I'm a 33 yr old male.\u00a0\u00a0Almost 2 years ago I had a meningioma taken out of my head.\u00a0\u00a0 I had no complications and the surgery was successful,\u00a0\u00a0no signs of a returing tumor.I used to work out 4-5 days per week, weight lifting and intense cardio.\u00a0\u00a0 After the surgery I was of course forbidden from weight lifting,\u00a0\u00a0since the surgery I gained about 50 pounds,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About 10 months ago after 1 year of almost no physical activity I start having many palpitations,\u00a0\u00a0bardycardia, lightheadedness, etc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My neurosurgeon was the first to get wind of this, he sent me right to my GP who got me a nuke stress test was abnormal for LAD ischemia.\u00a0\u00a0 and an echo which was normal except for mild mitral and pulmonic regurgitation.\u00a0\u00a0 He called me and said he was sure it was a false positive due to my 50 lbs over weight but he said we need to be sure, gave me the choice of arteriogram or CTA,\u00a0\u00a0I chose 64 slice CTA and it was very normal.(When I get to feeling bad with the symptoms I described, I also get this nausea and sometimes vomit into my mouth, and is often revieved by eating).I talked to a friend of mine who is a resident and he thinks I have reduced sympathetic tone from inactivity and that is the sole cause,\u00a0\u00a0but I've been exercising again and it's not going away.Can you make any suggestions?",
