            "answer": "I'm so sorry about your kitty. After my cat had her ears cleaned she came home completely deaf and with vestibular syndrome. After that I researched and read a lot to learn about what might have happened and during my research I often came upon articles about cats becoming deaf or blind after dental work requiring anesthesia. It seems to be mainly irreversible, but who knows if that is it since there is also something going on with the legs. He may be lethargic due to vision changes, but it might be something more, too. What I highly recommend is taking him to a neurologist who specializes in these issues, and I would do it right away since treating these issues early on is always best. With my cat, the neurologist did an MRI and it was able to give us some answers. It is expensive, but after much back and forth, the vet that was responsible for the deafness covered the cost of the neurologist, so that is something to consider. I'd look for a vet neurologist in your area and get some tests done. It's terrible to watch the suffering and I remember how traumatized I was when my cat came home with somewhat similar issues. I can say this: even if he ends up remaining blind, it will get easier and he can still have a happy life with your support and love. I hope it ends up being temporary and treatable. Good luck.",

            "answer": "Hi David,SamanthaCat is the best person to get support from. She has been through Hell and back. I am so happy to hear she was reimbursed for the Neurological Specialist.This is also what you might look into if this problem continues. We do the things we think are best for our babies and can't help but be devastated when something goes terribly wrong at the hands of those we trust with our precious ones.\u00a0\u00a0There is nothing we can do and certainly cannot blame ourselves for wanting only the best for our babies.Like SamCat says ---hope this is reversible, but if not your love , support and nurturing is all your baby will need to continue to live a most wonderful life.I am sending prayers and hoping things turn around in the near future. Please keep us posted as SamCat did. We love all our MedHelp kitties and only want the best for them.Sincerely,CML",

    "question": "13-yr-old male Burmese cat diagnosed with diabetes about 6 weeks ago. We are managing with insulin shots. During the course of exams for diabedies we discovered two teeth needed to be extracted. Vet did that yesterday. We brought Oscar home yesterday afternoon. He was lethargic, wouldn't eat, or drink. Same this morning - wouldn't eat or drink and very lethargic. Took him to vet today where he spent most of the day. They gave him fluids, force fed him, gave him appetite stimulant & managed his glucose with insulin. Vet said after a couple hours he was up & vocalizing, and scratching his head on cage and walked a bit. Vet was encouraged. But during afternoon, he became lethargic again and can see light but seems blind in that he doesn't track a hand moving in front of his face. Also back legs are not working right. He his home now but not moving much. Dr. does not have answers other than thinks neorlogical problem as a result of anesthesia. Taking him to another dr. tomorrow 2nd opinion. Feeling helpless. Thoughts?",
