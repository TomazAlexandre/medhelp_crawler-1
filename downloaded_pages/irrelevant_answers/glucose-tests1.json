            "answer": "Depends on what you ate before you had the test. If you had something real sugary beforehand that might have affected it.They're going to run the 3 hour, fasting test just as precaution. At this point it's not a big deal. And if that one comes back high, they'll consider you to either have it be at risk of gestational diabetes. Which also, isn't that big of a deal. It's a serious thing, but not tragic. You'll be put on a special diet and as long as you follow it and take care of yourself and baby throughout the rest of the pregnancy it'll go away after delivery.Good luck.",
