            "answer": "Your good.... My neuro told me I have merliga parasthetica in my thighs. And I do have slight carpel tunnel in my wrists. But he believes tight jeans & low d caused the mp. In addition my arm pain is from low d. I have always had neck problems. He never even asked me about my neck. I was tested for diabetes and my b 12 is fine. I can't find any info anywhere that states vit d can cause all my symptoms. That factor is stressing me out!!",

            "answer": "Thanks.I suffer from meralgia parasthetica and this gets worse with standing and walking.\u00a0\u00a0I was never told that it was caused by wearing tight jeans (I don't wear trousers) nor anything about low levels of Vitamin D.\u00a0\u00a0What I was told though was to lose weight to ease the meralgia parathetica.\u00a0\u00a0I did take vitamin supplements containing Vitamin D and D3 for quite a while and found no benefit at all.\u00a0\u00a0I did lose some weight and it did help, but the weight is back up again, and the legs are worse.I was told that I have peripheral nerve damage by a neurologist some years ago (before I had the mp) and was told to control my diabetes (I was not and am not a diabetic) but I am glucose intolerant.Doctors in the UK don't normally take blood tests for vitamin D levels, so I have never had a blood test for that.I do know that Vitamin D is required to help the absorption of calcium and a lack of it can cause rickets (bone deformity).\u00a0\u00a0Having too much Vitamin D can also be damaging to health.\u00a0\u00a0The fat vitamins A, D, K are stored in the liver.\u00a0\u00a0Exposing your skin to the sunlight for a few minutes each day, allows your body to make vitamin D from absorbing the sunshine.\u00a0\u00a0It is also referred sometimes as the Sunshine Vitamin.\u00a0\u00a0These vitamins, I read, are also not destroyed by cooking.Water soluble vitamins, like B12 and C, need to be consumed every day.\u00a0\u00a0These do not get stored in the body and an excess amount in the body is excreted through urine.I would be interested to know if the Vitamin D helps to relieve your nerve pains and whether you are overweight.\u00a0\u00a0As I have been told to lose weight to relieve the discomfort of mp, it would be interesting to know whether you are overweight or not and whether thin people do get this problem.Other people with more knowledge of Vitamin D hopefully will join this forum to give you (and me) more input about this Vitamin.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "Nope I'm not overweight, so thin people can get it to. Doc said jeans can squeeze the femoral nerve and cause it to become entrapped. He also said if your overweight, become pregnant, or wear a tool belt. I will keep u updated on whether or not the d supplements help me. When I first got my d level checked it was 11 , normal range is 30-100. My pain started right before my doctor checked my vit d. I had my d checked two months ago and its at 34. So its slowly getting higher. The pain has gotten less severe. But it still hurts like a u know what if I wear jeans. It feels like a million bees are stinging my thighs. Even if the sheets touch my skin I want to scream. Mp is a mysterious",

            "answer": "I found that touch the outer thigh above the knee was very painful.\u00a0\u00a0But now it is numb all the time.\u00a0\u00a0But the sensation of pins and needles start in the lower belly and groin and run down the outside of both thighs the more I stand and walk.\u00a0\u00a0I am overweight.I find that arching my back, like trying to touch the toes, helps to relieve the pressure a little, but only lying down relieves the worst discomfort.Best not to wear the tight jeans - it's not worth the pain and discomfort.Fascinating to know that thin people can get the problem too.\u00a0\u00a0I never experienced it when I was thin - but I never wore tight clothing.\u00a0\u00a0Baggy trousers were the fashion when I was young.I look forward to hearing how you get on when your Vitamin levels get higher.\u00a0\u00a0If there is an improvement in your condition, I might pester my doctor to check my D levels.\u00a0\u00a0I had a blood test taken yesterday to check my glucose levels.\u00a0\u00a0I am glucose intolerant and my last blood test was taken 2 years ago.",

            "answer": "I feel the mp on the front and sides of my thighs & sometimes on my hips. I wanted to share some news with you. On the neurology forum I asked if low vit d could cause my symptoms and a doctor replied to my comment. She said low d can cause symptoms that mimic neuropathy. So maybe you should get you d checked. After all it wouldn't hurt. What is glucose intolerant? How were u diagnosed? I'm asking because my A1c CAME back normal, but sometimes my sugar levels are to low. But I don't think that would cause my problems. Another thing I looked up tight jeans and mp, & sure enough there have been reported cases ever since skinny jeans hit the fashion world. I never wear skinny jeans but I do wear hip huggers. Now I by them two sizes bigger. I hope we can overcome our mp. It's hard to exercise with mp. Well at least for me it is. I started taking 50,000 units once a week of vit d three months ago. Now I take 1600 mgs daily. Had my level check two months ago and they went from 11 to 34. I need to get it checked again in a month or so.",

            "answer": "Thanks for passing on the info.I was diagnosed with mp about 6 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I was referred to the physiotherapist and they hadn't a clue what my problem was, so they rang up the Triage service which is a level higher than the physiotherapist and thats what they said that I had.I will mention the Vitamin D to my doctor and see if he agrees to let me have a blood test for that.\u00a0\u00a0The nurse took my blood test on Monday for the HbA1C which gives the average blood sugar levels over a 3 month period.I was tested 2 years ago and my levels indicated glucose intolerance.Nurse couldn't get any blood out of my right arm and I have a bad bruise that had a white lump in the middle - it is quite painful.\u00a0\u00a0On the left arm there is hardly any mark at all.When I had my test some years ago to see if I had diabetes (because I was complaining of pins and needles everywhere), I was sent to the hospital on an empty stomach.\u00a0\u00a0The nurse took a blood test and shortly afterwards we (there were 2 of us in the same room at the time) were given a small container of glucose to drink.\u00a0\u00a0After I drank it, I kept drinking like a fish and couldn't quench my thirst.\u00a0\u00a0The other person was fine and didn't even drink a drop.\u00a0\u00a0Nurse came and took another blood test shortly after that glucose drink.\u00a0\u00a0I knew that mine would be near the diabetic mark and I was told that I have a glucose intolerance.\u00a0\u00a0This means that I am not at the level that is set to be a diabetic, but I am not far off.\u00a0\u00a0I do suffer frequently from Thrush which is a common problem with people with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I know when my sugar levels are low because I start to feel extreme hunger and I feel like vomiting and get a headache, sometimes I get body shakes.You don't have to be a diagnosed as a diabetic to suffer from hypoglycaemia (low sugar levels).\u00a0\u00a0Make sure that you eat slow release foods and have something with you when you go out like a piece of fruit or anything so that your sugar levels do not slump too low.\u00a0\u00a0Sugary foods will give you a sugar rush and then your levels will quickly slump down again.Low levels of B1 and B12 can also cause feelings of neuropathy too.\u00a0\u00a0Many years ago my doctor prescribed me with the Vitamin B complex as I was complaining of pins and needles a lot in my feet.\u00a0\u00a0It turned out that I had a kidney stone and I think that caused pressure on nerves giving me the symptoms of pins and needles in the feet.\u00a0\u00a0When the stone was removed, my symptoms subsided.\u00a0\u00a0I do get pins and needles in my feet from time to time now but I know that that is referred problems in my back.That's great that your Vitamin D levels have improved.Keep me posted.Best wishes.",
