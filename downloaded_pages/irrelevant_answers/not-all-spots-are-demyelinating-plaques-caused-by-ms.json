    "question": "Many people come to our forum because they are told they have \"white spots, or lesions on their brain, and the doctor will not dx them with MS, thought they feel they have met the Criteria by their own research or what they have learned here.We\u2019ve discussed at length why MS is so difficult to dx, the mimics, and how not all lesions are created equal, or by the same disease process.We state that there are other causes of brain lesions, or white spots, discuss the differential diagnoses and provide resources. I hope this list further helps to bring about awareness of why the doctor may not dx you with MS. And, this info is in our health pages too - so for newcomers who have not had the opportunity, please browse through them.Injuries can cause brain lesion, immune disorders, diseases, viruses and I\u2019ve even read that some exposure to certain chemicals can cause brain spots, or changes. Sometimes the doctor simply cannot identify the cause.Here are just a few (and, I'd like to add to this - so those w/differential dx w/lesions or spots - please list your dx) We'll compare this list to the health page, and add if it's missing:ADEMVasculitisChronic HypertensionEnlarged Perivascular SpacesLymphomaNon-specific UBOsCADASIL-Shell",
