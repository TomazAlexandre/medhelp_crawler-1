            "answer": "I am really sorry that you are going through this. Do you know if the fetus was developed when you hd ectopic?I think you should ask your doctor to run some genetic tests. It looks like that in all your pregnancies the fetus never developed. In that case bed rest would not have helped. I hope you have a healthy pregnancy soon. Never give up hope.",

            "answer": "Hey!!!!, I know how hard and frustrating it is for you right now especially not having any answers to whats going on. I'm 21 years old and I too have had 1 missed abortion and 2 misscarriages (first started at 17 years old) being so young you would think I wouldnt have any problems. But yeah I ended up going to a gyno and he issued me to take 2 tablets of progesterone vaginally a day (200mg) once I fell pregnant, right up until 14 weeks and I am still pregnant (4th pregnancy) going on 17 weeks. Its just a matter of time but you will find the answers your looking for, just hang in there.",
