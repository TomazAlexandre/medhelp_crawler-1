    "question": "hi,I am a lesbian in my mid 20's. I have been in a mongamous relationship with a girl for 3 years. about 4 months ago, she cheated on me with a man. She has had two HIV tests at my request. 1 month blood test and at three months, oral swab test. Both negative. We have had sexual contact since the tests. oral sex, and grinding. she has type 1 diabetes. Could this affect the tests accuracy? Am i at risk? I am worrying far too much. Tonight her face broke out into a sudden rash. she tested her blood sugar and it was 600. could this cause the rash? i 'm worried.",
