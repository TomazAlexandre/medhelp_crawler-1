            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Can you elaborate on the absence of the pupil in one eye? What other symptoms were present? The iris is the colored part of the eye that controls the amount of light that goes into the eye. Without the iris, bright light can be very uncomfortable. The absence of this part is called aniridia which is usually congenital in nature.\u00a0\u00a0Other conditions such as glaucoma, foveal hypoplasia, corneal degeneration, cataracts, diabetes or glucose intolerance, Wilms' tumor, genital abnormalities and mental retardation can also be associated with aniridia. If it persists or recurs, it is best that you have this checked by your eye doctor for proper evaluation. Take care and do keep us posted.",
