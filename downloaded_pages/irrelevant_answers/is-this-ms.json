            "answer": "Dear Stephie:Sorry your having such nerve wretching symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think they sound like MS.\u00a0\u00a0To have sensory changes all over your body, your MRI of the brain should have been very abnormal.\u00a0\u00a0Your symptoms do not have the waxing and waning with periods of complete restoration of symptoms that MS usually has.\u00a0\u00a0Since you have had some of these symptoms since childhood, this also is against the diangosis of MS.\u00a0\u00a0I would not think that you have MS.\u00a0\u00a0Whether an accident could cause such widespread symptoms that continue, is questionable.\u00a0\u00a0Alot would depend on the type of accident, degree of disability, and the neurological exam.\u00a0\u00a0With a completely normal neurological exam, the accident of 2 years duration without recovery would be unlikely unless the symptoms were so bad that initially you were hospitalized with significant symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0With thewidespread and non-focal symptoms you describe, I think it would be unlikely.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",
