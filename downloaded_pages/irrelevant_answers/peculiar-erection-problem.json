            "answer": "Hello,Since you are having nocturnal erections, so it is less likely a medical problem. What you are having is erectile dysfunction due to psychological reasons. Common causes causing erection problem are stress and anxiety,poor communication with your partner, unrealistic sexual expectations, which make sex a task rather than a pleasure,negative feelings about non performance,smoking, alcohol and sometimes illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression and neurological causes.Talk to your partner openly about any fears or apprehensions,eat nutritious healthy food,exercise regularly and cut down on smoking or alcohol if you are taking it.If still a problem then please get yourself evaluated for the medical conditions mentioned above. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Hello Mr.Kaur,Thank you very much for the reply.Even though my father is a diabetic, at 29 I am hoping diabetes is not the cause.But, I ll still get tested to check my testosterone and diabetes.Also, somehow I have always felt that my nocturnal erections have always been better than erections even during masturbation. Could there be any reason for that?And recently I have been observing I have been getting nocturnal erections only when I am with my girl friend. Is that a sign to worry again?",
