            "answer": "There are no doctors on this forum. Your post doesn't appear to be related to t2 diabetes either. Your post also doesn't give a clue as to what tests have been performed, the results, what diseases that have been ruled out, medications, what type of doctors she has seen, and so forth. I suggest you try posting on the Ask A Doctor Forums - Autoimmune Disorders, Gastroenterology, Internal Medicine, and Undiagnosed Symptoms and go from there. Provide exact medical details & history. Good luck",

I went through the exact same problems until I was diagnosed with this common side effect of diabeties. I hope you both will figure out the problem and she will feel better soon. If this is what it is; there are medications that help. Just a thought... Good luck!",

    "question": "my wife has been in and out of the doctors and Hospital so many times i have lost count, every single time she eat's or drink's she goes straight to the bath room to vomit she cant keep any thing down even if its healthy food including salids - she does have pancreatitis which she has now been told has cleared up but not to eat wheat, had her gallbladder removed, got a hiatus hernia and got a ulcer in her hiatus hernia and my wife is also on a type 2 diabetic diet - I really want to get the the bottom of this as she is constantly sick in the bath room which i have witnessed and told the doctors of my worry about my wife keep being sick and the doctors send her to Hospital - but it looks like the Hospital don't seem to have a clue what it is or what they are doing all the hospital does is keep sending her home even when she is still unwell and still is constantly sick - I got no time any more for this Hospital which I wont say what Hospital it is - but my wife and I are going to try to goto a different Hospital and abandon them completely they are a waste of time and energy - let some one else try who might know what they are talking about and know what it might be.",
