            "answer": "Please read the info on the following website:http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/pancreatitis/From what I have read, a person who has suffered from alcohol-related pancreatitis should stop drinking alcohol altogether. Apparently, the first time it happens, it can be resolved fairly quickly, but it can get more and more serious with repeated episodes. It can be life-threatening. Can destroy the kidneys. None of the dangers are worth risking by drinking. All the info I found says that people who have suffered an attack of this sort should stop drinking completely.",

He is still drinking, though, and I'm just trying to figure out if there is any amount he can drink and be safe- or if he does need to stop altogether- as I'm not sure that can happen at this point. He does not have health insurance at this point so I can't take him to the doctor to have them talk to them. I guess maybe I could find a free clinic?Thanks again for the advice!",
