            "answer": "Hi,Many epidemiological studies have established cigarette smoking as an important risk factor for stroke.Until recently, however, this relation was based on observational studies and the effects of smoking were thought to be synergistic with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, glucose intolerance, age, hypercholesterolaemia, and pre-existing cardiovascular disease.Now we have definite evidence that smoking itself has a direct causal effect on stroke.Cigarette smoking is thus a definite independent risk factor for stroke, particularly ischaemic stroke. The mechanisms are poorly understood but may be associated with raised fibrinogen levels, increased packed cell volume, decreased macrophage activity, or changes in lipid biochemistry promoting atherosclerosis. The evidence for a causal association between cigarette smoking and extracranial carotid atherosclerosis is abundant. All smokers who stop smoking will benefit from reducing their risk of ischaemic stroke, irrespective of the degree of previous exposure to smoking.ref: http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/317/7164/962Once ischaemic stroke occurs the most common presentation is hemiplegia and muscle weakness of the face (usually on one side of the body),numbness .After a stroke, control signals from the brain often cannot reach some muscles, typically in the hand or foot. Without these signals, the level of electrical activity in these muscles is too low for them to contract adequately on their own. This causes them to become increasingly weaker.Stroke rehabilitation, or, in more optimistic terms, stroke recovery, is the process by which patients with disabling strokes undergo treatment to help them return to normal life as much as possible by regaining and relearning the skills of everyday living.Stroke rehabilitation can last from a few days up to several months.ref:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_rehabilitationHopr this helps you.",

            "answer": "Here in the UK you're classed as a younger stroke survivor if you're aged under 65; at least that's what seems to be the case here in Portsmouth, where I live. To see the local stroke specialist dr in the stroke clinic you have to be aged 65 or over, so being aged 52 and wanting a second medical opinion on something stroke-related, i had to pay out for a private medical second opinion.As to smoking being a factor, it certainly wasn't in my case. I was just turned 51 when i had my stroke, and I've never smoked in my life. I agree in that smoking can be a factor behind a lot of people who have strokes, but what about those of us who've never touched the filthy weed?",
