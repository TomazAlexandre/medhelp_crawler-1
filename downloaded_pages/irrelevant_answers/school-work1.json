            "answer": "Hello.A typical nerve cell has a cell body, its small and short projections (dendrites) and one single long tail like projection (axon). This entire cell is microscopic. If you could some how enlarge the whole picture where the cell body is the size of a tennis ball, the axon would run just over a kilometer long! That's a typical neuronal cell.Any injury to the axonal part is called Axonal Neuropathy. This is not a disease by itself. It is a manifestation. There are many causes for axonal neuropathy. Diabetes, alcoholism, vitamin deficiencies, hereditary neuropathies, etc are some of them. Treating the root cause helps treat the neuropathy.Regards",
