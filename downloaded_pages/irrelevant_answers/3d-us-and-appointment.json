            "answer": "same here with the test! Yuck! Mine is tomorrow. No they already moved my dates up and there is no way he would be further as I mc the month before and had 2 us afterwards to check on things. PLus I had 4 with in weeks 4-6 and they saw the development. It was at week 7-8 they moved my dates from the 1st from the 4th. He is just big but once they stop the shots I could go fast so maybe my body is helping him be big for an early entrance:)",

    "question": "Well he was 2lbs 6oz and they are going to start growth checks as he measures that he si due a month earlier. Which that would be 5 weeks early by my dates and when I could of gotten pregnant. The high risk dr said he is great though and his breathing shows he is furher along also. ALso that he had a full bladder and showed his kidneys working as he was older. They could see that once they put the blue and red colors on the screen. Neat! I did not even know that they were going to do a #D till I saw it on the TV! I cried and was happy and sad that DH was not there! Fluid levels and placenta looked great too. No doubt he is a boy but htey never gave another picture for that. Just amazing! I still have only gained 7lbs and the dr said I have no signs of gestational diabetes but I will get that test soon. My finger ***** after eating though came back great and he said he thinks I do not have it.",
