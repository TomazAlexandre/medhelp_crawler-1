            "answer": "You might be. If your blood glucose was 61 an hour or two after breakfast, especially if your breakfast was fairly high carb (such as cereal, bread, etc) you might have a specific type of hypoglycemia called reactive hypoglycemia which is people who have low blood sugar after a meal high in carbs. I would suggest seeing your doctor and getting tested to see what type of hypoglycemia you have and to make sure you aren't pre-diabetes. Many people experience hypoglycemic symptoms for years before getting diagnosed with diabetes.",

            "answer": "I felt the same way right before i go diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.U may want to talk to doctor about this and waking up with low blood sugars is normal. Eating every 2 to 4 hours could be a case of you not eating enough at your meals.Orange juice is a good way to get your sugar up if your not hungry its going into your blood stream fast but watch how much you drink drink too much then you may have a high sugar for some time.Carbs do get your sugar up but they also make you gain wight. Try drinking powerade.",

    "question": "I have always suspected that I had hypoglycemia (by which I mean the chronic kind, whatever that may be called).\u00a0\u00a0I have all the classic symptoms, as my mother says.\u00a0\u00a0I need to eat every 2-4 hours, otherwise I become very lethargic, even rude.\u00a0\u00a0That's on the outside - inside I feel hungry, nauseous, have a headache, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I once passed out in high school because I hadn't eaten enough one day.\u00a0\u00a0I recently had a \"physical\" for a life insurance policy.\u00a0\u00a0They took my blood around 10:30 a.m. on a Saturday.\u00a0\u00a0I had eaten breakfast only about an hour before, maybe up to two hours.\u00a0\u00a0My blood glucose was 61.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I have two questions.\u00a0\u00a0The first is whether I should get tested for anything like adrenal deficiencies or something else?\u00a0\u00a0The second pertains to diet.\u00a0\u00a0The advice I've gotten from those close to me is to eat protein, try to limit carbs, definitely keep sugar intake as low as possible.\u00a0\u00a0I agree with the sugar, but I have found that eating protein does nothing to curb my symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I've tried nuts as snacks and various bean salads, vegetables...but I almost feel like they make it worse.\u00a0\u00a0Only when I eat something heavy in carbs do I feel better.\u00a0\u00a0Whole wheat toast, peanut butter with crackers, rice, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Am I making the hypoglycemia worse by eating carbohydrates?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for any advice.",
