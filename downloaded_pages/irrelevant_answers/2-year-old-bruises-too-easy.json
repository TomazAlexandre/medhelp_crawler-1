    "question": "Hello everyone. My 2 year old son i have noticed here lately seems to have bruises all over him. None on his butt, or head, but everywhere else. Mainly on his legs front and back and arms front and back. he does fall alot. My daughter never bruised that easy. He has dirty blonde hair and blue eyes, but my daughter is the saem. His iron lvls are fine. My husband and I have noticed a few weird things about him other than that. He always wants to eat, he eats and 15 mins later hungry again. He wants \"drinks\" all the time. No excessive urination though. He seems to have a slight tremor too. Maybe but not really sure on that. Any suggestions? I asked the ped. doc all he had to say was light hair, blue eyes , bruise easy. He didn't even look him over. So what next, any one got one like this or had one like this.",
