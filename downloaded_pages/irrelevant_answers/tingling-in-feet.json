            "answer": "Dear Paul,I understand your predicament. I suggest you give your body some time and try to relax yourself since anxiety blurs one\u2019s logical thinking. Many patients have possible disc related problems and devise a management plan with their neurologist. The good news is that you are active and these symptoms have not stopped you. Slipped and bulging disc can be a cause for concern with their consequent health issues. You have been having back pain issues for about 25 years and weight loss has been relatively recent so the already affected discs would be causing these symptoms. I suggest that you consult a neurologist for a detailed neurological examination and an MRI spine to locate the affected discs and rule out cervical disc involvement. The danger signs are chronic back pain associated with numbness or weakness, loss of bowel and bladder control, suggesting cauda equine syndrome due to extreme nerve compression of lower spinal nerves necessitating urgent surgical intervention. I understand that you don\u2019t have any of these.Depending on the MRI reports and clinical correlation, you would be advised back stretching or strengthening exercises.\u00a0\u00a0Physical therapy, exercise and massage would be helpful. In case you are having back pain and spasms also, over the counter NSAIDs and prescribed medicines to relieve spasms may be used.There is a role of epidural injected steroids for nerve compression and inflammation if physical therapy including therapeutic exercise, manual therapy and medications don\u2019t relieve symptoms adequately.Surgical decompression is considered when all these medical measures don\u2019t help.I would also suggest that you rule out diabetes, get a blood test for vitamin B12 levels and check thyroid hormone levels.You can take the advice of a physician for anxiety and panic attacks and medications if indicated.You are most welcome to clarify your doubts with me on this forum.Best wishes",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for your input! You have been very kind and generous with your thoughts. I believe in time my doctor will explore the other options you cite, but he is a very patient, methodical man, -- And I am of course, with tingling feet, nervous and impatient. I will stay active and try to look at long term recovery, instead of always looking for a \"quick fix\". Sugar is not an issue - my yearly Phys shows A1c results 4.8, 5.0, and most recently 4.9\u00a0\u00a0So my plan now is to stay active and focused, and listen to my Doctor. Once again, Bless you for your kindness.",

    "question": "Hello all,Been worried about a problem I have with both of my feet tingling - left foot on the right side, and right foot on the right side. Pins and needles. I have had back problems for 25 years, with slipped and bulging disks. Also, another problem wich has taken a toll, is that I was seriously overweight (weighed 410 pounds and 6 foot 6 inches) for 20 years. I lost 200 pounds 10 years ago and have kept the weight off. The weight was gone, but the bad back stayed.So now I have the tingling in my feet. I have been to the doctors, they believe it is my disks causing the pressure on the nerves causing the tingling. They want to begin me on PT, and give it time. One of the doctors has told me that it will probably be something I will have to live with, in varying intesities, for quite a while ( like arthritis). It has not stopped me from doing anything and I still enjoy being active. But I guess I am wondering if this is something others have lived with for a long period of time, and if so, what is a good way of dealing with it? I have found that the worry and anxiety caused by this is much worse than the actual feeling of tingling in my feet. I guess i should also mention I have severe anxiety/panic attack problems, which makes none of this easier to deal with.The doctors all tell me to do PT, stay active, and give it all the time it needs. Does that sound right to anybody??Thanks for listening (reading). Just knowing someone else knows what I am going through is a comfort.Bless you,paul",
