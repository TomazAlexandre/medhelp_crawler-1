            "answer": "\"I had a blood test done and it shows my glucose level to be low at 68 (range 80-110).\"Are we to assume this result was after 8-10 hours of fasting? And by the way, normal fasting blood glucose ranges are 70-99 mg/dl. A level of 110 mg/dl is considered prediabetes.\"Is it normal for your glucose levels to be low at certain times during the day,1.e., if you haven't eaten for a couple of hours, etc?\"That's a little difficult to answer for it depends a lot on what you ate before. If it was full meal then no, it is not normal to have low glucose levels \"a couple of hours\" later. After meals, blood glucose peaks in your body 2-3 hours later.\"I just don't know what is considered a red flag when tested.\"A fasting level of 68 mg/dl is a red flag. Family history of diabetes is a red flag. Previous case of gestational diabetes is a red flag. All that coupled with autoimmune diseases makes your red flag high on the pole.You should be thoroughly examined by an Endocrinologist, a doctor who specializes in the endocrine system where diabetes wreaks havoc. This is the specialist someone with your issues must see.",

            "answer": "The test was just part of the CBC blood test.\u00a0\u00a0I had eaten lunch about 3 hours before the test was done I think.\u00a0\u00a0However, I cannot recall what I had for lunch that day either.It was my Endocrine who ordered the tests along with my thyroid testing, so we'll see.\u00a0\u00a0I don't see him until January, so I was just curious about the bloodwork since they flagged it as being low.Thanks for the explanations!",

            "answer": "Normally glucose testing are separate from a CBC [Complete Blood Test]. Also required to fast 8-10 hours prior. Eating 3 hours prior will skewer you results.Considering your autoimmune issues, you should read up on diabetes type 1.5, aka LADA [Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults]. People with this type tend to rise in the morning with higher than normal blood glucose levels, and after eating may have a drop in blood glucose levels. I call it a reverse spin cycle [no pun intended]. A lot of doctors have not been made aware or just do not know how to treat LADA. Frequent testing before meals and after meals to see how foods affect your blood glucose is a must. Bad carbs and starches are bad guys so pay strict attention to the intake. Do you have a home glucose meter? Get one if you don't. Several can be had OTC. Post back if you need to know test times.A frequent poster, Zoelula, is a LADA, and has worked hard to figure out the disease and how to manage it. Hopefully she'll stop by and post suggestions. In the meantime,\u00a0\u00a0read up on LADA so you are able to discuss it with your Endo.Xplained: http://www.diabetesmonitor.com/lada.htmForum: http://tinyurl.com/LadaforLori",

            "answer": "Hi WaveRider,I thought I'd let you know that I got a letter in the mail yesterday from Aetna (med. insurance carrier) telling me they started a new program where they now analyze any bloodwork /x-rays /tests that come through.\u00a0\u00a0They advised me to call my doctor because of a possible case of diabetes and high cholesterol (I do not know how they got that from a CBC and thyroid testing).\u00a0\u00a0Needless to say, I'm calling my Endo today.I have been researching diabetes the past couple days and I guess I have had a few symptoms that I either never really paid much attention to, or assumed they were thyroid related, so now I'm really curious.Thanks again for all your help!\u00a0\u00a0It's very much appreciated.Lori",
