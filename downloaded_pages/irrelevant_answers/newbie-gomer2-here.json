My first neuro told me (before he even looked at my diagnosis) that I was too old to have it. Not according to the MS Society!

            "answer": "What! ME a leather-neck jar-head........naw a swabie, blue-water sailor NAVY, remember the USMC is part of the NAVY..........aka the Navy's army. I was an airdale, not a black-shoe, worked in recon and avionics.Please, sometimes my typing is a bit off, not to mention I am the greatest speller that ever existed (being sarcastic). I often hit the keys out or order etc. I try and correct as I go, but sometimes I jsut let them stay (lazy and get tired of corrrecting so many)GOMER is mil-speak for GET OUT!, My Exam Room! I first became a GOMER in boot camp. I got an upper resporatory infection, seen and twice admitted to the infirmary, released too soon, felt like **** then one time my CO (like drill sgt.) ordered me back to sick bay and the other time I was carried back. I don't get over things as fast as most people. Then while in A-school I got kicked out (GOMERed) over and over by sick bay for about 10 days.Laying on the beach (stationed in Jacksonville fla) I felt so miserable I was determined I was going back to sick-bay even if it ment the doc kicking me out again. He saw me waiting outside his door waiting for sick call. He came out, grabbed me by the shirt and marched me down to Xray, saying \"i'm gonna PROVE there is nothing worng with you\" He stood there while they did the Xray, then we went back to his sick-bay office wehre he arranged an meat-wagon to take me to the hospital.When I got to teh hospital I was charged with criminal violatin of UCMJ, \"failre to seek medical treatment\". I signed the paperwork adn requested my A-School sick bay records for the previous 10 days for my defense. I never ehard another word about it after that and never ahd to go to Captain's mast.The last time I was admitted overnight in the navy, abdominal pain, I had to take a urine sugar test, I must have passed?? because I returned to duty. The test & result are missing form my medical\u00a0\u00a0records, along with many other tid-bits. The new I suffered a hearing loss while in and kept it from me for 40 years! My release from active duty phsyical is nothing more than a copy of my boot camp one, they simply crossed out \"recruit\" and wrote \"AE2\", it even reads GreatLakes NTC at the top and bottom......lolBack 2 the future; When I was 14 I was told at the hospital I would end up on shots, I told them I did not want to even hear about such, and I did get better. I got a letter from a doc there so I could get considered for the Navy. I fought to get in, while others were fleeing to Canada etc. I gave my fam doc a copy of that letter from my Navy med records I got earlier this eyar.When I had hepatitis, I was taken directly to the hospitla and in for 5 weeks. Everyone else in the family was back to school/work in 2 weeks. I missed almost 2 full months of 9th grade. I began having vision problems (double vision) in 10th grade, but did not get glasses til the year I graduated from HS.I worked full time durring my senior year and when I backed a truck into a pole in front of my boss.well it was time for glasses. Driving 2 vehicles down 2 streets forward was a lot easier than backing up.......lolWhile in 10th or 11th grade one leg locked up, a doc said it was probably bursistis and it cleared on its own anyway. I have ahd problems with leg weakness off and on over the eyars, I think its usually the same leg. 2 years ago, after not doctoring for a few, jsut got my insulin OTC and flying on my own, I was trying to get myself out of a mild DKA, but had to return to doctoring. I crossed his threshold bare able to walk, torn rotor cuff and 4 cataracts and balance had gotten even worse, kinda overlaoded him. Took 2 surgeries in 07 to fix the shoulder, healing problems with the first one due to the diabetes, and got my cataracts fixed, learned to walk better in P/T, felt funny having to wear a gait belt and take walking lessons at 60 something!I FIRED that podiatrist that was hung up on possable MS, but in researching WHY I got double vision etc I keep finding possable MS. That hoof doc was also fixated about my cancer history as well, a lymph node sarcoma in '82 (same leg again) . Another thing that picked my interest/Qs about MS was reading about prevelance of a person ahving BOTH diabetes AND MS.(*&*( GOMER",

            "answer": "I DID see a neurologist in late 07(?) the first hoof doc sent me to one, concerned about my left leg being so weak, he was the one concered about possable MS. Before that MS had never ever been mentined, even in passing. To my knowledge I have never been tested for antibodies, not even relating to the diabetes. I now have much better control of my diabetes, 5 shots a day though. My FamDoc double checked my left leg 3 mo ago, its good now, I have regained about all my strength in it, took 2 years though. It did get to the point I was crawling up and down the stairs.......lolMy vestibular - balance is not the greatest, never bothered my walking till a few years ago. I gave up bowling nearly 30 years ago. I used to sometimes fall after releasing the ball, never got hurt though, just crawled back to the foul line to trip the detector. Others in the alley would be stunned and concered I was injured, never was though. I bowled clean up position.While diabetes is in every generation in my family, never heard of any MS though.Chas....that mind-v- fingers..boy that IS familiar. I do a lot of correcting leter sequences. I have a copy of the MRI report, somewhere, maybe I need to find it and re-read it, maybe reading with an open mind to the MS possability, WHO KNOWS?Is thre a specific forum here for diabetics with MS? Just\u00a0\u00a0wondering, thinking it might help give me more specific insight. No I will not abandon this forum, its wehre I started.(*&*( GOMER2, an afterthought, should be GOMER3 as I am 3 people, me myself & I..",

            "answer": "Dtas OK........ya think I am pur fect?............lolI ahve long felt like an absent minded prof, but not a professor of any flavor.After my disappointing eye doc last week, I did more research adn since MS keeps cropping up, decided to educate myself a bit.........who knows?The only eye issues are distance/reading correction &\u00a0\u00a0I ahve is vertical adn horizontal double vision, corrected w/4 prism bases..I ahve no facial or headache issues.THe thing that started the MS question was severe leg weakness, I ahve recovered tough. I first ahd a problem when I was in 10th or 11th grade. As best I recall I could walk ok, w/limp as I could not bend my knnee, but there was no pain. I do not ahve any serious or frequent\u00a0\u00a0muscle spasums. I do ahve co-ordination problems, mind to fingers like when typing (nothing new, jsut a little worse) .I ahve ahd bouts fo leg weakness, fairly short lived and recover on its own over teh decades. When I was sent to the ENT, who ordered teh mri, I asked him but got NO direct answer, jsut there was nothing to be done to fix it (whatever it is) and told NOTHING with 2 wheels. My eye tracking is messes up on special testing, At least he did not jsut BLAME it on my diabetes like most do w/o question.I am thinking my famdoc may also suspect MS, but not talking. Here is why I raise this possablility; I asked another doc for a 24hr urine test, and said NO! The very next time I saw my famdoc he ordered it, and I did not raise the issue at all with him (I gave up wth teh \"NO\" from the otehr doc). After the 24hr he sent me to a nephrologist. This type of thing has happened other times about toher possable issues, therefore maybe my fam doc used the hoof doc to send me to the neuro. DANG that hurt, not very tollerent of the pain from teh needles (from about waist to feet)Anyway right now I ahve more questins than anything, but I really don't know enough yet to ask THE rpoper questions. I corrected some of my typing but also left some errors here, I seem to make more mistakees wehn it involves left versus right hand involving letter sequence. I Do see where there is a lot of overlap between nerve damage from MS v Diabetes.My diabetes is wierd, its better at times and worse other times over teh decades, NOT typical of either type-1 or type-2 diabetes, but I managed from early on more like a type-1. The ENT did report my vistibular problem cound be due to a possable CNS lesion. I was sent to vestibular therapy, gait therapy etc. My son went with me, he and the PT therapist was laughing at my eye movements, he siad it was like a \"cartoon\", my eyes over shoot or something like that in side to side follow the finger movements.(*&*( GOMER, its getting early again......",

    "question": "Well I was jsut doing some eResearch, came across this site and decided to give it a whirl........Why the MS board? Why Not?2 years ago I was sent to an ent and other specialists. He did an MRI some white spots (forget the termology etc), I also saw a foot doc who was (to me) obsessed I might have MS because one leg was quite weak. The neuro sad NO. I am fine either way, not gonna change much. I have alsresearch a lot recently on diabetes, yep I am diabetic type-2 insulin required. But unlike typical T2 diabetics mine gets worse at times and better for spells as well.I keep coming across MS for things I research, like inflamation (elivated sed rate lab) ordered by my nephrologist, yep K-bean CKD stage-3. I also have double vision, and wear prisms in my glasses, since 1964MY diabetes is rather odd.\u00a0\u00a0not quite a typical T1 or T2, even seem to alternate modes of no insulin like a T-1 or just short on natural insuln, more like a T-2 (what I am labeled as),. If I do not take enough insulin, even if my BS numbers are OK, I loose muscle strength, and have had a few bouts of MILD DKA.Anywho, I am a goofy ole fuddy duddy, a GOME(2) since Navy boot camp, married, 4 kids, 2 grands. I know I need to elaborate more on the history issue. but its getting late..or early whatever.Back 2morrow........(*&( GOMER",
