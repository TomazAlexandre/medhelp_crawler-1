            "answer": "Hey, thanks for getting back to me, with or without an answer. This \"\"blush\" thing showed up on a scan, seems to indicate that there're more veins in a particular area of the liver, though no lesions, densities etc. The doc sort of downplayed it, saying \"we see this all the time, we don't freak out too much about it anymore, since it appears to be commonplace.\"\u00a0\u00a0But, like elevated alpha fetoprotein, it calls for ongoing monitoring. Everything I've read on the net seems to associate this hypervascularity with the presence, or possible presence, of HCC. So naturally I'm freaking out all over the place, like I do whenever I read anything about medical conditions. Like Lewis Black, who claimed to contract diabetes by reading about it\u00a0\u00a0:)",

    "question": "Is this predictive of HCC? Or is it like elevated AFP,associated with HCC but not a \"smoking gun\", so to speak?",
