            "answer": "Yes.\u00a0\u00a0You can also find what is thought to be the active ingredient, coumarin, but it's also a blood thinner, so one has to be careful with it. This isn't from personal experience, but from customers who used it when I managed health food stores.\u00a0\u00a0You have to take a fair amount, however, for it to have a significant effect.\u00a0\u00a0There are also other substances that help lower blood sugar, including American ginseng, holy basil, gymnesta sylvestre (spelling?), and others.\u00a0\u00a0I have noticed the blood sugar lowering effect of holy basil, which I take to control cortisol levels.\u00a0\u00a0But since I don't have a blood sugar problem I know about, I've never tried to measure the effect.\u00a0\u00a0Cinnamon is also antibacterial and antifungal, though it's effects aren't powerful; it's thought that cinnamon and the other ingredients of curries were originally used for that purpose, to kill bacteria to make food safe to eat, rather than for taste.",

            "answer": "Thanks, I will try cinnomon. If I get capsules, do you know how much most people take per day for lowering glucose.I asked about the holy basil too in the past - have not tried it yet. Cinnamon sound so simple and a natural first step.My glucose is in the pre diabetic range 100-110. As an autoimmune Hashimoto patient, Diabetes can happen more common, totally regardless of your physical condition.DRs are so pathetic!They say I dont have diabetes YET. Like their waiting for it to happen before they get concerned. They dont get prevention do they??",

            "answer": "As you see above, I'm in the pre-diabetic range. My glucose hovers 99-110. Fasting or non fasting lately it makes no difference.\u00a0\u00a0I dont seem to have the very low glucose 'swing' problem that some diabetics have.\u00a0\u00a0I seem stable at a higher level than I want to be.I also have Hashimotos - linked to diabetes (the two go hand in hand, common), that is the only reason my endo can see that I have pre -daiabetes.I do not have the typical Diabetic body or unhealthy pre-diagnosis diet the most diabetics have. Am health mined (always was), never had fat, was a successful endurance athlete for years. 43ysr, 175, 6 ft, built like a 25 yr old swimmer. Eat good too. There are NO sweets in my house. One soda pop per week. I still exercise more than average. So this *****! You get the picture.My lipid panel and cardio (had test) is very good to for a 43 yr old.I has asked about supps on the diabetes board - there not into general heath over there- its all about their meds. And they just assume I'm fat and eat bad -guess that's what they see over there. I am trying to reverse this before glucose gets over 124 - thats diabetes.1) DHA is also a suppliment in tablets/capsules right?I used to take fish oil pills - burping fish is gross. I use very little cooking oil, I eat pretty bland. Eating is not a sport to me.\u00a0\u00a0If I ever want butter- I use canola oil butter.2)How is extra virgin olive oil?All this is why I ask about supps - I covered everything else, nothing else can be done at this point.I will look into R-lipoic acid some more. Have seen good reports on this. The local chain supp store did not have it, maybe the independent one will. Sound like its best to use this with a blood glucose meter. It time I ask my doc for one - sometimes they are free.",

            "answer": "It's tough to use herbs when you have diabetes anyway -- especially Type !.\u00a0\u00a0Because you have to monitor your blood sugar, using herbs that lower blood sugar require a lot of monitoring, and if people don't do it they can go too low.\u00a0\u00a0As for you, Gym is right, diet is by far the most important factor.\u00a0\u00a0It and exercise will determine if you go diabetic or not, not the thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Personally, because you have the Hashimotos, I'd consult a naturopath and a physician who is open to herbs.\u00a0\u00a0Lowering blood sugar too much can affect your hormone production.\u00a0\u00a0Notice how Gym mentioned fish oil?\u00a0\u00a0That's partly because the proper cholesterol manufactures our hormones, and sugar metabolism must be somewhat balanced for that to happen properly.\u00a0\u00a0As for how much cinnamon to take, I can't tell you, because I can't measure your blood sugar -- it depends on how much you need to lower it or whether it needs lowering at all.\u00a0\u00a0So I'm deferring to the professionals here.\u00a0\u00a0Just know you have picked a very useful herb for the purpose you're researching and one very well researched.",
