            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Many a times AST (SGOT) and ALT OR SGPT (both are collectively called transaminases) rise without any cause. Because AST is found in many other organs besides the liver, including the kidneys, the muscles, and the heart, having a high level of AST does not always (but often does) indicate that there is a liver problem. For example, even vigorous exercise may elevate AST levels in the body. However to reach at that conclusion the medical causes of these raised transaminases have to be ruled out. Causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. Steatosis and cirrhosis are ruled out by the ultrasound. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia and thyroid disease, can also cause liver transaminase elevations. Most liver diseases are characterized by greater ALT elevations than AST elevations except cirrohsis and alcohol abuse. So alcohol abuse is ruled out in your case.Raised alkaline phosphatase is often found in a growing child and at puberty. There are several bone disorders too that can raise this enzyme like rickets, osteomalacia, Paget\u2019s disease of the bone, tumors, metastasis and recent fracture.In your case only alkaline phosphate is raised really high. Since you also have fatigue get Vit D levels tested. Also it could be anemia, thyroid or parathyroid gland disorder.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. So please discuss with your doctor.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi All, for some months now, i have been having these terrible fatigue, coupled with headaches, sometimes, insomnia and the rest and all these symptoms developed since I put to bed on November 17, 2009. As a result, i went to do a general test, and the result of my liver enzymes tests sounds alarming. the results follows: Bilirubin (T) 0.33 mg/dl, Bilirubin (D) 0.05 mg/dl, ALK. PHOS. 260 U/L, GAMMA G.T. 120 U/L, SGOT (AST) 75 U/L and SGPT (ALT) 260 U/L. the results shows i have elevated levels of GAMMA,SGOT AND SGPT which they say may be as a result of alcohol of Hepatis. But the funny things is the result of my Hep tests are all negative and i dont drink at all. what could have caused the liver enzymes elevated like that. i did scan and the result shows my liver is mildly enlarged. What else will i do, am concerned, as its affecting my activity and i cant really take good care of my baby as a result. very often i feel tired, and sometimes i feel okay. could it be my hormones going back to normal after birth, or should i be worried about the result.",
