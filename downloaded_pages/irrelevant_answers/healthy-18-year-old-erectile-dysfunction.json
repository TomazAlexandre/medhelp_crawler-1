    "question": "I'm exceptionally healthy, I exercise regularly both by running and anaerobic activities with and without free weights. I take great care of my diet and regularly meditate and do recreational outdoor activities such as archery and recreation swordsmanship. Throughout my youth I've read a decent amount of material on sex and sexual activity and have felt and proven myself more than competent in pleasing a woman ( at least orally. )However, I've always had an issue with getting and maintaining an erection with my girlfriends. Nothing -anywhere- on the internet or with any health professional I've spoken to has suggested a reason. I've never been traumatized, I'm not anxious, I'm not stressed, I'm not unhealthy, i'm not low on testosterone ( I've had blood tests done ), I get enough sleep, every typical reply to these inquiries doesn't apply to me. . . Can anyone help?",
