            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.Pre diabetes is a condition where the blood glucose levels are higher than what is considered \"normal\" but not high enough to make the diagnosis of diabetes. The tests used to make this diagnosis are blood glucose test and a glucose tolerance test. Has your doctor done either of these? There are no real symptoms of pre diabetes. The symptoms of diabetes include frequent urination, thirst, blurred vision, numbness/tingling in the distal extremities, fatigue, slowed healing of cuts, and frequent infections.Peripheral neuropathy is a condition frequently found with diabetes. The symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are pain, numbness, and tingling sensations in the distal extremities. The tests your doctor has suggested are what commonly are used in the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. If you are experiencing numbness in your hands and feet, you need to be especially aware of any cuts/bruises that you receive. You want to frequently check your feet for cuts to prevent infection.I would recommend speaking with your doctor to find out what is leading to the suspicion of pre diabetes. There may be a lab value that you were unaware of. If you have not had a glucose tolerance test, ask if you doctor feels that it might be helpful. You have stated in your question that you are already exercising, watching your diet, and a non smoker. These are all good steps to maintain your health. Speak with your doctor about anything else you could be doing to prevent your condition from progressing.I hope this helps. Good luckCathy",

            "answer": "I went to my GP and he sent me to neuroligist.I was having numbness and tingling in both feet and severe pain in both calfs and thighs after walking 8-10 minutes on hard surface, but I can work for hours in the yard, as long as it is not on a hard surface.When I went to the neurologist he examined me and did an evaluation. I brought results of blood test (CBC, Comp Meta Panel, B12, Thyroid) he ordered other blood tests that I listed in prior post.In the 'Impression /Plan' he says 'the patient needs to be constantly watched for blood sugars because neuropatyh can present two to three years prior to diagnosis of diabetes.I have a copy of his evaluation and the only negitive issue he points out is 'decreased pinprick sensation distally and proximally'. I'm not sure what that means.If I pinch or tap my feet, calfs or thighs I have feelingThanks",

            "answer": "\"NON of that precludes you from getting diabetes.\"I'm just curious, but if a non-smoker with no family history of diabetes that exercises 4-5 times a week is still considered at risk, then what type of person do you consider not at risk for diabetes? It seems fairly clear that diabetes is highly correlated to obesity and genetics, but since you were so stern with your statement, I must be mistaken. Please, teach me...",
