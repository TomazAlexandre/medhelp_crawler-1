            "answer": "both of my parents are diabetics, and it if you have parents or any other family with this disease you are at a higher chance of becomeing diabetic then someone who doesnt have a family history. you mentioned going to the bathroom alot that is a sympton, as well as wounds that dont heal as quickly as the should, staying very tired all the time, always wanting to drink someting especailly wanting water more so if you just drank a pop or something sugary. if you are overweight you are t an incrase as well as the older you get to becoming diabetic. you can have eye trouble, you are at a muvh greater risk of geting golcoma, an eye disease tha slowly blinds you, there are eye drops to take for this thought. my mom has glocoma and she takes 2 differnt eye drops t slow it down. if you are over weight the you legs, knees, feet will hurt more swell more because of fluid build up there and as well becasue of your wegiht. now slimer people are just as likely to become a diabetic it just up the anty so to speak if you are heavy.im heavy and i have a strong family history for tr this disease and ive had an aunt and uncle to lose the sight lose ablity to care for thier self and lose a leg up to his knee. if you think you mabe diabetic PLEASE go to you doctor they can do blood work and other tests to see if you have ot or not. its a very serious and dangerous disease, and if not properly controlled (not to scare you, just tell truth) can lead to loss of limbs or death. oh... so far im not a diabetic, but once a year ill have my sugar checked. it only takes a second just a little ***** on your finger to draw out a drop of blood and the meter then will tell you what you sugar or glucose level is. that would be a first step for you ask your doctor about checking you suger. even if you had no family members you know of thats got or has had diabtes still have your sugar checked once a year. the disease can skip genrations. if you do have it dont panic its not a automatic death sentence by any means, you just watch what you eat, take you medicine, exercise, and you'll be fine. i hoped i helped you some. apartin",
