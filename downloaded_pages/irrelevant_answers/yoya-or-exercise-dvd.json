            "answer": "Hi, I have been doing a dvd pregnancy program & finding it really good in helping me maintain a healthy weight. I just started getting really into it in the last week since being diagnosed with gestational diabetes at 14wks. I try to do it daily as I need to stay active to help regulate my blood sugars. I also incorporate afternoon walks.",

            "answer": "Hi sorry been off the radar for a bit. I do a dvd pregnancy program by Pure Beginnings called Lean Mum2Be. I am in Australia & this program was founded here but it is available through their website I believe worldwide. I am trying to stick with it at least a few mornings a week. I also do 3km walks about 3 times a week & my home treadmill I just purchased is great to jump on for 20mins here & there :) My GDs (gestational diabetes) has really kept me motivated. I have been able to stay about the same weight for 4wks.",
