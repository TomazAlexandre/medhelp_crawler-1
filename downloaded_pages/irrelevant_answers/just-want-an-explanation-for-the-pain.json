            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Have you been tested for diabetes? You did not mention this. Diabetes too causes similar problems. Another possibility is fibromyalgia. Too much anxiety too can precipitate such symptoms. Migraine can be treated with medicines that can help prevent an attack. Certain antiseizure medicines like Depakote and Topamax seem to prevent migraine too. Also certain anti depressants like amitriptyline, nortriptyline etc are known to prevent migraines. Maybe you could discuss this with your doctor and change the prescription of drugs you are taking. Beta blockers too help in preventing migraine attacks.Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "I have been tested for diabetes and my blood sugar is normal. My mother was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and CFS about 10 years ago and I know we experience many of the same symptoms. I mentioned this to my PCP but he didn't take the idea into consideration.I have taken a few different medications for the migraines over the years with mixed results (some are effective but make me to sleepy to work and others gave me terrible nosebleeds) but my new PCP has yet to prescribe anything -even Imitrex or Frova- because he thinks \"It's unnecessary to prescribe medications before we actually find something wrong\"",

    "question": "Sorry for the re-post, I think I originally put this in the wrong forum.I am a 24 year old female with debilitating migraines(2-3x per week in frequency), crepitus in joints but more severe in shoulders, muscle pain, weakness and stiffness, neuralgia, tingling and numbness in hands and fatigue. I have had migraines with aura for about 12 years but all of the other symptoms started about 2 years ago. I have had an EKG, EEG, CT scan (for the migraines), and have been tested for thyroid disorders, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances but all tests have come back normal. My PCP suggests that the symptoms are psychological and could be the result of anxiety but I know this is not the case and I feel like most doctors give up when they don't find an easy explanation.I've tried home remedies such as heat/ice, OTC medications, relaxation techniques, etc. with no improvement.Thanks in advance for any help or advice!",
