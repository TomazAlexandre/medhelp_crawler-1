Teenage girls are already vulnerable to Eating Disorders and extreme dieting etc. Type 1 diabetics often have an unhealthy relationship or emotions regarding their body and diabetes.I can't say what's going on with your daughter but you should be aware of this issue so you can watch for signs. Talk with her Dr and see what advice or resources they can refer you to.Hopefully the camp will help but I would recommend you get her into some counseling, so she can work through her feelings about having and living with diabetes.",

            "answer": "I was diagnosed at age 3 and am now a 25 year old husband and father. I was doing the same things your daughter is and now I'm messed up big time. For me the problem wasn't that I felt weird or anything, I just didn't care, I didn't really feel any physical effects of high blood sugar and was not mature enough to realize that most of my emotional problems were related to those highs. My parents sent me to camps and tried to tell me why I should take care of myself but being in a wheelchair at 25, not being able to take care of my son or provide for my family, being sick 24/7 and in extreme amounts of pain, not sleeping, having b.m.s only every 4-5 days and not being able to control my numbers even when I wanted to, did not fit in with what I was imagining my future held, so I didn't care. I'm not sure I could have been convinced to take care of myself because of future consequences and most camps and workshops just turned me off even more.I don't mean to scare you, but this is one of the most important things in her life and could very possibly ruin it. As her mother you are the only one with the authority to stand over her and watch her check her blood and do her injections, keep her home if she can't go out without going sugar crazy. She may hate you but you could save her life. hopefully she will eventually learn to do it herself.",
