            "answer": "You should always seek a second opinion if your judgement indcates that. The one variable that would indicate that her condition might not be pollakiuria (which, as you already know, does not warrant any particular worry or alarm) is the length of time it has persisted. Generally, though your daughter may be an exception, the condition does not persist for as long as six months. Has the medication been helpful, or have you not wanted to start her on it? Aparently the doctor thought you were referring to polyuria, which refers to the passing of a large volume of urine within a specified time period. With your daughter, the issue is not so much the volume, from what you indicate, but the frequency of urination. It doesn't sound like the doctor understood what you were talking about. But definitely seek a second opinion, preferably from a pediatric urologist.",

            "answer": "Is she overall very petite person--just wondering because her weight is on the light side for a girl her age--my little guy is 3 and he weighs 36 lbs and is in the 50% tile for weight and height....maybe it is a metablism thing where things are just going though her and the wieght height and everything is a contributing factor--does she actually pee all the time or just feels the need and doesn't go--I have no real insight to this other than maybe taking her to a urologist who specializes in these disorders versus the peditrician...Good Luck and hope you can find her some help",

    "question": "My 5 1/2 year old daughter has been making frequent trips to the bathroom (25-30 times a day) for about 6 months now.\u00a0\u00a0She has been tested for infection and diabetes which were negative.\u00a0\u00a0Her Doctor said she is having bladder spasms and prescribed Ditropan for her to take for a couple of months.\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned because he jumped into medicine right away and when I asked about pollakiuria he said the word was pollauria (which is sugar in urine related) and she did not have that.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter only weighs 38 lbs. and I am concerned about medicating her if it is only pollakiuria.\u00a0\u00a0Her frequent urination is disrupting her school day.\u00a0\u00a0I also don't think it's behavioral because she makes trips to the restroom during her favorite activities.\u00a0\u00a0I would like another opinion.....Thanks",
