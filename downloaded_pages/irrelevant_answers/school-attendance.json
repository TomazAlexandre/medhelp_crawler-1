            "answer": "Not sure of your solution to your problem. But my friend with a type 1 diabetic child of seven goes through the same thing and she even had him placed in a school outside her school district that handled diabetes problems better. She also said she looked for a doctor that would back her on absenses due to diabetes. It must be terribly hard on kids with diabetes where they feel so out of place which most kids yearn to blend in with the others. But i would recommend apeaking with her doctor and see what the doctor recommends. Hope this helps, bret",

            "answer": "Your child's diabetes is a disability that is protected under federal law.\u00a0\u00a0You need to contact the school system and get what's called a Section 504 plan in place to deal with the academic, attendance and medical issues.\u00a0\u00a0Here is a link that deals with 504s:\u00a0\u00a0http://www.diabetes123.com/504/\u00a0\u00a0I have been very lucky with my 8-year-old son.\u00a0\u00a0He was diagnosed two years ago, and his teachers and the school have been very accomodating. It sounds like your school needs to be made aware of the accomodations your daughter is entitled to.\u00a0\u00a0Now, it also sounds like your daughter was just diagnosed, which means you're probably getting constant guidance from her doctor.\u00a0\u00a0You'll reach a stage soon where you will feel more confident about making decisions on insulin amounts.\u00a0\u00a0Each child is different, and glucose levels can really vary because of exercise, illness and a million other factors.\u00a0\u00a0It's one of the most frustrating aspects of this disease.\u00a0\u00a0If your daughter is constantly low, you probably need to cut back on her insulin and/or change her diet.\u00a0\u00a0My son is supposed to have 50-60 grams of carbs at mealtime, and 20-30 at snacktime, so I'm constantly reading labels. Your daughter may also have entered the honeymoon phase, in which her body requires less insulin. Balancing insulin amounts and the carb ratio is something you'll learn.\u00a0\u00a0I was in your position two years ago.\u00a0\u00a0It's scary..but you do learn to cope. And the people from JDRF who officially answer questions here are patient and kind and VERY helpful.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck to you",

            "answer": "Annalise is right on.Have your doctor write a letter detailing the fact that this is a relatively new diagnosis, and that their cooperation in ALL areas of her treatment is not only appreciated, it is expected and required by law.Her mental/emotional care is just as important as her blood sugar levels as she adjusts to her disease.\u00a0\u00a0Write a letter to them yourself, stating that you are sure they wouldn't violate her rights knowingly, and you will expect compliance from this point on, now that they ARE aware of what her specific needs are.Good luck, and you are doing the right thing in standing up for your daughter.",

            "answer": "Other parents have reported that their child also feels less embarrassed and a little bit special in a good way, if the teacher has a small section on diabetes for the class.\u00a0\u00a0Even at a young age, an informed teacher (working the parent and perhaps the child) can take some of the fear, mystery & embarrassment out of it.Children ridicule what they don't understand and what they fear.I'm not a physician, but I hope this is another avenue to consider when you have the legal issues sorted out.\u00a0\u00a0See if you can find your local chapter of JDRF, where you & your child will meet plenty of other families and children who have worked out these issues already.\u00a0\u00a0The support & encouragement & brainstorming power is wonderful.I was dx'd as a teen and 35+ years later, I'm grateful to tell you I'm well and have a full active life & career.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes has been a part of me, but it isn't \"me\" and hasn't been allowed to get in the way of my goals & dreams.\u00a0\u00a0Your child can create that same path with your compassion & support.",

            "answer": "Hey to you! I went to the website with the 504 plans and read them with a knot in my stomach. When I was in school, I got into trouble and had to serve detention because I treated an insulin reaction in the hall instead of walking a long distance to the nurse's office or the cafeteria. I wish that I had known about this! That was in high school. I read through the requirements such as having sugar/juice on hand and the ability to use it immediately, and having insulin and BG monitoring on hand and being able to use it immediately and thought, wow. I can't tell you how many times I took a test when my blood sugar was low or high. I had to hide my bg/shot supplies at school for fear of \"reprisal.\" On another note, I would suggest that any parents directly involve their diabetic child in any discussion about her/him. I have memories of being talked about (funny low stories, etc.) and feeling humiliated, very angry, and violated. You might even consider having the child do most of the talking and interjecting when necessary to elaborate or at least let the child have her say in the matter. I can't tell you how important this is. Also, I would suggest that it is never too soon to involve the child in her/his own care. And try to respect this person as a person and not an illness. I have seen some neat things like meters that the child helps decorate (maybe brothers and sisters as well). That being said, parents of diabetic children are wonderful people and deserve respect even when they sometimes make mistakes, and they will. I have found that sometimes outside help can smoothe fears and help guide the behavior/ coping mechanisms of the family. I wish I had known such help existed when I was in public school. It could have saved a lot of heartache. Love to everyone.",

    "question": "What rights does my daughter have regarding her attendance at school? Recently found out she has juvenile diabetes Type1.. at 7 years old. I understand school policies etc. however I understand some of her issues may be emotional and dealing with the new disease. Yet, when she wakes in the morning it is especially hard on her to get up. Her insulin levels are low and some days stay low and have to be closely monitored. I know that she is embarrassed to go to the office and keep testing her blood and I don't want her to avoid doing that from embarrassment even though she realizes how important it is to do and must be done. The endocrinologist may be changing her insulin amounts again, however I am not able to take her to the Doctor everytime she has a hypo or hyper glycemic episode. I feel like the school understands her situation, however they will continue to inforce their rules and I feel I shouldn't have to keep attending meetings with the principal or a Truant officer. I know her attendance is important, yet I also do not have diabetes and when she tells me she doesn't feel well I have to take her for her word, yet I try to talk to her into going and tell her after her numbers are normal I am sure she will feel better which usually ends up with her in tears, crying and telling me how she just doesnt feel well. I am sure other parents have had similar issues so any feedback anyone has would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",
