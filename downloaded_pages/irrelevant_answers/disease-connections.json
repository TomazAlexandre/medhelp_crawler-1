            "answer": "Hi,It seems like rheumatologic conditions do run in your family, and possibly some hormonal as well(including diabetes).\u00a0\u00a0Cold feet and hands can be quite normal, but color changes may not be, so your daughter should be seen by a rheumatologist. In terms of her thyroid, I cannot comment too much on that without knowing her thyroid test results. She should probably also see an Endocrinologist(and Gynecologist) if she is not menstruating. Definitely continue your screening for diabetes, given your family history. If you do not feel like yourself, your primary care physician should be able to start an evaluation(with labs etc) to help figure out why, then send you to the appropriate specialist if needed.Take care.",

            "answer": "My daughters thyroid I think tested in the normal range but her Dr felt going on the meds might help her but it would be a lifelong thing once started since it will kill her normal thyroid function.\u00a0\u00a0I thought that was a pretty extreme suggestion, - have urged her to find another Dr.and NOT do this without another opinion'Thank you for your answer",

    "question": "My 75 yr old overweight mother had diabetes dxd in her late 40s.\u00a0\u00a0She is now in a bad way being a double amputee in a nursing home, little vision, vascular dementia due to mini strokes (thought to be the cause of death in her mother).......5 years ago my sister presented with polyarteritis nodosa....vessels in her legs were ulcerating.\u00a0\u00a0It thankfully cleared but supposedly may flare again and can be life threatening.\u00a0\u00a0I had early menopause at 35, suffer migraines and low libedo and energy, visual fluctuations, and because of this I worry about my daughter in her mid 20's who has Raynauds to the point where her feet started looking very red and dark as though gangrene could happen.\u00a0\u00a0She also has no period and just doesn't seem to get good answers from the medical profession.\u00a0\u00a0One suggested she go on a thyroid medication for the rest of her life which would kill her own thyroid function...?\u00a0\u00a0I am just wondering if our family troubles might be somehow linked....we all seem to have cold feet and hands but circulation is there.\u00a0\u00a0I get checked myself for diabetes yearly...I get a clear bill of health but just do not feel well and thought I would send my Q'sThank you.",
