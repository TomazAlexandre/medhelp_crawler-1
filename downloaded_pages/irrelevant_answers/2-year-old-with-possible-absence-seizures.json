    "question": "I am writing regarding my 2 year old son.\u00a0\u00a0For the past 3 months we have been trying to figure out what is wrong with him.\u00a0\u00a0It started when one morning he was just lying on the couch completely lethargic and unresponsive for 5 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0When I picked him up it was like picking up a wet noodle; he was completely limp.\u00a0\u00a0After a few minutes he started to interact more and began talking and walking around.\u00a0\u00a0Although he was very weak and had some sort of a twitch.\u00a0\u00a0He had a similar 3 minute episode later that same morning.\u00a0\u00a0I took him to the ER and by the time they saw him he was acting normal again.\u00a0\u00a0They drew blood just as a precaution and everything came back normal...aside from a blood glucose level of 208.\u00a0\u00a0At that point he was admitted to the hospital an monitored for Juvenile Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Everything came back normal.Over the next couple months his symptoms continued and others started showing up.....lethargy, fatigue, personality changes, slight twitching or tremors (occasionally), excessive thirst, occassional accidents around the house (he is potty trained), and night sweats.\u00a0\u00a0He has also been waking up during the middle of the night asking for water.\u00a0\u00a0Although all of these are symptoms of a diabetic ALL test have come back normal.\u00a0\u00a0It was not until this week that our doctor suggested that this could be neurological and that he could be having absence seizures.\u00a0\u00a0We have met with a neurologist and they ordered an EEG and an MRI.\u00a0\u00a0We have to wait 2 weeks before the hospital can get us in.My question is this.......at point are these seizures a medical emergency?\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to make unnecessary trips to the ER but I certainly want to make sure that my son is getting the care he needs.\u00a0\u00a0My fear is that he will have a seizure during the middle of the night when I am unaware of it.\u00a0\u00a0Is that possible?",
