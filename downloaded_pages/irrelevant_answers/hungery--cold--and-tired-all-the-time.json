            "answer": "No normal anaemia is not hereditary.The symptoms that you have just described in your last post \"I now am shaking like my hands keep shaking and i eat and it stops.\"\u00a0\u00a0This is very typical of hypoglycaemia.\u00a0\u00a0 Hypoglycaemia happens when the sugar levels in the blood steam drop low.It does not necessarily mean that you have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Hence it is a good idea to see your doctor and get checked out.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor arrange for you to have a glucose test, or a HBA1C blood test to check your blood sugars.Make sure that you do not go too long without having anything to eat.\u00a0\u00a0Always carry some biscuits or other sugary food in the event you get an \"attack\".\u00a0\u00a0But the best way to deal with this is to ensure that you eat small meals on a regular basis and have a healthy snack in between meals.We all have a thyroid, it is a question whether it produces too much or not enough thyroxin that can cause a thyroid problem.Make that appointment to see your doctor and get checked out - the symptoms you describe can very well be diabetes.Let me know how you get on.",
