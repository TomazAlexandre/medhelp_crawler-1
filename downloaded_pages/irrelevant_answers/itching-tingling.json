            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to parasthesia skin which is due to dysfunctioning of neurons and can occur due to nerve irritation also. It can be due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency, neurological causes or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar, vitamin B 12 and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. Animal protein is the richest source of vitamin B 12 and if you are a vegetarian then you may be having vitamin B 12 deficiency. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms improve. If the symptoms persist then get an evaluation done from a physician and also get nerve conduction velocity tests done to rule out any nerve irritation.",
