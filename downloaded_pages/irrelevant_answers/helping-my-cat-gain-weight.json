            "answer": "Yes, as Pip said???I have a friend with an elder cat who, too, was skin and bones.\u00a0\u00a0She began feeding him WET FOOD ONLY (if you do this, add it in slowly over a period of time to avoid gastric upset).\u00a0\u00a0It turns out kitty was severely hydrated and bounced right back. His horrible smelly skin condition has improved, as well.\u00a0\u00a0He is 16!I don't care what your Vet might tell you, they are not exactly educated in our animals diets; not their specialty, so they tend to repeat what the reps tell them to.\u00a0\u00a0This dry prescription food is NOT GOOD - kitty needs wet food...grainfree if possible.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sorry but I would eliminate the McDonalds unless rarely.We tried the Dry Buffulo treats - I wasn't impressed although the first ingredient WAS meat, but the second was Brown Rice, with the 3rd being Oatmeal!\u00a0\u00a0Pretty sure our kitties of old had a bit of trouble finding Oatmeal in the desert.\u00a0\u00a0We had our kitty off treats (Temptations) for months, then decided to try a 'better' kind - Blue Buffalo.\u00a0\u00a0She had not vomited for over 5wks, but all that came back with her eyes looking glassy and reactive...so the Blue Buffalo was eliminated as I believe she was reacting to the rice/oatmeal.\u00a0\u00a0WELLNESS CORE dry (if dry MUST be fed) is a good product without any grains or additives or fillers.\u00a0\u00a0The canned just says 'Wellness' with no mention of 'Core'.\u00a0\u00a0With your elderly kitty, he needs all the moisture he can get.\u00a0\u00a0I even go so far as to add a few drops to Jades wet food..not enough it's soupy, but enough so she's getting a few more drops of moisture.The sneezing...I would encourage you to wean off the steroids and start kitty on a Lysine product to help strengthen his immune system.\u00a0\u00a0The steroids are just a bandaid until you can find the underlying cause.\u00a0\u00a0I have a feeling it could be food allergies.We started Jade on Lysine for her herpes over 6mos ago, and there's been a noticeable improvement.\u00a0\u00a0If you are interested in the Lysine, I can give you a link to a place online called iherb.I really think with a few simple changes you might have a new kitty! :)Good Luck!\u00a0\u00a0Oh, and what of the thyroid?",

            "answer": "hi....the other two posters above gave you some very good info. at a grand age of 17 a kitty needs a very good diet, lots of protein and low on carbs(which most foods are loaded with) and Hyperthyroidism is very common especially in older cats...they do get a ravenous appetite yet continue to loose weight and waste away. your kitty really needs to have a good check up and his thyroid tested. here is a link with good info. good luck and keep us posted.http://www.catinfo.org/?link=felinehyperthyroidism#What_are_the_signs_of_hyperthyroidism_",

            "answer": "You're cat sounds like he's doing awesome for his age.\u00a0\u00a0It's great to hear how active he is.\u00a0\u00a0I love hearing about such an active senior kitty because that tells me he's got a good owner. =)I'm with the other 2 posters that asked about his thyroid function.\u00a0\u00a0And, also, one other thing you can ask about is possible diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The longer he's been on steroids, the more likely it is that he's developed this.\u00a0\u00a0Many people don't realize that steroids can induce diabetes, but it can.\u00a0\u00a0It can happen to people, too.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes was induced in our cat that received steroid shots for a few months.If you're cat is eating a lot, and still losing weight, then it is likely your cat has either steroid induced diabetes or a thyroid condition.Good luck and please let us know how he's doing.",

            "answer": "He too is fine...Blood work came back good. Eats a lot drinks a lot and plays with other cats. He does sleep a lot but is old so is expected. I split one can wet food a day between 3 cats and dry food throughout day. Anyone know if anything I can do to help him gain weight? He is getting smaller every month and looks like the size if my 3 year old cat.",
