            "answer": "My docotor did that to me with my last pragnancy in hopes that I would go into labor naturally. It didnt work. SHe did it a couple of times too. I ended up with induction (gestational Diabetes) I am hoping that wont happen this time (induction) but my doc routinly induces a week early with gestational diabetes even though last time I controlled my sugars perfectly. My son only weighed 6 lb 9 oz. So he wasnt big like most diabteic babies tend to be. Christie, do you kknow any ways to induce labor naturally?",

            "answer": "( for the ladies trying to induce labor) Some people also should know should that the baby won't come till he or she is ready. The nipple stimulation works if you close and it kinda puts things over the edge a little bit. However it is know to cause harder contractions in some women.The only thing that is know to actually work is sex. It stimulates the hormones that actually cause the real contractions. If it's your first one nothing will work till your cervix is thinned, so be patient as well, you wouldn't want something to be wrong with your baby because you got inpatient.",
