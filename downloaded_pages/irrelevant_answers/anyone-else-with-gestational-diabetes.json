First test this morning I was with the normal, but one hour after lunch my levels were suppose to be under 130 and I tested 144. I am going to have to see how the rest of the day plays out.\u00a0\u00a0I go back in a week and if my levels continue to read high 2 days in a row I will need to call the doctor. I hope that does not mean shots. I am so sick of shots.Nickieb85, yes I've heard that with a controlled diet I should be fine. I am keeping my fingers crossed that this will happen.szw2008, I failed both test the 1 hour and the 3 hour, I am not willing to take any chances.

            "answer": "Hi Lizzy_anne24,It has not been that hard to follow the diet; however I am sad and frustrated that I cannot control my sugar levels not even with the controlled diet. My numbers were all over the place since last Friday; but today they seem to be ok. I will meet with the dietitian tomorrow and also with the specialist to figure of if they will revise my diet plan and omit food or if I will need to go on insulin. That scares me, I hate shots. I had to get progesterone shots the first 12 weeks and it was not fun. Well if I must\u2026I must, I guess the doctor was not joking when he said that this would be the hardest last weeks for me. I hope that once they figure out what to do I will be fine. In the meantime I guess it\u2019s a good thing because I have not gained anymore weight so if I stay at 12 lbs well that would be awesome!I hope you do well on the diet. Oh and poking 5 times a day is not that bad.",
