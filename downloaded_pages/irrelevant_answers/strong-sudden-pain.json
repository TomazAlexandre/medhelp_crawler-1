            "answer": "Hi,How old are you?Do you have associated conditions like a heart problem, diabetes?Is there a history of stroke or aneurysms in the family?I suggest that you seek immediate consult with your physician for a thorough neurologic examination. A brain scan may be necessary to determine the cause of the headache.A headache that is sudden in onset without prior history of trauma or migraine requires further evaluation.Straining involves what is called the valsalva maneuver.This is characterized by taking a deep breath and exhaling through a clossed glottis ( opening of voice box).This increases the pressure within the chest and may cause changes in blood pressure and heart rate. Studies show that certain changes occur in the rate of blood flow within the brain when one does a valsalva maneuver.Keep yourself from doing the same exercises until a thorough work up has been done.Avoid lifting heavy objects or straining during defecation at the moment.Keep us posted regarding your progress.",

Now for me, \"Get yourself to the doctor or ER now.\"\u00a0\u00a0I can tell you that if it takes a precert to go to the ER tell phone rep your case was reviewed online by a respected MD and an insurance professional and your company will probably give you a precert pretty fast - fancy words called risk mitigation - I'm not a doctor but I want you to be safe and a quick c-scan is not a big deal.",

            "answer": "Hi,I do appreciate LifesAHeadache's comment and it helps that she has an experience with the insurance industry.As I have pointed out in my post, seek immediate consult with your physician. Waiting will not be of benefit to you right now since sudden acute\u00a0\u00a0headaches do\u00a0\u00a0require immediate attention.Some people have reported headaches due to creatine use but in your case a more serious condition has to be ruled out first before anything else is to be considered.",
