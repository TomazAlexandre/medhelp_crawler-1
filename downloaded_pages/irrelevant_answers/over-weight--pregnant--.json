            "answer": "I think most women are more nervous than excited with their first one. When a woman is over weight during pregnancy she still will gain a little weight. Your dr can advise you on how much. You can absolutely work out. It's actually recommended. Just stay hydrated with water and stop right when you feel tired. Don't push yourself. You can eat pretty much what you want. But stay away from soft cheese and fish high in mercury. Try to limit your caffeine intake. Really try to remember your prenatals. They are important. If you really can't remember them then eat as healthy as possible. As for the dr if you weren't comfortable for any reason then switch asap.",

            "answer": "I was in the same boat...I ended up losing 30 lbs without trying...I was just eating healthier and with cutting out the alcohol the pounds fell off. The dietician seemed concerned but the drs didn't they said it was my body trying to get to a healthier weight, I am now 7 months pregnant and still 15lbs below what I started at. Just eat healthy...was told baby will take everything it needs so don't worry! Be aware that being overweight puts you at a higher risk for gestational diabetes ( I have it ) it is not a death sentence but be aware that your risks may be higher...honestly finding out I had GD probably makes me eat better which makes me have a healthier weight and healthier baby. Work out (lightly) eat balanced meals and drink lots of water!!!! Good luck",

            "answer": "Yes, it is so normal to be super nervous and super excited.\u00a0\u00a0It's a big deal to be pregnant!\u00a0\u00a0Congratulations.Switch doctors quickly if you are going to because once you are established as someone's ob patient, it is hard to switch mid stream.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors will often not take someone else's patient once well into the pregnancy because liability and insurance reasons.My good friend is overweight.\u00a0\u00a0What is pretty normal for overweight pregnant women is that they don't gain much weight during pregnancy and some even lose a little weight.\u00a0\u00a0You are already consuming a large number of calories so this doesn't need to increase and if you begin eating more healthy, you will begin to see benefits from that in your weight.\u00a0\u00a0Take small steps.\u00a0\u00a0Eat less processed food, more fruits and vegis and lean protein.If you have been exercising, then you can continue.\u00a0\u00a0However, if exercise is new, run it by your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Start slow---\u00a0\u00a0walking every day can be a good place to begin.\u00a0\u00a0Now is not the time to begin dieting or anything like that.Well good luck hon!\u00a0\u00a0It's an exciting time in your life!",

            "answer": "I'm considered overweight, I'm 5ft3 and I weighed 187 pre-pregnancy. Im 27weeks 5 days and so far I have lost 11 lbs slowly. I won't say I'm on a diet I simply did what I should have been doing all along. I eat lots of fruits n vegetables, less carbs and fat. I don't starve myself I simply substitute carbs for vegetables. My baby is measuring right on schedule and I took the glucose test yesterday and I don't have gestational diabetes, which is great! Good luck!",

            "answer": "Find a Dr you like, it can be hard because being over weight the Dr will bring it up, I lost weight the first two trimester and only gained 13 overall. The second week after baby I was down almost 30. Walking after meals was a huge help not only with my weight but it helped with labor. I craved fruits and ate well. My prenatal vitamins made me super sick and after trying numerous kinds, my Dr pulled me off of them. I never had BP issues and tested negative for gd. Also I didn't show until I was almost 27 weeks and I was hard on myself because I just looked weird, don't do that lol.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and congratulations.",
