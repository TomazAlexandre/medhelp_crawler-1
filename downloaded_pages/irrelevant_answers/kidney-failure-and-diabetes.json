            "answer": "Hello my name is Krista nickname is Church I am 28 years old and had diabetics type 1 forever now actually since I have been 11 years old. Over years when i was in my teenager years i have done poorly taking care of myself and could not get a grip on it either then now in my 20's i am getting worst. I got something in 2006 still have no clus what it is and seems to be worsing pretty fast. I would go through what I call spells i would wake up out of nowhere with diaherra and almost fainting i would shake to death when my sugar was NOT low I would get a burning sensation all over my body as if i we're in a fire. Went to the hospital many times they would send me away because my blood results were fine. My diabetic docter checked my urine it was fine but I did have kidney failure at 33% lost. I do have neothpathy in my hands and feet. But now i am dizzy and feel as if i am really weak its driving me insane trying to figure this out. I managed to have a baby girl back in 2007 but never was suppose to have children due to my uncontrolled diabetes. She my daughter was 29 weeks she was really early but safe and doing well. I just ran out of answers docters seem to blame the diabetes as if they don't think it could actually be something else going on which YES i believe there is. I am scared and running out of hope. So i am so sorry for you're brother it is so sad. Diabetes is a scary disease and i believe they have cures but won't give them to us because if they cured all of us then they wouldn't have jobs.. Well thats how i feel.Sorry again and God Bless to all of youKrista",

    "question": "Don't know if I'm in the right place or not, but here goes...My brother is 56 years old. He was diagnosed with type 1 (juvenile) diabetes when he was about 12.His sugar levels have proved to be MOST complicated....very brittle and he was never able to get a good grip on it.His body has been thru so much!!! In 1996 he was ready for a kidney transplant; while testing for the transplant it was discovered that he needed a quadruple bypass, which he had done. Then proceeded to the transplant. After the transplant he got cancer (which he beat), he has had laser treatments on his eyes and is blind in one of them.Has congestive heart failure and retains major fluid. He has very poor circulation in his legs and can't feel his feet (but thank God they are both still there!) OKAY, I'm getting to the point...recently he had a stroke and was admitted to the hospital. His creatine was 1.9 when he was admitted and rose to 3 and continues to climb. They biopsied this kidney today and was told that it was diabetic decline and he is on the path to renal failure. Told that there is nothing more they can do. They are sending him home and now what happens???? Is there a time frame to all this???He is in a hospital about 3 hours away and I just don't know what to do. Thank God again, he has 2 daughters that live near the hospital so he can stay there as long as necessary.I guess what I'm asking is: Has anyone had any experience with situations like this? Does the renal failure come on fast??",
