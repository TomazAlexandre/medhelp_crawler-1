            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to obtain a history from you and examine you, I can not comment on a formal diagnosis or treatment plan for your symptoms. However, I will try to provide you with some information regarding this matter.You may be suffering from neuropathic pain. There are many causes of neuropathic pain. One common cause is diabetes. The treatment for neuropathic pain (pain coming from nerves) includes gabapentin and pregabalin, and medications such as elavil (which is an antidepressant but has actually been found to be helpful with neuropathic pain as well). There are other medications, but these are typically the first line.It is important to keep in mind that the treatment of neuropathic pain takes time to get the doses of medications to an optimal dose.I would recommend that you follow up with your primary care physician to discuss your options and symptoms.Thank you for using the forum, I hope you find this information useful, good luck.",
