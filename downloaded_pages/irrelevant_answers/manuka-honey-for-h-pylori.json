            "answer": "Hi Ted I have been suffering from acid reflux for about 8 years and have been on medication since until I discovered Manuka honey with IMF rating of 12%. It has ended my fight all these years as I believe the cause of reflux which is h. Pylori bacteria is being dealt with. I have come off the medication for about 3 weeks now and I am free from nausea and acid. I can truly testify to the Manuka and recommending to everyone.",
