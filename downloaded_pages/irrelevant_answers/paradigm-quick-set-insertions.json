            "answer": "I am the mom of a pumper, and before we switch insurances or pumps I called the insurance companies and found out what they paid for and how much so that I know what I am expected to pay.First of all I would find out if the dollar amount they are quoting you is for 1 month or 3 month supply.\u00a0\u00a0 Usually the pimp companies send you a 3 month supply at one time.I would also suggest that you check you policy - most policies pay 50% for DME supplies, but have a smaller co pay for diabetes supplies.\u00a0\u00a0The thing is when the insurance companies get the bill from the pump companies they process the claims as DMER at 50 % or what ever percentage is in the policy.\u00a0\u00a0If you call them and tell them that is diabetes pump supplies you will usually find out that they are paid at higher rate.Your human resources department can also help you with this.I recently had this problem.\u00a0\u00a0I had called and found out that my insurance would pay 100% for infusion sets, reservoirs and iv3000, but the IV prep and unisolve was paid at 50%.\u00a0\u00a0 When the pump company called to confirm they were shipping the supplies they told me I wou7ld be responsible for 50% of everything.\u00a0\u00a0I called them and told them they were wrong and they double checked me and I was right.\u00a0\u00a0You must reconfirm things.\u00a0\u00a0Cask your human resources department what your policy pays for diabetes supplies, and DME (durable medical equipment), and pump supplies.\u00a0\u00a0They will be able to get the best answers for you.I hope this helps. Good Luck",

            "answer": "have they ever paid? and how do insurance companies expect us to pay for this you would think that they paid for the machine they would at least pay something on the supplies and I'm getting worried b/c I'm a new pumper and I haven't had to get my supplies yet, however it is time and I'm just waiting for them to deny me.\u00a0\u00a0I just don't understand how they can get by with it....

            "answer": "I have argued with my insurance comp for months, but since the suppliers are listed as Durable Medical Suppliers, my policy does not cover it.\u00a0\u00a0Even though the insertions are not durable, it is somehow coded as durable since it comes from a durable medical supplier.\u00a0\u00a0BCBS finally has directed me to their prescrition department for mail orders.\u00a0\u00a0They say that if i can get a prescrition from my MD then it is possible they can get me a discounted price or a copay - but only if it can be mail ordered.\u00a0\u00a0They are not sure, yet. Checking my application and prescription info.This is on-going issue.\u00a0\u00a0Trying to find the quick-sets, MMT-399, any way that I can since I'm pretty sure I'll have to pay ful price.\u00a0\u00a0$140 is for one month supply.\u00a0\u00a0It is going toward my deductible ($1000), but not helping me now.\u00a0\u00a0When I meet the full deduct., it will be close to the end of the year and it starts over in Jan.\u00a0\u00a0I am very upset and almost at point of going back to needles, which I was taking at least 6 shots everyday and getting worse.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know which is better-getting into needles that I can afford and take my chances at other medical issues later, or staying on the pump and getting into the biggest debt hole ever and not being able to financially survive.There should be more info on these problems before buying pump.\u00a0\u00a0If I had known how difficult it would be before buying....I am willing to accept any suggestions at this point.Thank you.",

            "answer": "ask the insuance compay who they consifder as a participating supplier?\u00a0\u00a0first alsways ask for the supervisor. Most mail order companies sendy ou 2 months of supplies at a 2 month copay - so you acrually save money.\u00a0\u00a0see it the 140 a month or 3 month supplie.\u00a0\u00a0. It might cost more out of pocket at one time, but in the long run you will be saving money becasue you are getting 3 months for the price of 2, same with the test stripos etc.",
