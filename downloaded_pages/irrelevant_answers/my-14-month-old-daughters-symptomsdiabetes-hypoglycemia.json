            "answer": "hi there, you use different measures than we do in uk but juvenile diabetes starts with the blood sugars running extremly high pretty much all the time until insulin is commenced. there would also be ketones present. i think you should take your little one to the doctor for a thourogh physical, i dont think youll be able to relax about her otherwise. if its any help, the onset of juvenile diabetes is rapid and it quickly becomes clear that they are very obviously unwell, its very different from adult onset in that respect. good luck, im pretty sure shell be just fine but see the doc, take care louise",

    "question": "two months ago, my daughter had a viral fever of 104 that cleared up completely within 2 days.now, i have noticed that my beautiful 14 month old daughter is:constantly thirsty,most nights she will soak thru diapersand when she eats she sometimes will tremble.on occasion she seems to lose her balance and topple over from sitting up,about once every two weeks she seems to have a few minutes of not being able to focus her eyes properly,she has had diaper rash problems that I thought were just sensitive skin.she will sometimes want to take naps two times longer than usual,she wakes up very sweaty sometimes on cool mornings, but I had always thought that is due to the heat during the night (we live in georgia, with a window AC unit)....she is a tiny girl at 20lbs, but I had always thought it was genetics, my parents and sister and myself were all itty bitty, as was my husband...another reason I freaked was because the night before my Mother in law gave her ice cream and the next morning DD woke up and was extremely sweaty and lethargic, took her temp and she didnt have any sort of fever.now i am very very concerned about diabetes, as all of the symptoms are increasing gradually.I haven't taken her in to see a doctor, but bought a glucose meter and ketone strips...ketones were neg.yesterday at 4pm after her nap and just before dinner her number was 61,she then ate chicken strips for snack.at 615pm I tested again, it was 81then she ate sweet potatoes just before bed, after the sweet potatoes it was 74.this morning before breakfast it was at 58. (!!!)These all seem way too low for a non-diabetic....?!?!??is it most likely hypoglycemia? diabetes?I am confused!Thanks for any advice...",
