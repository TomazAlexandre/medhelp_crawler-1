If you have hepatitis C and a fatty liver then it increases the chances that the liver will become damaged more quickly. Also the medicines to treat HCV don\u2019t work quite as well if someone has a fatty liver\".",

            "answer": "I would agree with the above poster that \"steatosis\" (fatty liver is not a game breaker as it pertains to success when doing therapy for HCV,however their is documented evidence that patients with HCV genotype 3 have a higher incidence of\u00a0\u00a0\"fatty liver\" and that treatment can be somewhat less succesful\u00a0\u00a0with this genotype.(see link below)You have not mentioned your genotype so\u00a0\u00a0I do not know if this pertains to yourself.Best...WillThe increased relapse rates could be because of steatosis, and as already mentioned, the increased rate of fibrosis in thes patients. In a cohort of 932 treatment-na\u00efve patients, investigators of the ACHIEVE-2/3 trial [18] showed that hepatic steatosis significantly increases the risk of relapse independent of HCV RNA levels in patients with genotype 3 who achieve an RVR with IFN-based regimens. This may be because of altered IFN-\u03b1 signalling, increased intrahepatic RNA levels or increased quasispecies diversity. Other known risk factors for relapse are male gender, black race, age over > 40, increased viral load, presence of fibrosis, body weight > 85 kgs and presence of diabetes mellitus.",

    "question": "Does anyone know anything about steatosis when treating HCV? Is steatosis often a game breaker when considering tx? Is SVR compromised when treating HCV? Any thoughts or discussions would be great.",
