    "question": "Hi everyone! After at least 4 years of problems I have Hyperthyroidism. I'm on methimazole 20 mg a day Two in morning Two at night.Here's my test resultsthyroid stim hormone[L] 0.003 uIU/m1 normal 0.300-5.000free thyroxine {T4} [H] 3.1 ng/dL normal 0.7-1.9free Triiodothyronin [H] 9.4 pg/mL normal 2.8-5.3I know L and H mean low and high. I don't go back to the doctors for three months. So I have no other info on how bad the results are compared to the normal range. I've had the scan that's what these results are from.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor for this disease so far is good. It's a month the 13. Next Edema. The reason I went back to my reg doctor is because my feet in legs started to swell bad enough that anymore on the right foot in the skin would have broke open. Also the hair on my legs stopped growing. My doctor ran the test again Bingo you have Graves disease. How wonderful! Joke gotta make myself laugh. Now I'm worried the swellings back again. This time though it's also in the hands with tingling.. I've read up on it so I know the bad about it but need advice. what anyone else thinks\u00a0\u00a0could be wrong! I can handle bad news. Heart problems and of course thyroid run in the family besides diabetes Test results above can someone tell me what it means. Other blood test done wanting for the results to see if the meds are working right. Thanks in advance",
