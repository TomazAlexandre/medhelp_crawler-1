            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms could be due to a combination of the following problems: plantar fasciitis, diabetes, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, peripheral neuropathies (Lyme\u2019s lupus, diabetes, hypothyroidism etc), hypothyroidism, SLE, alcoholism, peripheral artery disease, sciatica, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis and high blood pressure. You will need blood tests, nerve conduction studies and dopplar studies to reach a diagnosis.Also, have you been tested for syphilis? HIV is ruled out. Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding these possibilities. Hope this helps.

            "answer": "Thank you so much I'm getting a nerve conduction test done and a lot of others tests done. I'm freaking out because the only things that come up when I look up burning feet and hands, sebboric dermatitis, blurred visioon and white tongue are HIV. I'm scared that something is wrong with my immune system and it's my creating antibodies against hiv. After 7 months my test is negative but that's what I'm worrying about. I read in here about someone who testerd negative and then did a viral load and it was positive. Is t possible I could have advanced to aids within 6 months? I'm so scared I don't know of any other medical issues that would cause all these problems besides hiv. Please help me. Thanks!",

    "question": "For the past 6 months I have been suffering numerous symptoms all after a sexual encounter. All stds are ruled out since I've been tested for all. I have a lot of neurological symptoms. I\u00a0\u00a0a female 22 years old and been having my extremities fall asleep very easily, twitching all over body, muscle weakness and achiness, burning feet, slightly blurred vision, and my head feels numb. My lower back has a lot of discomfort around to my hips and so does my spine... Besides the neurological symptoms I have no appetite at all, white in back of tongue, scalp that peels, and my skin is very sensitive and gets these lines and marks very easily. I'm petrified that I have a serious neurological disorder like MS or I have an auto immune thing going on. I had a lot of blood work done that was all normal. I hope these things are reversible and now I'm scared that the std tests for hiv could be negative because my immune system is sum how damaged and not producing antibodies. I've tested after 8 months with a 4th generation test and it was negative I hope I can rule that out. I'm just scared this is something really serious and now one is able to figure it out. Please help me!!! I can't take this weak feeling in my body anymore and all the other symptoms.",
