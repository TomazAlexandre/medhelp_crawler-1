            "answer": "Hello,Thankls for writing the symptoms in detail.On reading your symptoms carefully,I feel that the light headedness is due to generalized anxiety disorder.Anxiety and panic attacks commonly cause such dizziness and light headedness.Also you need to get your blood sugar evaluated as diabetes has often been associated with polyphagia(increased hunger) and dizziness.At such a young age,having other neurological pathologies which can cause such symptoms is rare.Your symptoms are pointing towards the diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder. Treatment includes cognitive behaviour therapy and antianxiety medicines.I sincerely advise you to consult a psychiatrist and get yourself evaluated for anxiety.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or in case you have any additional doubts.Kind regards.",

            "answer": "I think it would be great to see a doctor regarding eating assosiated with relieving the dizziness. Maybe you are not obsorbing the nutriets prperly. I would look into it as some people naturally don't absorb nutriets like myself so I get vitamins injected into me and it instantly relieves my\u00a0\u00a0dizziness. I do have natural low blood pressure which can cause or contrubute to dizziness/light headed.I hope things get betterJen",

    "question": "I am 24 years old and I just started getting dizzy headed like 6 months ago. I haven't had any problems from it. My left side of my head hurts ever so often I think it might be from my bad teeth. Every time my head starts getting dizzy/light headed I have anxiety attacks like some bad is going to happen from it. Since this is been happening I started eating more and gaining weight. I eat cause it helps me when I get light headed. I don't have diabetes. Now all I do I stay in my room. I eat by myself. I don't like to be around people cause what they might say or think. I go out in public but don't like to stay long cause I start having anxiety attacks and start thinking people are staring at me and saying things about me. I start getting hot and sweaty and have to step out side get some fresh air. I also can't stand still and I move around a lot. I start bending up and down. I think I also have social anxiety too. I want to work but don't cause I might get dizzy/light headed and start having anxiety attacks. I don't even drive because of this problem I have. I use to work all the time and go out in public with no problems. I loved going out and doing stuff. I don't know what happened to me, I want to know what I can do to see why I am getting dizzy\u2019 light headed and if there is some thing to stop it from happening again and never come back. I never had this problem. Would going to a head doctor be a good idea? I also want to know why I started getting anxiety attacks and how I can stop it completely. I know I might get it from being dizzy headed and gaining weight. Please help me cause I want my life back to normal. I don't want to be locked in my room and not come out. I want to have a family and I can if I can't find away to fix these problems. If anyone can help me please do. Thanks.",
