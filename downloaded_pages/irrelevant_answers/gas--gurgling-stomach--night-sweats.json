I have increased my caloric intake but it doesn't seem to be helping. I'm also exhausted by the end of the day.",

    "question": "I'm hoping someone may have some advice. I have a very healthy diet, get regular exercise - but I have a really bad problem with gas that builds throughout the day. I drink two travel size cups of coffee and chew a lot of sugarfree gum every day. The rest of my diet consists of yogurt, trail mix, granola bars, PB&J, fruit, and a lot of water. I can feel bubbles of gas popping in my stomach and sometimes fear that it will force itself out at the wrong time. I have BMs nearly every time I go to the bathroom.\u00a0\u00a0I also have frequent night sweats when I wake up drenched in sweat. HELP!",
