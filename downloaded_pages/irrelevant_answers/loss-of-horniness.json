            "answer": "Hi there!For a successful erection physical and emotional factors both play a vital role. An erection involves your brain, nerves, hormones, and blood vessels. Anything that interferes with either of this can lead to erection problems .Stress, fear, anxiety, anger all can lead to erection problems. Repeated feelings of guilt, doubt, poor communication with your partner all can lead to erection problems. Intake of medications like beta blockers, antidepressants, and diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, and multiple sclerosis all can lead to this problem. Try to evaluate yourself and discuss it out with your partner. A relaxed mind and a good foreplay should help. In case the problem persists seek medical help. Do write to us againBest luck!",

            "answer": "Hi, OK just how long ago did we stop the smoking and drinking, if its only been a short time then you still need some time, you could try some Tribulus its a herb that will boost your testosterone, lift your libido and kick your energy levels, add into this some Cayenne, mix this with some tomato paste and thin it down with olive oil, to the heat you can stand, and start making yourself some Green tea with honey and lemom, and a very good thing to add in to this is Ginger, Fresh is best, I keep mine in the freezer, fine grate a plie to the size of a large egg, micro wave this with the lemon 30 seconds, then put in your tea and honey.These last to will help your blood to your p***s.The Tribulus will take around 8 weeks to get to full power, and after that only take for 5 out of 7 days, and do the same with the other 2, these should help get you going again.Good Luck",
