    "question": "Has anyone else been diagnosed with geststional diabetes and feel it was the wrong diagnosis? I got diagnosed and I have been eating normal and taken two readings. I haven't met my dietician yet, but my levels have been 107 & 114. Thats after having pizza and soda. And lacking sleep, having stress, headaches, and being sick. Could it be possible I got misdiagnosed??\u00a0\u00a0I'm sick of hearing how I'm not suppose to have any soda or Pepsi, especially when it was only half a cup and my sugar wasn't outrageous!! Maybe I'm just sick of no it all's who want to run their mouths cause they got diagnosed with their pregnancies and cause they still ate tons of sweets now have kids with health problems. I don't eat lots of sweets. And my sugar was actually really low before pregnancy. If it was really high, wouldn't it have shown up sooner? I'm 29/3, I got negative on every urine sample for my glucose every month.",
