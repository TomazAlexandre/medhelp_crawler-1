    "question": "I been having small contractions ever since 1am and it's noe 10:37pm and the contractions are a little more painful but still not close enough like for me to go to the hospital. I'm 40w+2d as for today and at my last appointment which it was last Thursday I was completely closed not dilated or effaced at all. Those this mean that I'm progressing slowly? I still don't want to go to the L&D because I know they will send me home as my contractions are not that close. Any input will be appreciated.",
