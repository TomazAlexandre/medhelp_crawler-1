            "answer": "I have this issue too! To be honest with you, I dont know if they have anything to do with one another but I did notice when I went on a low carb high protein diet my symptoms werent as bad. Also caffeine makes my dizziness and lightheadedness worse. They days I dont have any caffeine my symptoms are still there, but when I do have caffeine they are 10X worse. Like I said I do not know if one has to do with the other but I have the same things going on.. My dr also said something about being insulin sensitive?",

            "answer": "I was diagnosed with insulin resistance at 21 and diabetes at 27. My drs think it's partly autoimmune in my case, but it could certainly be Chiari connected as well. The compression and intracranial pressure can screw up the pituitary gland, causing all sorts of hormonal problems.Watch your carb intake. That's the best thing you can do for pre-diabetes. Try to stick at or under 40 carbs per meal. Also, eat more, smaller meals or snacks that have a good balance of protein and carbs. My glucose levels are stellar now that I try to follow those guidelines. My Hubby recently decided to take care of himself, and has cut his calories, but especially carbs. He's lost 50 lbs in 2 months and his glucose levels have come down. His readings were high enough that over time, they would have caused serious complications, like blindness, amputation of his feet, etc if he didn't get them under control. I'm happy for him, but hate it so much! We eat the same basic diet. I still eat less than him, but my weight won't budge. My dr is testing me for Hashimotos now....finally.Good luck to ya. With the right dietary changes and exercise, which also lowers blood sugar and insulin resistance, you should be able to avoid full-blown diabetes, unless you have autoimmune components or Chiari is causing it.",

            "answer": "If you are hypoglycemic (low blood sugars) you need to be careful what you eat but you need to increase your intake of carbohydrate foods. Rice, potatoes, bread, tortillas, cereal, milk, fruit, and sweets are all carbohydrate-rich foods.If you are hyperglycemic (High blood sugars) you need to reduce your carbohydrate intake.Either of these conditions can be an dangerous but low blood sugars that drop under normal levels can lead to all kinds of problems, doing any exercise when your sugars are low will burn up more carbs and can cause your sugars to drop more, even to the point of inducing coma. I have had this experience with my partner who is insulin dependent, she has been in a coma in the past due to sudden onset hypo after taking insulin without checking her sugar levels, She has no Hypo awareness (most diabetics know if their sugars are drooping) so she needs to check before taking insulin. Normally the liver has a reserve of sugar in such an emergency but it is important to get treatment as soon as possable.I would suggest that anyone with low blood sugars should carry glucose sweets or glucose gel with them at all times.Hyperglycemia where the sugar levels go high can lead to a condition called Ketoacidosis witch is increased acidity in the blood, This condition is easily recognized by a sweet fruity smell from the breath of the person. This is an emergency for someone with high blood sugars and is common in type one Diabetes (Insulin dependent) witch is not treated or poorly managed.......Talk to your GP if you suspect you have any issue with your blood sugars, get them checked on a regular bases especially when you have an underlying problem like CM. I dont know if CM can cause Diabetes but it would not surprise me if it did.Ray",

I did not think to ask if it was related because I was overwhelmed and freaked out. All I could think was I am 22 how could this many things possibly be wrong with me. I was put on metformin 500mg 3x a day and test my sugars and it seems no matter what I eat or if I eat nothing at all they remain high all the time, it is frustrating.Were you refereed any where to be seen for the pre diabetes? I hope you can get some answers. Let us know if you find anything out and I will ask my doctors too know that you made me think about it.",

Diagnosed with chiari in June and now prediabetes and I'm beginning to wonder if I have experienced hypoglycemia and not panic attacks. My triglycerides were high good cholesterol low and bad cholesterol high blood sugar was 98 fasting and acl diabetic test showed 5.8 but when hypoglycemic are you supposed to eat carbs?? I love carbs and have had to eliminate them. Btw 6.4 is considered diabetic. And how do we know what kind we will end up with 1 or 2? It's a very confusing illness :(",
