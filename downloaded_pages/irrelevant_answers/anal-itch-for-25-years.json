    "question": "I have been a Type 1 Diabetic since age 6 and for the past 25+ years I have had a nearly constant itch in my anal area (on the web I see that the medical community calls this \"Pruritis Ani\").I have discussed this with my Endocrinologist with no resulting solutions.\u00a0\u00a0 I have done research on the web to understand possible causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment and self care.\u00a0\u00a0 I have stopped for weeks many of the possible food causes (caffeine, artificial sweeteners [Splenda, Nutra-Sweet]), I clean thoroughly after passing stools.\u00a0\u00a0I do all of the \"normal\" blood work on a quarterly basis and all results are in the normal range (except that A1C is slightly high).I have seen a dermatologist but they only suggested a cortisone cream. I have even gone to a Proctologist and had a colonoscopy.My hope is that someone on this community is aware of similar experiences and that you can recommend a means to get this resolved.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks in advance.",
