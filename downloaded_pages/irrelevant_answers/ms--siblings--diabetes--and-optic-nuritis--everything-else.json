IF IT HELPS WITH THE VISION, FEEL FREE TO USE ALL CAPITAL LETTERS LIKE THIS.\u00a0\u00a0SOME OF OUR MEMBERS DO AND AS A COURTESY WE TRY TO USE THEM BACK.Until I see for sure that this will help you I will type the normal way.\u00a0\u00a0First of all no one here worries about our speeling or typing problems.\u00a0\u00a0we can figure out what you are trying to ask or say.I'm so glad you found us over here - I don't know where Dr. kantor has been this week, but he's not answering his questions on the expert forum.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe he is off on an exotyic trip somewhere.It is so unusual for 4 of you siblings inyour family to have MS - some researcher somewhere should really want to get ahold of your tests and samples.\u00a0\u00a0Your theory about the autoimmune stuff and gene pool makes sense - my mother has psoriatic arthritis and my dad was dx'd with drug induced lupus about 15 years ago, but hasn't had any flares since then.\u00a0\u00a0arthritis runs amuck in my family on both sides.welcome again to the forum - I'm sure lots of people will be by later to comment on the uthoff's ....my best,Lulu",

I've had ON twice and so can really empathise.My baby sister (she 36 but I'm 54) was dx with RR MS about 18 months ago and her first sx was ON too.Don't know if this helps but I have 3 brothers and none of them have any sx.Welcome to the forum.Pat",

    "question": "Hi to Lulu, thank you for your help. Some days I just don't get it so thank you very much for your suggestion.Before I post anyhting else please note I have Optic Nuritus and am struggling with typing, seeing, spelling and generally making sense of the world in front of me.I was diagnosed with MS in December after I developed ON, this was the last of a long list of symptoms.I have 3 sisters who have all been dX with MS in the last two years. My eldest sister also has Type 1 diabetes and so do I. She has Second stage MS, sorry I forgot the words, she cant walk, see and has problems with tremors and swallowing.My ON came on at the start of winter (UK),when I turned my heating up and switched the fire on. My Doc suggsted it was heat related, I did start with it around Aug 08 but it wasnt all the time, just odd days and to be truthful i'd forgotten about it. I have the other bits, dizzy, numb leg, fingers, hands, lip and patch on head (intermittant).1) I always feel cold, and can never get warm, hence I have my heating on full blast. Do other people who have Uthoffs thingy fell hot or cold?. I dont know for sure that I've got utohfs but my doc said he thought I may have althoughhe isnt my neuro doc.2) does any otehr member of this forum have siblings with MS, my neuro says its unusual to have so many. For me its always been that way I get diabetes, then my brotheer gets it then my sister gets it, thanks Dad. One of my MS sisters has psoriaisis this is also an autoimmune condition from my dads side of the family. Very bad gene pool i think.Many thanks in advanceRuby.",
