            "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I am a patient with Lupus that required Prednisone therapy during pregnancy. In the fifth month and at that dosage I would not worry too much. Ask the OBGYN if she can just take 20mg in the morning though because taking 10mg at night may cause her to have problems sleeping.\u00a0\u00a0Was the doctor able to determine what triggered the Bell's Palsy? Was your wife checked for gestational diabetes, high blood pressure etc?Symptoms should subside between 2-6 weeks if she indeed has Bell's Palsy.",
