            "answer": "Oh boy do I have a problem with anger sometimes. I am a High School Teacher and it is really bad symptom for me to have for obvious reasons. Sometimes I just feel the heat rising to my face and I absolutely let rip!! The smallest thing can tip me over the edge and the really scary thing is that sometimes I just can't calm down.I'm glad you're feeling good today :-)Mel",

    "question": "Good Morning to All!!! I am so happy right now!I went in yesterday to get a visual field testing and pictures of the optic nerves.\u00a0\u00a0Now that was interesting. For the pictures you look in this machine stair at a green dot that for me turns red. I have a problem with lights they turn red when I stair at them. Then a bunch of little lights swirl around and a picture is taken. Then the field testing you look in another machine and watch for flashing lights and when you see them you push a button. Well I had a problem with the right side. I saw the lights but had a problem telling my left hand to push the button. By the time I pushed the button at least 3-4 more lights have flashed. I told the 2 eye surgeons that were working with me. So we looked at the the test and yes there is a question on the right eye. The eye surgeon told me to make sure I tell the neuro about the problem. But everything else looked great. Oh yeah they even dilated my eyes. I told the eye doctor maybe now I'll be able to walk better. The joke is I have trouble walking so with my eyes dilated maybe it would trick my brain into thinking it is normal. We had a good laugh. Good news I have had diabetes for 27 years and\u00a0\u00a0if you had to diagnose me by my eyes the test would be negative for diabetes, my tears are very clear, nothing wrong. Just a black dot that comes and stays for awhile. Since one of the eye surgeons lives just down the road from us. He told me to call him when this happens.I am so happy. I can handle losing everything else but not my eyes. My sister lost her eyes and she has a hard time.Right now I'm trying to eat and have my coffee before 7:30am. I have to fast for 6 hours before my next steroid treatment.Does anybody have anger issues? My poor husband last night had to put up with mine. Out of the blue I just started yelling about everything it lasted for a while then it was gone. Maybe I was just over tired. My legs and my left arm felt like I had just lifted 100lbs over and over. Is this normal?I may not be around after Sunday for at least 2 weeks. I will have my son and his wonderful wife and their 2 kids. They are moving\u00a0\u00a0far far away. We get to have the 2year old who will be 3 in November and the 10month old while they move their stuff. It should take them about 2 weeks. I can't wait. I really love my grand babies. And my daughter n law I can see why my son fell in love with her.To every one you all have a great day and hope to hear from you all.Eliza",
