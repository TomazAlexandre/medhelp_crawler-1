            "answer": "Hi Amy,It's great that you're doing pre-pregnancy planning because that will give you the greatest likelihood of success -- for your baby AND you.\u00a0\u00a0It's a good idea to find a obstetrician who specializes in high-risk pregnancies and to work with a team who's well-versed in the complications & issues that diabetic moms must wrestle with.I understand that larger babies can be the result of poor glucose control that ultimately requires the BABY's insulin production to be elevated in order to counteract the MOM's high BGs.It's good you're aiming to lower your a1c, since you're creating the environment in which your unborn child will develop.\u00a0\u00a0Many DM women are advised to have VERY tight control in the months prior to conception and to maintain those through out the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0In other forums, I've read, for example, that post-meal BGs should not rise above 140.Read read read and work toward ensuring you can make the commitment needed to have a successful pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0There are many diabetic women who've been successful carrying their children to term; there are many miscarriages and complications, however, too.\u00a0\u00a0The odds are much more in our favor when we're in as close to \"non-DM\" control as humanly possible. I'm also sure you'll get more info from this site, so do check back.",

            "answer": "amydivin,I am glad to hear that you are taking the necessary steps and planning that you are already doing in order to have a successful pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Years ago the complications were much greater in women with diabetes trying to conceive.\u00a0\u00a0Researchers have made great strides in the past several years.\u00a0\u00a0Even with that in mind, there are still risks involved.\u00a0\u00a0It is very important to get in touch with a doctor who handles high-risk pregnancies just to ensure the best result for you and your baby just as LRS stated.\u00a0\u00a0She gave you some great information to follow.\u00a0\u00a0Just keep working on lowering your a1c and keep a close eye on your diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0As LRS said, do your homework and read all you can.\u00a0\u00a0Please come back and keep us posted.Thanks.",

    "question": "I have had diabetes for about 9 years and have been on an insulin pump for about five of those.\u00a0\u00a0I would not know what to do without the pump, I love it!\u00a0\u00a0My husband and I are anxious to become parents, but I am very nervous about pregnancy having diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I was wondering if anyone had any advice, especially those who wear pumps...\u00a0\u00a0I have heard about a complication that causes the baby to be born large, has anyone had this complication, and does it go away??\u00a0\u00a0Do most women have to have c-sections at delivery?\u00a0\u00a0My last HA1C was a 8, and I have been working hard to lower it, I think my hardest area is exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Any advice is greatly appreciated!",
