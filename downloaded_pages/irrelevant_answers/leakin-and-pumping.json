            "answer": "Do NOT pump, your baby needs that colostrum! Wear breast pads for the leaking and yes it is normal. Nipple stimulation can cause labor to start but you are way to early if you are thinking about self inducing. Hope this helps",

            "answer": "If your boobs hurt you can squeeze a bit out but don't pump. Also a very hot wash cloth pressed on your boobs for a few minutes helps wonders. When you take hot showers you can always press from the top of your boob until you hit your nipples and that will make them release pressure also. Hope it helps.",

            "answer": "Actually, u can start expressing it and freezing it at 32 weeks as long as it doesn't give u pains or anything. And the more you express it the more you'll make, that's why alot people do it, is to increase the milk supply",

            "answer": "It actually doesn't increase milk supply, how much milk you produce is based after delivery the supply meets the demand of your baby. Some women do save their colustrum mainly if they know ahead of time their baby might need to be formula fed at first,for instance women with gestational diabetes who's babies may have unstable glucose levels after birth. Though for every bottle of formula fed to baby,you also need to pump so your body keeps producing milk. While it can be used for instances like this, it is still not recommended to pump before birth.",
