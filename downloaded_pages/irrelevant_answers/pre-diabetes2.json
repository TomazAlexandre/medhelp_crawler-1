I have NOT yet been diagnosed with diabetes (I will have the results soon), but my doctor is pretty sure it is, and if not, it's pre-diabetes (type 1).If it's pre-diabetes, I was wondering if there is anything I can do to reverse it?I'm 18 years old, I eat fairly healthy ... I weigh about 110 pounds (I lost about 5 pounds) , and I'm about 5'5, so losing weight is not an option !Thank you",
