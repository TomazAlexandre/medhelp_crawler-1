    "question": "I am a healthy active 36 year old male, non-smoker, and good diet with no family history of urinary cancers.\u00a0\u00a0About 4 weeks ago, I noticed that I had to urinate more frequently, maybe up to 12 times a day (although I only get up maybe every 3rd night to go).\u00a0\u00a0Although I feel the urge more when I am lying in bed at night.I went to my internist who did a urinalysis, and found no blood in the urine, and no infection.I then went to my urologist who did another urine sample, and found traces of blood, and so he ordered a CT scan, which showed nothing.He know wants to look into my bladder with a cytoscope, to check for cancer cells in the bladder.He says that because of my age, and good health it is not probable that I have bladder cancer, and that many people can experience these symptoms without having cancer.I have two questions:1. Since we have ruled out infections, stones, solid tumors, what else could it be but bladder cancer?2. Is he correct that given my symptoms it is still unlikely to be cancer?Thanks.Jason",
