            "answer": "Hi I can't answer your question but hoping someone else can as I am in a similar situation. I had a 15cm cyst, right ovary, tube and appendix removed on Mon 17th Jan. I had no bleeding at all after the op but a week later on Mon 24th my period started, a week earlier than it would normally be. It is still just as heavy now, 4 days later, bright red blood. I have no cramping tho. Would like to know if this is normal or if I have pulled or damaged something inside!",

            "answer": "Yes, it is normal to have your period be different following surgery.\u00a0\u00a0It can take about 3 months for your cycle to get back to normal.\u00a0\u00a0If you get severe pain or unusually heavy bleeding then you should call your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise, it is normal to have this change following surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes for continued healing!Shelly",
