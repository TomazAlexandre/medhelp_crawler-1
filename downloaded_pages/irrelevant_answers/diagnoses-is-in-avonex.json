            "answer": "I think a lot of people on the site can absolutely understand meeting this diagnosis with relief. It's like after running around the field with nothing to do and getting trampled by linebackers someone's finally thrown you the ball and you know exactly where to go and what to do. The linebackers may still be after you, but at least your purpose is clear!I'm on a drug study, so technically the \"Avonex\" I inject myself with weekly could be a placebo. *Or* the study drug they inject me with, sub-cutaneously every month at the hospital could be the placebo.A weekly inter-muscular injection was the first treatment I ever gave myself and I would have gone with Avonex even if the study hadn't come through. Thinking of something once a week and no more has huge appeal for me.Your training nurse may provide an Avoject (what I use, though that may be just a Europe thing) or the new Avonex pen. I trained doing it with nothing but the syringe, so it can definitely be done. In fact I did it that way for a few months until the Avoject came in.The delightful surprise was that it doesn't hurt! Avonex is the only IM injection, so it has the most 'hard core' looking needle, but I can tell you I far prefer it to that little thing they stick in my belly!Because I'm on a study, I'm not suppose to know what I'm on. They told me for the first six months to take acetaminophen per package instructions an hour before injecting and for the following 24 hours. This was to help combat any flu-like symptoms that might give the game away. I still don't know which drug I'm on, but I can report that I never felt any flu-like symptoms. If the thought of having those symptoms is a concern, perhaps mention to your nurse if she has any tips like that - something prophylactic.",

            "answer": "Darn, like others I was hoping the abnormal LP might not mean MS. I am sorry you have joined the club but relieved you know what you are fighting.I take Rebif which is the same as Avonex but 3 times a week instead of once and it is subcutaneous instead of in the muscle.Side effects are random for me. They gradually increased my dose over a month and the first full dose gave me really intense chills but other than that I can occasionally wake up with a mild fever or headache.I do not know yet how well it is working because I have only been taking it 5 months.They recommend taking a pain reliever (ibuprofen or acetaminophen) before the injection to help reduce the side effects and to do injections before bed so you sleep through most of them.They will monitor your liver with blood tests periodcially to make sure it isn't causing you any harm. If you can get an auto injector then I highly recommend it. Much easier to tolerate the shots that way and not so much work to get the shot ready.Remember that even though you were ready for answers and knew MS was possible that you will still have times when you feel shell shocked so be gentle with yourself. It is a lot to take in.I was only six months in limbo myself and jumped into the dx with both feet so after a few months everything started to feel overwhelming. So many changes to my life and the medication schedule... It is important to have support even counselling if you can.Best of luck with your journey,Corrie",

            "answer": "Glad you finally got a diagnosis. The hard thing about the first injection is makes the whole thing real. Its emotional and that is what makes it hard. I did Copaxone and had no trouble injecting every day.You will go all over the map the first year with your feelings. We call it the roller coaster. It takes a bit of getting used to having a chronic illness. I would wake up and think do I really have MS or is this a weird dream.Luckily you can get used to anything. The most important thing to remember is every symptom of MS will not happen to you. I read through the list and people told me things would happen to me. At the beginning I was waiting for the other shoes to drop. MS is unpredictable but you can't live your life like that. Also no to cases are the same.I have had MS for 48 years. I have never had ON and may never get it. I started riding horses after being diagnosed in 2009. I decided to do the things I always wanted to do and that was one of them.I realized I am the same person with MS as I was before the diagnosis. In my case I had MS from the age of two I just did not have a label.There will be hard times but they are doable. It is amazing what you can get through and still be happy.Alex",

            "answer": "Thanks everyone. I really appreciate all the comments. I have another question. Someone mentioned that I do not have typical symptoms. Is numbness, face pain, memory loss, lesions on the brain.. etc. typical. From what I have read it is typical.Also, why would an abnormal lumbar puncture make some think no MS... I am confused, when I have researched abnormal would be having the oligoclonal bandings, high protein, and everything else that shows abnormal. So just wondering why a couple said that abnormal spinal meant no ms. From the research that I have done for the past nine months, 90% of people with MS have a abnormal spinal.I appreciate the encouragement. I do not like needles, however, would rather get better than loose my memory. Thanks again.",

I work full time and don't have time to be sick.. sounds funny since that is what I am a lot, but I still work. I am thinking about trying it on Fridays, so I have Saturdays to recover... He also said I need to see my MD about my blood pressure, the bottom number was 144 so I guess that is high. It has been high lately, but I wrote it off to nerves.I am 33 and just might be falling apart :) I know God has this and will help me through.~B",

            "answer": "Other illnesses can cause abnormal LPs. When I had 12 obands in the CSF only and not the blood serum the next step was blood work to rule out other illnesses. The main one was Lupus. They did an ANA test for Lupus and it came out high which really means I have a lot of inflammation which fit with 12 0bands. They then did an anti DNA test for Lupus.I had no lupus symptoms only MS symptoms plus the abnormal MRIs pointing to MS. The anti DNA test came out Negative so Lupus was off the table. They also tested me for Neurophyllis and HIV even though that was unlikely. These are routine. When all these were ruled out I was finally diagnosed with MS. It took six weeks and was an anxious time for me.The thing is no test rules MS in or out they are all part of the puzzle. My first MRI showed classic MS lesions and 4 Neurologists said they thought I had MS from my MRI and Neurological Exam. I had five more abnormal MRIs and abnormal evoked potential tests and abnormal Neuro Opthomology tests but I was not diagnosed until the LP two years later. I was told by six Neurologists I would be diagnosed with MS at some point but none of them would diagnose it. I had my first Neurological hospitalization in 1965 when I was two years old. They now say that is when my MS started.Alex",

            "answer": "Absolutely as Alex said, we are here for you!Off the top of my head so bare with me, you had mentioned a lot of sx's more consistent with diabetes than for someone 'first' presenting with 'only' MS, you had been dx with diabetes and had had whooping cough too and the additional dx's, tends to add more sx's than what's typical for presenting MS.Honestly, before you mentioned your MRI with the specific location of one of the lesions (corpus collusm) I'd been going by what you'd said in your fatigue and pain post. The sx's you just mentioned in the fatigue and pain post, were not particularly specific or suggestive of MS. A lot of sx's in MS are common sx's associated with other conditions eg diabetes, Lupus, viral infections etc etcThey mimic sx's of MS and you'd already been recently dx with 2 potential mimics which made (from my perspective) the odds more likely what you'd been already dx with, than additionally having MS as well but as soon as you specified you had a CC lesion, that one piece of MRI evidence on its own put MS high on your list of possible causes of what was going on.I knew that definitely put MS on your list too and I had my fingers crossed that your LP wouldn't come up with more supportive evidence of MS, that makes 3 dx this year for you, which it totally and utterly unfair!I went through the more recent sx's you'd mentioned in some other posts, and there is a lot associated with both MS and diabetes.Fatigue - huge issueHead achesbilateral ankle painfeet hurtUTI's - urinary frequentcycognitive issues - memory, concentrationface painnumbness in limbsarm and leg go numbmuscle twitchesblurred visionbody hurtsI don't even know how to fathom a guess on which sx's will completely go, (never to return) because (yay well done!) you win the weight battle and no longer have type 2 diabetes OR which sx's were caused by the MS, so 'could' remit (partially or completely). I have no doubt that if you didn't have diabetes, everything would not be 'as hard' as it is now, both complicates what your dealing with and everything would be a much harder battle than if you were dealing with either condition alone.\u00a0\u00a0HUGS!Have a read of those MS health pages i listed because i think it might help to know some tips and understanding of fatigue, because you can 'not' push threw it, but you can limit its impact more, if you understand what its all about.HUGS.............JJPS Seriously you need some TLC and a few epic but gentle hugs!",
