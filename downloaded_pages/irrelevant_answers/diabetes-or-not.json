            "answer": "First off, congrats on stopping the beer guzzling and I'm glad you posted. Your glucose levels indicate you are pre-diabetic. If your fasting glucose level is 100 to 125 mg/dL, you have a form of pre-diabetes called impaired fasting glucose (IFG), meaning that you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes but do not have it yet. A level of 126 mg/dL or above means that you have diabetes. You can get this under control by carefully monitoring your nutrition along with doing moderate exercise. There is no cure for diabetes. Once you're a full blown diabetic you're one for life. Follow these links for more information on pre-diabetes prevention and control.http://www.diabetes.org/pre-diabetes.jsphttp://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/faq/prediabetes.htmDiabetes can also have an impact on your kidney's. Your other numbers indicate kidney issues are beginning. Drinking alcohol, even a few beers, will only irritate and degrade your kidney's further. You don't want to do that. Currently there are 99,507 people on the wait list for kidney transplant. The national average, I believe, is 15,000 transplant a year. How many people die waiting for a kidney? You do the math, the results are not pretty. Please take control of your lifestyle now before it's too late. Here is a link on kidney disease prevention that has 1,191,000 hits.\u00a0\u00a0http://tinyurl.com/6h5kdy",

    "question": "I was a heavy beer drinker for several years and finaly decided to quit. I went to the doctor to get blood and urine work done. Everything was good except for the followingglucose 102---range65 - 99 mg/dlcalcium serum 10.4---range 8.6 - 10.2 mg/dltotal protein 8.2---range6.2 - 8.3 g/dlalbumin5.2----range 3.6 - 5.1g/dlcreatine, serum 1.20---range.50 - 1.30 mg/dlI dont know what this means? Do I now have diabetes? The first few days after I quit drinking I felt great. Now It feels like my heart is thumping hard all the time, especially if I eat high glycemic foods like white bread or cookies. Even avoiding those only helps some though. Unfortunately my doctor is no help at all. He says my blood pressure is fine and that my sugar is only slightly high. I think it is probably different all the time, just not as bad in the morning when I take the fasting tests. please help? Thanx Steve",
