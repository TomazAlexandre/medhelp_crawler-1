            "answer": "Thanks for the quick response. I don't take any antibiotics, and my diet hasn't really changed in the past few months. The only true thing is that now that since I'm working in restaurants again, I'm not eating dinner until 10 or 11 at night. Could that cause any change? Thanks again.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The symptoms could be due to poor absorption as in irritable bowel syndromes and malabsorption syndromes. Malabsorption syndromes are seen in intestinal tuberculosis, HIV, tropical sprue, parasites in stool and Whipple\u2019s Disease. Diabetes and fungal infection too can be the cause. It can also be a liver problem.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Get your stool examined. Take care!",

    "question": "Hello all, hope all is well. I was hoping someone could help me figure out what is going on. First, a little background about me, I'm not certain if any of this is relevant or not. About 9 years ago, I was diagnosed as having epilepsy and my neurologist started me on Depakote. About 5 years ago, I had an appendectomy. Anyway, in the past couple of months, I have started to notice some white chunks in my stool. They are almost perfectly rectangular looking, and I assumed they were a foam of some sorts. Also, my stool has a semi-sweet smell to it (if that's possible). Finally, in the past couple of months I have gone from 205 to 180. I figured that was because I am working outside now and moving around quite a bit. If anyone could help me out, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you very much.",
