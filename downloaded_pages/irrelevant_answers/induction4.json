            "answer": "Yes it's fine. Your doc won't induce you unless they think Its best for you and baby. 37W is term so your pretty close! Also if there is a concern you doc will or would have talked to you about steroids to help make sure the babies lungs are developed enough. If the baby is under 5lbs the baby might have to stay in the nicu for a couple days. But viable wise you shouldn't have an issues at 36w unless there is an underlying health condition.",
