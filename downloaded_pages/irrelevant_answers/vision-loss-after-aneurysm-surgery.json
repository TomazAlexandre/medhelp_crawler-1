            "answer": "You probably had a bit of plaque dislodged which then blocked a blood vessel causing damage to the nerves of one eye secondary to ischemia. Your sugeon didn't mention this because \"malpractice tort\" showed up in front of his eyes in six foot neon letters while the sirens and gongs went off in the background. The statement \"I have no explanation\" is at best a fib. If he really believes this he should not be practicing medicine. In fairness this is often a complication of such an operation and negligence is not involved. There may be some negligence in post-op care, because they are suppossed to be checking for this complication repeatedly, and there is a window of opportunity for remedial action to be taken.",

    "question": "I experience the loss of vision in my right eye after aneurysm surgery on 12/07; the surgeon had no explanation of what happened and has requested me to see an neuro-ophthalmologist to get a better understanding or possibly to confirm what he already knows that the return of my sight is more likely not returning. I would like to note my vision was good before surgery and no known contributing factors such as high blood pressure or diabetes. Has anyone experience vision loss of this nature, if so what was your outcome?Thanks",
