            "answer": "I too have a mass on my liver and because dr cannot tell what it is, she is keeping me on chemo. Can fatty mass change in size? Can you share the names of the tests/machines used to determine that the mass was not cancer???Has anyone had radiofrequency ablation ? How long does it take to recover? Can it be done on an out-patient basis?",

            "answer": "I have a had a strange mass on my liver for a couple months now. It was first suspected to be mets, based on a CT scan. I had an ultra-sound done, and the tech couldn't see anything - it wasn't there! Then, just last week, I had an MRI done, and my liver does have a small defined area that is still suspicious for disease, although they are leaning much more towards fatty infiltration or some type of inflamation. It's very possible that it could be something other than disease, especially if your Mom has had previous chemo, as fatty infiltration can be a common side effect from the toxicity of chemo.Good luck,Becky",

            "answer": "Jeez, I posted a reply that was pretty long and it didn't post when I hit post comment.\u00a0\u00a0What I wanted to say was that fatty liver is actually a disease called fatty liver disease.\u00a0\u00a0It can be caused by alcohol, but usually it isn't.\u00a0\u00a0When it isn't it is called non alcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD for short.\u00a0\u00a0It is thought to be caused by insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0It is common in people who have excess weight, or who dont exercise regularily, or who dont eat too well, also heredity can lead some there.\u00a0\u00a0In a nut shell, we all know when sugar is eaten insulin is realeased, but when cells are intolerant to insulin, there is too much insulin and too much glucose floating around in the blood.\u00a0\u00a0It ends up being stored as fat in cells and also ends up in the liver as fat, henceforth fatty liver.\u00a0\u00a0It can be reversed by eating right, losing weight and exercising.\u00a0\u00a0This condition leads to diabetes and many with it allready have diabetes or are pre diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Becky mentioned something about chemo causing it too, I am sure many other things can cause it also.\u00a0\u00a0Kimchi, yes the fatty deposits can get bigger smaller etc.\u00a0\u00a0The test I had that found my fatty liver was a CT, they were not looking for liver problems but found it.\u00a0\u00a0I think that is actually how it is usually found by accident.\u00a0\u00a0I think sometimes they can tell it is fatty liver other times they arn't sure, depending on how it looks.\u00a0\u00a0They dont like to do liver biopsies because of potential bleeding problems and various other issues, though that is the only thing that will tell for sure.\u00a0\u00a0It really could be any of this I guess it is hard for them to tell, but try not to worry too much. Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Hugsss.. Shannon",
