            "answer": "None of your symptoms sounds like gonorrhea, HIV, or any other STD.\u00a0\u00a0Coated tongue is a very nonspecific symptom, i.e. it doesn't indicate a specific condition any more than does fever, headache, and that sort of thing.\u00a0\u00a0In any case, if 3 doctors can't find an explanation, I cannot help further.\u00a0\u00a0Almost certainly your symptoms have nothing to do with the sexual exposure you describe, unless they are the consequence of anxiety over the event.Continue to follow up with your doctors, or request referral for yet another opinion if you are not confident they are on top of the problem.\u00a0\u00a0But you can put HIV, hepatitis, and other STDs out of your mind.Good luck-- HHH, MD",

    "question": "33 year old male in relatively good health, moderate smoker, rarely drinks alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0I've been having some problems since around 2/9/06 that I will try to describe briefly.\u00a0\u00a0I've only had one sexual encounter in about 8 months, right around 2/7/06.\u00a0\u00a0I've had numerous symptoms since that time.\u00a0\u00a0I had protected sex with a condom but previously had performed brief oral sex on this woman.\u00a0\u00a0Starting 2/9/06 these symptoms have ocurred over 6-7 weeks time...tingling and dry lower lip, cheeks and throat seem irritated, some nausea, depression, anxiety, 2 days of testicles aching, poor ejaculation, blood vessels in eyes flared up, small reddish marks on face that look like blood vessels, urethra seems swollen, top of tongue is whitish in color.\u00a0\u00a0My tongue concerns me most, its like white/brown furry tongue (brown from coffee) that won't go away.\u00a0\u00a0I've been using a tongue scraper now but without using it, the fungus looking stuff will get really thick around my large Papillea/taste buds towards the back of my tongue.All symptoms have come and gone now except for the following...tongue bacteria or whatever, 2 to 3 red spots on face, urethra swollen off and on, lower half of lower lip is dry, note that I never really get chapped lips before.\u00a0\u00a0At least not for 7 weeks.Here's one catch that may rule some things out as well regarding my mouth...I've had no mouth/throat pain, swollen glands or nodes this whole time.I was tested for STD's late February and all were negative.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not confident with the test results, could this be throat Gonorrea?\u00a0\u00a0Whats frustrating is that I have seen 3 doctors and my dentist but none have diagnosed anything clinical.\u00a0\u00a0I know my health and I honestly think that there is something viral or bacterial going on.\u00a0\u00a0I've done many, many hours/days of research and this is all I can come up with based on my symptoms... Possible Diabetes(or blood related/disorder), Cancer, Candida, Trich, Gonorrea, HPV, HIV, or Hepatitis.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't studied up on Hepatitis too much yet.\u00a0\u00a0Alternate Diagnosis could be prostate problem related but I've never had a problem in the past.\u00a0\u00a0I'm just finding it hard to think that these symptoms are just coincidence with my sexual encounter.\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, my dentist did say I had the start of minor gum disease and my (4) molars should be removed.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't seem like this should cause all of these symptoms though. Right now I'm planning to get tested and get bloodwork done in early May unless there are new symptoms or something changes more severe.",
