            "answer": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0As a fasting blood glucose result, 80 is on the low end of the ok range, but it is in the ok range.If your daughter will develop diabetes, or just hypoglycemia, there is nothing known that you can do to prevent it.\u00a0\u00a0You can keep your family, daughter included, more healthy through exercise and a better diet with more fruits and grains, for example, but that won't stop hypoglycemia in your daughter.\u00a0\u00a0That being said, you may want to verify with your doctor on what range your doctor was basing the diagnosis on, because an 80 score doesn't seem to be in the range.\u00a0\u00a0Just remember that I'm not a medical professional, though, just a parent like you.",

            "answer": "It's absolutely something to be concerned about, but if your daughter doesn't show any more symptoms it likely isn't as big of concern.\u00a0\u00a0Just learn the symptoms and keep a watch out, and ensure that the hypoglycemia doesn't progress.",

    "question": "My daughter was diagnosed yesterday by her doctor with hypoglycemia and her blood sugar was 80.\u00a0\u00a0I am not finding much about this on the internet but what I have found does not say this is a bad level.\u00a0\u00a0This was at about 11 am in the morning with nothing to eat of drink since night before.\u00a0\u00a0Should I be doing anything but helping her with diet and excercise and does this seem to be in the hypo range to you?",
