            "answer": "I'm copying a related post answered by Dr Ramsetty from March 2008.\"Were you able to check your blood sugars during that times you felt the nausea? That is the only way to know if it is related to the blood sugar levels.Nausea is a common side effect of some medications used for diabetes, however it is also associated with diabetes itself, and also other problems such as reflux and heart disease. If the nausea continues and does not seem to be related to either high or low blood sugars, speak to your doctor about this being a possible side effect AND start searching for other causes.In regard to the eating, perhaps a consultation with a diabetes nutritionist will help\u00a0\u00a0in getting you on the right path. It does take some willpower, but you can definitely teach yourself some healthier habits.\"Its really hard to answer you question directly since your kept the following a secret:1. Diabetes medication(s) you're taking2. Whether you home test - prandial and postprandial3. Your nutrition4. Your weight5. Any exercise6. Last time you saw a doctor7. Had an A1c testPerhaps if you can fill us in with more information others can come along and post their thoughts.",

Mixing drugs can be potentially dangerous.\"2- don't know what you mean with #2\"If you're diabetic you need to obtain a home test kit - glucose meter, test strips, and lancets - and test, test, test until you know how to control your glucose levels. Prandial means before a meal, postprandial 2-4 hours after a meal.
