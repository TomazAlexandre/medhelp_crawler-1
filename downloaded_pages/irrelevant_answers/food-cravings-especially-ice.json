Every month I have blood work because my potassium goes so low.I found out why I wanted to crunch ice all the time and it's not very exciting. I had dry mouth from the fentanyl patches, xanax, and amiltriptyline. I'm just happy I have an automatic ice maker. lolHave a great day, my friends.LS",

            "answer": "I'm worried about my teeth because of crunching ice. When I start crunching I know it's time to increase my iron. If I tell my Dr this he will roll his eyes. In 2005 my hemoglobin was 8 and I started taking 975mg of ferrous sulfate and 1500 mg of Vit C daily. Now I am on 325 and 500 respectively but increase it if I start craving ice. Before I started taking iron I would wake up in the middle of the night and eat glasses full of crushed ice. I can maintain low normal hemo but my ferritin, stored iron, always stays below normal. I am checked two to three times a year but the ice eating is my best indicator of my anemia. It's comforting to know that others share my conclusions. Thanks for sharing.Judy",

            "answer": "I am not going thru any withdrawls but I do have a very bad habit with ice crunching. Like someone else said, it's so bad I even get up in the middle of the night to get some. I knew it was cause by some deficiency but I couldn't remember what so I went searching and found this site. I do have the dry mouth, I get B-12 injections every 4 wks because I was borderline anemic for so long. I don't know if it's one of these things or something else, maybe the potassium someone mentioned. I guess I will start some vitamins and see if that helps. I feel I need to do something because I know it's not good for my teeth and I've been doing it for a long time. I haven't mentioned it to my dr because I'd feel like a dummy doing that. I think I'll try the vitamins first and see how it goes.",

It is a sign of iron deficincy anemia, and I have been anemic since I was in my teens (I'm 28 now) and I just recently started to retake my take iron supplements. But I wonder also, if because I drastically quit smoking the past 2 months as well, if I may be trading one addiction for another. It's really weird how this all came about, but I hope it's just a phase and will end soon.",

    "question": "I'm posting this up here.. because the thread is all the way down there.. hoping that it will be read sooner than later.To experience \"cravings\" is simply your body asking for a nutrient the food of crave has in it...i.e. eggs.. could be you really need the protein.. I'm not so sure what else it could be in the eggs.\u00a0\u00a0 I'd have to look it upThree weeks ago... I craved BARLEY.. I don't even like barley but I couldn't stop eating it... Here... Barley is a \"calmative\" and it's loaded w/protein...(Long story here, I'll spare you all the middle of the story)\u00a0\u00a0go figure (those of you who know my story know about the anxiety I was having) I actually never even thought to post about craving BARLEY...thought you guys would think I was nutzo.BUT about the ice crunching... It could mean anemia... take a daily Vit B-12 sublingal.. they are cheap...But cravings for ice is def. triggered by signs of early anemia... which is also normal for those going through W/D ... doesn't even have to be drugs....could be from anything....Amino Acids, lethicin, b-complex, multi-vits, protein supplements all really do help with the W/D thing.Just wanted to stress to you all about the ice thing...Gip",
