    "question": "I feel deep painful bruising when touched/scratching on my back & arms but see no bruises. What are the POSSIBILITY(ies)? I also have white pen tip size pigmentations all over my body. I have palpatations/mitral valve prolapse-only Med is Atenolol. I have osteoporosis. Was taking Fosamax but had trouble with my stomach \"area\" & had to stop. I have enlarged deformed pelvic kidney w/cyst & occas. blood in the urine, new find-fatty borderline enlarged liver. Urologist can't do anything-kidney partially functioning. He didn't tell me about enlarged liver, but I read the radiology rpt. I researched & the causes being alcoholism or diabetes-I don't drink alcohol and do not have diabetes(?) I am not getting any results with the local doctors. Can Atenolol cause liver damage or Fosamax, Tylenol, Advil? Is it reversible?\u00a0\u00a0Are liver spots only brown or can they be white? If not what are white spots from? Because of sudden & again undiagnosed muscular or arthritis & sometimes disabling pain in my feet, and the kidney troubles, my many hours of researching this keeps bringing me to Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis/Nephrogenic Fibrosing Dermopathy. I have had so many MRI's & CTS with & without the contrast. Could the skin patches from NFS/NFD be white like this rather than dark as I see described? I have spent so much $ seeing drs for all my health issues but am disturbed-I'm sick, now $ broke with no answers. I have just about had it with it all and just so ready to just throw in the towel.",
