Diabetes and B 12 deficiency are two common causes of peripheral neuropathy.In your case fibromyalgia can also be a cause of nerve pain.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FibromyalgiaPlease discuss this with your doctor and make sure you do regular physical exercise and sleep for at least 8 hrs in the night. Take care!",

    "question": "About 2 weeks ago I was sitting ina\u00a0\u00a0chair and without any real explaination I suffered a couple second attack of nerve pain. It is a sharp electric feeling one who has had any kind of diagnosed nerve pain knows all too well.I do have diagnosed Fibromyalgia... but never experienced anything liek this. Usually the pain is duller and not so electric. Dr's seem to agree I have some sort of undiagnosed auto-immune,... but none have done much serious looking into it.Pressure on the joint, standing too long, sitting too long aggrivates it. Hot and cold aggrivate it. But nothign was done to injure it, even a day or two before. Sometimes i think its' getting better sometimes worse. For awhile attacks got worse, then they got less and less and then more.. and now less, but the pain is getting more severe. The attacks last 10 seconds to a full 2 minutes. It's a gripping pain. Tried using a crutch on that side and walking on ti with just pulling some body weight off, whihc helped in amount of attacks, but not severity... and then today on ti full force again.. no more then I was having ont he crutch, but pain still worse.I can't get to a doctor right now.I am curiosu to see what it is.. I have looked up Gout, pseudogout, bursitis, etc etc etc... nothign seems to fit. Any ideas?Anyone have something similar? Have suggestions for dealign with the pain.",
