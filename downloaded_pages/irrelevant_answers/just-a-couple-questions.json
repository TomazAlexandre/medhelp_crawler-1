She doesn't want the baby to get too big he is only measuring a week ahead but within a week they can grow a bit more especially since my body isn't beaking down the sugars properly so all the additional sugars go to the baby and causes them to get a bit bigger.",

    "question": "I had my 38 week check up today she checked me and I am only a fingertip dialated and still pretty thick is what she said. How can I get my cervix to soften up? I have sex with my boyfriend daily, I was walking, I have bounced on the edge pf our bed since I don't have an exercise ball. The Dr told me that if I don't have him by my due date the 23 that she is going to bring me into the hospital for taping? What is that? Then the next day she is going to start pitosin. With all that being said how can I soften my cervix and what is taping?",
