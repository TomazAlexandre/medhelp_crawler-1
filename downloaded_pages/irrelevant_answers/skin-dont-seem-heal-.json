    "question": "i had a sun burn five years ago, and began developing small imperceptibe bumps in the area where the sun burn were the worst. Then when my skin was still tender from the sun burn, I was bitten by a bug and it developed into an abcess. That was tended to and is OK. However, now where the abcess had been, it is kind of bumpy and skin is still broken there (area of 0.5 inch about the size of the old abscess). Also i was bitten by an ant on my foot 2 years ago, and it is also the same. It did not get to be abcessed, but where the bite had been, it also looks bumpy and skin is still scabbing out all the time (0.8 inches). I never used to have these types of problem. It doesn't hurt and don't itch aside from looking unsightly. Also it is not growing. Why does my skin tend to do that? What do you call this and what do I need to take to prevent more bumps like that. I take vitamin E regularly, but does not seem to do a thing. What to do to fix it?",
