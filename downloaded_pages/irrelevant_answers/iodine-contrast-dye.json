            "answer": "It could be a problem. I found this:http://imaginis.com/ct-scan/contrast.asp\"Patients should inform the radiologist or technologist if they have a history of allergies (especially to medications, previous iodine injections, or shellfish), diabetes, asthma, a heart condition, kidney problems, or thyroid conditions. These conditions may indicate a higher risk of iodine reactions or problems with eliminating the iodine after the exam.\"http://thyroid.about.com/od/thyroidbasicsthyroid101/a/riskfactors.htm\"Having a medical test in which an iodine-based contrast agent is used slightly increases the risk of developing a temporary thyroiditis, hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. (Note: Those with underlying thyroid antibodies and a tendency toward autoimmunity appear to be at more risk)\"And here is a link to a thread on MedHelp about the issue:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/17462Be careful.",

            "answer": "I am Hypo also. I had normal labs for awhile too, possibly because of other health problems I had. I had to have alot of test and a few that had contrast and even one that was nuclear. My doctor is wonderful and really knows what he is doing, his comment to me about the risks of the contrast, and nuclear are the results of tests are more informative than the risk or danger of the contrast to your health.",

            "answer": "thanks for all the comments. I can see that there is maybe small risks for most people but for a small minority it can be disasterous. I am worried because i just seem to be so sensitive to any change in my thyroid hormones, however small. I hope that if i do need this scan then they can do it without the dye or use one that isn't iodine based!",

    "question": "I am hypothyroid and now have normal thyroid function test results. However, it has taken a long time to get to this stage and i am very sensitive to small changes in my thryroid hormone levels. I am also not completely symptom free. Next month, i may be having a scan of the kidneys that uses iodine contrast dye. Could this be risky? I have tried looking for information on the internet but can't get a definitive answer.",
