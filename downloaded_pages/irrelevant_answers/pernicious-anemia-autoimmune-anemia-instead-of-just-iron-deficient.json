            "answer": "Vitamin B12 deficiency can be seen with:* Decreased vitamin B12 serum - serum reference range is far too low in most countries however. Japan and Europe increased the lowest acceptable B12 serum to 500 or 550pg/mL.* Elevated methylmalonic acid (MMA) - methylmalonic acid rises just 10 days after a B12 deficiency starts. MMA is a sensitive and early indicator of vitamin B12 deficiency. Urinary MMA more accurate than a blood MMA test.Elevated homocysteine.Elevated holotranscobalamin.After confirming a B12 deficiency, testing for parietal cell antibody and intrinsic factor antibody is recommended based on your risk factors**.Iron deficiency is very common with celiac's disease. Research reported in the medical journal \"Digestive Diseases and Sciences\", a significant number of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease have celiac disease.\u00a0\u00a0Some people with celiac disease have no symptoms.**Risk factors for autoimmune pernicious anaemia include:* Your risk increases with age:- 1 in 1 000 people (1000 in 1 million) over the age of 60 develop pernicious anaemia- 1 in 10 000 people (100 in 1 million) under the age of 40 develop pernicious anaemia* Female* Family history of the disease - 3 out of every 10 people who have autoimmune pernicious anaemia, someone else in their family also has the condition* History of autoimmune endocrine disorders, including: Addison's disease, Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, Graves disease, Hypoparathyroidism, Hypopituitarism, Myasthenia gravis, Type 1 diabetes, Vitiligo* Blood type A* Blue eyes* Scandinavian or Northern European descent",

My symptoms return within 3 days if i don't take my sublingual B12 spray!I read your other question \"lupus or connective tissue disease\".\u00a0\u00a0I had lupus like red rash on my face that lasted for an hour or so but only after a shower. A random symptom that i have had for over 4 years with no explanation. Another symptom was splinter haemorrages on my nails that came and went again with no explanation.It was only when these two symptoms worsened dramatically during a two month hashitoxicosis flare up (i too have Hashimoto's thyroiditis) and i realised these were both a symptoms of a hyperthyroid flare up (extremely mild to moderate/severe).The following excerpt is from the book \"The Everything Guide To Thyroid Disease\" by Theodore C. Friedman, MD, PhD and Winnie Yu Scherer...\"Although the majority of people with Hashimoto's will not develop any other disorders, it's important to know what some of these autoimmune conditions are in case you do start to experience symptoms. Keep in mind, too, that you may be more likely to develop Hashimoto's if you have one of these other conditions.Type 1 diabetesPernicious AnaemiaAddison's DiseaseVitiligoCeliac DiseaseAlopecia AretaSystematic Lupus Erthematosus (SLE)Rheumatoid ArthritisSjogren's SyndromeInflammatory Bowel DiseaseMultiple Sclerosis (MS)\"",
