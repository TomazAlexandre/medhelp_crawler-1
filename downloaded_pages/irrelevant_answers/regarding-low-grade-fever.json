    "question": "For the past seven years I have had a low-grade fever (from 99 to 100 degrees), accompanied by a severe exhaustion. This condition starts in the late morning and continues to around 4:00 or 5:00 pm. During this seven year period this is a daily occurrence in every summer and also sometimes in winter also.I have seen nine doctors in the last times . All tests done by them proved negative.At times I've seriously thought that I am losing my mind -- though I can see the evidence of the fever in my trusty thermometer. My quality of life right now hovers just over zero -- , and my wonderful husband has suffered tremendously as I go through this.A few additional notes -- I'm 41 years old, in very good health (except for this).\u00a0\u00a0I am diabetic from Jan 2007. Due to fever I cann't do any exercise and walk because due to fever my body does not work properly. I have taken all the strong antibiotics (allopathic/ayurvedic) and necessary test but nothing is found there in./I'm truly grateful to have found this MedHelp site -- and I'll be happy to share any and all thoughts or experiences that might help someone else.Thanks.RegardsHarjit Kaur",
