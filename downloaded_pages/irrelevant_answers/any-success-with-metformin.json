            "answer": "I was diagnosed with PCOS last month, but honestly I knew something was wrong for some years. Mine i could say is a little different, I don't have any cysts on my ovaries and never missed a period, in fact mine are always very heavy and it always comes every month. I have always been a larger women, even as a child. My Doc put me on Metformin 500mg. Everyone is different with side affects I had a upset stomach the first week, I add a mulit-vitman with it and it really helped the upset. Nearly every website you find about PCOS it talks about diet and exercise, it does work i've losted weight by\u00a0\u00a0eating three balance meals a day with walking. I feel better, having a positive outlook on it,\u00a0\u00a0has helped me deal with PCOS. PCOS can make you depressed, ive been there(crying thinking I won't be able to have children) but everyone is different to med's. My best advise is find a good physician that you like and feel comfortable around. Dont let a doctor tell\u00a0\u00a0you to be on BC when your TTC, its ********, try the metformin and if fails go to the next step.keep your heads up and keep trying.everything happens for a reason. :)",
