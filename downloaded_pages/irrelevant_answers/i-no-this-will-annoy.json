            "answer": "Yeah I totally understand. Personally after knowing the struggles of having a premature child the best thing to do is wait at least till 36 weeks. Forget all the judgement. Ultimately you want your child coming home with you and if you can avoid the baby being under weight and/or with digestion issues the better it will be for you and baby.",

            "answer": "I think a lot of the women that take issue with wanting to have baby early are the ones that had to be induced early or went into premature labor and would have done anything to keep that baby inside longer. My doc induced me at 35 weeks for low fluid and I felt like such a failure. He was in the nicu for a month. The first 3 weeks he was struggling to breath for under developed lungs and the next week he was treated for pneumonia he picked up in hospital. I didn't get to breastfeed like I wanted because his oxygen would drop every time we tried. I cried every single night that I had to leave him and I'd sit in the nursery that we made for him and rock and think I'm supposed to be rocking my baby right now and he's in a hospital surrounded by machines. It's so odd to carry your baby for that long and then not get to see him whenever you want or hold him right away.\u00a0\u00a0Now I'm pregnant with twins and they say I'm probably going to have them early. I'm so sad and I know I will be more prepared this time but I just wanted a normal go to 40 weeks. :( so I can see how some women might get irritated that you can go all the way and we can't or didnt. But I also see how you can be so miserable that you can't even function! I get both sides.",

I was put on P17 shots with this pregnancy along with Lovenox for both pregnancy I'm so tired of getting stabbed by needles.. Not even counting how many times they do blood work and u go into l&d to get checked... O go for a growth ultrasound in 3 weeks and depending on how everything looks I'm gonna ask to b induced at 34 once babies receives steroid shots for his lungs with my pregnancy I have my heart problem\u00a0\u00a0to watch also and they want it to b assisted delivery and induction because I'm 2\u00bd hrs away from my high risk drs..
