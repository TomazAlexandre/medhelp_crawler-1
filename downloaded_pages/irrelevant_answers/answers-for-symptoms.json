            "answer": "I am surprised that you have seen 3 doctors and they have done nothing for you.You do need to go back to the doctor for a full examination and investigation.\u00a0\u00a0With you saying that the whites of your eyes are almost brown and yellow in colour indicates that you have jaundice which is a liver problem.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor should take blood tests to check for liver and kidney function, as well as anaemia.\u00a0\u00a0Having a swollen and sore tongue can be a sign of anaemia.\u00a0\u00a0And you may require iron supplements.\u00a0\u00a0Having hazy vision can be a sign of diabetes when the sugar levels in the blood are too high.If you drink alcohol, this has to stop.\u00a0\u00a0Alcohol damages the liver as well as killing off brain cells.\u00a0\u00a0Drink more water and diluted fruit juices, but keep off the orange juice in case this is triggering off your migraines.Excessive weight gain as well as eating too many calories than your body requires, can be from some illnesses like diabetes and hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).You may also have a fungal problem if your nipples are not healing.\u00a0\u00a0Did you not get anything from any of the doctors for this?\u00a0\u00a0Skin problems can be another sign of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If you were not prescribed anything for the chapped nipple, you can apply Sudocrem which you can buy from the pharmacy or big supermarkets, if that does not help, then you will need to look at getting an antifungal cream like canesten.\u00a0\u00a0The pharmacist may be able to assist you with this.Migraine headaches can be triggered off by certain foods, chocolate, coffee, oranges, red wine, cheese.\u00a0\u00a0So avoid these foods and keep a diary to find out if there are any other foods that may be triggering off your migraines.You really need to be examined by the medical profession urgently.\u00a0\u00a0You have too many things not right.If you are too unwell to make an appointment, ask for a home visit.I do not know what the procedure is about admitting yourself to A&E, but referral to a specialist is usually through a doctor.",
