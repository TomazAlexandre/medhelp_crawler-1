    "question": "my husband has diabetes and also I think he has rhumatoid arthritis in his fingers becuase they hurt him alot and they are swelling and the top joint. the other day he was working outside fixing a fence around our yard when the nail gun he was using shot thru the wood and punctured one of his fingers! It unfortunately was one that is very swollen already at the tip joint (I believe from arthritis). He came in to tell me and he was in alot of pain in his wrist and at the shoulder of that arm, but he said the tip of the finger was just numb. I cleaned the puncture area with hydrogen peroxide and told him we better get him to a doctor, that he might need a tetnes shot and better wound care, he refused to go! I think for one he hates going to the doctor and two he has no medical insurance right now... Im very worried it's been a couple of days since the puncture wound and his finger hurts him alot and looks like it's getting swollen, also maybe turning a little blue! I have some anti-biotics that I only took one day for a urinary tract infection I thought I had, but didn't, should I start him on those, it's a full bottle, there called; (generic)\u00a0\u00a0Bactrim DS. I know this is stupid and he should just go to the doctor but I can't make him go, we are going thru a hard time right now, both of us are unemployed, so thats probably one reason he doesn't want to go, but if this gets worse I believe he will eventually give in, I just hope it's not to late! He is only 40 years old and hopfully has alot of years ahead of him if he takes care of himself. Please let me know what you think, could he lose his finger? If so I can probably convince him to go to the doctor. We have two sons and they love there dad very much and would be devistated if anything happened to him.thanks",
