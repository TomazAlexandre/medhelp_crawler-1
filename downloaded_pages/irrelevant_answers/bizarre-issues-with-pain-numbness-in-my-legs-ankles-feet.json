            "answer": "As I have not personally examined you nor have I reviewed your clinical history in detail, it is extremely difficult to give an accurate medical opinion that is specific to your particular case.\u00a0\u00a0Having said that, the symptoms are a bit concerning for an acute peripheral neuropathy (problem with the nerves going to your limbs), especially if the numbness is continuing to ascend above your ankles and up to your hands. Consider getting in to a neurologist or primary care doc to have it looked at just to make sure everything is ok. Unless you lay down or sat down on a hard surface in the lotus position for a prolonged period of time, have some kind of tumor in your pelvis, have had hip surgery, or had gunshot wounds or injections in the buttocks it would be unlikely that this is a primary sciatic nerve problem.\u00a0\u00a0THe more common use of the word sciatica usually refers to the back pain that radiates down the leg when nerve roots are compressed by things like a bad disc.\u00a0\u00a0But again, you would have to have pretty bad back disease to catch nerves coming out from both sides of the spinal cord.\u00a0\u00a0As for now, keep your feet warm and be careful where you step especially if it's numb. Good luck.",

    "question": "Hello all,I am a 25 year old, healthy male living that just relocated from Nebraska to Massachusetts.\u00a0\u00a0I have been here for two weeks and for the last six or seven days have had the following problems:It started with severe pain in the area behind my knees and my hamstring.\u00a0\u00a0It felt as if my muscles were constantly strained (like the muscles were being stretched).\u00a0\u00a0The pain was so extreme that I was not able to sleep at night... by the third day of this, I learned that I could temporarily ease the pain by stretching these muscles (by standing up and bending over trying to touch my toes).\u00a0\u00a0I am usually flexible enough to touch my toes in this manner with no problems but with this condition, I was struggling to get within 6 inches of them.Now that pain has gone away and now from my calves to my toes, there is a permanent sensation (as if I had sat on my legs and cut off the circulation), especially in my feet.\u00a0\u00a0Also, my feet are numb and feel very cold compared to rest of my body.I have chalked these problems up to stress and/or my change in climate (it has been around zero degrees all week in MA), but I am starting to wonder if I should consult a physician before this gets any worse.Anyone else had this happen?\u00a0\u00a0Any advice???",
