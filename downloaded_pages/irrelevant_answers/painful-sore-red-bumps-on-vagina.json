            "answer": "If I had anything like that, BESIDES finding a HOMEOPATHIC doctor (NOT a traditional, western medicine doctor -- they only treat SYMPTOMS; they don't CURE the ROOT of the symptoms), I would drink orange juice with cayenne pepper to wash my system out. I would eat echinacea to put my system in overdrive, ingest coconut oil to BURN the viruses (if there are any) and bacteria (that is what coconut oil does) and start eating raw food diet in order to strengthen my bodily terrain's ability to fight off what ever is causing this.Just strengthening the bodily terrain through raw food diet cures MANY so-called \"incurable\" diseases (like diabetes, for instance).Especially important to read (even if you just sit down at a \"Barnes & Nobles\" to read it, instead of buying it -- or call your local library to see if they carry these books) read \"Rainbow Green Live Food Cuisine\" by Dr. Gabriel Cousens, and \"Green For Life\" by Victoria Boutenko.Also, I would ask God to help me be cured and live as He sees is correct for my own good, and so that I could experience knowing Him.",

            "answer": "Hello,It can be infected hair follicles, boils or herpes sores. Since you are sexually active, it is better to rule out herpes as well. The only way of ruling it out is by getting yourself tested for genital herpes. Laboratory tests include: culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to test for presence of viral DNA. I sincerely advise you to consult a dermatologist and get it ruled out.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Okay. I feel awkward posting this but I am worried. I am only 16 and have these sore red bumps on my vagina... nowhere near the lips or anything though. It happened a few months ago and went away in about a month of having it. I JUST started having sex and they came back again. 3 weeks later. I've neverhad unprotected sex. I read somewhere that it might be the hair folicals? They do hurt a ton when I touch them. I don't believe it's herpes though. I'm still worried though. Any thoughts? I'd really appriciate it, thanks.",
