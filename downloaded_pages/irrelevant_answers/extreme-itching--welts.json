            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin can be due to various causes.In your case,I think it is due to hives. Hives (medically known as urticaria) are red, itchy, raised areas of skin that appear in varying shapes and sizes. They have a tendency to change size rapidly and to move around, disappearing in one place and reappearing in other places, often in a matter of hours.Many cases of hives are \"idiopathic,\" meaning no cause is known. Others may be triggered by viral infections or medications.The mainstay of treatment of hives is antihistamine which may be necessary for prolonged periods (in excess of 6 weeks). You can take non-sedating antihistamines such as Cetirizine(zyrtec) or Loratadine(Claritin) to get symptom relief. Sedating antihistamines such as Chlorphenamine(benadryl) is used at night to get urticaria control. Short courses of oral cortisone or steroids are taken for short periods (one to three days) to settle more severe symptoms.You may take Vitamin C along with the prescribed treatment. Vitamin C is a general anti-allergy supplement. It helps stabilize mast cells so they are less likely to release histamine.Application of calamine lotion or mild steroids will also provide relief.If the symptoms persist then other possibilities like dermatitis,lice,scabies internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods have to be ruled out.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.",

    "question": "Twice in the past 24 hours, about 12 hours apart, I have experienced extreme itching on my torso, with some extensions on my arms and legs.\u00a0\u00a0After scratching madly, I noticed welts of various sizes appearing and the whole area becoming red.Bathing in the Aveeno Oatmeal Colloidal mixture seemed to soothe the itching, and gradually, over a period of 45 minutes to an hour, the redness and welts went away.Both times, the itching appeared right after I was napping or sleeping, and was worse on the side I was lying on.",
