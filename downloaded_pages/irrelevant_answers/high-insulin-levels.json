Among its many jobs, insulin signals the body to take in food (it has been called the \"hunger hormone\") and, once the food is consumed, signals the body to store the food energy in the form of fat.\"Full read herehttp://www.carbohydrateaddicts.com/cadfnd.htmlAnother read on high insulinhttp://www.drmirkin.com/diabetes/8113.htmFor now, I would not take Metformin. Metformin is used to treat Type 2 Diabetes and helps to produce insulin in the gut, the last thing you need.Good luck in finding a new doc that will listen to you. The last one sounds like a quack.",

    "question": "I am a single 30 y/o female.\u00a0\u00a0My sister was recently diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease and I have struggled with my weight since I was younger and wanted to have both things tested.\u00a0\u00a0I am heavy-set with a BMI of 20% however my cholesterol levels are normal and my blood pressure is 120/70.\u00a0\u00a0I am extremely active (baseball/hockey/tennis/running) and exercise daily.\u00a0\u00a0I am most definitely not a late night or throughout the day snacker and I also am very cautious about what I eat and do not eat sugary foods (soda, candy, bakery items) and try to avoid pasta and bread (bagels, etc.) as often as possible.\u00a0\u00a0My only terrible habit is that most days I tend to go the entire day without eating - only eating a sensible and appropriate dinner when I get home from work.\u00a0\u00a0(I was always under the assumption that a person should eat only when they feel hungry)My doctor performed several blood tests and advised that the tests showed that my \"fasting\" blood test showed I had very high insulin levels.\u00a0\u00a0She has prescribed Metformin for me; however, I have been trying to find out exactly what this means to no avail.\u00a0\u00a0She has confirmed that I do not have diabetes but hasn't / can't give me a name for what it is I do have.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to know what this means as far as a diagnosis is concerned so that I can educate myself a little more and determine what lifestyle changes I have to make in order to deal with this illness.\u00a0\u00a0I have recently been forcing myself to eat several small sensible meals/snacks throughout the day to try and maintain a steady blood sugar level but don't even know if this is the right thing to do or not either.\u00a0\u00a0When I attempted to make an appointment with my current doctor to discuss this matter in more detail, she scheduled one six weeks from now so needless to say I am searching for a new doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I would like to be able to explain a little more about my condition to my new doctor however, which is why I would like someone's help in explaining what this condition is called and what exactly this all means.",
