    "question": "ok basically I'm a 21 year old guy who untill this morning was perfectly normal in the southern areas.First off let me say I am a type 1 diabetic with Hb1AC of 7.9 at last check but its always been under 8 - a tad high i know but I'm generally well controlled and have no neuropathy anywhere or loss of sensation etc.Ok so this morning i was sitting on a chair for aaaaaaages with my legs bunched up tight and when i came off the chair i noticed my back was giving me jip about L1 level. i thought nothing of it and I had simply over worked it - fair enough but i noticed after that when i went to the loo that the entire left side of the shaft of my penis was numb - pretty much split down the middle. I have also lost surface sensation on the skin above the area effected and also a little surface sensation on the left side of my scrotum. i note that although surface sensation is pretty much gone i still have deep pressure sensation and there is no discolouration pain or dy skin etc - everything is normal except i cant feel much at all there. After some extensive investigation of my groinal area i can conclude that this continues as far as i can feel down the shaft untill it goes into the pelvic cavity. Everything works - i can pee pretty much on command as normal and no pain etc, and also erection and stimulation is not a problem - also strangely i retail my hot cold sensation to some degree :SI also note that I have had an operation to remove a twisted and inflamed cyst from my left testicle which was then attached to the scrotum wall, but it has never given me problems for about 11 years now.As i said my diabetes is well controlled but I found a few posts saying that pinching a nerve at L1 level can cause sensory loss in ur genital region.Apart from going to my doctor can anyone give me advice as I am due to move to canada in like 3 days. I plan to at least chat with my doctor but any advice here would also be great :DThanks guys!",
