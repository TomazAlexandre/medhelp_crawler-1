            "answer": "Stella, thanks for reply.\u00a0\u00a0I went because I really am extremely fatiqued and often thirsty and definitely foggy brained.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes was ruled out.\u00a0\u00a0Many sumptoms of hypothyroid are present but not all.\u00a0\u00a0For example, I never \"feel cold\".\u00a0\u00a0He's doing more tests so I will know more soon.\u00a0\u00a0I'm wondering about the possibility of adrenal fatique which would make the most sense to me given the amount and length of stress I've been under for the past year.\u00a0\u00a0I'ver seen a few postings about adrenal fatigue in this forum, and read that in the presence of taking Armour thyroid or maybe any thyroid supplement, that the symptoms of adrenal fatique can become worse.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe this can explain why I feel\u00a0\u00a0even less well on the armour?\u00a0\u00a0Was also told that 30 mg daily is a very small amount.I don't want to take a thyroid medication if it's not really needed.\u00a0\u00a0I would rather build myself up with good nutrition and supplements and exercise like swimming and yoga.\u00a0\u00a0This doctor is wholistic and from a very well respected practice.\u00a0\u00a0He'll be\u00a0\u00a0helping with this too but I need to trust that he's right on giving me the armour or move on to another doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I have a friend who takes Ioderal and has had good results.\u00a0\u00a0I asked about this but he said it would not do it for me.Why do you say the lab results are fine?\u00a0\u00a0They appear low to me although not off the bottom of the range. What do others reading this think?\u00a0\u00a0I was scanning through the forum looking for posting that included lab results for some others here.I've been taking the 30mg Armour for a little over a week now but am not going to take it today to see if I feel \"better\" - meaning back to my usual fatiqued self - rather than this even more fatiqued and sick feeling!\u00a0\u00a0I hope others will respond to all of this too.Thanks again,LauraLaura",

    "question": "Hello - am new here.\u00a0\u00a0I just started taking 30 mg of armour thyroid and actually feel worse.\u00a0\u00a0Friends tell me I look tired and not well, and that is how I feel.\u00a0\u00a0More tired and drained than before.\u00a0\u00a0My lab tests beofre armour thyroid were.... (t4) free 0.92 (limit 0.61-1.76),,,,,TSH 0.673 (limit 0.350-5.500)....T3 2.9 (limit 2.3-4.2).\u00a0\u00a0 Also, the DHEA was high ..... 162 (limit 13-130).\u00a0\u00a0I was also prescribed 5mg of DHEA daily which is confusing because the test indicates high if I'm reading it correctly, but dr says it's low. I'm going to question him about this before starting to add the DHEA.I'm an active 61 yr old and have been through a very unrelentlessly stressful period in past 6 months.Laura",
