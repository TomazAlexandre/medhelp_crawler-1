            "answer": "As you know, this may be due to a palsy of one of the cranial nerves due to chronically high glucose levels. It can also be due to infection. Or even an aneurysm. The condition is called apraxia and there are other complex reasons that mean you need a neurological work-up. Probably both an MRI and an MRA are in order. In any event, a look-sea by an M.D. neurologist, ideally someone specializing in this disorder would be desireable.",

            "answer": "Hope I'm not posting this twice. That is frightening. I have a neuro opthamologist and I guess I had better call him. I thought this was a more benign condition and I thank you for your comment and wake-up call.\u00a0\u00a0Somewhere on this site there were other people with these symptoms who thought it wasn't very serious. I think they ended their discussion last year but I don't know Joe to get to them. I hope they, too, called a doctor. Thank you again",

    "question": "My left eyelid has not been opening in the morning just as I wake up.\u00a0\u00a0I actually have to pull it open a couple of times and then when I'm totally awake it stays open.\u00a0\u00a0This has been going on for about two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I do have dry eye syndrome brought on by lasik surgery that didn't work well at all.\u00a0\u00a0I have punctual plugs in both eyes, I used Restasis twice a day and my prescription for glasses changes continually.\u00a0\u00a0I am 66 years old, if that makes a difference, and I do not have glaucoma or diabetes but the doctor says my optic nerves are different in each eye, and they should be the same but they haven't changed since he found them.\u00a0\u00a0This is probably too much info.\u00a0\u00a0I really want to know what to do about the eyelid not opening.",
