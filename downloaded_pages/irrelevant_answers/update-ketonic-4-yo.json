            "answer": "Lorit,Welcome back -- sorry to read that the mystery continues for you & your son.\u00a0\u00a0I imagine that it's not all that unusual for our bodies to react \"internally\" before we show outward signs of illness.\u00a0\u00a0It's likely the case that as we're developing a flu or a cold, our white blood cells are workin' hard even before we begin to get the symptoms that the \"bug\" is stronger than our initial defense system.Keep in touch with your doc.\u00a0\u00a0It's common that a1c results are given in numbers like 4.1 or 5.2 and not US blood sugar units.\u00a0\u00a0These measurements DO translate to an average BG number and that may be what you remember being told.\u00a0\u00a0The doc may've translated the a1c into an average BG number.Since labs differ on the assay they use, be sure to get the \"lab normal\" values in addition to your son's.\u00a0\u00a0I suspect that if your son's value had been out of range, you would have been directed to follow up for additional diabetes evaluation.Good luck & thanks for keeping us all posted.\u00a0\u00a0I suspect that thousands of folks are reading about this -- maybe others will have suggestions, too.",

    "question": "My son went to the on call Dr. who took the ketones in his urine very seriously.\u00a0\u00a0Fortunately it looks like my son does not have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The H-1AC(or something like that) came back at 88, and his 2 hour post prandial came back at 86.....so I think we are in good shape.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot believe a simple stomach flu can throw someone's urine ketones to a high level before he even starts s/s of the illness.\u00a0\u00a0Do you think we are out of the woods for sure?\u00a0\u00a0I checked his ketones this afternoon and they were negative.\u00a0\u00a0I am still a bit nervous.",
