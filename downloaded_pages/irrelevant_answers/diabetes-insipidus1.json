            "answer": "Run away from that doctor immediately!\u00a0\u00a0 You might be better served by a neurologist since your problem is located in your brain/pituitary and you've had brain surgery.Most endocrinologists deal with Type I or Type II diabetes (not DI), few deal with thyroid conditions and still very, very few deal with pituitary conditions.You are *not* obese - you have dealt with brain tumor, brain surgery, and now DI.Get rid of that idiot endocrinologist\u00a0\u00a0(Someone needs to slap that endo around - Chicken Club unite!)Most of us have fired an endo or two.\u00a0\u00a0I fired the chief of endocrinology at the largest hospital in my state because he did the entire \"you need to lose weight\" and ignored my thyroid cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Don't feel bad about doing it - just DO IT!What about the doctor who found and treated your tumor??My best to you.",
