After an hour they did a quick blood draw and that was that. All I had before was a piece of buttered toast to ensure I wasn't eating sugar. If needles make you nervous ask for a butterfly needle, they have wings and a much smaller needle. Just takes a little longer to fill the vial cause it's smaller.",
