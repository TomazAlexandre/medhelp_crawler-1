I think a great many of your questions will be answered.Yes, it is possible to have MS without it showing on an MRI, but this is a very complex issue. You need basic info at this point. I hope the neurologist you've been referred to is an MS specialist.Good luck and keep us posted.ess",

    "question": "I have had symptoms of ms for over a year but in 2 different episodes that were 5 months apart. I am weak on my left side ,have been choking when eating, having memory loss and other problems. I had an MRI and it came back negative so I have been referred to a neurologist. MS has been mentioned but can you have it with negative a MRI. I also have absent reflexes in my left arm and leg and when the doc had me stand up close my eyes and lift one foot at a time i kept swaying and falling. What does this indicate ? Are other diseases that cause these symptoms? I feel like I am going nuts. I also have diabetes and PAD and high blood pressure but all are very well controlled.",
