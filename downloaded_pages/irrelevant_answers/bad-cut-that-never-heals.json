            "answer": "HiSorry to hear about your wound not healing. How are you now?I\u2019ll come straight to the point. Generally such wounds that do not heal are called no-healing ulcers in medical term. They could be due to underlying infection, low supply of oxygen to the wound that is reducing the healing process, underlying diabetes, or due to underlying dermatitis.Wounds heal slower in diabetics or smokers or alcoholics who have been drinking for a long time. So these have to be ruled out.Please discuss these possibilities with your general physician and dermatologist. Get your blood examined for diabetes.Let me know what your doctors say. If you need more help, please feel free to contact. I\u2019ll be happy to answer your queries.",

            "answer": "HiThanks for keeping me posted.It feels good to hear that cheerful note in your post. That you quit smoking is an added bonus. Keep it up!Non-healing ulcers can be troublesome. At this point I\u2019ll give you just one suggestion. Try to put your weight more on the healthy leg while standing. Shift position and move your legs, this side and that, while standing for a long time. This will improve circulation to the legs and maybe reduce the discomfort.See your doctors at the earliest.If you need more help, please feel free to contact. I\u2019ll be happy to answer your queries. Please keep me posted.",

    "question": "i'll try to make it short.\u00a0\u00a0i'm 35 yrs old. and back in 1987 i was doing tricks on my bmx bike. i had these pedals called \"bear trap\" pedals. one o fthe pedals were broken in half, leaving sharp edges exposed. i however continue to ride my bike with the pedals like that. so one day im practicing tricks with my friend and bang one of th epedals slices me open near my ankle. fast forward the cut/bruise was about half index finger long and kinda dark. even though i needed stitches my mom said i didnt need em (god knows what she was thinking back in 1987) so fast forward to 6 months ago. (now i work as a building engineer) and a guy comes into the freight cargo elevator with an a-frame (these things carry sheet rock and there made of metal) and baboom hits the same cut i got 20 some what yrs ago. now i noticed a small cut, and then the whole thing opened up an dit left a dead black bruise as if the cut from 87 happened yesterday. i've applied tons of medications, spoke to doctors, asked to be operated, re-stitched. but i get the run around. what in gods name do i do.. thank you and i do apologize for the long post..-Ben",
