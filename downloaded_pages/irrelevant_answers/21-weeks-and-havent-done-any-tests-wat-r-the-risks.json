            "answer": "The testing doesn't matter as much as the anatomy scan ultrasound that they do at 20 weeks... It shows if everything is there and growing correctly on the baby, it'll show fluid levels, cervix length and many other important things... I was almost put on bed rest at 21 weeks because we found out my cervix was pretty short and I was at risk for pre-term labor and I would've never known if I wouldn't have had it. But everything besides that should be fine, just make sure around 26-30 weeks that you get a gestational diabetes test which is important for both you and baby!",
