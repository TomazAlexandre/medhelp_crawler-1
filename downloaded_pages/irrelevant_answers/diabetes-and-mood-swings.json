            "answer": "I agree with the answer given above, and just want to add that if glucose levels are either higher OR lower than normal, this physical problem can affect moods. Many people comment that their type 1 children become irritable or cranky when glucose levels are out of whack, and so a very physical reason may be behind some of her problems if her glucose levels are not in good control. So even if the problem is mostly rooted in her emotional inability to cope with stresses in life (and maybe with having a disease like type 1 diabetes), maintaining very good glucose control will certainly help remove any possible physical reasons for irritability or depression. It can only help to look closely at how tightly her sugars are controlled.But that being said, many people with chronic illnesses do require professional help, for the emotional toll is great when dealing with a daily tightrope walk that we can never get a break from walking. Some doctors actually believe that ALL type 1 diabetics should be under the care of a therapist to help us deal with this stress in a healthy manner. Feelings of anger, depression, and denial are really very common.",

Im am having similar feelings I had before I was diagnosed but my blood sugar levels are relatively under control never very high. I am having regular emotional outburst- very angry, very frustrated, very abusive, a lot of crying and screaming. I feel completely out of control, like im going crazy (losing my mind). I feel so down. Im actually jealous of people who have a healthy pancreas - how sad is that!?I feel angry with myself that im not doing a better job. If I was life would be rosy. I beat myself up over why , if im doing everything\u00a0\u00a0correct then my sugar levels should be perfect. It has started to affect my relationship with my husband. Im giving him such a hard time - i feel really guilty about this. He doesnt deserve it as he is such a loving and supportive husband. Its almost like my personality has changed and i dont like who ive become. Im due to have an insulin pump fitted in a couple of weeks i hope this will help me get tighter control. I take regular exercise, im not overweight, most of the time my sugars range from being in 'the zone' to as high as 14 - I dont know why im behaving like this. I feel embrassed bringing this up with my consultant as I get very emotional. Is this part of being diabetic?",

But saying that I\u2019m glad I am and not really that ashamed but pleased that I am taking the first steps to improve my life and those affected by my mood swings! The biggest effect it has it on my fianc\u00e9e and I only know that as he has told me that\u2019s it\u2019s my sever mood swings with him that are the problem with our relationship. After reading this website I believe this also. I think my family think this too but try to be supportive and wouldn't mention them through fear of approaching me about them. Although I researched type 1 diabetes a lot when diagnosed and think I know a lot I have either been in denial or just not known these were such a Big problem for diabetics. My control is slacking and I\u2019m not that consistent with my diet and exercise, generally my levels are around 15, Part of the day in the correct 7 - 10 but sometime reach 22. I know I should be better and today is the day when I begin from the beginning. I shall call my specialist in the morning to book an appointment to discuss this with someone in person. My partner thinks I have changed lots and after reading how we can discuss something and then forget all about it Is worrying but makes sense that I\u2019m soo forgetfully of conversations we have, probably because my levels were high. I have just left my partners after a row and handed the engagement ring back. Checked m level it was 19.9. That\u2019s why I\u2019m now researching and writing this. I know I have a problem and really want to address it and fix it. I have never been angry or sad the fact I have this condition until more recently when is ruining a good thing. I hope that in a few weeks/months my life will be back on track. Good Luck to one and all!! xx p.s sorry its so long lot to get off my chest!",

            "answer": "Hi BibiYour daughter has several things that are influencing her emotions and behavior right now: She is dealing with the emotional response to getting a diagnosis that is life changing and scary; she is possibly having the influence of both high and low blood sugars that create unstable emotions and she is in puberty which is stressful in and of itself as she is trying to define who she is and now has a chronic condition to add into the mix. So she has a lot going on, and she may not even be aware of what she is feeling or able to express it in words.None of the above, however, excuses bad behavior and I encourage you to continue to parent and set limits as you did before her diagnosis; she possibly needs the reassurance of structure even more now than before!What she may also need is some support for what she is going through: Perhaps a counselor, one aware of the impact of a chronic condition on a teen. What also might help is to meet other young people with type 1 diabetes so she has role models to relate to. There are diabetic camps which are a great experience for someone her age. Contact your local branch of the JDRF to find out the location of camp or of a support group for type 1's or type 1 teens. I will also send you by PM the name of a website where she can talk with other young people with diabetes and you can talk with other parents. It's a hard adjustment but together you can do it!",

This condition is hard enough to handle for an adult, I can't imagine what it is like for a child and for the adults who are responsible for his well-being 24/7. I'm glad your child is in therapy and I assume that the therapist will ask you to attend some of the sessions so he can help you to communicate with each other.

            "answer": "Hi! I'm also a parent of a preteen (12 yr old girl), who's also having serious mood swings and other health issues only 5-6 months into this disease. I've been dealing with an ignorant school system, who refused her any accomodations to assist her in keeping up with school.\u00a0\u00a0She's missed on average 15 days per quarter, which is too much. Due to the school's ignorance, she was not offered a 504 plan and now I'm being fined for 'truancy', which is a joke because she was so sick that she often wouldnt get out of bed. BTW, my fines have been on average $100US per day that she was absent! It's a money-making racket - Believe me! It's always about money.What I can't seem to get the nurses and school to understand is that she's so agressive towards herself (out of frustration with this awful disease), especially when she's got a high BG, that she actually hits herself in the head. I just found her cutting her arm last night, I've called the doctor's office and am waiting.\u00a0\u00a0She's begged me not to tell her father or anyone, who will probably either erupt into anger or cry himself to sleep over it. She's hurting badly and I can't seem to get anyone to see it or do anything for her! I've even threatened a major federal lawsuit via the 504 act of 1973 against the school district for their violation of federal (united states) law and discriminating against a disabled person.I'm a wreck, as I have my own chronic health problems, I do my best to take care of my own mom (who's now had 4-5 strokes overthe past 3 yrs, not to mention 3 stints) and my husband who doesn't want me discussing his issues (which is fine) but he's not working, not able to work and very depressed most of the time. Not to mention helping with the operations of both of our family businesses! Ugh!\u00a0\u00a0I understand this uphill battle all to well.I've contacted the JDRF and can honestly tell anyone who will listen that they are an invaluable resource!! Without their help and information, I'd be left with no accomodations for my child to try and have a normal life (ha!) at school and be given the same opportunity to learn as other \"normal\" kids. She actually had teachers tell her that she would fail school if she didn't get to school everyday! Some support network! What is wrong with some of these people?? Are they that heartless? She's failing 2 classes and her IQ is 129 and she made honor roll 1st qtr even missing 14 days! She was dropped from the gifted learning support, due to her attendance, which cut her deep! It's a matter of pride and accomplishment to be a part of that group and being dropped was a major blow to her psyche! I have listened in disgust too many times to the comments from school, only to get angry and proactive!\u00a0\u00a0Now, I AM MY CHILD'S ADVOCATE!\u00a0\u00a0Please hear me when I say this, only a parent (or a truly caring guardian) can be their own child's best advocate!\u00a0\u00a0Who else loves this child more than you and who else would walk thru fire for this small, helpless being! You! That's who! After all, you're the one reading this - right?!After the school principal (who's a PhD \"professional') told me that \"diabetes (type 1) is NOT a disablility!\u00a0\u00a0I lost all inhibition and went for the jugular!\u00a0\u00a0Please don't assume that the school knows best, they often DON'T!\u00a0\u00a0Take a tip from me and make sure your school (in the U.S.) provides you with the opportunity to obtain a 504 plan, which outlines accomodations for your child. Simple things like: your child will not be failed out of school for poor attendance (nor will u be fined!) and the school will provide support for your child thru any means necessary to keep your child on track at school and home, eg: tutors, homework notes, etc..I'm sorry for the length here, but there's soo much to know! Knowledge is power, people!\u00a0\u00a0Rise up and make things happen for your child and NEVER give up!\u00a0\u00a0I almost did and it nearly killed us both! Please feel free to write to me anytime, especially if you have a diabetic child, my address is ***@****, I'm in the US, but don't let that stop you!\u00a0\u00a0;). Many blessings to all parents of special children, know you are loved and appreciated for everything you do for your child, even if they can't form the words yet to thank you - they will! Hang in there and make lots of friends with other parents of diabetics and things will improve.PS - I've recently adopted a 'whole foods approach' to my diet and I'm feeling so much better (I have fibromyalgia & PTSD - very bad with all this stress) lately and I don't CRASH like I used to on processed foods. I can't seem to get my child to follow it consistently, but when she does she feels great and her BG is a lot more normal. Even if you just cut out all the processed crap, you will feel tons better! Someone told me to shop around the edges (walls) of the grocery store and that will keep you in the right food choices, but that's not always true. Just remember, if it's already in a box, bag, plastic container - read the label and if you can't pronouce it - don't buy it. Don't be fooled by the fron tof the package - it'll say it's healthy all day long then slip some god-awful preservative in there. Preservatives are for the recently deceased, not the living. Ugh!Thanks for letting me really vent!\u00a0\u00a0Blessings and Peace to you all!",
