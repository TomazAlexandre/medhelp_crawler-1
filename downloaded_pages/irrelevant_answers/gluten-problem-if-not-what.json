            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Your gluten test results do not point towards Celiac disease. No you should not have any gluten specific antibodies ideally. Also anti reticulin antibodies in not considered to be a sensitive and specific test.You should rule out IBS, Crohn\u2019s and Ulcerative colitis. With a history of insulin resistance and miscarriage, please rule out polycystic disease of the ovary.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "HiYou probably have Hashimoto\u2019s thyroidits. This can also result in constipation too. Yes slow gut motility too is possible. Diabetes and hypothyroidism are the commonest causes of this. Please consult an endocrine specialist and maybe your problems will be managed better. IBS too can present in a similar way with constipation instead of diarrhea. Also keep a food stress diary to see whether any particular type of food causes more problems.Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi,After years of struggling with the following symptoms- (I have all of the typical symptoms of celiac with an exception of the diareah-- instead I have CHRONIC severe constipation, fatigue, insulin resistance, hypothyroidism (which is controlled with meds-- but my thyroid perodase antibodies were over 1,000 range 0-35) 3 early miscarriages). I got bloodwork done to see if I have celiac ... I am not sure if it measure gluten sensitivity/intolerance... but I am hoping for someone's thought's on my results. (I was gluten free for only a day before the test was taken- and I had a piece of light wheat toast the morning I went for the bloodwork --that all probably doesn't have much effect though as overall- I am sure that I have consumed a lot of gluten of the 4th of JUly weekend).BTW- I got the results and have yet to hear from my doc regarding them. Thanks for your help:GLIADIN IGA.....3 (Reference Range: 17 Positive)GLIADIN IGG...<3 (Reference Range: same as above)RETICULIN IGA.....NEGATIVETTG IGA.....<3 (Reference Range: 8 PositiveENDOMYSIAL AB..........NEGATIVEIGA....290TTG IGG....<3So do you think I shouldn't go this route anymore -- or do you think I may still have concerning matters with gluten to figure out? How accurate are these results? Should I have ANY GLIADIN IGA anyway?ThanksDawn",
