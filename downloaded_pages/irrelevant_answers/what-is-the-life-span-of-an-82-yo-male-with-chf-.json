If we all knew when ourlast day was going to be, we would all be repenting the day before death so we could live life to the full. Thats why its a surprise.",

            "answer": "There is no one that can predict the years left for a patient with CHF.\u00a0\u00a0But the last stage of life prior to cardiac arrest for CHF would be a respiratory problem with lung edema requiring a diuretic and possibly an outside source of oxygen.\u00a0\u00a0Inability to do any activities (even walk for a short distance) without severe shortness of breath, dry cough, chest pain probably can be controlled or not.\u00a0\u00a0Eventually a weak heart will cause an arrhythmia (irregular fluttering heatbeats and blood clots) and very low blood pressure and cardiac arrest.High blood pressure can cause a stroke and/or coma without warning as the brain vessels may burst from the high bp at any time.Whether one is in the last stage of life depends on symptoms,\u00a0\u00a0how effective the treatment, etc.",

            "answer": "Hi-- A lot depends on how severe the heart failure is and what's causing it (high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, atrial fibrillation, heart valve problems, etc.) and also, how severe the dementia is and how high the blood pressure is.My Dad is 84 and had heart failure problems that got worse over about a 2-year period. In July of 2008, he had to have triple bypass surgery, his aortic valve replaced, and an aneurysm repaired. He has some mild dementia and is doing OK a year later.",
