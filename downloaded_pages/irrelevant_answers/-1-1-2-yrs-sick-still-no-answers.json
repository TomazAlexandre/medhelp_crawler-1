            "answer": "Hi Angie,What diagnosis your doctor has told you?What are your core symptoms? Do you have anxiety or stress?Is there any cyst or lesion at the base of skull? Any findings which suggests that there could be some neurovascular pathology?Have you been tested for Diabetes?Have you consulted any psychologist so far? If yes, what does he have to say about this?I think the doctors are trying to rule out any organic pathology that might be present by doing several investigations.My questions are targeted to find out some disease pathology.Keep me informed.Bye.",

    "question": "21 years old I have been sick now almost a year and a half, I have had multiple MRI, Spine MRI, ( no leasions) spinal tap (10 cogolobal bands, 14 white blood cells May 07) Head aches every day, even with Topamax. I have been put on Solumedral 2 times within the past year to help with these head aches. I have upper back spasms and lower very painful. Numbness in both hands. Had weird feeling when I moved head downward but that has since gone away for now. Tingling in feet somtimes. All I want is an honest answer. I am going out of my mind going from Dr. to Dr. and getting no where. I was first diagnosed with Optic Nuritis and my eye still bothers me. I do not know why it is taking so long for an answer but I feel like I am loosing all control of my life. I can never get help from my new Dr. my old Dr. was pushing me out of his office everytime I was having problems. I cant help but feel like I should just give up.",
