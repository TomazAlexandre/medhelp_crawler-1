            "answer": "that sounds just slightly above average to me. i think at 30 weeks the baby should weight roughly 3lbs and your alittle past that point. so sounds like your on track. i recently had an ultrasound for the same reason at about 30 wks 5days but wont hear what they saw until i see my ob this Tuesday. i have gestesinal diabetes so that's why i was sent for the ultrasound. im measuring normal so im hoping to be around 3-4 lbs too. im guessing like you said you make big healthy babies nothing wrong with that! there hasn't been a baby in my family under 8lbs like ever so even before i got diagnosed with gd i was anticipating a big baby.",

    "question": "I went for my ultrasound today and the lady said the baby is 4 pounds already iam kinda worried also my gestational diabetes test was borderline, could that be one reason hes big. My son was 8 pds 8 ounces my daughter was 6 pds 12 ounces and my third child weighed 8 pds. 12 ounces. I have healthy pregnancies and maybe its normal for me to have bigger boys. Positive answers are welcome :)",
