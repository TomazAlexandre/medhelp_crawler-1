            "answer": "Hi,How are you? The amount fluid intake by you is appropriate. Coming to nocturia it can occur due to a variety of conditions like diabetes, prostatic hyperplasia etc.It would be better you get a check of blood sugars. Cramps in the calfs can occur due to dehydration, over exertion of muscles, alcohol, due to some drugs etc.I think that cramps in the calf could be due to dehydration, but nocturia should be evaluated. Get a check of your blood sugars and take the opinion of your physician.Take care.",

            "answer": "Thanks so much for getting back in touch. Have lived with this for a long time and feel lonely with it, by myself. I have a history of enuriesis as a child until I reached 13 years of age (and occaisonally wetting myself whilst awake i.e when walking home from school). I can't sleep on my front as causes my tummy to much pain. This would be a prefable position due to minor scoliosisI suffer from frequent sciatica and occasional numbness in my groin area (unsure if two are related). I also have spina bifida occulta.Thanks again.P.S I don't know what it's like in the U.S but here in the U.K gps are pretty unapproachable and not what the T.V makes them out to be. I've kind of lost faith in mine wishing I could go back to my old one but can't as I live just outside the catchment area. I have no faith in the NHS and feel very uncomfortable approaching my gp. Any tips on how to get your gp to give you the best service they can?Thanks and thanks for bothering for those outside the U.S",
