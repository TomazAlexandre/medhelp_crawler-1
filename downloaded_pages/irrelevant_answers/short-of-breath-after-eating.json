            "answer": "I wish I could help. I have the same problem and had the same tests. My stomach was scoped 4 years ago. I actually start the shortness of breath while I'm eating. It takes me twice as long to finish a meal as my husband. I am 20 pounds overweight and wonder if that is the issue. Like there is too much extra weight on my diaphram or something. I actually choke a lot when I eat and drink as well. Hope your DR can provide you with more help this week. Please keep me posted. Best wishes!",

            "answer": "First of all don't know what is causing your problem. I can suggest one possible cause. Diabetes. The mechanism is this: When you have diabetes and the insulin supply is exhausted an alternative mechanism is available to take care of the sugar. This mechanism usually causes a sweet fruity smelling urine(those are ketone bodies). Another affect is to raise the acidity of the blood.This in turn causes inflamation of the alveoli and can precipitate an asthmatic-like attack and shortnessof breath.",

    "question": "Hello,I am a 48 year old female with a history of slight congestive heart failure. Over the past year I have had an ongoing problem with being short of breath after I eat a meal. It seems to happen more often in the evening. I spoke with my cardiologist because I thought that it may have something to do with my heart. He doesn't seem to think that my heart has anything to do with this problem. I have had my stomach scoped within this past year and all that was found is a bit of stomach lesions (ulcer). I have seen an allergist and so far no one can figure out why this is happening. I am going back to the doctor this week. I am\u00a0\u00a0very frustrated with it all and I don't know what to think. It is very scary when you can't breath. Any suggestions?Thank you!!!",
