            "answer": "Do you by chance have the numbers of the pump supplies? I know mine have different numbers and I have a new paradigm and I think I may have some supplies left over from my old pump. But I have to try and find them. If you could give me the numbers of the reservoirs and infusion sets I will try and find them and see if they are your type. I hope I can find them cause I didn't know what to do with them. Hopefully my husband didn't get rid of them yet. Thanks and God Bless.",
