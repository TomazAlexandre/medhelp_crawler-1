            "answer": "I am going back on bc so my period can be regular again and the dr said that it would keep me from getting cysts.

Does that help with depression?My husband is not ready for children yet so until that time I won't be taking any kind of fertility pills.

I will be talking to my gyno when that time comes though.also, i don't have diabetes but the dr said i probably will within a few years time.",

            "answer": "Metformin, is not for depression...it's really meant to help with diabetes and insulin resistant. I don't have either, but my doctor thought it would be great if I started on it, and really I am happy I did. It helps with your cycles over time to be more normal. I've been on it, this will be going on 3 years in September 2010 and I started it while on birth control. I stopped my birth control in August 2009 and have had a normal period with cycles ranging in 28-32 days. I have no pain throughout the month, and no excess bleeding other then my period (which lasts only 2 days and 1 day of spotting after). If your depressed, you should speak to your doctor about this as this is another type of symptom some women get with PCOS. He/she may be able to prescribe you something that will help with the depression. I do not suffer from it, so I'm not sure what meds will help. Also, I wanted to point out...that not all women who have PCOS have a heard time becoming pregnant. It's not impossible...just some have more harder times then others.I suggest to when you see your doctor, suggest if he/she will let you try metformin and also let them know about the depression. Metformin is not for everybody, but it is the most common drup given to those who suffer with PCOS.",
