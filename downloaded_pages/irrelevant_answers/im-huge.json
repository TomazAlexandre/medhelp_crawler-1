            "answer": "When I was around 24 or 25 weeks, I hadn't gained hardly any weight and suddenly I gained 15 pounds in a month! They say 25-30 pounds is normal over the whole pregnancy but some women do it in quick spurts and level out toward the end. Don't worry about it too much. Some women gain up to 70 pounds or more! If you really are worried, have your doc test for gestational diabetes and make sure not to drink soda and eat alot of fatty foods",
