            "answer": "Nobody can diagnose you online and if it continues you should see your doctor. It hasn't been very long that you have been experiencing this and it is not accompanied by thirst which is usually the case with diabetes so I'm inclined to think it might be something else like a urinary tract infection, or maybe nothing at all. If you want reassurance about diabetes and your brother lives nearby you could have him check your blood sugar. Otherwise just wait and if it doesn't improve in a few days or you experience some other things, see your doctor. That would be my suggestion.",

    "question": "So, my brother has juvenile diabetes but didn't show signs and was not diagnosed till he was almost 23 years old. Yes, I am sure it is type 1. I am a 21 year old female and for the past couple days I have had to go pee almost every hour. Not at night - just during the day. It isn't just that I feel the urge to go pee. I actually have to pee. It doesn't smell weird or anything. It doesn't burn. It's totally clear - no yellowish tint. I haven't been drinking any more water than usual. I know that frequent urination is a sign of diabetes so I am concerned. Are there any other signs of diabetes I should look for? Any other possible explanations? I would love to put my mind at ease.",
