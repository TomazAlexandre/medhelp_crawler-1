            "answer": "Hello Zinzi,First i'd like to Welcome you to the Pain Management Forum and let you know that we are pleased that you have joined the Forum. You need to know that there are NO Doctors on this Forum and they don't even monitor it. We are all CP (Chronic Pain) Patients that help each other by sharing our own experiences with each other.I'm very sorry for the problems that you have been experiencing lately with the Headaches, Frequent Thirst and Frequent Urination. Remember that I am NOT a Dr. but I would advise you to see a Dr. as soon as you can as these are classic symptoms for Diabetes. My husband suffered from diabetes from the time that he was in his late 'teens until his death when he was 52 years old.Please don't put this off as this is a terribly debilitating disease and IF you do have this you need to get on top of it as soon as possible. Does Diabetes run in your Family? The diabetes can effect your arteries and blood vessels in your brain which can effect your memory and your headaches.I hope that you will get back to us and give us an update as I'm quite concerned about you.Best wishes.....Sherry",

            "answer": "I'm really glad that you are going to check that out. My husband had all of these same symptoms that you are having.I'm keeping my fingers crossed that you won't have it. Since your Mum has it you know how important it is to take care of yourself. Unfortunately, sometimes no matter what we do we can't keep from getting something that is hereditary. However, you can certainly do something to be sure that you keep it under control.Please let me know how your test goes. I'm hoping for the very best for you....Sherry",
