            "answer": "Hi,I think this is prediabetes.You cannot afford to lose weight, in fact it would be ideal if you could gain a little.From what you are describing your diet is low fat.\u00a0\u00a0I think you should cut\u00a0\u00a0back the carbs further and add more unprocessed healthy fats.The diet should follow the paleo principles.\u00a0\u00a0Low carb, moderate protein, high fat.\u00a0\u00a0Fat can come from unprocessed nut oils (coconut, olive), cream, butter, cheese, animal fats and lard, eggs, avocado, nuts.Use your meter to work out what foods don't make you high and then you can focus on these.Pizza is a tough one because it is high carb, but it digests slowly due to all the fat and can cause you to become high much later.\u00a0\u00a0This could explain the 4 hours to come down.You could also go to watch the lectures on Utube at Bernstein Diabetes University for heaps of information about managing diabetes / prediabetes with low carb.You probably should bget your Hba1c tested every 6 months or so, so you can monitor if there are changes.\u00a0\u00a05.4 gives you an average blood sugar of about 110.\u00a0\u00a0A normal blood sugar average should be < 100.\u00a0\u00a0 So only slightly high, but warning enough that you need to take action and change your lifestyle now.",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for your advice.\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned it could be prediabetes also.\u00a0\u00a0I can't figure out why I passed that Oral Glucose Tolerance Test though, when clearly certain foods are spiking me much higher than that Glucose drink did?And of course, some Doctors only look at that one OGTT test and not the whole picture, and say I am fine, especially when they see I am not even close to being overweight...so tell me to do nothing.\u00a0\u00a0I say some of those numbers are too high - lets get them down asap!I do eat Paleo through the week so I will keep that up, thank you.\u00a0\u00a0It is very interesting which foods cause a spike and which do not.\u00a0\u00a0I thought for sure that restaurant egg, sausage, & cheese quesadilla with hash browns would spike me, but I was only 79 after that!\u00a0\u00a0Pizza is a whole different story though.Thanks again for all your help.",

            "answer": "You're having eight or more splurges a month while you appear to have prediabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Those are including pizzas, hot fudge sundaes, and hamburgers&fries.I urge you to cut down to one or two splurges a month.\u00a0\u00a0But you may want to transition to this level over two or three months, and may find halving some of the splurge quantities a useful interim step.It's REALLY hard to break an established habit without repercussions, merely modifying habits can be so much easier, so I suggest modify a habit by perhaps making up for the missing splurges by swapping those ones for snacking on air popped popcorn without oil or salt.\u00a0\u00a0Your weight and body fat levels are fine so if you're hungry, add a serving of your healthier food choices as needed.You might give thought to destressing (you say you're not especially stressed, but to me that suggests you're coping with stress, I urge you to sneak in some quiet 'me' time every day).\u00a0\u00a0And perhaps replace some of your more vigourous workouts each week with long walks?\u00a0\u00a0(I get a lot more out of such long walks when I'm not plugged into some music.)",
