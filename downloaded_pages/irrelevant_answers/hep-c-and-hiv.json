            "answer": "I have a family member thats in your situation. It is not easy they also have medically induced diabetes. He had to enter into a special program call HART in order to get a transplant. Once transplanted it is a very sensitive process trying to balance your HIV meds with your immune suppressant meds, but it is being done successfully. Your Dr's will monitor you more closely than they do us and your meds will constantly be adjusted. My family member is always having some medical issues because of this, but so far these small fires have been put out and he is doing just fine. His kidneys and blood pressure are under a lot of strain and he suffers from fatigue a lot. If you are able try to exercise and watch your diet very carefully. We are all in this together...hang in there GOD has your back. You would not have come this far if he didn't.....GOD BLESS!!......Dan",
