    "question": "Hope you can help.... I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0I take metformin for the diabetes and simvastatin for the cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0Recently, (just the last few days), my ears have steadily grown in \"fullness\".\u00a0\u00a0It happens mainly at night when I lay down to sleep.\u00a0\u00a0Most times I just fall asleep and wake up fine.\u00a0\u00a0But tonight, when the fullness came on, I started feeling dizzy while laying down and that started a litlle anxiety episode and here it is 3+ hours later.\u00a0\u00a0So, the question is, can either of these prescriptions cause the fullness in both ears like this?Other info that might help.\u00a0\u00a0The weather changed here about 5 days ago from freezing and snow to just above freezing and rain.\u00a0\u00a0Could this just be some kind of sinus infection brought on by the change in weather?I tried holding my nostrils and mouth shut and exhaling slowly to see if it would \"pop\" the ears, yawning, I even sneezed a few times and nothing seems to be able to break it.\u00a0\u00a0I took an aspirin thinking it may be blood pressure and that didnt do the trick either, it did seem to help a little but not enough to alleviate the symptoms.At this time, I take 500-750 mg of metformin per day and 20 mg of simvastatin at bedtime.Any answers could help.Thanks in advance.",
