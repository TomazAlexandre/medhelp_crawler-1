            "answer": "The epiglottis guards the entrance of the glottis, the opening between the vocal folds.It is normally pointed upward, but during swallowing, elevation of the hyoid bone draws the larynx upward; as a result, the epiglottis folds down to a more horizontal position. In this manner it prevents food from going into the trachea and instead directs it to the esophagus, which is more posterior.The epiglottis is one of nine cartilaginous structures that make up the larynx (voice box). (There are 3 single laryngeal cartilages: thyroid, epiglottis, cricoid and also 3 paired laryngeal cartilages: arytenoid, cuneiform and corniculate).[edit] Clinical significance[edit] ReflexesThe glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) sends fibers to the upper epiglottis that contribute to the afferent limb of the gag reflex. The superior laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve (CN X) sends fibers to the lower epiglottis that contribute to the afferent limb of the cough reflex. [2][edit] Infection of the epiglottisIn children, the epiglottis will occasionally become infected with Haemophilus influenzae or Streptocoche in the trachea, causing massive inflammation.Sounds like that's the reason to her gag reflex/vomitting.\u00a0\u00a0The other symptoms seems to be unrelated, and I'm sure they don't help.\u00a0\u00a0Rashes could suggest many things, definitely seems like her immune system is going haywire.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest taking her to a reumatologist, and if that doesn't work, search through the natural route, see somebody who is into natural medicine who is also a practicing doctor.",

            "answer": "Thank you all for your feedback. We have since had an emergency room visit for her throat when it swelled almost shut. A round of steroids has brought down some of the swelling, but the epiglottis is still raised. We went back to the pediatric gastro when our family doc said that it may be the reflux aggravating her throat. She has ordered an extensive round of blood work that checked just about every box on a lab slip - including the blood sugars. Two week wait time, I'll let you know what we hear.",

    "question": "My question is about my 4 yr old and since it is many layered I don't know where to post it. A visit for an earache today brough a routine check of her throat. The doctor stated that she had never seen an epiglottis that big, and called in another doctor who said the same thing. They didn't tell us much about what that meant one way or another and I'm hoping to find out. I'd like to tell you some history though because it seems like she has one thing after another. From birth she had severe GERD, projectile vomiting et cetera that she seemed to mostly grow out of. I say mostly because she has a \"weak stomach\". Her vomit reflex is amazing. If she starts coughing, smells something bad, anything, she gags and vomits very easily and it's still projectile vomiting. She has unexplained rashes that appear and disappear without reason, sometimes as large blotches, sometimes as though fishnet stockings are covering her skin. Most of these rashes appear on her face. She also has bad asthma (a family trait) that has had her hospitalized a few times. Another unexplained issue is that she is never full or hydrated. She will inhale a drink to the point that she is coughing for breath when she's done and ask for more. If we don't stop her she will continue to eat until she vomits. She's always hungry or thirsty and the amount of times she urinates is probably record setting. I've been researching the epiglottis, but everything says that with no history of reflux (which she has a history of) or sleep apnea (which she has symptoms of - snoring - stopping breathing in her sleep, noises when sleeping) or of breathing restrictions (which we can't determine from the asthma) that it's ok. So what does it mean if those 3 things aren't the case???",
