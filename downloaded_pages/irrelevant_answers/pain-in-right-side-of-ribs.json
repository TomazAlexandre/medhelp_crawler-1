            "answer": "Pain on the ribs, abdomen and back on the right side has many causes.As you have done ultrasound and X-ray you rule out major causes.There are many minor causes like abdominal muscle strain, trauma, injury or pain due to improper sleep position at night. Please try to recollect if you had any interaction by which you had any of the above things?If not take some pain killers and the pain should go away and if it continues you need a detailed examiniation like a CT scan and you have to co-relate the cases between a gastroenterologist and a Radiodiagnosis physician.",

            "answer": "keep getting tests, that answer was bull, sorry to say it but its true, you know if you are in pain thats your bodys way of saying HELLO something is WRONG here. I am having that pain you are having for 2 years, Ive had some test but nothin extensive as I dont have great health insureance. Pain killers actually do NOT take the pain away and its miserable for\u00a0\u00a0years now, finally after 2 yrs new symptoms have came into play and it almost seems as if something is just attacking the whole right side of my body? pain in right ribs, and in chest under my right breast,pain in right arm and armpit, weakness in right thigh pain pain pain like hell in my temple jaw and ear (rightside of course) nausea and now severe headaches, just all kinds of **** and ALL of it on the right side-these come and go but the on thing that is constant is the pain in my rib and chest and backIknow something is wrong, I also know most docs just arent going to take the time to try to find something out of the ordinary-",

            "answer": "Pain killers are only for intermittent relief and should not be taken in a continous way but they give you some relief to the present problem. For chronic problem and where the diagnosis is important you have to go for all the possible tests to determine the cause. You would need a multispecialty to find out what is causing this sometimes. Neurologist and Orthopaedican in your case. Most of the diagnosis takes place at primary level but some problems take time to be diagnosed over a period of time with following up. Doctors cannot do\u00a0\u00a0magic but rather help the patient to find out the reason and treating the cause, symptoms in a scientific and time tested way.",

            "answer": "I too have most of the same issues as you. I have tested neg to every test Drs have done. I havent had and test done on my kidney. I have had a chronic pain in my right side under my ribs for about 6 months. I cant even do a sit up. I also have digestive issues. Than after I eat I get pain that jumps all over my body! I have cut out gluten but still have that chronic pain but seem to digest food better, Dairy I think makes it worse too! I have been scoped and tested for everything with no results but some inflammation in my stomach. My ankles are also swollen! I have recently noticed tiny red pinmarks on my fingernail bed.",
