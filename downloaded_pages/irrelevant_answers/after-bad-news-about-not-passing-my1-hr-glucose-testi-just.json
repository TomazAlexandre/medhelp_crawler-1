            "answer": "At first they feel like flutters or gas bubbles, then they turn into little kicks! When you get in your 3rd trimester it looks pretty crazy & they begin to hurt! Lol also don't stress about failing your test.. You will probably just have to monitor your blood everyday and so some dieting. I got diagnosed at 28 weeks with gestational diabetes amd was very upset and scared. But mine has been under complete control and my baby looks great! Good luck.",
