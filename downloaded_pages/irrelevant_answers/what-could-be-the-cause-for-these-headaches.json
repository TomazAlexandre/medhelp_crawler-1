            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Can you elaborate on the blood circulation problem seen on your last MRI? Were you ale to take medications for this? It would really help to know your medical history. You can have a follow-up with your doctor and discuss the results of the MRI and have the dizziness and loss of balance evaluated further to rule out eye or ear issues, vertigo and medical conditions such as anemia or diabetes. One-sided throbbing headaches usually are associated with migraine headaches. These are managed with both preventive and abortive medications, rest, and avoidance of triggers. Take care and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hi,Thank you for your update.It is good that vertigo, anemia and diabetes were all ruled out. During puberty, hormone levels go awry and this may also be considered. Rest in dark rooms and ice packs may help. There is a headache tracker here in the forum that may also help. Although the MRI will help us rule out pathological issues. Do keep us posted with the results. Take care always.",

            "answer": "Ok, i've asked my mum, turns out it was a CT scan, no idea if that's the same as MRI (I know nothing about medicine). She said she doesn't remember what the results indicated, and that we will head up to the doctor to ask him for the results. I do recall the doctor saying that that there were no immediate concerns, however the scan was roughly a year ago.",

            "answer": "Hi,How was the appointment with your attending physician? CT scan and MRI are both imaging studies used to rule out any anatomical pathology.\u00a0\u00a0Discuss the result with your doctor especially the circulation issues to better understand the diagnosis. Write down the questions you want to ask and if the answers are not clear, try to ask for clarifications to ease any anxiety. Take care and hope to hear from you soon.",

            "answer": "Please see a neurologist and mention Chiari Malformation to them! Every symptom you are explaining sounds like it! (There&#39;s a lot more symptoms) but those are some of the main ones. Look it up and educate yourself also before you see a neurologist because they will make you feel like it&#39;s not a big deal but it is! Their are Chiari Facebook pages too. You need a MRI to determine it. And you need to have your CSF checked. (Your spinal fluid flow) I know you posted this a long time ago so idk if you&#39;ve found a solution but if not I hope this helps!",

    "question": "Hello, I am a 16 year old male, and for about a year and a half i have been having strange headaches. For the past year I have always had a slight headache, annoying, but nothing out of the ordinary type of headache. Although often, usually once or twice a week this headache intensifies. Symptoms that accompany this are usually heightened sensitivity to light in one of both eyes, this last for a few hours, an occasional minor loss of balance and dizziness. My friends constantly tell me of my poor memory and trouble with words, whether this has something to do with the headaches I am not sure. On rare occasions, I get very severe headaches, mostly debilitating. It feels like a large pressure inside my head, and people have describe that my face changes from bright red to pale white every few seconds when this occurs. When this happens, it lasts for usualy 1 to 2 hours. An MRI scan I had a while back, not sure how long exactly, showed that I had some sort of blood circulation problems, although I have no further understanding on what this was. I have pretty much no medical knowledge so this confuses me greatly. any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",
