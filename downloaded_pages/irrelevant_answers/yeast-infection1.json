            "answer": "Hi!I am not sure where you have yeast infection: skin, vaginal or systemic? Only systemic or fungal infection in blood can lower your blood pressure. Skin and vaginal yeast infection is cured by local application of antifungal creams (separate for skin and vagina) and systemic infection is cured by oral tablets. You may need to take the tablets for skin and vaginal infection too.Dehydration, certain medications, heart problems, untreated diabetes, and nervous system disorders can all cause hypotension or low blood pressure. Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Addisons\u2019 disease, hypoglycemia, VitB12 and folate deficiency can also cause hypotension. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
