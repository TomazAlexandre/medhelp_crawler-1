            "answer": "Hi,I understand your concern regarding your results. Hematuria can be caused by a variety of issues such as infection, inflammation of the kidney, urethra, bladder, or prostate as well as blood issues. ON the other hand, proteinuria, a sign of chronic kidney disease (CKD) may\u00a0\u00a0result from diabetes, high blood pressure, and diseases that cause inflammation in the kidneys.. Since hematuria was first observed, this could be one factor in the finding protein in the urine at present. It is best that you discuss this also with your attending physician for proper evaluation. Factors such as your medical history, symptoms present and results of other laboratory tests are important considerations also. Additional diagnostic tests may need to be done to determine the underlying cause. Take care and do keep us posted.",
