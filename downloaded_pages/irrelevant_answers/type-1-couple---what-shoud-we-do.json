            "answer": "I'm not part of a type-1 couple, but I'm the mother of a type-1 17-year-old girl (who already has names picked out for future children) and the wife of a man with a host of genetically-based health issues: type-2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and a history of autoimmune diseases on his father's side, which is where my daughter seems to have inherited her diabetes.We knew NONE of that when we married and had kids. It saddens me that one child has diabetes and the other has the risk of all sorts of things (MS, Crohn's and RA all appear in aunts and great-aunts). But do I wish we never had them? ABSOLUTELY NOT. They are beautiful, smart, life-loving girls with great futures ahead of them. One has to manage a disease, and the other might have to manage something herself one day, but everyone has to deal with challenges in life. Some have emotional issues, some have damaged families, some have to deal with cancer or accidents or who knows what.So that's my two cents. Do what your hearts tell you. Future children may develop diabetes, or maybe they won't. Maybe they'll have other burdens. But that doesn't mean they won't be happy, wonderful people.Good luck to you.",

            "answer": "I am a type 1 diabetic, but I'm also single so I can't answer from a personal perspective. I wanted to tell you about a woman named Kassie Gregorio Palmer who is a type 1 diabetic and married to a type 1 diabetic. She and her husband have 2 boys, both do not have diabetes. She writes a blog called Noncompliant, http://noncompliant.blogspot.com. She also wrote a book called When You're a Parent with Diabetes and you can visit that website at www.parentswithdiabetes.com.Obviously you have to study the statistics and make a decision that you and your husband are comfortable with and can live with. If you don't chose to have biological children, there is adoption too. Whatever you decide, I hope you and your husband have a good life together!",

You will have to be very strict and keep excellent control before and during your pregnancy.Ultimately, you have to weigh the pros and cons.\u00a0\u00a0My choice is adoption but I am 100% in support of people having their own children.\u00a0\u00a0Who's to say I don't adopt a child and a few years later they develop diabetes or some other disease?Follow your heart and go with what you think will be best for you and your family.",
