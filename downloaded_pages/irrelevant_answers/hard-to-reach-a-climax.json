            "answer": "Hello,What you seem to be having is anorgasmia. It can be due to many causes like psychological fear, fear of non performance, ejaculation dysfunction which can be due to diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression and neurological causes, smoking, muscle weakness, chronic use of cocaine, opioids and amphetamines, diabetes and hypertension.My sincere advice would be to consult a urologist and get evaluated for these possibilities.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "I don't use drugs so that is ruled out. I do smoke and have a tendancy to drink too many soft drinks. I didn't have any problems until I seperated from my ex-wife which was pretty tramatizing. My sugar was checked and is normal. heart, circulation, muscle weakness, hypertension, and low testosterone is I think the targets I should look at. I don't excersise like I should do to my job, seemed to be stressed out alot, and I had the testosterone levels checked. Waiting for the results on that. I do stay depressed alot too. The last 4 years of my life have been pretty tough. Thank you so much for your help. I will keep you posted on what the doc says. One good thing is my girlfriend is pretty happy. LOL.",

    "question": "For the past 2 years I have had a very hard time reaching climax with a woman.\u00a0\u00a0I can masturbate and reach climax in about 15 to 30 minutes. With a woman it takes 2 hours plus if I do at all. I recently had a vesectomy and asked the doctor about it. He gave me cialis but I still have the same problem. Is there anything I can do or take that will help? I wondered if it was a low testostrone or circulation problem. I am very concerned about my condition.",
