            "answer": "Hi,How old are you?Has this been happening for a while?When you say numbness, you actually can not feel anything in the entire shaft of the penis or only in specific sites.You just have to observe this for a while. The sensation resolves without any intervention (is this correct?) and there are no associated problems with erection, ejaculation and urination. However, if you are diabetic, or if there was any previous history of trauma to the area or any prior nerve related disorders then a prompt consult is necessary.Do you have diabetes?Was there any history of trauma to the area?",

            "answer": "Hi,Sorry for incomplete information. I am 27 year old. This has been happening since I started having regular sex ( For few months now ). This normally happens after the skin on the penis has had a lot of up and down motion during sex. The numbness just feels on the entire area as if a local anaesthetia has been given and lasts for a few minutes.There are no problems with erection, ejaculation or urination.Neither me nor my family descent has been diabetic or has any history of such trauma. All I can add is my late mother had both kidney failures and spent all her life in hospital.Do you think I should wait and watch or take it seriously? Also I am a heavy smoker.Kindly help. Thanks.",
