            "answer": "Good luck!!(:> I am a ftm too and planning on natural birth too, so I'd love to hear how your induction goes. It is very much possible to have a successfully natural induction! Breathe, don't tense up, try and relax as much as possible, utilize as many upright positions as possible and walk walk walk!! I'm currently 40+2 and worried I'll have to induce next week.",

            "answer": "I have birth on the 13th naturally and for me\u00a0\u00a0transition was the hardest. Early on I could breath through contractions and standing leaning forward helped as well as sitting on the edge of the bed or toilet. The contractions during transition were much more intense and were accompanied by a feeling similar to the throw up reflex except with a downward thrust instead of up. You will know you are getting really close when you reach this stage. I found making noise very helpful too,more so than the specific breathing patterns you learn at most birthing classes. Especially in later labor loud helped. Pushing was the easiest part for me.\u00a0\u00a0You might feel burning etc but you will be so happy to be pushing instead of having the transition contractions, especially if the baby is in a good position!",

            "answer": "Had 4 babies with induction as my kids like to be over cooked I suppose! (#5 due date 18th!) I did use some iv pain meds, narcain which took off the edge... Breathe and focus. While being induced, I was never aloud to walk around only close to monitor in room, standing near bed, rocking chair, ball etc. Know that even though it hurts, the pain is temporary only with a wonderful end and focus on that result!!!",
