            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include stress/ anxiety, hormonal/ endocrine abnormalities, dry skin, infection, inflammation, allergy, insect bites, fungal infection, dermatitis, allergies, hives, scabies, liver diseases causing jaundice, renal diseases, metabolic disorders etc. Without a clinical evaluation it would be difficult to differentiate between the causes or suggest a treatment plan. I would suggest getting this evaluated by a primary care physician or a dermatologist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.Hope this is useful.Take care!",
