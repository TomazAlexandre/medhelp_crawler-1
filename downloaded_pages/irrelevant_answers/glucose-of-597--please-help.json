            "answer": "my wife is in and out of the hospital. they thought she was a type 2. she is 36 years old. we came to find out she is a type 1. glucose between low 30's and high 600's. how we found out was her Diabetic doctor took her off all her meds and the next day I had to call 911. \" great Doc huh\". when she was in the ER her blood was 689. they asked me why she was not on medication for type 1 and I told them what her Doctor did and they told me they did't know if they could save her. I later found out her Doctor had blinded a woman who had type 1 by taking her off her Meds. with all my wife has been through you should trust your gut and if the metformin is not working you have type 1, not 2 and should go to another Doctor. PLEASE Help yourself ! I woke up at 430 AM to my wife in bad shape tested her and she was a 38.GOD it is so hard on me to see her that way. we do everything right and she still has problems.24 years together and to see her go through it kills me. I hope you have better luck then my wife. Vince.....",
