            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!It is probably extreme exhaustion along with probably dehydration. Increase your fluid intake\u2014soups, lemonade, juices etc and see if it helps. Also you can take a multivitamin for a short period and see. If nothing helps test for anemia, diabetes and thyroid problems.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
