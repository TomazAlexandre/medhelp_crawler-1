            "answer": "Is it possible that you Oed really late? Based on LMP I am 7w1d but based on gestation I am 6w1d so if I went by LMP my #s would be considered lower than they should be, I guess. That said, your #s are in fact quite low and should be doublin every 48 hours- 72 hours longest doubling time for early pg. Have you had an u/s? By 6 weeks they should be able to see the heart beat so I would definitely opt for an u/s to know how your pgs really going. Wishing you the best of luck.",

            "answer": "Hi Ladies, need your advice. I posted at the beginning of the week thinking I had ovulated early. Not sure. Feb 15/06 spotted, Feb 17/06 bled, period lighter than normal. Not due now until Mar 17/06. I haven't been feeling well at all. I exercise regularly but for the past few days I have been having a strange sensation in my lower abdomen. When I try to exercise I seem to have this awareness and slight feeling - not pain almost like butterflies - hard to explain. I'm just wondering if its ovulation or implantation or nothing at all. Has anyone experienced anything like this. My son is 9 and so trying to remember how I felt that long ago is difficult.Thank you again for your advice.",

Just keep praying about it. We will too. i'm the flip side of your situation. I'm waiting to hear the results of my bloodwork from yesterday. My progesterone was low last week (it was 13.5 on 2/20; but my hcg was good) and i started taking Prometrium. Yesterday i went back for another test, so they're supposed to have the lab results (progesterone and hcg) in about 2 hours (11:30 Central time). I'm trying not to think about it, but we all know that's impossible. I just need everyone's prayers that all is well. I will let y'all know as soon as i know something. thanks!!!!!",

            "answer": "Niloo~ As far as a symptomless pregnancy, I had that with my second. When I decided to test I wsnt feeling sick or weird or anything. With my first I did. Nonetheless I had thought I was a day late for my period so I thought about testing. Since I had been to GYN shortly before that, I called them up ( I am friends with someone there) and had her pull my records for lmp since we tell it whenever we go. As it turned out I was over a WEEK late for af!! I tested that night and got bfp. I had no symptons at all with that pregnancy which was TOTAL opposite from my first. I couldn't even finish a meal without getting sick with that little booger. Ended up having a complicated first pregnancy. In the end, not only are people different, but pregnancies can be different too! At this point if everything else is otherwise fine, I would say count your blessings! Lots of women would love to be pregnancy without the yucky side effects! lolEveryone~ I posted last week about my issue and its continuing, didnt want to take another whole posting for it (unfair). But in a nutshell, lmp was 2/6, due for next on monday, 3/6. Lots of \"relations\" with dh for a wekk around time of O. Since early last week I have been feeling very off physically. Lower abdominal cramps that were on for about a day and a half. Now there sporadically. Feeling exhausted, not tired wanna sleep, but drained. If I do anything I feel burnt out. That was last week. Since, my tastes have gotten a little off, the cramps come and go and I feel like dolly parton! My bbs are noticeably \"bigger\", like poppin out of my perfectly fitting cups. Overall I feel absolutely blah, like something is just NOT right. I am 27, came off the pill in nov with everything remaining a perfectly normal cycle, just heavier AF.I am 27, I know my body can suddenly decide to change. I have always had the same 2-3 pms symptons that kick in 2 to 3 days in advance of af. the aforementioned symptoms have NEVER been a pms symptom. Plus why would they start over a week before af was due!! But here's the kicker....you ready...I have had a tubal ligation. I have done my homework and surprisingly learned they are not 100%. I mean I knew that, but WOW I was shocked. Plus they only banded my tubes no cutting burning nothing. Nothing to damage the tubes and make a regrowth with canal harder. Sorry for the long post, I am honestly freaked out here. I know my body well and this \"change\" or whatever it is has really gotten to me.I know many here are ttc, if I end up pregnant it turned out to simply be gods will. Super extra friday dose of baby dust to you all!**********",
