            "answer": "Hmm...sounds like she'll need to be taken to the vet. Diabetes is common in older cats, and it causes what you described although that's a decision the vet should make. It could be determined by performing a glucose test, which isn't expensive at all.Other than that, did you check her leg? Any visible wounds? Is she active? Could the leg be broken?Your best option is to take her to the vet. Please come back with updates, and I hope your kitty is well. Just remember, that if she indeed has diabetes, that this isn't a death sentence. Let us know if you have any questions and we'll gladly try to help you as much as we can.PK.",
