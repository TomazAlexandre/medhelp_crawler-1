            "answer": "Dear teedit,I can certainly understand your anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0When you have a chronic illness like Diabetes, you really do worry about all the things that can go wrong, and of course Kidneys can be a major concern.\u00a0\u00a0I've learned a few things in my 39 years with diabetes and one is that you do have to stay on top of things and pursue the knowledge and answers that you need to help you understand and care for your diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like you are already doing a good job of that.\u00a0\u00a0I have also learned that simply having a symptom doesn't necessarily mean you're doomed for the worst outcome, although I know that feeling.It sounds like your kidneys are probably in good shape based on the tests your doctor has already performed.\u00a0\u00a0However, for your peace of mind and education, you may want to make an appointment with a nephrologist to learn more about your particular syptoms and also to learn more about diabetes and kidney disease in general.\u00a0\u00a0A nephrologist will be able to give you more detailed information about the progression of kidney disease and what symptoms you might be experiencing if you were really in trouble.\u00a0\u00a0At the very least, a nephrologist might be able to set your mind at ease, so that your energies can be spent on taking care of all the other things we diabetics have to do to get through the day.\u00a0\u00a0The bottom line is that good control is the best way to avoid complications and that's hard enough without adding the burden of worrying.\u00a0\u00a0I would encourage you to do whatever will lighten your worry load, so that you can keep up the good work of taking care of yourself.ES",

            "answer": "teedit,Thanks for your post.\u00a0\u00a0I've had diabetes for a long time, too, and am embarrassed to say I never knew that a bit o' foam/froth in our urine can be a symptom of protein.I have had that very occasionally and also have routine kidney function tests that are always normal.\u00a0\u00a0Last time I had that, it was just after some outpatient surgery and I'd assumed it was the result of a more forceful stream.\u00a0\u00a0Your question & the answer now suggest I may've had some ketones during that post-op period.Might there be anything else going on that might account for a temporary change in your urine?\u00a0\u00a0Additional exercise?\u00a0\u00a0Not enuf water this summer?\u00a0\u00a0Doing Atkins or similar high protein diet?Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you'll let us all know what you find out if you do get a more thorough check with a nephrologist.",

    "question": "For the past two years I have been noticing a little more frothing and bubbling in my urine.\u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes it's very noticeable and sometimes it isn't there at all.\u00a0\u00a0Immediatly suspecting the worst I went to my endo and had her run the gamut of Blood and Urine tests on me to check for kidney damage.\u00a0\u00a0My creatine to Albumin ratio came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0However, when I'm convinced something is wrong with me I don't like to hear that I'm ok so I had her redo the test because everything I have ever read indicated that foamy urine is usually protien.\u00a0\u00a0It can back in the low ranges of normal for even a healthy person once again.\u00a0\u00a0All was good and fine thereafter until I noticed that my new pack of ketoacidosis strips that I always get but never use had a proteinuria check on them.\u00a0\u00a0The test came back on the lighter side of trace, but with the foam getting worse in my urine.\u00a0\u00a0I am once again worried.Is it time to make my first visit with a nephro?",
