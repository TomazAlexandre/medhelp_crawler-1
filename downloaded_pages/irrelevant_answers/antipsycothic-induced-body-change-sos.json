            "answer": "The long term effects of (current) antipsychotics include tardive dyskinesia (a permanent movement disorder, for more information google \"Patient Education Tardive Dyskinesia\" note as the site itself says \"some of these medications may be medically necessary\") and diabetes though only a doctor would understand this in full. Antipsychotics also of course cause temporary movement disorders that can be treated with side effect pills that would stop once they are discontinued. Any concerns of that nature are best addressed by a movement disorders specialist. If you have any changes in weight or what appear to be metabolic changes it would probably be best to see a doctor who could do a standard blood tests to rule out any metabolic changes and the potential of diabetes as if caught in time that could be better treated and potentially go into remission. Also they would need to monitor what the medications were prescribed for to begin with as what they were treating once the medication is discontinued will return.",

    "question": "I'm 22. On May 2010 I started assuming psychodrugs under medical control and went on for 4 months (bad love matters..). First month I was given quite a hard terapy, in order to calm me down.. I wasn't in the condition to refuse, and maybe didn't even realize WHAT I was actually introducing in my body..: Ziprexa\u00a0\u00a04117 (olanzapine 10mg) and high doses of haldol (aloperidolo drops) and Ansiolin (diazepam). Plus Akineton (biperiden hydrochloride). Soon I wasn't even able to stand up. ... And among all the other awful effects I experienced abnormal hunger, which along with lack of physical movement, made me put on 10 kilos in a bare month.After three week assumption, I quit Olanzapine. The psychiatrist begins to reduce the drugs doses: this process takes till the end of August. Since then I haven't used drugs any more.Nightmare months.Now.. I went through many side effects.. some of them still remain. I find myself cancelled, both emotionally and physically.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I've returned to my initial weight, but I'm not at all the person I used to be.I feel like an odd little E.T. : extremely thin arms and legs and a beer belly that measures up about 80 cm.I'd always been thin and balanced.The doctor says it's abnormal visceral adipose tissue which makes me look pregnant.Abnormality due to medicines.What What What can I do-take-hope-pray-------------------------?Physical exercise and diet have acted on all the body but paunch.(Please think if you know some medical centre or specialist (surgeon???) who could give me advice.Links, addresses, similar experiences are welcome)Italian little Extra-terrestrial woman.",
