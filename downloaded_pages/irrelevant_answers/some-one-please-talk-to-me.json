            "answer": "I don't know much but I did hear that they only recently found what they think is a link between diabetes and crohns. They think it's because they're both auto-immune diseases? I stumbled across that when I was searching the internet about crohns. I found it interesting because I have a lot of diabetes in my family and now they think I may have crohns. I think this is fairly new knowledge right now and I think they're still learning. They still don't really know what causes crohns. They say it can be heriditary and that certain ethnic groups are more prone (Jewish people) but they still don't know enough about it all.I'm assuming you have diabetes and crohns? The internet is an excellent way to learn about all of this. You might want to also check out CCFA (Crohns and Colitis Foundation of America). Best wishes to you.",

            "answer": "I read the same article, but it was for a link with Type 1 diabetes or Juvenile diabetes, not Type 2.\u00a0\u00a0I have Type 2 diabetes and was diagnosed with it about a month after being diagnosed with Crohn's.\u00a0\u00a0My father has Type 2 and had Ulcerative Colitis also.\u00a0\u00a0It could all be only genetic, but my theory is that my body was under so much stress and poor nutrition from the Crohn's (which I had symptoms of for 5 yrs before being correctly diagnosed) that I developed the diabetes much earlier than usual.\u00a0\u00a0I was probably going to get diabetes at some point, but maybe not until retirement age.\u00a0\u00a0With the Crohn's doing the damage to my body, I think the diabetes was brought on.\u00a0\u00a0Who knows, maybe I am all washed up, but maybe not.",

            "answer": "My younger brother had Crohn's all his life.\u00a0\u00a0I believe there is a link to celiac disease, which I have.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, they sometimes call this leaky gut symdrome also.\u00a0\u00a0The situation in celiac seems to be, that the gut is irritated and lets gluten gliaden proteins leak into the blood stream without being broken down/digested correctly.\u00a0\u00a0The body immune system attacks these stranger proteins and destroys them.\u00a0\u00a0But the problem is the proteins sometimes lodge on an internal organ and the body then gets confused and attacks that organ also.\u00a0\u00a0They can test for celiac by doing blood tests for gliaden antigens.\u00a0\u00a0Gliaden is the protein in wheat gluten.\u00a0\u00a0Anyhow, I have read that researchers found antigens to yeast proteins in Crohn's patients.\u00a0\u00a0That could mean a similar process happens in Crohn's patients and they get autoimmune diseases for the same reason's celiac patients do.\u00a0\u00a0Except it is yeast causing the problem vs wheat or in addition to wheat.\u00a0\u00a0I eat a simple diet of mainly rice and veggies and meats that I cook myself.\u00a0\u00a0That way I control what goes into my body not some big corporate food plant with a chemical factory sitting behind it.\u00a0\u00a0My food doens't come in boxes, it actually looks like food when I buy it, not a printed image on a container.\u00a0\u00a0It's the real thing!\u00a0\u00a0I avoid any processed foods for the most part, although not totally.\u00a0\u00a0I know Crohn's is tough to deal with and I wish you well.\u00a0\u00a0I really think it makes sense to go on a do it yourself cooking plan with limited spices (salt and pepper only), review all the medicines and vitamins you are taking for possible bad ingredients, eliminate soy which is bad for everyone, consider eliminating dairy also.\u00a0\u00a0Many celiac people can't do dairy, soy and nightshades in addition to the wheat, rye and barley that cause the main reactions in celiac.\u00a0\u00a0An elimination diet is a very good start for any GI problems detective work.",
