This pregnancy, sickness started around 6 Weeks, but wasn't no where near as severe with my son. Even my diabetes test at 14 weeks came back better than me not being pregnant. I had an 80% chance of getting hyperemesis again, and it didn't. Every pregnancy is different so don't fret too much! Enjoy not being sick in case it sets in in a few Weeks! Good luck!",
