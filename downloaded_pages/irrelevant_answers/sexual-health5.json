            "answer": "You'll have to ask your doctor for confirmation about any of this, but I can give some advice.First of all, are you sexually active at all?\u00a0\u00a0If you are, what part of your sexual health are you worried about?\u00a0\u00a0Is it expressing your sexuality?\u00a0\u00a0Diseases?\u00a0\u00a0Pregnancy?\u00a0\u00a0We'll be able to tell you more if you tell us more about what you want to know.Please see your doctor about urination problems.\u00a0\u00a0It could be something nasty, or it could be something like weak pelvic floor muscles, in which case kegels would help (they were originally designed for restoring urinary continence).\u00a0\u00a0If it's just a small amount, a pantiliner can help absorb it and keep your underwear clean.\u00a0\u00a0I mean no offense by this, but are you sure it's urine and not discharge?\u00a0\u00a0Vaginal discharge can cause a lot of wetness and can be yellowish, but it smells different from urine.I really doubt you have a diabetes problem based on what you've told us here.\u00a0\u00a0Normal blood sugar levels usually range between 80-120 mg/dL.\u00a0\u00a0If you were actually fasting at the time of the test, the 112 might be worth further testing, but if you didn't do the test first thing in the morning (before eating the first time that day), then 112 isn't worrisome.\u00a0\u00a0A hemoglobin A1C test can tell your doctor what your blood sugar has been like for the past few months.\u00a0\u00a0They can also test your urine for sugar.\u00a0\u00a0If you have certain risk factors for diabetes, your doctor would be more likely to order more tests.I'm making a guess here, but are you worried about diabetes because you've heard it makes you pee a lot?\u00a0\u00a0If so, I personally don't think that's your problem.\u00a0\u00a0Untreated diabetes causes both excessive thirst and excessive urination, but not incontinence.\u00a0\u00a0At a certain point, there is so much extra sugar in your blood that it starts leaking into the urine, which pulls extra water out with it, causing you to pee much more than usual.\u00a0\u00a0Since you're dumping all that water, you get thirsty.\u00a0\u00a0Untreated diabetes also causes weight loss (despite its association with obesity), because your body isn't able to use all the sugar floating around and actually starts having to break down fat to get energy.\u00a0\u00a0This can also lead to increased hunger.Again, we're not medical professionals here, so I urge you to ask your doctor about any doubts you have.Even if you do have diabetes, it doesn't make you sexually weak, although side effects could conceivably create some physical hurdles.\u00a0\u00a0But sexual strength is more a question of whether you and your partner feel happy with what you're doing, and not about what anyone else thinks.@Nohard: While there is some REALLY FREAKING COOL research on capsaicin in diabetes, there's no evidence yet that it helps in humans.\u00a0\u00a0Cayenne pepper is a perfectly nice spice, but too much will cause discomfort at both ends (and the mechanism by which it creates that burning sensation is pretty nifty too).",
