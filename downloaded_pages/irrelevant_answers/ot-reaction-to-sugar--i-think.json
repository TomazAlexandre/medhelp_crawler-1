            "answer": "Ok, nurse here to scold (lightly of course) and this got longer than I wanted, but bear with it, am an old woman digressing and chattering but with your best interest at heart as I hear what you are saying!\u00a0\u00a0I mean no disrespect.Well, I don't think it was the sugar, you certainly didn't eat the whole batch..You only ate ONE.Of course, it sounds like you didn't have much to eat today either!\u00a0\u00a0So perhaps your tummy was telling you it wanted something more nutritious or perhaps a glass of milk to go with it.............I often get this feeling but its because I've put rather rich food on an empty tummy.Fasting blood sugars wouldn't tell you if today's \"sin\" was the cause, that only works to test your system in general or the day they test it.\u00a0\u00a0A1C blood work will work much better.\u00a0\u00a0Blood sugars always depend on what you've had THAT day of the test.\u00a0\u00a0If this were happening on a regular basis and you were EATING , then yes, you would want to consider FBS.I think if it were the ingredients, the reaction would have lasted longer.I had to giggle at your statement that you were eating healthier......I don't think you are eating enough, if all you had today was a pear and a special K bar.If you are concerned about sugar (which is a NATURAL ingredient) you can go to something like Stevia, which is what my husband uses.\u00a0\u00a0I personally don't think sugar in moderation is bad for anyone.\u00a0\u00a0Nutritionists, of course, have their own pet theories.\u00a0\u00a0My doctors have always said whatever you want in moderation......so \"portion control\" in their opinion and I have to agree, is the answer.\u00a0\u00a0This of course depends on your weight which I have not asked about.\u00a0\u00a0I figure you know about that!I was diagnosed 7 yrs ago with NIDDM (type 2 diabetes) and had a hard time with the medications, and my doctors not willing to put me on demand insulin, offered me diet control.My numbers stay in the normal range with portion control.\u00a0\u00a0I routinely check my blood sugar about once a month just in case and always ask for A!C check to be done when they are drawing blood.I am not saying this works for everyone..............far from it........but I also have an aunt who had diabetes and totally denied it (she was overweight) and died from heart failure which the Dr. attributed to her ignoring her numbers.\u00a0\u00a0She felt that if she ignored it, it would go away.\u00a0\u00a0Based on what I know about her, am sure the numbers were quite high.Hope this helps put your mind at ease!\u00a0\u00a0Next time, add a glass of milk with that cookie!Sarah",

            "answer": "My vote is the peanuts. Without a doubt. Momentary high glucose levels do NOT happen with eating cookies. It just doesn't happen unless you are ingesting simple sugars, such as orange juice. You cannot link the fact \"the reaction didn't last longer\" with anything. Interestingly peanuts can become extremely toxic and life-threatening if certain molds grow on them, even if you are not someone who has an allergy to them.",

Two weeks ago\u00a0\u00a0I had a pb & choc donut, not on an empty stomach, and felt fine afterwards.\u00a0\u00a0Now with that information and the fact that I didn't eat much today, I know my comment about my healthier lifestyle sounds suspicious, lol.\u00a0\u00a0I just meant, in comparison to my Type II diabetic relatives who overeat unhealthy foods regularly; are quite obese; don't exercise; and, smoke or used to smoke.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm not nearly that bad, relatively speaking.Feeling ok now, had some leftover Thai chicken and jasmine rice and some tea. I'll document this little episode and mention it at my next GP visit.Thanks also to Sarah for the explanation of the different kinds of blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0That makes a lot of sense.",

Hope today is better.Oh, sorry - one more add regarding the sugar sin, lol. It's the combo of foods that will keep your sugar stable. i.e., if you have a banana have 1/2 of it, and make sure you have 1/2 cup of milk, and some crackers (only a couple) with it!\u00a0\u00a0That will keep your sugar stable. Eating the whole banana (or anything else w/fructose or sugar) along can cause trouble when prone to diabetes. (I had diabetes w/each pregnancy)",
