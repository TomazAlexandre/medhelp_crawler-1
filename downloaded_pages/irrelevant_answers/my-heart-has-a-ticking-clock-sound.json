            "answer": "Well, if this is genuine and not a time wasting hoax, you seriously need to get to the hospital immediately. Why do I say hoax? because the only thing which can produce a clicking sound in the heart is the mechanical valves and you would need a leaflet to be hanging off for such a loud sound, but even then it would be a different sound. According to your sample, your heart rate was in excess of 170 bpm at the start which is ridiculously high unless you had just run a marathon. Also if you had a valve in that condition you would already be in hospital having surgery because you would be near death.",

            "answer": "!!! The same thing happens to me! And it started around when I was 15/16 (I'm 19 now) and its still happening to me. its usually after I move around too much or take a shower, but sometimes it just makes that ticking sound just because! I went to the doctors but Im pretty sure they didnt believe me,, its not like I can make it tick whenever I want. One doctor I saw was actually pretty rude and was very obvious he didnt believe or like me, so after that I decided to not bother anymore, but Im still concerned and curious. If you found out what was wrong or happening I would really like to know, thank you and good luck \u2728",

    "question": "My heart has a ticking clock noise. It gets very loud when my heart is beating very fast. Kind of sounds like it is coming out of my mouth. The ticking clock noise goes with the rhythm of my heart beat. But when I stand straight up it stops. When I lean over my bathroom sink to get closer to my mirror while I am doing my makeup this ticking noise occurs. I have notice it happens when I lean forward. I have no mechanical heart or valve, none of that. My heart has moments where it pounding so hard it hurts. I get chest pains. The right side of my left breast hurts all the time in one spot.\u00a0\u00a0I am 16 years old and am prefectly healthy. No high blood pressure. No diabetes. I Don't do drugs and alcohol.
