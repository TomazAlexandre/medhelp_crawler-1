            "answer": "I think it really depends on what your underlying thyroid trouble is...If you have a chronic disease that is causing the hypothyroid, or if you had simple thyroiditis that initially caused the problem...if it was simple thyroiditis, your body may have recovered and healed itself to the point of not needing the medication, or not needing as much...If it is overactive, the blood test will show a very low TSH and an elevated Free T-4 level...Check out the symptoms of hyperthyroidism...You just never know...Hope this helps!\u00a0\u00a0~MM",

            "answer": "Thanks for your reply, I guess in a way I feel lucky because I don't take a large dose like some people I know and my symptoms through the years have been almost non existant. Just the falling out of the hair (It's thinned but not too badly) and the occasional fuzzyness in my thinking.When I put these questions to my doctor, he said that my dosage must be perfect for me then since I haven't ever put on weight while taking the tablets and my symptoms have been light. It doesn't reassure me tho because they have said the same about my diabetes.. that I am symptomless because they caught me at the very beginning.. Seeing friends with the same two diseases and seeing what problems they have with their weight etc.I know we're all different, and I am thankful that my symptoms in both are light or non existant.. but I'm sure you can see why I'm scheptical about the diagnosis.Thanks for your help. :-)",

            "answer": "Thanks for your reply. Doctors are often very vague when talking about things I don't think they have much of a clue about either.. I don't have the bulging eyes that sometimes comes with Hyperthyroidism, nor the goitre so I don't think that is my problem.\u00a0\u00a0It just seems strange to me that I don't fit into the mold if you know what I mean.Since I have been diagnosed with diabetes they don't seem to be so concerned about the thyroid, it's all about the diabetes.I'll keep monitoring what's going on and keep pestering my doctors I guess, till I get a satisfactory answer.Thanks for your help. :-)",

    "question": "Hi, my first post in this forum and my second on the site.. I hope someone can give me an oppinion.I've had Hypothyroidism for the last 12 years or so I'm told. I take 100mcg of Thyroxine a day. When I was diagnosed I was a little on the heavy side.. but not much. I have never weighed any heavier than 144lbs and I am 5ft 5 ins tall which put me at the top end of my weight according to my height.\u00a0\u00a0The only symptoms I had at the time of diagnosis was an alarming loss of hair and fuzzy thinking. But tests showed I was lacking in Thyroxine.I have in the past 9 months been also diagnosed with Diabetes type 2 but again, not through weight or symptoms but just through urine and blood tests. My weight has plumetted since I found out and stopped eating all the 'nice' stuff..lol. So I now weigh around 123lbs. and I'm still losing weight but trying very hard to stablise it.When I found out I had Diabetes type 2, my doctor reduced my thyroxine from 150 mcg to 100 mcg and this had no ill effects. I'm still scheptical that I really had Thyroid problems in the first place, if I did, how come it can be reduced without symptoms and how come I didn't have the typical symptoms in the first place. Or could my Thyroid have now become overactive since I have no tiredness and bags of energy.?Anyone ever had this query before?Thanks for your oppinions.",
