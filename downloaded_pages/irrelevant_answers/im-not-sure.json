            "answer": "My mom has multiple sclerosis and has similar problems with her hands and feet. She does not have the see-through vein problem though. I have had that problem when I get cold. Just figure it is normal. Unfortunately doctors often want to dismiss a problem no matter how recurrent it may be. If the problem persists, I would recommend seeing a doctor and not give up until they find out what is wrong. Better safe than sorry. Good luck!",

            "answer": "As like clynn's suggestion, DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis) also fits the description. DVT causes the feeling of swellin, a heated pressure and a purplish colour. It is usually found in the legs but can be in the arms aswell and is made worse by over or under exersizing. It doesn't sound like just nothing, I would go see your doctor and get checked out",

            "answer": "I want to thank you all for your help! Now I can go to the doctor armed with enough background to say, HEY I WIL NOT leave without your attention. This morning was the worst that is what caused me to come back here and check the responses. This morning I couldn't get out of my room for a half hour because I couldnt grip the door knob!!!!! Like I said something has always been a little off but I am beginning to think this is a seperate and more important problem. I am one of those people who doesnt want to bother anyone with my troubles, but I have a five year old and he needs me so, ya know. Thanks again!I never thought of diabetes, I think I had that blood work done a while back when I was in my teens because I was passing out, turned out to be migranes! (go figure, migranes in my optical nerve that had NO pain). At any rate, I will visit my doctor after I look up some of these names. Thanks again, you all are so wonderful!!!! If anyone would like to know later I will post what happened later on after I see the doc!",

    "question": "I am not sure what this problem could be, or where to begin to start explaining it. I have always remembered having odd circulation. Also Just so you know, everytime I get my pressure taken its a little low but good enough. I remember being embarassed in gym class as a 12-13 year old because my legs where litterally purplish bluish in colore ( I am caucasion). We used to joke and say I was so white I was see through! ;> Now that I am an adult it is becoming a matter that is not funny at all.When I wake up in the morning it feels as if my hands are so swollen, or full of water that I can not even close them. I try, and I can close them but it hurts, and feels as if my skin is very taunt. When I look at my hands, they don't appear swollen though. I also notice that they feel hot to me and to the touch. Then I grab my water bottle to wet my throat and first of all I pick it up and it drops right out of my \"grasp\", then on top of all of this I almost can'even get the lid off, not because of the \"swelling\" but also because I have less strength for some reason. It seems to let up a little as the day goes on, but it never goes away. I have been feeling this way for about a year now, it has gotten to the point that it bothers me enough to reach out now.As if this wasn't enough, my feet seem to share the same problem. I do not of course try to pick up and grasp things with my feet, but they get burning hot and feel kind of like they fell asleep sometimes, and of course they feel swollen as well. When I first wake up and get out of bed my heels ache so bad I almost want to tip toe. It is almost as if either sleeping, or resting at all makes it worse!I know most people will probably read this and wonder why I just don't go to my doctor, and I know this may sound crazy but... I feel like I need to talk to someone about it to make sure I am not going to bother her (Dr.) with nothing. So I guess my question would be, does anyone have any suggestions as to what it could be? Has anyone ever felt this way? Also any home remidies I can use to try to take care of it myself first. Anything will help! Thank you ahead of time! I hope all is well for everyone, and I also hope that you are all feeling better, or do so soon!",
