            "answer": "I think you are absolutely right there. It seems that the cholesterol problems so prevalent with T2s has more to do with high insulin levels than high blood sugar levels.My control has not been particularly good in the past. But after 28 years of being a T1 diabetic, my lipid profile has never been better and my heart attack risk is extremely low.Cheers,Mark",

    "question": "Hello, I am wondering if dyslipidemia is as much of an issue for type 1 diabetics as it is for type 2's.\u00a0\u00a0The minute I was diagnosed and got the blood glucose controlled, all lipid counts were good.\u00a0\u00a0Type 1 is not a result of \"metabolic syndrome\" and I don't see as much emphasis on statins in the Type 1 forums.Thanks",
