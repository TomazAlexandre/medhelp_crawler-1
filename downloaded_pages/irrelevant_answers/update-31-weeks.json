    "question": "I am 31 weeks today. Had ultrasound because I am always measuring 2 to 3 weeks ahead. Have been since 22 weeks. He is 4.7pnds, 17 inches long, and 79% tile. She is keeping my due date and just calling it large gestational baby and as long as I make it another 5 weeks, she is ok with me having the baby whenever he is ready to come out haha! I do not believe what so ever I will last till November 13th. Definitely going to be an October baby, I can feel it. Felt the same with my daughter and I was right and she was born at 37 weeks :)",
