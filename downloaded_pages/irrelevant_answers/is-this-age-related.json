            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you are easily getting fatigued with accustomed exercise level then hypothyroidism, diabetes, heart problems, high BP and anemia should be ruled out first. If you become tired after unaccustomed exercise, then it could be age related or just that you are not used to exercising and keeping drinks handy after exercise such as lemonade, juices etc will help. It would be good if you could get a complete body checkup, even if you do not have any obvious problem other than this fatigue. Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "I just found this site because I was having the same issue and I'm looking for some answers.\u00a0\u00a0After doing a good work-out ...not even too vigorous, I feel sick the next couple of days - flu-like symptoms. I feel like a total loser because I'm always \"sick\" and when I quit working out, I'm back to normal.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be related to hormones? I noticed that a few people in this post sounded \"older\". I'm 50 years old and this never happened to me when I was younger?What was the final word on the topic? Is it cause by an imbalance of minerals in the body? or it is related to the stomach\u00a0\u00a0bacteria level? I'm a little confusedThis discussion is related to/posts/show/200900.",
