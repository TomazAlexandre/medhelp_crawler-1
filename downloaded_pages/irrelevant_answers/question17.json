Question to you is what have you done regarding what doctornee suggested; \"With a history of sore throat and stiff neck, balance problems, meningitis should be ruled out. Compressed cervical spinal nerves too should be ruled out by MRI. Sleep studies should be done to know the cause behind this altered sleep pattern.\"Your other thread mentioned thyroid imbalance. Suggestions were left. What have you done further with this? What medications are you taking?",
