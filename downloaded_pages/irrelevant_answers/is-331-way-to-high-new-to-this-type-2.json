    "question": "I am a type 2 diabetic for about 3 years. I take metformin. My last blood test at the doctor was too high,(The test that is to show the average blood sugar.) I have not even checked my blood sugar for about a year. I ate no breakfast today. At lunch I had a ham and swiss sandwich. snack one very large peanutbutter cookie. Dinner was a large bowl of potatoe leek soup. I ate the soup around 2 hours ago. My bloodsugar is 331 now. I forgot to take my metformin yesterday and today. I just took it after I checked my sugar. I know I did this all wrong. Should I stay awake and check it in an hour or just go to sleep like I feel like?",
