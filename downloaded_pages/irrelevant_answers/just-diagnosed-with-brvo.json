            "answer": "You need to be under the care of an ophthalmologist. Depending on size and location most branch retinal vein occlusions do not require treatment. It is imporant to rule out cardiovascular disease causing this so you need good physical exam by internist or family doctor with blood work, ekg.If you smoke or are overweight these need to be treated. High cholesteral and high blood pressure are especially important to treat if present.JCH MD",

            "answer": "Branch retinal vein occlusion BRVO should not be caused by thyroid problems. As I mentioned the main risks are smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesteral, diabetes, blood that is abnornally thick and several other rare causes. BRVO is usually less serious than central retinal vein occlusion CRVO. If the BRVO is remove from the macula the prognosis is excellent and often no treatment is necessary other than treat any underlying medical conditions that might cause the condition. Sometimes low dose aspririn is prescribed. For completeness sake I should mention that undiagnosed or poorly controled glaucoma can cause BRVO. Your ophthalmologist would have excluded this by your examination.\u00a0\u00a0In some instances of the macula is involved and vision affected and the problem not resolving laser therapy is used to try and 'dry up\" the retinal.JCH MD",
