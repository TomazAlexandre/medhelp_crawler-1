            "answer": "Dear Anonymous:Sorry to hear about your parasthesias.\u00a0\u00a0Whether alcohol could cause your symptoms is yes.\u00a0\u00a0However, it might be due to a side effect of alcohol, that of reduced nutrition as seen in a low vitamin B12 level.\u00a0\u00a0I would bet, that this more than the alcohol is the reason for your parasthesias (only a guess).\u00a0\u00a0Usually we see alcohol induced parasthsesias in chronic alcohol abuse, which really doesn't sound like you.\u00a0\u00a0The parasthesias can be as you describe but also burning in nature.\u00a0\u00a0Even with a low normal we see vitamin B12 problems of neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0I would talk to your neurologist about vitamin B12 shots/therapy and see if the symptoms do not resolve over time.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

            "answer": "Hi Anonymous,Go to the Mass General Neurology Web forums. Look on the General Neurology or Peripheral Neuropathy forums for posts from Rose.There are specific tests that should be run when the B12 is low normal to determine if there is B12 deficiency due to absorption problems or utilization. Depending on the reason, the treatment is slightly different. She posts references to reliable sources of information.Start taking b12 today even while you wait to see the Dr. If you also take folic acid and are over 50 take 100Mcg B12 which is about 50 times the RDA. From this month's readers digest.Best of luck.",

    "question": "I am a 38 year old woman who has been experiencing the \"symptoms\" of peripheral neuropathy ( Tingling, numbness in hands and feet, odd parathesias, etc) for almost a year. I have been thoroughly tested for MS,PN and ALS( brain and cervical MRI's, evoked potentilas, EMG, nerve conduction, etc) plus blood work - lupus, Sjorgrens, arthritis, etc. All were normal. It recently occurred to me that\u00a0\u00a0I have slipped into a pattern over the past few years of having 2 1/2 to 3 glasses of wine every evening while preparing dinner . Since I have never considered myself having a drinking problem, it never occurred to me that this amount of drinking could be having a toxic effect on my nerves. ( I am 5' 3\" tall and weigh 112 lb.). Do you have any information on how much drinking could casue PN?I am cutting way down, but if my problems are due to alcohol, is the damage permanent? Also, my b-12 was on the very low normal side.Any info would be greatly appreciated.",
