            "answer": "With the symptoms that you present and feel better when you eat something, then this is very typical of hypoglycaemia.Make sure that you eat regularly.\u00a0\u00a0Rather than sugary foods which will give you a high sugar rush, your blood sugars will also drop quickly.Eat foods that are slow release energy foods, like porridge, nuts, brown bread, fruit like an apple with skin on, meat, cheese, fish, yogurt, and so on.Keep refined and sugary foods to a minimum or cut them out and stick to a healthy and well balanced diet with fruit and vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0Cut out or cut down on fizzy drinks.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure that you have a healthy snack in between meal times to keep your sugar levels stable so that they do not drop so low to make you feel ill.\u00a0\u00a0Also make sure that you drink plenty of water so that you do not become dehydrated.Rather than a ACTH test, the HbA1C blood test would have shown the average sugar levels over a 3 month period and having a glucose test may have indicated that you may be pre diabetic.With a glucose test, your blood is taken when you have fasted for over 8 hours.\u00a0\u00a0You are given a glucose drink and then the blood is taken again after a while and examined again.\u00a0\u00a0A reading of 6.3 is indicative of glucose intolerance (pre diabetes).\u00a0\u00a0A blood test reading 6.9 and above indicates that you have diabetes.Hope this helps.",
