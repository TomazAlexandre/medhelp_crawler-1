            "answer": "Hi sherry.You sound like you are having a really rough time .I would definately say you need your thyroid checked. this is a simple blood test.Your symptoms sound like an overactive thyroid.Believe me this condition can cause all the symptoms you are experiencing now.Get your doctor to do a full thyroid profile.Glad your being checked for diabetes too, because that can also give you he symptoms you are suffering with now,Your doctor could check for diabetes and thyroid at the same time.Good luckNicola",

            "answer": "Thank you everyone. My blood test results for diabetes get back to me next week. I asked if i could be tested for Thyroid but nurse said I would have to book another blood test (that she could only do what my doctor asked for). Will ask to have this done soon.I had dieted on and off, but still eating well so not sure about that. it could be anything. i think once I get the MRi scan out of the way (and no bad news) I will feel better. Perhaps I am having severe panic attacks as I have suffered\u00a0\u00a0from anxiety in the past - but I thought I had cured this! I used the Linden method and it was excellent.I will keep you posted and thank you for all your concern and help from the bottom of my heart.Sherry",

            "answer": "Hi Sherry,As has already been said you should just be able to ask your doctor for a Thyroid Function test or TFT test as it often shows up on the blood test form.Hopefully your MRi scan comes back clear and you get the answers to what is causing you to feel so rough soon, to ease up on the stress a bit.Keep us posted and good luck with it allSquidge",

    "question": "Hi everyone,I'm really hoping someone can shed some light on what's happening to me because my doctor's seem slightly clueless.I'm a 32 year old lady. For the past two months or so I have been feeling really faint and dizzy. I work in front of a computer all day and wear glasses (apparently slightly weak as my optician has informed me but don't want to change them as I think they're strong enough!) and my dizzy spells make me feel like I'm going to faint but I don't. As soon as I get this my right hand feels shaky, I feel my eyesight is slightly out of focus and my heart starts racing. It's such a scary sensation and it doesn't seem to go away. I am booked in for an MRi scan next week. My blood tests came back normal but will be tested for Diabetes tomorrow morning. I had to come back from Marrakesh a couple of days early as the heat made everything worse - I was shaky, feeling faint, buzzing headache, vomiting, dizzy, heart palpitations and slightly blurred vision. So scary I just felt like I was going to die from my head exploding!! I feel faint a lot, but always try and stop myself from passing out. No one knows what's wrong with me? All of my friends and family are very worried about me.Anyway, possibilites I feel may be happening - glasses too weak so eyes strained causing headaches and nausea? (Doctor thinks it's doubtful glasses would cause this) Diabetes? (Runs in family) Severe migraines? (I have been given sumatriptan pills for migraines, tried one yesterday and it didn't make that much of a difference).I just want to get my life back to normal. I have a date tonight and I'm too scared to go in case I faint on him and freak him out! :) I want my life back. Please help meMany thanksSherry",
