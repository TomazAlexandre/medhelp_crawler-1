            "answer": "Please see a doctor quickly. Those syptoms your having sound very serious and could be heart related. I also had some middle chest pain and neck and sholder pain. Went to the ER and it turned out to be just anxiety attacks. The point is it could be something not so serious or it could be life threating. Either way you don't know, so it always best to get checked out. Wishing you luck ;)",
