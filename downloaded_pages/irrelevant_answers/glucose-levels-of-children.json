            "answer": "HI,I think you should definitely have your son see his pediatrician as soon as possible. Some of the glucose levels you quoted are in diabetes range but will need to be confirmed by formal testing.\u00a0\u00a0Not all numbers need to be high for it to be abnormal.Keep your son well hydrated with water but he needs to be evaluated soon. If it is diabetes, he will need to start treatment to avid becoming very ill.If not diabetes but somewhere in between(pre-diabetes) his doctor will make some other recommendations.In the meantime, avoid sodas, sweets, fruit juices and cakes etc .Take care",

            "answer": "I am sure the doctor will get back to you, but you really have to make sure and show this to your child's doctor. I have learned that the blood sugars he is having are not normal and he needs to be seen tomorrow. He needs the follow up testing asap and needs an A1C test. This shows the average blood sugar over the last few months. It showed my daughter to have a glucose intolerance. Good Luck. BeckyThis is on the american diabetes association website.With the FPG test, a fasting blood glucose level between 100 and 125 mg/dl signals pre-diabetes. A person with a fasting blood glucose level of 126 mg/dl or higher has diabetes.This is on one of the government websitesTable 1. Fasting Plasma Glucose TestPlasma Glucose Result (mg/dL) \tDiagnosis99 and below \tNormal100 to 125 \tPre-diabetes(impaired fasting glucose)126 and above \tDiabetes*\u00a0\u00a0*Confirmed by repeating the test on a different day.This was on www.endocrineweb.com/diabetes[1]\u00a0\u00a0Fasting Blood Glucose (Blood Sugar) Level:The \"gold standard\" for diagnosing diabetes is an elevated blood sugar level after an overnight fast (not eating anything after midnight). A value above 140 mg/dl on at least two occasions typically means a person has diabetes. Normal people have fasting sugar levels that generally run between 70-110 mg/dl.[2]\u00a0\u00a0The Oral Glucose Tolerance TestAn oral glucose tolerance test is one that can be performed in a doctor's office or a lab. The person being tested starts the test in a fasting state (having no food or drink except water for at least 10 hours but not greater than 16 hours). An initial blood sugar is drawn and then the person is given a \"glucola\" bottle with a high amount of sugar in it (75 grams of glucose), (or 100 grams for pregnant women). The person then has their blood tested again 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours and 3 hours after drinking the high glucose drink.For the test to give reliable results, you must be in good health (not have any other illnesses, not even a cold). Also, you should be normally active (for example, not lying down or confined to a bed like a patient in a hospital) and taking no medicines that could affect your blood glucose. The morning of the test, you should not smoke or drink coffee. During the test, you need to lie or sit quietly.The oral glucose tolerance test is conducted by measuring blood glucose levels five times over a period of 3 hours.\u00a0\u00a0In a person without diabetes, the glucose levels in the blood rise following drinking the glucose drink, but then then fall quickly back to normal (because insulin is produced in response to the glucose, and the insulin has a normal effect of lowing blood glucose.)\u00a0\u00a0In a diabetic, glucose levels rise higher than normal after drinking the glucose drink and come down to normal levels much slower (insulin is either not produced, or it is produced but the cells of the body do not respond to it) (see details on type 1 and type 2\u00a0\u00a0diabetes for more information on this topic).As with fasting or random blood glucose tests, a markedly abnormal oral glucose tolerance test is diagnostic of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 However, blood glucose measurements during the oral glucose tolerance test can vary somewhat. For this reason, if the test shows that you have mildly elevated blood glucose levels, the doctor may run the test again to make sure the diagnosis is correct.Glucose tolerance tests may lead to one of the following diagnoses:Normal ResponseA person is said to have a normal response when the 2-hour glucose level is less than or equal to 110 mg/dl.Impaired Fasting GlucoseWhen a person has a fasting glucose equal to or greater than 110 and less than 126 mg/dl, they are said to have impaired fasting glucose. This is considered a risk factor for future diabetes, and will likely trigger another test in the future, but by itself, does not make the diagnosis of diabetes.Impaired Glucose ToleranceA person is said to have impaired glucose tolerance when the 2-hour glucose results from the oral glucose tolerance test are greater than or equal to 140 but less than 200 mg/dl.\u00a0\u00a0This is also considered a risk factor for future diabetes. There has recently been discussion about lowering the upper value to 180 mg/dl to diagnose more mild diabetes to allow earlier intervention and hopefully prevention of diabetic complications.DiabetesA person has diabetes when oral glucose tolerance tests show that the blood glucose level at 2 hours is equal to or more than 200 mg/dl.\u00a0\u00a0This must be confirmed by a second test (any of the three) on another day. There has recently been discussion about lowering the upper value to 180 mg/dl to diagnose more people with mild diabetes to allow earlier intervention and hopefully prevention of diabetic complications.Gestational DiabetesA woman has gestational diabetes when she is pregnant and has any two of the following: a fasting plasma glucose of more than 105 mg/dl, a 1-hour glucose level of more than 190 mg/dl, a 2-hour glucose level of more than 165 mg/dl, or a 3-hour glucose level of more than 145 mg/dl.",
