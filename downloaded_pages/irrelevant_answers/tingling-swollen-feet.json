    "question": "I am a 62 year old male. I weighed 260 when the hip was replaced and now weigh 330.I had a hip replacement 5 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0Everything was healing well for 6 months then my left foot began to swell up.I had a blood clot in my left inner thigh. I was on cumanin\u00a0\u00a0for 6 mo. with no control for the swelling.\u00a0\u00a0Was told compression hose would have to be worn from then on.\u00a0\u00a0Two years later my right let began to swell also. I take furosemiide40mg (water pill) i daily and wear 30-40 compression stockings on both feet. If I keep the stockings on 24 hrs the swelling is reduced to the point my shoes fit.The question .. I can understand the weight and body mass(large belly) causing the swelling of my legs and feet from the knees down but would that also cause tingling, pain and numbness in my feet??",
