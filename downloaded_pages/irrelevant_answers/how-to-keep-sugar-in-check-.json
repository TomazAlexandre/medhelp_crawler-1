            "answer": "7.4 is actually a good number to be at......do you drink any sodas?\u00a0\u00a0those will raise the numbers as well as the types of fruits and vegetables you eat......while fresh fruits are usally high in sugar they are better than any fruit that is canned or in a container at all......ask your ob for a list of suggested fruits and vegetables for a woman with gestational diabetes.....mine gave me one....things like lettuce, cucumbers, green apples vs red apples, mushrooms, and celery have basically no sugar content and are considered favorable during pregnancy.....also avoid fruits during the morning hours, for some reason they are harder for the body to digest and convert (I know that sounds weird but both my gp and ob/gyn told me that, and i found the same information on a gestational diabetes website).Really though ask your doctor for information about eating right for gestational diabetes, mine gave me a great handout, and it really brought my sugar levels to reasonable numbers ( I am a type 2 diabetic anyway, but the concern was really high with the pregnancy....)Best of luck.....",

            "answer": "Thank you all for your comments.Teachnz: No I don't drink sodas or canned fruits. I don't usually like sweets and I am one of those people who would always skip dessert.Thanks for the tip on Green Apples vs Red apples. Never heard of that before.I think my case is more hereditary cos my mom is diabetic. I will make sure to ask the doctor for a diet plan at my next visit. I really want to keep this under control and to avoid having GD :(",

            "answer": "Fruit juice also has sugar. Drink lots of water, eat high fibre food. Your digestive system is slower so if you have any treats - avoid them or keep to a bare minimum a day before the glucose test.\u00a0\u00a0 I had a test that came out borderline - could have been the cheesecake and brownie fest I partook in the day before.... I had to take it again a few weeks later and this time avoided juices, anything sweet -\u00a0\u00a0results were normal.",

My 1st test was barely abnormal but I have never been through this with my other 2 other girls. Since then I have really cut back on sweets but I didnt eat many sweets before I was pregnant. But I quit smoking and I started craving sweets instantly. I dont know Im a hot mess right now but I now recognize my weaknesses and I am starting to fix them.

            "answer": "I had gestational diabetes. Everyone metabolizes sugar differently, so what triggers a rise in your sugar could be different than someone else. It's not necessarily sugar itself that raised blood sugar. For example, I could eat cotton candy (as I did at a couple of baseball games) but my sugar didn't go up too much. But if I ate spaghetti, my sugar was off the charts! So, I discovered that carbs are what raised my sugar. Certain fruits were worse than others (bananas were the worst - which I LOVE). Some vegetables - like carrots - raised my sugar. If you can get your doctor to give you a glucose monitor, it's easy to figure out what works for you and what doesn't. Just check your sugar about an hour after you eat something and you'll start noticing patterns. Oh yeah...and milk raises sugar, too.",

    "question": "Hi ladies,I got the results of my 01hr Glucose Tolerence Test. It is now at 7.4. Any thing higher than 7.8 is considered diabetic.I don't know why my sugar is high cos I hardly take sugar (except for the bowl of ice cream may be once in 2wks)My only guilty pleasure has been white rice which I have now switched to brown rice instead. We eat pretty healthy too with lots of fruits and veggies.I am now 28wks and really would love to keep the Sugar in check for the next couple months so that it will not creep up beyond 7.8 mark.Any suggestions/experiences/tips that you could share about this would be greatly appreciated!!!Thank you ladies!!!",
