I passed mine ont my first pregnancy\u00a0\u00a0and ended up having gestational diabetes. My son was 10lbs 11oz and was in the NICU for 5weeks. He is 13 now but he has moderate to severe hearing loss and cerebral palsy. I don't want to scare you, but It's important to be careful with that stuff.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and I hope you don't have to complications. Just be sure to take care of yourself.",

Sorrry for the confusion, it's just the end part it can be hard without snacking. I know ppl have done it before and will do it after me.\u00a0\u00a0Just felt whiny.Hopefully the next test will be negative. Maybe this will motivate me to fit in some exercise somewhere. :)",

    "question": "I'm 24 weeks, failed my 1 hour glucose by 1 point. 1 point!!!! I know a line in the sand is needed for a screening test but that 1 point means that I have to be NPO at midnight on a 24 hour in house call shift. After 18 hours on my feet I really need food, nuts, gum to stay awake and running for the rest 6 -8 hours left in that 24.Yes I know ppl have it worse and I have worked longer then that with no naps too. It just that I was able to eat though.I wish I wasn't feeling so whiny.",
