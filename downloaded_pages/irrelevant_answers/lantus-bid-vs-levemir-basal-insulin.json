            "answer": "Hi,If this low dose of lantus twice daily is working for you without any problems, there is no reason to change it. Lantus is written as once daily but many doctors(including myself) and patients split the dose because even though it is supposed to be \"peakless\", it is not for some people. At low doses it works especially well as a split dose. Levemir can be used instead, and is more commonly written as twice daily. But at the doses you are taking there is likely no real benefit of one over the other.Glad to hear your BS have evened out a bit. It is tough when you are watching those carbs and trying to spread them out, but I am sure you are quite good at it given this is a major basis of CF care(I had alot of experience with CF diabetes during my training in the Bay area).Glad the SSRI info was helpful.take care!",

I am interested.",

    "question": "When I started using 2u Lantus in morning, 2 weeks ago, I'd go low in the late afternoon/early evening, and then my morning sugars would be elevated ... 140s, 150s.\u00a0\u00a0So I split the dose:\u00a0\u00a0I'm now using 1.5u Lantus AM & 1u Lantus PM.\u00a0\u00a0It definitely works better than 2u QD, and I've checked the middle of the night - not a problem.\u00a0\u00a0The drug sheet for Lantus doesn't mention BID dosing, but my internet articles do.\u00a0\u00a0What are your thoughts, and is Levemir better for BID dosing?Over the last 2 weeks, my average BS - many sticks - is 121.\u00a0\u00a0I'm happy with that, although I'd still like to even them out.\u00a0\u00a0Eating out makes it difficult when I'm estimating carb content.BTW, thank you for information on SSRIs & blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0My tx pulmonologist believes lexapro should have a Black box warning re causing diabetes - although he doesn't believe anyone should use anti-depressants.\u00a0\u00a0My prograf depression was not 'sadness' so much, but stupid, consistent impulses ... like wrecking my car.\u00a0\u00a0Odd, but persistent over years before I tried trazodone, then lexapro.\u00a0\u00a0Trazodone still helps me sleep, PRN.\u00a0\u00a0I like it bec it's not addictive or anti-chlorinergic.",
