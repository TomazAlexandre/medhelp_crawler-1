            "answer": "Hi,In general, carbohydrates as a group will raise blood sugars but the more complex types(like beans) will do it more slowly than simple sugars(like juices). Splenda seems to be a good choice as a sweetener, so you may give that a try. The American Diabetes Association website has some good information about food choices and meal planning that should help with lists of good options. Good luck!",

            "answer": "Hey... about the artificial sweeteners, I hear you... I don't have IBS, but they definitely cause \"issues\" for my GI tract.\u00a0\u00a0I found Stevia... it's a naturally sweet plant extract that has no carbs.\u00a0\u00a0A lot of folks don't like it because it can have a bitter after-taste, but I don't think it's any worse than the chemical artifical sweeteners.There are a number of good websites out there (try searching for \"diabetic diet\"... but it *does* take time to filter through the ones that just want to sell stuff)... The ADA website is an OK place to start, too.Especially with IBS, try seeing a nutritionist as they can be really, really great with helping find foods and meals that work for you.",

    "question": "Even though I have read some books and articles in mags, I still don't fully understand how or what to eat. I don't really get it about carbos-good or bad. I rarely eat anything with sugar in it and artificial sweeteners play havok with my IBS. Can you help me to simplify?",
