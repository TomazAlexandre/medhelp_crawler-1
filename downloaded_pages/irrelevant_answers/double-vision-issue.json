            "answer": "RedObsidian, I was wondering if your double vision is with like full objects, example a can of coke ect. I think I'm experiencing double vision but it's only on bright surfaces with a black background, such as white text on black background. Also when looking at the moon I see like half of the moon underneath it.With the text if i sit right up close to my monitor, say 1-2inches from it the double vision of the text disappears, i have a history of short sightedness in my family so I think it might be that, though it only happens on bright objects illuminating off dark surfaces. Could you please explain what you are seeing?",
