            "answer": "If you have had an exposure significant enough to warrant PEP you should have been under the care of an HIV specialist. They would have advised you on post PEP testing. The testing protocol (per BASHH) recommends a follow up test at 6months. What did the clinician say?Your state in your thread in the Lymphoma forum you had swollen glands from 6 months ago, while your UPSI was 4 months ago so the chances are it is not HIV causing your swollen nodes.Diabetes does not have an effect on seroconversion time. PEP slows down viral replication so can have an effect on seroconversion time.Are you a diagnosed Diabetic, with type 1 or 2?It's pointless trying to determine if you have HIV from symptoms. The addition of PEP into the equation, pre-existing lymphatic symptoms and Diabetes (if you really are diuabetic) makes guesswork all the more futile.You need to test to know. Contact the clinic who arranged the PEP and seek their expert advice.",

How immature. Reported.Observational data are limited, but in ten years of application of the 'three months rule' by all members of the UK HIV Laboratory Forum no reports of its failure have been received, and thus it is recommended that in general the three month rule continues to be applied\u00a0\u00a0Patients may be infectious to others during this period and should be advised of this. In cases where post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is given a 6 month follow-up test is recommended due to the fact that antiretrovirals may reduce replication and prolong antibody response.",

    "question": "Dear Doctor,What a great site.Can you PLEASE help me with some advice. I had receptive anal sex in May and the condom broke.The lad said he was ok and had but I don't know him well and maybe he did not know himslf.\u00a0\u00a0I am always careful and use condoms. The next day (within 12 hours) I took PEP for 4 weeks. The glands in my groin area had been swollen for months prior to the encounter. On the second week after taking PEP my glands under my arms and to the sides and behind my neck, under my collar bone and above my elbows swelled up, confirmed by my doctor. I had a baseline ELISA test which was negatve, a test at 3 months post exposure which was negative and 4 months post exposure which was negative. After 8 weeks my blood sugars were very high, I also had trembling feelings. My glands are still swollen and I occasionally have drenching night sweats. At 3 months I got a rash of red spots on my back. Now I have a rash on my forehead, diorhea, swollen glands and my genitals keep going bright red and leaving sores. I have had a urine test and no UTI. Since my negative test after PEP at 4 months post exposure, and negative at 4 months for all other STDs, could this be late ARS for HIV? Could be diabetic cause late seroconversion? Could PEP cause seroconvesion this late? I have no other ideas for my symptoms but my doctor wants to take a lymph node biopsy.Thank you.",
