            "answer": "These words of wisdom are nothing more than common sense. Every one of you have the ability to use that sense but only if you want to. We have this habit of turning our eyes away from what we know is right because it interferes with our scheme of things. When we feel that the time has come to start on the road to recovery we all of a sudden begin to think and, in thinking, begin to apply common sense and logic to the matter at hand. It is a case of your body against your mind. When the tug of war begins between the two you start to think about how you are going to conquer the addiction. That is when you truly begin to apply your mind to the problem. You pit your mind against the pull of your body and it's request for more chemical substance. Then the question arises as to which is stronger, your mind or your body. Once you realize that it is you who truly decides, then you have taken a giant step forward. Your body can't live without you finding sustenance, clothing, shelter etc. etc. etc. This requires you to think as to how you can acquire these things. It all comes down to using your head to do what needs to be done in order to exist. This applies to defeating the demons that are controlling you. Set your mind to the fact that you are stronger than that little pill and despite the pull of your body you are in control, not it.Once you realize that you have something inside of you, an inner strength that you have been ignoring, you will\u00a0\u00a0go even further than that giant step and be well on your way to recovery. Don't do it for me. Don't do it for the other guy, Do it for you.",

    "question": "I just recently found out, to add to all my other problems, that I now have type 2 diabetes. My wife says I am a walking disaster and a medical wonder considering that I still look like I'm as healthy as a horse. Nothing you can do but live with it as best you can. I've got 83 years under my belt and in spite of the maladies, intend to be around for a while yet. This is why I was able to beat oxycontin. If you continue to look at the dour side of things you will stay in the darkest part of any problem. If you want to beat something you have to be upbeat about it and go at it with a fervor that says, \"I'm coming and nothing can stop me.\"\u00a0\u00a0All too often someone quits one step too soon and are right back at the beginning. If I had given up with all that has happened to me, I would have been laid in my resting place a long time ago. As it is here I am large as life and ten times as feisty. You cannot give up no matter what. Once you make a decision to beat whatever problems beset you, you have to give it your all. Every minute has to be centered on the finish and what it can mean to you and those who love you. For them to see the new you and for you to see the great smiles from others who care is, in itself, well worth the journey. If you are going to do it, do it with every fiber of your soul and once started give it all you can no matter what befalls you on the journey. Many have fallen and given up. Many more have fallen, risen to their feet and continued on again, and again and again. It's time to see who you really are and just how much you want it and just how much you are willing to sacrifice to become once again the person who somehow made a wrong turn and wants to rectify that mistake.",
