            "answer": "We see placentas with some calcifications all the time.Generally it is most commonly seen with post date gestation, but occasionally it is noted earlier.\u00a0\u00a0It can sometimes be seen with a chronic disease such as mild hypertension of pregnancy, diabetes, or even a low grade, subclinical infection.Sometimes it appears in the absence of any problem.\u00a0\u00a0Rarely do placenta calcifications cause any problem--the fact that they were seen and your sister had to have an emergency C/S at 7 months may not be related at all, unless the calcifications were noted as extensive on the pathology report.I don't believe it has anything to do with risk factors for heart disease at all.\u00a0\u00a0You are wise to continue with being a nonsmoker, exercising, and following a good diet.",

            "answer": "We lost out third son at 31 weeks, and the doctor said his placenta was calcified, looking like that of a full term baby's. I AM NOT a smoker, and eat pretty healthy during my pregnancies, though I am preeclamptic with them all. Any clue as to what may have caused this? Could it have been the toxemia? the day he died, my BP was high and I was severly swollen in my face, hands, and feet, and was having severe migraine headaches.",
