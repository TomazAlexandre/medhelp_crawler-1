            "answer": "I had my daughter at exactly 37 weeks. My water broke at 36 and 5 days so they induced me due to risk of infection. It took 44 hours for her to come. She was 5 pounds 12 ounces. Did everything a full term baby would do. We went home the next day. She did have a little bit of jaundice so we had to take her every few days to monitor her levels but she was just fine :-)",
