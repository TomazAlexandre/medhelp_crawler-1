            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!What you have is transient ischemic attacks or TIA. TIA or transient ischemic attack is a mini stroke that happens when the blood supply to brain is temporarily cut off. The episodes last for a maximum of 24 hours and then resolve or a new symptom starts. Again this can be due to low oxygen supply to brain where the blood supply to brain is temporarily cut off generally due to a spasm of the arteries, or a clot or high blood pressure causing micro leaks in the brain. This can be ruled out by a CT scan or MRI. To diagnose a TIA or mini stroke you need to have a MRI close to the episode. Try to visit an ER for a MRI within a short period of this episode. The symptoms include temporary loss of sensation in any part of the body, black outs, vision loss, tingling, loss of function of a limb etc. It is common in people with high blood pressure, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and high cholesterol. If TIA is suspected then all predisposing factors to TIA should be ruled out like polycythemia vera, sickle cell disease, diabetes, hyperviscosity syndromes, hypertension etc. Generally this can happen several times before an actual stroke happens. This is a warning sign for the body. If you have such episodes, then you must get them evaluated immediately.Otherwise it could be due to nerve compression very high up in the cervical vertebra. Please consult a neurologist. You may need to undergo MRI of the brain or cervical spine.Hope this helps. Take care!",
