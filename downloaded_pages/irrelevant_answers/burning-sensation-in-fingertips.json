            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for your question. Burning sensation in the fingertips can occur due to several possible causes like multi-vitamin deficiencies ( esp. Vitamin B complex deficiencies), carpal tunnel syndrome( esp. if you are a left hander and frequently working on computer of with pen), diabetes( diabetic neuropathy),pinched nerves, Reynaud's phenomenon( burning sensation esp. triggered upon exposure to cold etc) or inflammation due to any recent injury to elbow or hand in general etc. You should consult a doctor who can rule out these general causes and refer you to an orthopedician or neurologist accordingly. Until then multi-vitamin rich and nutritious diet and hand exercises may help relieve pain. Hope this helps.",
