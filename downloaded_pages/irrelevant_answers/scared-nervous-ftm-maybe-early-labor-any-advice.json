    "question": "So since about midnight id say i have felt a few rounds of some low pelvic pressure and some mild cramping. Its now 3am. I was told friday that i was 1cm dilated and 80% effaced, and she did a membrane sweep. I am sooo nervous. I havent been nervous at all until probably friday when the doctor told me he could be here any day now, and everyday since i have just thought, wow. Life is starting now. Things are going to be soo different. Its scary. Im excited but god the actual labor part is freakin me out. Especially now that i am feeling these aches and pains. Ive been hoping (along with my doc) that i go into labor on my own without being induced. But i am being induced on monday if hes not here by then because of gestational diabetes and a blood disorder. I will be 39w monday. I am trying to just keep myself calm and know that i got this, i can do it, everything will be fine.. But man.. I am still scared and nervous.. Idk how i am going to Get sleep.. :/",
