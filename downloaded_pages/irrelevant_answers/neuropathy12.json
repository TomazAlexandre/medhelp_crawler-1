            "answer": "I'd be interested, as well, to read anything that shows HCV has any relation to PN. Mine didn't manifest until several years after I cleared the virus and seems to be related to a B vitamin deficiency and diabetes/insulin resistance. Unless you link PN to metabolic syndrome and diabetes, I haven't heard of a link.Clearing the virus, however, is a good thing in itself.",

            "answer": "Wow I am really sorry to hear this given your husband is doing good what with being UND in week four and shaking the rash and all.In what manner is your husband's PN worsening compared to prior to treatment and baseline? Is the doctor who diagnosed your husband with PN in the loop with his treatment?I only know what I read in the HCVAdvocate about PN & extrahepatic manifestations. I encourage you to contact his Neurologist or the the doctor who determined HCV was related to his PN in the first place. There has to be a way to manage his symptoms. The handout has an array of suggestions to manage them. Was he doing any of the things mentioned in the link prior to treatment?Here is the link:http://www.hcvadvocate.org/hepatitis/factsheets_pdf/PN.pdfI did not confer with my Neurologist very much during treatment in fact I felt like my Raynaud's worsened. The long short is that there were some other factors but eventually around week 30 or so the symptoms began to subside when triggered. To my surprise it has remained at bay and did not respond when triggered in a clinical setting.The thing is I would never had known that if I did not seek advise from a specialist in that arena. It was a hassle and I felt like a hypochondriac all these years but there has to be an answer or a way this can work. That is why I think your hubby might benefit from the input of a Hepa or another doctor qualified to hopefully manage his symptoms and give treatment a chance to work.",

Here are two article about extrahepatic manifestations of Hep CV:http://www.hcvadvocate.org/hepatitis/factsheets_pdf/Extrahepatic.pdfI cannot copy and paste that article but it does say that in one study 15.3% of people with HCV were found to have Peripheral Neuropathy and that the treatment is to treat the underlying cause (HCV).http://www.hcvadvocate.org/hcsp/articles/Bonkovsky-2.html\"Cryoglobulins also affect the nervous system in some HCV infected patients.
