    "question": "So I'm 33 weeks and last night while I was sleeping, anytime I rolled onto my left side I'd be fine for a few minutes and then I'd start getting these horrible cramps in my right side. They were in the same area where you'd get period cramps. Has anyone else experienced this? I feel fine now, it was only while laying on my left side last night. I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night but that didn't seem to help any. Also I don't know if this has anything to do with it but I was told a few days ago I have gestational diabetes (I have a doctors appointment to get a treatment started tomorrow) I'm not super concerned about this but it was incredibly painful so if anyone knows what happened or how to handle it please let me know!",
