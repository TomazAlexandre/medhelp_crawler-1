            "answer": "Hi,I know that suffering from recurrent UTI\u2019s is really very painful. In males, as you know UTI\u2019s are quite rare but unfortunately once the males get the UTI\u2019s, they become difficult to treat. Important things to be ruled out for recurrent UTI\u2019s in a male are :-1.\tDiabetes2.\tAny urinary obstruction commonly due to stones/strictures3.\tAny congenital abnormality in the urinary tract4.\tChronic prostatitisHe should definitely see a urologist and will need further tests to rule out these possibilities. For e.g. an USG of the kidneys,ureters and bladder, IVU etc.I sincerely hope that helps. Please do keep me posted. Warm regards.",

    "question": "Hi, my boyfriends' twin brother has recently had two recurring UTIs.The first one was a few years ago which was so bad he began to hallucinate. he had no problems until about a month ago and it began again, got antibiotics and it went away. then a month later (last week) he got it again and the antibiotics he got began to work but a day after he finished the treatment it came back really bad. He has made an appointment to see his GP and get a referral to a urologist, but as i am a student nurse interested in things like this, im curious to find out what the causes could be.Ive searched online to find out but there isnt much on young men getting recurring utis because its so rare.I will mention that he also has IBS, but has medication for that and eats a diet that reduces an attack of it. He eats healthily and showers daily.I know he is worrying about it and doesnt know why he's getting these so it would be nice if anyone could give us any info.Thanks",
