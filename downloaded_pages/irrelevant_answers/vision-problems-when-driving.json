I also have night blindness....I was diagnosed with cataracts three years ago,\u00a0\u00a0they grew pretty fast and had new lens put in a few months ago...I was told the Diabetes could have caused the fast growth and that the cataracts could also be the cause of my night driving problems...I don't know since I haven't driven at night since the surgery. If I were you I would go and have a complete eye exam....Are you getting your retinas checked at least yearly...very important for Diabetics:).",

    "question": "I am 41 and was diagnosed almost three yrs ago with Type II Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0While i am being treated for this, it has been quite difficult to get my blood sugars under control.\u00a0\u00a0I have glasses because of nearsightedness, but honestly I do not wear them any longer due to the tremendous headaches they now casue me.\u00a0\u00a0I put them on and after an hour, my head is pounding so badly I am grabbing my migraine medicine to help me through it.For the last almost year, I have been having great difficulty driving at night.\u00a0\u00a0The oncoming headlights, the headlights in my rearview mirror and sometimes just traffic lights and parking lot lights cause pain in my eyes and literally blinds me until the light passes.\u00a0\u00a0Two nights ago I had to \"soft crash\" into the wooded area along a dark road because the oncoming headlights from a vehicle blinded me and I could not see the lines of the road.\u00a0\u00a0This has now scared me so much I refuse to drive.\u00a0\u00a0Does my diabetes have anything to do with this problem?\u00a0\u00a0I have attempted to use my glasses when I drive but that has not given me any relief, just gives me another headache.\u00a0\u00a0I realize that I must make an appt with my dr, but I am just concerned if this is serious enough to where I will not be able to drive at night?Thank you for reading my post and have a great day.",
