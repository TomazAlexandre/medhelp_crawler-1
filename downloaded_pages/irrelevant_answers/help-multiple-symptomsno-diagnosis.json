            "answer": "Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency) is a likely diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Addison's disease is a rare condition (1 in 100 000) where theadrenal glands gradually are destroyed. Addison's disease is when the adrenal glands don't produce enough of the hormone cortisol and in some cases aldosterone.Around half with Addison's disease will develop another autoimmune disorder.\u00a0\u00a0The most commonly associated with Addison's is a either hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Other recognised associations with Addison's disease include premature failure of the ovaries, insulin-dependent diabetes (type I diabetes) and parathyroid deficiency.Medical studies estimate that around 5% of individuals with Addison's disease develops pernicious anaemia.\u00a0\u00a0A much smaller proportions of conditions are estimated to develop with Addison's disease such as vitiligo, coeliac disease, alopecia, myasthenia gravis, thrombocytopenia purpura, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome or rheumatoid arthritis.Excerpts from the article \"Schmidt's Syndrome: Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome 2\" by Elaine Moore:\"Schmidt\u2019s syndrome, which is also called Schmidt syndrome, was first named after the doctor who discovered the coexistence of Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis and Addison\u2019s disease in one of his female patients in 1926. Today, the term Schmidt\u2019s syndrome is also known as autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type II.Symptoms of adrenal insufficiency include muscle weakness, apathy, fatigue, appetite loss, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, low blood pressure (hypotension) that worsens when standing (orthostatic hypotension), hyperpigmentation or bronzing of skin (melasma suprenale), diminished ability to conserve sodium and excrete water, depression, irritability, salt craving, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), tetany (condition of muscle spasm caused by high phosphorus levels), diminished attention span, and numbness of the extremities due to excess potassium (hyperkalemia).\"",

            "answer": "I believe you should get evaluated by an endocrinologist- a neuroendocrinologist is the best kind.You are exhibiting numerous symptoms that could indicate you may have something that is quite common- a pituitary tumor.\u00a0\u00a0About one in five people have pituitary tumors and some of them are functional, such as the prolactinoma, which causes breast milk production (you mentioned leaking breast) and others are non-functional and can grow to a size where hormone production is being depressed.You should get a complete endocrine hormone work-up.\u00a0\u00a0Likely, red flags will demonstrate to the endocrinologist that they should order a dynamically done pituitary MRI, with and without contrast.On your other post, you mention nodules growing.\u00a0\u00a0Is this on your adrenal glands?\u00a0\u00a0If so, you might even have multiple endocrine neoplasms- please find the best neuroendocrinologist in your area and get a referral to them as soon as possible.",
