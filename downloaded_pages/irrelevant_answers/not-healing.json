            "answer": "My name is Carolyn. I am 30 yrs old. I am a Type 1 (brittle) Diabetic since 1984. I just got my first 2 Tattoos a couple of days ago. ( I feel really stupid now, but I wanted one so bad.)I got the first one starting on my foot going all the way up my leg. My whole foot, and ankle is a little swollen but not terrible my husband says. The pain was TERRIBLE! I am doing all the proper cleaning instructions. I got the other one on my chest. That one is okay and it was nothing like the one on my foot and leg. I am a little nervous about my foot and leg though. I made sure my blood sugar was good before going. I kept feeling like I was going to faint with getting the one on my chest. My blood sugar was ok. I got the tattoos a day apart, the first one took 3 hrs. the secong just a hour. If I were you I would seek medical help right away and not waste time because you could loose a limb. I will update on how mine are doing.",
