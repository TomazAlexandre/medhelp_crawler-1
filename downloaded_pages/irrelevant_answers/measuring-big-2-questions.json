    "question": "At my ultrasound today my baby measured 10 days ahead of where I should be.\u00a0\u00a0I thought I would be 14 weeks and the baby was at 16 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0She told me that the dating scan I had at 6 weeks would be much more accurate and that just because the baby is bigger doesn't mean that it is developing any faster.\u00a0\u00a0My first question is has anyone had this happen and what was the outcome?\u00a0\u00a0She said gestational diabetes could be a factor but she also said that the baby could've just hit a growth spurt and would balance out at the next ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0My other question is despite the development not being 16 weeks just the size do you think I might feel movement any sooner? Surely that only relates to size right?",
