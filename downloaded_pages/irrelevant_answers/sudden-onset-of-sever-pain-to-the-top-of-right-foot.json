    "question": "I am asking this question for my brother. He is 49 years old. Today he was sitting in a chair and when he got up his foot began aching and then throbbing. It is swollen, warm to the touch, and I detect discoloration of his toes. The big toe especially. About 4 days ago, he was hit hard in the ankle. He jumped around a lot when it happened but he managed to get up and walk after the pain subsided. There may be a link to this because after he was hurt, he walked around a bit and then that evening he took an 11 hour train ride. He was pretty immobile and didn't get good rest because he was in coach seating. Now, there is other possibilities as well. He has had several back surgeries because he broke his back years ago. His finger tips are numb most of the time these days and h e thinks it's because of syatic nerve damage due to his back problems. I was wondering if he is experiencing poor circulation all the way around. In addition to his back surgeries, heart disease runs in our family. I went into cardiac arrest last year myself due to plague build up in my arteries. The symptom checker suggests this could be the cause also. He is very stubborn about going to the doctor because he doesn't have insurance. I am concerned that he may be experiencing heart stuff or a blood clot, and I know both are serious. Can you give me your opinion please. Thank you very much.This discussion is related to/posts/Undiagnosed-Symptoms/swollen-top-part-of-foot-that-is-also-painful/show/707450.",
