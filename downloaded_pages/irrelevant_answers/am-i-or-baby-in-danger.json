            "answer": "That's what I was thinking, that maybe she's just forgotten. But everything is in the computer system where I'm from and she puts new info in there every week to document everything and get test results and what not so the GD has to be in there and she must know. She has forgotten things though like one appointment she forgot she looked at my ultrasound results that morning from the radiologist and asked me when I was going in to have my ultrasound done. She also hasn't asked to see my meter or book to check my numbers or anything and I've had to personally hand it to her and say oh yeah, here ya go.",

    "question": "The last couple of appointments have been weekly appointments and my doctor hasn't mentioned anything about my gestational diabetes. She says everything is normal and I'm not starting any prepress or anything an baby's heart rate has been perfect as well as my urine and blood pressure and she doesn't think I've had much swelling at all even though I've had bad days. My concern is, right before my weekly checks started, she told me at this point I'd be going in twice a week to monitor baby because of my GD and it'll be longer appointments but she hasn't attached any monitors to check my little girl out or made me come in for a second appointment in the same week. And I haven't really thought about it until now because 2 appointments hurts my work schedule kinda bad. But should I say something to her or call and ask one of the nurses if its alright? I don't want something to suddenly go wrong because I'm not getting proper care. My levels have all been normal and I'm finally gaining some weight back so I didn't think there would be a problem.",
