            "answer": "Dear Sun71,Thank you for contacting the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. None of us are physicians and cannot give medical advice. I can share my own experience as a volunteer and being the mother of a child who has had type 1 diabetes for many years.Because you stated that your mother is taking diabetes medicine I am assumming that she has type 2 diabetes. I am not as familiar with type 2 meds as I am with insulin (which people with type 1 must take). This is something that I would recommend discussing immediately with her doctor. Maybe they could try her on a different med (a dry cough and swelling of her glands cannot be good) but I do know that stopping her medicine and developing high blood sugars is dangerous both short term and down the road because of complications.You say that she is feeling pain in her legs. There is a common complication called neuropathy and can happen with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This is usually caused by running high blood sugars for a prolonged time and is nerve damage that can cause pain, numbness or tingling in the legs and feet. You may want to look at a website from the University of Maryland Medicine that has very helpful information on it. I have found it very useful myself. It is at www.umm.edu/diabetes.info/nerve.htm.Please talk to her doctor about both of these problems and they should be able to help.I wish your mother the very best and good luck.dm",
