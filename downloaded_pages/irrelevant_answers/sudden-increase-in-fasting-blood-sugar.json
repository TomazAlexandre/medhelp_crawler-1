            "answer": "First of all, it sounds like you have been working very hard and have been doing a great job!Unfortunately, it sounds like you may have progressed to diabetes, despite all that as often happens. You are obviously controlling your post-prandials (after meals) by eating so low carb, though that is hard to maintain. I think it's time to see your doctor, get a diagnosis and perhaps begin taking an oral med to help you control your blood sugar.",

            "answer": "First of all, congratulations on the weight loss and trying to get your body back to a healthy state. That's a BIG ATTA-GIRL. Look over the following links below, understand the information thoroughly, then consult with your doctor about treatment. If he/she cannot fully provide an answer, or what they suggest doesn't make sense, ask to be referred to an Endocrinologist, a specialist with diabetes care and treatment. Be sure to call the Endo first as there are some who are not up-to-date with the below. Find one that is and then go see him/her.Considering your after meal [postprandial] levels are very normal, high morning glucose levels can be attributed to what's known as Dawn Phenomenon.http://diabetes.about.com/od/whatisdiabetes/qt/dawn_somogyi.htmIt can be associated with LADA [Latent Autoimmune Disease in Adults] aka type 1.5 diabetes.http://www.diabetesmonitor.com/lada.htmXlnt LADA info on this forum http://tinyurl.com/lada-type1-5Ask your doctor to test your pancreas for insulin production. The test is called C-Peptide.\u00a0\u00a0http://diabetes.webmd.com/c-peptideWhile you're at it have your thyroid checked. An irregular functioning thyroid will disrupt your pancreas insulin production. The test is called TSH [Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone].\u00a0\u00a0http://tinyurl.com/testing-thyroid",

            "answer": "My thanks to you both for your prompt responses.I have been reading everything I can find on the topic for the past two weeks (a major case of denial -- I can't possibly be diabetic -- that happens to OTHER people) looking for an explanation and have touched on, though probably not thoroughly understood, all of the topics above.Most articles I read, prior to your link above, on the Dawn Effect, talked about adjusting insulin or medication and since I am on neither, I was not sure it really would relate to me.\u00a0\u00a0Also, most articles on LADA talk about folks that are not obese and don't have a family history of diabetes (I am and I do, though at the grandparent level).\u00a0\u00a0But I realize that it doesn't say you can't have that history and have LADA anyway...It is so hard for me to believe that I progressed from normal (albeit high normal) to diabetic in the space of 8 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Also the timing of the sharp increase with the start of the low-carb diet (it was the next day!) raises flags for me.Today, I will add back small amounts of whole grains and low-glycemic fruits.\u00a0\u00a0I need to see how that impacts the fasting numbers ( a girl can hope!)\u00a0\u00a0If they are still high, I will make an appointment next week.Again, thanks for taking the time to answer a newbie's question.",

You don't know this one way or the other until you get the tests I mentioned earlier.\"low-carb diet\"When consuming fruits, eat them with other foods to slow the digestion of fructose - fruit sugar.

    "question": "I am a 46 year old female, currently 70 pounds overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I have lost 27 pounds in the past 11 months.\u00a0\u00a0I had Gestational Diabetes with my last pregnancy and I have tested my fasting blood sugar once or twice a month for the past 8 years, with the results always between 85 and 99.In November, I noticed I was getting the occasional fasting glucose in the 101 to 103 range.\u00a0\u00a0By January, they were all in that range.\u00a0\u00a0Three weeks ago I started on the South Beach Diet.\u00a0\u00a0Phase 1 restricts carbs to a very low level.\u00a0\u00a0I have also started exercising on an elliptical trainer 20 minutes, 4 times per week for the past 2 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I know I am eating enough because my weight loss has been very slow -- between 1 and 1.5 pounds per week.To my surprise, my fasting numbers have INCREASED dramatically.\u00a0\u00a0My fasting numbers for the past three weeks have been between 111 and 157!\u00a0\u00a0Two hours after a meal I have been running between 95 and 110.I am so frustrated!\u00a0\u00a0I have lost the \"magic\" 10% of my body weight (more like 12%) and I am eating nothing but low-glycemic vegetables and low fat protein.\u00a0\u00a0Why are my fasting numbers out of control and why are my after meal numbers so great?",
