            "answer": "Good eve Ms. Debbie,I'm not in the proper position to prescribe or to suggest you with the exact treatment or diagnostic procedures. I'll just say you experience symptoms - sore throat, polydipsia, polyuria, thrush, polyuria, dysuria, falling out of hair, depression, amenorrhea.Try to look over signs of menopause considering your age. If the signs and symptoms mentioned above do not fit, it might be indicative of a medical condition. Sore throat and thrush might be due to resistance of your body to the medications you're taking. Polyuria, dysuria might mean presence of diabetes.... falling out of hair and amenorrhea might be indicative of a cancerous condition. So giving these possibilities, I suggest you have a general checkup from a doctor, and once the doctor gives the possibilities, try consulting specialists. It really helps to ask from these people.",

            "answer": "Debbie your response would help someone like me, but I guess Layman's terms would help the general public that I fear are concerned with attending a doctor's clinic (like myself) or have limited funding, they are asking whether their syptoms require further investigation.\u00a0\u00a0So for absolute understanding without being patronising debbie4586 polyuria - the need to urinate more frequently, dysuria - difficulty or pain when urinating, amenorrhea - absence of menstruation.\u00a0\u00a0I still feel give her weight and symptoms she should investigate diabetes and ? a urinary tract infection.",
