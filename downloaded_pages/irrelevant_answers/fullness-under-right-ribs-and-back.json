            "answer": "Hi, I've just started having a similar thing which started about 4 days ago. A weird tingling sort of feeling under my right ribs. Didn't think much of it at first but it seems to keep happening throughout the day and doesn't look like its going away or dying down. That's why I turned to the internet to try to figure out what it could be. Started to get freaked out. Im a diabetic so hoping its nothing diabetes related. Not sure if it could be my liver. Just read on another forum that it could be to do with the gallbladder. Not sure, but it's definitely worrying me! Trying to get an appointment with my doc. Please let me know if anyone has any ideas! Just feels like someones pushing a button, and it gives my like a flash of tingling fuzziness!",

    "question": "I have this fullness under my right ribs and a burning feeling out the back and a sour stomach. I went to my general doctor and he thinks it is a pulled muscle so I went to my chiropractor, he said it could be but I had some ribs out. I am so confused, I have thought about my gallbladder and even thought of my liver and lungs because I am a smoker and drink beer. When I lean up it feels like my ribs are setting on something.This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/235592\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/235592</a>.",
