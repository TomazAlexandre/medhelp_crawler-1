            "answer": "have you got diabetes? usually if you ovulate your own then they should not put you on clomid. unless they think you are producing eggs but they are maturing to conceive. because at that stage i heard never seen it in written they give you clomid so they can produce strong eggs. Metformin is used either for PCOS or Diabetes. i was on metformin for almost year and clomid for 6 months only conceived once and ended up with MC. also if you are over weight they give metformin to help you reduce weight as well especially in PCOS. PCOS is never shown in blood test you need a good scan... :)best of luck anyway... hope it works for you....",

It ended up being a tubal pregnancy but I did get pregnant on only metformin. My doctor has now added clomid to the mix because my progesterone levels were lower than they needed to be although I was having a regular period at 31 days. Take the metformin at night before you go to bed so if it causes any side effects you will be asleep for it!",
