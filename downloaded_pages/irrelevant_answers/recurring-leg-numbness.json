            "answer": "Thank you for your responsed. they are greatly appreciated. I have had an MRI in the past for the first time my leg went numb. they did not find anything wrong with me.\u00a0\u00a0They claim i do not have diabetes or hypothyrodism. As far as the abnormal calcium, potassium, or sodium, i have had a few cases of low potassium when i had kidney stones. Kidney stones can also be from too much calcium, i do have alot of calcium build up under my fingernails. I dont know if maybe that means anything? I\u00a0\u00a0cant see a doctor until i figure out my insurrance, i just recently moved from Ohio to South Carolina. So i havent got around to finding another doctor yet. I have been taking multivitamens\u00a0\u00a0everyday, so im not sure if the low vit B12 and D would be a factor because i still have the problems with or without the vitamens. The one doctor mentioned maybe texting my sciatic nerve but being that i am so small, he didnt want to risk it. Ive been checked for circulation problems, there was none that they found... so i guess my best bet would be to figure out my insurance asap and find a doctor and see what they think down here. My left leg IS still currently numb :(\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again for your responses :)",

            "answer": "Also i didnt mention before because i wasnt sure that it would be a factor, but i do have stage two endometriosis as well and alot of the endometrial tissue was located\u00a0\u00a0behind my uterus, would that maybe cause compression on the sciatic nerve?",

            "answer": "Endometrial implants can sometimes be found in very unusual places, so I wouldn't rule out where it might be located in you, but I'm guessing it's pretty unlikely that would be the source of sciatic nerve compression.\u00a0\u00a0I had severe endometriosis prior to my complete hysterectomy and some was on my bladder, which is somewhat unusual, but happens to some people.\u00a0\u00a0During my hysterectomy, my bladder was found folded and stuck to my uterus with that sticky endometriosis after my first operation on endometriosis the previous year.\u00a0\u00a0It sure was reaking havoc with my bladder function, let me tell you!",

    "question": "Hello. i posted this in another forum and have not received ANY responses, so i thought id try another forum.I am 20yr old Female. 107 Ibs. 5'6\"I was wondering if anyone would have any ideas on what is causing my problems.Monday, February 8th, i woke up and my left leg, from my knee-cap all the way down to my ankle was completely numb.. i thought may have been the way i was sleeping or something.. but it is STILL just as numb to this day. (Feb 20)This is NOT the first time this has happend. In 2007 my right leg, from my hip to my knee-cap was completely numb for two weeks straight. then went away. My mother told me that i have had problems with this type of thing happening ever since i was real little as well. She told me that when i was two, both my legs did that at the same time and i couldnt walk for a month.I can walk fine now, i can move my legs and everything. Its just numb. Kind of a warm numbness.For as long as i can remember i also get RANDOM knee pain that feels like a \"stabbing\" pain that lasts for about 5 minutes. That happens once every half a year to a year. And i get horrible Hip pain (both sides) almost everyday. Occasionally bad enough on the left side to where it makes me limp for a few minutes. And the SLIGHT head movements. For example if im trying to concentrate or listen, my head will slightly rock back and forth, not enough for other people to really notice, but enough to where it isnt normal.I would assume this has something to do with a neurological problem... so if anyone has any ideas on What exactally that problem could possibly be. Please let me know. Thanks.",
