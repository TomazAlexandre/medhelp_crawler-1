            "answer": "I have also had this band of pressure across my forehead for years. It's not a headache, just pressure like a tight rubber band, and very bad brain fog. Could this be from my pituitary? I also have osteoporosis. I was diagnosed at 35. My growth hormone levels are also on the low end of the range.",

            "answer": "No, I've never had a head injury. I was a breached birth and have read this can cause pituitary damage.I've seen 5 endocrinologists and they barely knew how to deal with thyroid let alone pituitary. They only looked at my TSH and made me worse until they gave up on me because they didn't know what else to do. Endos seem to be better at treating diabetes than thyroid.I have found an endo who specializes in pituitary disorders but she needs a doctor referral and doesn't have appts until March, so I'm working on that.",

    "question": "I'm 44 and have had low female hormones since I was a teenager. I've never had regular periods and am now very hypothyroid and have adrenal issues. I've had 2 MRI's, both didn't show a tumor, but showed my pituitary gland was concave. So my doc thinks because it's abnormally shaped it's causing the problem. I have the CD. Would you be able to look at the scans? I just really believe there's a problem with my pituitary gland that either can't be seen or has been missed. I keep trying to replace the hormones, but still feel bad and my levels aren't rising very fast.",
