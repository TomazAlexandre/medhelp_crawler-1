            "answer": "Hi Brittany,How is your Mom? Definite diagnosis of bone cancer is usually not made by imaging studies alone. Additional tests may need\u00a0\u00a0 to be done. Back pain may be attributed to a variety of issues such as musculoskeletal conditions, gynecological conditions or infection.\u00a0\u00a0Her anemia may also warrant further evaluation to determine the underlying cause. It is best that she talks with her attending physician also for proper evaluation. Take care and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "They did a blood test and said that they found cancer cells and wanted to do a biopsy. (They think it could be lymphoma) but she didnt want them to do. I guess shes scared. She keeps comin up with all these excuses. She left the hospital and now her feet are swollen and her lower back, tail bone is swollen. Im very scared. I dont know why she is doing this to herself.",

    "question": "Hi my name is Brittany. This question is pertaining my mom and her symptoms and an MRI test. Well for the past 7an half weeks now my mom has been having back pain that moves to her left side. Sometimes it just be in her left side and sometimes it just stays on her back. It comes and goes. For a little background she has PKD (polycystic kidney disease) she has diabetes and is anemic as well. Oh and kidney stones. Now back in Dec towards the ending or beginning shortly after we moved the back pain started. She was movn things as well then the pain started. She went to a hospital and they told her (i think they did x-rays) it was a pulled a muscle or some sort. He gave her sumtn but it didnt really help. So she went to otha hospital and they thought it could be an ulcer or gaul bladder but she left the hospital and didnt get the test done. The last hospital she went to they gave her a blood transfusion because her blood was low from the anemia. She was ok afterwards. Then they did the MRI test and she ended up leaving. But the technician called me and said she found spots on her spine and it could be bone cancer and she needs to see her pcd and kidney doctor and get another MRI...is it definite that its bone cancer? My mom is 67 by the way and cancer doesnt run in our family (not saying you cant get it from that).",
