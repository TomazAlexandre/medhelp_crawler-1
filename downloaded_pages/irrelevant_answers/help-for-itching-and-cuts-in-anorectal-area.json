    "question": "In Late January I had a vaginal procedure. Almost immediately I began experiencing painful itching in vaginal, perenium and anorectal area. When I went in for my follow-up I mentioned it to doctor and he said it was a yeast infection and to use the appropriate medication. That did not help. I asked my pharmacist what she recommended and since, I have tried an antibiotic, hemmoroidal cream, hydrochloride cream, and Desitin. The vaginal area is actually doing much better, but the area around my anus is still hurting, itching and bleeding. Upon inspection by my husband, he found several small cuts in the area. Some of these creams have soothed the itching and pain, but then it starts all over again. I use wipes when I have a bowel movement, as toilet paper was making things worse.What can this possibly be? What's the best way to deal with it?",
