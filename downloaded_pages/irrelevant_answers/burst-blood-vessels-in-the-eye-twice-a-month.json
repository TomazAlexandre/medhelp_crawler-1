    "question": "I am female, 43 years old,very fit and healthy. I started getting burst blood vessels on the whites of my eyes about 6 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0I have never experienced this condition before.\u00a0\u00a0It happens at least twice a month in different parts of my eye and in both eyes. It is painless and does not affect my vision.\u00a0\u00a0I don't even feel it happening.\u00a0\u00a0People just start saying to me, \"Ewww your eye is bleeding. It's so gross\".\u00a0\u00a0It looks so awful that I feel like I should wear dark glasses. I have not changed anything about my lifestyle. I have had my blood pressure checked by my GP and she assures me it's fine.\u00a0\u00a0I even had full blood work done to see if I was anemic.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not.\u00a0\u00a0I had a full eye exmination by my Opthamologist and was assured that it's just a case of \"many fine capillaries\".\u00a0\u00a0I don't believe that this is happening for no reason.\u00a0\u00a0I'm scared it may be a brain tumour or something.\u00a0\u00a0Why would this suddenly start happening to me on a regular basis?\u00a0\u00a0Should I ask my Doctor for an MRI?\u00a0\u00a0Do you know of any conditions that could cause this to happen so regularly?",
