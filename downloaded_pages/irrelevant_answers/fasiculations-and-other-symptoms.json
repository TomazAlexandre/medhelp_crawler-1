            "answer": "Dear Elaine:ALS does not give a patient pain, so I would not think he has ALS.\u00a0\u00a0Muscle weakness, fatigue, cramping, without sensory changes, an abnormal EMG that shows positive sharp waves, fasciculations and maybe fibrillations are the hallmark of ALS, so I would think that your neurologist based on his/her exam and EMG would have given your father the diagnosis of ALS.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms are too vague without doing the neurological examination and seeing the lab results to give you somesort of diagnosis over the internet.\u00a0\u00a0Many patients with spinal problems have fasciculations, fatigue, pain, weakness etc.\u00a0\u00a0Most of the time there are other reasons for the spinal problems, such as arthritis, lupus, diabetes, etc that compound the spinal problem and give vague symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Give your father's neurologist a chance to view the labs, follow the neurological exam, and see if a good diagnosis doesn't follow.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that it is something simple and fixable.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

            "answer": "I have been twitching for 14 months without any other symptoms (maye be sensory ones of creepy crawliness and tingling here and there)....after 2 normal neuro exams - one after 4 months of fasc. and one after 7 months of fasci... would you rule out ALS as a possibility? I woudl think weakness would have shown up long ago.",

    "question": "I have posted before in July about fasiculations.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate your comments.\u00a0\u00a0My husband has been to nuero now and has had another MRI this time of his low back.\u00a0\u00a0He does have pain in his low back that occasionally is shooting and short in frequency.\u00a0\u00a0To refresh you, he went to the dr initially for fasiculations that started in his left shoulder and weakness in both shoulders, fatigue, and a general feeling of ill health.\u00a0\u00a0He does not routinely go to dr's nor complain, so I knew he did not feel well.\u00a0\u00a0The cervical MRI shows spondylosis, rather severe for 52.\u00a0\u00a0He has reduced his caffeine intake and still has fasiculations which are more widespread and diffuse.\u00a0\u00a0The neuro, kept saying the degree of spondylosis was what was causing his pain...my husband has no pain in his shoulders, only his low back, thus the 2nd MRI was ordered.\u00a0\u00a0He continues to have great weakness, the emg and ncs were abnormal but I am not sure in what regards.\u00a0\u00a0The neuro is convinced that he should be in lots of pain.\u00a0\u00a0He has also ordered ANA, CPK, T4, CBC with diff, and sed rate.\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned about ALS.\u00a0\u00a0What is your opinoin from these vague symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0He has been in very good health and is not overweight.\u00a0\u00a0He has enough fatigue that he does not want to play golf or hunt like he used to, and after a day at his office, he is in bed by 8 for the night.\u00a0\u00a0Any other tests that we should wait for,,,or ask for if they are not ordered...?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you..",
