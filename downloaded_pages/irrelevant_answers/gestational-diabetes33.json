            "answer": "I have it. Basically your body is unable to break down sugars due to the hormones your placenta is generating. It goes away after you give birth. Its very common, not your fault and nothing you could have prevented. If you have it then you will have to monitor your blood sugar levels throughout the day and follow a diet that limits your carbohydrates. If your levels remain above the allowed limit your doctor will prescribe a medication called glyburide. Its a pill. Sugars that remain uncontrolled over a period of time pose some risks to the baby (large size, insulin problems at birth and very rarely still birth-but that will NOT happen if you are following orders) Most likely your doctor will order non stress test 2xs a week where they monitor baby's heart rate and movement. You will also get more ultrasounds to monitor baby's size and possibly have an earlier delivery date. I was hysterical when I was diagnosef . But after meeting with my doctor and a dietician I'm OK. The diet is very simple, my sugars are under control and my daughter is just fine. I am almost 35 weeks. She is even measuring just fine. Don't worry, this is something easily controlled and very common. If you have any questions feel free to contact me. I promise you I have asked my docs everything under the sun. No worrying :)",
