            "answer": "So far I have. I've had 2 natural mc in last 8 months. I'm about 6 weeks along now. Not out of the woods yet but this pregnancy feels soooo much different than my miscarriage pregnancies. When I miscarried I was having pain & bleed right from the beginning. This one I just feel pregnant.I was heartbroken after my 2nd mc. We had been ttc for 6 years & when I was finally able to get pg I kept losing my babies. I didn't want my husband to even touch me for a while cuz I didn't want to try again just to lose another. I thought about giving up & just being happy with my 9 yrs old son. But obviously I didn't & I'm praying this little bugger wants to stay. Best of luck to you.",
