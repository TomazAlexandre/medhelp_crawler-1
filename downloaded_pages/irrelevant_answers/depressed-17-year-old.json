            "answer": "Thanx 4 the comments!!!Actually, she's been seeing a counselor since november & she's still depressed. she's been on a diet since about feb. or march of this year & has lost about 20-25 lbs but she still feels the same. she recently had her gallbladder removed & the surgeon told her to go to her family dr. to be put on a diet that's best 4 her, so soon she'll be going to a weightloss program to help her lose weight.Also, the dr. doesn't want 2 prescribe any med. b/c he thinks once she starts losing more weight, she'll be less depressed & eventually won't need to take any med.What do u think? is this the right step 2 take?Thanx again!!! : o )\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jean",

            "answer": "While she may certainly be depressed due to her weight, before we call this clinical depression, make sure you have ruled out conditions such as diabetes and hypothyroidism. I have seen more than one patient (more commonly female as hypothyroidism is more common in females) come in with fatigue, obesity and signs of clinical depression, who on further testing (simple blood test) was found to be hypothyroid.",
