            "answer": "You are doing only 1/3 of what is necessary to control and manage your glucose levels. Maintaining normal body and daily 30-60 minute exercise must be undertaken. As you know, diet alone does not do the trick. You must adhere to all three - diet, weight, and exercise.And, yes, illness can spike glucose levels.I don't know what you mean by \"if one can eat more normally by taking Metformin\". If you mean return to your old eating habits that created your diabetes, absolutely not. One must adhere to a diabetic diet/nutrition to prevent diabetes progression.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your comment.\u00a0\u00a0I should have provided more info but wanted to keep it brief.\u00a0\u00a0My weight is good and I do exercise - walking is what I love.\u00a0\u00a0There is a history of Type 11 on both sides of my family and I did have gestational diabetes back 40 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0And no obesity in family either.\u00a0\u00a0About 30 years ago, my mother insisted I be checked for diabetes, given the history.\u00a0\u00a0Imagine our surprise when this doctor I had seen told me I couldn't possibly be diabetic as my babies weren't big enough!\u00a0\u00a0She would not even send me for any testing!\u00a0\u00a0Should have changed docs but that was back when I thought they were 'gods'.\u00a0\u00a0 And while I admit to having enjoyed my homemade baking over the years, I have also eaten very healthy.\u00a0\u00a0I cook from scratch, restaurant meals perhaps once a month.\u00a0\u00a0When we lived elsewhere, I also grew all our own veg.\u00a0\u00a0I have always tried very hard to provide my family with good, nutritious food.I have been very ill with heart problems - born with, had surgery as a child, and had major heart surgery last year when they finally found I was diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0At 62, I have 'wonderfully clear arteries' and my cholesterol is excellent.So given my history, you can perhaps understand me saying how I have tried to eat well and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0I know how important it is from many levels.I was just wondering if taking medication, which I truly do not want to do, would allow me to eat pasta, rice, potatoes, etc. which all seem to really spike my blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I usually have one slice of whole grain bread a day.Checked my BS this am before my breakfast - 14.1, only a handful of unsalted peanuts at 9pm last night.\u00a0\u00a0Breakfast - oatmeal with milk, an egg, half a Mandarin orange and coffee.\u00a0\u00a0Will check in a couple of hours and see what's what.And I have wondered if I have not been diabetic for a long, long time and perhaps that no matter how hard I try, meds may be what I need to do.Just thinking out loud........",

            "answer": "I don't know if this test is available in the UK, but Decode Genetics, the Icelandic company whose researchers found the gene variant TCF7L2 gene appear to be associated with the highest risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, and also can predict the likelihood that a person will convert from a state of pre-diabetes [borderline blood sugar levels] to full-blown Type 2 diabetes. This is something you need to discuss with your Endocrinologist.\"I was just wondering if taking medication, which I truly do not want to do, would allow me to eat pasta, rice, potatoes, etc. which all seem to really spike my blood sugar.\"A major problem everyone deals with when first diagnosed lies with not understanding what foods to eat and what foods to avoid. I think everyone first starting out, including myself, misunderstood how important foods we consume affect our glucose levels. And no, medication will not allow you to eat any food one wants. Medication helps you to lower glucose levels. The key word is 'help'. The best approach to diabetes is, of course, prevention. You have to make a conscious effort towards making lifestyle changes. Making lifestyles changes to ones diet is not awful, not difficult. Instead of trying to figure out what not to eat focus on what you should eat. Avoid white foods [pasta, rice, breads, crackers, potatoes] as these quickly turn into sugar after digestion. Eat quality proteins like fish and fowl, nuts and seeds, beans and legumes, fresh vegetables and small amounts of whole grains. All dairy milk contains sugar. Switch to unsweetened Almond or Hemp [no THC to get you high] milk. Fruits contain fructose, fruit sugar. One medium Mandarin orange [2.5\" or 63.5 mm] contains 9 grams of sugar where 7 grams equals one heaping Tablespoon of refined sugar.Google search 'low carb/low sugar fruits'. If you eat fruits eat them with other foods to slow absorption of fructose [fruit sugar]. Drink water not soda or energy drinks or dairy milk. Also, eat smaller meals more frequently, exercise at least 30-60 mins a day [doing cardiovascular exercises], and keep stress low with meditation & a worry free mind.Remember, your best friend is your home glucose test meter. Until you can grasp which foods your body can tolerate it is extremely important to test your glucose preprandial [before a meal] and postprandial [2-3 hours after a meal]. The latter will inform you how the foods you ate 2-3 hrs earlier affect your glucose levels.",
