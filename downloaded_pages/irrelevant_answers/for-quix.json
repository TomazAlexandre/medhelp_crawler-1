            "answer": "Hi Sally,Yes I have had my thyroid checked and been checked for diabetes and bloods taken for other rare diseases which come back all negative. I'm just so sick and tired of having all these symptons and getting no answers. Even if the next mri's come back clear I know I still won't be convinced I have ms due to all the symptons being ms related, and knowing that others have also had clear mri's and been diagnosed years later. I had 2 G.P's baffled when I had the face pain, they put me on neurontin, panadene forde, sinus meds, sinus infection meds, then a stronger one, even my chemist and dentist talked together for me and give me more medication, the pain just left slowly after about 4/5 weeks, it was not a stabbing face pain but a dull ache under eye brows, jaw, cheeks, nose and across forehead, it was there 24/7 and it was winter and the cold irritated it more, and I remember my nose bone hurting it give me some relief when I squeezed it, but it never actually stopped the pain. Even now I have noticed when I have a hot bath or shower the tingling in my feet worsen and then when I get out and cool down it seems to subside. I really just can't handle the not knowing and the waiting for all the tests and results. I had a miscarriage a few weeks ago so now I am on the lookout for another outburst of symptons. Thanks so much for your response, can I ask you are you diagnosed? Take care, Melissa",

I am a very anxious person particulary regarding health, but I know stress or being anxious is not causing these symptons, and don't believe that stress could cause all these symptons and for such a long time.

    "question": "Hi Quix,I have had tingling, burning, numbish feeling but not actually numb, face pain, twitching which all started in June of this year, with face pain 1st during a rotten cold. When the face pain stopped I looked up TN on the net when a dr thought I had it and come across ms and symptons, then realised I had tingling in my hands, both feet and groin, it stayed from June to about Nov, July I had mri of brain and whole spine , no contrast, neuro did nerver conduction test and bloods all neg, she told me I do not have ms. Upon returning home from seeing her in July, I was off balance particulary when I looked up or to the side too quickly, I have also had altered sensation up both arms, legs, lower back and groin area, under feet feel numbish, ankles and feet often burn and sometimes I get the cold feeling on legs. Went to 2nd neuro he took more bloods and made me walk, close eyes hold out arms, tapped me on the legs or knees etc, told me ms is very unllikely and that I may have a sensory neuropathy, today I have a numbish feel to whole face, groin tingling comes and goes, feet comes and goes from being 24/7, some burning, off balance seems to be going, mild twitches,I am going for a 2nd mri next week this time with and without contrast, I am so convinced that I have ms and that it cannot be anything else, 2nd neuro said these symptons could just leave and never come back, nice but I really don't know, last x-mas I had a ct of spine because of lower back pain similar to period pain, and then a couple years ago also, all clear, it just said I have early OA but nothing ms related, can ct of spine detect ms? If all these symptons are related wouldn't the July mri have picked them up? Because I have had clear brain, spine, bloods, eyes fine, the test I did for him in the office, good nerve conduction test, make my chances of having ms more unlikely, or does all these tests really mean nothing and I could still have ms and just nothing showing up yet, as on another post I read that a lady had symptons since about 1991 I think it was and all clear tests, and only a diagnosis this year? I am scared because of the next mri and even if it is clear also it still won't get my mind of ms due to the persistent symptons.",
