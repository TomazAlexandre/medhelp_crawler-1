            "answer": "Dear TShelton,My son also wanted to join the military.\u00a0\u00a0He was diagnosed at 8 years and is now 27. As a mother and volunteer of JDRF, I cannot give you legal advice as part of our organization.From our own experience, we talked to many organizations regarding this matter. Unfortunately, back in 1992 at least, the military won't budge in this matter.\u00a0\u00a0Even thogh we know of all of the forward technology that is available for people with diabetes, it seems to me the military is a bit behind the times.\u00a0\u00a0While I agree in someways with active combat, I never felt one should be disallowed with serving in a non-combat position.I hate to be negative on this very important question but the only solution you might have is to retain councel, but in our case, my son didn't get far.If he couldn't go into the military, he wanted to join the police force or become a firefighter.\u00a0\u00a0Again he was turned down for the same reasons. Times are changing so please don't give up.\u00a0\u00a0Jesse fought forestfires in Montana and Idaho this past summer which can consist of 18 hour days and is skiing on a local pass for propatrol during the winter. He will also be attending college to further medical training to help in hospital trauma.I guess my point is there are many ways to serve your country.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like your passion is with the military, but please, if the military cannot be realized, look at other options.\u00a0\u00a0My son did and realized as long as he was protecting homes from fire or helping the injured on ski slopes, he was helping others.I know this is not what you wanted to hear, but my hope is that things will change.\u00a0\u00a0Look for other comments that maybe posted with different answer's.Best of Luck,dm",

            "answer": "I am a type 1 diabetic who is married to a military colonel. The problem is that the military cannot accept a diabetic and then give him or her \"preference\" by not sending that diabetic person into an area that does not have medical care. It would be terribly unfair to the other military people to \"prefer\" the diabetic by not sending him or her into a position that might threaten his or her life. When it comes to life or death matters, all absolutely MUST be able to carry the same load, and must be able to survive if supplies are not able to be delivered. If a person cannot survive under those conditions, they cannot be accepted into military service. It is only fair to the other military people to only accept those that can fully serve without any preference. Like you, I am fully healthy. But you must be realistic and accept the fact that we absolutely must have that insulin. There is no way the military will ever be able to bend those rules. One alternative would be to take a civil service job on a military base, for frankly, there are many civilian positions open now that used to be filled by active duty military as the military downsized budgets have forced many jobs to become civilian now. I have worked as a civilian doing pilot training courseware, and there is no discrimination at all as far as the diabetes is concerned in civilian jobs. There are civilian jobs in almost every area of military life now. I would check these out carefully upon graduation from college. Pay and benefits are good and you are a full part of the military mission as a civilian.",

            "answer": "Of course I care deeply about folks who wish to join our military \"family\" and I respect your for that desire. If you were put into a war zone, anything can happen (just read the news about troops being ambushed daily). Now we both know that not all folks end up in war zones, and if so, maybe not often. But from what my spouse tells me about policies (he is a personnel officer), the problem is the one time it can happen. The military cannot be responsible for protecting that one vial of insulin. If you are separated from it in a war zone, you would be at risk. And of course your compatriots would want to help you, so their lives may be at risk because of that effort to try to help. Now, this happens all the time in military situations -- some folks will get shot down in a helicopter like the one that was shot down while on their way to R&R, and the others all stopped to try to help. But the difference is that there is no previous possible danger or weakness to those troops which would perhaps make them less able to survive if they did get captured or their immediate supplies were blown up. I understand that one vial of insulin lasts a good month, and most of us keep a spare handy just in case one breaks. But in a situation where a convoy was stopped and you were perhaps taken prisoner, your life would be in peril. This is perhaps a long shot, but it is possible. And a commander in charge, knowing that this may be a danger, may be hesitant to put you at risk and this could end up favoring you over some other guy. Even a hypoglycemic episode due to stress could put your buddies at risk if you were unable to function at top ability.I am merely a spouse, and I know that the recruiters are simply going to list what the rules are and turn you away. I suspect that if you tried to contact the Personnel Center (in the Air Force, this would be the Mission Support Squadron), you will be given the same info. But feel free to try, for they may explain their policies better than I can as an observer and outsider. Or maybe they will simply send you the form letter saying that they cannot accept you. No telling. But it doesn't hurt to ask the questions. Just don't count on changing any policies. All the policy-making is done at much higher levels than the nearest base.As for civilian jobs, try checking out the nearest military base's web site. I know that they usually are found at www.basenamehere.branchofservicehere.mil (i.e., www.randolph.af.mil for Randolph Air Force Base in Texas). Once you are in, there is usually an employment link. Each base handles its own web site, so you may have to go browsing to find the employment link. There really are tons of civilian jobs out there in almost all fields. if they require special security clearance, many of them will see that their candidate gets the necessary clearance after hiring. There perhaps is no real glory in being the civilian partner to the active duty person, but the jobs are there and need quality people who understand military concerns. I encourage you to check them out. I have been proud of the times I have done civilian jobs for the military while married to my active duty spouse.",

I'm 6' 210 pounds and 12% body fat. Want to still call me a retard? I would love to serve my country if I were allowed, but I'm not. I can't drive a truck, I can't be a cop, I can't be in the FBI or CIA. My only options are desk jobs. People like you who don't understand what diabetes is and what a diabetic has to do to live are the \"RETARDED\" ones.I have a friend of mine that is in the military and he has tried to get me to go in time and time again, but due to my diabetes I can't. He does not know I have it. That is how good I am. I keep up with him and he is way up there in the military. I have a four year degree and could come in as an officer if given the op (Still want to say I'm retarded).GET A LIFE MAN.

            "answer": "I know I am a little late weighing in on this topic, but better late than never. I have a lot of personal experience dealing with some of the issues that have been discussed in previous posts.I joined the Army National Guard in January of 1998. I chose to lead a civilian life, but also had a passion for serving my country. I have been on several deployments, both stateside and overseas, including 18 months spent in various parts of Iraq in 2002 and 2003. It wasnt until 1/05 that I ended up in the hospital for 7 days due to diabetes. I was shocked when the doctors told me that I was diabetic. I played soccer, football, wrestled, and stayed active for the military my entire life, and had essentially controlled or atleast kept myself out of the hospital through diet and excersice without even knowing it. I know have a much better control of my diabetes with the assistance of very small amounts of insulin 4 times a day, coupled with a strict diet and excersise.The point of this isnt really to tell my life story, but to tell you how it has effected my career in the military. I have 2 friends that have been in my unit over the years that were diagnosed with diabetes well after enlistment, cases very similar to mine. One of them was medically discharged without much fight and the other put up a fight but eventually lost. He is now a police officer in TX. My leadership did thier best to keep my condition somewhat under wraps, due to my insistance and ability to continually prove my worth and right to serve. Eventually it caught up to me as the unit had to undergo a medical screening in preparation for another deployment to Iraq. I was then assigned to a medical review board and summoned to appear last March. Going into the MMRB I was fearful as to what would happen as I was told by everyone that I had talked to that I didnt stand a chance to be recommended to retain. Regardless, I decided to atleast put up a fight and hopefully make some head way for those that followed me. I talked to my endocronologist and submitted myself to a clinical trial involving inhaled insulin, did a lot of research, and found as many talking points as I could to make a point.The time came and I showed up at my MMRB without representation, which surprised them as most people trying to stay in have a first sergeant or commander along side. Mine however were serving in Iraq at this time, but I did have a former commander offer to come in and say a few words to vouch for my commitment to the Army, and ability to perform in and out of combat. I opted to go alone though, not wanting him to see me in a moment of weakness as I assumed I would be referred for seperation. Ater I had been givin all the opportunity to present myself, and had fielded many questions from the panel I was sent to wait for what seemed to be hours, but I am sure was much less, while the board deliberated. I was called back into the room and told that they had made a decision that had not been an easy one and had not been unanimous. As I prepared for the worst they continued to expail there decision and informed me that they had decided to refer me for full retention. This was a decision that had to be sent up and signed off on by the adjutant general and has taken until 11/08 to be finalized. The board did not place any restriction on my profile but informed me that if my unit was to be deployed in the future, I would noy be allowed to go and again be sent for evaluation by another MMRB, that may not be as favorable to me. As we speak I am still a active member of what I condider to be one of the finest national guard units in the country, but looking for another unit that is less deployable long term.Although I cannot help in joining the armed forces as a prediagnosed diabetic, I can tell you that there is hope for those in the future. Only 5 years ago that same MMRB would not have even thought about referring me for retention. I wish you the best of luck.",

Lets face it not one person in the World Trade Center on 9-11 thought they were in a combat zone but by 9-12-01 that's exactly what NYC looked like.Lets call a spade a spade, the government is worried about the health care costs of diabetics in the military, watch how quick they start taking type one diabetics in non-combat AND combat positions once universal healthcare passes the house.FamilyNP2009",
