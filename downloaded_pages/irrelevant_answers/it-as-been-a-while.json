            "answer": "Do u have type 1 diabetes or gestational diabetes? My mom has type 1 diabetes also know as juvenile diabetes and she had a c section with me and my sister. I think as long as u have a good high risk doctor and u try to listen to everything they tell u. Taking ur insulin, checking u blood sugar and eating right is very important when u have diabetes especially pregnant. Diabetics normal have big babies. I was premature (born at 7 months) but still weighted 7lbs. Don't let ppl scare u into thinking u or baby is going to die. I wish u had positvity around u. Wishing u the best :)",

    "question": "I am now 31 weeks..I have a 8 year old son..I just have a few concerns.1) Is it normal to feel so much pressure.. I do work and with that I am\u00a0\u00a0on my feet while over 8 hours some days.Is anyone a diabetic or know someone that is a diabetic and pregnant?I am a diabete and really need to know could I really deliver my baby vaginally? Or is it really save to just do a c-section? I have friends and they tell me by me being a diebetic it will be saver for both of us. My co worker toad me her sister had 3 and almost die with all of them. My friend toad me her step mom almost die and her little sister has a birth.. So u can see why I am asking.My daughter have to turn around frist if not I will be having that scheduled c section anyways. I just want to know all my options before going in.this will be my second c section if I have to get it.And I am a little concerned cuz my daughter is only 3 pounds and 13 ounces right now but I'm only 31 weeks so..But if she only gain a pound a month by the time she get here she will be 5 pound. Is that to small? I just what her to be health that is all I want.Last question...by me being a diabetic if it possible that my daughter can be a diabetic as well? I try to eat healthy but I do have my days where I just want to be pregnantin my doctor doesn't really seem to be alarmed about my number diabetes numbers.??",
