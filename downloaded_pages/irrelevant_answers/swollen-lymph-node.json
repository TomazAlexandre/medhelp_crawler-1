            "answer": "Thanks for your question and for visiting the Family Practice Forum.I can tell you right now that what you describe is most likely a sebaceous cyst.A sebaceous (or epidermoid) cyst is a noncancerous swelling under the skin. It is lined by packed outer skin cells. The cyst itself is filled with oil or dead cells. Under certain conditions such as stress, increased activity, mechanical irritation, diabetes, or other concurrent illness these cysts may enlarge and become somewhat tender. On occasion, these cysts will be drained by the physician and antibiotics will be prescribed. Warm moist compresses will commonly help bring these cysts",

I have taken antibiotics and put hot pads and it doesn't go away.\u00a0\u00a0It usually hurt and sometimes it gets really irritated.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the doctor and they said I had to live with it... Now I have refills on anitbiotic whenever I need it but that never takes care of it.\u00a0\u00a0I also use a special soap, for less bacteria in that section.",

    "question": "I'm a 36 year old female. Five days ago I noticed a peanut sized lump under my arm. It is actually on my inner upper arm, close to the underarm.\u00a0\u00a0There was a faint round red mark on the skin. It was a little tender.\u00a0\u00a0The next day I stuck a needle in it (I know I shouldn't have) and a bunch of pus and blood (sorry so gross) came out.Now it seems to have gone a little deeper and is harder and elongated, but still about the size of a peanut, but longer.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't really hurt, unless I mess with it.\u00a0\u00a0Now and then I get a bit of a twinge in that area, but I'm obsessed with it now, so maybe it is my imagination.I have had a sebaceous cyst in the vaginal area before.\u00a0\u00a0It sort of feels like that.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think it is a boil, because the skin does not really seem to be involved.Could this be a lymph node?\u00a0\u00a0Do cancerous lymph nodes become filled with pus and blood?\u00a0\u00a0I don't think I'm fighting off any sort of infection.\u00a0\u00a0This thing SEEMS to be in the fat layers, and unfortunately I have more than my share of fat layers. I've had a couple of mammograms in my late 20's.\u00a0\u00a0I had them because I ran to the doctor frantic over breast pain.\u00a0\u00a0Both were negative, except that I have fibrocystic breasts.\u00a0\u00a0I think he only let me have the mammograms to shut me up.I would appreciate your comments. Thanks.Susan",
