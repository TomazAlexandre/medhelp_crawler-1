            "answer": "Yes diabetes just kind of sets in like that unfortunately and it can be passed on to children as there is a genetic component to it. I would suggest calling a dr and see what their cash fee is. Many dr offices allow people without insurance to pay cash at a reduced cost than the normal visit they charge the insurance for. Some dr offices are open on weekends or one night a week for those who are working. You can also try going to a free clinic but i would suggest absolutely seeing a dr about this sooner rather than later. The longer you wait to treat it the more difficult it will be to treat",

            "answer": "It definitely sounds like it's time for a physical, blood work, etc... The symptoms you describe can be indicative of many different problems, although given your family history, diabetes is definitely a possibility. Don't jump to conclusions though- often after having babies, women develop hormone and thyroid problems.The thought of having a long term medical problem is very overwhelming. You want to know, so that you can take proper preventative measures and treat it early BUT you also don't want to know. The longer you put off the tests, the longer you can fool yourself into thinking everything may be fine. I am speaking from experience, although for a different condition. I have decided to go ahead and face the possibility and get the testing done. I am terrified of what it may tell me, although it can go the other way and give me peace of mind.You have an extra problem though, as far as insurance. I do have insurance, but of course the one doctor in my state with a specialty in what I need is out of network, so I am paying a bit for everything. Is there any way you can get insured? Obviously, if it is diabetes, you will have many expenses. There are some ways to save (ex: my diabetic friend's meds were really cheap generically at Walmart) but if you need meds not available generically.",

    "question": "I know this isn't the forum for this, but I trust you ladies so so much. The past few years I've been having horrible migraines, slowly I started peeing more and more and I'm ALWAYS hungry. For no reason. i know I'm not hungry but I am. it's weird to describe. I'm always tired. No matter how much or how little I sleep I'm exhausted. I'm irritable and moody and just so cranky for no reason. Occasionally my hands or feet will get cold and numb. Like right now...my hands are freezing and I'm sitting in front of a heater, with a blanket, in sweats and my heavy fuzzy bath robe. I'm not pregnant. I know I'm not pregnant. Af just made her monthly visit not even 2 weeks ago.The thing is...diabetes runs in my family. My grams was diagnosed with it when she was in her 40's. I'm nowhere near 40. I'm only 25. I know, I know diabetes can hit at any age. I'm not obese. A few pounds over weight...yeah but I had twins and I'm still working off the baby weight. I'm still active, eat healthy (I'm the crazy person who goes to fast food places and gets salads. lol) and I work out when I'm not exhausted and sleeping or working. I looked up diabetes symptoms and everything I've been experiencing is what it says for diabetes. I'm also not one to look too into symptoms but...I can't help it. I want to go to the docs but I don't have insurance right now. I do know if diabetes is left untreated it can be deadly. Of course I don't want to die...but how do I know it's really that and not something else? I can't afford to just take off work to go to the doctors and if need be we can pay for it....and can it just set in like that? Just out of the blue, bam you have diabetes? Could I have passed it on to my kids? Dh's side doesn't have diabetes problems...or any real health problems besides asthma which I have and already know how to deal with. This....I don't. I've seen my grams go into her diabetic shocks, have to give herself insulin shots, and what happens when she doesn't. It's scary. i don't want to go through that or have my family see me go through that....If it's not one thing with me it's another. I just can't seem to catch a break. :o(",
