Basically, he wanted a base line, in case there are vision issues... so far, nothing that I've noticed, thankfully...how are things other than that?Karen",

            "answer": "When I was being assessed for my trial I had to have had a recent opthalmological evaluation on file.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor told me if I had to go on rescue treatment I would be taking interferon and this might cause \"cotton wool spots\".\u00a0\u00a0I looked this up and this is what I found:~~~\"These yellow-white spots are called cotton wool spots. They are caused by retinal nerve fiber layer microinfarcts. Exploded retinal ganglion cell axons extrude their axoplasm like toothpaste. Expect to find cotton wool spots arrayed around the optic disc and along the temporal vascular arcades.Cotton wool spots have a myriad of causes. Any process that occludes small retinal arterioles will do this: hypertension, diabetes, HIV, severe anemia or thrombocytopenia, hypercoagulable states, connective tissue disorders, viruses, lues, Beh\u00e7et's and many others~~\"What I pick up from this is that there are a number of conditions that can cause this problem.\u00a0\u00a0While some reactions to side effects from the HepC drugs may be outside of one's control, unless of course you want to stop the treatment, other conditions which could add to it or make it worse may be within one's control.\u00a0\u00a0I see, for example, that diabetes could cause such a change.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes means sugar and fats.\u00a0\u00a0Could reducing one's sugar and fat intake help?\u00a0\u00a0I would think it is worth a try.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe you are not like me but I often comfort myself with fats and sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Could treating any anemia help?\u00a0\u00a0Lowering blood pressure?\u00a0\u00a0These are just random ideas.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I hope this helps a little bit.",

If I try and read something looking down towards my nose, it's clear, but straight on, that's where it changed.\u00a0\u00a0What frustrates me is I had an appointment on Friday and was at the mercy of a friend on an errand to get something, and yup, they didn't get me back in time (I was let's say, less than happy....), so I missed my appointment, so now I'm afraid to do my shot tomorrow in case it's the shot that's causing the problem.I do worry about anemia as I've had a problem with it and started off on the low side (had a hysterectomy for this reason in July).\u00a0\u00a0I'm already very winded trying to feed horses.\u00a0\u00a0Blood work tomorrow so am anxious to see what it comes back as.",
