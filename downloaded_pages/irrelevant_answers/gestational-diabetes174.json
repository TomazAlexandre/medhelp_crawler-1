But if you end up using insulin it will not effect the baby because that is a hormone naturly made in you Nast that your bady would not be making for itself. Try not to stress its kinda hard at times because you have to watch what you eat. Also keep in minde that a lot of ladies fail the one hour and pass the three so you might not even have a problem",

            "answer": "I have it as well and it not as bad as it seems. I just watch my carbs and control it with my diet and it's been going fairly well for me. There are a lot of options out there that you can switch to that help control the hungry and it's actually a healthy way of eating. I was eating a lot of sweets and was afraid I was gonna be miserable but I've found some good alternatives. Check out the Atkins food line in the diet section they have good candy bars that I eat when I need a sweet. Also string cheese is a great snack if your hungry but can't have any carbs. I any less found some low carb options for things like bread at the grocery store so that I can eat those too. Just search the Internet for diabetic recipes as well they give you some really yummy ideas. My new favorite meal to cook myself is steak and chicken fajitas. Everything but the tortilla is on the free food list.",
