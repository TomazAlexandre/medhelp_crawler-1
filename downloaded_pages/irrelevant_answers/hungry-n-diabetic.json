            "answer": "Often GD isn't tested for until 26 or more weeks. If you are in a high risk group then perhaps you will be tested earlier. GD is high sugar levels. If you are GD then you should by rights be monitoring you blood sugar levels (BSL)\u00a0\u00a0at the least 3 times a day. Also you should have been informed of what foods to avoid and what is ok to eat.\u00a0\u00a0I was informed that carbs are ok in proportion. You also must eat 5 small meals spaced evenly through the day. Low GI foods are great. Talk to your dr if you have GD you may need insulin and more intensive care or monitoring. It's not something to rely on half guesses with. Good luck.",
