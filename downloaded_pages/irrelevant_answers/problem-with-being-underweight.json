            "answer": "Hello!Well, as you know, one of the problems why you arent gaining enought weight is because you're having frequent stools & diarrhea.You're body absorbs calories & nutrients in the small intestine and then it passes thorugh the large intestine and the reaming waste is excreted.If you're having yellow stools & having trouble digesting fatty foods it could be a malabsorption of fat due to pancreatic insufficiency.In pancreatic insufficiency, the pancreas is unable to produce enough digestive enzymes to appropriately digest food and therefore help facilitate proper nutrient absorption. It typically occurs as people age or can result from stress. Conditions such as pancreatitis, diabetes, cystic fibrosis and cancer can lead to pancreatic insufficiency.Symptoms include malabsorption, malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies and weight loss or the inability to gain weight. Due to an inability to properly digest fats, a common symptom of pancreatic insufficiency is steatorrhea \u2014 loose, fatty, foul-smelling stools. High blood-sugar levels or poor blood-sugar control might also be a common symptom in adults.Treaments include Digestive enzyme supplements to support proper digestion. Enzymes help make up for decreased enzyme production and reduce stress on an already overstressed system. May also be given vitamin supplements, especially fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K, since chronic pancreatitis is associated with lowered fat absorption. A diet low in fat and high in protein and calories might be recommended to help patients gain and maintain weight.This is just my opinion, with the problems you've listed above. But defently tell your Dr. about digestion problems you are having so they can make a correct diagnosis & get you gaining weight :)Good luck & I hope everything works out for you.",

            "answer": "thanks,I was also tested for diabetes/blood glucose and some liver stuff (maybe to point out chron's disease?), which both came out good. Blood sugar was 5.9, which is quiet high actually, but the limit of a problem range was 6.0. (its actually very high considering I didnt eat for 10hrs before the test, wondering why the limit is so high?).I also had bunch of other blood tests taken, but they all came\u00a0\u00a0normal except the bone thing... Is there a blood test that can show pancreatic insufficiency?",

            "answer": "I agree with Alicia; sounds more like pancreatic, with the yellow stools.\u00a0\u00a0Are they weird (foul) smelling, and frothy?\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, it's worth checking out.\u00a0\u00a0Stick with working with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I was losing wt. uncontrollably, though eating.\u00a0\u00a0Mine may be a medication issue; I just finished weaning off the prime suspect; am stable, no loss, no gain.\u00a0\u00a0However, before that, my doctor did a dietitian referral.\u00a0\u00a0She has been a big help.\u00a0\u00a0Her services were free, didn't even take insurance; was through the health care facility I'm using.\u00a0\u00a0Also, have you seen the \"trackers\" on this web site?\u00a0\u00a0There are many, including weight and food.\u00a0\u00a0Those have been quite valuable, and a big help to my dietitian.\u00a0\u00a0My dr. was also impressed.\u00a0\u00a0You might want to check it out; can be a valuable diagnostic tool, tracking everything you eat, along with wt. (create a profile to find them.)Good luck.",

    "question": "Hello,I have a pretty bad weight problem, and I suspect its caused by something other than the diet that I am on. First off my BMI is currently around 16, yet I eat pretty normally (2000-3000kcal a day). So I think I have some kind of metabolism / malabsorption problem. I have always been underweight even reaching BMI of 14, but recently I got the chance to go to a doctor about this. So far we have concluded that my thyroid and liver is normal, but I have some problem with some hormone that controls bone growth, doctor suspects this is cause I dont eat enough(namely vit D), BUT I do eat enough (=always when I am hungry, besides I take plenty of D). Again, it doesnt even seem to matter what I eat, I always end up eating about the same amount of calories, if I try to eat more it DOES work for month or two but then I get really bad appetite loss and diarrhea if I try to eat more. Even puked couple of times.I also have problem with my stools. They are soft, very frequent(after every meal) and sometimes yellow. I think that its possible that I have some type of fat malabsorption which leads to that. If I eat a lot of fat, like take butter oil etc. I always get yellow stools and even more frequent bowel movements.Any help on this is greatly appreciated. Its kind of hard to believe that I am naturally this thin still at this age (20, male).",
