            "answer": "Hello,if you manage your diabetes very well (diet, exercise, weight management, meds, as required) then your lifespan is no different from any other person.Depending what type of diabetes you have and your family history, children may have a slightly higher risk of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0But mostly this can be addressed and prevented / delayed by healthy lifestyle.What type of diabetes do you have?\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, type 1 or type 2, they are both manageable.\u00a0\u00a0And As I said, when managed well will not affect your lifespan.",

            "answer": "abhimanyu64 - What you have read are nonfactual articles because they leave out race, gender, sex, age, and eAG [estimated Average Glucose], and daily habitual living conditions. I have yet to see an article from research hospitals claiming shortened life span with a diabetic who controlled and managed their glucose levels. No studied needed for those who ignore this disease and let their glucose levels progress. Their life span will be shortened.You need to understand not everything on the internet is true or based upon factual evidence. When you see an article that mentions a study or studies or a research you need to see if they name them or provide a link to the clinical trial/study/research, not a link to another magazine/newspaper/iNet article. Look at the URL to see who is reporting the findings, then look for what was first mentioned.As far as passing diabetes onto your children, that depends on you. Usually children of type 2 diabetes parent/s do not get their parent/s diabetic gene but pick up the parent/s bad habits. It is up to you make lifestyle changes and educate your children when of age.Re-read, understand, and apply what was explained to you in your previous threadDiabetes Type 2by abhimanyu64, Mar 22, 2011 12:07PM",
