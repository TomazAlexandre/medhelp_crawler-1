            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!There are two things you must look into seriously. The status of your diabetes should be seriously looked into. Type 2 diabetes can result in serious weight gain. The second thing is hypothyroidism. Both can result in restless leg syndrome like symptoms due to peripheral involvement of the nerves. Polycystic disease of the ovary with insulin resistance is the third cause. Fasting blood sugar, blood sugar after 2 hours of food and glucose tolerance test should all be performed.Along with all these menopausal evaluation must be done.Hope this helps. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "HiThanks for keeping me posted!When multiple organs are involved, then autoimmune component should be looked into. It appears that you have multiple endocrine function problems that have not been seriously looked into. It would also be a good idea to consult an endocrine specialist.Please discuss this with your doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I went to the doctor about my asthma (which I've had for years) and they decided to do a complete workup.\u00a0\u00a0I went to\u00a0\u00a0the cardiologist,and he said I have something where my heart beats okay, but doesn't \"rest\", and sometimes I have extremely rapid heart rate.\u00a0\u00a0So bad that a couple of times I've had to go to the emergency room, and they don't know why this happens.Now, I've gained almost 80 lbs, and haven't changed anything, like eating habits, exercise, etc.l\u00a0\u00a0They don't know why after doing a bunch of thyroid (I have low thyroid) and cortisol tests.Then I started getting skin tags, which I'd never even heard of, but I'm getting them all over the place.\u00a0\u00a0And I am getting thrush under my breasts and the inner part of my groin area.I sweat profusely and cannot tolerate the heat anymore.\u00a0\u00a0I am EXTREMELY tired, but started to have insomnia.\u00a0\u00a0I'm depressed all the time and just feel hopeless.\u00a0\u00a0Nobody believes me about the weight gain even though I show them pictures of what I really look like!!All these doctor's are treating different symptoms, but it's doing no good.\u00a0\u00a0I'm no antidepressants, and all of them I've been on do no good.\u00a0\u00a0I'm on sleep meds, and they barely work.\u00a0\u00a0I can't even work right now because I'm so tired all the time.Now, it seems that I have gastroentestinal problems, which I have never had before.\u00a0\u00a0I'M A MESS!!!\u00a0\u00a0And to top it all off, my RLS, which I just recently got, along with borderline diabetes, is getting progressively worse.I've been to so many doctors that that's all I do is go from one to the next, I feel like I'm a hundred years old, and I'm only 57.\u00a0\u00a0I'm at the point of giving up, because I don't know who to go to anymore or what to tell them, and I'm tired of the let down.Any advise?",
