            "answer": "Maybe you could help me.I had a couple of MRI scans which showed up areas of high attenuation consistant with demyelination on the brain and spine.The only symptom i have is Pareasthesia\u00a0\u00a0around the spine and i'm not sure if this is related.M.S,Devic's and Clinically isolated syndrome are what my neurologist is testing me for but i was curious to know if it was possible that drug use could have caused these areas that showed up on my scan.I am not a user at the moment and have never been a regular user but once after taking Ecstasy [1 pill] i collapsed for around 10 minutes.I didn't have any neurolgical symptoms after this,but could this have caused any damage on my brain and spine?I took less than half a pill at a later date and passed out for a short time.I haven't taken it since.I was drinking alcohol on both occassions.I have also taken Cocaine on several occasions but i have never had a bad experience with this.I would appreciate any help and advice.Suzie.",

            "answer": "Dear Dr. Kirksey,I'm incredibly concerned with my risk factor of obtaining a stroke.My mother (48) had a massive stroke unexpectedly in January and passed away.\u00a0\u00a0She was active, fit, and was not sick.\u00a0\u00a0She ate a healthy diet, with an occasional glass of wine.\u00a0\u00a0She did not smoke or do any type of drug.\u00a0\u00a0According to her test results from the hospital, she didn't have high blood pressure or cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0She had an unusual amount of bacterial infections leading to UTI's and Bladder infections, as well as migraines.\u00a0\u00a0She also had endometriosis (?) since the age of 15, where she's been taking Depo shots to control it.\u00a0\u00a0The only symptoms prior to the stroke was fatigue and the usual migraine she obtained.\u00a0\u00a0I'm confused how she could of had a stroke, and what I need to know to prepare.\u00a0\u00a0My family history has no heart disease or Diabetes, but we do have stomach and prostate cancer.As for myself, I'm a 23 year old white female that lives in Southern California.\u00a0\u00a0I don't drink or smoke.\u00a0\u00a0I've been generally healthy most of my life, with a few exceptions.\u00a0\u00a0I do get migraines, and have since I was 13.\u00a0\u00a0I had my nose cauterized when I was 12 to prevent excessive nose bleeds.\u00a0\u00a0I've also had scarlet fever when I was 12.\u00a0\u00a0I had a stomach ulcer (due to stress) when I was 16.\u00a0\u00a0I also have Osgood-Schlatter disease, which has for the most part gone away, except for the slight bumps from the calf bone which lands slightly lower on my knee cap.\u00a0\u00a0I will admit though, that I do have an extreme amount of stress on me (especially recently since my mom's passing and arranging her funeral).Please let me know what I should do to prevent myself from obtaining a stroke like my mother.Thank you in advance for your time and aid on this matter!Tizzle",

    "question": "Stroke Risk FactorsSome stroke risk factors are hereditary.\u00a0\u00a0Others are a function of natural processes.\u00a0\u00a0Still others result from a person's lifestyle.\u00a0\u00a0You can't change factors related to heredity or natural processes, but those resulting from lifestyle or environment can be modified with the help of a healthcare professional. Fortunately, most risk factors are under our controlWhat risk factors for stroke can't be changed?Age - The chance of having a stroke more than doubles for each decade of life after age 55.\u00a0\u00a0While stroke is common among the elderly, a lot of people under 65 also have strokes.Heredity (family history) and race - Your stroke risk is greater if a parent, grandparent, sister or brother has had a stroke.\u00a0\u00a0African Americans have a much higher risk of death from a stroke than Caucasians do.\u00a0\u00a0This is partly because blacks have higher risks of high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity.Sex (gender) - Stroke is more common in men than in women.\u00a0\u00a0In most age groups, more men than women will have a stroke in a given year.\u00a0\u00a0However, more than half of total stroke deaths occur in women.\u00a0\u00a0At all ages, more women than men die of stroke.\u00a0\u00a0Use of birth control pills and pregnancy pose special stroke risks for women.Prior stroke, TIA or heart attack - The risk of stroke for someone who has already had one is many times that of a person who has not.\u00a0\u00a0Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are \"warning strokes\" that produce stroke-like symptoms but no lasting damage. TIAs are strong predictors of stroke.\u00a0\u00a0A person who's had one or more TIAs is almost 10 times more likely to have a stroke than someone of the same age and sex who hasn't.\u00a0\u00a0Recognizing and treating TIAs can reduce your risk of a major stroke. If you've had a heart attack, you're at higher risk of having a stroke, too.What stroke risk factors can be changed, treated or controlled?High blood pressure - High blood pressure is the most important controllable risk factor for stroke.\u00a0\u00a0Many people believe the effective treatment of high blood pressure is a key reason for the accelerated decline in the death rates for stroke.Cigarette smoking - In recent years, studies have shown cigarette smoking to be an important risk factor for stroke.\u00a0\u00a0The nicotine and carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke damage the cardiovascular system in many ways.\u00a0\u00a0The use of oral contraceptives combined with cigarette smoking greatly increases stroke risk.Diabetes mellitus - Diabetes is an independent risk factor for stroke.\u00a0\u00a0Many people with diabetes also have high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol and are overweight.\u00a0\u00a0This increases their risk even more.\u00a0\u00a0While diabetes is treatable, the presence of the disease still increases your risk of stroke.Carotid or other artery disease - The carotid arteries in your neck supply blood to your brain.\u00a0\u00a0A carotid artery narrowed by fatty deposits from atherosclerosis (plaque buildups in artery walls) may become blocked by a blood clot.\u00a0\u00a0Carotid artery disease is also called carotid artery stenosis.\u00a0\u00a0 Peripheral artery disease is the narrowing of blood vessels carrying blood to leg and arm muscles. It's caused by fatty buildups of plaque in artery walls.\u00a0\u00a0People with peripheral artery disease have a higher risk of carotid artery disease, which raises their risk of stroke.Atrial fibrillation - This heart rhythm disorder raises the risk for stroke.\u00a0\u00a0The heart's upper chambers quiver instead of beating effectively, which can let the blood pool and clot.\u00a0\u00a0If a clot breaks off, enters the bloodstream and lodges in an artery leading to the brain, a stroke results.Other heart disease - People with coronary heart disease or heart failure have a higher risk of stroke than those with hearts that work normally.\u00a0\u00a0Dilated cardiomyopathy (an enlarged heart), heart valve disease and some types of congenital heart defects also raise the risk of stroke.Sickle cell disease (also called sickle cell anemia) - This is a genetic disorder that mainly affects African-American and Hispanic children.\u00a0\u00a0\"Sickled\" red blood cells are less able to carry oxygen to the body's tissues and organs.\u00a0\u00a0They also tend to stick to blood vessel walls, which can block arteries to the brain and cause a stroke.High blood cholesterol - People with high blood cholesterol have an increased risk for stroke.\u00a0\u00a0Also, it appears that low HDL (\u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol\u00a0\u00a0is a risk factor for stroke in men, but more data are needed to verify its effect in women.Poor diet - Diets high in saturated fat, trans fat and cholesterol can raise blood cholesterol levels.\u00a0\u00a0 Diets high in sodium (salt) can contribute to increased blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0Diets with excess calories can contribute to obesity.\u00a0\u00a0Also, a diet containing five or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day may reduce the risk of stroke.Physical inactivity and obesity - Being inactive, obese or both can increase your risk of high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease and stroke.\u00a0\u00a0So go on a brisk walk, take the stairs, and do whatever you can to make your life more active.\u00a0\u00a0Try to get a total of at least 30 minutes of activity on most or all days.What are other, less well-documented risk factors?Geographic location - Strokes are more common in the southeastern United States than in other areas.\u00a0\u00a0These are the so-called \"stroke belt\" states.Socioeconomic factors - There's some evidence that strokes are more common among low-income people than among more affluent people.Alcohol abuse - Alcohol abuse can lead to multiple medical complications, including stroke.\u00a0\u00a0For those who consume alcohol, a recommendation of no more than two drinks per day for men and no more than one drink per day for nonpregnant women best reflects the state of the science for alcohol and stroke risk.Drug abuse - Drug addiction is often a chronic relapsing disorder associated with a number of societal and health-related problems.\u00a0\u00a0Drugs of abuse, including cocaine, amphetamines and heroin, have been associated with an increased risk of stroke.",
