            "answer": "I am having the same problems. I've had Type 1 since 28, and I'm now 45. I will be in the bed and usually the front of my ankle will cramp up. Within seconds every muscle in both legs from the knee down will lock up. The only way to get them out is to stand up and walk around, which is very painful and difficult. I have actually fell twice doing this. Once spraining both wrist and once busting my head and ribs during the fall. Nothing seems to trigger them. My blood sugars are usually normal. A few times they have been worse after a hard day working outside and losing a lot of fluid but most of the time they are unrelated to exercise or fluid loss. My doctors don't seem to understand or care. I would try anything to get some relief.",

            "answer": "I have been IDD over 50 years. A few years ago I began having these severe cramps described above, beginning in front of ankle and rapidly moving down top, mostly, of foot into toes. I have no explanation for the cause, except it seems to occur when my blood sugar is moving rapidly, either up or down - maybe both if I am simoogying (sp?). I do all of these so don't know which really is helping:1. salt2. tonic water (you can't buy quinine anymore but it is in tonic water)3. hot water soaks4. walking (if you can without falling or passing out from the pain)5.deep breathing and conscience relaxation (this one is the hardest)I've thought about going to pain management. Maybe I could learn some more copping tools! But I agree, an explanation would be real nice!Treepadg",

    "question": "I am a Type 1 diabetic who has recently been suffering from leg, foot, toe, ankle, thigh, and even hand cramps so bad that I can hardly stand it.\u00a0\u00a0I get the foot and leg and ankle cramps usually in the middle of the night, and then can't sleep.\u00a0\u00a0It is almost a nightly occurance.\u00a0\u00a0My ankle sort of keeps cramping up, and then it spreads to my toes and calf.\u00a0\u00a0It is absolutely unbearable.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering if ANYONE can tell me where to start to find out what is causing this.\u00a0\u00a0I have asked my primary doc, endocrinologist, and kidney doctor, and they don't seem to be concerned or know what to do to help me.\u00a0\u00a0They have ordered blood work, but it always comes up ok.\u00a0\u00a0I take vitamin supplements ( Calcium, Magnesium, B12, Potassium,), and drink 2 glasses of V-8 everyday.
