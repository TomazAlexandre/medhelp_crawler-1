            "answer": "It is really hard to tell if your symptoms are PMS or if they are early pregnancy because they mimic each other so highly. Are you late for your period or trying to get pregnant? I would say if you are late then definitely take an hpt but do not pee for 3-4 hours before taking it or take it first thing in the morning. Good luck! Fingers crossed for you!",

Have you been checked for PCOS?\u00a0\u00a0That can cause the symptoms you describe.\u00a0\u00a0It's certainly possible that you are pregnant but other things could be going on too. Gaining 8 Ibs in a week is concerning and is something that should be evaluated by a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0This type of weight gain is not indicative of pregnancy but sometimes occurs\u00a0\u00a0in the 2 nd or 3rd trimester and is the sign of pregnancy complication.",

It doesn't quite seem like my normal period though, i don't have any cramping or hot flashes and its bright red and my usual periods are usually very dark and associated with a lot of cramping. Hm.",

    "question": "Hello everyone, i've got quite a few symptoms and would love to hear some opinions. I've never been pregnant before, i'm 21 and a newlywed. About 3 weeks ago I started getting horrible heartburn and indigestion, and unfortunately it hasn't gone away - sometimes its so bad that it wakes me up at night! Also, about a couple of days after that started my nipples started to get very sore, and are still super sore! Sometimes they will get a little tender when its time to start my period, but never like this! I haven't been able to wear a bra in days the slightest touch hurts really bad. Also, i've put on 8 lbs in a week (i think i'm retaining water, my hands and ankles/legs were a little swollen for a few days) I have to pee at least twice an hour and I even have to wake up and pee which is extremely unusual for me. I've been having mood swings, some days I get mad at the smallest thing and other days I just cry. Also, i've been breaking out a little on my face and my chest and I rarely get a single pimple. I'm exhausted 24/7 even if I've just rolled out of bed. About a week ago i had a moment of sharp pains (twinges?) like right behind my belly button and sometimes it would radiate downward. It only happened for a day, but then it happened again tonight? Also, i've noticed myself being a lot more \"lubricated\" lately. Oh and one last thing, today some of my discharge was a pale brown color and only saw a tiny bit of it when i wiped and it was only there on 2 occasions of me going to the bathroom. My husband thinks I'm pregnant and said he could sense a change in me, and apparently one of our pregnant friends told my husband that she saw me the other day and said i was \"glowing\"\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, i'm going to try and wait a week before i take a hpt, But until then please let me know if this sounds like pregnancy to you or if you've had some of these symptoms before. Thanks!",
