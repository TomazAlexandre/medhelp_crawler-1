            "answer": "Hello.Have you observed if the numbness varies with any particular activity ? And how is you physical fitness ? I guess the hemoglobin was checked.Some vitamin deficiencies may also lead to such symptoms. You can go ahead and try vitamin supplements for a few weeks and see.Do you have any family history of similar problems ?Regards",
