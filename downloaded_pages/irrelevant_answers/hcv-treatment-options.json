            "answer": "The liver enzymes are markedly elevated.Obtaining imaging studies like an ultrasound would help make the determination of cirrhosis, but a liver biopsy would be the most definitive test.I would also perform blood tests looking for the severity of viral hepatitis and ruling out hemochromatosis.Abstaining from alcohol is imperative.These options can be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

No sign of splenomegaly either.What blood tests should he perform in order to see the severity of the viral hepatitis? His viral load was 1.200.000.Thanks again.",

    "question": "My husband is 53 years old. He was infected with HCV in 1986, during a blood transfusion follwoing a car accident. He only became aware of this infection in 2002, when he was discovered with type 2 diabetes. Until then, he used to drink alcohol and didn`t have a food regime. He stopped drinking, he now has 4 insuline shots daily(NovoRapid and Lantus), and is phisically fit.He was told he cannot have the interferon treatment because his thrombocites are around 100.000, although his Quick time is good.His latest blood tests revealed the following levels:-ALT-264-AST-170-CHOLESTEROLE-172-TRIGLICERIDES-324-ALBUMINE-50.1-BILIRUBINE-DIRECT:0,41;TOTAL 1.29-THROMBOCITES-106.000-GGT- 84I would like to know what further tests does he have to take, how can we find out to what extent is the liver damaged(they wouldn`t perform a biopsy because of the platelets), and what his treatment options are. Some doctors say it is still chronic hepatitis, others say it has already turned into compensated chirrosis. What is the truth and how can we find it? Thank you so much.",
