            "answer": "Thank you so much Doreen for taking the time to help me, I do not have any of the above I was fine till I had lasik other than the vision over age getting less -\u00a0\u00a0you mention \"Treatment usually needs to be for multiple weeks\" I have been doing the drop for 5 weeks so do you think I just need to give it more time, the pressure is great has been tested many times and dialations many times, so just give it time I guess not sure, I had a feeling to much prednisolone was not not good at present I am told to use it every 6 hours and the Nevanac every 12 hours sound right ?Regards, Rich",

    "question": "Hi:I am about 6 weeks out from my second lasik touchup both eye were done not a great outcome left eye had a touchup all was great next morning went for my right eye touchup and this eye is a mess, I have found out that its cystoid macular edema which is very rare after lasik is this true, can lasik cause this can't seem to get a straight answer on this, I did not have anything like this before the surgery, my vision is like being under water I was told to take ketoralac as a substitute for acular as my insurance did not cover the acular, went for a second opinion and this lasik surgeon agreed with CME, and thought it was better to use prednisolone along with nevanac,\u00a0\u00a0so my question is this permanent or will in most cases it will get better soon I hope this is terrible to live with one eye.Thank youRegards, Rich",
