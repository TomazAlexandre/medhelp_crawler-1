            "answer": "hi, the cerebrovascular accident is not shown on cts at the first hours. usually drs do it after some hours, specially in bleeding cases. and you should know that symptoms after a stroke are severe at the beginning and first months but they get better after some months by therapy and medications. this is more visible in hemorrhagic cases because the bleeding will be absorbed. the golden time for therapy and improvement after stroke is the first 6 months so follow the treatment exactly especially at this time. the other important point is your mother age which is high and it makes the neuroplasticity process slower and more difficult than lower ages. but don't worry about her improvement most patients show good results specially in walking. the chance of its repetition will decrease by a suitable diet and exercise program and controlling blood pressure.regards",
