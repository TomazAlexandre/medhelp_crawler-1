            "answer": "thanks for your input. While searching for info on thyroid and circulation problems, I came across Raynaud's phenomenon, a sensitivity of the feet/hands to temperature changes that can affect the penis as a result.My hands/nose don't go cold unless I'm in the cold, but my feet can go cold real quick and STAY cold during winter. I think this may be it.Regarding possible diabetes, after looking that up, the only symptom that I do have is the cold feet. But I will get a blood test to see.Thanks for your help!\u00a0\u00a0You've steered me in the right direction.",
