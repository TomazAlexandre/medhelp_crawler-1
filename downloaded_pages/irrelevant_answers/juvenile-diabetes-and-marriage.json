            "answer": "Hi John,I am NOT diabetic, but I have been married to my Type 1 diabetic husband for 12 years. Everyone has their issues, some more severe than others. Asthma, allergies, depression, sleep disorders... no one is with out problems. So, being married to a person with diabetes has it's ups and downs, good and bad days. We make adjustments as needed and keep plugging along. I don't think I'd let this disease decide whether I would marry the person I love or not!!Once you fully understand the disease and your loved ones needs, it gets easier to deal with and not as scary, it's still scary some days. It's never going to be easy all the time. I support my husband with his needs, time schedules and eating requirements, as well as make sure he follows up with all his drs. as needed. He wants to live as normal of a life as the rest of us. He wants to be as healthy as possible so we can grow very, very old together.You need to understand the disease and support your spouse with everything that you have. It won't happen overnight and it will take trial and error to get through the bad days. But it's certainly not impossible.I hope this helps and good luck!",

            "answer": "Hi.I myself have been a juvenile diabetic for 12 yrs (now 20) and was going out with a fellow juvenile diabetic. Although it might have seemed easier for us to recognize the signs of high and low blood sugar in each, we actually had quite different symptoms. Once you learn your partners symptoms of when they are having a high or a low blood sugar, the relationship part will be exactly the same as any other relationship. the diabetes never put a strain on any of my relationships that i have had because i do not let it define me. I am a girl first and a diabetic second. We're completely normal people from the outside that just need a little help on the inside. Just give the one you love all the support they need. you guys will be fine.-Cuteshell16PS. Coming from experience, never tell them that you understand what they are going through cuz in a way you don't. You don't feel what we feel when we have a high blood sugar or a low blood sugar. It is different. its like i can't say what it feels like watching your daughter grow up with diabetes (in my parents case). its just an argument i've had with friends and family before and it gets old.",
