            "answer": "Two weeks of doxy sounds like standard nonLLMD treatment ...Your old test results that you post above indicates Lyme, to my understanding:\u00a0\u00a0band 23 is specific to Lyme, meaning no other bug would make that band light up on the test.\u00a0\u00a0One positive band may not be enough for a nonLLMD to get excited about, but the tests are imperfect and are only an indicator, not the last word.I just googled \"lyme chicago\" and there were lots of hits that could lead you to a Lyme specialist.\u00a0\u00a0That's what I would do, as annoying and time consuming and expensive as it can be -- I'm not medically trained, but I've been through the swamp with Lyme.Best wishes to you -- let us know how you do, okay?",

            "answer": "I hope things work as the doc says!\u00a0\u00a0Glad he gave you meds to take -- will keep a good thought for them working as they should.I have to say I don't understand that saying about the odds of getting tick-bit twice with Lyme rare.\u00a0\u00a0What exactly do they base such an opinion on?\u00a0\u00a0Because of the way the statistics are done, where one has a 'true' case of Lyme ONLY if the tick is seen, the rash appears, blah blah, that means the numbers are smaller than they should be, and then if those numbers are used to predict the number of Lyme cases, of course it will be too small compared to reality.\u00a0\u00a0And another thing:\u00a0\u00a0there is no logical correlation between having been bit once being a preventer of being bit again!\u00a0\u00a0That's simply illogical.\u00a0\u00a0No one would say that about bee stings or mosquito bites.\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, I got a bee sting last summer, so I won't get one this summer.\"\u00a0\u00a0Aggh.The mainstream medicine view of Lyme is that it's hard to get, but that's based on cooked numbers.\u00a0\u00a0Your doc is following the standard line, which is not a huge surprise.I would suggest that you google \"chicago lyme\" and find an LLMD in your area for a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0You don't have to, of course, and I know finding and going to another doc for something the first doc is sure is handled already seems way down your list of things you need to be doing.May I ask what viral syndrome the Tamiflu is for?",
