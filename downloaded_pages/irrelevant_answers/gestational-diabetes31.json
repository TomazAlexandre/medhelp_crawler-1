            "answer": "I had it at the beginning of my pregnancy. Im about 33wks now so its not so bad now..but just changing your diet can be hard. But it'll be better later. Try drinking low fat milk 1%\tor no fat. Try not to eat any spices, pepper especially. No chocolate (hardest part for me). If you aren't already doing so no caffeine. And easy on the dairy.Try salads with chicken or fish and lots of fruit. If your good with your diet you'll pribably be able to eat normal soon enough. Good luck",
