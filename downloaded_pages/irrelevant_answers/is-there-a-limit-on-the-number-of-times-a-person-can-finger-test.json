I will be getting on the real time monitor soon and that checks every 15mins so the only thing that happens when you check alot is sore fingurs.I have been told by people i check way to much. but my doctor has me check that much.\u00a0\u00a0I guess it all depends on how your body works and my is very challenging when it comes to sugars.",
