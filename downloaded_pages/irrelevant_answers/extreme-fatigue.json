            "answer": "Dear Friends,I have very much enjoyed my time on Medhelp and have learned from you even while hosting our Ask-A-Doctor forum for Diabetes. Sadly I am leaving the Medhelp community as my own practice has become busier and time constraints have proved quite challenging. So from April 7th 2008 I will be officially away from Medhelp, but you can still find me at our practice website www.endocrinehelp.com, so please drop me a\u00a0\u00a0line if you wish. All the best to you and blessings for the future,Sincerely,Anita Ramsetty,MD",

    "question": "My husband was diagnosed with diabetes on March 29th.\u00a0\u00a0He went to the hospital unable to catch his breath.\u00a0\u00a0He had been up with stomach pains and vomiting the night before.\u00a0\u00a0He was in the ICU for 4 days with pancreatitis and ketoacidosis. His blood glucose was 754, triglycerides were 2100 and his cholesterol was about 600.\u00a0\u00a0He was very ill and I thought I was going to lose him.\u00a0\u00a0Within 24 hours of his admission into ICU his glucose levels were near normal and all of his numbers were coming down.\u00a0\u00a0He gives himself 3 shots of novolog (b4 meals) and 1 shot of lantus before bed.\u00a0\u00a0His glucose levels are pretty good.\u00a0\u00a0He has been home for 4 days and he is complaining of extreme fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0I think his body took a beating, but he is very discouraged with how tired he is.\u00a0\u00a0He is going back to work next Monday and I think he is very worried about his energy level.\u00a0\u00a0Is he expecting too much too soon?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
