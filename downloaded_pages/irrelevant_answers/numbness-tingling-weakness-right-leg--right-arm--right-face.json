            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.So assuming that spine MRI was clear, it is important to rule out neurological causes like MS and ALS in her case. I would suggest you to consult a neurologist for her as soon as possible and get a complete neurological exam done and also MRI of brain done.Other causes that need to be ruled out are peripheral neuropathies, muscular dystrophy and PAD (peripheral arterial disease) since she has a history of smoking.Please discuss all these possibilities with her treating doctor. Keep us posted!",

            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing back.Since both spine and brain MRI are clear, most of the neurological lesions like MS, ALS, brain tumors, nerve compression, and disc prolapse have been ruled out.It is important to rule out peripheral neuropathy due to B12 deficiency which can cause pernicious anemia and peripheral neuropathy.Diabetes can also cause peripheral neuropathy, PAD and muscle dystrophy also need to be considered and ruled out.",

    "question": "Please Help,My sister Debbie who is 49 years old has been affected with the following symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Her history is as follows:Female, 120lbs, SmokerMeds:\u00a0\u00a0Afrin 3 times Daily (25 years),\u00a0\u00a0Wal-tin daily (2 years),\u00a0\u00a0Tylenol Pm Nightly,\u00a0\u00a0Pantoprazole 120mg (1 1/2 years)1 1/2 years ago she started having floaters in her eyes and pink eye infections.\u00a0\u00a0Had laser surgery and docter placed her on tearing drops and drops for dry eyes and wal-tin for allergies.Eight weeks Deb started with the following problems:Numbness/tingling in her outer right leg from her knee to ancle.\u00a0\u00a0This start each day generally about after 10 minutes of being up and get progressively worse throughout the day.Numbness/tingling in her outer right arm from her elbow to her wrist. This start each day generally about after 30 minutes of being up and get progressively worse throughout the day.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes tingling and numbness moves into right hand.Numbness/tingling in her right side of face. This occus on some days and on other days its better.Difficulty picking up objects with her right hand facing down such as a purse or a pan due to what she calls a weakness is her right tricep muscle.\u00a0\u00a0Will experience a shooting pain in right tricep area if she tries to to pick up and object with hand facing down.\u00a0\u00a0Dropped a glass of milk yesterday due to lack of stregnth in right arm.Dificulty walking up stairs,\u00a0\u00a0feels as though right hip area does not have stregnth to lift her up the next step.Sitting at a desk and driving definately aggrivates her condition.\u00a0\u00a0Most comfortable when lying down or standing up.Recently she had a neck and spine MRI and several blood tests.Docter said she is borderline anemic and wants her to take naproxen as a possible preventative measure if arthritis is the cause of the tingling, numbness and muscle weakness although the doctor has not confirmed a diagnosis of arthrits.Beacuse of her past stomach problems that the Pantoprazole 120mg (1-1/2 years) is controlling well, she is hesitant to try the naproxen as the warnings say this very bad for the stomach.Any sugestions or ideas it would be apppreciated as we our concerned that the doctor so far seem to be stumped.Thank YouThis discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/296194\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/296194</a>.",
