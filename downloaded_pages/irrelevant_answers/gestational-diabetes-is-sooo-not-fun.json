            "answer": "Wow 10 lbs naturally, you're awesome! But I'm sure it was a healthy 10 lb baby so it's all good. My little one weighs 11 oz right now. I'm hoping she grows to be a healthy weight. I know you said your little prince is growing a little faster than the average...any idea how much he weighs right now? I have no clue where we should be with all of this because although everything looked normal with my little girl, she was measuring about a week behind. :)",

    "question": "Well I went to my Dietician/MD and they put my on insulin injections today I am sooo bummed. I have to do 3 injections a day, I was hoping to keep my levels down with diet but my fasting keeps coming up high. On a positive I've only gained 3 pounds this pregnancy which the MD says is fine since I needed to drop 30 to begin with. lol",
