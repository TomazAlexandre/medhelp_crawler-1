            "answer": "The amount of tea being consumed can be a contributor of weight gain based on empty calories and zero nutrional value. The corn syrup is a sweetner that is proving to have ill effects in non-pregnant women. Finally one of the most difficult things I am finding in my experience is getting in enough water. Tea has caffein which causes dehydration and counter productive to staying hydrated. I agree with the previous poster that making your own, consider decaf, may offer you the same option of having sweet tea but with the amount of natural sugar controlled. All the best!!!",
