            "answer": "Vitamin D can be lowered by other hormones - for instance, cortisol. And that can cause fatigue, osteoporosis. pain, and the memory issues. It also causes depression. It also depresses the thyroid.So it may not be PTH, but another hormone, or another cause entirely.Have you had all your hormones checked?",

    "question": "Is it possible to have parathroid disease if your serum calcium and PTH are normal. For 4 years I have had a low Vit D\u00a0\u00a0and even while taking 50,000 units a week my level is 21. I also have bone problems and my teeth are slowly dissolving away. I have unbearable joint pain (arthryalgias) and myalgia, tinnitus, bedridden often due to fatigue, difficulty concentrating and poor memory. All this has caused depression especially since I'm basically alone with no friend or family support. A year ago I started\u00a0\u00a0CaEDTA IV therapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy which helped some of my memory problems but not any other improvement and what seems like an increased numbness and tingling in my hands and feet. The serum calcium was done recently and I wondered if the chelation therapy had lowered the calcium level which in turn effected the PTH level. I also take Synthroid for Hypothroidism and had ovarian cancer in 1981. Please someone help me. I know others have worse problems but I can't stand the pain any more.",
