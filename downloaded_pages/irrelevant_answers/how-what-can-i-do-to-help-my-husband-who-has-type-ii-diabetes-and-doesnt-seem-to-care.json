            "answer": "Unfortunately, it is very hard to help someone who doesn't want to help themselves. If you nag too much you can even become the \"enemy\". One sentence that might influence him is the one at the end about you(and your children) needing him around. You could even try an intervention with the whole family where everyone tells him what he means to them and how much this is worrying/hurting them.The other issue I see from your post is that you mentioned he suffers from depression. This is very common with diabetes. Has he been diagnosed? Is he being treated? Depression impacts motivation, and your husband does indeed sound like he feels managing his diabetes is an impossible task and he has given up. If his depression is treated he may have the energy and motivation to deal with getting healthy and managing his diabetes. I strongly recommend having him see someone for medication and therapy if he is willing (which will also, of course, touch on his diabetes management).If your husband likes being online, send me a PM and I will give you a website with a lot more diabetics of both types successfully managing their diabetes (and also some loved ones whose perspective you can share). Best of luck to you.",

            "answer": "Hi hon, I am a type 1 diabetic and while I cannot say I've been through this with a spouse, I have gone through it with a parent who was type 2. It just seems like there should be something that would get through to your husband but as\u00a0\u00a0you said, with your child you would have a bit of control that you cannot have with a spouse. I would just encourage him to check his blood sugar 1st thing in the morning. It's hard for your husband to make changes in his diet and lifestyle if he isn't SEEING those high numbers himself...I know you cannot make him do this but do try to hon. Once he starts monitoring his sugar if even only once a day and sees for himself that healthy habits must start-and soon, maybe that will be enough to nudge him in the right directions. With my parent who didn't take care of himself, I talked to him, but eventually his unhealthy lifestyle ended him up in the hospital... then he made changes.",

            "answer": "That's good that your husband is seeing a psychiatrist. They are more knowledgeable to find the right medication at the right dose for an individual. Tell him to hang in there because that may make a big difference for him. Another option might be to ask him how he would feel about your coming to one session with him and his counselor where he or she can help you talk with each other about his diabetes.You hang in there too. I have to bite my tongue with my friends who are Type 2's and don't take good care. I can only imagine if it was my husband how I would feel. I'm also a type 1 and we don't have any choice; if we don't take care of our diabetes we could die.",

    "question": "Hello,My husband was told he had type II Diabetes about 2 1/2 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0He didn't seem to take it seriously.\u00a0\u00a0At that time he was working out and the doctor said if he keep working out and just watched what he ate he'd be able to control it without meds.\u00a0\u00a0But he quit working out, he suffers from depression as well as panic attacks.\u00a0\u00a0He has gain about 30 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor put him on pills to help keep his sugar in check, but he never tests his blood and now the doctor has told him if he doesn't get this in check he will be put on needles.\u00a0\u00a0Since then he seems to be delibratly eating all the wrong stuff.\u00a0\u00a0He doesn't portion control.\u00a0\u00a0He eats big bowls of ice cream and eats sweets all the time.\u00a0\u00a0I try to cook only enough food for everyone to have the right protions so there are no left overs but that isn't working either because he just raids the fridge or cupboards.\u00a0\u00a0I don't buy sweets or ice cream anymore, so he goes out and comes home with it.\u00a0\u00a0Also he gets those ice cappacinos which are a big cup of sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I'm at my wits end and don't know what to do.\u00a0\u00a0I can't make him eat right like I could if it was one of my children.\u00a0\u00a0We have 4 kids, 2 that are grow and out of the house and 2 at home (11 yr old daughter and a 3 yr old son).\u00a0\u00a0I need him around and it seems like he doesn't care.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone else gone through this with a spouse?\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions on how or what I can do to help him would be great appreciated.",
