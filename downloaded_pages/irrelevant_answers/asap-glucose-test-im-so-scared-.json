    "question": "So Friday was my first appointment... I'm only 8 weeks. They did lab work on everything for me including a glucose test. They didn't have me fast tho...they gave me an orange drink and waited an hour then took my blood. Today I get a call saying my doctor needs me to fast after dinner then go to the lab early in the morning and do a 3 hour test but I could be there for 4 hours... I'm so scared. Does that mean they found something wrong???",
