            "answer": "Sorry about your pain. Ive personally not ever heard of this in relation to diabetes. Do you have other signs of diabetes? You can search diabetes and get a list of general symptoms associated with diabetes. Most people Ive know with diabetes have pretty clear signs of their sugar being high or low but not heard of palm pain. I have diabetic neuropathy in my hands and it is mostly numbness tigling and some pain but in my lil fingers. Id give your doc a call and get appointment to do sugar test for diabetes if your worried. Hope you feel better soon. Daisy",
