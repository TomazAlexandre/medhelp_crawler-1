            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The smell, the fever and your other symptoms are due to sinusitis. The sinus needs to drain well for the infection to subside. So, you will need to consult an ENT specialist. More so because you are a diabetic. In the meantime take OTC naproxen for relief from pain, practice good breathing exercises, humidify your room and do steam inhalations.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
