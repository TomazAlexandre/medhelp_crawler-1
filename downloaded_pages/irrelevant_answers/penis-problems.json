            "answer": "Hi,How are you? If you are referring to the glans of the penis, the bulbous area at the end of the penis which includes the urethral opening, I recommend you consult a urologist to see why the area is \"wrinkled\". Typically, the glans is smooth and unwrinkled.If, however, you are referring to the area where the foreskin attaches to the end of the penis just before the glans, it is normal for that area to look \"wrinkled\". The extra folds of skin allow the penis to stretch during an erection in the aroused state.In the circumcised penis, the glans is easily visible at any time since enough of the foreskin has been removed and no longer covers the end of the penis. In the uncircumcised penis, the foreskin folds over and covers the glans and the end of the penis looks \"wrinkled\". If this is what you are referring to, this is typically a normal appearanceAlso, certain medical conditions like diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia can affect the libido and there by ejaculatory dysfunction can occur.I would suggest that you visit a urologist for further assistance.Best.",

    "question": "Hello, I am 30 years of age, and a type 1 diabetic. I have a circumcised penis. Over the last 5 years, my strength and duration of erection has lapsed, and it it now almost non-existant. Also, the head of my penis and the shaft too have developed deep wrinkles, and the penis has retreated into my body, so that my erect penis and my flaccid penis are now much smaller than they used to be. I have tried viagra and cialis and I have no real improvements. Also, since my circumcision [when I was 22], my penis has curved to the right when erect. Why did these wrinkles occur, and is there anything that I can do to reverse the whole bad situation?This discussion is related to/posts/show/225691.",
