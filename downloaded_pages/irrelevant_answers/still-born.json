And this pregnacy and the last I have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I know the risks (I'm doing all I'm can do to keep it under control)But I'm very never had a doctor say that to me. Trust me, my first gyno was as dry as a cracker and horrible with bedside manner. and I'm very had to hear \"because she has extra fat you have to sew this way\" during my c section.I just think that was in poor taste. You don't need to stress and have that looming over your head.",

I have already gained about 24 lbs and I have been beating myself up over it. But what am I going to do? None of us are going to be loosing until after these babies come out ! So we might as well give ourselves just as much love as we would our children. We can worry about the rest later!",

But tons of \"overweight\" women get pregnant and have perfectly healthy babies all the time just like there are women who are an \"ideal weight\" who can still end up with a still born. Don't let it get to you hun",

So 2x a week I will be at the Dr. Doing the test on Monday and then an ultrasound on Thursday. I am very nervous and scared. But then I'm not, I just don't want to stress and have my baby boy stress also. Its hard it really is, I mean I live in Arizona its sssooooo hot so I drink plenty of water and eat. But at times I get full so quickly.",

            "answer": "The fact that he told you that is pure stupidity. As a medical professional I can assure you were are not trained to be so heartless. First of all these risks should have been laid out to you at your first appt. And it should have been made clear that it could be an issue but doesn't mean at all that it will be an issue. Second, in response to your reply. Drinking water is of course essentially important. As far as eating alot of women experience this issue including myself. Weight has nothing to do with it. Keep taking those prenatals, and try adding fruit and vegetable juices to what your already drinking. They contain a ton of vitamins and calories that you do still need to intake with out the heaviness of an actual meal.fruit such as watermelon and peaches, are splendid in the summer and help keep you hydrated. And please despite what anyone else may suggest. Now is not the time to diet. Eat sensably yes, diet no. And again I apologize for your rude practioners behavior. If he continues to act so rudely maybe you might benefit from changing to a new one.",
