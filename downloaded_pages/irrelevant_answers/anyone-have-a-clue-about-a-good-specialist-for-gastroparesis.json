            "answer": "I have the same problem but thank god I have the weight to lose. I'm very sorry about your husband. I recently had a feeding tube place after my stomach so I can feed myself through out the day. It sounds to me like he needs the Mayo clinic or something High tech. You really need to do some research online there are names of dr's out there that deal with this issue. I have found a good one he managed my care well up until recently. Now he has no idea what to do. His options are out. So I am requesting to go back to Mayo clinic here in florida. I would do alot of looking online. I'm doing the same myself. I had a gastric pacer implanted last year. It helped great for 1 year. Best Year I had in a long time. It recently stopped working for me but I don't regreat getting it. I hope some os this helps. email me back if you need it. Good luck",
