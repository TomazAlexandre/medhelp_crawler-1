            "answer": "Yeah. I had an eye exam at four or five months. She pretty much told me that it would be a waste to try getting new glasses until after I deliver because pregnancy does affect eyesight. Luckily she said my eyes weren't affected to much at the time and I didn't need a prescription yet anyway. Now I feel like I do, but still have to wait. She did advise against use of my allergy eye drops though, since they are in the unknown category as far as pregnancy goes. Instead just to use tears over the counter to cleanse the allergens from my eyes as needed.",
