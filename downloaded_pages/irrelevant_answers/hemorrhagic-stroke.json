            "answer": "Hi, for haemorrhagic strokes, the focus is on controlling the bleeding and reducing the pressure on the brain. Sometimes surgical interventions may be needed to control the bleeding. And also controlling high risk factors like diabetes and hypertension. Depending on the area of brain affected she would have manifested the symptoms. With control of high risk factors and rehabilitation, she is likely to improve. Good luck with her recovery. Regards.",
