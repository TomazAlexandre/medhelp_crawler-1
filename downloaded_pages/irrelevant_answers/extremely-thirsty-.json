            "answer": "I have the same problem, it's like if I don't drink all day every minute I have cotton mouth..it's that bad. And I drink almost 100oz+ per day! I told my Ob and she said baby is just asking for more, and even though I drink enough, I have no choice but to drink more. I just started mixing my drinks up more. I find drinking hot tea helps some, but then when I'm done drinking I still drink water. I just actually tried sucking hard candy so that I'm keepping saliva generating and it helps so I'm not always running for water...but there isn't a solution I don't think..only thing to do is drink. And I'm 26wks..water is my bff lol",

I was told excessive thirst could be a sign of gestational diabetes...just keep very well-hydrated, gd is hard to diagnose with just this single symptom, so i wouldnt worry just yet but mention it to your midwife.",
