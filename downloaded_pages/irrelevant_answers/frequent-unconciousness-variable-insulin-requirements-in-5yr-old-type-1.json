    "question": "Hi, my 5 yr old son was diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes approximately two and a half years ago. He has, over the past 2-3 months become incredibly unstable with frequent hypoglycaemic episodes, resulting in loss of consciousness. There are a number of factors which may be influencing this,(?sickness, exercise,rapid metabolism of NPH, glycogen depletion?). He had a flu type illness a few weeks ago and his insulin requirements dropped to about half for several days( He has always required less during illness). He was admitted to hospital the following week to attempt stabilisation, but despite significant reductions in insulin dosing he managed several hypos. (We were however, charging around the grounds, playing games, and I had no idea at the time how much exercise affected blood sugars and reduced insulin requirements over the next 24 hours). He was also not eating as freely as he might at home.Eventually the insulin was cut back to such an extent that he swung into DKA which made him very sick. I have also noticed that following severe hypos treated with glucagon that he always has another rapid BS drop within a few hours, and that his insulin requirements drop sharply for 1-2 days. 3 days ago his BS was 5.4mmol/L (98) when I checked, and 15 mins later he behaved strangely and said he felt low. His BS was 1.6 (28) and 60 seconds later he was unconscious. This is typical of what is happening. Could a cycle of glycogen depletion be a contributory factor in variable insulin requirements and sensitivity? Any ideas?",
