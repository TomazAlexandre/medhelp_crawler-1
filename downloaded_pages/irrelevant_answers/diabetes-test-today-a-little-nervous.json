            "answer": "Actually you are not to fast with the one hour glucose test but you are to fast with the 3 hour. I had mine done Monday morning early and did not want to drink that nasty stuff on an empty stomach so I had buttered toast and a big glass of milk and was called yesterday to say I passed the test. You need to have a level under 140 and I was at 102. So I suggest eating something light.",
