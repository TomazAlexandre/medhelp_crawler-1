    "question": "Ok.. I had my 1 hr G diabetes test done Friday, August 29th & it didn't seem bad at all. My next appointment was on this Friday September 12th, but my doctor called me today and asked could I reschedule my appointment because my doctor wouldn't be in on Friday. It's crazy because there's more than 1 doctor in the facility and I don't have a set doctor. When I asked her about my results, she just told me that I'll find out tomorrow. Now I'm worried & mad because she could have told me.",
