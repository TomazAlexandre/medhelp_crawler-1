            "answer": "I cannot make a diagnosis without reviewing the films. Tumors typically have a different appearance on MRI when compared to MS lesions. If you are concerned I would encourage you to ask your neurologist this question, and perhaps request a second radiologist to review the films. Good luck.",

I have M.S..\u00a0\u00a0Some of these neurological problems just take a very long time to figure out.\u00a0\u00a0In the mean time, I would suggest that you get on with your life as best you can.\u00a0\u00a0Theres no joy in feeling victemized by the uncertainty and often we imagine the worst, and the worst never actually comes to be. Speaking from experience over focus on your symptoms can sometimes make them feel worse and make you more miserable.",

    "question": "I am a 38 yr old female.\u00a0\u00a0I am overweight and was diagnosed with diabetes 2 yrs ago but blood sugar levels are well controlled/A1C never over 6.\u00a0\u00a0This past July I had severe back pain in my lower lft back.\u00a0\u00a0The pain went up my back and down my lft leg. Severe pain lasted a couple of days and then just regular pain for about a mth.\u00a0\u00a0Pain moved into lft hip and then lft thigh above knee & inside of thigh went numb. Lft leg was so weak I had to use railing to climb stairs.\u00a0\u00a0MRI on back showed nothing.\u00a0\u00a0Lft thigh remained numb so GP sent me to neuro.\u00a0\u00a0She mentioned MS and I told her I didn't have symptoms except fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0She sent me for brain MRI and did nerve conductivity test.\u00a0\u00a0While waiting for results I did some research on MS and started realizing I did have several of the symptoms and most of them at the same time my back started hurting.\u00a0\u00a0Aside from the numbness, I felt dizzy & lightheaded just sitting at my desk, some blurred vison. There were a few days in a row where when I picked up my soda can my hand would shake back and forth and I couldn't stop it. More leg cramps and stiffness than usual. I also had several issues of bladder urgency & difficulty controlling it. Noticed some problems with mental clarity also (hard to describe it) Nerve conductivity test came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0MRI showed 1 lesion between frontal & parietal lobe/4 mm.\u00a0\u00a0Doc says doesn't think MS because only 1 and denser than MS lesion, doesn't think it's causing the numbness.\u00a0\u00a0Wants to wait 3 mths and do another MRI. Could it be a tumor?\u00a0\u00a0If so, is waiting 3 mths a good idea?",
