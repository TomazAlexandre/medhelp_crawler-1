            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.The MRI will be useful for evaluating for structural etiologies causing the epileptiform abnormalities. These may include vascular etiologies (such as strokes, vascular malformations, etc), parenchymal (such as abnormal brain development, regression of initially normal tissue, etc), and others.I agree your son should follow up with a pediatric neurologist. Was the EEG performed with minimal benzodiazepine? When was the EEG obtained with regards of the timing of the MRI? Many times, children are given sedation for the MRI which may be reflected on the EEG.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
