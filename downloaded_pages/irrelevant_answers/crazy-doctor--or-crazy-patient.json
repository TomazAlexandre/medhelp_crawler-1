            "answer": "Hi-just a volunteer, not a doctor, diabetic for 25 years.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest getting a second opionion. Any doctor who dismisses your thoughts and feelings doesn't sound like he/she is the best for you.\u00a0\u00a0I think you need to get blood drawn to have an accurate test for your blood sugar reading. 197 sounds too high-but may not be accurate, since being a volunteer on the site, I have discovered if there is a residue like orange juice on your hands it could effect your glucose reading. Your range should be somewhere between 80-110.\u00a0\u00a0I am not familiar with stomach pains and diabetes(which doesn't mean that it is not possible) but, feeling faint and extremely tired and thirsty, could certainly be signs of diabetes.Have you done more research about diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0You sound internet savvy, so try JDRF.org or the American Diabetes Association Website.",

    "question": "For a while now, I've been getting extreme stomach pains along with feeling numb in my hands and feet, feeling faint and actually fainting, being extremely tired, and drinking all the time. My mom was conserned about diabetes, because it runs in our family. She used a self-check glucose machine right after I woke up, and the blood sugar was 197. When I went to the doctor, he told me that was a normal reading, and the different symptoms are just a coincidense. He diagnosed me with irritable bowel syndrome, and sent me on my way. I researched IBS when I got home, and I have none of those symptoms. Are the symptoms and the 197 glucose level something to be conserned about? Or am I overreacting, and my doctor's probably right?",
