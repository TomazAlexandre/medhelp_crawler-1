            "answer": "Hello,The burning sensations can be due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the burning is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a doctor as it can be due to some neurological disorder. For the moles on scrotum , angiokeratoma needs to be ruled out. For this I suggest you to consult a dermatologist.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
