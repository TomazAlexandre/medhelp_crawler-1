So very excited!\u00a0\u00a0We never thought to be able to be parents, due to a low sperm count and me having constant problems as well (infections and such)If I can offer support/ advice or even a open ear, I am more that happy to do that. It's important to know that you aren't alone, when problems arise and that there are people who care and can relate.regardKim",
