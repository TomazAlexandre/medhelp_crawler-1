            "answer": "I'm sure that after two months with no meds, you must not be feeling well at all.\u00a0\u00a0You cannot continue this.\u00a0\u00a0You will just feel worse and worse.\u00a0\u00a0I'd suggest contacting the manufacturer of your meds.\u00a0\u00a0They often have programs to help \"if you can't afford your medication\". Also, relatively speaking, thyroid meds are pretty inexpensive.\u00a0\u00a0Another trick to make them even cheaper is to ask your doctor to prescribe double your dose and take half each day.\u00a0\u00a0The double dose usually is not much more expensive than the single, and it goes twice as long (of course, you can't do this if you take any meds with T3 in them).If there's any way you can possibly swing it, you really should have FT3, FT4 and TSH tested after two months off meds to see where you are.Since you have no thyroid, meds are not optional.\u00a0\u00a0You have to find a way to continue meds as this is probably the most important thing in your life right now.\u00a0\u00a0Any other corner you can cut on expenses is preferable.No OTC meds sold in the U.S. can contain thyroid hormones, so there is nothing to replace prescription meds.\u00a0\u00a0Anything you might find that purports to would probably be as expensive as your prescription.",

            "answer": "Since you have no T-gland it's not a good idea to be without levoxyl and there\u2019s nothing you can get OTC that would even come close to it and would even cost you more money than the levoxyl which may even be cheaper than anything you can find OTC.Ask your pharmacy how much it would be without insurance it is a generic so that helps.You can also look for one of those discount cards they can really help I use HealthTrans the card is freehttp://www.pathtobettercare.com/Pages/GetCard.aspxYou can also transfer your prescription to a walmart and get a 3 month supply.I hope this helps Good Luck to you",

            "answer": "I agree with the other posters that you really\u00a0\u00a0need to get back on thyroid meds. I am currently in my 3rd bout with thyroid cancer and once you have had a TT if your levels drop enough (not sure of amounts) you can go into what is called a \"thyroid storm\". Personally I do not have alot of knowledge of this I only know what some nurses have told me and it can lead to a coma and possible death they said. I do recommend that you talk to your Dr. about the generic because at walmart (depending on your dosage) a months supply is only 4 to 9 dollars. And truthfully this is cheaper than any natural supplement containing bovine thyroid hormones.",
