            "answer": "Hi... I just posted some web resources about this to your other question, but here's my 2 cents:The big problem with both the GI and GL are that there are too many variables involved in how the numbers were figured out, which for the GI basically was force feeding a bunch of people a food item, measuring their blood sugars, and then averaging that number against what their blood sugar was when given pure glucose... well, we're assuming all those people had no insulin or blood sugar issues to begin with, but who knows, and even if they didn't, can we then apply that data to people who do have diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0 Plus, it's all a statistical analysis... which reminds me of my favorite quote on that subject:\u00a0\u00a0\"Statistics are like bikinis; what they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.\"But, I think there is some value, especially in looking at what foods have BOTH a high-gi *and* a high-gl, as a starting point and general guideline in what foods to avoid and which might be ok... for example, carrots have a high GI because their carbs break down quickly into sugar, but carrots don't have a lot of carbs so they have a surprisingly much lower GL...\u00a0\u00a0and given the vitamins and fiber in carrots, I'm willing to try adding some carrots to my diet and see what they do to *my* blood sugars.And there's the bottom line... the only way to know what works for you is to figure it out for yourself.\u00a0\u00a0It's annoying and time consuming and expensive (because of the test strips), but for a week or two keep a food diary of everything you eat and your blood sugar readings before and after eating... it's really the only way to figure out what will work best for you.",

            "answer": "I have lost weight successfully following the glycemic index. It makes sense for diabetics to avoid those foods high on thethe index. I am not as familiar with glycemic load. There are so many good choices in carbs that are low on the index. It is just common sense\u00a0\u00a0to avoid the simple carbs that increase blood sugar levels rapidly.",

    "question": "I would be interested in anyone's opinion on the ongoing debate over the validity of the gycemic index versus the glycemic load.It seems that the proponents of both camps strongly decry the criticisms from the other side.I understand that the ADA does not endorse the concept of glycemic load--My doctor thinks it's all baloney.How seriously should anyone use the data from either study when planning a safe diet for diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0 Thanx",
