            "answer": "Hi there!Loss of sensation or numbness need not always occur secondary to diabetes. Other possibilities of neuropathy that may need to be considered include nutrient deficiencies, metabolic issues, injuries/ trauma, metabolic causes, heavy metal poisoning, medication side effect etc. I would suggest getting this evaluated by a primary care physician initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
