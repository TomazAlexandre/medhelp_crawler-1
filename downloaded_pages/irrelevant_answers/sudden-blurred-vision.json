    "question": "I am 34, exercise regularly, don't smoke, don't do drugs, eat fairly healthy.\u00a0\u00a0Two months ago I had a sudden episode of blurred vision, crossed eyes and couldn't see for 1 minute.\u00a0\u00a0I went and was tested for diabetes and also went to an eye doctor who checked my optic nerve.\u00a0\u00a0They found nothing.\u00a0\u00a0The eye doctor mentioned that it could be eye strain.\u00a0\u00a0I did just recently get a new job where I spend more time at my desk staring at my computer so I dismissed it as eye strain. A few days ago I was in a department store with my daughter and suddenly my eyes became very sensitive to light and my vision became blurry again, I could still see for the most part but it was very difficult.\u00a0\u00a0I couldn't focus and my peripheral vision was very blurry and wavy.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't feel dizziness in both cases.\u00a0\u00a0I'm set to see a neurologist in a few days but I'm very worried that this could be something very serious.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have experience with this sort of thing?",
