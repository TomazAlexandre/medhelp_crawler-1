            "answer": "Hm, have you had a cardiac work up?\u00a0\u00a0I am sure that your doctors aren't morons but rather you are not presenting with easily to determine cause from symptoms.Agree that dehydration can cause this and one doesn't have to exercise to experience that.\u00a0\u00a0You could be having a reaction to sugar or a reaction to no food.\u00a0\u00a0You could be having a panic attack (yes, those symptoms are associated with panic attacks).\u00a0\u00a0You could be having a neurological problem.So, I'd have a cardiac work up first to rule out that end, then see a neurologist, then to a general practitioner for a blood work up regarding diabetes/sugar levels/hypoglycemia and finally a mental health professional for anxiety.good luck",
