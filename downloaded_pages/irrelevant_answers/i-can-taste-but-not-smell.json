            "answer": "Thank you Arti dharma. Actually, I told this to my current physician and he did my allergy tests. It was shown that\u00a0\u00a0I am allergic to so many things and he told that this is one of a million cases. Now, I am taking my allergy liquid medication for about 6 months. I will make an appointment tomorrow and we will see whats next.. If I was given to ask for a single wish then it would be to recover sense of smell.",

    "question": "I still remember when I used to get up and I used to go to my fields and could smell everything.I don't know what might have happened that I kind of lost my sense of smell at the age of 20.I still remember that once my nose struck with a pillar while I was playing with kids and my eyes covered with a piece of cloth. that was a huge blow. My nose did not bleed but it was like a hell of a feeling. Then I don't know whether I lost my smell due to that incident or due to some other\u00a0\u00a0reason. my nose started to have blocked and then i had problem breathing. I did two nose surgeries. my nose is not perfect now cuz i can breath but i keep lying on my left side to keep my right nostril open and then can breath well. though breathing is not a problem now but I am wondering when will I get my smell\u00a0\u00a0back. ANY EXPERIENCE LIKE THAT?",
