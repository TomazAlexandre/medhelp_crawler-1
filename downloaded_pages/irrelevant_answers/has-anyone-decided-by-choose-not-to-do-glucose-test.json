I'm careful to watch what I eat and have never had a problem with any of my pregnancies. I know lots of moms on here don't agree with that and think it's important to take the test, but it's your baby and your decision.",

I ended up finding out I had gestational diabetes (with my son's pregnancy) . had I not taken the test, I would have continued to \"over eat\" and my son would have been born with an unhealthy weight. The funny thing is I'm a vegetarian (naturally eating healthy) and still ended up having gestational diabetes.my son was born 8lbs 10oz 20inches long and I'm 5'1. Had I not been watching what I was eating, I couldn't imagine how big he would have been.",
