I have had 3 major surgeries including laporotomy plus my right ovary removed they have left my left ovary as i am only 24 and i have non invasive implants which need to be observed and can only be removed through surgery. Plus PCOS and endometriosis and now type 2 diabetes which is meant to me common for women with hormonal probs and they are actually stidying a link betweenPCOS and OVCA so i was wondering if anyone knew how to treat PCOS to get the insulin resistance under control.",
