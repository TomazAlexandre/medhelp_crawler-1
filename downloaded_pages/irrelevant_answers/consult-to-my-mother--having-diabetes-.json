            "answer": "Hello,you need to get a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0it would appear that metformin is no longer an adequate treatment for her.The most appropriate treatment will be insulin.You need to get a second opinion from a doctor and find one who will treat her properly.Consider her FBS was 236.\u00a0\u00a0Normal FBS should be about 70 - 95 range.With uncontrolled diabetes she is at risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, which can be fatal.\u00a0\u00a0Please also control how much carbs she eats.\u00a0\u00a0But bottom line is that she needs a dr who will give her the correct medication (insulin at this point).",
