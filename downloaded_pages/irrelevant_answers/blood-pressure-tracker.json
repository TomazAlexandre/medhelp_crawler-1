            "answer": "Great suggestions. A number of these trackers are in our pipeline of new features. We'll let you know when they're live.We'll add some hypotension symptoms and treatments in the blood pressure tracker shortly.As for the heart rate tracker, are you looking to track this multiple times per day or just once per day? Is this something you want to measure at rest and during exercise?Thanks!",

    "question": "I'm happy that a blood pressure tracker has been implemented.\u00a0\u00a0This is very helpful to the Dysautonomia community, as most of us suffer episodes of extremely low blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0As it is, the blood pressure tracker seems to be geared toward those with high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0Would it be possible to expand upon the current blood pressure tracker to include symptoms (fainting, disorientation, etc.) and treatments (vasoconstrictors, stimulants, Florinef, etc.) of low blood pressure?A heart rate tracker was suggested at one point as well, perhaps this could be implemented within the blood pressure tracker.\u00a0\u00a0Unless there is some benefit in keep these trackers separate from one another.\u00a0\u00a0Just a thought.A hydration tracker might be helpful to the Dysautonomia community to track liquid intake (water, sports drinks, Pedialyte, PICC hydration treatments, etc.).\u00a0\u00a0I imagine that it would be somewhat useful to other communities as well, such as the fitness/dieting related communities here on Medhelp.Other ideas:- Blood Sugar Tracker (possibly beneficial to the Dysautonomia and Diabetes communities)- Body Temperature Tracker (possibly beneficial to the Dysautonomia and Thyroid communities.)",
