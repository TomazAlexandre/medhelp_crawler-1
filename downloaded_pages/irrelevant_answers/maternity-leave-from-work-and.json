            "answer": "I definitly agree with the others and say that you shouldn't be lifting ppl at 32 wks. I know exactly what you mean about the money and not wanting to go on maternity leave until absolutely neccessary. I'm 31 wks and am worried that i won't get to work all the way through, and i don't know what i'll do, b/c i don't have enough PTO time to cover myself if i have to go out before and after the baby is born. But you can definitly hurt yourself or maybe even make labor come on by trying to lift a full grown person, and since your body is letting you know by you hardly being able to lift a person you use to be able to lift i think you should definitly think about maternity leave!I also have gestational diabetes.",

            "answer": "You definitely should not be lifting people during any stage of pregnancy. I understand it is part of the job but you have special needs during your pregnancy and your job is responsible to ensure you have a safe working environment. Talk with your doctor about this. They can give you a note with restrictions and your job has to work with you on this.Good luck!",

I asked him about when I should start thinking about maternity leave at the appt before last and alls he said was \"There's no recipe for that right now.\" So, I'm not counting on him for any sound advice on it... actually my work told me yesterday that I need to get things situated so I can take it... maybe not this week, they said but SOON...",

I decided y'all were absolutely right, I'm now officially on maternity leave, just that fast-I think my work realized that I was a bit of a potential liability for them and that's prolly why they were pushing the M.L. quite a bit. :-) (They didn't force me to take it, they just advised me to) lol",
