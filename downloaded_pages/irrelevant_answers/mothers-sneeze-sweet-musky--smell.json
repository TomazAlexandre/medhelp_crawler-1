    "question": "I am asking this on behalf of my mother.She is forty one years old,perfectly healthy and physically fit.When she sneezes,a very sweet,musky smell is emitted.It can be described as floral or honey like.Its not bad at all.The smell is strong and lingers for a bit,and can be smelled from several feet away also.Its not genetic because no one else in her family has this.Some experts say that tonsils,sinusitis or diabetes could cause this but my mother does not suffer from any of these conditions.Just to let you know,my mother has\u00a0\u00a0a wet sneeze,with a lot of mist and spray emitted in it.Thanks.",
