            "answer": "It's bad but you'll get through it. This time last year I was 36weeks pregnant with my daughter.. I had a difficult pregnancy.. eg migraines..sciatica and gestational diabetes right to the end. I know how you feel and its natural. But time will fly. You will go through pain I won't lie but you forget the pain when you hold you baby in your arms for the first time. It's all worth it I promise. I have an eleven month old daughter and I'm nine weeks with baby number two. Just remember billions of women give birth.. and go on to do it again. Some do it many times. So yes its bad but not bad enough to stop us having more. You'll be fine.. you'll surprise yourself at how strong you are :) we are designed to give birth. All the best Hon xx",
