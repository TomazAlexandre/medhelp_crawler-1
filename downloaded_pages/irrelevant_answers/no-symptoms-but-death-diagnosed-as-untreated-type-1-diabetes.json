            "answer": "I am so sorry for your friend's devastating loss. The facts you give here aren't normal for diabetics -- when diagnosed, we normally do not have high blood cells or low platelets. However, if a person has been diabetic for a while and the diabetes is not controlled by insulin, other health problems can arise. For instance, I was diagnosed after a severe bout of scarlet fever. Bacteria thrive in uncontrolled diabetic people because the high sugar levels help breed bacteria. So many of us do develop secondary problems that send us to the doctor, and then find out that the root problem is diabetes that made our bodies succumb to the secondary problems. I was 12 when diagnosed, and my identical twin was checked and diagnosed at the same time. I can look back and remember that some of the symptoms were present, but nothing that my parents would have noticed at all. They\u00a0\u00a0had no idea that anything was wrong, for many 12 year old kids are sort of coltish and thin, eat a lot, etc. As for the drinking lots of water, I remember doing this, but my parents never saw it or noticed it.So she could have had some symptoms that just weren't obvious yet to anybody. It develops slowly enough most of the time that the symptoms increase slowly and for a long time can seem just like normal kid behavior.The real killer in this situation appears to have been the bacteria that made her sick. There is a link if being diabetic made her susceptible to it.",

            "answer": "that statement is not true about 140 for a normal person. I have seen elderly persons that are perfectly normal with blood sugars of 200 after eating. This girl did not die with diabetes unless her blood sugars were elevated above the 7oo range for an extended period of time. An hbga1c would determine that at autopsy. She would be severely dehydrated and urinating constantly early on. Very easy to determine cause of death in this case because it was not instant.",

    "question": "A friend just lost her daughter this weekend and the diagnosis was untreated type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0We are all stunned because she had NO common symptoms - NO unusual thirst; NO frequent urination; NO unexplained or rapid weight loss; NO lethargy, or fluctuations in body temp (feeling hot, or clammy, or chilled);\u00a0\u00a0The only indication that she was not feeling well was a headache that came and went over that past week.\u00a0\u00a0She also felt mildly nauseated, but this was not persistent and was not severe.\u00a0\u00a0These symptoms started on Monday, the 8th.\u00a0\u00a0Around 4 am on Sat the 13th she woke up with a severe headache.\u00a0\u00a0Her parents gave her some pain reliever which she immediately started vomited.\u00a0\u00a0the vomiting persisted for a while, until she finally fell asleep.\u00a0\u00a0A couple of hours later, when checked on, she was unresponsive.\u00a0\u00a0911 was called. She quit breathing before the ambulance could get there.\u00a0\u00a0They were able to restore breathing but before she reached the hospital she began \"bleeding out\" (cerebral hemorrhage?) At the hospital the CBC showed extremely high white blood cell levels and NO platelets.\u00a0\u00a0She was pronounced a few hours later.Is this consistent with diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Can you be symptom free and then suddenly crash so quickly that you are dead within hours?",
