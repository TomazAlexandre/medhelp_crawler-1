            "answer": "I had mine done early as well since they found glucose in my urine, turns out I was diabetic and now have to take Insulin. Its kind of annoying but you just have to excersize and watch what you eat.(ideally what you should do anyway) and I think its better to have the test done early cause if you do have high blood sugar its safer for the baby to get it under control quickly.",

            "answer": "It's good to have it done early if they are worried already about gestational diabetes. Although, it can develop in a matter of weeks and usually later on in pregnancy, I would just give you the advice to request a second testing later on in pregnancy if the first one comes back normal!",
