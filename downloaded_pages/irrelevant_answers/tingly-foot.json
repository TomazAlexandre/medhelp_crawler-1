            "answer": "Hi lemma,first of all let me congratulate you on your incredible effort and success in losing weight and controlling your blood sugars! It is by no means an easy task. You should be very proud of yourself.With that said, I also have to mention that I am a volunteer on this forum, living with Type I diabetes for the past 12 years, and I'm not a medical professional.The symptoms you are describing could, but don't have to be, associated with diabetic neuropathy. Best way to make sure is to check with your doctor. You can also try checking your sugar when you're experiencing these symptoms. I have had sensations of heat in my feet lately and was also worried about neuropathy so I asked my endocrinologist and that's what she advised me to do, before I become more concerned. Sometimes low sugar can trigger these symptoms as well. Or it could be the excercise. Please speak with your doctor about your concerns. It will make you feel better to know for sure. And keep up the great work!",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for your wonderful advice AND words of encouragement. I will definitely take your advice and check my blood sugar tonight when I do my \"walk\". If I'm lucky though it won't happen again! It will be hard to stop and do the check, but it's such a good idea-I'll HAVE to do it! It should be interesting to see what it is. Reading others posts on this webiste has made me realize perhaps I should be seeing an endocrinologist as opposed to my regular GP that I'm seeing now. Thanks again for your help. This is a great tool. I'll be telling my friends about it. Lemma",

My blood sugar averages 95-120, my Metformin has been decreased. I eat 45 carbs per meal. I'm doing well & feeling better than ever. I \"walk\" 3 miles every day using an In-Home Walking tape. Lately when I do this low impact aerobics, I get a tingling or numb sensation in my left foot. I loosened my shoe, but it continued. Do I have the beginning of neuropothy?
