How about \"Until the Next Teardrop Falls\" another one of his hits. He sure got a lot done in his like for someone who had a lot he was dealing with. I was glad they mentioned HCV as a contribution. Often times it is not mentioned and as you said Eyedeas it most likely is one of the starting points for some of his ailments. Drug/alcohol abuse was a contributor too but he rehabbed in the early 80's I read. In spite of his struggles with a lot of illness and addiction issues, he rocked and accomplished a lot in his life. He got thrown in Angola for 3 years for a couple joints. His real name was Baldemar G. Huerta.Descanse En Paz",

Since he was transplanted for kidney and liver he was almost certainly taking anti-rejction meds and that increases the risk of cancer. I don't think we can separate HCV out of the equation. But with as many issues as Freddy had it might be pushing it to say that hepatitis was the cause of his death. Mike",
