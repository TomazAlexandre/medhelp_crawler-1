            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Head pulsing could also be due to a myoclonus secondary to ear infection. Another reason for head pulsing is peripheral neuropathy (diabetes, thyroid problems, lupus etc) or pinched nerve in neck (MRI or nerve conduction studies or EMGs would be diagnostic). It can also be a carotid artery pulsing with high blood pressure. Another possibility is severe sleep deprivation. Please consult your doctor regarding this as soon as you can. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
