            "answer": "Hi Andy,I agree with AnnieBrooke. Try getting a urine sample--Ugh! not easy . I must have followed my cat for days trying to catch her peeing. She was becoming paranoid, but I think I was just too obvious. The box with the little black beads went with me every time\u00a0\u00a0I saw her go into her box room.She kept looking at me as if to say \" Really???? WTH is your problem\"The new kitten can cause stress. Cats Hate change. That just will take some time until they get used to each other. Try and keep separate litter boxes and if possible keep them separated so they can gradually get accustomed to each other.\u00a0\u00a0Each should. have their own room for a while with food, water, box and toysStay in touch with your vet if anything changes. You have done the right thing by consulting with him.Good Luck,CML",

It's just the clump size that is worrying me because they were so big like tennis balls almost and now there are multiple ones the size of a avocado seed. I've been looking things up online and I think that has made me even more anxious because I'm terrified his kidneys might be the problem :( thanks for responding",

The cats may also decide to pee elsewhere to show you.\u00a0\u00a0(or they may be afraid of their box since they relate it to pain).\u00a0\u00a0Pooba ended up totally blocked and to unblock was $1,000!!\u00a0\u00a0I agree with others that the vet needs a sample and some meds issued before it get's worse.\u00a0\u00a0Pooba was then fine.\u00a0\u00a0He had a huge fear of his box (due to the pain he related to it) but I was fortunate he would go if I went with him an watched! (yes, for SEVERAL years later I had to \"take\" him pee but it worked!)\u00a0\u00a0WE do many crazy things for our pets. He finally goes all by himself again.

    "question": "So recently I noticed my 2 year old male cat going to the litter box often. When he goes the clumps are about the size of a walnut. Usually they are a lot bigger. I noticed this after we got a new female kitten that he started going more often. I took him to the vet and they said that his bladder was empty so they couldn't check forInfection which they thought wouldn't be there since he emptied it. They injected him with anti inflammatory medicine and with water under his skin. Since then he has made trips to the litter box often but the size in the clumps increased drastically but with some smaller ones. He is acting the sameAs he usually does and the\u00a0\u00a0vet didn't seem too concerned. Do you think the stress o a new kitten is what's causing this? I don't want to give away the kitten but I don't want to jeopardize his health. Please help",
