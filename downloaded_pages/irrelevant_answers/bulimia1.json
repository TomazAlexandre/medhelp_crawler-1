            "answer": "I'm sorry to hear that your daughter is struggling.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, only your daughter can tell you why she is engaging in these behaviors.\u00a0\u00a0However, what I can address is your last two questions.\u00a0\u00a0You asked if individual's with Bulimia purge in their room or other locations and the answer is yes.\u00a0\u00a0Individual's suffering from Bulimia become very good at hiding their behaviors, in part due to guilt and sometimes because they know what they are doing would likely not be understood by loved ones.\u00a0\u00a0Those with Bulimia are typically ashamed of their eating problems and thus attempt to conceal their symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Binge eating usually occurs in secrecy and episodes may not be planned in advance.\u00a0\u00a0Binge eating often continues until the individual is uncomfortably, or even painfully, full and these episodes are often triggered by dysphoric (i.e., depressed) mood states, interpersonal stressors, intense hunger following strict restriction of caloric intake, or it may be related to body weight, body shape, and food.\u00a0\u00a0Binge eating may temporarily reduce depressed feelings, but disparaging self-criticism and depressed mood often follow.\u00a0\u00a0Often times, episodes of binge eating are accompanied by a sense of lack of control, especially early in the course of the disorder.\u00a0\u00a0The recurrent use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain is another essential feature of Bulimia.\u00a0\u00a0Many individuals with Bulimia employ several methods in their attempt to compensate for binge eating.\u00a0\u00a0The most common compensatory technique is self-induced vomiting after an episode of binge eating.\u00a0\u00a0The immediate effects of vomiting include relief from physical discomfort and reduction of fear of gaining weight.\u00a0\u00a0For some, vomiting becomes a goal in itself, and the person will binge in order to vomit or will vomit after eating a small amount of food.\u00a0\u00a0Individuals with Bulimia may use a variety of methods to induce vomiting, including the use of fingers or instruments to stimulate the gag reflex.\u00a0\u00a0Frequently, individuals become adept at inducing vomiting and are eventually able to vomit at will.\u00a0\u00a0Other types of purging behaviors include excessive use of laxatives and diuretics.\u00a0\u00a0Rarely, individuals with Bulimia will consume syrup of ipecac or misuse enemas following episodes of binge eating.\u00a0\u00a0They may fast for a day or more or exercise excessively in an attempt to compensate for their binge eating.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise may be considered excessive when it significantly interferes with important activities, occurs at inappropriate times or in inappropriate settings, or when the person continues to exercise despite injury or other medical complications.\u00a0\u00a0Rarely, individuals may take thyroid hormone to avoid weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0Those with Bulimia and diabetes mellitus (Type I diabetes) may omit or reduce insulin doses in order to reduce the metabolism of food consumed during eating binges.\u00a0\u00a0Individuals with Bulimia place an excessive emphasis on body shape and weight in their self-evaluation, and these factors are typically the most important in determining self-esteem.\u00a0\u00a0Individuals with Bulimia may closely resemble those with Anorexia in their fear of gaining weight, desire to lose weight, and level of dissatisfaction with their bodies.\u00a0\u00a0There are two different subtypes of Bulimia: Purging Type (the person regularly engages in self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas during the current episode) or Nonpurging Type (the person has used other inappropriate compensatory behaviors, such as fasting or excessive exercise, but has not regularly engaged in self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas during the current episode).\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms of depression are commonly seen in individuals with Bulimia as well.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this information is helpful and feel free to ask me any additional questions you might have.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you, your daughter, and your family!",

            "answer": "Thank you for your response!This has been a very long process for us and we've expressed to her that we want to help her and get her healthy again but she doesn't seem interested.\u00a0\u00a0 All she tells us is that it's her body and that her body is none of our business.\u00a0\u00a0 (True to a point but when her health is involved, we must do something).The other night we stayed up until the wee hours of the morning to try and see if she's coming downstairs or to figure out what exactly is going on.\u00a0\u00a0We heard her walking around in her room, but she didn't come out of it at all.\u00a0\u00a0This is a nightly occurrence.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes she does come out of her room and tells us she had a bad dream.\u00a0\u00a0She uses that one alot.\u00a0\u00a0 We're going to take her to a clinic for\u00a0\u00a0all of this but not sure what we will get out of it since there are so many things she's not willling to fix, acknowledge, etc.We also suspect cocaine usage with her.\u00a0\u00a0Every two weeks or so she is getting what seems to be like a cold.\u00a0\u00a0It lasts for at least a week and is a common occurence.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ugh!Thank you for your help and for sharing the above\u00a0\u00a0info, it helps!",
