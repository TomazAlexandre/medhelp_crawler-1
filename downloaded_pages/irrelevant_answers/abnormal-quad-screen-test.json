            "answer": "Your story sounds very similar ;) I didn't have bleeding, but I've had a lot of setbacks along the way with my twins (including gestational diabetes). My screening also came back showing I was at risk for carrying a baby w/Down's Syndrome. Like you, we met with a genetic counselor & then we decided on having an amnio. A week later, we learned we're carrying two healthy babies :)\u00a0\u00a0I agree w/Prevatt. Try to stay calm. It's best for your baby if mommy isn't so stressed. You'll get the answers you need & I pray your little one is just fine ;)",

            "answer": "Hi I just want to you to know that alot of us have had bad numbers and had healthy babies. I was 30 with my last baby and had soft markers for downs and low quad results. I visited a gentic councelor (sp, sorry) I was offered an amnio or an abortion. I was 20 weeks with my little girl! I was very upset when the abortion was offered to me. It never crossed my mind. Well fast forward to now I have a healthy 5 month old girl named Taylor Marie:~) Those test cant tell you if somethings wrong, just the likelyhood. And even 1:100 is only 1%. Odds seem pretty good to me. I know its hard not to worry cause I did my whole pregnany but try and relax and enjoy UNLESS YOU positivly KNOW otherwise:~)",

I'm just trying to relax and have faith that everything will be okay. I'm keeping my baby no matter what and I know I will love him/her with all of my heart! I just don't want my baby to have to suffer if he/she does have any abnormalities. Well, I guess I will find out on Wednesday...it seems so far away....I will definitely keep you all posted!Thanks again. This forum is AWESOME! :)",

    "question": "Hello Everyone. This is my first time posting here. I'm 35 and 17 week pregnant today! YAY! Although it hasn't been an easy 17 weeks. It started with 3 episodes of red bleeding in my first trimester. I was diagnosed with a Threatened Miscarriage and was terrified. This happened during Xmas time, so it was extremely stressful. Well, we made it through that, all the sonograms showed a healthy baby with a strong heartbeat. They weren't ever able to tell me why I was bleeding, but it seems to have resolved itself because I haven't had anymore episodes. Thank God!Okay, then at my 15 week check up, I find out that I have Gestational Diabetes. This news completely floored me because I have 2 other children and I never had any problems/complications during those pregnancies so to find this out was devestating. I met with my Diabetic Counselor and Nutritionist and they were very helpful at putting my mind at ease in dealing with this lastest issue. All I have to do is manage my diet and exericise and I should be okay. So far, so good, I've been keeping my levels down which is very reassuring.Okay, so now to yesterday. I'm finally feeling like everything is going well. I'm in my 2nd trimester, no more bleeding, I'm able to control my GD and I've been feeling the baby kick like crazy. BAM! My Dr calls me and tells me that my Quad Screen Test came back abnormal and they want me to do further testing and see a genetic counselor. Of course this sent me into panic, I just knew this meant something was wrong with my baby. So I've been crying for the last 24 hours and I just can't seem to stop worrying that something is wrong. I scheduled my level 2 sonogram for next Wednesday, so this is going to be a long, worriesome 7 days.I just wanted to know if anyone else had an abnormal Quad Screen. I heard that there is a high rate of false positives, but I can't help but think that there is something wrong with my baby. :(",
