The food industry is very well aware that if people knew what they are eating, they wouldn\u2019t want to eat it at the first place.chicken-in-cagesThese food companies have the images of healthy and happy livestock on the cover of their products, but the reality could not be any further than the truth. These chickens are raised in filthy cages their whole lives while being mistreated. The chickens are fed corn, drugs, hormones, GMOs and other crap to grow faster and become larger and because of their heavy weight they get crippled or suffer from all kinds of diseases like bronchitis, ammonia, weakened immune system, respiratory problems or organ failures. These chickens are also fed all kinds of drugs that have arsenic and antibiotics, but what the food industry doesn\u2019t want you to know is that based on the Consumer Reports two thirds of chickens in the grocery stores are contaminated with arsenic, dangerous bacteria or salmonella.raw-milkEven lately FDA finally came out clean on this issue and admitted that chickens in the US contain arsenic. Arsenic is a toxic chemical that causes cancer or even death in high dosages. Consumers should know that arsenic is added to chickens diet by food industry on purpose. Studies show a strong correlation between cancer and the amount of arsenic in human body. The truth is that chickens we buy at the grocery store contain all kinds of hormones, antibiotics, arsenic, GMOs and carcinogens.In August 2010 FDA raided Rawsome grocery store in California where people bought raw milk and fresh products. They poured down all the raw milk and fresh fruits and vegetables down the drain. It seems like FDA is more concerned about raw milk than the increasing number of hormones, GMOs and toxic additives in our food supply. With all the health consequences of consuming arsenic and other heavy metals in our food and water, FDA still claims that low level of arsenic in chickens is safe for human consumption. Well I bet FDA knows that there is surly a limit on how much poison can be tested on human beings.I have one question for the ones who believe that the use of hormones, chemicals, and GMOs in our food have nothing to do with all the chronic diseases we see every day in a friend, close family member or a neighbor. Our DNA hasn\u2019t changed for the last few decades but our environment has.How could the rate of obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes go drastically up in just few decades if our DNA hasn\u2019t changed since then? I'm not necessary suggesting that use of chemicals and hormones is changing DNA of chickens but I'm wondering about the large wave of chronic diseases waiting for this new generation of obesity because of these increasing number of chemicals, hormones and GMOs. We consume meat full of hormones and chemicals and don't even notice that the fish in our plate is FDA approved genetically modified salmon (grown in ONLY 2 weeks) because of companies like Monsanto that spend $46 million to hide GMOs in our food supply without it being labelled. Thanks to food industry now our children at the age of 10 are diagnosed with diabetes, plaque buildup in their arteries and many other chronic diseases.-\u00a0\u00a0http://www.seattleorganicrestaurants.com/vegan-whole-foods/genetically-modified-chickens/",

            "answer": "Thanks, I thought it was pretty long... I'll try to watch it over the next couple of days.. I did see some of it a while back, but not all of it, then it was removed from the internet; now it's been put back on...My husband mentioned a few years ago that \"when I was in school (3th/4th grade), the girls didn't have breasts like they do now and we weren't grown up before our time; where's this coming from?\"... I told him I thought it, along with a lot of other things was coming from hormones, antibiotics, pesticides and herbicides in our food and he thought I was crazy...We see all kinds of conditions on the rise, from ADHD, depression, anxiety, autism, to autoimmune conditions and a lot of them are being traced back to what we eat and immunizations.A lot of you know that I worked in the water/wastewater field for the past 20+ years... The chemicals are all there in the water you drink and the food you eat, the drugs you take (or give your children)...I wish I was 30 yrs younger and knew what know now... I'd be an activist that Congress would know by name...",
