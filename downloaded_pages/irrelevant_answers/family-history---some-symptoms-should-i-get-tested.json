            "answer": "Hello PonyFly,I am one of the volunteers here and Not a Medical Professional, so always folow up with a physician, especially when in doubt.\u00a0\u00a0My advice is based on my experience in caring for my son, now 11 who was diagnosed at age 3.\u00a0\u00a0My sis also has type 1 and was dxd in early adulthood.Extreme thirst and excessive urination (and large amounts of urine) are 2 big symptoms of high blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0In other words, they can be symptoms of type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If your pancreas has slowed down or stopped insulin production, your blood sugar would rise and you would eventually become very ill.You have a step up as far as being aware of symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0(If it was not for my sister, I may not have really realized my son's symptoms as quickly as I did.)Here are a couple suggestions....if either of your cousins live nearby, it would not hurt to test your blood sugar on his/her glucometer.Fatigue is another symptom.Are you on any new medications?\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes certain medications make us thirsty.\u00a0\u00a0I go to the bathroom more than 7 times a day, but I drink tons of water.Because of the increased urination and your thirst, as well as having a low energy level, etc. AND family history, I would say, yes, go to the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0If you have a primary care physician, please make an appointment as soon as you can.\u00a0\u00a0Tell the doc about your 2 cousins and about the symptoms you are experiencing.\u00a0\u00a0IF you are at the very beginning stage of type 1, you may at times have what is considered a normal blood glucose reading, however, there are other tests that can be done to test the insuin production.ALSO, if your symptoms worsen before getting into see your doctor, go to the emergency room.\u00a0\u00a0I am not telling you this to scare you, but if you were to start vomitting or you feel worse, please go to the emergency room.\u00a0\u00a0DO NOT ignore it.You are very smart to think of getting tested.\u00a0\u00a0Please keep us posted and I wish you the best and that you do not have diabetes, but, IF you do, please know it is treatable and diabetics can live long, healthy lives.Take care:)SS",

            "answer": "I'm not on any other medications. I occasionally take allergy medications but was not on an allergy med when I started having symptoms.I'm just worried. I'm going to my school's health center tomorrow morning bright and early. I'm seven hours from home right now, so I'm not near cousins. I know it's treatable since I really can't remember my youngest cousin living without diabetes but I also remember how difficult it was at the beginning for her to get a handle on it.I will let you know what they say tomorrow.What is the normal test? Will I have immediate results? Should I eat before I go (it's walk-ins only)?",

            "answer": "Tell them your symptoms and that type 1 is in your family and they will know what to do, however, always go with your gut instinct, so, if you are not satisfied, get a 2nd opinion.Keep in mind that there have been advancements in the last 10 years since your cousin was diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0My son was given shots from the age of 3 until 9-1/2 and then went on an insulin pump.\u00a0\u00a0We have found the pump to help control his blood sugars better.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, he can eat more carbs at one time which has made eating way more flexible.When my son was tested, 8 years ago, I TOLD his pediatrician to test him.\u00a0\u00a0The doc said, \"Some kids ask for a lot to drink for attention.\"\u00a0\u00a0I told him I knew my child and my sis had type 1 and he needed to be tested.\u00a0\u00a0They sent us to a lab so he could give a urine sample and we did not get results until the afternoon, which now does not make any sense to me because they could have checked it for ketones and had results that he did infact have ketones and we would have known immediately.I am unsure exactly what test they do, but testing for ketones is simple and testing your blood sugar with a glucometer is a quick test, as well, however, they might want to take blood to find out how your pancreas is functioning as far as insulin production.\u00a0\u00a0(I do not know the name of this test)Try not to worry tonight.\u00a0\u00a0You are doing the right thing.\u00a0\u00a0You are smart for going tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0You know your body and you know when something is not right.\u00a0\u00a0This is why I say that if you need to get a second opinion, do so.Please post your news when you have any.Take care of yourself.SS",

            "answer": "I know it can be scary.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter (non diabetic) has had some funky (out of range) blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Not steadily, but from time to time, so if I notice symptoms, I test her.There is an antibody test they do for family members to see if you have the precursors.\u00a0\u00a0(I think that is the term - forgive me,...I am not great with medical terminology)\u00a0\u00a0I know one family who has a son with type 1 and they had the daughter tested for the antibodies and it came back positive and what I have heard is that if it comes back positive, you will develop it within 5 yrs.\u00a0\u00a0(do not quote me)\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, the daughter ended up with type 1, as well.We have it on both sides.....my sister and then my husband's dad and my son, so who knows.\u00a0\u00a0Always listen to your body and if you are not satisifed, go to a different doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor's are human and are not perfect and sometimes a 2nd or even 3rd opinion is necessary or sometimes we have to be a bit insistent when it comes to getting the care we need.Please post as soon as you have any info.SS",

            "answer": "I think you asked what the normal range was for blood sugar levels. This differs, depending on whether the blood is tested before or after eating meals. The normal range BEFORE meals is something like 70-126 (the numbers quoted can vary a little bit, depending on which doctor you see, but this will give you a pretty good idea of what you should see if your glucose was tested before you ate). AFTER meals, I have read that the non-diabetic glucose usually stays below about 148 (again, the number can vary slightly, depending on your source for this information), but obviously rises some. I wish you the very best.",

            "answer": "I gave a urine sample and blood sample this morning. They are also looking to see if I have a thyroid problem or mono in the blood sample (they couldn't get a vein in my right arm--OUCH). They will call me about mid-day tomorrow with the results from the blood test and urine results will come back Friday.Until then, I'm going to try to eat balanced meals. I was so tired and very out of it this morning after having nothing but water from 10pm to 9:30am. I had an apple juice and I'm eating some dry cereal (I also have IBS which limits some of my diet, particularly if I'm having juice or something that speeds things along).Thank you again for your help. I'll post results tomorrow. Off to take a nap.",

    "question": "I'm a 19yr girl in my freshman year of college. Two of four cousins on my mother's side have Type I diabetes (one was diagnosed less than three weeks ago--she's my age. The other was diagnosed at age 7 and is now 17).About 6 weeks ago, I began to notice that I was urinating more often than before. Whereas I may have gone once a day prior to holiday break, I am now going five to seven times a day. I'm always thirsty. Most nights, I wake up once or twice because I need something to drink or I need to use the bathroom. My energy level is very low and I feel weak and shaky sometimes. Most of the time, I simply feel tired and thirsty. I've not lost weight at all. Of course, this could simply be stress from end of my freshman year or my diet or something else.Should I get tested for diabetes simply based on a few symptoms and family history?I'm traveling to Ukraine in about a month and a half and my worry is that if I don't get it checked out now, there could be a problem in a country where I don't speak the language at all and my parents wouldn't be able to travel over there.",
