            "answer": "Hi,It is important to know if you have been evaluated for sinusitis. Sinusitis can cause pain behind the eyes, in the temple region which can get worse on head turning or forward bending.You can try steam inhalation and see if it helps with you pain.However it needs to be confirmed by a clinical exam and tests. Other possibilities are neck issues like cervical spondylosis, disc prolapse, cervical stenosis which also need to be looked into.Hope this helps!",

    "question": "Hey Everyone,About 4 days ago, I had woke up super quick because I was running late. I've got high blood pressure, and diabetes. Not sure that it will be related. Anyhow, I've had a cold prior. I got in the car and was driving to my destination, while in the car I had a coughing fit, and in the middle of coughing a horrible pain clicked on that I have never experienced before. It went from the top of my neck where my spine meets my head, to the left of my head, through the middle of my head above my ear, by my temples... and seemingly into the back of my eye socket. I called my doctor and said it sounded like a pinched nerve... but I was still nervous. I called out of work. Came home and slept all day with some Excedrin, and it didn't help. I woke up at 9pm, went to the local hospital. They gave me a head CT and couldn't find anything... they were checking for anything with my actual head, blood, etc. Major I guess. The radiologist didn't find anything. I went home with some pain reliever for tension headaches IC-Butal APAP Caf tabs? Doesn't seem to really touch the problem. The pain is still there. In my neck, a headache... Not a super bad one... but just there, and in my eyes. If I move too much I can feel it more, specially turning my neck, etc. If I cough I can feel the whole area everywhere throb while I cough, and mostly in my eye and head. I'd like to know if this is a normal thing? Does it sound like a pinched nerve? Any help?I want this to go away. It's horrible.",
