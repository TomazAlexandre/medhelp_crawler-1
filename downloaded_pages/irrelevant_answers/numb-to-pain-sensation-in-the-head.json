    "question": "Good day, I wonder if you can assist me.\u00a0\u00a0I have recently started non surgical face lifts and when the machine moves above my eyes and over the forehead I don't feel the electrical impulses at all, I can feel that the probe is there but nothing else.\u00a0\u00a0We did a test and this sensation runs all the way down the back into my neck before I start to feel the impulses again.I do suffer from high blood pressure which has of late been incredible high that has resulted in being placed on a beta blocker.\u00a0\u00a0I have all the classic blood pressure symptoms of headaches, blood shot eyes at times, floating bits in my eyes etc.However, I am beginning to think that this might have been the case, no 'pain' sensation for many many years as even when I was a child the harder my hair was brushed the nicer it was.Is there anything that I should be concerned about regarding this?Kind regardsNatasha",
