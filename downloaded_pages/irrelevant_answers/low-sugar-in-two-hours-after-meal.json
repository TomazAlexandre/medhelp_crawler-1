            "answer": "This could possibly be a condition known as Hypoglycemia and is definitely worth asking your doctor about.\u00a0\u00a0Hypoglycemia occurs around two hours after a high carb meal.\u00a0\u00a0The pancreas over secretes insulin due to the rapid rise in the blood sugar and then the low blood sugar results.\u00a0\u00a0I would definitely have this studied further. Have a wonderful day.\u00a0\u00a0CD",

            "answer": "Ale,I'm not a phsyician, but am a long-time diabetic.It's interesting to me that you're testing your blood even tho' you seem to not have a medical diagnosis yet for diabetes or hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0Is there diabetes in your family? or close pals who have it?The good news is that you're alert to these numbers -- and so whaever you might have, you can begin treatment (if needed) before things progress.Until you see your doctor, I recommend that you keep good records and try to adjust your lifestyle to give you the most \"normal\" numbers you can.\u00a0\u00a0If that means cutting back on refined carbos and sweets, please consider doing that.\u00a0\u00a0YOu'll be helping your doc so very much by bringing your detailed records to him/her.\u00a0\u00a0That way s/he can figure out how best to work with you.Good luck, I wish you well.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you'll let us know how things turn out.",

    "question": "Hello, sometimes after meal my blood sugar can be up to 190 mg/dl (if I ate a lot of carb-rich meals such as bread).The test with oral intake of 75 g of glucose gave a rise up to 210 mg/dl (after 50 min),and then a fast drop to 61 mg/dl (after 135 min).Is it considered normal and what should I do with this?Is such condition known and can it develop to diabetes?My fasting sugar is always around 90 mg/dl.Thank you!",
