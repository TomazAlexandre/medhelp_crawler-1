            "answer": "Drinking a lot and using the restroom alot is a sign of Diabetes...(I have it). I am sure if his parents told his doctor about him always being thirsty and they want a A1C done I wouldn't think the Doctor would have a problem with it. I suggest only giving him water and non-sugar drinks because the more sugary drinks (if it is Diabetes) the worse it is for him. Good Luck!",
