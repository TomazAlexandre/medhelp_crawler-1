            "answer": "OMG, he's NOT treating you????I highly advise that you find a new endocrinologist, one who specializes in thyroid, NOT DIABETES!Bella, is your Free T4 12 or 1.2? Please post your lab ranges for FT3 and FT4.Anyway, elevated TPO with a TSH above 2.0 indicates Hashimoto's Lymphatic Thyroiditis. Did the doctor tell you this? Did the doctor explain ANYTHING about Hashimoto's to you???Your TPO (809) antibodies are VERY elevated. Anything over 35 indicates Hashi. I have Hashi. Mine is a 221.You should be put on thyroid hormone replacement\u00a0\u00a0- pronto!Please read the below article...http://thyroid.about.com/od/hypothyroidismhashimotos/a/preventative.htmIf you live in the states and want to find a recommended endo, visit this site:http://www.thyroid-info.com/topdrs/Take care...:) Tamra",

            "answer": "Thanks Tamra.I looked it up and FT4 is sometimes divided by 100 in a lab result so mine would be 1.2. On my results it just has my FT3 as 5.0.He didnt really explain anything, just said come back in a year for a test, unless I get pregnant, then I should come in straight away. My dad is hypo and on replacement therapy, I might try and see his dr instead? I did think the TPO was kinda high, my lab said under 6 is normal range.Ill get a second opinion I think, I just wasnt too sure about it all. Thanks!",

    "question": "I was recently tested for thyroid disorder as Ive got a very enlarged thyroid and enlarged lymph nodes all over my neck. My results came back as: Free T4: 12, TSH: 2.5, Free T3: 5, TPO antibodies: 809. My doctor said he didnt think this required any treatment but to come back in a year for more tests. Thyroid is still very large and have some thyroid-ish symptoms - just wondering if his advice is right...?",
