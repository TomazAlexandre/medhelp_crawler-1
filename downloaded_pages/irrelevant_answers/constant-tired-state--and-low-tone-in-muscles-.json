            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, it is possible to faint or lose consciousness or muscle tone while laughing or any other activity. What you suffer from is probably a vasovagal syncope or a vasovagal attack. The complex group of symptoms is mediated by the vagus nerve. This nerve is irritated by prolonged standing, standing up suddenly, stress, pain, hunger, dehydration, intense emotion etc. A tilt table test, holter monitor, echocardiogram etc are done for confirmed diagnosis. Discuss this with your doctor.The other possibility is gelastic seizures. These are seizure triggered by laughing and other such activities and include fainting, shaking, stony appearance, head falling back, loss of muscle tone, proper seizures etc. You need to consult a neurologist regarding this.Extreme fatigue could be due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems. Another possibility is sleep disturbances (like sleep apnea, imbalance of rapid eye and non rapid eye movement sleep etc.). You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, low Vit b12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium. Hyperthyroidism too causes increased sweating and tiredness.\u00a0\u00a0 A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi, I am a 20 yr old female, ever since the age of about 12, I have always felt tired. I am never able to sleep the whole night through and can normally sleep for periods of about 4 hours, then i have to get up, do something, and go back to bed, for about 4 hours, so i have a very disturbed sleep. This is during the day as well, I have to have about 3 hours sleep in the afternoon, and maybe again in the evening.At about the age of 16, I began to notice, that when i laughed, or done extreme physical activity, my muscles seemed to disappear, and I become like a rag doll! literally if im holding something, its just drops to the floor, and my head and shoulders drop, i literally become floppy.Even after sleep. I still feel i need more and after being awake for a few hours, my body just feels drrained.I have been to the docs about this so many times. they thought it was diabetes, but is isnt. can someone please help me !",
