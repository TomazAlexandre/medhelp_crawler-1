            "answer": "Hello,It is true that loss of libido is very commonly found in women after menopause due to the diminishing levels of hormones. Talk to your husband for the psychological support. If you are having any stress, then this psychological support will help. A healthy affectionate communication with the partner helps in decreasing anxiety and stress. Also get hormone replacement therapy in the form of pills or patches prescribed.Moreover causes need to be ruled out. These include anemia, diabetes and hormonal imbalance. Some investigations which need to be done are follicle stimulating hormone levels, estradiol, thyroxine and thyrotrophin levels in the blood test reports.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

That is really all I can tell\u00a0\u00a0you. Just be sure to really investigate the FACTS on any drug you decide to try and talk to you doctor before taking it. There are adverse effects to all drugs.",
