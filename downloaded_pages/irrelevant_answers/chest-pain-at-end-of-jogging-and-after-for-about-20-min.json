    "question": "I am having some chest pains at the end of my jog and they continue for about 20-25 min. after I stop jogging.Background info:My Grandfather had 2-4 large heart attacks and had to have triple bypass surgery.My father had to have one of his arteries ballooned when he was around 38.My Uncle has diabetes (not sure what type)I am 21, 5'11'', 295lbs, non-smoker, non-drinker, not sure of cholesterol or blood pressure.This pain is on the right side of my chest between my nipples, and is equal distance from the center of my chest and my right nipple. It is sharp . After about 25 minutes it will go away.Any ideas on what this is and if I should go and see a cardiologist? If I do see one, any recommended tests I should take?Thanks so much!",
