    "question": "My possible exposure occured Two years ago. Unprotected Oral with a girl i have known all my life. Recentley ive heard she had hiv for Three years and i have been the only one she has been with in the past 3 Years.The past year the symptoms have been occurring that i never really took notice of. I seem to get sick, flu-like symptoms 3 months out of the 12 every year on and off, i have been blood tested for thyroid problems and diabetes because i had rapid weight gain i was 200lbs and gained 50 pounds in 4 months. after the thyroid test came back they said there was a problem and needed to lose weight to regulate my thyroid i lost 25lbs got blood tested again (not for hiv) and the thyroid issue was taken care of. i have a rash which since i was little is beleived to be eczema. and have had chyamlidia before and got that taken care of. ( just curious... can thyroid problems shown in blood tests be mistaken of hiv??? because they have seen something wrong with the blood causing the thyroid to have a problem that was causing weight gain and once i lost weight the test was normal... white blood cell count and everything was fine, so can it be mistaken for hiv??? thanks to anyone who helps me out, im stressing.",
