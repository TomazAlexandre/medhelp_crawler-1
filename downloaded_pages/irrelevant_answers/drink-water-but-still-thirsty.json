            "answer": "HiThe tests you have posted are normal. So you may not have diabetes mellitus. But you will still have to rule out diabetes insipidus.\u201cBecause DM is more common and because DM and DI have similar symptoms, a health care provider may suspect that a patient with DI has DM. But testing should make the diagnosis clear.A doctor must determine which type of DI is involved before proper treatment can begin. Diagnosis is based on a series of tests, including urinalysis and a fluid deprivation test.Urinalysis is the physical and chemical examination of urine. The urine of a person with DI will be less concentrated. Therefore, the salt and waste concentrations are low and the amount of water excreted is high. A physician evaluates the concentration of urine by measuring how many particles are in a kilogram of water or by comparing the weight of the urine with an equal volume of distilled water.A fluid deprivation test helps determine whether DI is caused by one of the following:\u2022\texcessive intake of fluid\u2022\ta defect in ADH production\u2022\ta defect in the kidneys\u2019 response to ADHThis test measures changes in body weight, urine output, and urine composition when fluids are withheld. Sometimes measuring blood levels of ADH during this test is also necessary.In some patients, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain may be necessary as well.\u201d Refer: http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/insipidus/index.htm#diagnosisHope this helps.
