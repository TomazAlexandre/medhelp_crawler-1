    "question": "Ok, I am 32 weeks and was at Labor and delivery on Friday due to spotting and contracting regularly- the contractions eventually stopped but I've begun to funnel. The attending Ob//Gyn did an ultrasound and found the baby is transverse high in my rib cage.What are the percentages the baby will actually turn to head - down.
