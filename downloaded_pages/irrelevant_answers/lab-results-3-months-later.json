            "answer": "Mike, thank you for posting. Do you know much about how much lower my platelet count might drop before it is consider unsafe and what can they do for it. I take a beta blocker currently. The Platelets being so low are due to my spleen being enlarged from the portal\u00a0\u00a0hypertension. I assume the level will continue to drop as long as the spleen continues to get larger.Zeak your bilirubin is great right where it\u2019s at. You don\u2019t need to worry yourself about this at all. I always fast before every lab test although per a recent conversation I had it is not necessary with the exception of Glucose. Mine currently is at the top of its range and this level is very important to cirrhotic patients. Especially with a family history of diabetes. Good luck to you. The only advice I know of to bring down your bilirubin is don't consume alcohol.Randy",

            "answer": "I don't think you're at any significant risk of bleeding if that is what your concerned about. Mine were a lot lower than yours - maybe in the 30,0000 range - and I was treated with Hep C treatment so my doctors were not very concerned. I think a clotting time test - PT/PTT or INR might be more valuable in terms of assessing any possible bleeding risks.The beta blocker is to control your portal pressure and doesn't directly affect platelet count.Mike",
