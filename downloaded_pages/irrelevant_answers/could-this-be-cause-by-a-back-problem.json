            "answer": "I suffer with back problems and with that comes all different sensations. I have had anxiety issues myself in the past and still do here and there so I know that different feelings can bring on these anxiety issues. I get really bad back aches if i stand too long and the exercising part for me is about non exisent anymore. Anytime I try to start an exercise program I am in lots of pain. About your private area that is common for people with back problems and nerve issues. I get a vibrating feeling in my private area, it feels like a cell phone going off. It does not hurt but it is the most annoying thing ever. YOu may read about people getting pains down there or numbness. My suggestion would be to go see your doctor and then see a specialist who can order different tests to see where the problem is. An X-ray usually does not show any problems with your discs where an MRI will.I just wanted tp put your mind at rest a little bit about what you are feeling. Do not get anxious over this. Go get it checked out. If it is a back problem you may get all different kinds of feelings from this. Have you injured yourself lately that you know of or did you strain your back in any way?Good luck in finding what is causing the problem.Chadry",

    "question": "I don't know if I'm in the right spot.I haven't been to a doctor because I'm not too sure what I'm experiencing.I am a 21 year old female. Have had diabetes since I was about 6.I have anxiety too so I'm not sure if some of these are symptoms from that or not.I've experienced back pain on and off, mostly my lower back but sometimes upper/middle. Usually when I stand for a while and exercise, etc.I have also been experiencing muscle twitches. They do not hurt. They are all over. They come and go.Every once in awhile I get pains in my personal area, also feel a little tingling type sensation, does not hurt though.It is very bothersome. And because I don't know what this is from, I am very anxious and worried.Again I dunno what is causing this and wondering if this could be from back problems?Sorry if this is not the right place to ask this.",
