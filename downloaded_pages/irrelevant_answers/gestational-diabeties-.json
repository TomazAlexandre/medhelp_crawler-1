            "answer": "Im not 100% sure on everything but i do know you need to watch what ur eating and my friend got this digital reader so she could take a prick of blood so many times a day to make sure shes not higher or lower. Often women that have like big babies (over 10lbs) most likely had gestional diabetes but never knew about it. And once u pop ur baby out you can kiss goodbye to the placenta and the diabetes lol its really just meating with ur dr and making sure you know how to deal with it. What you can and cant eat and all that fun stuff. Ur baby will be fine and will not be born with diabetes either.",

            "answer": "They were watching my sugar levels for a while and basically I saw 2 doctors, my regular one and the one that deals with diabeties. I took a afternoon class at the hospital where they showed me how to check my sugar level and gave me the machine to take home with me. The class didn't take long but was followed by a dietician who gives u a food guide for diabeties and goes through portions and what u can and can not eat. I had my sugar levels recorded in a book and every appointment they looked at them, took my weight, urine sample and blood pressure. It turned out that I don't have gestational diabeties but im still pricking my fanger just to make sure my sugars don't all of a sudden spike. Im currently 35 wks 3 days pregnant and lost a total of 18 lbs and baby is healthy. Hope this helped good luck",
