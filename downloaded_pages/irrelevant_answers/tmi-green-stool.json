            "answer": "I just did a little research for you as I went thru this not too long ago. Antacids can change color but its typically gray colored. But since they are green, than maybe?! Green typically comes from added iron, passing thru quickly to where it doesn't have time to change brown, leafy greens and green or purple artificial coloring. If you have vomiting, diarrhea or cramping- call doc right away. Hope that helps.",
