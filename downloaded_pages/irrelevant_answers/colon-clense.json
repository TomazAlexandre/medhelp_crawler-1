I hav IBS. I read the colon cleanse would remove toxins from the body, allowing the digestive system to work better on removing toxins from the body. I am constantly either constipated or running to the bathroom. Any suggestions greatly appreciated. Thank you for your reply.",

            "answer": "I'm not sure of the effect of my meds.I take Actos+met, Triamterene for water retention, Tramodol HCL for pain. Tizanidine for muscle spasms, AmbienCR for sleep, Lyrica, and Celexa. I know Lyrica is supposed to cause loose bowels, but it doesn't with me. Possibly the pain meds are constipating. I go 2-3 days without a movement, then a couple days of diarehha. My dr told me to take a fiber pill, but I forget to do that. I know, bad girl. I just wondered if the products really cleaned out the clogged pipes they talk about. Jaybay says the are just expensive nonesense, which was my inclination, just wondered if anyone here had tried them. I think I'll skip trying them.",

            "answer": "You have your bowel cleanse with diarrhea. Quite some patients who have diagnosis of IBS (and also with diabetes) were found to have small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) - more bacteria in the small bowel as appropriate - this can cause diarrhea. Diagnosis is with breath test - you drink a glass of lactulose, than gases you expire are measured. Your gastroenterologist would do that, treatment is by antibiotics.Fibromyalgia and IBS both occur in sensitive people in emotional stress. Is there anything you can do about it? If you check description of Triamterene, tramadol, tizanidine, AmbienCR, Lyrica and Celexa, you'll see that all of them can cause constipation.I would talk with your doctor, if you really need all those drugs - especially for sleep and spasms. Please, do not drop any of these, before you ask a doctor.",
