            "answer": "I personally think that even though you don't have any of the risk factors, you also have nothing to lose by taking precaution. It's a simple test that'll help reassure you and your doctor that everything that can be done for your child is done. If you have any questions regarding the procedure itself or the benefits of the test, you can contact your OB's office and ask someone to explain it to you, don't let them get away with pushing your concerns aside. Again, even if you're certain there's no history of diabetes in your family or feel you're not at risk, you have nothing to lose by taking the test. We also had NO history of diabetes in my family and yet I now have an 11 year old diabetic nephew. Just a thought. Good luck.",

            "answer": "You NEED to take it. Risk factors or not. Every pregnancy is different. Just because a previous pregnancy didnt have it doesnt mean u won't. I get GD every time I'm pregnant for other reasons, but I know what it does to the baby when u have it.My DD 3 weeks early was 7lb 3 oz. If you develop it and its not managed your baby will come out and u wont be able to hold it immediately cause it will be on meds cause its sugar will bottom out. It wont necessarily appear in your urine if u have it either. That is a bodies last resort to expel sugar, through urine. So you can have GD and it never appear in ur urine.",

            "answer": "It is a mandatory test to make sure you don't have gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes is diabetes DURING pregnancy. Some women can also develop diabetes after pregnancy if they have GD.It is important to test for this because it can also lead to other problems and complications if you have it and do not deal with it.It's a very simple test. You drink a sugary glucose drink. After an hour they will draw your blood.",

            "answer": "I'm a complete hippie so I'm with you on unnecessary testing. My only issue is they have a very low threshold for what passes for the 1 hour test. If you fail it you'll have to do it again and wait 3 hours and what fails on that is a lot higher. Most of us don't down food with that much sugar the. Just sit still for an hour. We eat a.normal meal and we move we do things and if you have kids you move a lot. I think the reason behind the test if great but the execution of it is really messed up. I had a friend who's doctor only did the 1 hour test and she failed and they refused to retest her they put on insulin and she ended up in the er because she really didn't have it. Like I said there are issues with test but it can save lives. All I can say is do your research and ask your doctor",

    "question": "My doctor scheduled a glucose screening test for next week, and I'm not sure if I want to have it done or not. I honestly don't know that much about it, so I'd love your advice and opinions.First of all, not that I don't like doctors, but I hate the fact that they do all these unnecessary tests. I'm 21, and my first child weighed 7lbs. I don't have anyone in my family with diabetes, and I'm not overweight. I don't have any of the risk factors. My doctors test my urine every time I have an appointment, and my blood pressure, and everything has always been normal. When the doc mentioned the test, I made it very clear that I was unhappy about it, but I didn't refuse. He did nothing to explain why he thought it was necessary, or how important it is. He didn't even give me a choice. (Although I know I could have refused.) That frustrated me, because I think it's important for them to discuss things so that you understand, and give you the chance to make an educated decision. With all these 8 minutes appointments, they seem in such a rush to get out of there, and don't take the time to explain. Anyways, I don't know if I'm just so frustrated that I'm being unreasonable, but I'd like to ask your opinion on the matter.",
