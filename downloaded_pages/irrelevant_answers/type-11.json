            "answer": "My son has had diabetes since he was 7 years old; my brother when he was a baby. Things have gotten soooo much better since my brother was diagnosed, but I don't think there is anything but insulin that is available. If you are like me, I was just happy to be able to bring my son home from the hospital, when there are so many parents that never get that chance. Just find a great doctor that it up on all the new diabetic supplies. There is an insulin pen that does do a better job than a syringe & then when your baby gets to school age, get an insulin pump. Also, the meter called the Freestyle Lite is great! It is the only meter right now that will not only light up the screen, but it will also light up your baby's finger when you ***** it so that you do not have to turn on a light in the room at night that might wake the baby up. Good luck!",
