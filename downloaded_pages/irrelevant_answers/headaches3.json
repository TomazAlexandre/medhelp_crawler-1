This will be hard to do.\u00a0\u00a0Be a nag. There may be a financial problem with insurance. If so try to locate a clinic in your area, or look on the internet for\u00a0\u00a0\"Hill-Burton\" hospitals and try to set up an appointment for her.

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Unexplained aches and pains coming on and off could be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, anemia, liver disorders, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Vit B12 or Vit D deficiency and due to calcium or magnesium deficiency. It can also be due to sleep related disorders. In women it can be due to hormonal disturbances related to PCOD/menopause.It is also possible that headaches and bodyaches are not related. Sinusitis, refractive errors of the eye, migraine, cluster headaches, brain tumors, high blood pressure, tension headaches, temporal arteritis, pinched cervical spinal nerve, poor or disturbed sleep etc are several causes of headaches. Dental pain and ear ache can cause similar symptoms.It is difficult to diagnose the cause of headaches and body-aches on net. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
