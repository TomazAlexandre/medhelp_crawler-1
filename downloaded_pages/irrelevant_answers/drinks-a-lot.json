            "answer": "While excessive thirst IS one of the symptoms of diabetes, that alone is not cause for alarm.\u00a0\u00a0Other signs to watch for are frequent urination, dramatic weight loss, and sometimes the symptoms can mimic the stomach flu.\u00a0\u00a0If your daughter is especially active, the 5-8 bottles of liquid you mention may be what her body requires to stay hydrated in the summer's heat.\u00a0\u00a0Just to put things in perspective for you, just prior to my son's diagnosis he was drinking gallons of water a day and begging for more!\u00a0\u00a0If your daughter's demand for fluids continues or escalates or she exhibits any of the additional symptoms, I suggest you consult her pediatrician and ask for his/her guidance.",

            "answer": "I was glad to hear that you are making an appointment with her physician. It maybe nothing, but if it is type 1 diabetes, the sooner you know the better.\u00a0\u00a0Thirst alone maybe typical if she is very active. The test is very simple as JDRF Team JHG advised. Please let us know how things come out.\u00a0\u00a0We are all in this together and will help in anyway we can.Best wish's,Debbie",

            "answer": "Generally the doctor starts with a simple urine test that will tell him whether or not ketones are present in the urine.\u00a0\u00a0He may also choose to do a finger ***** to obtain a blood sample to check blood sugar levels. This is similar to the test I'm sure you had done when you were pregnant to check you iron level.",

    "question": "My 3-year old daughter seems to drink a lot during the day. It could be water, juice, milk, or other drinks. I am concerned about this.Is this normal for kids to drink 5-8 bottles of liquid during the day or could this be a symptom of diabetes?
