            "answer": "I honestly dont think its that he is in a growth spurt because any growth spurts that he has had in the past last a month or so this has been going on every day for a little over a year now. And the only thing that the dr has said thus far is its not diabetes, I had to listen to him scream and cry for 3 hours last night because when I made dinner I made enough for me, my husband and Jakob ( my younger son doesnt eat steak) we each got 1 good size steak, green beans, and mac and cheese. Jakob cried because I only made enough , no more no less, so there were no seconds.My husband tells me that it sounds like he has colic at 7 years old. I didnt think that was possible but maybe it is.",

            "answer": "So far the Dr is trying to treat it as reflux, he is on indigestion pills right now and still he acts that way. Dr said no way is it diabetes because he is gaining weight like crazy.\u00a0\u00a0Dr said that for 2 weeks he wants him taking the indigestion pills and if that doesnt work he will send him to get more extensive blood work done because there is something else wrong.I thought when it all started that it was behavioral too but being that he is in counceling and he has been on mood stabilizers and those arent helping either the councelor said that she doesnt think its behavioral.\u00a0\u00a0Who knows but I will keep you posted on what the Dr says and finds out since I know you are probably just as frustrated over this as I have been.",

    "question": "My 7 year old in the the last year or so will tell me that he is hungry and when I dont feed him at that specific moment then he goes in his room and screams and cries and \"flails\" around in his room. We has his random blood sugar tested and the dr said that his blood sugar is fine but I still think that something is wrong, a child should not be hungry ALL the time everyday.His teacher said that he never complains of hunger at school but as soon as he comes home he feels like he needs a meal for a snack and a couple hours later another meal for dinner (and he eats 2x more than me at every meal). He is in counceling for other issues and the councelor said she cant figure out the hunger issue either.Advise on what to do - anyone?!?!?!?",
