            "answer": "Hello Meghan23,We are volunteers here and not medical professionals.\u00a0\u00a0We have a lot of experience with Type 1 diabetes.Has your son been diagnosed with diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0I ask because it's not clear if he is diabetic or if you ended up in the wrong forum.In general, I'd suggest you work with your doctor and follow his advice.\u00a0\u00a0Ask him what this 'condition' is called so you can read up on it and ease your worries.\u00a0\u00a0If your son is diabetic, I'd recommend that you check his blood sugar when his lips turn blue and his hands & feet feel cold.Finally, evaluate his clothing relative to the weather.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps providing him more layers on his trunk (where most of the heat is generated) and ensuring he wears a warm hat (most heat is lost from our heads), scarf, gloves & socks may also allow his little body to keep all his parts warm.",
