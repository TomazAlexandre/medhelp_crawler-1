            "answer": "Hi,The white spots in skin can be caused by a yeast called tinea versicolor, vitiligo, other systemic illness. The tinea versicolor yeasts are always around us, and usually cause no problems. Some of us are more susceptible to the things that can convert tinea versicolor yeast into forms that cause the rash: heat, oily skin, birth control pills, humidity, pregnancy and corticosteroids.Tinea versicolor yeasts are not contagious.Leucoderma, also known as vitiligo, is a rare skin disease characterized by white spots and patches. The white patch or spot is called as leucoderma and when it occurs without any preceding disease it is called Vitiligo.Some of the perceived causes are emotional stress, hereditary factors, worms, sunburns and physical illness. This skin condition can be aggravated due to diseases like hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia and Addison's disease.It is best to get it examined and reach an accurate diagnosis so that the appropriate treatment can be initiated.It would be advisable to consult a skin specialist for a proper clinical examination.Let us know if you need any other information and post us on how he is doing.Regards",

    "question": "i got more tan than usual this summer and began to notice little white spots on my chest, shoulders, and arms. a doctor told me it was tinea versicolor and gave me a cream (which i didnt use).by the time it was november, the spots on my chest faded as i lost my tan but were still on my arms and shoulders.i went to my dermatologist a month ago and said the spots on my arms and shoulders were scars from picking zits or bug bites.so how do i know if the spots on my chest were tinea versicolor (which im now taking meds for) or simply scars that i can't do anything about?",
