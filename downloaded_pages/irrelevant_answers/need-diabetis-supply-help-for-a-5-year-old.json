            "answer": "First, I suggest that you contact his doctor. Sometimes doctors get free samples of things like test strips and he may be able to get some strips for you. I also suggest that you go online and find the maker of his glucometer and test strips and contact them directly. Often, the manufacturers can send samples. But you need to contact the doctor first, for he will be a very sick boy if you wait for some samples to get mailed to you.Another thing that you can do after you take care of the immediate need is to contact the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. On their website, www.jdrf.org, you will see a link on the left of the page that says 'Online Diabetes Support Team (ODST)'. Click on this link and then fill out and submit the form that pops up on your screen. When you submit this request, a volunteer will match your request for help with a staff member who handles all requests from people who don't have insurance... he can send you some very helpful possible resource information.I commend you for being willing to help your nephew. I hope you can get some help in order to properly take care of him.",
