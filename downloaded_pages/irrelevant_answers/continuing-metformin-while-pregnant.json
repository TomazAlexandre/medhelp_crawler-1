            "answer": "I have Type II Diabetes and just had IVF three weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0The tests say that I am pregnant so I am going to see a Diabetes Endocrinologist tomorrow just to make sure I can still take my meds (metformin and glyburide).\u00a0\u00a0If she thinks I should switch to insulin, I will.\u00a0\u00a0The needles are certainly smaller than the Progesterone shots.\u00a0\u00a0With your PCOS, you may want to see the opinion of a specialist in Diabetes care as sort of a tie breaker between the RE and the OBGYN.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck either way and with any luck we'll both be new mommies in January.",
