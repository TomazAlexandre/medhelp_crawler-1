            "answer": "I am so sorry you are having such a hard time. I had amnio\u00a0\u00a0done at 35 wks. For me I was really scared as well. But it actually wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. It was very fast and just felt like a normal shot. When my results came back the babys lungs were not mature enough. So they waited a week and delivered him at 36 wks. 3 days and he was perfectly heathly. Good luck to you. Your almost there!!",

            "answer": "Hey! I had an amnio at 24 weeks with my last son and as scary and stressful as the thought of it can be it really isn't that bad. I absolutely hate shots and having my blood drawn but the amnio didn't hurt a single bit. Just think of it this way, your doctor is trying to give your baby the best start by making sure it's lungs are mature and all it is is just that =) I hope that everything goes well for you =)",
