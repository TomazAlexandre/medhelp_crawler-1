    "question": "Hello all!! I'm new to the group and would like to know how to find the list of Chiari specialist that you have. I have been having a rough time since I was taken out of work last July (2011) and my world has been turned upside down ever since. Started out being treated for myofacial pain syndrome,then diagnosed by family dr with fibromyalgia, then found out I had type 2 diabetes, next was periphial neuropathy, confirmed fibro by rheumatologist, then chiari malformation type 1!!! Now I'm scheduled for surgery on Dec 6th due to condition worsening and I'm scared, nervous and very anxious!!! Would like to see if the dr I'm seeing is on the list. He is the 2nd neurosurgeon I've seen and highly recommended by the dr I started seeing in Jan. and I trust my dr.\u00a0\u00a0He has been very upfront about what is going on with me and has pushed to help find the answers of what is going on with me. He has not treated me like I was crazy or pushed me to the side like I was not important, but if the dr is on the list I would like to know how other people felt about him.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this makes sense!!!\u00a0\u00a0Hope you all have a great day!!",
