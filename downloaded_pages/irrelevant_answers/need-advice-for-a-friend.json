            "answer": "A lot of people who are in poor health are afraid to see\u00a0\u00a0a doctor. It seems they don't want to hear what's wrong with them or hear what they already know. You may have to be the appointment setter, the designated driver, the hand holder, and the comfort blanket for her. Convince her to see a doctor for the diabetic symptoms she is exhibiting can lead to cardiovascular issues.",

    "question": "I think my friend may have Type II Diabetes but I can't get her to see a doctor. She is overweight, always thirsty, has had a small cut that refuses to heal for about a year now, visits the restroom frequently, and has a very low energy level. Does this sound like it might be Type II to anyone else? Any ideas on how to get her to go to the doctor?",
