            "answer": "Sounds like you need to have more protein to help you and some healthy carbs like oatmeal to keep you up. Cause it sounds like you also may want to take your meds after your workout because they are doing the job of lowering your b/s and when you workout you are also burning off the sugar so you're lowering your b/s levels naturally. My disclaimer: I'm not a Dr, but this is just my opinion. Good luck on your journey to a healthier you",

            "answer": "Diabetes 86 advice is correct.\u00a0\u00a0When you are symptomatic you must test your blood sugar to know what is happening.\u00a0\u00a0it could be blood sugar or it could be something else.IF it is low blood sugar (*< 70 is considered low), then you take a small amount of sugar to bring you up.I would also consider that a protein / fat snack would be beneficial to stabilize blood sugar before working out.",

            "answer": "Hi Lindz519,First of all, congrats for getting back into exercising.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you are able to make it a habit.I recommend easing yourself back into exercising for at least a couple weeks, then increasing the intensity to the point where you feel like you can.\u00a0\u00a0The fact that you had to lay down was enough evidence that you hit it a little too hard.As for your pre-game meal, I would keep it light and hedge toward higher protein sources.\u00a0\u00a0Often, I'll eat a handful of blueberries and a few tablespoons of Greek yogurt before I head out for the gym in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0Other times, I'll have a hard-boiled egg or two.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe a handful of cashews and a few berries.\u00a0\u00a0After the workout, I'll have more protein, like a chicken breast and some steamed spinach or a green-smoothie with collard greens, kale, yogurt, chia seeds, protein powder and some other things.Good luck.",

    "question": "I did about 15 minutes of cardio then quite a bit of strength training the other day, my first day getting into exercise in a long time. I felt ok but then at the end I got dizzy, nauseous, lightheaded. I had to lay in the floor and everytime I stood up it happened again. The last time I blacked out for a couple seconds and the trainer had to catch me to keep me from falling. I had taken trulicity and my metformin that morning and had eaten breakfast, though it wasn't a healthy breakfast. I now am determined to get back on track with my sugar so I can get back in shape. In the meantime, ant rips to keep myself from passing out again??",
