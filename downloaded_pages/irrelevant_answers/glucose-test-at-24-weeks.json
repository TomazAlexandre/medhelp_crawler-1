            "answer": "When I had that test done my doctor told me not to eat anything after midnight the day before the test was going to be done. It's usually a 3 hour test. They draw blood the first time while your fasting then they give you the drink to finish within 5 minutes. An hour later from the time you finish the drink is when they draw your blood then they do that 2 more times. Which makes it a total of 4 times you get blood drawn. The first time is fasting & the other three times is after the drink. That was probably confusing but I hope that makes sense lol",
