            "answer": "It's hard to say.\u00a0\u00a0You may need to have some tests run.\u00a0\u00a0A friend of mine mentioned that every test under the sun was done.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing unusual was found, too.\u00a0\u00a0So, the conclusion the doctors came up with was something called essential tremors.\u00a0\u00a0Mainly this means that there doesn't seem to be a reason for this tremor to be happening to her.\u00a0\u00a0At least nothing of major concern.\u00a0\u00a0So, it seems to be something that has to be through the elimination process.\u00a0\u00a0My friend brought this up, because she saw some tremors in me, too.\u00a0\u00a0But, I think mine has some simple reasons for it, since it doesn't seem to happen all the time.\u00a0\u00a0Low blood sugar can cause it, fatigue and weakness can cause it, migraines can cause it, and even bad nerves can cause it.\u00a0\u00a0Even certain nutritional deficiencies can cause it.I'm not sure which tests need to be done, but seeing a neurologist seems like a good place to start.\u00a0\u00a0But, you would have to have a referral from your primary doctor.\u00a0\u00a0At least that's how insurance companies in America work for seeing a specialist.\u00a0\u00a0Someone else may have other input to add, I hope.\u00a0\u00a0But, at least this is a good place to start.",

            "answer": "I would suggest asking your doctor for a c-diff nutritional panel.\u00a0\u00a0You would find out if you have any SPECIFIC nutritional deficiencies.\u00a0\u00a0While you're at it, ask for the A1C blood test, because diabetes can cause this, too.\u00a0\u00a0Tell the doctor about the tremors and ask if there is something else the doctor suggests and ask for a referral to a neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0You may even find out that all you have are essential tremors, which means that nothing major is causing the tremors and they don't know what else would be the cause.\u00a0\u00a0As for myself, I have a condition that causes major fatigue, so sometimes I get tremors just from the fatigue itself.\u00a0\u00a0Even migraines can cause the fatigue and the tremors.\u00a0\u00a0Even in what is called the postdrome stage.",
