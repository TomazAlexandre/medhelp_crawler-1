            "answer": "Hi,from your description I think your two diagnosed existing conditions can very adequately explain what you are feeling.Keep your blood sugar under very good control (ideal target would always be less than 140, the level above which damage has been shown to occur) and see a physiotherapist of physiatrist on how to minimise the effect of the back problem.Best wishes",

            "answer": "That nerve in your lower right back is the sciatic nerve. Pain from sciatica radiates from the low back down the leg and can travel as far as the feet and to the toes. With your history of spinal issues, I sense your problem is more related to sciatica than diabetes. Get an MRI of your low back to see if you have a disc and/or vertebrae pressing/leaning against a nerve.",

    "question": "I have Type 2 diabetes along with degenerative disc disease, spondylolisthesis, and spinal stenosis. I have a tingling or a feeling like my foot was falling asleep when I stand or walk for any length of time. It seems to come on when one of the nerves in my right lower back starts to hurt and then burn. However, this tingling has been consistently there for the last week when I'm not walking or standing. I had an EMG and a nerve conduction assessment and the doctors are not certain if it's related to the back or the diabetes. I am worried that it could be something unrelated and due to a more serious condition that has not been diagnosed. Any comments would be appreciated.Thanks",
