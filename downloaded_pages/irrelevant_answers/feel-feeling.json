            "answer": "Hi!Increased sensitivity to touch or allodynia, is commonly seen in fibromyalgia. It is also seen in neuropathies (autoimmune or secondary to diabetes or hypothyroidism), in patients suffering from postherpetic neuralgia or complex regional pain syndrome. Allodynia can also be a symptom of anxiety and stress. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
