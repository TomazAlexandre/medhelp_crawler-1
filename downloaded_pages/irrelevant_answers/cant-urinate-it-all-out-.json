            "answer": "Hi,Just a few questions:Do you have any underlying systemic disease like diabetes?Any intake of certain medications like steroids ?Boils are superficial skin infections and they should not present with urinary problems. Your urinary symptoms may be due to a separate cause or condition. Based on what you have posted, an underlying prostate involvement has to be ruled out. An enlarged prostate and a prostatic infection may be determined based on a prostatic secretion culture and a transrectal ultrasound.Discuss these symptoms with your physician as this warrants further evaluation.",

    "question": "I recently had a boil and puss drained from my bottom at the hospital, while i had this problem i also got the problem with peeing, at 1st I could pee but it took its time, but its like I couldnt finish it ( i thought i had though) and then without control, a few drops just pee'd out, now I didnt take make notice as i thought maybe i didnt shake well enough or something like that.Not the case, as I had the boil drained, it has gotten worse, I can only pee with warm water hitting my penis or somewhere near it,\u00a0\u00a0and even then it takes awhile and need a few goes at it.Altho I was able to pee in the toilet this after noon when i got home from the hospital but it takes a long time, I feel the need to pee but I just cant.Is this normal with a boil infection? will it go away, Im seeing a doctor tomorrow, I really hope its nothing serious.",
