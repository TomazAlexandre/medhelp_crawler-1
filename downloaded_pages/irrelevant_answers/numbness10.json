            "answer": "Hello.Can you recall if the vomiting started first or was it the numbness? If she has been vomiting a lot, she is bound to develop vitamin deficiency. A lot of useful vitamins and minerals are lost in vomiting. This deficiency can give rise to the symptoms of numbness.Have other causes, such as diabetes, been ruled out? How old is your daughter?Regards",
