            "answer": "you have all the syptoms i had and iv suffered from anxiety very bad but i had a 6month patch were it was very very bad im still on medication now for it. im on citilopram and another anxiety pill and sleeping tablets. i feel a million times better now my anxiety got that bad i was frightened to leave the bedroom and i no how ur feeling its probly 1 of the worst things iv ever expierenced in my whole lfe. I believe that ther is a trigger for all anxiety and its playin on are mind without us even knowing it. You need to sit and have a good think of whats troubled you or have u been through terrible trauma or stress as this is a great cause. once you find the root cause you have to speak about it and get the weight of ur shoulders and come to terms with facing it head on it only gets worse before better but believe me it does get better i was that bad i was on the verge of not wanting to be here atall. Eventually 1 day we both will be off the meds and learn are own mind exercises which we will be able 2 control are anxiety attacks. Dont let it beat you think ur to strong and you can over come anxiety its yoy making yourself feel like this as your lettin ur mind wonder and run over time soon as u feel a attack coming on or get the syptoms tell urself ur not going to allow it, i hope my expierence can help urs doll msg me when ever you want 2 x",

    "question": "Hi,This is the first time i've wrote on this forum but i've got a question thats ive been wanting to get another opinion on. For the last 8 months i've been constantly worrying about my health, been having panic attacks and started getting very severe acid reflux. Every night i lay in bed worrying, having muscle spazms, tingly limbs, clicking my mouth, very frequent urination (all of which i have read are pretty normal symptoms). My doctor prescribed me with antennex for the anxiety and a 60 day treatment of Nexium for the acid reflux. It turns out that the nexium had some very bad side effects(Jaundice, yellowing of urine, dizziness) and my doctor told me i might be having allergic reactions to it so he took me off it and put me on Ranitidine and also is requesting me to get an endoscopy as he believes it could be a reflux diesese. Every night when i eat a big meal which isn't very much anymore i get really bad reflux and find it very hard to breath for at least 45 minutes after eating. i also am trying to give up smoking as i notice it agravates it really really bad. Anyway for the last 5 days i have woken up with a very heavy head, numb hands and feet all of my usual anxiety symptoms gone and my whole body feels numbed to everything. i can't feel hot and cold very well, i had a ciggarette in the morning and i couldn't taste it or feel it going down my throat at all, i ate a meal at night and could barely feel my reflux even though i knew it was there, The ringing in my ears stopped, i could feel my usual facial numbness on the eye brows but it felt like it was barely happening. one other thing to note is when ive been at work (which is quite a labor intensive job) i have had a prickly pins and needles feeling all over my body where i would normally just sweat. I've had some liver functions and diabetes tests done and he said i didn't have diabetes. He said i had a very high level of billiruben but all my other liver functions were good, he also said i had gilberts syndrome. by the way i am an overweight 23 year old male smoker.\u00a0\u00a0i know that was a long post but i wanted to give anyone that maybe reading a good history of my background with this problem.",
