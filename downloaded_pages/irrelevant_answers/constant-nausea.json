    "question": "Hello, 4 years ago i got food poisoning after eating at a restaurant. I havent vomited since then but i have been plagued by severe nausea, that became constant a year ago. Ive had countless tests done, a barium swallow, ultrasounds, h pylori check test which came back negative, blood tests which came back clean, bottom line no reason was found for my nausea. I struggle with it every single day and it is taking over my life as i cannot go out or do anything, im staying home all the time and im starting to lose hope. I tried homeopathy, i tried everything and nothing seems to offer relief. I also suffer from anxiety. Do you have any idea what this could be and what can i do to feel better? Thank you",
