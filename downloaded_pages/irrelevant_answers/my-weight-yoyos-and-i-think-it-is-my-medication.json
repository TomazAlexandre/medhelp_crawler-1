            "answer": "Now the BMI on a lot of sites can be accuratish for most people, although they're not as good as an actual measurement of your fat rolls. It's not pleasant and a little disturbing to really know how much fat you have- but it could give you a better idea of just how much muscle you have.Also your diet may be a factor. \"Healthy food\" Can be a bit of a misnomer as you need to have a balanced diet, during good intervals, and eat the correct calories. E.G. you cannot just have 1500 calories of pizza once a day. Even if that is the right caloric intake.. that's just not good. Likewise eating nothing but veggies could be a problem if you're not getting enough fats and proteins. Personally I use Fitday.com but there are hundreds of sites available (including this one) that will help you figure out how many calories you are eating, about where you should be (take this number with a grain of salt because some of them are really off), and most of the sites also divide up your calories to show how much are coming\u00a0\u00a0from carbs, fats, and protein. This could help you figure out a better diet for your body type.As far as exercise, maybe you need to boost up the time that you're doing (how long do you exercise for). Or maybe you need to boost up the days at the gym and add an extra day. If available a PT at a gym can really work wonders, they can be expensive. But it's your health so in the long run I think it's worth it.However, because of your age, you are at higher risk for a lot of obesity linked problems. (Like high cholesterol, leading to heart disease) So your doctor needs to listen to you! If he is ignoring you, hasn't tested your testosterone levels or tried to help set you up with someone who could help you with your weight, he is not doing you any favors and you should switch doctors.",

            "answer": "Thanks everyone. I am on cholestrol and blood pressure meds and want to lose this weight to get off of these meds. I workout doing weights/machines and cardio. I eat veggies and fruit and do not drink sugar drinks. I use stevia in my coffee and take multi, fish oil, flax vitamins.It seems I do everything right but nothing works.Next week I am going to try fasting til 2:00 drinking only water or green tea.I heard this shocks your body into using fat for energy. I am not sure how I will have energy to work out at 1:00pm, but will tryYes--I am giving my doctor a chance to do the testosterone test and if not, I am looking for someone else.Cheers",

    "question": "My weight yoyos and I think it is my medication but my doctor does nothing when I tell him. I am also thinking my testosterone levels are low. I work out 3-4 week and try to eat healthy but I cant lose. I think sometimes it is muscle instead of fat, but the results in the mirror do not seem to change.This discussion is related to Ive never been this way before - What should I do?.",
