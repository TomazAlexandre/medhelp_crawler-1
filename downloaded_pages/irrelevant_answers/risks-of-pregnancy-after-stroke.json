    "question": "Hi, i had an intracerebral haemorrage 2 years ago aged 30.The bleed was at the rear section of my left frontal lobe.I have made a good recovery and live an independent life, do have some dissabilities on the right side.I had every test available but no cause was found(possible head injury but not sure).I would like another child but would like to know the risks of this happening again during or after prenancy?I saw 2 neurologists, 1 said there was no risk of this ever happening again pregnancy or not, but the other said he would reccomend that i did'nt get pregnant as the risks were to high and if i did i would need a c-section?I have had 3 healthy pregnancies in the past, no problems with high blood pressure( pregnant or not.), no misscarrigesand no other medical problems.many thanks!",
