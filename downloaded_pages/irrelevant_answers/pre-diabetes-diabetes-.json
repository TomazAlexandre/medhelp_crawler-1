    "question": "Hi I'm a 19 year old mail and play college basketball.\u00a0\u00a0Im 6'8 and about 175 pounds. My grandma had type2 diabetes before she passed and my cousin currently has it. Since yesterday I've been having a on and off itchy light burning on my middle finger or index fingers and also the same with my left foot with just my big toe.it's no numbness or anything like pin and needles but.it's a weird feeling. Just about a month and a half ago I went to\u00a0\u00a0a clinic because of heart palpitations had a ekg and everything was normal. My doctor said it was stress. He didn't say anxiety because it takes about takes about 6 months to diagnose. I do worry about stuff often and maybe that's what's causing itI have no dry mouth, constant bathroom breaks or anything. My mom is getting me a meter just to make sure. DO you guys think I have pre or type 2? Or maybe even 1? I hope not especially 1, thank you. Im very active by the way",
