            "answer": "All right folks. Polyhydramnios is often associated with gestational diabetes. However you say you are negative for diabetes so that cause is ruled out. Most often cases of polyhydramnios are unexplained with no apparent cause. Another cause for poly hydramnios could be a structural abnormality with the baby that makes it difficult for the baby to swallow the fluid. Babies swallow fluid and pee it out. If the baby has trouble swallowing such as in cases with cleft lip and/or cleft palate that can also lead to polyhydramnios.\u00a0\u00a0Esophageal atresia can also lead to polyhydramnios.\u00a0\u00a0One method that can be done to determine if the baby is swallowing is to check by ultrasound for the fetal stomach. If the stomach is seen that is conclusive evidence that the baby is able to swallow.\u00a0\u00a0As I said earlier, most cases of polyhydramnios are of unknown etiology it. To the original poster, just how high was your amniotic fluid index?\u00a0\u00a0The amniotic fluid index, also called the AFI, is semi quantitative method of checking the fluid. It is not a perfect assessment but is reliable. It is checked by measuring a pocket of fluid in four quadrants on moms belly. It is reported as a number typically in centimeters. The normal range is 5 cm to 25 cm under 5 is low and over 25 cm is high. Maybe your AFI is borderline high such as 25 cm, 26 cm. Probably nothing to worry about.",

            "answer": "Also, if the baby has bilateral urinary obstruction, then the fluid would be low because the baby would not be able to process the fluid through the urinary system into the bladder and out and again that would cause low fluid.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, if the baby has unilateral, or one sided obstruction, the fluid could be normal because the other side that is not unobstructed would be functioning normally.",
