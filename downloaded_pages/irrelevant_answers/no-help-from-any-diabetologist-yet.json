            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.None of the blood sugars that you have listed are elevated, therefore I don't believe that you are diabetic at this time. Why did you begin testing your sugar? Was it at the suggestion of a doctor?. When are you checking the pp sugar? It should be done 2 hours after eating. Additionally, a blood sugar of 12 and 18 are extremely low. Normal blood sugar is 65-110. I f your son's sugar falls below that he should be see by a doctor.Cathy",

            "answer": "Thanks cathleen for the reply..I tested my blood sugar after the recommendation of a doctor because I feel hungry after an hour of having meal.yes I am testing my pp sugar after 2 hrs of hving meal. My concern was why my pp sugar is much less than the fasting..it shld be above fasting. And regarding my son, 12 and 18 are not sugar fasting and pp, its insulin fasting and pp..and these insulin levels r more than the range. So why his insulin levels r above the range n his pp sugar is also less than fasting.",
