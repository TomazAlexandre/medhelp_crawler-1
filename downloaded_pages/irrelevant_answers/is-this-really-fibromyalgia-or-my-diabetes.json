            "answer": "Dear Arkylady,I'm sorry you're experiencing pain and the frustration of not getting good medical help. You don't say how your blood-sugar control has been, or if you see a diabetes specialist or just a regular internist.I am a parent of a diabetic, not a medical professional, and this question requires some medical expertise to answer. I know it's difficult to get to a doctor, and Medicare is limiting, but Medicare should cover a visit to an endocrinologist/diabetes specialist. Such a specialist should be able to tell if you are suffering from diabetic neuropathy or not, and help you figure out what to do about it.I have known diabetics who have had neuropathy symptoms and even started losing their eyesight but were able to recover both sensation and sight with good control and care. Please don't think you can't get better, and try to get to a specialist.",

    "question": "I have Type II diabetes and have been told I have fibromyalgia. I get tingling and pain in my arms and legs and low back area and often a burning sensation. My low back and legs become so tender I can hardly stand for anyone to touch them. Is this really fibromyalgia or my diabetes?A couple of months ago I became ill with the flu and was down for nearly a week. My right arm and hand ached a lot. After a few days I noticed my index finger was numb. Since that time it has felt as though a dentist has deadened it. I asked my doctor about it and he just said \"Oh it's your diabetes\". Now what does that mean??? Will it get better, is it permanent and is it going to happen in other fingers, etc.? I am very worried. I don't like having something that to me is this serious to me and be told \"it's just my diabetes\". I don't know what to do. I am disabled and on Medicare and can't afford to go to differnt doctors everytime I have something new come up. If I went somewhere else for help I'm not sure what kind of doctor I would need ot go to. I beleive this is the diabetic neuropathy I've heard of but not sure or what to do about it.",
