My first born was 9lb 1oz and my second was 9lb 13oz so they want to give me a glucose test to find out if I have gestational diabetes with this one (I haven't had it before) and to keep an eye on its growth.I feel fine, no different to my other pregnancies so i didn't know if there were ways to tell? Thanx :-)",
