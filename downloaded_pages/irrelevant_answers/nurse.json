            "answer": "Correct me if I'm mistaken but it appears you are asking about hCG injections AND how to better control your diabetes with or without hCG. Maybe others will come along with additional insight.I'm not strongly versed on weight loss programs but do know diet fads are just that, fads. Injecting synthetic pregnancy hormones to lose weight is just weird and sounds dangerous. This link on hCG is a must read and contradicts all the marketing hype and mumbo-jumbo that is abound on the inet.http://tinyurl.com/hCG-hoax. That's TINYURL [tinyurl *******/hCG-hoax]Here's an excerpt:\"One of the things I always tell people when they ask me about the latest diet pill or program is this: If it REALLY worked, everyone would know about it. Seriously\u2014everyone really would. You'd constantly hear about it on the news, in magazines and newspapers, in statements from reputable organizations, from doctors\u2014from everyone. Why? Because everyone really DOES want a safe and reliable cure for obesity. If that existed in the form of a pill or injection or special food combination, you better believe that no one would be able to truly \"suppress\" that information. Pharmaceutical companies have been searching for this very cure for years, as have university and medical researchers who aren't affiliated with pharmaceutical companies. If weight loss came in a pill, trust me\u2014you'd know about it and you'd probably be taking it. \"The use of hCG injections for weight loss remains a popular treatment,\" says Becky, \"but it is just another dieting scam.\"\"As far as your t2 diabetes, carbs are one enemy to t2'ers and so are starches which are found in potatoes, pasta, white rice, and most breads. Use Google to search on \"foods high in starch\". You don't mention your meal plans so we cannot figure out what you should or should not be eating. Might consider hiring a personal weight loss trainer to get you going on the correct exercise regimen. Good luck",

            "answer": "Dieting fads aside, the following sentence is from my last lab report.\"an HbA1C of 4% to 6% indicates normal glycemic control in non-diabetic patients\" So .1% over is pretty close.Restricting your carb intake to 60 per meal sure worked for me; down 55 lbs in a little over a year. But I adhere to 60 on a very strict basis. If I don't know the carb content I don't eat it. Breakfast is a bowl of multi-grained Cheerios Monday thru Saturday, Sunday bacon (3 strips), scrambled eggs (2) and multi-grained bagel washed down with tomato juice. Lunch is either a deli roast beef sandwich or a bowl of soup, again with a multi-grained bagel .Supper is a pork chop or a NY strip with a vegetable (spinach, asparagus) on Friday and Saturday nights. The other nights a pre-cooked piece of fish,chicken or a frozen bowl (chicken parmesan. shrimp and scallops). All washed down with Coke Zero.\u00a0\u00a0Not much variety here. But absolutely no sweets.Got to go now, it's steak night. Good luck",

Not worth it. My blood sugar readings were never completely out of wack, but my A1C started at 7.84 or there abouts and it came to be between 5 and 6.It is not an easy thing to give up all the things that you love to eat.\u00a0\u00a0But you need to understand what it is doing to your body.",
