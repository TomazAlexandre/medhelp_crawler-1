            "answer": "I would definately say yes you should get it checked out especially since it sounds like it is getting worse. Could be anything from diabetes to a pinched nerve in your back. You should probrably go straight to the source since you do not have insurance, I would see a neurologist since they deal with a specrtrum of disorders similar to this. Your pcp will prolly send you there anyway.Good luck!",

            "answer": "Hi, I think it is something you should be looking into.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think you should muck around with it. For a number of months if I layed down on my left side, I would end up with pins and needles all the way down my arm and into my hand.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if you experienced anything like that but I spoke to a chiropracter about it and he said it was caused by a nerve in my neck.\u00a0\u00a0This feeling only happened when I was on my left side.\u00a0\u00a0So I had some work done on it and it has improved.",

    "question": "for the past month or two i've been dropping things. I didn't really think much of it until a couple weeks ago i noticed a loss of feeling in my hands. Today i realized my feet too are semi numb. it seems to be just my skin, i can feel squeezing but not light to medium touch. I'm a 28 year old female average health. healthy weight, I eat somewhat healthy and exercise a little sometimes more but for a couple months less. I definitely don't drink enough water. should i go to the doctor about this? I've recently lost my health insurance so that's why i haven't gone yet.",
