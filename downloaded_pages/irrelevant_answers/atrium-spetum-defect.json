            "answer": "Dear mom,I would check with the University of Alabama Medical Center.\u00a0\u00a0They have a very good heart program and should be able to give you the best treatment available.\u00a0\u00a0If she is too young for the Amplatz closure device the surgery is fairly straight forward and very low risk.\u00a0\u00a0I can't give you a good reason for why she is having the seizures but I agree with fixing the heart first and then see if the seizures improve.",

    "question": "my daughter at her one yr. check was diagnosed with a heart murmur...7days later she seen a pediatric cardiologist..who said she has asd..that needs to be repaired with open heart surgrey.she started having small seizures(2-5 seconds )shortly after seeing the dr.s.\u00a0\u00a0she had an eeg which came back abnormal.they did not put her on any medication for the seizures.they said she would outgrow or once heart condition is fixed it will resolve.I am concerned on what these seizures are doing to her heart.the asd is 1cm. and her heart is already enlarge.most of the time her hands and feet are blueish/purple with poor capillary refill.what is your thought about the seizures and should we look into getting the heart repair sooner.Her dr. says she meets all the criteria for the patch surgrey but her age...they said they will not do this surgrey on someone so young?? my state (alabama) this procedure yet? I am aware of the fda approving asd amplatzer surgrey.How can I find a dr. that is doing this surgrey? and would she be able to have this done sooner than at the recommended age 3-5....pror to the seizures getting worse and her condition becoming more symptomatic?I really appreciate this site...for the opportunity to find other views on asd....there is not much info out there.thanks........a concerned mother",
