            "answer": "Have you had your thyroid checked?\u00a0\u00a0I had the same symptoms as you years ago when I was 24.\u00a0\u00a0Initially they thought diabetes because my sugars were up - right around where yours are.\u00a0\u00a0Turned out to be hypothyroid.\u00a0\u00a0I couldn't lose weight with exercise, was tired as all get out, and got very shaky if I didn't eat.\u00a0\u00a0Heck, I still get shaky if I don't eat.You're never too young for diabetes or thyroid problems.\u00a0\u00a0My baby is 20 months old and has diabetes.Find a different doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Have them test your T4, T3, free T4, free T3, TSH, and also have them check for Hashimoto's antibodies.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes all your T's (as listed above) will come up in the normal range, but if you have those antibodies attacking your thyroid (like mine) then it still won't work right and you'll have all the symptoms of hypothyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Do a search for hypothyroid symptoms.Again, Find a different doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

    "question": "For the past 2 years I have not felt well on and off.\u00a0\u00a0 I am overweight but despite the doctors giving me aderall, phentermine, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I can't lose more than 5 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0I even have a personal trainer that is shocked that my body fat level is going up even after spending an hour a day with him.\u00a0\u00a0My calories are down to about 1500 a day.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, I am almost passing out of exhastion even after only being awake an hour or two.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor suggested I get tested for narcolepsy, but something just isn't right. If I don't eat within about an hour of waking, I feel sick and irriated, I thought the other day i was going to have a panic attack and got very clamy until I pulled over and ate something.\u00a0\u00a0I often feel good for a few hours and then I feel sick and lousy, it just won't go away.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't been tested for diabetes because my doctor says I am too young and great blood pressure (like an athlete) to have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I just need to find out what is wrong with me. Type one diabetes runs heavily in my family but I think I would know by the age of 32, right?\u00a0\u00a0It would be type 2 diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0 I bought a home testing kit. About 2 1/2 hours after lunch my blood sugar (taken from the finger tip) was 162.\u00a0\u00a045 minutes later it had only fallen to 151.\u00a0\u00a0 Are these levels normal for a nondiabetic?",
