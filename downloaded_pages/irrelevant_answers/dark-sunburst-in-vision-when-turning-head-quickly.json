Especially true if you smoke, have high blood pressure, diabetes, a family histroy of cardiovascular disease or are > 65 years old. Have it check out by an ophthalmologist (Eye MD) first.

            "answer": "Hi,I am 25, male, in good shape (gym excercise 3 times a week, jog). I do not think that is what I have after reading up on it.This is what I think is happening, but it is probably wrong since I am not a MD but perhaps you can use it to make a suggestion.I started getting floaters really bad in my right eye earlier this year, I had had them for 5 years but they just grew all of a sudden (very stressful month coincided with when it happened). Now the floaters are more visible when you move your eye, so I started trying to hold my eyes as synced up as possible with my head and use my head to turn etc. This started to give me sore eyes as I was probably\u00a0\u00a0over-using the muscles behind my eye. So I think what is happening now is that my eye muscles have become too big and are pushing on my optic nerve or something, just like when you push your eye with your finger- because what I see is a lot like\u00a0\u00a0that ring you get when you push the side of your eyeball, but I'm seeing it with my eyes open.Now, would you please tell me if that is complete fantasy or not? I am still going to go to the eye doctor but it'd be nice to know what the heck this is, I am so confused and a bit scared to be honest.",

            "answer": "Hello Mathew82 I don't think your theory is possible. The eye muscles have something like a 100 times the strength needed to move the eyes. So unlike chest and arms muscles that are excersized hard, the eye muscles do not get \"bulked up\" no matter how much you use them. The ring you see in you eye when you push the eye with your finger-tip is an entoptic phenomena and is caused by the fact that the retina reponds not only to light but to traction and pressure. That also is the reason \"arching\" is seen with rapid eye movements in a dark adapted eye.I do approve of your plans to see an ophthalmologist for a specific diagnosis and comprehensive exam.JCH III MD Eye MD",

            "answer": "yeah I was just about to mention that- I usually only see it when I wake up or when I come out of a movie theatre.The frightening thing is, this corresponds with a relatively sudden increase in floaters.",

    "question": "Hi, sometimes when I turn my head quickly a try to look in a fixed direction, I get this weird dark spot in the center of my vision that kind of looks like a dark sunburst stretching from the periphery of my right eye to the center. It seems to be more noticable in the mornings.Do you know what this is?",
