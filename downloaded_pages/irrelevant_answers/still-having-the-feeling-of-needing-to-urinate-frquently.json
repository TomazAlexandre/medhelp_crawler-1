            "answer": "Hello,It is true that infection does not often show up on urine examination if you are already on antibiotics. Wait out a few days and if the symptoms persist then get a repeat urine examination and culture done after stopping antibiotics for a few days. Also since you are a female, if you are sexually active then chances of pregnancy are there and it may cause increased frequency of urination.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
