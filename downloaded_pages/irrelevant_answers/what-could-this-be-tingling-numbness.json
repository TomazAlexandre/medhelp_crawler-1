            "answer": "Hi,I hope you find a good doctor and get things checked out.\u00a0\u00a0Your symptoms are widely ranged and could be a number of things.\u00a0\u00a0You mentioned on your profile you are interested in Diabetes and Hypertension...do you actually have these things?\u00a0\u00a0Really curious.\u00a0\u00a0Reason I ask, because even though the tingling could be anxiety....it could be something else as well. My dad has had hypertension which has led to heart attacks and also has diabetes...your blood sugar could either be high or low at night and this could make you feel the sensations you are having.\u00a0\u00a0I would personally just go to the doctors and get a full check up and have them run all your blood work.\u00a0\u00a0I suffer from anxiety myself...so have felt some of the symptoms you have mentioned. But the diziness comes from my low blood pressure which I am taking lots of iron for .\u00a0\u00a0Also I take Synthyroid for my thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0get that checked as well...but if they run all your blood tests they will check your thyroid gland..just tell them what you are feeling.Wishing you the best of luck and A HUGE WELCOME TO OUR COMMUNITY!MOIRA",
