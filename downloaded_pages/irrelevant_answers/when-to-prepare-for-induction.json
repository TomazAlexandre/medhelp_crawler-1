            "answer": "Baby is considered full term at 37 weeks, that being said 36 is just one week from full term and 99% of babies survive at that point. Its unlikely that if you started at 36 baby would come at exactly 36 weeks. You would at least make it several days into 36 weeks. Plus if baby is not ready it wont matter what you do it wont help.",

            "answer": "Yea, as long as you are doing it the healthy way andnot caster oil...pretty mich anything else should be safe to start that early. Just because you start it then doesn't mean itll work right away.",

            "answer": "I was just worried because I went into pre term labor at 27+5 and they had to stop it so I didn't know if that would mean that when I start trying all those things that it wouldn't take labor very long?Oh I agree I would only try all natural things after seeing what happend to someone on here a few weeks ago.",

            "answer": "It is not likely to do anything unless baby is ready and you are a little dilated and cervix has started to soften. You could try asking for a cervical sweep before they try to induce you? I personally wouldn't try anything until I hit the 37 week mark, which will still give you at least a week of trying other things. I went into preterm labor twice with my daughter and she ended up being almost a week late, despite trying anything and everything natural to start it off by myself!",

    "question": "So went to my first appointment since finding out that I have gestational diabetes and she said she will not let me go past 39 weeks so at 38 weeks we will schedule my induction I've heard some horror story's about induction so I asked her when I could start preparing my body for induction or try and start labor by myself as in sex,squatting,walking,teas ect and she said at 36 weeks. What if these things work wouldnt 36 weeks be to early for baby to come? I asked her if I were to go in labor at that time if they would stop them and she said no because I do have gestational diabetes but anything before that they will. So if you were in my shoes would you start that early?",
