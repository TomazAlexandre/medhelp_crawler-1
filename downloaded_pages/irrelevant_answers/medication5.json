            "answer": "Aww its not your fault and you are definitely not failing your little boy!! Its not a choice because I'm sure, like myself, if you could be completely healthy you would be! Just means you're fighting harder than healthy mums which means more pain but also when your little bubba is here, it'll be worth all of the pain I'm sure. Try and look at it positively and keep strong xx",

Mine are for diabetes, depression, anxiety, and now headaches. Taking care of you is taking care of baby. Good luck momma",
