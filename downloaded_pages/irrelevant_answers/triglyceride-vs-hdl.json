    "question": "I have read several articles relating to this.\u00a0\u00a0From what I understand, a high triglyceride level ALONE may not be a great contributor to heart problems...but combined with a low HDL can be.\u00a0\u00a0My triglyceride level is 459 and HDL 25.5.Would a simple \"low fat diet\" help this (limiting my fat to 40- 45 grams per day)?\u00a0\u00a0My Doctor gave a list of things to definitely not eat which amounts to almost 0 grams of fat allowed.I always heard the body needs a certain amount of fat to function, should I completely cut out fat??I have absolutely no energy, shortage of breath after exertion...would reducing the triglyceride level or raising the HDL level help this?Thanks,Charles",
