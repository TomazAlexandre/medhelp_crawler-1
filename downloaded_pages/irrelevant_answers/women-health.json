            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Dry skin is the commonest cause of generalized itching. Scratching can cause sores.\u00a0\u00a0Applying a moisturizer and using only soaps that are gentle on the skin is helpful in this case.\u00a0\u00a0(If you have blisters at tip of fingers and dry skin then you need to rule out certain conditions such as diabetes, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and malnutrition.) Hypothyroidism too causes dry skin. Please get your thyroid function checked. It could also be due to overuse of AC and heaters. Some fresh air every day with lots of fluids should help.Generalized itching can be due to allergy. Common allergens are pollen, mold, dust, pet dander, synthetic fiber, food, cosmetics (powders, soaps, shampoos\u2014see if anything was recently changed) or drugs. You must get an allergy test done, either a skin test or RAST, to know what you are allergic to. Fungal infections like tinea corporis and tinea cruris too cause whole body itching along with genital itching. Liver problems too can cause generalized itching.If the itch is only in the exposed part, it can also be due to sun allergy.Menopause (not in your case) or hormonal imbalance due to PCOD is another reason for this. Low estrogens are supposed to be the cause. Try a diet rich in estrogens. Hormone replacement therapy can also help a few. Worms are another cause of both anal and body itch. Pubic and body lice can be another cause.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
