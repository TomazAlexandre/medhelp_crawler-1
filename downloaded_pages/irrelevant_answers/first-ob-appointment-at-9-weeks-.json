            "answer": "My midwife usually doesn't take anyone until they're at least right weeks. None weeks is perfect. You'll probably get a pap smear, a breast exam, and have to give some blood to get tested.You'll want to know your medical history, if any generic issues run in your family (anything from downs to diabetes) etc etc.They'll ask you when your last period was to estimate your due date, and ask for a urine sample. You may or may not get an ultrasound, and you might be able to hear baby's heartbeat.Good luck and congrats!",

            "answer": "Yeah a lot of offices won't see you until 8-9wks. They'll probably have you pee in a cup. Might take blood and do a pap smear. Take your family history and determine your due date. They may or may not do an ultrasound that varies by office. They'll also take your blood pressure and weight. It's one of the longer appointments you'll have.",
