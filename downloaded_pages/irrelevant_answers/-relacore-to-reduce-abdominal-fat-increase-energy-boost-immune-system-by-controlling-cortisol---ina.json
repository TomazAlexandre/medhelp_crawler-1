            "answer": "I heard it about the metabolic syndrome from my big shot hepatologist, and he's not one of those who blames everything on treatment, quite the contrary. While on treatment we rightly complain about the ribavirin but as far as I'm concerned it's the interferon that has the potential for causing the longer term and potentially permanent side effects by altering our metabolism and immune system. Don't know if Relacore, or something similar will help, but now that Western Medicine is pretty much through with me as an SVR, time to start researching elsewhere. That is not to say I'm discounting more conventional approaches and probably will end up on a statin pretty soon. Hopefully some of those more knowledgeable in vitamins, supplements, etc, will chime in on Relacore. BTW in case you missed it, scroll down to the thread titled \"supplements\". A lot of good stuff there.Be well,-- Jim",

            "answer": "hey jim good stuff and hope you are well. i would be very interested in any more info on this. I believe HCV alone can cause the metabolic syndrome even without ever treating. i have many of the same problems you mention, abdom fat,lipid disorders, boarderline high BP, glucose between 103-115 fasting (i think this is pre-diabetic?) and as you know i have not tx'd yet. this just re-inforces the fact that if you can wait to tx then you should. perhaps the chance of doing tx for a shorter duration with the new drugs will not allow these harsh drugs to do so much damage. anyway i have tried several different supplement regimens. my latest which is alot less complicated then others i tried has made me feel really good, morning: i take a multi without iron, complete mineral without iron, CoQ-10 60mg,\u00a0\u00a0liver detoxifier & regenerator by Now. afternoon: i juice \"organic\" carrots,beets,spinich,apples,pears,etc\u00a0\u00a0and konsyl fiber in water at night. the liver detox/regen product sold under the brand name NOW was developed by a doctor that i know here in NJ. after years of travel in asia and plant study in different countries he put this formula together. after clinical trials he gave the formula to the NOW company for FREE to help people with liver problems, especially hepatitis. out of all the sups so far this has made me feel the best. and not sure but i think the CoQ-10 has helped lower my BP, for the last month my BP has dropped to 110/75. before taking it, it was always around 135-140 over 80-90, and these higher #'s were with taking a BP med, 40mg micardis. of course the better BP could be from me exercising more and watching diet. or a combo of everything. the bottom line is i feel ok now and do not want to ruin that by starting tx at this time. i'm awaiting the results of the CRS (cirrhosis risk score) test and will be seeing dr \"A\" in boston for a fibroscan in the future then i will make a decision.",

            "answer": "Did not mean to imply at all that my doctor was hiding something. Probably a wrong choice of words reflecting my frustration that most of what I've found about regarding interferon's effects came after I treated and not during or before. But this is not specific to my doctor who I respect, it is fairly common and has been discussed here ad naseum. We just aren't told a lot going into treatment. Would it have made any difference to me if I had been told? No, because as a stage 3, I would have weighed the risks and rewards and treated anyway. But yes, I'll repeat the statment again without the misleading use of the word admitted: My hepatologist recently told me that interferon treatment can accelerate the metabolic syndrome. I'm surprised you're suprised with this statement. It's been discussed here for some time by Double Dose and others. I don't know if HR is on board or not on this, but I wouldn't be surprised by some of his comments on things we should do after treatment. I doubt if all his comments were directed solely at the residual affects of the virus. But regardless, I know what my doctor said and I know what I'm experiencing. You might also want to go over to the Janis Board. There is an interesting thread now going on about treatment and blood lipids.-- Jim",

    "question": "Saw a TV ad for \"Relacore\" and visited a few web sites.In short, apparently some recent university studies show a relationship between the stress hormone, Cortisol, and abdominal fat -- the kind of fat that increases the risks of heart attacks.Relacore and similiar acting products like Cortidrene, Therastress, Cortislim, etc. claim to reduce abdominal fat by controlling the stress hormone cortisone partly through a mild sedative effect of one of its active ingredients, Magnolia Bark.Since treatment I've noticed a worsening lipid profile as well as more of a propensity for fat to accumulate on my abdomen than pre-treatment. My liver specialist recently admitted that interferon is know to accelerate the metabolic syndrome which is responsible for higher triglicerides, type II diabetes, abdominal fat and a host of other not so good stuff. Therefore my interest in Relacore or similar supplements. I flagged \"Ina\" (moniker Eisbein) because I believe she recently mentioned doing some research on stress hormones.Here are some sites from a quick \"Google\". I know most of them are selling something but would like to get anyone's experience and/or comments. Or at least your take on the list of ingredients, whether anything is good, harmful, etc.http://www.relacore.tv/ingredients.htmlhttp://www.carter-reedcompany.com/relacore/http://stress-related-weight-gain.equalitynutrition.com/?source=google/relacoreAny input appreciated.-- Jim",
