            "answer": "He needs to join a recovery group for people who have a mental illness and an issue with alcoholism. He cannot recover fully until he stays off drinking but that would take a recovery group such as AA but one designed for people with mental illness. Also what medication is he on? The older antipsychotics from Thorazine to Haldol don't work so well and are twice as likely to create movement disorders that are temporary or permanent ones such as tardive dyskinesia which in myself is as bad as Parkinsons'. The new ones the atypicals from Risperal through Abilify are much better. Of course they still have a risk of tardive and diabetes. Fortunately there are medications in study that can't cause these conditions. I am on glycine, a glutamate antagonist in Phase II FDA study. These medications will be the antipsychotics they will use once they are released in the next 5 years as well as other study medications. Let me know how your friend is doing and what medication he is on. I could provide you with information andI am an advocate as well.",
