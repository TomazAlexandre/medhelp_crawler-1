            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for posting.Vitamin D deficiency will not cause neuropathy. Neuropathy can occur due to Vitamin B 12 deficiency and diabetes, apart from thyroid dysfunction and nerve compression and nerve damage.Vitamin D deficiency occurs due to inadequate exposure to sunlight. Calcific tendonitis occurs due to inflammation of tendon due to calcium deposits. Calcium is secreted from the cells resulting in calcium deposits. These deposits can impinge upon a nerve resulting in neuropathy.Thanks",

    "question": "I have just been diagnosed with low Vit D. I have burning feet and tingling legs, feet and hands. My neurologist says i have ideopathic neuropathy and nerve damage ( i have had two spinal fusions) as well as radiculopathy. He suggested I might have diabetes but the blood work showed Vit d deficiency. Can this cause neuropathy? I also have stiff joints and have had calcific tendonitis this year. Is this all connected?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your help. I feel I need a more holistic approach rather than seeing a neurologist, rheumatologist and endocrinologist separately! ( as well as a shoulder specialist or the calcific tendonitis!)",
