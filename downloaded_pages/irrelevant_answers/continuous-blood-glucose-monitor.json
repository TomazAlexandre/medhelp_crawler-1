            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0During pregnancy, I'm sure you already know, the tighter control you have the better, and a CGMS can certainly help with that.\u00a0\u00a0What insurance do you have?\u00a0\u00a0Many don't cover it completely, but you can apply and appeal any rejection.\u00a0\u00a0Many people have convinced their insurance to cover the device and supplies after a lot of effort and persistence, so it is possible.\u00a0\u00a0JDRF has information on how to go about this:http://www.jdrf.org/index.cfm?page_id=106514Basically the message is to be persistent and don't give up hope just because they tell you no the first time or the second time.\u00a0\u00a0And even without a CGMS you can have a very successful pregnancy and healthy baby.\u00a0\u00a0You will need to test much more often than you do even now.\u00a0\u00a0Nicole Johnson Baker is the most notable example of a successful pregnancy as a type 1.\u00a0\u00a0She's a former Miss America, diagnosed in 1993.\u00a0\u00a0She's been involved in studies and does many presentations on the topic.\u00a0\u00a0So don't be discouraged even if the CGMS path fails.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

            "answer": "Hello,I am not a medical professional either, but I am a Type 1 diabetic - veteran of 33+ years - and a mother of TWO! My very first pregnancy was long before CGMS technology was available and I have a tendancy to take sharp bloodsugar drops. I delivered a very healthy little girl. She was 5 weeks early but that was due to pre-eclampsia and not my diabetes. My son was delivered at term three years later and he was a model of good health, too.My success was directly related to how often I tested my bloodsugar (manually). Yours can be the same situation. Remember, the Minimed pump is still not a true \"artificial pancreas\" - it will NOT adjust your insulin dose based upon your bloodsugar readings. You will need to make adjustments to the pump after receiving alerts from the CGMS/pump. My Minimed rep and Drs tell me that a true smart version of the pump is in development. It's a ways off though, especially with FDA clearance requirements.Be confident in yourself. Test before and 2 hr pp and whenever you do anything unusual (i.e. outside your usual routine). That could be 10x per day, but your baby and you will be glad that you do this.It sounds like you are a very conscientious woman and I think that's great. Take heart and just plan to be vigilent and to stay in close communication with your doctor. And remember... Before pumps and the CGMS many diabetic women like us delivered healthy children.P.S.I here that now the CGMS has obtained FDA approval that many large HMO and PPO insurance systems are looking closely at adding the CGMS to their list of covered equipment.",

            "answer": "Hey there!I just happened upon a JDRF site that discusses a CLINICAL TRIAL program for CGMS as well as a reference blog for advice on how to approach your insurance company to allow coverage on an exception basis for the CGMS. Here's the link: http://www.healthyupdates.com/diabetes/expert/content?cid=994&ctid=10.Hope this helps!Anne",

    "question": "Hello. I found out I was a type 1 diabetic about 6 years ago when I turned 20. I started managing the disease with about 5 - 6 injections daily, but when I got engaged in 2005, I decided it would be a good idea to try the insulin pump to have better control over my sugars, especially with the possibility of an unplanned child. The pump has helped a lot, and I am very glad I got it. My blood sugars are much better, but they are not perfect. My husband and I have decided that we would like to start trying to have a baby. We are very excited, but also very aware of the risks involved with being diabetic and conceiving. I want to have a very healthy baby.I recently learned about the continuous blood glucose monitor offered by MiniMed. I have a MiniMed pump and was excited to learn that they had this new device available. Then I would know exactly when my blood sugar was getting to high or to low and I could take care of it that very second. Especially when I am trying conceive and during the pregnancy I think I would really help make sure I had a healthy baby.I contacted MiniMed about it. The found out that my insurance does not cover the device, nor the monthly supplies for it. My husband and I are not able to afford such an expensive device, and we certainly could not keep up with the cost of the monthly supplies to use it.It is so important to us to have a healthy baby.MiniMed suggested I check for the possibility of charity as they have no programs for assistance. I have checked with about 10 - 15 companies and so far have reached only dead ends. Does anyone know of anyone I can contact for help??",
