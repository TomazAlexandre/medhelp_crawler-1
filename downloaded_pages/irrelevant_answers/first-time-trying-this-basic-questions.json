    "question": "So I've just begun this dieting / exercising and downloaded this app to help (so far so good I think). I'm just wondering about the calories \"banked\" that shows up on the summary calendar? I figured you need to burn more cals that you consume to lose weight over time, but what happens if you don't consume your cal allotment for the day?Also, I have type 1 and SLE (I suppose this makes some kind of difference in this whole endeavor).",
