            "answer": "None of us on here are doctors and just speak from our own experience as diabetics but that seems very odd to me. That is a very high c peptide for a type 1, meaning she is producing a lot of her own insulin. I have no idea what that second number is. If I had to hazard a wild guess I would say she is actually type 2, because they produce a lot of their own insulin but have trouble using it due to insulin resistence. (131 is a high fasting). I would definitely talk to her endo, ask him to explain the numbers and ask him to test her for antibodies. Type 1 is an antibody condition, and type 2 is not, it is a clear determinant of type. I could be way off here, and perhaps someone else will have an opinion. But bottom line is your doctor needs to explain these readings to you.",

            "answer": "Sounds like she is still in the honeymoon phase. The longer this lasts the easier her diabetes will be to manage -\u00a0\u00a0she is still making some of her own insulin. I would ensure that she is taking adequate amounts of Vitamin D - one study showed\u00a0\u00a0that 75 per cent of children are deficient in Vit d at the time of their diagnosis of T 1 diabetes. . Are there any studies available to her to enroll in to perhaps save any remaining islet function? Go to the Children with Diabetes website for any possible studies available.Good Luck to youCIndy, mom of Kate - Age 16, dx at age 5",

            "answer": "That is an extremely high c-peptide which is usually a determinant of Type 2. I've never heard of a type one\u00a0\u00a0in their honeymoon phase producing that much insulin. There's always a first time for everything with diabetes, but I would think honeymoon with 3.5 c-peptide. A 35 makes me think type 2. A simple antibody test will determine type and is very important to proceed with the correct treatment. I would recommend talking to an endo about the c-peptide and doing antibody testing.",
