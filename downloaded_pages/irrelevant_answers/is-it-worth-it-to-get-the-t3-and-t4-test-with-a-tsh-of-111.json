            "answer": "Your TSH is textbook perfect. However, TSH is a pituitary hormone and not a direct measurement of thyroid activity. It is the signal that the pituitary sends to the thyroid. People with Hashimoto's, an auto-immune thryoid disease that eventually causes hypothryoidism, will have varied TSH throughout the early stages of the disease.I'd ask for the FT3, FT4 tests, just to be sure.If you have any neck swelling or difficulty swallowing, fullness in throat, then I'd ask for the antibody tests, TGab and TPOab as well as a thyroid ultrasound.I don't know your symptoms, but other symptoms that can mimic hypothyroidism are parathyroid disease and diabetes. Lupus can also be similar to Hashimoto's.:) Tamra",

            "answer": "Very important to do as Tamra suggested and get FT3 and FT4 tested in order to determine if thyroid is an issue.\u00a0\u00a0These are the biologically active thyroid hormones that regulate metabolism and many other body functions.\u00a0\u00a0Also if you get testing done, keep in mind that just having FT3 and FT4\u00a0\u00a0within the low limits is frequently not enough to alleviate symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms are all important.\u00a0\u00a0In my opinion the very best way to treat a thyroid patient is to test and adjust FT3 and FT4 levels with whatever meds are required to alleviate symptoms, without regard for TSH.\u00a0\u00a0Frequently this necessitates FT3 and FT4 being in the upper part of their very broad ranges.Here is an article you might find worthwhile.http://www.hormonerestoration.com/Thyroid.html",
