            "answer": "Hi there,Are you talking about foul smell in body or foul smelling passage of gas? Poor hygiene is the commonest cause of foul smell from the body. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, serious liver or kidney disease, overactive thyroid glands are few conditions which can lead to foul body odour.Foul smelling flatulence can be due to number of conditions like excessive consumption of foods rich in starch, cellulose, complex sugars, bacterial overgrowth in small intestine, irritable bowel syndrome, malabsorption, celiac disease etc.I will advise you to avoid excessive consumption of these foods. Take a healthy diet. Go for a walk every day. If the problem is bothering you too much consult a local health care provider. I do hope it helps. Do write to us again.Take care and regards!",
