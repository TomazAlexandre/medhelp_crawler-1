    "question": "Hi all....I had my appts. with Johns Hopkins last week and I'm so happy I went there.My slides from my last FNA, done 3-4-10,\u00a0\u00a0that showed atypia susp. for papillary cancer,were sent to Johns Hopkins for their cytopathologists to review. I met with an endocrinologist whospecializes in the thyroid (not diabetes) and also had another ultrasound and bloodwork.****The doctors at Johns Hopkins found my nodule biopsy to be BENIGN upon review****I was expecting to be set up for surgery there, so when I got the wonderful news I was shocked!I live in a small town in Virginia and have very little choice of surgeons that take my insurance and I was not comfortable with the local surgeon I had seen. That's when I decided to seek treatment at Johns Hopkins and I'm so happy I did! The doctors, nurses and staff of Johns Hopkins are among the best in the world. Everyone I encountered there was professional, caring and compassionate. And, I never felt rushed no matter how many questions I asked!I just wanted to share my news and experience with Johns Hopkins. I also wanted to say THANK YOU to the people on this forum who have taken the time to answer my posts and share their wisdom and experiences.",
