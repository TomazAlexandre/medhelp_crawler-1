            "answer": "Diabetes is a very serious disease. i am 24 and I have had diabetes for 16yrs. In the beginning I honestly was young and stupid and didn't really take care of myself and now I have two kids and I can't even take care of them bymyself due to the many complications this disease gave me. I have neuropathy in my legs and feet, I have retinopathy in my eyes, and I have trouble in my digestive system. I can see out of my eyes, but they go foggy sometimes. The nerves in my legs and feet are pretty much dead, I can't tell if water is hot. I have a third degree burn on my lower leg from a heating pad because I didn't feel the heat. The nerves in my digestive system are dead, so whatever I eat, runs right through me. I can't go out to eat anymore because I always have to use the bathroom right away. It is the worst feeling I have ever felt. I get depressed alot which keeps me from interacting with my children. Your nephew can avoid many complications as he gets older, but he needs to take control of the diabetes. He sounds just like me, going in and out of the hospital and going to icu. It really dangerous and scary. I pray he takes care of himself and if you need any advice on anything just email me at ***@**** know alot about diabetes, just ask and I will try to help with any questions you have about it. Has he ever thought about getting the insulin pump? It is amazing!",
