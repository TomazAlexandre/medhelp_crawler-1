            "answer": "Since your husband is slender it's likely he has structural reasons for his snoring and episodes of stopping breathing. If he has sleep apnea, it can usually be successfully treated with with a cpap machine, some try oral devices or surgery. Sleep apnea is worsened by alcohol. Sleep apnea causes progressive health damage and puts one at increased risk of cardiac problems and stroke. It puts one at increased risk of an accident, and robs of energy and mental acuity. It's also been reported to contribute to impotence and decreased libido, also problems with diabetes and high blood pressure.Tell him he is far too young to be satisfied with this life and that if he lives, he will only get progressively worse without treatment. Encourage him to see what life can be without suffocating and losing oxygen to the brain repeatedly each night. He is fortunate to have you, as those who live alone often go most of their lifetime undiagnosed. Sure hope he listens to you - at least it will be on him if he doesn't.",

            "answer": "I have Type 2 and sleep apnea. I can tell you from experience that getting the sleep study and getting my own cpap has made a huge difference for me. I forgot what it was like to get an actual night's sleep. It also lowered my blood pressure and made me feel better overall. He will be able to think more clearly too.Trust me, it makes a huge difference!Eric",

            "answer": "Hi Tammy, are you sure it is Type 1 and not Type 2 diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Usually Type 1 is found earlier in life......Drinking alcohol can deffinetly make sleep apnea and snoring worse because it causes the muscles to relax and make obstruction easier.\u00a0\u00a0Smoking also increases snoring and/or sleep apnea because it irritates and causes inflammation of the nasal and oral (pharyngeal) tissues.\u00a0\u00a0Usually sleep docs recommend no alcohol 4 hours before bed time.I would deffinetly recommend a sleep study ASAP.From my knowledge diabetes does not have any association with sleep apnea or snoring, however, diabetes is a cardiac risk factor and so is sleep apnea if left unstreated.From your description I would wager your husband has moderate to severe sleep apnea.\u00a0\u00a0Usiing a CPAP will probably allow you both to sleep in the same room again...though my wife complains the CPAP unit is too loud...which it is probably just needing to be replaced as they are usually fairly quiet (especially compare to snoring!)Go and google the terms: sleep apnea cardiac riskyou will see many hits on this topic.I am a respiratory therapist",

            "answer": "thanks for the advice...yeah, it's definitely Type I, he was hospitalized for awhile and is completely insulin dependent and on a pump now...he's one of the few people diagnosed late in life...I can't find any info on Type I and sleep apnea, but it sounds like regardless, he needs to talk to his doctor and maybe do this sleep study.thanks everyone for their input!",

    "question": "My husband is 39, and was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 35. He is not overweight, in fact, he was always slender but lost even more weight after getting diabetes, so he's very slim. He snores so heavily, we hardly ever sleep in the same room anymore, because I just can't take it. He stops breathing quite often, and \"jerks\" awake with a loud snore frequently. He also drinks and smokes, although he has cut down, his snoring is worse after he's had alcohol. I am wondering how serious this is, what should I tell him, and is sleep apnea even more of a danger in people with Type 1 diabetes?",
