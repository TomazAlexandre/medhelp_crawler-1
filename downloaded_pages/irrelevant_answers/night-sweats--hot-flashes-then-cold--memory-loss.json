            "answer": "I would say your husband needs some blood testing for , FULL BLOOD COUNT, DIABETES, AND THYROID PROFILE.I have thyroid disease and i can get night sweats, it sounds to me like this could be the endocrine system, causing this problem, so i would have the tests to rule out if its endocrine like thyroid etc.You can get sweats and go confused with diabetes,Also get your husband to have an IGE blood test for allergies, when the problems arise again.Good luckNicola",

    "question": "For the past four years, my husband has started having weird symptoms each year from March to about May.\u00a0\u00a0He has night sweats, is hot then cold, his normally quick mind is slow and sluggish, he feels nauseated at times, is very irritable, just generally feels awful.\u00a0\u00a0This is especially true if the weather is wet.\u00a0\u00a0I think it is some type of mold allergy, but he went last spring to an allergy doctor who wouldn't even test him because she said by looking at him she could tell he does not have allergies.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms clear up in the summer and do not return until spring. What in the world could this be?\u00a0\u00a0We are desperate for answers!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
