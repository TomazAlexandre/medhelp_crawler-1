            "answer": "HI,I am afraid I do not know the answer to your question regarding disability. I have many patients with diabetes who have successfully applied for disability coverage, and they all have severe neuropathy and/or vision problems to qualify. I do not think diabetes will exclude you from it. Try speaking with a local representative at the nearby hospital or a helpline listed on the disability forms as they will likely have the most accurate and up to date information. Thank you for writing on behalf of your Mom, I hope all goes well for you both. By the way, please have your Mom also refrain from driving if she is having severe hypoglycemia--keep her and others safe as well.Take care.",

    "question": "Just looking for some help here. My mother works at a pharmacy and is 64 years old, single, and has diabetes now for 35 years. She has neropothy so bad she hardly can walk. her legs are brown with ulcers, scabs, and open wounds. Her managers are begging her to quit but she is really scared with no insurance. She falls alot and is currently having to have help (low blood sugar) about 2 times a week. Shes has had numerous falls and gets dizzy easily. To add to that, she has had three surgeries because of retinopothry (forgive me if there are misspellings), and only has one kidney with ulcers and is the size of a stone! I have finally talked her into applying for disability and Lord knows if anyone needs it... It's her. But everyone is telling us that she will have to quit first and then i hear that it is very hard to get disability for diabetes! All advice is well appreciated here if you have any similar situations.",
