            "answer": "Yes, diabetics can and usually DO have normal and healthy babies. I am a type 1 diabetic since childhood and I have two healthy children. If a diabetic woman keeps her glucose levels tightly controlled, pregnancy is usually uneventful.Any risks would be if you let your glucose levels go high and remain high. This can cause damage to you, as you know, and the baby is at risk of damage if glucose levels are uncontrolled, especially during the first trimester when initial development is happening, and during the last trimester when the placenta needs to be well-nourished by the small blood vessels in your body in order to sutain the larger unborn baby.Most doctors now recommend that their diabetic patients try to have good glucose control for a period of about 3 months before getting pregnant. There is no magic reason for this 3-month good control other than in 3 months, you have not only developed good habits, but your body is optimally healthy if your glucose control has been good during that time. Your own doctor can tell you what a1c he wants to see you maintain, but you certainly should be below 7 in order to ensure a healthy pregnancy.I want to suggest that you go to the www.jdrf.org website and click on the Online Diabetes Support Team link. Send us a note saying that you would like to communicate with one of our volunteers about pregnancy, and you will be matched up with someone like me who has been there and done that. Then you and the volunteer can communicate privately and more in detail about your concerns, and the volunteer can \"walk\" with you through a pregnancy if you do decide to have a baby.There is no substitute for a good doctor's advice, but sometimes our fears are best put to rest by peers who have been through what we are concerned about. I wish you the very best luck. I have no regrets at all about becoming\u00a0\u00a0a mom, and I wish you the same good experience.",

            "answer": "Thanks Christina.Your reply was a good help for me to think about pregnancy issues that I am still trying to reconcile.Can you brief me more about the kidney problems that you are facing? I have read that these problems are reversible? Is it true? Also, that high BP affects the smooth-functioning of the kidney, however, if detected at early stages these problems are reversible. Can Medhelp please advice me on this issue.How did you manage to have an hba1c of 5? I must say its excellent control... Are you insulin dependent or do use pump/s?Thanks in advance for your forth-coming reply.",

    "question": "Hi,I have been a diabetic for 21 years of my life (diagonosed at age 3) and I am thinking of a marriage now. However, I have worries about complications during pregnancy. I would like to know that can diabetics give birth to normal & healthy babies? What do you suggest and advice on daily plans, excercise, and hba1c control? How critical is it for us (me & my partnet) to have a planned pregnancy? Please give us some feedback and will appreciate the same.Thanks.- P",
