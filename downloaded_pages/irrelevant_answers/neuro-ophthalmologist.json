            "answer": "Hi,Yes the possibility of migraines with aura is very strong. I am not really sure what the opthamologist is referring to by stress to the optic nerve. It could mean pressure on the optic nerve due to raised intra ocular pressure. But this condition can be easily diagnosed by an opthalmological exam.You can by all means consult a neuro-opthalmologist. A migraine specialist may also be able to help you as migraine seems more likely, but this is something a neuro-opthalmologist also will be able to diagnose.",

            "answer": "Hi,Demyelination of optic nerve fibers can occur due to a condition known as optic neuritis or demyelinating optic neuropathy. It can be caused by infections, inflammatory diseases like lupus, ischemic vascular diseases like due to diabetes and MS.It is important to know the exact cause of demyelination of the optic nerve fibers which is why a neuro-opthalmological exam is essential.Do keep us posted on the results of your exam.Thanks",

    "question": "Hello:I lost vision in my left eye for 5mins over 6 mons ago.\u00a0\u00a0Ever since then I have been suffering with visual disturbances in both eyes...mostly zig zags and stars.\u00a0\u00a0This occurs early in the mornings, 3-4 days a week, sometimes accompanied by a headache or extreme eye pain (very, very painful). Other times, I experience dizziness or double vision.I have seen an ophthalmologist who claims I have abnormalities to my optic nerve in both eyes.\u00a0\u00a0He describes this as a \"stress to the optic nerve.\"\u00a0\u00a0After reading many articles and websites, I am assuming I have mirgraines with aura.\u00a0\u00a0No one has officially diagnosed me with this, but I am sure this what I am experiencing.I was instructed to see a neurologist. He is a nice guy who has not been able to help me.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, I am not sure he believes anything is wrong with me.\u00a0\u00a0So, my question is, has anyone seen a neuro-ophthamologist?\u00a0\u00a0Was this helpful?\u00a0\u00a0Would you suggest this for someone like myself?",
