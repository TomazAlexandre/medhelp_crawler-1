            "answer": "In short, working with an endocrinologist is a great idea for someone with questionalble test results.I have diabetes and see an endo for that. He identified thyroid nodules and I just had a thyoidectomy.\u00a0\u00a0In my opinion, a good doctor recommends a specialist for complicated issues like thyroid and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My primary did that 20 years ago for the diabetes. The more I read the more grateful I am to have had him as I have seen primary's make unfortunate mistakes in care of both of these issues.When my endo identified the nodules and had FNAs done, he also sent the results out for second opinion from\u00a0\u00a0U of Penn path dept.\u00a0\u00a0When those results came back, he recommended surgery, but also offered to refer me for a second opinion to another endo.\u00a0\u00a0I respect him for that, and am thrilled that I have been blessed with really smart docs with normal egos.Good luck.I would feel more comfortable seeing an endo if I had test results that were that out of range,",

    "question": "An allergist checked my thyroid because I complained of itching/hives. My TSH was normal 1.58 (.40-5.50). But my Thyroglobulin Antibodies were high 154 (<20). It was suggested I follow up with my Primary Care doctor because I have other symptoms that seem consistent with thyroid problems. This doctor, however, dismissed the lab results completely, saying the TSH level was all that mattered. I asked about T3 & T4 (which were not checked), and she said these tests were unreliable anyway. Should I seek a second opinion with an endocrinologist?My symptoms over the last several years include:feeling of fullness in the neck/throat (along with neck and jaw pain)slow stomach emptying/refluxitchinginsomniaanxietylow energy - tiredness upon wakingAlso, my mother has always had thyroid problems. Not sure if the family history is relevant.",
