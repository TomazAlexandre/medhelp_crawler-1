            "answer": "My first question would be if they treat by labs only or by a combination of labs and symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0That's a biggie.\u00a0\u00a0If they treat by labs only, then start looking for endo #4.Do they specialize in thyroid disease or is their practice focused on diabetes or other endocrine diseases?\u00a0\u00a0That's another biggie.Since you have experience in this area, ask how they communicate with patients.\u00a0\u00a0Does the dr call or do they have the nurses do it?\u00a0\u00a0Do they call you with test results or do they make you wait a month or two until your next appt to get them?\u00a0\u00a0Do they offer copies of your test paperwork, gladly give you copies when you ask, or do you have to fight for it?Ask what tests they normally run.\u00a0\u00a0Most will just run the standard TSH, FT4 and antibodies.\u00a0\u00a0You know you've got a keeper if they run TSH, FT4, FT3, antibodies, along with a full nutritional panel including ferritin, Bvits and D.\u00a0\u00a0I mention the nutritional panel because so many thyroid folks also have nutritional deficiencies.\u00a0\u00a0Not like that's a secret, although many docs won't even consider it.\u00a0\u00a0I'd especially focus on the Bvits because, in another one of your posts, it sounds like you might have a deficiency by the symptoms you were talking about.Do they offer options for treatment?\u00a0\u00a0How do they feel about alternative treatments and/or nutritional supplements?\u00a0\u00a0Of course, that's more of a biggie for me rather than most people, but its something to think about and lets you know how open-minded they'd be to your questions.How much time do they spend with each patient?\u00a0\u00a0The StupidEndo I was seeing scheduled her appts 15 minutes apart, whether it was a new patient visit or not.That's all I can think of for now.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, a good part of this is also going by feel, but the questions help.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and lets hope this one is a keeper! :)",

I meet endo #3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She seems promising-spent about 1 hr 15 minutes w/me.\u00a0\u00a0 told me i'm in a place where i need frequent contact and she'll see me every 4 weeks right now while i try to feel better.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0she ordered TSH, FT4, FT3, thyroglobulin but not a full nutritional panel.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0also added blood sugar since my levels have been a bit elevated.\u00a0\u00a0 i did ask her about deficiencies after seeing how many people on this board have them, but she said it would be rare for someone my age to have any.\u00a0\u00a0 although, i have to say, since i started beefing up the B-complex, i'm feeling much better .\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0her practice is diabetes and thyroid, but she has a LOT of experience w/thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0 she's different from endo #2 in her RAI protocol, which makes me nervous...she's by the book .\u00a0\u00a02 years in a row of withdrawal.",
