            "answer": "Yes. You need to find a facility that will give him a 3T MRI and an MRA, with dye contrast.A CT scan is not appropriate for evaluating bleeding within the brain, except in an emergency when an MRI is not available.They made a decision not to relieve the bleeding. I can't second guess this, but they probably were not a trauma center and did not have a qualified surgeon on hand.Recovery takes a long time, and involves much discomfort.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The treatment given in case of a brain clot depends on several factors. If the patient is seen within the first three hours of stroke and clot is detected, then drugs are given to dissolve the clots. In some patients steroids are given to reduce swelling and a wait and watch policy is adopted. In others the clot is surgically removed. Treatment also depends on the position of clot, age of patient, other concomitant conditions like diabetes, brain injury etc.It would be more beneficial to take a second opinion with your father\u2019s CT scan report and it may benefit to get a MRI done. You can also discuss the treatment modalities with the present doctor. Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",
