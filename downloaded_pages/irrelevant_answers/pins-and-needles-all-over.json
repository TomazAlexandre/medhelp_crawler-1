    "question": "Hi, I'm a 14 year old male and I have been feeling pins and needles all over my body at random times, such as when I'm doing the dishes, watching television or reading a book. It's completely random, not sure if it's linked to my body heat. This started two days ago and I'm really worried as to what could be the issue, I exercised regularly playing basketball until two weeks ago when I sustained an injury and was unable to play. These past two weeks I've mostly sat on a couch or chair using a device or computer almost all day, with zero exercise. I'm only 14 and quite healthy, I very rarely fall ill and this has me worried. Should I play basketball now that my injury has healed or do I consult a doctor first and not do any sports? Please help me out I'm panicking here... It's mostly in my fingertips and hands, but sometimes it goes all over my torso and back and can become extremely painful like I'm getting pricked by a needle, or it can be mild like a normal bout of pins and needles one can get when one sits in a position too long.",
