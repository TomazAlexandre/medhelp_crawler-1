            "answer": "Dear Ainegeu,You have been through so much! That is great that you are working. That means that you are doing well. You have had good, aggressive therapy. Your cancer has been chemo sensitive. It is reasonable if your CA 125 is normal and your x-rays are normal to take a break from chemotherapy. It looks like you have been diagnosed with a recurrence once a year. That will probably continue.Other therapies to consider include oral antiestrogens such as tamoxifen and arimedex. Other chemotherapy agents to consider in the future include Doxil and rechallenging with agents that you have taken before. As an example , you could receive taxol again as a weekly regimen, or carboplatin as weekly agent. The doses are lower with weekly dosing and that may help with your counts.You have lost weight because of frequent bowel movements. You may not be completely absorbing your nutrients. You should have your stool checked for infection. It is very common to get diarrhea from the toxin of the Clostridium diffiicle bacteria.I would suggest a nutrition consultation to fully reassess what you r nutritional needs are. You may need a monthly B12 shot. You may need help to control the frequency of your bowel movements. Agents that have been used to help with frequent bowel movements include:-cholestryramine-metamucil-tincture of opium-lomotilbest wishes to you",

            "answer": "Dear Ain,I hope that you do not have any further recurrences. I do have patients who have not experienced a recurrence for many years after treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer. However, realistically, most women who have experienced a recurrence of their cancer will face it again. I like your plan to get as strong as possible and learn as much as you can about cancer. You must not stop living even though you have a risk of experiencing this cancer againtake care",
