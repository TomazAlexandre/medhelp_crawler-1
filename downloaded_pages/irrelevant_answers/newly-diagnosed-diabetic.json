            "answer": "I can not really tackle the questions on type 2 diabetes drugs as I am a type 1 but I can tackle some of the food issues.Easiest solution is that if you have medical insurance MOST plans will cover going to a Diabetes education class and they are usually taught by a certified nutricianist.\u00a0\u00a0This is the best way to get all of those questions answered.\u00a0\u00a0Short of that you have the right idea - read the labels !!!!\u00a0\u00a0Many people simply do not realize how many carbs they eat so you are not alone :)Also, the exercise will help burn the carbs - and help lose the weight too.\u00a0\u00a0Only real way to lose weight is to exercise and eat right.\u00a0\u00a0All the rest is hype.\u00a0\u00a0If you belong to a gym most can tell you how many calories you should take in for your metabolism to maintain your weight.\u00a0\u00a0As long as you take in that amount or less and exercise on top of that you will lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0It really is simple math in 99% of the cases unless you have a medical issue on top of it.Definately give up the BAGELS !!!!\u00a0\u00a0LOL",

            "answer": "Hi 888mom,I read your post with interest about getting motivated with the right mindset to live a healthier lifestyle.For me it happened when my doctor had to start me on a rx to lower my choleserol (already on rx for high blood pressure). I didn't need any more warning signs and made up my mind that I had to make healthy choices and fast. I slid by for alot of years carrying extra weight and not much exercise. I know if I didn't change my lifestyle I am a good candidate for stroke, heart attack, etc. and I am going to do everything I can to live a quality life.Today I am drinking more water, green tea, less caffeine & eating lean, white meats and more fruit and veggies (the more raw food we eat the better) and whether you get organic or not be sure to rinse all of them well. Organic foods are the best and don't forget to buy meats/poultry and milk without added growth hormones too.\u00a0\u00a0As for the carbs, remember there are good carbs (fruits, veggies) and bad carbs (chips, sweets, etc. and white rice, white pasta, white bread, etc.) If you buy whole wheat breads, bagels, pasta, brown rice etc. it is less carbs than regular products so that helps and they are better for you too. When you eat protein you don't get as hungry so I have been able to lower my intake of carbs and haven't noticed. I do not deprive myself and still enjoy some if I go out to dinner or if I really want something and just don't overdo.Also, walking is the best exercise we can do and it's fun. Did you know the American Heart Association recommends 10,000 steps a day? I know that sounds like a lot! I have been walking everyday and my son bought me a pedometer and suggested I put it on when I get up and wear it til bedtime and boy do those steps add up! You will be amazed!You and only you can make up your mind to do this. It is a huge committment and one of the most important ones you will ever make. I don't know if you believe in God but once I made up my mind I asked God to help me to have the willpower I need to do this because I can't do it alone (I have tried and tried). God is good and He is enabling me to do this!One thing that helps me is to keep my goals in easy reach. I need to lose about 50 pounds but that's frustrating to me. When I started I set my goal for 5 pounds and made a committment to make some healthy changes (not everything all at once). When I lost the first two I was overjoyed and now I have lost 10-12 pounds and am thrilled and encouraged and I feel good knowing I am doing this for me.Finally, you sound like you're a younger woman with so much life ahead of you. I wish you the best! Just start with \"baby steps\" and you can do it and the best part of all is you will feel so good about your decision.God bless!",

            "answer": "Wanted to mention one very important thing...Do not, I repeat, do not \"beat yourself up\" if you have something bad. Just go forward from there telling yourself you are human (progress, not perfection is my motto) and you'll find that you \"cheat\" less and less.",

    "question": "Just got diagnosed with Type II today, in addition to my other health issues.\u00a0\u00a0I'm insulin resistant (had gestational diabetes and found that out when I was pregnant).\u00a0\u00a0Funny thing is that I've been taking Lyrica for my fibromyalgia and find out that it was originally used for diabetic nerve pain.\u00a0\u00a0Ha ha ha.... well, at least I guess I don't have to worry about that since I'm on Lyrica already.\u00a0\u00a0LOL.So, what diets are good for diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0I've been tryign to go as all natural and close to organic as I can afford, and my doctor said South Beach diet really good.\u00a0\u00a0So I got the book from my motherinlaw today... and a recipe book.\u00a0\u00a0How do you stick to a low carb diet?\u00a0\u00a0When I was pregnant, I just kept thinking, only so many more weeks and then I won't have to worry about it.\u00a0\u00a0After I delivered, my blood sugar levels were normal and I passed the 3 hour glucose test and my 3 month blood levels several months for a followup visit were fine again.\u00a0\u00a0But, 2 years later, now have diabetes, and it's for life, not just for a few months.\u00a0\u00a0So, how do you get in the right mindset?\u00a0\u00a0How do you give up those carbs?\u00a0\u00a0And how do you lose the weight!?\u00a0\u00a0And what medicines are good?\u00a0\u00a0My doc started me on Metformin and wants me to check with my health insurance to see if they will cover Byeta (not sure of spelling on that).\u00a0\u00a0Are those good drugs?\u00a0\u00a0Do they help with weight issues?\u00a0\u00a0Or do they cause weight gain?\u00a0\u00a0My father did not do well on Byeta and he blames that medication for messing up his levels, and he says he had to stop Byeta and go on insulin and he had been fine before doing it.\u00a0\u00a0So, is Byeta bad?\u00a0\u00a0Or is it good?\u00a0\u00a0My father is insulin resistant as well, so I think it's a genetic thing.\u00a0\u00a0And what things do you buy to keep in your house!?\u00a0\u00a0Looking in my closet, reading all the labels, man do we have a high carb household!\u00a0\u00a0I nearly dropped dead when I saw the carb count on the bagel package.\u00a0\u00a0And to think I was having one of those suckers every morning for breakfast!",
