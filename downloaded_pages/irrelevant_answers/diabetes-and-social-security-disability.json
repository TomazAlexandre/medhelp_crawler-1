            "answer": "Dear PSAEMR,All of us are volunteers here, but I agree with bl. I have a different disability, but from the information that you gave it sounds like you may qualify for SSD. I am not a attorney but I did have one to help me through the process. I would look up the website www.ssa.gov/disability. This will be a start.I became disabled over 20 years ago. SSD normally takes three times meeting with a judge and doctors to determine if you qualify. I have to say that I am not sure how much the system\u00a0\u00a0has changed. I also had an attorney that specialized in disability cases which was helpful. He took a small fee out of my disability retroactive pay from the company that I worked for. You can go through the process without one.You may want to contact our Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation website for the ODST outreach program (online diabetes support team) which is a one on one contact. The website is www.jdrf.org.I hope this has been helpful and I would love to hear back from you to see how you are doing.My Best,dm",

I have a very sharp and fast changing blood sugar(1-32)\u00a0\u00a0and fast metabolism. Estonia is a small, fast-growing and a nice country to live and Estonia is my home country and I'm Estonian nationality.However, here is a very low incapacity pension ! Such incapacity pension, I can not handle my normal everyday life any way ! At the end of the month I do not have the money to buy food ! How do I pay taxes, buy clothes, shoes, visit the dentist, buy housing, considered a car (without which I can not cope), and so on. ? Estonia is a European Union Member country ! I do not work for five years. My incapacity pension is only 248 euros per month. Our country has an average salary of about 1000-1200 euros per month ! Depending on the severity of the job and the company, paid by the employer in 2400-6000 euros per month, but a low salary is only 600 euros per month. How is it possible that I diabetic 1 group (who are living a much greater needs than in healthy people) have to cope with 248 euro per month ......? 8(I do not have the capital ! My supportive parents and grandparents will also aging at time! The car needs repair, teeth repair, paying taxes, living the life, and so on. ! A healthy person, or some other mechanical fault a person can be deprived of food for about a week in an emergency, but one group of diabetic and high metabolism can die within 2 days away, and if the food does not get the worst case of brain damage and other permanent complications ! Thus, this disease has to be very careful with the economic downturn, and no capital for life! Group 1 diabetes must surely be necessary to ensure a disability pension for life! ! group of diabetic patients, especially in the case of a fast metabolism, are considerably higher demands of life as a healthy person ! Group 1 and group 2 diabetes can not be compared! ! group 1 diabetes with fast metabolism are at the most difficult form of the disease !",
