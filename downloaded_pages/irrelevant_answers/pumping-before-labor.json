            "answer": "I would ask your doc but I would think probably not a good idea.\u00a0\u00a0Your body will change the amount of milk produced by what your baby eats. Pumping before I think would get your body use to feeding that is not your babies schedule or needs.",

            "answer": "As far as I'm aware the milk your leaking now has no nutritional value to baby, it's mainly made of water.A very small amount of collostrum. The important stuff comes after you deliver the placenta. It triggers hormones in your body to release/make the collostrum milk with all the anti bodies in.It can also put you into Labour :)",

        {
            "answer": "I truly hope it's not water because I've been instructed by my doctor to extract breastmilk & stimulate my breasts to start breastmilk production and to give the little I manage to extract to my baby straight after birth..I've been told its VERY nutricious and healthy and will assist my baby to have normal bloodsugar.I have Gestational Diabetes and I think that's why I've gotten these instructions.Appearntly its not uncommon for moms with Gestational Diabetes to have a delay in breastmilk flow after birth, so anything you manage yo extract in advance is very very valuable for the baby.As we've all heard different things,if I were you -I would check with my doctor :)",
