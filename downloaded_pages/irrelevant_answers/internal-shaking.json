            "answer": "Hello Dear,Since how long you have been on lopressor.? It seems you have typical complaints of orthostatic hypotension.While getting up from bed, simply sit for a while before popping out of the bed.Gradually sit over the edge of the bed and then just stand off the bed.Make this a habit.Take some fresh juice, fluids early in the morning.The high anxiety could be responsible for your problem.Relax and meditate atleast for few minutes daily.BestTake care",

Those 2 are a biggie for internal tremors.\u00a0\u00a0Also, side effects from medication will do it.\u00a0\u00a0I love the MD who tells you to meditate. Oh, ok that is typical and not getting to the root of the cause.\u00a0\u00a0Call your PCP and have them check thyroid, glucose and check with Pharmacy regarding side effects from meds.Good luck",
