            "answer": "The first thing I thought of when I read that is Restless Leg Syndrome... though things are never as simple as they seem! You don't mention the uncontrollable urge to move your legs but the rest seems similiar.According to the RLS Foundation.. the four diagnostic criteria are*You have a strong urge to move your legs which you may not be able to resist. The need to move is often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations. Some words used to describe these sensations include: creeping, itching, pulling, creepy-crawly, tugging, or gnawing.*Your RLS symptoms start or become worse when you are resting. The longer you are resting, the greater the chance the symptoms will occur and the more severe they are likely to be.*Your RLS symptoms get better when you move your legs. The relief can be complete or only partial but generally starts very soon after starting an activity. Relief persists as long as the motor activity continues.*Your RLS symptoms are worse in the evening especially when you are lying down. Activities that bother you at night do not bother you during the day.",

            "answer": "Hi,How are you?It is quite possible that the cramps and tingling numbness are due to peripheral neuropathy. This can be due to diabetes or Vitamin B12 deficiency.Please get your blood sugar levels checked.Another cause for calf cramps and tingling numbness can be nerve compression. Compression of the sciatic nerve or one of its five nerve roots can cause pain in the calf along with tingling numbness.Please do some leg exercises, massage and heat and ice therapy will also help.",

    "question": "Hi there...last month for the first time ever, I awoke from my sleep due to pain associated with a calf cramp. It was terrible for about 2 minutes and then passed and I went back to sleep. The following month, it happened again. On both occasions, I had not exercised or anything that would have caused my calf to hurt like it did.Recently, the calf cramp happened again and when I was at my doctor for a different reason, I asked her if it was normal. She seemed to think so. Since then, my calves are constantly stiff, sore, cramping and throbbing....at any point during the day but especially when I am sitting or lying down. I also have burning, tingling sensations and numbness in my feet and toes.Anyone have a clue what this might be from or experienced the same thing?",
