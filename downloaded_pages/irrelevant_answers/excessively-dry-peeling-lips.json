            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!There is one very simple thing that I would like to tell you. Lip area when it heals, forms a scab like dry layer. This layer though looks bad should be left as such so that the skin underneath it can get time to grow and cover the lips. If you peel this dry skin, the healing process starts all over again with dry skin on your lip.Dehydration is the commonest cause of dry cracked lips. Drink plenty of water and see.The other possibility is iron and Vit B deficiency. Along with multivitamin B (not a multivitamin which also has other vitamins) take an iron preparation and see.They can also be caused by allergies and infections. You could either be suffering from contact dermatitis or from allergy to some food. You should get an allergy test done, either a skin test or RAST, to know what you are allergic to. Contact dermatitis could be due to tooth pastes, mouth cleansers, spoons, cups, glasses, food items, cosmetics, shampoos, etc, basically anything that comes in contact with your lips.Another possibility is eczema. Herpes infection is another possibility if there is a history of kissing or sexual contact (can get aggravated in presence of vitamin deficiencies, dry cracked lips, infections etc). Also get your blood sugar checked both fasting and two hour after food to know what if you have diabetes. Hypothyroidism too can cause this type of skin and lip problem. I would",

    "question": "A little over a month ago, I began having a problem with my lips, out of the clear bue.\u00a0\u00a0There had been a noticeable dry spot on my top lip that was like a \"patch\" of some sort, completely different from the skin on the rest of my lips, but it didn't really bother me, so I ignored it.\u00a0\u00a0So now...Both my top and bottom lips have started peeling to the point of being raw.\u00a0\u00a0Continuously.\u00a0\u00a0They are not even like \"lip\" skin tissue any longer.\u00a0\u00a0It is like NO moisture whatsoever is getting to my lips.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot even open my mouth without getting a painful open crack!\u00a0\u00a0Can't smile anymore, and have to be extremely careful when I eat.\u00a0\u00a0So, what I've tried... are natural lip balms with beeswax.\u00a0\u00a0I started taking a B Complex supplement 3 days ago, along with some other vitamins.\u00a0\u00a0So far, nothing has changed my situation.Even the skin above and below my lips is peeling, and is slightly discolored... all around my mouth.\u00a0\u00a0It does not itch.\u00a0\u00a0It only hurts, because it's raw.I am drinking lots of extra water, more than I normally do.\u00a0\u00a0I rarely wear lipsticks or makeup.\u00a0\u00a0I do not think this has to do with anything I am drinking or applying to my lips... I think it's something internal causing this.\u00a0\u00a0I've searched many posts regarding this, and I see others have this problem who have been to Drs with no luck.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have a job, OR health insurance, so I can't afford to go anyway...I am just wondering if anyone has any suggestions?My very latest thing was mixing some emu oil with a few essential oils.\u00a0\u00a0That seems to have helped the most, but I have to keep it with me at all times, and apply it literally \"continuously\" to achieve any relieve.\u00a0\u00a0Once it dissipates, my lips are incredibly painful...and when i purse my lips (the opposite of smiling), they just crumple up like dry crepe paper.What can I do?\u00a0\u00a0This is so embarrassing I can't even go out in public anymore!!!!\u00a0\u00a0Help!\u00a0\u00a0I have a history of allergies, but this doesn't seem like any type of allergic reaction?\u00a0\u00a0It's been going on WAY too long now.\u00a0\u00a0Tonight, as bad as I hate to, I'm going to try some vaseline.\u00a0\u00a0Normally, I'm an all natural person, but I'm at my wits end.This discussion is related to/posts/show/1298068.",
