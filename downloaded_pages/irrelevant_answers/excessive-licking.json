He gave her a shot and then the licking stopped. We never figured out what she was allergic to, but at least we alleviated the symptoms. I hope this helps. Cat\u00a0\u00a0=)",

            "answer": "the shot would have been cortisone, this takes care of the symptoms only and sometimes just temporarily...also steroids can lead to many health problems like diabetes...always best to find the cause and treat that rather than resorting to steroids. hopefully the problem won't return.read comments on this thread by clicking on the link below, its a long thread 137 posts starting in 2007!!!\u00a0\u00a0 I suggest scrolling down to the newest ones posted in 2012...best of luck\u2665http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Cats/Cat-licking-her-hair-off---allergies-or-stress/show/146",

    "question": "My 3 year old long hair domestic cat has been excessively licking most of his hair off, not completely bald but to where the hair remaining is extremely short. He has been doing this for several months now, as it started when I was finishing up a cheaper flea medication I got from a dollar store. He was fine with it for about 10 or 11 months but the very last dose that I gave him is when the licking began. He is now on advantage and the licking is still bad and he looks weird in his back end because he licks the underside of his tail by his bum, his hind legs both sides, both sides of his rib cage and of course the underside of him. He is still at 10 lbs. as he has not lost weight but due to the hair being the way it is, he looks like he did! He also throws up, as he always did his whole life like most cats do due to hair balls but I think its because he eats too quickly and too much at one sitting. I have since reduced the amount of food but feed him several times during the day, which include once before I head to bed. Any suggestions of might be wrong or what I could do! His poop seems fine, no worms or diarrhea! He was fixed about 2 years ago!",
