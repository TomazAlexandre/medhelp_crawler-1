            "answer": "Interesting question!I think we'll be able to cure MS once we understand the disease process.\u00a0\u00a0Right now we can see the effects of MS on the human body, but we have very little idea of why it decides to attack.The CCSVI theory (chronic cerebro-spinal venous insufficiency) is a new theory that's making the rounds.\u00a0\u00a0Basically it proposes that lesions are formed because blood backs up into the brain from blocked arteries.\u00a0\u00a0They've done some doppler scans of MS patients, and found that almost 100% of these patients have blocked arteries in the neck - pancaked, like they've been squished flat.\u00a0\u00a0Some people have had stents put in their neck, but they haven't seen an immediate improvement of their symptoms.",

            "answer": "I think most of the diseases that trace their origin within the body itself, will trace the cause to our genes. They might be autoimmune diseases like arthritis, MS or other abnormalities like cancer (uncontrolled growth).Finding how and why certain genes cause the diseases would probably the 1 step but once that is done the bigger task would be to find the cure (how do we correct a bad gene). It would even go to the extent of saying that finding root cause in genes and correcting them would be even bigger than what I consider the biggest discovery of all time - theory of relativity.A discovery or invention of such a mammoth proportion would be very difficult and might probably take decades. Add a few more decades due to our incompetent politicians who unfortunately call the shots in terms of where the money needs to go. Believe me, not many of them think finding cause of these diseases is not on their priority list.I am saying such a long time with lot of conviction since that would almost mean unraveling nature's most complex creation. Every few years, nature has been throwing new challenges at medical scientists. Case in point1) they started with conclusion that 95% of our genes are junk only to discover recently that these so called junk genes are the cause of some diseases. So they are not junk2) until recently, it was assumed that our DNA is the really hero who stores all the intelligent information and RNA only does the job of a plumber only to discover that RNA is really the intelligent part and it was even called as command and control of our system pushing DNA to the background.Before someone concludes that I am sadist, let me also tell that what I have mentioned is about the ultimate health. We will continue to see short term treatments for lot of diseases though they will never be real cures. For example, people with diabetes get treatment to contain and avoid damage it causes. The real cure for diabetes will probably come up only when we truly understand our system at the cell, DNA, RNA ... level ...My 2 cents ...",

Do you think it will be a curable illness in the next decade?I am not diagnosed - but have some suspect symptoms. I often read this forum - but rarely post!",
