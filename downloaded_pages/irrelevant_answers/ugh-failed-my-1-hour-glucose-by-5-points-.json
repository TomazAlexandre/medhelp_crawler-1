            "answer": "I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything at all before the one-hour test?Anyway...with my last two pregnancies I had to take the 3-hour. Passed both of them. Actually, with my last one, they tested me THREE TIMES because my son was so big they were SURE I had gestational diabetes. This time I failed the one-hour (like you, by five measly points), had to take the three hour. For the three hour to be positive, two of the four readings have to be high. Well, my two-hour reading was FIVE POINTS high, the rest were all normal. The doc is still putting me on a diabetic diet due to my high risk (my age and weight). Pain in the butt! And the kicker is, I'm 20 weeks and haven't gained one single pound. I guess that doesn't matter...oh well. :::sigh:::Good luck on your three-hour! Take a book or download a movie on your iPod...lol. They won't let you leave the lab during the three hours!Tricia",

            "answer": "Oh my! I know, 5 points isnt much at all! But I guess they have to be careful. They said I could eat a light breakfast, but I didnt know it was supposed to be like an hr before I drank the drink. I ate it like 5 min before I drank it :0\u00a0\u00a0Im praying thats why it was high. It really surprised me as with my last 6 preg. it was fine. Im wondering if its my age. Im 28 1/2 weeks and finally gained 6 lbs this past month. I hadnt been gaining but they told me not to worry the baby was growing fine. But I feel HUGE now!I measured 29 at 28 weeks. Guess thats not too bad :/\u00a0\u00a0Is the diet that bad?\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks for replying! I appreciate it lots :)",

            "answer": "The diet isn't horrible. It's not like a regular diet. It's just avoiding certain foods at certain times of the day, and keeping things balanced. For example, I can't have fruit or milk in the morning, because it makes your blood sugar spike. But I can have a peanut butter sandwich. I admit, I'm not following it closely, but I am being more careful.As an aside...have you noticed that they have lowered the thresholds for what is considered gestational diabetes? My dad mentioned the same thing about testing for Type II Diabetes. I honestly think that much of it is just another scam to get more money from our insurance companies. What was considered within normal range ten years ago is now considered positive result. In my case, my results weren't even \"positive\" but the MD said it was borderline and I was high risk, so he wants me to see the dietician. However, he isn't concerned enough to have me actually monitoring my sugar with a meter. Kind of odd. Makes me think sometimes that the nutritionist give the MD a kickback for referrals. LOL.",

Mne was 144 :(\u00a0\u00a0I did eat toast and butter right before I drank the glucose drink adn she said that may have affected it, but I do have to go do the 3 hour next Monday.
