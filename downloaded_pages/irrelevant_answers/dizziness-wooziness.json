            "answer": "Hi there. These areas could be white punctate lesions suggestive of demyelination. You need to correlate these with the clinical findings. If this was done since, there was a clinical suspicion of multiple sclerosis; these lesions have significance and may represent MS plaques. Diagnosis of MS is made based on clinical history of previous attacks, CSF examination, and MRI. Certain diagnostic criteria and radiological criteria need to be fulfilled. These while lesions represent micro vascular ischemic changes in the brain. So these changes are seen in people with micro vascular or macro vascular risk factors like history of hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol etc. these could also mean infectious or inflammatory conditions. Hope this helps. Take care.",
