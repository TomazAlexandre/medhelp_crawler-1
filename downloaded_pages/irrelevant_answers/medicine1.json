            "answer": "There is no way to answer that question from the information provided. You have all kinds of mish-mosh thrown about. Digoxin has been used for decades and when needed, is needed. I don't understand this \"can be very toxic\" business. Physicians these days follow fairly standard protocols throughout the United States. I don't see anything in your post that seems to be malpractice if that is your legal objective.",

    "question": "Hi.I was finding blood in my urine 2 months after and overdose of warfarin.The warfarin was being monitered and kept at 2.5 INR but somehow they doubledit and my INR rose to 18. They brought me down quickly in the hospital backto 2.5 INR, but I did not like seeing blood clots in my urine, after triplebipass surgery 5 months earlier. I was so tired I would fall asleep at the wheelor while working if I did not take caffiene pills. My cuts and sores wereinflaming and bleeding easily and my sight had doubled/blurry. I thought itwas the wrafarin and warfarin overdose. I was taken off warfarin at the hospitaland had the symptoms still 2 months later. Because there were many mistakeswith this physician and I felt I wasn't to blame I sought legal help.A new cardiologist took me off Digoxin which can be very toxic. Then I foundweb pages on the prescription drug. The symptoms of toxicity were matching.Now, my cuts,etc. were healing a little more, and my urine was dark brown but notbloody, and I did not fall asleep as easy without the sensation of doublevision.Among other things, I saw this physician 3 weeks after the blood thinner overdose.He gave me a clean bill of health. I would have been on Digoxin through him at least4 months longer and the refills would have lasted for amother year. I can't help butfeel the digoxin was poisoning.I read where you shouldn't be on it unless you haveto. Right after my triple bipass they told me it looked like I had diabetes andthey noticed an irregular heart beat that came back to normal before I left thehospital. I have never had a heart attack.Shouldn't I have been off this drug much sooner?",
