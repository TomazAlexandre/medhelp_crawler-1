            "answer": "I would watch the following foods that raise blood glucose levels:1. Fruit has fruit sugar [fructose]. Limit the amount and eat fruits with other foods to slow glucose entering into your blood stream. Test after \"each\" fruit. Avoid those that raise your levels.2. White rice is carbohydrates which turn into sugar after eating. Cut back on the amount eaten.3. Most yogurt has sugar as do dairy products. Cut back or avoid consumption.Don't eat white foods; white bread, white rice, white potatoes or foods made with these products. These turn into sugar after eating.Eat more if you want to gain weight. The amount you posted a bird would lose weight. In other words, put the spoon down and pick up a shovel.",
