            "answer": "Hypothyroidism disease slows down our metabolism and it does become difficult to lose weight. It is good that your MD did blood work on your thyroid hormone levels and is evaluating the proper medication (to regulate the thyroid). Research has indicated that the combination of thyroid medication, healthy eating and exercise will result in weight loss. An exercise program you are doing already which is great. Healthy eating habits include all the food groups, including high fiber Carbohydrates that are allowed due to your Celiac disease, with moderate portions. Try to eat a Heart Healthy diet which will give you the nutrients, vitamins and minerals your body needs, and help with your disease states. Heart Healthy diet which is a moderate fat diet and a moderate fat diet means = using polyunsaturated (omega 3, corn oil, nuts, etc) fats and monounsaturated (olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil, etc) fats, no saturated fats (high fat snack foods, butter, fat spreads) and no trans fats. Eat low fat meats (chicken, fish, loin of pork) or non-meat sources (soy products, nuts), low fat vegetarian combinations (rice & beans, rice pasta & beans, low fat cheese & rice pasta), low fat and substitute dairy products (1% milk, low fat/fat free yogurts, low fat soy milk/soy yogurt), use plant oils, non trans-fat margarines, and eat a lot of fruits and vegetables. Eat daily high fiber breads and cereals allowed under the Celiac diet.",
