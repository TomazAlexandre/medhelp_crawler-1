            "answer": "GD is not my forte but can comment on proper nutrition.Let's start with normal glucose levels.* Fasting and preprandial is 60/70 to 99 mg/dl* Postprandial [2-3 hrs after meal] <121 mg/dl, optimum is normal fasting levels* Bedtime should equal normal fasting levelsIf you have above normal glucose levels for periods of time your body is fooled into thinking it is normal. When your lower glucose level your body squawks a bit because its not used to being at this level. Ignore it and concentrate on obtaining and maintaining normal levels.Instead of 3 big meals eat smaller balanced meals 5 times or more throughout the day. You satisfy your hunger and diminish the cravings where the cravings will dissipate over time. There just bad habits that you must break away from. Exercise also helps to diminish cravings. Google 'simple vs complex carbs' so you'll know to stay away from simple carbs.You mentioned milk and white bread. Both are bad. Milk contains a type of sugar called lactose which will raise your blood glucose. Even lactose free milk contains sugar. Milk contains a minimum of 8 grams of carb sugar per serving. That's equivalent to a little over a heaping Tablespoon of refined sugar...nasty. Look around for Hemp milk which has zero calories, zero cholesterol, zero sugars, low in fat and sodium and high in Omega 3 & 6, high in calcium, high in Vit B12 & D, and high in\u00a0\u00a0magnesium & other minerals.Eat more vegies, more fruit, lean meats and fish and poultry. Avoid foods made with white flour; white breads, pasta, white rice and potatoes as they quickly turn into sugar after eating. Look for whole wheat bread, not the enriched or fortified junk, but breads made from whole grains. My artisan bakery makes a nine seed whole wheat sourdough bread that is to die for. Look for whole wheat pasta or, if you can find, Dreamfield's pasta which is low on the Glycemic Index and low to no sugar after digestion.The foods are there, just have to look for them. Might have to switch from big box grocery stores to local or natural organic foods stores to find unadulterated foods that are good for you and baby. HTH",

            "answer": "Most of your questions were answered :)Why do you feel you should have that much milk?Neither you, nor the baby need that much!!!Did the doctor tell you to drink that amount?I had gestational diabetes also. I only had one preg./1 child.He was small which is unusual for gest. diabetes.Yes, I have type 2 now. There is an increased but not definite possibility that you willalso have it later.\u00a0\u00a0Try to keep your weight down ( a common cause of type 2, but some are not overweight)\u00a0\u00a0I hope you are testing quite a few times a day.There are low carb breads ( that are actually good!) and tons of food that are very healthy and more then edible now!!!Dreamfields\u00a0\u00a0pasta is great. Walmart has their own version of it.If you have to have rice , (on of my weaknesses) eat brown.\u00a0\u00a0It is less likely to raise your blood sugars as much.\u00a0\u00a0I have even found low carb icecream and it is fantastic!\u00a0\u00a0I have trouble with stress/emotional eating. Do they test you for a while after you have your babies?\u00a0\u00a0They didn't with me and in 4 years (age 35) later I was diagnosed with diabetes. I am overweight and it is a constant struggle for me.\u00a0\u00a0sounds like you may not be on a strict diet? I am very sensitive to\u00a0\u00a0foods some diabetics aren't usually, and visa/versa. I would also ask your doctor to refer you to a endocronagest sp? or diabetic educator.\u00a0\u00a0There are many foods that have calcium in it other then dairy products.\u00a0\u00a0 You will be surprised at what they make now!!! Lots of good tasting healthy food!Robin",

            "answer": "Sorry I forgot something.If you need insulin please take it, unless you can control your diet to a T.Pills don't work or can be harmful to the baby during pg.Carbs will raise your b.s. but what is considered low to you?I was fortunate I didn't have to go on insulin then. I was more careful I think.It is almost like I only cared because of the baby. Your health and the babies is just as important, gaining a few lbs. may be needed. I lost weight during my pregnancy. I think it was the first time in my life I didn't eat everything in sight. My son was 5lbs 4oz.\u00a0\u00a0He was a few weeks early, they had no idea why he was so small, (37 weeks gest.) Not a preemie but close. Best of luck to you! Congratulations.",

            "answer": "HI I also was just diagnosed with GD... I am just wondering if I can choose to take insulin or choose to do the diet, does the doctor choose for you? or does it depend on your levels. I am very worried, as I know as hard as I try I will not be able to stick to the diet. I have given up smoking and drinking for my baby, I don't know if I have the strength.",

            "answer": "You need to do what the doctor says. You didn't list any numbers for your\u00a0\u00a0blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0You gave up smoking and drinking just for your baby? So you drank before you knew you were pregnant? I hope not.\u00a0\u00a0If so be honest with your health team.You may need insulin, but you still HAVE to eat very healthy, and with a food plan that will help you keep on track.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't care for your baby before it is born many things can happen. I would look up a search like \"What happens what a person with GD doesn't take care of themselves?\" Or something similar to that.\u00a0\u00a0You seem awful worried about how it will effect you. What about your baby? It may be huge which is common. I am talking often well over 9lbs. I was across the hall from a woman with GD when I had my son.\u00a0\u00a0Her son was born by c-section and weighed almost 15lbs. That is unusual I believe but it can happen!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you don't care for yourself (including your baby) your baby could have permanent\u00a0\u00a0problems. The strength?\u00a0\u00a0You had the strength to get pregnant didn't you?Sorry if I sounded sarcastic. Please try to do what you are told to do k?\u00a0\u00a0 I didn't have to take insulin, but it was close a few times.\u00a0\u00a0I am on it most of the time now. I know it's hard but there are a lot of good things you can eat. You can eat small amounts of sweet things, on occasion.\u00a0\u00a0It isn't the only food that you have to control.\u00a0\u00a0There is a sugar even in fruit. Strawberries have some of the lowest sugars in fruits. I would keep the junk out of the house. I hope all goes well for you and your baby :)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's not that bad, I have had diabetes for over 10 years now, type 2.\u00a0\u00a0Yes it can be a pain at times.\u00a0\u00a0I have learned a lot. I would join a chat group online or two of them, for G.D.\u00a0\u00a0You will learn a lot!\u00a0\u00a0But in the end please listen to your doctor(s).((((((((((((((((((((RmberMe69))))))))))))))))\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hang in there, it will be okay.Robin",

            "answer": "I do eat pretty healthy already, I have veggies all but 2 nights a week. I don't have coffee, I have 1 tea a day. I eat chocolate prob once a month. I gave up smoking and drinking when I found out I was pregnant ( I thought I couldnt' have any more babies so this was a surprise)t, I have 4 healthy kids and never smoked or drank with them. I am 42 year old with high blood pressure, and was told that GD and high blood go hand in hand.I don't have any numbers, as I was only called the other day to advise that I had GD and couldn't see anyone till this Tuesday coming up. When I wrote this question on Med Help I was actually in shock and wanted advice.I am pretty hurt that you could say I don't care for this baby, it couldn't be further from the truth. My main concern about being unable to to stick to the diet is my baby and how GD will affect it. I would never ignore what my doctors say, I am taking my meds for blood pressure, if I didn't care I wouldn't take those meds. I have been so ill with the blood pressure on its own.I have never been associated with anyone who has Diabetes so I have no real clue at what\u00a0\u00a0to expect.Thanks for your support.",

            "answer": "Hi, I am very sorry that I came across to you the way you thought I did.See, the way you presented things (I also only know you from that post) it did sound like you didn't care that much.\u00a0\u00a0If you read it, and made believe that it was someone else, you may understand how I got these ideas. You sounded like a teen who , whoops forgot her birth control.\u00a0\u00a0It felt and looked like you were imposed upon . Now that you explained things further my assumptions , and some of the things you said were taken wrong by me. When you said you already gave up smoking and drinking for this baby,\u00a0\u00a0Now if the post you just wrote was the original one, I wouldn't have responded like I did.\u00a0\u00a0NOW I understand where your coming from!\u00a0\u00a0I would be very upset as you are.You said\u00a0\u00a0something like you couldn't or wouldn't be able to stick to an eating plan. You will be surprised at what you can eat!\u00a0\u00a0I can eat chocolate but in moderation, and it can't be large amounts at one time. I am sure you know this. I would insist (they didn't with me) that you have a monitor to test yourself.\u00a0\u00a0My son is 18 now and the Endochronoligist (LOL @spelling) had me come in several days a week to get tested.Had your period stopped? I wonder if that is why you thought you couldn't get pregnant.I am almost 50 and hadn't had one in 4 years.\u00a0\u00a0Last Sunday I got it. I still have it and it is BAD. I have to get into see my gyno. asap. I think something is wrong.Wow 4 kids!! Congrats!!\u00a0\u00a0I was lucky I didn't have high blood pressure. I am overweight so i am fortunate. Tea is great, have you tried the ones without caffeine in them?\u00a0\u00a0I know I drank some Tea when I was pg. My doctor was fine with it. I just couldn't put honey in it :O(If you can't keep your numbers stable by your food plan and they are over a certain number you will have to go on insulin.\u00a0\u00a0You know your numbers may not be that high. I think I jumped the gun. We may have both done so. I don't want to tell you what could happen because it would be impossible to predict w/o you seeing the doctor tues. If your numbers go up say 20 points above where they want them to be, and it goes down quickly it is normal. I think you will be fine.\u00a0\u00a0I wasn't hungry during my pg. until the end.\u00a0\u00a0I got very hungry and my readings were in the 150's a few times.\u00a0\u00a0That isn't\u00a0\u00a0awful an hour after a meal. I was told almost nothing back then, and just tried to do what they say.My son had low bloodsugar when he was born (not uncommon with G.D.)I forgot if you said when you were due? I found out I think at around 4 month's along.Is that you in the picture? with that beautiful young lady? You look so healthy!!! and young too!\u00a0\u00a0I know other then myself many people who had gd.\u00a0\u00a0Also many that have diabetes type2.\u00a0\u00a0 First of all write down a bunch of questions you want to ask tues.Don't panic please. You probably will sail through w/o complications.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know anyone whose baby was permanently harmed from g.d .\u00a0\u00a0Yes they can get ill , but I don't think your doctor(s) will just say (eat no sugar and you will be fine)\u00a0\u00a0You will get a food plan. You have to watch carbs., sugars, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Keep asking questions.We got off to a bad start.\u00a0\u00a0How about if you'd like, we start over?If your numbers were REALLY high when you were tested I think they would have you seen by somebody before Tuesday. I think it will be okay. Wonderful to meet you ;) , my name is Robin",

            "answer": "Hi again, yes I think we got off on the wrong foot, and as I read my post again, I can see why it would have irked you. It did sound like it was all about me, I guess I could have worded it differently.The reason why I thought I couldn't have kids is I had an IUD in for many years and had it taken out\u00a0\u00a0last year. I fell pregnant a month after but I lost it at 6 weeks (blighted ovum) it nearly distroyed me. We tried for some time to fall preg but wasn't happening.( I forgot to mention that the reason I had the IUD in was the crazy periods I was having, and at the time I was anemic.) So I thought there was something wrong with me, I was considering an ablation and tubes done at the end of the year (I was seriously considering partial hysterectomy) I know it sounds like I am contradicting myself saying I thought I couldn't get pregnant and wanting to get these procedures done, its a confusing time.I am due on the 20th Nov so I am 15w and 6 days, well into my 16th week. The thing I found weird is that I have never been tested for GD in any of my other pregnancies, I know if I did I would have remembered the glucose drink (nasty stuff) I have a real sneaky suspicion that I had GD with my last baby, who was born in 2001.I was looking at an example of a meal plan for GD and I was thinking wow thats a lot of food to eat! Thats why I was worried about being able to stick to the plan, all that food looks daunting to me ( might bust lol). The main reason I am overweight is I don't exercise enough, I have always been a big girl and have spates of losing weight and being real good then the weight just comes back! I was very skinny before I started having children, I had my first at 19. I guess I am using the excuse that my kids put the weight on me, I know thats a definite cop out!That isn't me in the pic (I wish lol) That is my third eldest child with my youngest, my pride, joy and frustration! My other two who are 22 and 21 have left home one is a bakery manager (boy) and the other is part owner in a podiatry clinic (girl) I barely see them, it has been 6 years since I have seen my son and around 2 years for my daughter, they both live in different Aussie states.Yes lets start over, take care...\u00a0\u00a0I'm Vicki :-)",

            "answer": "I am trying to figure out for myself how many carbs I can eat without having to take insulin. If I know I am eating a super low carb meal I dont take my insulin. I have been eating scrambled eggs with gravy for breakfast and my glucose is 105-110 an hour after. For lunch I ate roast beef and greens and it was 111 an hour after. These numbers are without insulin.\u00a0\u00a0One thing I was wondering is if I stick to the recommended 30 carbs for breakfast, am I still supposed to take the insulin? I am thinking 30 carbs is too much for my body because when I ate scrambled eggs and added a piece of 9.5 carb bread with 1tbsp of peanut butter (4 carbs) and a very small amount of jam ( lets go high and say 10 carbs) my glucose was 155 1.5 hours after. So are they saying WITH the insulin I can have the 30 carb breakfast, 45 carb lunch and dinner?\u00a0\u00a0So pretty much if I want to maintain by diet only it will have to be with very little carbs and not what the diet plan says?\u00a0\u00a0Also, I have yet to be able to get an am fasting number below 100 without taking my night time dose. Is this impossible to do when you have diabetes even when eating a low carb diet?Thanks for all the input everyone! I want to learn how to control this thing in the event that I end up with Type 2. :)",

    "question": "I have had gestational diabetes now with 3 pregnancies including this one. The last 2 pregnancies it came on very early and this time I could tell I had it around 8 weeks and was put on insulin at about 10 weeks. I fear I probably have or will end up with Type 2 Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 I am trying to control it better with my eating habits but am sad that I have to lower the amount of fat free milk that I drink. So I thought I would ask here and maybe someone could tell me in more detail about how this works.\u00a0\u00a0If I eat breakfast and my 1 hour glucose is, say 130 or 140, how soon could I have another 1 cup serving of milk? Could I have 1 cup every 2 hours? I notice when I am on the Insulin that it makes me eat more because I start to get shaky and sweaty before I am even hungry. I dont want to gain a bunch of weight so I would rather just not take Insulin and eat more protein. I also notice when I try to eat mostly protein or low carb veggies that I seem to CRAVE something starchy like bread!!\u00a0\u00a0Is there some kind of guideline to go by with the glucose readings for when you can eat something with carbs? If my glucose is below 100 how many carbs could I eat without it making me sleepy and lethargic?\u00a0\u00a0I really need more advice than what the nutritionist gave me which is telling me to eat 30 for breakfast/45 for lunch and dinner and 15 for a snack between breakfast/lunch and lunch/dinner. I need some IDEAS about what I can eat! :(",
