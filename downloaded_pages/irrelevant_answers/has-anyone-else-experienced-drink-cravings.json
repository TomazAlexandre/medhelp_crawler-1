This time I was lucky and didn't get gd, but still crave that soda. An occasional one is ok, but to help when I really shouldn't have one I would get a carbonated flavored water. It helped give that feeling of drinking a soda without the same stuff.",

I try to limit myself to 1-2 a week and try to stick to root beer and sprite! A little caffeine won't hurt the baby at all so don't worry too much about it. (:",
