    "question": "I am 21 years old and I am an athlete. I have been suffering from headaches since I was in the ninth grade in high school. There was a time in a basketball game where I fell out of the air, head first, onto the court and then there was this other time that I went up for a shot in a game and was knocked out of the air, again, head first. I wasn't unconscious but it did hurt for a few days. Every since then I have been having headaches. I'm not sure if that really had an effect on me though. Up until this day,after any sport or activity, I get painful, painful headaches. I wake up every morning with headaches. I even had one this morning. Sometimes they last all day and sometimes just half the day. I event forget what I am talking about sometimes. There are a few other things that I have noticed over the years but I know I don't have time to discuss everything. I don't think that Migraines or anything run in my family. I know that diabetes and cancer does. I also have a trait of sickle cell. I know that it's not that serious but I just thought that I would inform you of that just in case that plays a part in it. Also, I have weighed only 107 pounds or less for the past4 or 5 years. I have difficulty gaining weight. I have been trying to get to the doctor to do some x-rays on my head for a while now but I can't really afford it. I hope and pray that someone with experience will receive this and is able to help me and advise me on what should be done. I worry everyday if I am going to wake up the next day b/c I don't know how serious this is.I will appreciate any help. Thanks",
