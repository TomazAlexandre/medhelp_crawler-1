            "answer": "Changing lifestyle habits can go a long way in controlling type 2 diabetes. Restrict and avoid refined sugars and bad carbs, weight control, exercise, stress management, and even adequate sleep are all important in managing this illness, the most important, besides proper nutrition, is physical activity.The A1c level of 8.3% is very high. Continuing on this path can and will lead to other serious health complications. Drugs, oral and/or insulin, will help lower glucose levels \"temporarily\", the goal being to control one's lifestyle in order help to manage glucose levels and not depend solely on drugs as the cure.",
