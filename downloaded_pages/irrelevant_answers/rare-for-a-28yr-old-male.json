            "answer": "Not sure of the spelling but look up urethritis. It is usually caused by an sti, but not always. Antiobiotics would help it temporary, but usually you need a long course of treatment. Also look at narrowing of the urethra (urethra strictures). Other then that stones can cause symptoms of UTI. Hope this helps and I know it can be fraustrating when you don't know what is and scary as well",

            "answer": "Hello,I know that suffering from recurrent UTI\u2019s is really very painful. In males, as you know UTI\u2019s are quite rare but unfortunately once the males get the UTI\u2019s, they become difficult to treat. Important things to be ruled out for recurrent UTI\u2019s in a male are :-1.\tDiabetes2.\tAny urinary obstruction commonly due to stones/strictures3.\tAny congenital abnormality in the urinary tract4.\tChronic prostatitisHe should definitely see a urologist and will need further tests to rule out these possibilities. For e.g. an USG of the kidneys,ureters and bladder, IVU etc.I sincerely hope that helps. Please do keep me posted. Warm regards.",

    "question": "My husband is 28 yrs old and hasn't been able to get adequate medical attention as he's been sent around on different deployments to the Middle East and Asia over the past year. We are finally going to be able to get him into a Urologist, but the military can't see him for another 3 weeks. I want to be well informed because I don't trust they have been doing all they can to diagnose him properly. My husband has been diagnosed with 4 urinary tract infections over the past year. 1st one in June 08, 2nd one in Dec 08, 3rd one in Feb 09 and 4th one in May 09. His symptoms are: slight burning sensation when peeing, involuntary discharge or pee dribble into his underwear throughout the day - cloudy in color, occasional groin soreness and lower back soreness. Each time he was diagnosed with UTI they gave him anti-biotics that seemed to temporarily clear up the symptoms until the UTI would return a few months later. We took him to the ER in May and his Gonnorhea/Clamydia tests came back negative. His Prostate test checked out to be fine. Next step: seeing a Urologist. We just moved abroad again and that's why it's taking so long. What are the potential causes of this so we can be sure to check off all possibilities with our doctor? Process of elimination is helpful, but we'd like to know what this could be. 4 UTIs for a 28 yr old male is RARE and misdiagnosed. Any information you have would be most helpful. Thank you!",
