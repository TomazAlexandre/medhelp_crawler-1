            "answer": "Yes, these are all symptoms of type I diabetes in children. My child was wetting the bed, extremely thirsty all the time and was vomiting; his vomiting, we think, was contributed to a stomach virus he had at the time. We took him to the ER due to dehydration -they did a blood chemistry and his blood sugar was 399-they immediately admitted him to ICU and he was put on IV insulin. He's been a diabetic now for 3 years-he's now 9. He's has handled it amazingly well! In my opinion, I would definetly have the pediatrician run some further test on him to see if this could be the factor with your child. Hopefully not, but understand-technology has come a long way and diabetics can live long healthy lives if they'll get up off the couch, exercise and eat right!!!",

    "question": "I have a concern that my child may have diabetes. I have been doing research on symptoms etc. to see if he fits the criteria.My question is, Do children normally present the symptoms on a daily basis or can it show up with a matter of 2 or 3 days in between episodes? These with him are bed wetting,extreme hunger ,episodes of weakness and severe vomiting with no explained reason. The vomiting only occurs every few days but the other symptoms are daily. He dispalys a few other symptoms but these are the most extreme.",
