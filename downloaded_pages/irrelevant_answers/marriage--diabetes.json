            "answer": "Agreed. As long as her diabetes is under control and she is under the care of a physician there should be no problem having babies. Type 1 diabetes has been linked to genetics but it is far less of a percentage then say Type 2.Even if a person has the genetic susceptibility for type 1 diabetes the disease will not occur without a trigger.The number also goes down if the diabetic parent is the mother. Children of diabetic fathers have a higher risk of inheriting the disease.All in all, I've never met a type 1 diabetic who had a type 1 diabetic parent. It's pretty rare.",
