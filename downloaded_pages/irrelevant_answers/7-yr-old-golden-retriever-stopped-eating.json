            "answer": "Hello & welcome to the forum......Excessive amount of water drinking is my first concern here....This is an early indication of \"Somethings Not Right\"!Diabetes, Kidney Disease, Liver Disease, Cushings Disease are a few diseases that one symptom is excessive water intake....This alone, should get her a Vet check....If she hasn't had a Blood Panel done in the last year, she needs one.....The earlier these diseases are caught, the easier they are to treat.....Next, The fact she can't keep anything down is also a concern. Blockage comes to mind and can be fatal if left untreated......If she's eating ALOT of lizards, maybe they are toxic & this is causing the problem....Either way, because of all the symptoms you describe, she needs to be evaluated by her Vet....I personally, would not wait long to get her in.....IMO, she needs to be seen ASAP...Please, make the call & be sure and come back here to let us know how she's doing.....I hope she feels better, soon.......Karla",

    "question": "My 7 yr old female golden has always eaten dry food, she has just stopped eating. She is vomiting up her water I believe because she is drinking an excessive amount at one time. Has diarrhea mixed with stool, no blood in stool or vomit. I have started to limit her water so that she can only drink a cup at a time and she seems to keep MOST of it down (she still seems to \"burp\" for lack of a better word a bit on the ground). Her belly does not appear bloated but is firm. She is famous for eating toilet paper and lizards. Also I have started giving her small amounts of wet food which she eats and keeps down MOST of the time. She will also eat plain toast. She does seem a bit uncomfortable at times but also still runs around hunting lizards. I am perplexed.",
