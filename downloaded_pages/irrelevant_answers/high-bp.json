            "answer": "A diagnosis of hypertension is often made by 2 separate blood pressure readings that are high separated in time. A blood pressure of 160/100 falls in the category of Stage 2 hypertension which is often treated with medications in addition to lifestyle modification of diet and cardiovascular exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Having high blood pressure puts you at risk for further cardiovascular complications such as coronary disease and renovascular disease. You should speak with your regular doctor for a routine history and physical and for further evaluation for treatment options. Additionally, given your young age, other causes for hypertension should be ruled out (thyroid disease, etc).Your increased urination should also be addressed at your physician encounter as it might signal another metabolic disturbance such as diabetes.",
