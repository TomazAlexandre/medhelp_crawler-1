            "answer": "The reason why it is so difficult for an addict to taper is because it requires discipline, if the addict had the discipline they wouldnt find themselves jammed up in addiction.........addicts do drugs and in most cases they binge..........so to ask if an addict can have the discipline is 30/70 against but there still is that 30% success....",

            "answer": "The main reason most people do not want to taper is fear .the fear of the unknown.the fear of not being successful.but the main reason is they really do not want to because methadone works.it is the best thing that has happened to the addict.the reason they even consider getting off is how people look at someone that takes methadone.I say if your happy and the only issue is a few hours a month at the clinic assuming you have take homes then why stop who cares what people think **** them.most people are on some kind of drug.I truly believe addiction is a brain disease and methadone is the cure.just like a fat *** diabetic needs insulin.but society is the problem not methadone so if you have a job and pay your taxes and take care of your family to hell with society",

    "question": "I have been going through all the posts regarding methadone tapers in the hope of finding some tips to help with my own struggle and one repeated theme seems to crop up over and over again. Everyone seems to be able to complete the first stages of their taper with relative ease but people keep getting stuck at the end. What strikes me is that if a person is on say 60mg and drops say 2mg per week this is a drop of only 3.3%. A common theme seems to be that when people get down to about 10mg the reductions become too painfull. If you think about it this is not supprising as a 2mg reduction represents a 20% drop. which is very high. It would make more sense to drop by the smallest increment possible, even if this was only 0.5 or even 0.25mg per week. Obviously this would mean that it would take far longer to get totally off but the process would be far less painfull. I think it is probably just human nature that when you have done such good work to get down to such a low amount, you just want to be off completely. Personaly, I just wish I could get my own reductuon off the ground. If I have any advice at all for people thinking about going on methadone as a means to taper off other opiates it would be one word....... DON'T. Unless you do it over a very short period (i.e. under 3 weeks) it is just too hard to get off. You are literally going out of the frying pan and into the nuclear powered blast furnace.God bless,Graeme.",
