            "answer": "Hey Kev,First off, I am not a doctor but I totally understand your frustration.\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother was on so many meds before her death that it was ridiculous..... My mother had a hard time keeping everything straight, and although my grandma still had it all together mentally, they had her drugged up enough that she really didn't give a damn about anything.\u00a0\u00a0(That sux!)What I'd suggest you do in regards to your issues is, talk with a primary care physician. (Perhaps not the one who couldn't remember if he took out your bro's gallbladder.)\u00a0\u00a0Tell him/her about your stress and anger (both are valid and understandable) and perhaps they can put you in touch with a mental health professional that can help you weed things out.\u00a0\u00a0(Maybe a psychiatrist or another type of therapist)I had a issues that I tried to handle for years on my own, and it was a mistake.\u00a0\u00a0After growing a pair and going to talk with a therapist, I am a completely different man.\u00a0\u00a0(I take one med for my head, get plenty of exercise, eat right, drink plenty of water, etc.)Hope this helps Kev.\u00a0\u00a0Take care.",

            "answer": "I appreciate your advise but i'm just venting. this is how i tell other people about my experiences and i'm sure a few doctors read it, even though they could probably care less it makes me feel better to be able to express how i feel about the medical society now days. So its kind of like my own little theropy.LOL",

    "question": "My mother died last year from stage 4 breast Cancer. she had it before and it was stage2 about 15years ago. she had a routine check up constently. she went in with some pains in her hip, problems breathing, and she was having problems with her throat. they gave her all kinds of diagnoses until she went to a bone doctor and he put some dye in her back and found the cause which was stage four cancer. she died 5 mths later at 67yrs old. before that she had been diagnosed with diabetes, fybromyalgia, sjogrene syndrome, high blood preasure, conjestive heart failure,osteoperosis,tonsillitous, Gerd, hytial hernia, Anxiety(which is certainly understandable)and anything else you could possibly imagine. she took around fourty damn pills a day for about 25 yrs including pain meds. My father was diagnosed with diabetes, parkinsons, demensia, Gerd, depression and a couple of others that i cant possibly keep up with because its ridiculous. anyways, without the doctors consint i removed some of my fathers meds like the parkinsons and demensia and a few others that wernt related to his heart or vital organs and he is like a brand new man. Well isn't that something? to bad its illegal to go and slap the snot out of the doctors head. my down syndrome brother went in for surgery to have his gallbladder removed. guess what? he didn't have one. they removed it 22yrs ago but my mother was dieing and could not remember and at that time my father was too druged up to know his own name. you would think that sinse it was the same doctor who removed it 22yrs ago that he would have my brothers file sitting in front of him. nope!\u00a0\u00a0So in saying all that, i guess you could say i have an anger problem because there is nothing legally, that i can do to make it right sense any law suit on a doctor goes in front of a panel of doctors tosay if it is worthy of a law suit. How ironic is that?Ok, doc. what kind of meds do you think i need for my little problem!!!!",
