            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Since MRI and Ct scans of brain are normal, maybe you should look at getting MRI of upper cervical vertebrae done. This along with nerve conduction studies may help. It can also be Vit B12 deficiecy or deficiency of Vit D3 and not related to injury. Diabetes and hypothyroidism too should be looked at.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
