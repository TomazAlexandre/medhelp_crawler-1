            "answer": "Hi ozarkskye,my advice is based on my own experience, as I'm not a physician but have been a diabetic for 11 years.There are many diet plans for diabetics, but the ones that work best are usually custom-made for individuals, tailored to their specific needs by their nutritionist/dietitian. Was the diet plan your doctor gave you created with your input and have you discussed your concerns with him? I think it's very important to be able to communicate with our health providers, although I know very well that sometimes it's difficult. However, I would encourage you to talk to your doctor about the diet plan he gave you and see if it can be adjusted to meet your needs.That said, there are also different sources for diabetic diet plans which you can check out. One is the American Diabetes Association's website (www.diabetes.org), which has plenty of nutritional information, including diet plans and recipes.Here is what they say on their website regarding diet plans for diabetics:\" diabetes meal plan is a guide that tells you how much and what kinds of food you can choose to eat at meals and snack times. A good meal plan should fit in with our schedule and eating habits\"They also provide information on books and other resources about the subject, such as \"Diabetes meal planning made easy\" by Hope Warshaw.The Mayo Clinic also offers some helpful suggestions on creating a healthy eating plan for diabetics. More information on their website: http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/diabetes-diet/DA00027Good luck and take care of yourself!",

            "answer": "Okay, we're now about 5 days into learning that our daughter is diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0So really any info at this time is going to be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Some of our most immediate concerns revolve around diet.\u00a0\u00a0We fully understand how to do the calculations we need, how to check labels, really most of the basics.\u00a0\u00a0But we are also trying to find resources that are a little more specific as to snacks that are no-carb, low-carb.\u00a0\u00a0She's 6, almost 7, so going through some of that natural growing phase, seems hungry all the time.And I guess we are still in this \"honeymoon\" period, so I know not to expect consistent BG levels quite yet.\u00a0\u00a0But maybe some of the snacks and foods that are more diabetic-geared will help us not freak out if we see a higher BG.\u00a0\u00a0I have found many different groups/websites where I can buy their products, and is this something we should consider?\u00a0\u00a0But any kind of site where we could go and see a list of foods/snacks would certainly give us a better feel for this starting period (as if there really is such a thing for this disease).\u00a0\u00a0Never have quite been thrown into a situation like this where everything has to change so drastically, literally in the matter of the-morning-was-great to your-life-has-forever-changed.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry this is long, but I'm sure not for the last time.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks to all for words of wisdom.",

            "answer": "Hi Newtoit,I'm a volunteer here and I've had Type 1 diabetes for over 11 years.It must be a difficult and a bit confusing time for your family right now, dealing with your newly diagnosed diabetic child, but it's wonderful that in such a short time you have managed to gather a lot of vital information. Having diabetes or caring for someone who has it is an ongoing learning process. Just keep that in mind whenever you feel frustrated, because we all go through it.As for the no-carb, low-carb snacks you're asking about:The American Diabetes Association is a wonderful resource. They have specific information for children and parents on all types of diabetes-related issues, in addition to food and snack info: http://www.diabetes.org/for-parents-and-kids/pods.jspThe low carber forum has ideas and recipes for low-carb snacking: http://forum.lowcarber.org/archive/index.php/f-40.htmlBasically, if you'd like to give your child a low-carb snack you don't necessarily need to buy special products: snacks such as string cheese, hot dogs (without the bun), sugar free jello, low carb light yogurt (light n' lively has only 10 grams per serving), etc.\u00a0\u00a0are a good place to start. There are also plenty of low-carb cookbooks which feature simple, easy to make snacks. Check out the above websites though for more information.Good luck and take care!",
