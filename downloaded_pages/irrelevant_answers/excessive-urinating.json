    "question": "My son has an 8 month old American Eskimo puppy that he has had since she was 9 weeks old. She was drinking a lot of water and urinating excessively even for such a small puppy. We are a dog family and have shown in obedience, conformation and 4H so we have owned and housebroken many dogs so we have a good understanding of normal habits and housebreaking. He took her to his vet and they have ran all the tests including ultra sounds on her bladder and kidneys, blood work has been done and all test have come back negative. She isn't diabetic or have a shunt or kidney disease. She is healthy and happy but urinates as much as a 9 week old at 8 months old. She fully urinates even if she was just out and urinated 5 mintutes before. She can hold it in her crate for several hours but doesn't when she is in the house. I just got back from staying with him for a few days and spent some time observing and working with her and I don't believe it is behavioral.\u00a0\u00a0I let her out every 5-10 minutes she goes every time. She also submissive wets and urinates when she jumps up or without even squating. He is at his wits end with all the urinating. She is a puppy mill puppy that he bought on an impulse at a pet store, if that helps. She is a delight and very smart and we would like to get to the bottom of this. Any suggestions?",
