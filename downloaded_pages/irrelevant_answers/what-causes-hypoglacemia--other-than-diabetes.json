            "answer": "I am not a physician, but a volunteer and the mom of a type 1 and the daughter of a type 2 diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest that if the doctor cannot figure it out how to control these low blood sugars ; get a second or third opinion.\u00a0\u00a0It seems that you were told that it is a result of the bypass. The reason you feel better after eating carbs is that they are bringing up your blood sugar. That is how you treat a low blood sugar especially if you are a diabetic.Since you have had a severe low, I would suggest that you ask your doctor if you should have a prescription for glucagons. This is a shot that gets your blood sugar up. Most EMTs and ambulance crops do not carry this drug.I hope this helps, Lease check back with us again.",

            "answer": "thank you for your response. I have made a doctors appointment for this Friday. I first requested for a referral to a specialist, but they said I had to see my PCP first. Hopefully, I will get to the bottom of this mystery. And I will sign back on and update any new information that I hope to get from a specialist.",

            "answer": "I had my appt with my pcp last Friday. I am now testing my blood with a glucometer(?) But I'm a little confused. I has me scheduled to see him again a month later. When my mothers' doctor monitored her, it was for 5 days, and then she went back to see him. That's when he diagnosed her with type 2 diabetes.So why is my doctor having me test for a month?Another question:What is considered normal blood sugar levels? He never told me anything, except that I have the symptoms of hypoglacemia. You should have seen me trying to figure out the meter thing!Another question:What does it take for a doctor to figure out if I have diabetes or not?I asked my sister what are normal blood sugar, she said 70 to 150. But when I asked a friend who is a nurse practitioner, said normal blood sugar is 50-100. (I would trust my friend over my sister any day) My sister cheats with her type 2.Based on the past few days of testing, my levels range from 83 to 190, from am to the bedtime. Once my level tested 267, but I have not yet experienced a low blood sugar. I never know when they will happen.My doctor did have me wean off my beta blocker blood pressure medicine for ten days, then I start on a new BP medication. The atenolol can drop a persons blood sugar. (this medicine was prescribed by another doctor-who knew of family history with diabetes) This doctor was a nightmare waiting to happen. While under his care with my blood pressure issues, he just up and disappeared. My current doctor told me last Friday he was fired.Doesn't do a whole lot for my trust in doctors. What I really wanted was for my pcp to refer me to an endocrinologist.",

    "question": "I had a gastric by-pass revision in 1992. So I don't know if that has anything to do with having low blood sugar problems today. I get tested every year for diabetes, (sister & mother have it). Everytime the test comes back negative. Yet on a regular basis I experience low blood sugar. It will hit me any time, any where unexpectedly. I know its coming on, because I get an odd, hollow hungry feeling in the pit of my stomach. Then the shakes start, and then I'll start to sweat. I never skip breakfast anymore, because I nearly collapsed at work after doing that. The worst happened at home when I was nearly unconscious, when my son called 911. My blood sugar then, was 40, the EMT's told me. As soon as I eat something with substance, bread/meat/glass of milk, etc, then I was okay. But my doctor has never been able to diagnose me with diabetes. Earlier on, after the gastric bypass the doctors then, told me the low bloodsugar was due to the bypass. I'm very concerned that my health may become severely affected because my blood sugar is not staying normal. What do you suggest for tests that would give the doctor the best results? I have been tested for diabetes before eating, and after eating, each time the test was negative. Thank you",
