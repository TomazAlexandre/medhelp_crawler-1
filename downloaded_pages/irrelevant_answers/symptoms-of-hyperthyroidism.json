    "question": "Since I was in my 20's, 20 years ago, I have had most of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Recently, I was tested for it, and I tested negative. What other medical problems could I test for? My symptoms are: high anxiety, poor memory, optimism, and malabsorption of food. I believe I have malabsorption because I must eat much food, especially protein, to reduce the symptoms, and because my concentration becomes very poor by 5:00 or 6:00 PM.",
