In fact i usually \"empty\" in the afternoon and it almost always seems to start after I have. Then it is quite bothersome until i wake up the next morning. Also, It hasn't woke me up while sleeping.",

Anxiety is also a possibilty, prolonged sitting, prostatitis is still a factor. It doesn't make sense the antibiotic i was taking seemed to fix it, but it comes back when i discontinue taking it. I am pretty sure it is not something i can take the rest of my life, but for the 100% fix it gave me, id almost rather cut my life expectancy in half just to live that half without the constant urge to urinate. So confusing. So annoying. So depressing...",

            "answer": "Hello,Without examination confirmation of a diagnosis is tough but urge of frequent urination can be due to increased intake of fluids or diabetes mellitus.Other possibilities are glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis(inflammation of the kidneys),urinary tract infection,hypercalcemia,hypokalemia(low potassium),hyperthyroidism,hyperparathyroidism,diuretic drugs and benign hyperplasia of the prostate(in elderly males).In my opinion, investigations like kidney functions, blood sugar levels, ultrasound lower abdomen ,intravenous pyelography ,prostate specific antigen blood test,thyroid function tests and cystoscopy may be needed to confirm a diagnosis.I sincerely advise you to consult a urologist or nephrologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.Kind regards.",

            "answer": "Hi I very much doubt that it has to do with your prostate.I first started to have prostatis problems at the age of about 23. With this I experienced a lot of discomfort with the urge to urinate constantly with a strong urgency.Now being 45 I still have it.Inflamation of the prostate has the same systems of discomfort and pain. You claim that there is no pain but just the urination part.I don't understand as to why your doctor gave you antibiotics for your prostate after stating that it is soft. A urine culture and or sample of the prostate after the digital rectal exam could have indicated if there was a problem. I have heard doctors tell me that my prostate felt boggy and sometimes firm.I allways have had a lot of discomfort when it had to do with my prostate.There could be something else at work causing you to have a sensation of urination. As Dr. J mentioned diabetes could be one of the main causes. Ask your doctor for a fasting glucose test. It would be neccessary to rule out diabetes and other potential serious medical conditions before it can be dismissed as anxiety.All the best,Ron",

            "answer": "Sorry I missed the part where you say that it usually starts after having a bowel movement. This indeed shows suspiscian of prostatitis. The problem is that the fact that you don't have discomfort does not fit with the symptoms of prostatitis or inflamation there off. Since the prostate is close in relation to the rectum it could be irritating that part of the urethra causing the sensation of urination.Do you urinate normaly when you do urinate? what is the amount of urine? Lots or hardly any at all? If you urinate normal amounts of urine than there has to be a reason for it. Are your stools firm and possibly causing the prostate to become irritated? Perhaps you could change your diet to ensure that the stool is not hard.I hope that you can find an answer for this. When I have prostatis and the urge to urinate, I only produce small quantities and at times even not at all, but the sensation is there.Good luck,Ron",

            "answer": "Well with the constant feeling that i need to go, If i always went i wouldn't usually produce that much urine, but i usually wait until im sure i have to go and then urine is normal in amount, color, feeling, smell, etc. I've just kind of 'adapted' so I know when i really need to go. About the stool firmness it is normal id say, depending on what I've eaten. What would you recommend i change in my diet? I weigh 130, so weight problems are not an issue. I will definetly take into consideration the above mentioned tests. They took a blood sample for diabetes once. Would that still not rule out the possibility for it? Should i ask for a more in depth testing for diabetes? It is just strange the antibiotic i was give for prostatitis seemed to take care of the problem but within only a day or two of being off of it the problem comes back. I will surely be updating with the latest on what I/my doctor have thoughts on. Thank you all for your help so far, i really want to clear this up as I'm young and will be starting school in a few weeks.",

            "answer": "Hi,If you had only one blood test for diabetes than there is still a chance that it could not have been abnormal during the time that the blood sample was taken. Ask for a fasting glucose test.For eating as long as the stools are not hard than continue with what you have been eathing.For myself currently I have a fistula between the rectum and prostate. At times it does bother me after or during a bowel movement.If the antibiotics gave you some relief, porstatitis cannot be ruled out. It is just odd that you don't seem to have other syptoms that go a long with this.I myself have had prostatitis on and off from the age of 22 to 23 to currently. Antibiotics do clear for a while and than seem to come back.Prostatitis does not always mean that there has to be a UTI (urinary tract infection) at the same time. Prostatitis is an inflamation. Certain meds could be given to combat the inflamation.All the bestRon",

            "answer": "Well i have another update. I'm scheduled to see the urologist on the 14th. They gave me another 2 weeks worth of the antibiotics and ive taken it for two days so far, but for the last 3 or so days things have gotten stranger. I have had about the same urge, maybe not quite as bad, but added to that i have almost a tingling feeling, and for the past two days i have had the constant feeling to poop. It's a constant pressure that i have to poop. Now that I'm back on the antibiotic the urination problem is subsiding some but this is worse, I almost feel sick and sometimes it feels almost like I lose feeling in my genital region. It's very uncomofortable. Any ideas what it could be? Maybe I'm just constipated but it seems more than that.",

            "answer": "Well i have been away for quite some time, but i have an update.I made it through a year of school with basically no problems...basically...I had a month off for Christmas break and went back to work. (I do construction/carpentry work which is quite strenuous) Over this period of time I was living at home and working and towards the end of the break i had this problem come back just a little bit but as soon as I moved back to school the problem subsided.Well school is over and I've been home for a few weeks and back to work and the problem is coming back. Now i have it narrowed down to two possible reasons, either its the stress that comes with being around my parents...or...and this is what I'm leaning towards...it's the strenuous activity.When i am at school I have very little strenuous activity, but while working I have much...if any of you have done roofing or something similar you know what i mean...now if the increased physical activity is the reason, why is it the reason?

            "answer": "Hi, I'm sorry that I don't have any answers for you but I can tell you that I have many of the same problems that you have.I often exprience the strong urge to urinate. Some times it is difficult for me to distinguish between the sensation of urination or needing to have a bowel movement.Over the last few years I have had many sleepless nights because of this. It is difficult to sleep when you feel as if you need to have a bowel movement.Don't let the urologists or other doctors dismiss you as having nothing wrong.I have been diagnosed as having a neurogenic bladder but have unexplained problems with irritable bowel syndrome.I also have have hd neumerous cases of UTI, when I have that the feeling of needing to urinate is almost constant. Than when I go there is very little urine or non at all.I also have have had problems with prostatitis. The urologists have not been able to find a cuase for it.I have undergone many cystospies, gastroscopies, endoscopies etc. No real cause found other than swelling in the colon.Don't give up some doctor should be able to help you or direct you to others that can. I suggest that you look into further infestigation and treatment of protatitis. As I have mentioned your symptoms are very close to the ones that I experience. I have been on Indocid supposetories to try and treat inflamation of the prostate. Some other supossetories were tried as well.I have some idea as to what you are going through, at your age you should not have this. Keep me posted as things proceed. I sincerely hope that you will be able to find help. I have dealth with prostatits from about the age of 20 up to now at 46.All the best.Ron",

            "answer": "I have been really busy and haven't gotten to the doctor yet. I'm not real thrilled about going back...I'm really sorry to hear you have had problems for such a long time, I don't know how you have been able to put up with it for so long, I think i would have gone crazy by now!!I'm just going to recap how it has been bothering me since it came back this summer:It has never interfered with my sleep.It bothers me just a little bit in the mornings, but is mainly not noticeable until the afternoons. 3:00p.m. would be a rough estimate of when it starts to bother.I have never had pain due to it.I've noticed if i get really focused on something it doesn't bother me until i lose focus on whatever it was I was doing (which makes sense i suppose).It is most noticeable after a bowel movement or after urinating and as i start to drink more and my bladder starts filling up more it basically goes away and then when i actually have to urinate a 'normal' amount I have the usual feeling of having to urinate.I have been tested for diabetes, don't seem to have that.It is NOT a UTI, i can't count how many times they've tested me for that.The antibiotics i took for prostatitis seemed to get rid of the feeling until i was off of them.( I think maybe they were suppose to help with inflammation, but not 100% sure)The prescription i was taking was one 400mg tablet of Ofloxacin once a day for two weeks.When i went to the Urologist he tested to be sure my bladder was emptying and there were no problems there.The best description i can give of it is a feeling to have to urinate, kind of like my bladder is irritated maybe. Its similar to that feeling of when you really have to go and you can barely hold it in.Like i was saying earlier, its worst in the afternoon and progresses through the night. I've noticed when i go to sleep if i lay on my stomach it doesn't bother me as much so it's easier to get to sleep.Oh and Ron, I noticed you enjoy computers, videos, music, and mechanics. My life is computers, cars, movies, and music. Thought that was interesting we have similar symptoms and similar interests. Do you work with different operating systems? Linux, Mac, Windows, etc...",

            "answer": "I forgot to mention a few other things.When it is really bothering me it seems like I am \"gassy\".And sometimes, on rare occasions my stool will be soft, almost to the point of diarrhea. But I've noticed when the soft stool happens it seems to be when I'm really dwelling on the problem which could make that stress related...or it could just be what i ate. I don't think that is anything worth worrying about though, just thought I'd add that.Oh and I thought I'd just mention that I have had one concussion from falling backwards off of a toolbox in the back of a pickup. I was standing on the toolbox and my dog jumped up and me, causing me to hit my head on the garage door opener and i then fell straight back onto the cement floor head first with the full force of my body on it ...I would say the distance my head feel was 8-9 feet.\u00a0\u00a0I don't remember what grade of a concussion it was, but i assume since I lost consciousness it was grade 3.I also rolled my 4-wheeler a few years ago and had to wear a cast for quite a few months. I didn't break the bones, but instead, twisted them. If you feel my forearms you can tell the bones in the left one are twisted in a different direction than the right one, but its not really noticeable by sight.Just thought I'd mention that, in case that could have created an underlying problem that went unnoticed at the time.",

            "answer": "Folks, after following this thread I feel strongly the poster up top hit the nail on the head. The problem in my non-professional opinion is that the kidneys are inflamed or are working too hard. There are several reasons for this conclusion as I have studied Chinese herbs and acupuncture for 20 years.One important clue is the poster above noted that around 3 pm the symptoms pick up. That is close to the time that according to acupuncture body meridians the kidneys and urinary bladder are at their height. Also another poster said sleeping on his stomach helped which takes the pressure off the kidney area at night.Also, anti-biotics never helped.The cure would be acupuncture of the spleen which has a direct sedating effect on the kidneys that are inflamed. I know it is hard for western doctors to understand that this is a spleen issue, but the spleen has a direct relationship on the kidneys.What can cause this? Drugs such as cocaine that stimulate the kidney areas and hurt it. Drugs such as viagra that keep the kidney areas in a state of constant action. Prescription drugs that stimulate the kidneys. Too much sex can effect this also. And also the old stand by \"heredity\" that says this person has overly Yang meridians in the kidney area.Something is stimulating the kidneys and they need rest. I recommend going to see a Chinese acupuncturist and within 4 hours of being acupunctured the symptom would probably go away. He can also give herbs that sedate the kidney region.Hope this helps.",

    "question": "For quite a few months now I have been having a problem where i always feel like I have to urinate. I have no pain, no burning, no stinging, nothing. It tends to worsen as the day goes on and many times i wont notice it until later in the afternoon. I am 18 years old, have no std's and it is not a UTI (have been tested many times). I originally thought it was an irritation from Orange Juice becuase i was drinking a lot of it, so i quit drinking it and haven't had it since. I also have went away from drinking carbonated beverages and have had maybe 3 pops in the last 5 or so months. Then i thought maybe it was a form of diabetes, but they tested my blood and didn't seem to think it was that.\u00a0\u00a0Well the urge went away for a while but has come back a few times since. I have been to my family doctor a few times and the last time i went he said my prostate was a bit soft so he gave me a medicine for prostatitis and that took care of it, but after i ran out of the medicine the feeling came back, so he gave me another 2 weeks worth of it and said if it wasn't cured this time we need to move on to something else. Well i have been off the medicine for about 2 days and the feeling is back. It really interferes with my daily life. Any ideas on what this could be? I am sick of going to the doctor and having this feeling every day.",
