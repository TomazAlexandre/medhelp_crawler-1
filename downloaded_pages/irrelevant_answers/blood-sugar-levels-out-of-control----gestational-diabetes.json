I'm not on any medication and for the past few weeks have been able to control it with my diet... I just dont get it... because one day I will eat something and the sugar levels are fine... other days I will eat the exact same thing and it will be high... I dont understand!! Plus my fasting levels have been high too... I just dont want to be put on medication and if they go for insulin there is NO WAY I will be able to inject myself. .. any advice on what to do???",
