            "answer": "\"have added back cereal and some ice cream (no sugar added).\"Cereals are high in simple carbohydrates. Carbs raise blood sugar levels like sugar does. No sugar added ice cream means no sugar added to the existing sugar which is pretty high in the first place. Read all nutrition labels carefully. Carb sugars are listed in grams, a cooking measure. Every 7 grams equals one HEAPING Tablespoon of sugar.As far your doctor is he/she an Endocrinologist, a doctor who trained and specializes with the endocrine system, one being diabetes treatment and management? If not, get a referral to one and also to diabetes nutritionist and/or dietitian. They can help you with your eating habits and portion sizes. Good luck -",

    "question": "If I happen to eat something sweet, say a bowl of cereal at night, my morning bg is regularly in the 80's (this morning it was 54), if I don't eat anything before bed, my bg may be 114. I take 1 metformin in the morning. My A1C was 426 almost a year ago. I have changed my eating habits, sodas etc and was really strict for a while but slowly have added back cereal and some ice cream (no sugar added). Also, my eyes seem worse the lower my bg is? Instead of answering my questions, my Dr says I'm doing fine. Oh, I did start with a pill in the morning and 1 at night, my bg was 52 several months ago and my Dr took me off the night pill. Weight is currently about 320 and was 387 when this started.",
