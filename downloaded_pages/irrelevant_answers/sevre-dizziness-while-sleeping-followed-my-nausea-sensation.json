            "answer": "Dear Atul, welcome to the medhelp forum. There are various possibilities or dizziness and you have a long history of nearly 15 years. You need a detailed cardiac evaluation to rule out high or low blood pressure, arrhythmias, and diseased heart muscle or heart valve lesions. Brain conditions like migraines and tumor need to be checked for. You may be suffering from hyperventilation due to sleep apnea in case you are obese. Metabolic conditions like dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, diabetes, side effects of medications if you are having any need to be evaluated by a physician. Anemia and vestibular disease could also cause dizziness. I strongly suggest you to consult a physician for detailed clinical assessment. Hope these speculations help in narrowing the diagnosis and appropriate therapy. Wish you all the best.",

    "question": "Hi,I am 29 years old male and quite healthy person who works out regulary. My problem is that I have been having dizziness in sleep since I was around 14 or 15 years old. At that time I had consulted an ENT and he had not been able to give me a proper answer or treatment to the problem. In the beginning years it used to be so severe that I used to throw up after the dizziness and had to take off the entire next day. Now I think that my body has grown used to it and I don't have much issues but a heavy hangover and nauseating feeling for about half a day. The main thing I have notices is that it happens during early morning and only in sleep. Earlier I used to think that it happens if I take certain food on the previous day, mostly seafood or due to extreme fatigue. But I have ruled out both. Also it is recurring after the first time it happens during the sleep, i.e, if i have it once in the sleep and again try going back to sleep it will come back again and hence my entire sleep is disturbed. The interval between the bouts of this attack is not fixed. For eg, before I had an attack today, the last one I don't remember when it happened but maybe around 2 months back. I have also ruled out spontilitis since I don't have any related symptoms.Pl help..looking for answers.Atul",
