            "answer": "Your life expectancy needn't be any shorter than a non-diabetic, as long as you keep your blood sugar under reasonably good control. And if you keep yopur HBA1c below 6.5, you probably won't get any complications either.Having said that, you will find that keeping good control gets more difficult as the honeymoon period wears off. But with the excellent insulins and and delivery devices available now, you shouldn't have a problem maintaining good control.I have been a type 1 for 28 years now. And the only complication I have is some minimal retinopathy. It is the result of many years of sub-optimal control. But I have refined the system now and brought my HBA1c below 6.5. I expect the retinopathy clear up altogher. And, as long as\u00a0\u00a0I can maintain this level of control, I shouldn't have any other problems.Technology has progressed to the point where being a T1 doesn't have to be a problem. Type 2s are not as fortunate because they also have to deal with elevated insulin levels, which lead to heart disease. But if you look after yourself, you will be fine.Merry Christmas,Mark",
