            "answer": "Hi,Here is what I've been doing, to stop my diabetes 2 progression, the first part is :Always\u00a0\u00a0follow Dr. Beirstein rule:(6,12,12) meaning in the morning I allow myself to consume only 6 gram of carbohydrate. These days , I can buy big a tortilla with low-carb at Walmart with only 6gram of carb. I remember the name\u00a0\u00a0is The tortilla factory. To fight hunger, I eat\u00a0\u00a0natural , no salt Almonds and peanuts available at Costco and Walgreen.In my opinion that only low-carb (6, 12,12) will stablelize your blood glucose. You can buy this book or at least read the reviews of this book :Diabetes Solution by Dr. Beirstein by log in on Amazon.com. There has been many lives, many diabetic 2 lifes have been saved by reading this book, by this Dr methode. Sadly, in my opinion, there are many more incompetent diabetes\u00a0\u00a0Doctors.To lower my A1c, I have been using my own herb, a combination of\u00a0\u00a0other herbs, to lower my blood sugar. At this point I am NOT ready to discuss about it.Here are some foods, some herbs, that you can buy at the market to lower your glucose reading:The number 1 is Drink or make\u00a0\u00a0juice from bitter melon, available at Asian markets.Fresh cabbag. Bean sprout. You must monitor your glucose reading at least 2 times a day.Do you know that any diabetic that use Insulin must inject the needle to their body at least 6, 8 times a day. Butis Insulin effective enough to stop the diabetes2 progression? Please google it, then make your own conclusion.To me hardly, if you read comments from the so-called experts , DRs on diabetes malady, they almost always\u00a0\u00a0write: Overtime, patients must add some other oral diabetes\u00a0\u00a0medications to stop the progression of Diabetes.Why? To me, they conveniently failed to mention:Low-carb, low- carb!Good luck.",

    "question": "Hi all,Let me tell you how I succesfully avoid Insulin or stop my diabetes 2 progression at the gate of Insulin, this is just my personal diabetic journey, I don't want to advise nor diagnose anyone.I am an, 62 years old diabetic 2, a 20 year plus diabetic 2 patience, 14 months ago ,I had leg pains at night, aka neuropathic pains, my A1c was 6.8%, as of now my A1c is 5.6 %,\u00a0\u00a0I no longer had leg pains. I have\u00a0\u00a0NOT, for the last\u00a0\u00a03 years using ANY diabetic medications at all, no Metformin, no Victoza, no nothing.How could I do this to myself, it's very EASY, any fifth grader CAN do it, here is how I have been doing it :I follow this rule:(6,12,12) . Meaning for breakfastss, I only consume 6 grams of Carb, and at lunchs and dinners meals, I allow myself only 12 grams of Carb. These days I can buy such low-carb foods, made by\u00a0\u00a0the Tortilla Factory, tortillas with such low-carb at Wal-mart.This rule invented by Dr. Richard Bernstein, author of this book :Diabetes Solutions\". You can log onto amazon .com to read reviews of this book.The rule is very SIMPLE: to stablize the blood sugar, I always try to LOWER my carb intake.Period, the other way around, to me, is dead wrong.The other half of my diabetic journey is that I am using a herb that I have discovered and developed so effective enough for me to steadily lower myblood glucose A1C to 5.6% , taken 12.28.11.So effective enough to eliminate my diabetic nerve complications: Leg pains. My \"T cell\" is dramatically improved.I am pretty confident to say that, in 2 or 3 years from now , as my A1C keep lowering, I will take the OGGT test to find out or to prove that if I am clinically cured from diabetes 2.Here are my personal assessement, observations on diabetes 2:Threre are so many falses, misconceptions about this horrible malady:To me: Anyone who average 2 cans of sugary drinks a day for 10 years is already a pre-daibetic 2, or\u00a0\u00a0diabetic 2. To test yourself, go buy the self-test kit called A1C Now, made by Bayer, available at Wal-mart, Walgreens, for $23 USD test yourself , within 5-10 minutes, voila you will have the results. This kit is VERY reliable.Any diabetic 2 who doesNOT know what is the A1C number is, or doNOT monitor your blood glucose daily\u00a0\u00a0is GIVING UP the fight against this horrible disease.The 2 must-have things to any diabetic 2 are: Reading the book:Diabetes Solutions by DR. Richard Beirnstein\u00a0\u00a0and having a reliable personal sugar monitor, cost less than $20 USD, I now use One Touch . Why? There are so many false infos , deadly\u00a0\u00a0infos like:\"Water melon is a friendly food\" , and \"glucerna\"\u00a0\u00a0to me, personally they are VERY harmful\u00a0\u00a0to any diabetes 2,Why , using a reliable blood sugar monitor to test your glucose ONE hour after consuming the food, not 2 hour if it is less than 140 is then that food is OK.To me I try\u00a0\u00a0avoid Insulin as long as I couldbecause high level of Insulin is known to:Hypoglycemia, a deadly medical situation. High blood pressure, Weigh gaining...Expensive and Inconvenience.Thanks for reading. Have a nice day and Good Luck.",
