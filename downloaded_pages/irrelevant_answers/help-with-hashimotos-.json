            "answer": "It can get confusing, but your thoughts are backward.\u00a0\u00a0High TSH indicates hypo, low TSH indicates hypER.\u00a0\u00a0Low FT4 indicates hypO, meaning that your thyroid is not producing enough hormone;\u00a0\u00a0High FT4 indicates hypER, meaning that your thyroid is producing too much hormone.Your TSH is \"in range\", some would say \"perfect\";\u00a0\u00a0while your FT4 is below range, indicating that you are hypo because your thyroid is not producing enough hormone.\u00a0\u00a0That said, however, you need to have an FT3 done as well, as FT3 is the hormone that correlates best with symptoms.Are you currently on any thyroid med?\u00a0\u00a0If so, what med(s) and what dosage?",

            "answer": "No - vaccinations do not trigger Hashimoto's....... Hashimoto's Thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease in which your body produces antibodies that \"see\" your thyroid as a foreign thing; the antibodies, then begin to \"attack\" your thyroid and will eventually destroy it, so it can no longer produce adequate hormones.In your case, with both TSH *and* thyroid hormones (FT3 and FT4) being low, it could be that you might have a pituitary issue. Your thyroid is not producing enough hormones, but your pituitary may not \"know that\", so isn't sending out the TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) to tell your thyroid to produce hormones.......You need to find a doctor who will take your symptoms into account first, then evaluate your FT3 and FT4 values, along with the low TSH.\u00a0\u00a0You could have more than one issue going on.........",

            "answer": "When searching for an Endo, be aware that not all are good thyroid doctors.\u00a0\u00a0Many specialize in diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Many have the \"Immaculate TSH Belief\", and do not pay attention to the more important tests for free T3 and free T4.When trying to find a good thyroid doctor, I have found a good approach.\u00a0\u00a0I call the office and say that I'm looking for a good thyroid doctor but before making an appointment I have a few questions I'd like to ask of one of the nurses.\u00a0\u00a0This has never failed to get a nurse on the phone with me.\u00a0\u00a0Then I ask if the doctor is willing to test and adjust free T3 and free T4 with whatever meds are necessary to relieve symptoms, without being constrained by resultant TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0I also ask if the doctor is willing to prescribe meds other than the T4 only types.\u00a0\u00a0If the answer to either question is no, then don't bother with an appointment, just keep on looking.Relative to your doctor saying to come back only when you are having real problems,\u00a0\u00a0I think you will find this article to be of interest.http://thyroid.about.com/od/hypothyroidismhashimotos/a/preventative.htm",

            "answer": "Often autoimmune diseases have a genetic link; other times, they \"come out of the blue\" - for instance, my son was diagnosed with type I diabetes (autoimmune) at age 10.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor told us that, for whatever reason, he thought that it might come from my side of the family; however, we had no diabetes at all in my family that we knew of.\u00a0\u00a0We treated his diabetes for many years, then, lo and behold, I had a nephew who is older than my son, diagnosed, then later still, my oldest sister was diagnosed at close to 70 yrs old.In regards to thyroid issues, again, in my case, we've never had any; however, less than a year before I was diagnosed hypo/Hashi's, my sister who is 2 yrs older than me, was diagnosed.My point is: even if you don't have a family history, there's always got to be a place to start...... additionally, maybe you had family members who DID have thyroid issues and didn't know it, just like apparently, my family has had diabetes (and thyroid) issues, but we didn't know it.\u00a0\u00a0Remember, years ago, people died and no one knew why - often it was put down to \"consumption\", which could have been anything, including diabetes, thyroid issues, cancer, etc and they didn't have the means to test for it, like we do today.In regards to the chlorine issue - I'd have to say, that's rather unlikely. Water treatment is my \"line of work\";\u00a0\u00a0I am a licensed water treatment operator and I deal with chlorine on a daily basis.\u00a0\u00a0While there are some compounds produced when chlorine reacts with organics in the water, I've never heard of this being an issue specifically with thyroid.Additionally, the EPA sets specific limits on the levels of chlorine allowed in your drinking water - if you suspect that those levels are too high, you need to contact the supplier of your potable (drinking) water.\u00a0\u00a0If you are on a private well, this would not be an issue, unless you chlorinate the water as it's pumped to your house, or pour chlorine into the well.All of that said - I agree with gimel.\u00a0\u00a0The cortisol issue needs to be addressed, with a very high priority.",

            "answer": "I think you might still be confused about the test results and what they indicate.High TSH and low FT4 and/or FT3 indicate hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, based on your TSH, typically, nothing would have been done, since it's at a very good level.The fact that your FT4 is at the very bottom of the range, does raise a red flag, though, and you should have had an FT3 done.You might well have benefited from a low dose of replacement hormones.",
