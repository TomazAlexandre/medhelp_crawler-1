    "question": "Hi all,I wrote sometime back expressing my fears for possible GD. So i had my glucose test two thursdays ago and the results were positive - GD - I live in Africa and i dont know if my Dr was over reacting but i was admitted in hospital for a week - I was put on Insulin and i actually now have to inject myself 3X a day. I am not on any other medication and i monitor my sugar levels every morning and evening. I dont know what your experience is - please share. I am 28 weeks pregnant and this is my 2nd - i didnt have GD with my first, though he was very big at birth and then i was diagnosed with PCOS when we were ttcing for the 2nd one and i have diabetes in the family.",
