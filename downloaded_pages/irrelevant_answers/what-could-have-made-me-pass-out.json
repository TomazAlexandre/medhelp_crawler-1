            "answer": "The fact you were provided with an intravenous volume expander suggests simple dehydration, as redstar mentioned. Usually there is a co-factor such as anemia. Rarely is there a disease that prevents the vasculature from compensating when standing up (Parkinson's being such a disease). Since you have had no additional episodes I wouldn't be overly concerned.",

    "question": "This was several years ago (more than 5) and it never happened before or since then. but it was weird...last thing i rememberd was standing up during dinner (my parents say I said i felt sick but i dont remember that) and then a burst of color and i was on the floor, fully coherent and wondering why i was on the floor. Seems i fainted.So I remember my dad helping me up and then i was on the floor again, fully coherent. so i remember being helped into a chair and drinking some water, thinking i was fine cause of the sitting. I said iwas gonna get some rest, and started to get up and then i was on the floor sitll fully coherent. By this time, the paramedics had shown up.I remember them helping me up to bring me to the hospital and then i was on a gurney fully coherent.It may have happened 4-6 times. since it was winter and the paramedics had their place robbed, their ambulance was cold..they gave me IV fluid after warning me (OW, by the way.) of the cold. I did not pass out again. hung out at the hospital in bed til an iv thing was done, helped up to walk with a nurse holding onto me, and I did not pass out. That was at least 5 years ago, maybe 6. I havent passed out at all since then....So..what was that about?! I cant remember a diagnosis. Its bizarre right?!",
