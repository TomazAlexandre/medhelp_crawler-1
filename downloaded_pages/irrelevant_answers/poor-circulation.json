I also suffer from Graves' Disease and have wondered if these are related. I am trying to find out how I can prevent permanent damage to my fingers as they go white and \"dead\" for up to 2 hours (2 fingers left hand particularly) before going purple and returning to normal....",

            "answer": "Hi,Your symptoms could be due to thyroid dysfunction. Hyperthyroidism can cause loss of hair, dry hair as also lack of vitamins and minerals in the diet.Poor circulation especially to the extremities can occur due to peripheral vascular diseases or diabetes. Peripheral vascular disease is more common in smokers.If you have a history of smoking this possibility is worth looking into.Thanks",

            "answer": "Hi there,No I am not a smoker at all, I exercise every day and apart from the Graves' am in pretty good health. I also take vit. B/D and a mix of other minerals since I know I tend to be low on magnesium (probably because I exercise a lot - although not excessively) But if diabetes is a possibility i should get that looked into?",

            "answer": "I would definitely have your blood tested for hyper or hypothyroidism. Whenever my Graves' plays up I go hyper and suffer pretty much those symptoms. You could have any type of thyroid disorders, not just hypo (i put on weight when I am hyper!!).Also a strong recommendation - go eat glutenfree. Whilst your symptoms may not be due to celeiac, you definitely support good nutrition and absorption of nutrients (all needed to keep your immune system as healthy and strong as possible) by eating gluten free. I have been on GF for 3 years and feel sooooo much better!",
