            "answer": "I would wait to start self-inducing until 37 weeks. I know you're eager. I am, too, and I'm 36w2d. However, when you fo start inducing, SEX. It's the most natural way of inducing I can think of. The seminal fluid thins and irritates the cervix and the rocking and contractions of orgasm can cause actual contractions for you. Best of luck, hun.",
