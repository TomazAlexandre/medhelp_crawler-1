            "answer": "Hi!Yes, it is possible to get pregnant while you are on uterine implants. At times the urine test is negative and there is an ectopic pregnancy. This shows up in an ultrasound or in a blood pregnancy test.The other possibility is severe acidity along with polycystic ovary or diabetes or a thyroid disorder. If pregnancy is completely ruled out then these disorders should be looked into.Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "Hello,Chances of pregnancy due to Mirena failure are there. Hence to confirm the status of pregnancy, I suggest you to test for pregnancy by a highly sensitive pregnancy test 10 days post ovulation with a sensitive ( 20 - 25 mIU ) pregnancy test. Also then I would suggest you to get your serum HCG levels estimated since this is more specific than urine for pregnancy tests.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
