            "answer": "Sue: What would make you think it is related to kidney or liver. I take atenolol as well as several other meds similar to yours. How long has it been since you had labs done?\u00a0\u00a0The lab work always shows you Liver Function test and Kidneys as well. They seem to come together. You may just have an allergic reaction to some med. I've had those before only a prescription antihistimine worked. Plus finding out what the source of the allergie was. Yes part of liver problems involve itching, when your biliruben goes up. I'm not an expert. Just offering my opinion. Take Care\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cat",

Meds- none new but I do take atenolol rapid heart beat .Ambien. lipitor, prozac.325 mg. aspirin, daily. The finger tips bother me most. Both hands started at the same time so I doubt because of this that it would be carpal tunnel?\u00a0\u00a0i was tested for diabetes recently and it was negative =.there is a family history . Help i am really itchy- have had some bumps ( ratches) but it is not always present along with symptoms.
