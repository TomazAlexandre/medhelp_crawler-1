            "answer": "murmurs are not that I know brought on by being sick .It's probably something you have had your whole life and the doctors never heard it before , or it started to come on gradually as your are aging. I would I an echo to see the murmur so the the doctors can grade the amount of leakage you have. If the leakage is trace or mild they will just have you come every few years to check it . If it is moderate to severe you will have it check appox. every year. There is a wealth of information on this site in the form of archived posts that you can read about your murmur. As far as the exercise doctors usually recommend that you do ,to keep the heart strong. But you need to get your echo and talk to your doctor to see where you stand and get his recommendations .",

    "question": "I was told that I have a heart murmur and was recommended to have an echo gram. I currently have pneumonia and blood pressure elevated 149/84, pulse 84, oc level 96 wt. 162. had a fever between 99.6 ,102.4 past three days. My concern is ,is this something that can be brought on by my condition or has it been there for awhile and is it something I need to keep a look at. Heart disease, diabetes\u00a0\u00a0and cancer is high in my immediate family.I have just recently started a running program to run a marathon, should I get this tested before I commit to such training.( running is a new journey for me )ThanksBrendaSue916",
