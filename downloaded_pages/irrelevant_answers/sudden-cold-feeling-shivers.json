I have noted some patients having this experience and in their case it was due to either an infection(especially in the renal dialysis catheter) or the dialysate itself.I am afraid the renal folks are better for answering this question that myself, sorry.The weight loss is common in individuals with chronic kidney disease, and I am very glad it has stabilized in your case.I am sorry I could not offer further suggestions. All the best to you.",

    "question": "I am a 62 year old british indian male who 3 years ago started APD kidney dialysis.\u00a0\u00a0I have had diabetes for some 20+ years and only about 6 years ago moved to insulin injection.\u00a0\u00a0I have/had high blood pressure.I am dialysising well, but in the last two / three months I have started to loose weight (although this seems to have stabilised) but in addition I seem to have a sudden extremely cold feeling throughout the body, almost like a chill.\u00a0\u00a0I require something hot to get me warmed up which within seconds is gone and I am back to normal.My renal clinic watches my bloods closesly and they say they can't see anything and obviously I can't re-produce the symptom but its seems to be getting worse (I also tihnk it seems to only happen in the evening).Anyone got any comments/experience or pointers.",
