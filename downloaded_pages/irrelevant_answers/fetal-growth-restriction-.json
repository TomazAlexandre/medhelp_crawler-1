            "answer": "I have to go to a fetal specialist Wednesday to see why my baby is small. They think he might not be growing too well cause I'm tiny and my fundal measurements are 4 weeks behind .. My cousin is an OBGYN and she said its common to be induced at 37 weeks bc of growing problems. Are you a small woman?",

            "answer": "I'm having twins and one of my babies is slow growing. I'm seeing a specialist and he said if baby stops growing, they will deliver them early. Already had my steroids last week. I'm 33 weeks. If you are 37 weeks, your baby has a very high success rate. The baby will be fine, they can get the baby more nutrients out than in.",

            "answer": "Thats what my OBGYN told me. I am pritty small. Moat people say that my belly looks like im 3 months pregnant. I go to an altrosound specialist now twice a week. They told me that she has poor fetal growth. I believe shes a week or two behind. What scares me is that they told me that this can cause the babys oxygen circulation to stop. So they told me to make sure that shes moving. They told me that it's safer to deliver her earlier. Im glad that I found someone with the same story. Thank you.",

I am only a small person as well, and I had gestational diabetes!! Lol. Anyway he soon piled on the weight after he was horn and started breast feeding, I'm sure your baby will be fine:)",
