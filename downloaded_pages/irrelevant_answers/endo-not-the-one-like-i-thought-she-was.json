I think they do that so you can't argue with them.Your idea of using your PCP may be the best idea at this point.You'd still have to find an Endo for Diabetes, but there seem to be more of those to pick and choose from.Good luck with whatever you decide.",

I like to be at 1.5 which is where I feel best- but the doctors all seem to think normal range is normal. It's not!",
