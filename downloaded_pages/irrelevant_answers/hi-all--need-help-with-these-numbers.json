            "answer": "Don't know if the T3/T4 would have looked better at seven in the morning or not. Your TSH isn't real high, so I think the low Ts are not a true reflection of what is going on daily.Don't know much about the other tests, either. LOL!!It sounds like you are making progress and have a plan to make more progress. Thats great!I'll let the people who know what they're talking about discuss your tests. Just wanted to say congrats on feeling better. :-)",

            "answer": "Thyroid hormone levels do not require a fasting blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0They don't change significantly from day to day, or whether or not you took your medication on a single day.If you are a Graves patient, you'll want your TSH levels between 1.0 and 2.0.\u00a0\u00a0Doing so will bring up your FT4 slightly.But your thyroid numbers don't look all that bad.\u00a0\u00a0Your A1c looks great.\u00a0\u00a0Wish I could get there.\u00a0\u00a0I'm on some hefty medications because of thyroid issues and they have caused considerable weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0Almost makes me wish I was hyper again.Dianne",

            "answer": "Hi hon.Just wrote a long post - tapped a button and deleted the whole thing. Geez - I hate that.I think you need to tweek the Armour up. Increase 1/4 grain two weeks then another 1/4 and retest.The TSH is not low enough and the free T's are off too. Should be higher at least the 3'sI'll hook up with you some time today.",

            "answer": "Test 4 to 6 weeks - but increase 1/4 taglet every two weeks . This way you are testing every month to monitor your levels. and you will find where you need to be.Steady pace.Bad thing on Armour........ you are stiffer in the muscles if you fall short on meds. That's just a fact. It b/c of the short life of the T3 moving around more.Keep in mind - rule of thumb - Lower TSH with Armour and higher Free T3",
