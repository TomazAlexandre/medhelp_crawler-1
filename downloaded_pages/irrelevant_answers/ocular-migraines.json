            "answer": "Hi there.From what you have described, it seems to to me that this is really a complex situation and indeed very hard to ascertain the cause.\u00a0\u00a0Her symptoms may point out to a primary eye problem, like a tortuous blood vessel underneath the retina.\u00a0\u00a0This may be unlikely due to the previous bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0This is most commonly seen in patients with vascular or metabolic problems such as hypertension or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest that she be assessed by an ophthalmologist to see if there are abnormal blood vessels.\u00a0\u00a0If so, these can be treated with laser or local surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Regards and God bless.",

    "question": "maybe you can shed light on this, my girlfriend has been seeing pulsating spots mainly in her peripheral vision since she had an endometrial ablasion done two years ago, she bled heavily prior to that and thats why the procedure was done.she sees these spots 24/7 more in the light and less in a dimly lit room. a neurologist gave her topomax to try, she thought it was helping but couldnt tolerate the drug. her primary doctor gave her metropolol but no real help.she has ne headaches, just the purple pulsating spots. does anyone have a clue what this is? is it related to the heavy bleeding/ menopause/ etc? her eyes are also dry and cloudy at times. thx for your time",
