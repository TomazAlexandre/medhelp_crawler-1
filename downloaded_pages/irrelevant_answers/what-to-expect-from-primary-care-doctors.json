            "answer": "Unfortunately, I have heard this story in many forms about the reaction from doctors. Your distress is understandable but you are doing everything right imho by seeking to educate yourself about your condition and how to manage it. I would get a meter and check your blood sugar regularly rather than wait a year to see how it is doing. Eating \"generally healthy\" and eating healthy for a diabetic may not always be the same thing so do read up on diet, and more important use your meter to see how certain foods affect your blood glucose.",

            "answer": "I will check my BG again in 2010 and see if anything changes because I have increased my efforts to eat even healthier and exercise even more.\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible to maintain a healthy weight and still have relatively elevated glucose levels? That is where I am.\u00a0\u00a0If everything is relative, then it is unfair because I know a number of people who eat chicken fried steak with eggs and hashbrowns for breakfast many days a week at my office cafeteria and nothing better for lunch but I can only imagine what their dinner habits would be.\u00a0\u00a0No exercise eigher.\u00a0\u00a0My diet is nowhere close to anything like that yet my BG is 20 points higher than most of those middle aged men.\u00a0\u00a0That is why I am so disappointed by this but I have to mention my father was diabetic when he died at the age of 58 and so is his younger brother who is now in his seventies.\u00a0\u00a0But I am glad I discovered my high risk of 106 mg/dL early enough.\u00a0\u00a0It was a nurse who suggested I check because she told me that a lot of people who are originally from where I came from tended to have elevated BG levels and I did it reluctantly and there I am.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise I would never have tested my BG without any symptoms.",

            "answer": "Diabetes is not fair. Lots of people who take good care of themselves get diabetes and lots of people who take lousy care of themselves don't.What matters, though, is what you do from now on which WILL have an impact on the progression of your disease. Yes, it is possible to maintain a healthy weight and still have relatively elevated glucose levels. I'm no scientist, but lots of things determine glucose levels, some of which we have control over, some of which we don't. If you stay focused on the ones you can control, you'll do well, emotionally as well as medically. I don't know that I would recommend going that long before you check your BG again, because things can change. I wouldn't recommend obsessing about it either, but somewhere in between daily obsessing and 2010 might be a good balance, imho.",

            "answer": "I really appreciate your advice.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, a nurse practitioner told me pretty much the same thing as you did.\u00a0\u00a0She added not to bother with FBS again and do A1C instead in six months or less.\u00a0\u00a0One of the reasons why I am obssesed with this is because I did not have a baseline before this test so I really don't know where I was a year or two ago with my BG.\u00a0\u00a0So when you say \"things can change\", I know exactly what you mean.\u00a0\u00a0Because things can change at a devastating rate but hopefully things will improve by virue of my intervention.\u00a0\u00a0In any case, I am done obsessing and surfing the internet and I will focus on diet and exercise because that is what I can control.\u00a0\u00a0I will update you on my next test before 2009 ends!",

    "question": "I posted last week but I just could not stop thinking about one other thing.\u00a0\u00a0It is about the very casual reaction from my doctor.\u00a0\u00a0This is how she broke the news to me on the email:\"Dear Mr. xxx,Your\u00a0\u00a0fasting blood sugar was 106.A blood sugar over 125 on a fasting sample indicates diabetes. A normal fasting blood sugar will be 99 or less. As you can see, your blood sugar is just on the border of normal. Lowering the sugar in your diet, keeping your weight at a normal level, and regular exercise can all help prevent diabetes. You should have this re-checked in a year.Sincerely,bbbb cccc, MD\"Does that sound pretty cold or am I just over reacting and looking for sympathy and sugar coated words?\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure but it sounds very casual to me from a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I wrote her back and asked where I would get educational programs per someone's suggestion on this from.\u00a0\u00a0Her substitute doctor replied and she was not much better.\u00a0\u00a0I had clearly indicated on my email that I do have a much better lifestyle than the average person because I exercise a lot and I eat generally healthy.\u00a0\u00a0BP 115/68 last I checked, lipids total 174.\u00a0\u00a0My weight has been within three pounds for the last 8 years, that is when I started checking, BMI less than 24 all the time.\u00a0\u00a0I am almost 34 years old now.\u00a0\u00a0She just told me to write down everything I am eating and bring it to their dietician.\u00a0\u00a0Why would they not take a few extra minutes and attempt to educate me on diabetes and prediabetes?\u00a0\u00a0I probably have educated myself more than they know because there is a tone of information on the internet.\u00a0\u00a0The email went back and forth and every time, the answer was re-check in a year.\u00a0\u00a0Is this the normal way people go through when they are completely taken by surprise and distressed?\u00a0\u00a0I am pretty sure I am over-reacting but I thought I check back with the good people of this forum lest I am missing something here.Thank you very much!",
