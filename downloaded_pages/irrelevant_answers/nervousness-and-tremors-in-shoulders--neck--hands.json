I would definitly talk to your Dr. on this tho, let him/her know. Keep a watchful eye on it. Nervousness, anxiety is commom while on tx also.Wish I could be of more help, LL",

            "answer": "This is just my opinion -- but I think TX brings out genetic mutations in your system - and jumps you up on your timeline....For example - if you were to have Arthritis at age 55 ---- and you TX at 40 - you're going to have Arthritis at 40...Or whatever disease that is set to release at different times...To me - it seems like there is a string.... and there are knots on that string that signify timed events... And at certain knots - diseases/maladies/inherited sickness, diseases, etc. get turned on.I think the INF/Riba combo causes that to speed up and the knots happen much faster.It's a simplistic idea of my concept - but one that really seems to be true for some folks.For example - Diabetes seems to happen to a lot of folks --- Thyroidism --- hair loss, etc.It seems to me - that the Tx somehow ages your internal time clock - and perhaps ages you.And in aging you - things that you would normally have gotten at an older time - you will get now.So --- would it possibly excaberate a disease that was already going to happen? Yes.I think so.I also think that it's quite possible that the diseases that are genetically inherited may be processed much faster --- But I don't know if that means that if you are \"pre-programmed\" to get... say Diabetes --- if you will get rid of it much faster.I am also not sure if it will speed up or lengthen your life span...I'll let you know my thoughts on that after I kick the bucket.LOL!Hugs - hope you feel ok...And YES - do get a doctor to look at it - it could be something that is major --- such as brain impairment, etc. OK?Meki",

I don't tell my doctor though because I know those kinds of meds are not good for my liver & I do also have the AIH so I have to be on those meds & don't want to add to any problems.Jody",
