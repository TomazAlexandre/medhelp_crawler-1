            "answer": "Since you are eating a better diet, with fewer calories and less junk food and empty calories, your body is still using more calories than you are taking in.\u00a0\u00a0It is using all of what you are consuming and has no need to store any as fat.\u00a0\u00a0This is a good thing.\u00a0\u00a0The water is cleaning out the body of yucky unecessary storage and you are probably doing more even without the extra exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Don't borrow trouble.\u00a0\u00a0Weight loss that continues to the point you become underweight needs to be explored.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like your body is just \"adjusting\" to the new eating habits.",

    "question": "Hello, I am a married man of three years, have been with no\u00a0\u00a0one else but my wife for the last four years but have some concernes.\u00a0\u00a0February 21 had a phiysical and the Dr. told me I was very overweight and the Cholestorol was high.\u00a0\u00a0Before going for the physical I had some minor concerns and started diagnosing myself by reading a medical dictionary.\u00a0\u00a0Urine test and blood test all came back okay and I was told to lose some pounds.I started losing the weight by light excersise and eating right finally and the weight started coming off.\u00a0\u00a0I then stopped excersising but still eating right and drinking a lot of water and the weight is still coming off and it seems rather faster and I am concerned.\u00a0\u00a0I already diagnoised myself earlier with everything from cancer to hiv to diabetes because of some of symptoms I had.\u00a0\u00a0Losing weight without even trying (and in the past I could not lose weight if i tried), two nights of waking up with sweat on my head as well as the top of my night shirt being a little damp and just thinking that something was wrong (this was within a two month period).My dad has diabetes, but my tests came back negative for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Cancer does not run in the family. The wife had an hiv test five months ago for life insurance with negative results and my doctor told me that all my blood work came back fine.Should I get other tests done or am I just feeding into my fears that something is wrong for having access to too much info either by the medical dictionary and the internet and just worrying the weight away and stressing myself?",
