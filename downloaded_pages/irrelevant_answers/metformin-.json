            "answer": "Hi,An A1c of 5.0 is reasonable for a person with diabetes (considering non-diabetic levels are typical in the mid-4s).\u00a0\u00a0Great work!How was your diet and hba1c prior to adopting the diet and taking medication.Hba1c of 5.0 correlates to an average blood sugar of about 100.\u00a0\u00a0A non diabetic average blood sugar will be in the 80s.\u00a0\u00a0 Thus while you are doing well, yours levels are still slightly higher than optimal.Most likely the result of 5.0 is due to both diet and the metformin.Metformin is a safe drug.\u00a0\u00a0Suggest that you continue with both the drug and your diet, and continue to monitor hba1c.You can also use a home blood glucose meter to help you determine what foods work best for you and don't raise your blood sugars.",

    "question": "If a person is taking the lowest dose of Metformin, has changed their diet and a1c results are at 5.0, how do they know if the results are due to the drug or change in diet? Can they stop talking Metformin and continue controlling their blood sugar with diet alone?",
