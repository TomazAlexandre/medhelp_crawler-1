            "answer": "Hello,Without examination,it is difficult to confirm a diagnosis,but from your description it looks like a problem with the functioning of neurons.Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol?Such feeling of crawling under the skin are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due tovitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated.You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Common disorders causing such symptoms are brachial neuritis , transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.Treatment will depend on the diagnosis.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",
