            "answer": "Abilify is the least likely out of the current generation of anti-psychotics to cause weight gain and diabetes but it still can occur. As anti-psychotics can create diabetes and tardive dyskinesia if a person has straight bipolar (as opposed to bipolar with psychotic features where an anti-psychotic is absolutely needed) there is the potential to change to a mood stabilizer, none of which have the risk of creating tardive dyskinesia and out of all of them Lamictal has the least potential for weight gain and is generally safe and effective. Perhaps you could ask your psychiatrist about Lamictal.",

            "answer": "I have used Abilify for several years. I have not gained weight but lost it instead. I was started on Depakote though & did gain a signifcant amount of weight. But nothing compared to when they put me on Zyprexa. I had every side effect known while on it. I won't say how much weight, but it was considerable... They have put me on Abilify like I said for years, increasing the dose a lil' at a time, till I now take the maximum dose of 30 mg....",
