    "question": "Hi, I'm wondering if my symptoms sound indicative of hyper or hypoglycemia.About a year ago today, I came down with what felt like a stroke in my left side with sudden arm numbness, facial and leg tingling, and leg weakness paralysis. I was bedridden for months after with no diagnosis. On that day, I had eaten lots of carb type meals, little protein, was on my period, and had lots of candy type snacks.Almost a year later, I am better, but still suffer with the leg weakness and neck weakness and tingling and food chemical sensitivity. I am noticing that I get the following symptoms when I don't eat enough protein in my meals or have lots of sweet stuff:\u00a0\u00a0a feeling of being unfocused, anxiety, neck or head tingling, leg tingles, extreme fatigue, sometimes nausea (rarely), heavy eyelidscould this by Hyperglycemia or Diabetes...all my fasting, nonfasting glucose levels are normal, and so has the one that tests for average of several months.any advice..would appreciate",
