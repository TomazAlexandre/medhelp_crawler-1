            "answer": "There's a post by Gus who asked the same question yesterday. Diabetes medicine Metformin helps to produce insulin in the gut to \"help\" lower your glucose levels. It doesn't perform miracles nor does it lower your glucose levels by itself. The key word is \"help.\" Lifestyle change is required. This is done by controlling your glucose levels with proper nutrition, moderate exercise, and weight control. Read my posts in the threads from Darkestlight and Gus on this forum.",
