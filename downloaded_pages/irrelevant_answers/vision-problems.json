            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!What you had was halo vision. Well smoking, far sightedness, retinitis pigmentosa, air pollution, heavy alcohol consumption, cataract and glaucoma should also be looked into apart from diabetes. It can also be due to astigmatism that you have. Eye fatigue due to focusing for too long can also be the cause. If this repeats itself, consult your ophthalmologist. Take care!",
