            "answer": "Hello,Glimiperide and Actos have good data to show that they can bring down blood sugars, with a change in A1C of between 0.5-about 1.2% each, and with both you can have a greater effect. However they depend on your body having enough of its own insulin to work. In addition, some medications work better in some people than others. Also be sure that you have made changes in your diet to help improve success in bringing your sugars down.The natural course of diabetes is to need more medications as time goes on, so it may be that you need a different regimen at this time. If your sugars continue to be high, please speak to your doctor soon about starting a different regimen. Keep working on diet changes and exercise as well, this always helps a great deal.Take care.",
