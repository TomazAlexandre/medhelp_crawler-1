            "answer": "I used to do that long before pregnancy. Then I thought, as long as I'm healthy who cares about my weight... Same thing goes for now that I'm pregnant. I still exercise and weight train. And boy was it hard putting on that weight but it was muscle weight so I didn't mind back then and my weight remained constant since.I'm still early on on the pregnancy and lift a lil lighter since I get exhausted easily now. But anything I gain, I see as good for the baby. I've changed my habits as everything is done for the baby now no matter what haha. I want a strong healthy baby just like all of us here :)I'm happy that you aren't obsessing anymore. Some women can barely keep anything down in their pregnancies due to nausea. So every time I can eat without vomiting, and doing this or that without issue is a blessing.=)",
