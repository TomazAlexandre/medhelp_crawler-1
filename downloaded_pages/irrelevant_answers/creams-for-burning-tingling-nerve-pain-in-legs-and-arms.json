            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Paresthesias such as numbness and tingling may be attributed to a variety of conditions such as nerve injury, pressure on the nerves of the spine, Shingles,\u00a0\u00a0lack of blood supply,\u00a0\u00a0as well as underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, migraines, seizures, thyroid dysfunction, medication side effect as well as nutritional deficiencies. There are many creams available in the market that claims to help with the symptoms. However, additional studies may need to be done. Other neuropathy treatments in conjunction with prescription medications such as acupuncture or biofeedback therapy may also help. Take care and do keep us posted.",

It has also started to spread to the arms. Occassionally I also have mild pain in the testicles to go with the burning/tingling sensations. Would a natural probiotic yoghurt help these symptoms?I had an ultrasound of the testicles, the results didnt show anything.I tried Amitrpytyline for a week but it gave me dry mouth and poor sleeping patterns, so came off it.",

            "answer": "Sorry to hear that.Even though the tests showed up nothing, still go back and see the doctor if you keep getting these problems.When you get pain in the testicles this can be from a bacterial infection, orchitis; epididymo-orchitis if the epididmus is affected.\u00a0\u00a0These problems can also be connected to prostate problems.\u00a0\u00a0So don't just ignore it.Although the ultrasound showed nor abnormalities of the testicles, it would not have shown up a bacterial infection or prostate problem.Yogurt is cooling and anti-inflammatory so you can apply it to the area to see if give you any relief.\u00a0\u00a0Burning and tingling sensations on the external parts can be from a fungal infection, yogurt will help with this, but you need to have a swab taken to see if it is a fungal problem.Burning and tingling in the upper legs can also be from pressure on nerves in the groin or lower back, especially if you have arthritis.The arm problems can stem from pressure on nerves in the upper spine.I suggest you go back to your doctor with regard to your testicle pains as you may need a course of antibiotics.\u00a0\u00a0May be a good idea to get your prostate checked out and blood tests for any B12 deficiency etc.Also ask your doctor to refer you to Triage. They will be able to assess your leg and arm problems and you will then be referred for physiotherapy if Triage feels this would help.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "In the UK, Triage is the physiotherapy assessment team.You have to be referred to them by your doctor.When you are referred to them, you will get an appointment and they assess your problem to see who the right people are to treat your problem.\u00a0\u00a0They can refer you to specialists or different scans etc.Because you have tingling sensations in your arms and legs, this may be referred pain from the spinal column or trapped nerves, and the doctor would only refer you to Triage if he felt you would benefit.\u00a0\u00a0But it is worth asking.Also depends which part of the UK you are in.\u00a0\u00a0They may not have a Triage service in your area, but it is worth asking your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0If he gives you a funny look, then you'll know that you don't have a Triage service in your area, so just ask to be referred to physiotherapy to help with any trapped nerves that could be causing you the tingling sensations.If the Doxicycline did not work, then go back to your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0It may be that that particular antibiotic was not the right one, or you may need further doses.\u00a0\u00a0It is not very quick to clear up so don't neglect it.\u00a0\u00a0My husband was given Keflex (Cefalexin), but he had to have a few treatments before it finally settling down.Hope you get on OKBest wishes.",

            "answer": "Hi. So i got the testicles/scrotum tested and it came back all clear. No lumps, sign of psoriasis, bacterial/fungal infections. STD tests are normal. What do I try now?? I have tried Keflex, but it hasnt worked, which would explain why cos its an antibiotic, and there's no sign of infection.I am getting the burning, tingling and twitching all around my penis, scrotum, legs and arms throughout each day. I just cant seem to find the underlying cause? Neurologist said EMG and nerve conduction studies came back normal.Are there any treatments/creams you know of to help relieve the symptoms & the twitching?Also, what tests would you know recommend me to push with my doctor? I think it might be peripheral neuropathy from my ongoing problems with my testicles (maybe pudendal nerve inflammation?)Would appreciate your thoughts.Many thanks.",
