            "answer": "It could be you have a thyroid issue, the symptoms you noted are some thyroid symptoms that I have had, and iy is common for thyroid sufferers to have low Vitamin D, which in turn can also cause the muscle issues, Ask your Doctor tp perform a thyroid panel and insist on Free T4 Free T3 and TSH, once the results are in, request a copy of the lab results with the reference ranges for each. If your MD refuses to do these test for you then you need to find another MD, and if possible an Endocrinologist that treats thyroid and not just diabetes, If you cannot or are unable to find an MD due to insurance issues etc, there are independent labs that will do a thyroid panel for, from 90.00 to 140.00 dollars, You could also post your location and some members here may be able to give you some info on an MD that treats Thyroid in your area.\u00a0\u00a0Welcome to the forum and Good Luck FTB4",

    "question": "I was very active and athletic until about two years ago when, after going to the gym, I felt very tired. I had joint and muscle pain, head ach, digestive trouble with nausea. These symptoms were on and off, and I had to stop exercising for over a year now. I lost 30 pound. I felt tired all the time even without doing anything. My doctor believed it is due to stress, and I keep telling him that there is nothing stressing me other than my actual health. I have done multiple tests, MRI, fibroscope, colonoscopy, chest X-Ray, and a bunch of other blood work without any result. The only issue was a low vitamin D. I have also became very sensitive to cold, which is really weird because I am the type of guy that will never wear more than a shirt and a Jacket even when it is 20 below, and now I feel cold even when it\u2019s 10 above.\u00a0\u00a0Lately I have been trying to resume exercising, but every time I get a terrible night, with insomnia, muscle pain and feeling very cold to the point where I start shaking.If anyone has experienced something similar or has an idea I would appreciate the feedback.",
