Constipations can be due to life style causes like lack of adequate fiber in diet or due to inadequate drinking of fluids. Diabetes Mellitus and Hypothyroidism could cause the symptoms described by you. A simple blood test could help detect diabetes and hypothyroidism. Consult your primary care physician for these tests.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
