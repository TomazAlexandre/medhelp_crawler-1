    "question": "Dear HCVers,I was a chronic (very) active Hepatitis B patient. I say \"was\" because fortunately 2 weeks ago I am totally cured :)I am an under the treatment of Baraclude (a potent anti-viral treatment option for HBV) for 12 months.I write in your place (HCV community) because I think my diet and life style may also help you be cured from HCV.If natural supplements that I used are effective on HBV, why not on HCV, since HBV is more strenuous virus.See my results:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Hepatitis-B/My-All-Test-Result-After-12-Months-Treatment-of-Entecavir-I-am-cured/show/2355051See my story:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Hepatitis-B/Urgent-Advise-for-Entecavir-Usage/show/2044528Good luck...",
