            "answer": "I am in the same boat as well, but I normally have large babies for my size, all my babies are born over 9 pounds.I am 20w1d and I have been measuring about 2 weeks ahead of schedule. Now if you know your exact LMP(last mentrual period) date then I don't see why she would move your due date. If you are unsure when you concieved then she may move it to accomodate the size that your measuring.My doc and I are unsure about my due date because I was on Depo and hubby had a vesectomy when I got preggers, so the chances of my date moving are pretty good, Now if I knew my exact dates then the due date would be unlikely to change.A due date is just a guesstimation on when baby will arrive, less than 10% of babies are actually born on their actual given due dates.I also do not believe 100% that they can calculate a good birth weight with ultrasound, mainly because my youngest son Aiden was supposed to be 6lbs 7ounces at birth and he came out 9 pounds 6 ounces. When they measure your baby they look at the size of the head, femur, and tummy, but you may be having just a large baby in weight, but a short baby in length like I did.I wish you luck, and I wouldnt ask for induction, I would wait till baby comes on his/her own especially if your unsure of your dates.",

It just seems like she is so big and so heavy. I go for an u/s on tuesday the 3rd. So lets see what happends. Shoot I gained 10 1/2 lbs in 2 weeks. And I don't know how. I just think she is going to be really big.",

I hope they move it up. i remember going to an app when they said I was further along but they never changed my due date, so I guess my Dr's getting concerned because I'm huge and gaining all this weight, she wants to get the baby checked out and see whats going on. I also went in early with my son. Actually had him @ 35wks and he was 6lbs 7oz. So she just might be big! Who knows... LOL",

            "answer": "You're measuring really big for your current date. You dont have diabetes so that rules that out but then again as a last resort the doctor might see if he follows your new pattern to 40wks and then might ask to do an amnio to make sure the baby's lungs are developed and check it against the weight of the baby at that time and decide to induce unless you give birth on your own. I might be wrong but it's something you can ask to see if it's a possibility.",

Im 29wks so that would make me 31wks :-) but...My Ob is leaving me at the same due date though as they say the most accurate you can determine is from the very first ultrasound which for me is still at Aug 14. I wish he'd bring me forward then I might have him on my birthday which would be cool.... lol...I have seemed to have even been ahead/ infront with all of my pregnancy milestones (kicks etc) compared to what is the norm for that time in pregnancy so who knows??I do agree thou how can they completely tell. Even with me we were actively ttc and were ovulation tracking etc with charts and progesterone testing etc and according to my day21 prog blood test I didnt even ovulate nor did my temps show that I O'd - so who knows when I fell preggers?I do know though that from my understanding if baby is bigger than average they will not let you go much past your edd. so if you dont go early or on your edd at least you wont have to wait an extra 2weeks like some ladies do.I like to think of it too that my baby is already 'above average' even before entering the world - now isnt that a great way to start your life!!xx",

At 16 weeks i was measuring 18.5 weeks, at 22 weeks i was dead on 22 weeks and at 25weeks 4 days i was measuring 26 weeks 6 days.I have been told my EDD is 25/08/2008 but i was on the pill and didnt have any dates to go by (i dont get periods on the pill) so have no idea when im due. I think it might be a little bit earlier but we'l have to just wait and see.Midwife says that they always tend to keep the dates from your first scan as these have been proven to be the most accurate",
