            "answer": "Hi vegita.Ok, you must know the drill by now.Farxiga is only an adjunct to exercise and diet for blood sugar control.Which means, you must adhere to a strict exercise and diet program.Assuming you have mastered this, the next thing to rule out is very low blood pressure and I hope you know how to use a manual Sphygmomanometer (blood pressure monitor) which has to be used frequently every single day.In light of your symptoms you should also check your blood sugar levels more frequently.Do you adjust your dose, if needed, up to a max of 10mg ?There's a smaller possibility that your symptoms are not related toblood sugar control issues and could be due to an enterviral infection",
