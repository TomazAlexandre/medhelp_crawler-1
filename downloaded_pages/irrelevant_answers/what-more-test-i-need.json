            "answer": "Dr. Handsfield has already answered your question about HIV. The same is true for your questions about other STDs.\u00a0\u00a0You do not have HIV or other STDs an do not need more testing for them,\u00a0\u00a0If you are feeling poorly, you should discuss these concerns with an internal medicine specialist to look for other non-STD causes of your symptoms.Tingling is not a symptom of any STD. It is however a sign of anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes after an exposure that, in retrospect, one wishes they had not had, persons tend to examine themselves and be far more attuned to genital sensations than in periods when they are not concerned.\u00a0\u00a0This in turn leads to noticing what turn out to be normal sensations that might have been not noticed or ignored at other times.\u00a0\u00a0I suspect that this was a contributor to your situation.Similarly , most people with thrush do not have HIV. They have other problems such as diabetes or are at increased risk for thrush because of having taken antibiotics recently.\u00a0\u00a0EWH",
