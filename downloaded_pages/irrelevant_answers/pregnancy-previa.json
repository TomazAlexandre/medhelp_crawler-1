            "answer": "A lot of women (surprisingly) get previa. Yours really isn't severe I promise! Some women have their placenta completely lying on top of their cervix and with a few.weeks and sometimes months of pelvic rest they are able to give birth naturally. Just take it easy. From the sounds of it your doctor is not too worried about the previa since she hasn't put you on pelvic rest.",

            "answer": "Thank you! I get a lot of heavy pressure in my pelvic area and my doctor told me it's just the position of the baby and placenta. The baby literally has her face to her feet mashed into the placenta right now and she enjoys digging her toes into it. I was told take it easy, lay down and if I am sitting up to be leaned back a little at least to keep the pressure off of the placenta.. That went along with the loose fitting clothes. She just worried me when she told me she doesn't see them move most often! If, at my 26 weeks ultrasound, it hasn't moved and the baby still have swollen kidney's I will be put on bed rest in the hospital so I'm anticipating the results in a few more weeks. My first child was a boy and he was a breeze, they don't lie when they say girls are difficult apparently!! :) Thank you so much again for the response.",

            "answer": "The only complication I had with my boy was diabetes. Low blood sugar as well! It came back with her, of course. I delivered him naturally, no meds, no nothin! But he was born at 36 weeks. So on top expecting this one early (they're assuming) and now all this stuff I'm just like goodness. You're right, follow your brothers footsteps! Lol have you ever heard anything about the babies kidney's being swollen? My doc said she was a little concerned but she wasn't a loud to jump to conclusions because it could've been something as simple as she had to pee at the time and just wouldn't.. Saving the next look at her kidney's for the 26 weeks mark with the placenta. I didn't know that could happen while they were still bakin in the belly!",

    "question": "I'm pushing 22 weeks with my second child and at my 20 weeks ultrasound my doctor found baby girls kidney's swollen AND my placenta is a little less than half an inch from the opening to my cervix as well as directly behind my belly button. The only restrictions I was given are not to wear any clothing other than loose fitting because it can cut off circulation and to watch for spotting or bleeding. I will have a 26 weeks check up to look at the baby's kidney's and to see if the placenta moved up at all. My doctor said she prefers if not normal (top of the uterus) than at least have the placenta at 4 inches from the cervix.. And that she will still allow me to deliver normally if my placenta moves up at least 2 inches.Has anyone ever had this? What are the odds of it moving? When I asked my doctor she said when she sees it a few woman have theirs move but more often they do not. I'm really just looking for some information. It seems like a lot of doctors have different opinions from what I've looked up... Any info would help! Thanks.",
