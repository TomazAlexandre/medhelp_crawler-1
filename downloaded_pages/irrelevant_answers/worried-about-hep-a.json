            "answer": "Hi, the possibility is there. Hepatitis A is transmitted by the feco oral route, means it is transmitted by contamination of food with fecal matter from the infected person. Symptoms will usually show up 2 - 6 weeks after being exposed to the hepatitis A virus. They are usually mild, but may last for up to several months. It is usually self limiting.
