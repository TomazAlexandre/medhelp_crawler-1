            "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about the negligence of the nursing staff. Talk about stupidity! Not examining medical equipment before its put onto a patient's face is uncalled for. I hope you're in contact with the best malpractice lawyer in your area. Someone needs to pay for your pain and suffering.Try posting on the sister forum, \"Ask a Doctor\". Dr Ramsetty, an Endocronologist, may be able to point you in the right direction. Copy your thread and post also in Neurology, Gastroenterolgy, and, specifically Undiagnosed Symptoms. Be sure to mention the types of doctors seen for the Cidex accident and what, if any, they have done. Good luck to you and I do hope your body returns to a normal state.",

            "answer": "I want to thank you for your time and caring I was just about to the point to think that It is like having the PLAUGE or some thing. I have had 2 -diff Dr.s look down my throat after 3 months of trying to get to see one . With the cameras and the first said that my larnyx was blood red and there were blisters around my traceha and my throat was still swolen and iritated\u00a0\u00a0but he thought that mabey i was having silent reflux? and that was probably why it hadn't healed. the second one said he never heard of such a thing as getting cidex in your system, but that my throat was still red and swollen (this one after 4 months) then i get to have a bronchospocty?--- and he said i had scaring in my lungs and that part of my epiglottis--- had been damadged . (burnt away) the only thing is all of the Dr.s all practice at the Hospital that this happened at and my pcp does also -the only thing they have done is give me some Advair samples and nasal cort spray and prilosec. (mabey there is nothing else they can do ) but it's like hanging you off of a cliff and them turning their backs and saying -you hear some thing I don't hear anything do you?.naw lets go home ...I know your tired of me by now but I do want to thank you very much.",

            "answer": "Seeing doctors at the same hospital where the accident occurred is not a good idea. Not saying its totally wrong but they ALL work for the same employer, the hospital. And there is a \"good ole boy\" network where one person backs the other person and no one does anything. On top of that to treat you only with Advair samples, cort spray, and prilosec is a red flag that these doctors have ZERO knowledge on how to resolve your medical crisis. To take a back seat approach of let's see if it get's worse then we'll try something else, or let's see if is goes away by itself is shoddy medicine, if not inhuman. {Medicine is the art and science of healing. It encompasses a range of health care practices.} It appears they are taking the word \"practice\" literally, or in your case no-practice.RUN as fast as you can away from these lunatics to a major teaching hospital. These are usually found next to or near a major college university and where the experts reside. To find one follow this linkhttp://www.optn.org/latestData/stateData.asp?type=state , click on your state, select any category and All for organ, then any transplant field. In the next field select any organ and below that use the scroll arrow button and select Transplant Center. I know you're not going for a transplant but the list will display all major teaching hospitals for your state and area. Select one and go to their Emergency Center immediately.",
