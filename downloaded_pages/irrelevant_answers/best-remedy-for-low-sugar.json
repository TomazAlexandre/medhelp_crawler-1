    "question": "Over the past six or seven months I have been experiencing some wicked low blood sugars (48, 55, 60) Mostly overnight, some times during the day. I've had type ii for 10 years and this kind of problem was rare. What is the best rapid response to this. If I drink juice or take candy or jelly to fix the immediate problem my morning sugars are outrageous. Regular food takes too long to stop the decline. I'm allergic to peanuts, corn and soybeans so my nighttime snacking options are limited. Any advice?",
