            "answer": "Well you aren't eating or really taking care of yourself, so no that is not normal.\u00a0\u00a0I have seen it when people lose weight by not eating only 1 time a day, and others actually gain.\u00a0\u00a0So, it happens, but it is in no way healthy and as a word of caution... you are very likely to gain 2 times what you have lost when you do start eating.\u00a0\u00a0You are currently losing muscle = by not eating your body goes into \"starvation mode\" and is burning muscle, not fat.\u00a0\u00a0It is much healthier to eat throughout the day than what you are doing.",

    "question": "Greetings!In the last four days, I have lost roughly 8 lbs. Some of you may think I am gloating, but I am just curious. A little background information first. I am a 6 foot, 18 y.o. male with no history of HIV exposure or any other medical conditions.During the school year I would eat 3 squares a day, including a snack twice a day. I played rugby (which is a great way to lose weight and gain girlfriends!) and tried to watch my weight. I weighed rougly 220 at the beginning of the season, and was down to a lean 207 after my final match. After the season had ended, I took on two jobs. My first job is the most active, its all manual labour. My second job is delivering chinese food. I work 14+ hours a day, with 7-8 of those hours being heavy lifting and just general being physical.In the last week, due to time constraints, I've made some lifestyle changes. I only eat 2 meals a day, and most days of the week I only ate one. I usually get less than 7 hours of sleep a night, but I do stay very hydrated during the day as well as taking a multi-vitamin. I have pretty good energy during the day with a ravenous apetite that I slake with plenty of food (none of it being healthy, usually its Chinese food from my resturant or on occasion fast food) at lunch time. Four days ago and I weighed 205 lbs. I woke up today and weighed 198 lbs. My girlfriend says I'm wasting away and even my dense little brother noticed I'm slimming down.I swear I'm not here to gloat! I am wondering, is this normal?",
