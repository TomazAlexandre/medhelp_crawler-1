            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!There is a possibility that these symptoms are due to varicose veins or due to deep vein thrombosis. A color Doppler will help reach a diagnosis. Other possibilities are diabetes and hypothyroidism.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please discuss this with your doctor and get yourself investigated accordingly. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

Based on fact that pain is simulataneously symmetric left/right, both arms/legs, and there's no swelling, discoloration, or tenderness (see characteristics list above), the four (4) physicians I have consulted have chosen not to check me for dvt. Will continue consulting physician for hypothyroid (Armour, etc.) into '09 and see what develops.",
