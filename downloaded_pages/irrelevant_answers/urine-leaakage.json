            "answer": "Hello,Feeling of incomplete voiding can occur due to infection, diabetes, tumors in the bladder or prostrate, STD, excess intake of fluid, pregnancy, use of diuretics, stones in the urinary tract etc.Reduced bladder capacity, masses in the bladder can also cause increased frequency and incomplete voiding.I would suggest that you repeat a urine analysis with culture and cystometry with cystoscopy done. I sincerely advise you to consult a urologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made.Treatment will depend on the same.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.Kind regards.",
