            "answer": "Hello,Statin drugs are known to have a side effect of raising blood sugars / inducing diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0They also have many other side effects.\u00a0\u00a0If you do take them, please make sure you also take a CoQ10 supplement, as they deplete your body's CoQ10 (which is critical for cardiac health).It would be better if you can manage your cholesterol though dietary measures.\u00a0\u00a0Against what one would think as common sense a low carb diet (high fat, moderate protein), along with regular and intense exercise, can effectively reduce cholesterol. A regular glass of red wine (remember moderation) may also help.Fats should be natural sources under such a diet (ie. olive oil, coconut oils, cold pressed nut oils, unprocessed dairy), and avoid transfats (manmade and processed fats), strictly limit fructose from all sources (particularly high fructose corn syrup - but also limit fruits).\u00a0\u00a0Carbs should come from plenty of non-starchy vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0Avoid processed foods.Hope this can help.",

    "question": "Does anyone know if the medicine Pravastatin (for high cholesterol) can cause your sugar to go up? I had quit taking it for about 2 weeks and my sugar which is usually high came down to 90-120, when I started taking it again my sugar went back up to 180-230.",
