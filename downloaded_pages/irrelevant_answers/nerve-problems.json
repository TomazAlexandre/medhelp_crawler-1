            "answer": "Hi,I would suggest you to get tested for peripheral neuropathy. It can be caused by conditions like diabetes, vitamin B 12 deficiencies and thyroid dysfunction. These symptoms could also be due to anxiety, stress and fatigue. Neurologica lesions also cannot be ruled out.It is good that you have taken an appointment with a neurologist. I would suggest you to take B complex vitamins and see if your symptoms get any better.Take care!",

    "question": "Hi all,Wondering if someone could help - I have been to my GP and have been referred to a neurologist - 2 month wait.The symptoms are changing, and I would like some advise as to what this could be:1) Started a month ago - acute brachial plexus pain in left shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0Very painful.\u00a0\u00a0After 2-3 days the pain died off a bit was still present for about 3 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0 This pain was only when the shoulder was moved backward or when I applied pressure to a certain spot in the shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0This was accompanied by a tingling in the left thumb.2) After this pain dissapeared the tingling remained only\u00a0\u00a0lightly for a week or so.\u00a0\u00a0I then got a tingle in my left big toe.\u00a0\u00a0Not as bad. Possibly unrelated as I pulled a lower back muscle a day or two before the toe tingling started.3)\u00a0\u00a0My left forearm feels a little weak and so does my finger movement on that hand.4) The toe tingling is still there a little bit.5) I had a neck x-ray and CT Scan which didn't show any abnormalities.Any ideas?\u00a0\u00a0The weakness in left arm seems to be getting worse.",
