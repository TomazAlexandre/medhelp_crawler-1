            "answer": "Thank you very much for your response. I met with a second doctor, and he, too, reported that I have a cataract. I asked him why the vision impairment occurred around the same time as the other symptoms, and he was of the opinion that the other issues just brought to my attention the vision loss. I am still not convinced, as the first issue was the vision impairment.",

            "answer": "Having two physicians tell you you have a cataract means it is likely there. Sometimes the awareness of a problem that comes on slowly becomes suddenly aware to a person. For instance when people have a problem or eye injury they often pay more attention to their vision and check each eye separatelIf you have not family history of cataract and you are 27 then you should see your personal physician for testing to see if there are any underlying diseases that might cause cataracts at a young age. This would include ruling out diabetes, kidney diseases, high blood calcium.\u00a0\u00a0Also heavy smoking and drinking can cause cataracts at a young age.JCH MD",

    "question": "I began experiencing cloudy and somewhat blurry vision in my left eye one afternoon, while on my computer. I attributed it to eye fatigue. However, that night, I woke up with discharge and eye crusting, as well as the sensation that I can \"feel\" my eye. The following day, I met with an ophthalmologist, who initially suggested I have dry eyes, but, as an almost afterthought, decided to dilate my\u00a0\u00a0pupils. He stated that I have a cataract in my left eye, \"in the back.\" I'm confused about the link between the cataract and the watery discharge and crusting of my eye. When he changed his diagnosis, he seemed to ignore that the vision occurred just hours before the discharge, crusting, and sensation of feeling my eye. (For the record, I have been using the artificial tears he initially recommended, and my symptoms have not improved.) Any thoughts would be welcome.",
