    "question": "I went to the doctor today and I measured 33+4 and I'm currently 31+5. My doctor is giving me an ultrasound tomorrow to check if the baby is really that big or is he just positioned in a way to make me measure further than what I am. Have any one else experienced this? I don't have diabetes so that's out of the question. All I want to know is what would cause him to be so big.",
