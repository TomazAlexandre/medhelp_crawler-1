    "question": "Well I am being induced tomorrow! I have gestational diabetes, so to prevent the baby from getting too huge like Jameson was, my midwife wants me to deliver early. Jameson was 10:6 and broke his collarbone being born because of his size. He also had several other problems caused by my gestational diabetes.Its only 5 days before my due date though, so I hope it even makes a difference.My left hip is SO out of socket. I can barely walk and every step is painful. Which is tough because I have SO much to do today! I need to get my laundry all caught up and get food for the kids and make lists and clean the house. Good thing its summer and all the kids are home to help. :)I will post as soon as I can and let you all know the stats---gender, weight, etc.!!!!!!!!!!!!!Cross your fingers for me that everything goes smoothely. :)",
