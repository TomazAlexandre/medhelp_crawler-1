            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Your symptoms are very suggestive of peripheral neuropathy. Pins and needles sensation and burning pain are classical features of peripheral neuropathy. This can occur due to diabetes or due to B12 deficiency.Have you been screened for diabetes?If diabetes has been excluded, the other possibility that needs to be ruled out is B12 deficiency. I would suggest you to take OTC B12 supplements till you are able to see your neurologist.Hope this helps!",

            "answer": "Well today the pins and needles seem to be spreading, I can now feel it all the way up my arm to my shoulder and up to my knees in my legs. The aches and pains - like toothache in my shoulder, arms and fingertips are really bad today too. OTC painkillers haven't worked for it before and I am getting concerned. I will see my GP tomorrow and let him know all about this but I was wondering if it still sounds like peripheral neuropathy. I just hate the fact it is getting worse. The pins and needles are not very intense but extremely annoying and uncomfortable. I also feel unwell with it, cannot describe how though. I am very tired too and get quite dizzy when things are really bad.",

My personal experience is that with neuropathic pain (if that is problem) that the NSAIDS are not effective.\u00a0\u00a0I usually try to keep my skin cool to bring relief but not so cold to induce numbness. My feet get particularly hot and I direct a fan towards them and use aloe vera, that helps somewhat.",

            "answer": "It is the cold that is affecting me the most. I am in a jumper with a hot water bottle under lots of blankets, no matter what the weather I can be like this, then when I start to get too hot I feel dizzy and sick. But...the heat is not due to all these blankets as sometimes I will be warm enough anyway and walk round the house in underwear. I cannot seem to get a happy medium and the extremes seem to make how I feel, a lot worse.",

    "question": "Hi all, I was hoping you could maybe help me.It all started 6 months ago with pain in my right hand. Then I started to get a strange sensation in my 4th and 5th fingers, that has since gone. Then the pins and needles started, then both hands and now feet too. My shins also get very tingly, to the point where it feels like someone is pulling the hairs out with tweezers. I have seen my doctor, been to orthopedics and now I have been referred to neurology. The neurologist will be doing a nerve conduction study. I have about a 2 week wait an am starting to get a little worried as it is getting worse. I am 23 years old and I was wondering if anyone else has had similar problems and ideas on what this could be. Thank you for your time. (I live in the UK too if that help in any way)",
