            "answer": "How did you come to the diagnosis of DI? My little girl is almost 2 and she drinks more than she eats, urinates often and a lot. I am worried about DI because it is in our family. She could drink up to a 1/2 gallon of milk a day if I allowed her to! She also drinks water on top of that.",

            "answer": "Hi there! I noticed that around when my daughter was 4 months she used to wet through her sleep suits and nappy and bed sheets at night and every night. She has always drunk alot and her urine looks like water and has no yellow pigment to it at all. She was under a consultant anyway and when she had a check up in November last year. I mentioned that she is always drinking and that she goes through at least 5 nappies a night, not to mention what she was going through in the day! He said that it could just be habit, but he will send her for first morning urine test and blood at the same time to check for a rare condition which is DI. It so happened that she did have it and is now on medication. I suggest that you take your daughter to the doctors and ask them about it. Its important you check to make sure! It could even be the normal diabetes if she drinks alot to so best get it checked out just in case! let me know how you get on!!!Jules",

            "answer": "I wouldn't let her drink as she pleases, as her body isn't sending the right signals for what she really needs. You should call up her doctor and tell him about the symptoms she is having and they can go over with you the best new treatment for her. Good luck.",

    "question": "Hi my 2 year old daughter has diabetes insipidus and is on the Desmospray. two sprays in morning and two at night. This weekend her stools are really loose and have become just water now. I am worried but she seems to be ok in herself. She is also restricted to 1 litre in 24 hours because she suffers also with excessive drinking of water. Do i let her have more to drink while she has loose stools and keep her on the desmospray or should i stop it while she is loose and give her what she wants to drink. I dont want her to become really poorly!",
