            "answer": "Hi.It would be helpful if you gave additional information such as any medications you are currently taking, your exercise habits, or any other medical conditions. There could be many causes of leg jerks. Dehydration and lack of potassium and magnesium can sometimes cause leg cramps or spasms.Putting that aside, your symptoms can also suggest the presence of restless legs syndrome. Although the definitive cause of RLS is unknown in most patientsm, there are reports that associate it with obesity, smoking, iron deficiency and anemia, nerve disease, polyneuropathy associated with hypothyroidism, heavy metal toxicity, diabetes, and kidney failure secondary to vitamin and mineral deficiency, as well as some medications.Treatment of RLS would be targeted at managing the underlying condition, if present. You should talk to your physician about the possibility of having RLS and to properly manage your condition.Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Thank you very much for getting back to me so soon.No medications. I am a nurse so I am on my feet all day, usually work about 10+ hours a day x four days a week. No regular exercise routine, but in fairly good shape. I am a male, 41 years old,\u00a0\u00a05' 5\" and weigh 134 lbs.In 2005, I had to have a colon resection due to diverticulitis, while in the hospital I had problems with my potassium being low at times and had to have IV potassium 2 or 3 times. But since then I am unaware of it being low again.No smoking, no alcohol. Mom had diabetes and sister had gestational diabetes x 2 births, and currently has hypothyroidism, being treated with Thyrolar.MS, Parkinson's, Wilson's disease, Huntington's have all been ruled out.RLS was discussed but because when my leg jumps/jerks it does so about a foot off the ground. For example, I will be sitting in a chair, with legs bent, and my leg will hit the underside of a table.My question about RLS, does it only happen at night? When this first began it did it all day and all night, but now it seems to settle down at night. Also, when this all started it was a constant jumping day and night, the doctor prescribed Flexeril until I could get into another doctor. Flexeril did help the jumping but the tugging sensation is still there as if it wants or is trying to jump, but can't. The sensation has now moved to my right leg also and have the same type of sensations at times in my arms, but only the left leg is jumping.Thanks in advance for any help you can give me.Have a great day!",

    "question": "For about three months now my left leg has been jumping; not a tremor, kind of like a jerking/involuntary movement. I am unable to control this movement. Toes do not draw up or my feet are not effected. Sometimes the jumping will last all day and some days it will not do it a all. Sometimes it will only jump once or twice a day. When my leg is not jumping, it is painful. Yesterday, my right leg started feeling like it wanted to jump or like there was pressure on it. Never jumped though.I have had a brain MRI, c-spine MRI, lumbar MRI, and sleep deprived EEG--all are normal. Blood work is all OK. I am currently waiting on results from a Lyme test. But I still don't have a diagnosis. Please help! I have research everything I know and I can't find anything like this. Just point in the right direction. Thanks a bunch.",
