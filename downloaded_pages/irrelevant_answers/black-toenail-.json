    "question": "I am a 37 year old type 1 diabetic. I have been a diabetic for 8 years now. My A1C has averaged around a 9 to a 10 for the most part. For the past 4 months I have experienced severe pain in my calf, thigh and feet. I have also had a throbbing ache and sting through out my whole body. About a week ago both of my big toes felt raw to the touch at the toe nail and now my right big toe nail has turned black and is sore. My vision has been getting blurry when i read. I also have a history of Afib. What could this be?",
