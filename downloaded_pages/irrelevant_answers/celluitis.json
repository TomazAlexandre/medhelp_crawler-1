            "answer": "Gosh, I hope things worked out OK for you.\u00a0\u00a0Cellulitis is nothing to mess with, especially if you have diabetes or any other reason to be immunocompromised.\u00a0\u00a0A few years ago there was more press about 'flesh eating bacteria';\u00a0\u00a0there are fewer stories in the papers nowadays, but the 'bug' still exists and can do great harm, even be fatal in some cases.\u00a0\u00a0In cases as you describe, you simply need an antibiotic-- and as quickly as possible.\u00a0\u00a0It is too late for this situation, I realize, but for others-- if you are in this type of situation and cannot get the medication, and you can actually see the spread of redness, heat, or other signs of infection, get to the emergency room and demand treatment.\u00a0\u00a0I dose of IV antibiotics would be appropriate in such a case.",

    "question": "A week or so ago my upper arm right below my sholder on the back side swelled up and it was hot.I took a bactrim and it went away.Now it came back but alot bigger.I went to the ER and they told me I had celluitis and they gave me an antibiotic,but the pharmacy was closed so I couldn't get it tonight.I was already having pain in my arm it was a sort of intense tingleing in my arm going all the way down to my hand and fingers.I went to bed and woke up an hour or so later and my arm was throbbing.I don't have any pain pills and when I went to the ER they gave me a paper that told me to get a lot of rest,put a warm moist compress on it and elevate it so when I woke up I went to the bathroom and put a warm washcloth on it and it didn't help.I have been washing it out with antibacteral soap and warm water and nothing seems to help.I was wanting to know if you had any advice and I wanted to know if it was normal to have this sever of pain.",
