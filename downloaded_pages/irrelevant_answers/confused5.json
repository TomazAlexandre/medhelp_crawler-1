            "answer": "i think its absolutely fine many babies estimated weight is between 6lb-8lb which is pretty normal honestly.. usually with growth restriction they tend to induce women early especially if they have gtt.. if by 38wks baby is 7lb i think thats fantastic weight.. may be baby length is small but i dont think his weight has anything to do with it.. what have your doctors told u so far?",

    "question": "Okay so two weeks ago I was told my baby had a growth restriction because my fundal height is four weeks behind and she measured two weeks behind on ultrasound which was very scary considering I have gestational diabetes this morning I went for another ultrasound and my baby's estimated weight is 7.0 pounds. I know that can be off by around a pound either way but I don't think that sounds horrible considering I was only 5'1 and 106 pounds before pregnancy. I'm a very small woman. I kinda feel like a weight is lifted off my shoulders to be honest I mean she must be growing right?\u00a0\u00a0My question is tho why is my fundal height off by four weeks but baby doesn't seem THAT small by ultrasound when you figure in my body type??",
