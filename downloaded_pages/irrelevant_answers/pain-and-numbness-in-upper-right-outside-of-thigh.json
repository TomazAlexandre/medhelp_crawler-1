            "answer": "Hello,I have been dealing with the following symptoms. They are as follows, numbness,tingling,itching and burning from above knee to the hip joint.\u00a0\u00a0 This seems to be moving toward my left upper thigh\u00a0\u00a0, but not as prevalent. This has been with me since 1997. They keep telling me it is a inoperable and I should just deal with the pain. This numbness seems to extend to my little toes at time. I was diagnosed with borderline diabetes , but I had this way before I was diagnosed. Any help is greatly appreciated,.",

            "answer": "I have the same problem but in my case I'm a diabetic and my diabetes is being blamed but I'm not so sure about that.\u00a0\u00a0Last year one of my verterbrae was pushed out of alignment (although I didn't know it at the time) and my doctor immediately ordered an x-ray and highlighted the problem.My doctor, who is not as conservative as some other doctors, referred me to a chiropractor.\u00a0\u00a0Up to that point in time I was very much against seeing a chiropractor. He corrected the problem in two visits.\u00a0\u00a0Now I will quite happily consult them for skeletal problems. I have booked an appointment with him again because my research indicates it could be a pinched nerve or my verterbrae has gone out of alignment again.The first doctor I saw at the emergency ward wanted to prescribe Tylenol 4.\u00a0\u00a0Some doctor!Perhaps you should consult a chiropractor who may be able to help you.",

I am now as of today being sent back for a follow up MRI and prescribed a anti-inflammatory by the name of \"Methylprednisolone \" this is 6 day dosage and is suppose to help relieve the swelling. This is to be seen. I was also informed today I was not a diabetic. The other doctor took that the medication, I was on was for treating diabetes, but actually was for treating another ailment I have.\u00a0\u00a0Who knows what will be next.",
