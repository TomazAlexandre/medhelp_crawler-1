            "answer": "Hi,How are you?Your symptomatology does not sound like you are having MS.There are definitive guidelines, on which the diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis is based. There are definitive lesions (suggestive of MS) on MRI also.Once internationally accepted criteria\u2019s are satisfied, then diagnosis of multiple Sclerosis can be made.Follow the instruction of your neurologist.Alternatively, Hyperthyroidism can also cause muscles twitching.Anxiety and nervousness can also similar symptoms.Wait for the MRI report to come.If any annoying symptoms develop, then re-evaluation is needed for your cause.Hope this helps you.Bye.",

            "answer": "Hi,You dont have other symptoms of MS like diplopia, balance problems, speech problems, bladder and bowel problems so it does not look like multiple sclerosis but MRI report will be diagnostic. So you will have to wait for that. There is a good possibility of BFS since you have constant twitching but i would suggest you to get a blood sugar test to rule out diabetes as you pins and needles sensation in your extremities which can occur due to high blood sugar. Please try to relax and cut down on your stress levels as anxiety and constant stress is one of the precipitating factor for BFS.Good luck!",

            "answer": "Hi,I don't think your bladder problem is related to MS. Urinary incontinence is commonly seen bladder problem in patients with MS and you say you dont leak urine so i think it is not related.Please dont get worked up and try to relax i know it is easier said than done but do try to relax.",

    "question": "Should I be worried??\u00a0\u00a0I have seen 2 Neurologists but don't seem to get a straight answer.My symptoms over the last 3 mnths are as follows:-Slight buzzing/pins and needles in left foot which would come and go for about 3 days.\u00a0\u00a0Has gone now but feel slight crampy feeling in toes.Constant widespread muscle twitching, worse in calves and feet.Small tingly buzzy feelings on off in feet hands and even scalp and face.Now I have a buzzy/vibration feeling in feet and a little up the calves.I have a Neuro exam which was fine apart from slight brisk reflexes which would put down do anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0I will be having an MRI on Tues and I'm so worried they'll find MS.\u00a0\u00a0My neuro said the symptoms would be constant and wouldn't come an go but I've since heard they can come and go during the day.Does this sound like MS? Or could it be benign like BFS?\u00a0\u00a0I have severe anxiety and stress, could it be that?\u00a0\u00a0I also have a slight over active thyroid, not by much but it is over.",
