Lichter, dean of the Medical School, said in an interview. \" 'Why not create a center whose goal is to cure this disease, or at least advance us closer to the day when the disease will be eradicated?' \"The money will be used to build the $30 million Brehm Center for Type 1 Diabetes Research, create a Michigan Comprehensive Diabetes Center to coordinate all the university's research activity on Type 1 diabetes and hire eight faculty members. It will be, Bill Brehm said, \"a multifaceted, frontal assault\" on the disease that has afflicted his wife for decades.",
