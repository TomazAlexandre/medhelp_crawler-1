    "question": "I have been taking Atenolol for approx 10 yrs now for an irregular heart rhythm as well as General Anxiety Disorder. i also have MVP and the Atenolol has really worked quite well in keeping my symptoms in check.\u00a0\u00a0I started on 25 mg of Atenolol and in Dec. 2008 my Dr. increased it to 50 mgs as I had a couple of episodes of tacchycardia. Since the increase in meds,\u00a0\u00a0I have put on approx 15-20 lbs despite being active (recently increased to 30-40 mins of cardio/day).\u00a0\u00a0I know the extra weight cannot be healthy (i'm 6'0, 260 lbs) but I cannot take the weight off.\u00a0\u00a0Should I consider having my dr. cut me back to 25 mgs to see if the weight will come off?\u00a0\u00a0i also have a family hx of diabetes and was told that i was \"borderline Type II\" at my last checkup.\u00a0\u00a0Please help!",
