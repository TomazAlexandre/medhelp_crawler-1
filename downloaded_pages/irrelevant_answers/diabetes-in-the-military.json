            "answer": "Dear Sir,You can very well expect to\u00a0\u00a0be discharged from the military for type 1 diabetes. i was 31 years ago. The reasoning was that they didn't think they could guarantee getting you insulin and other diabetic suppilies during a wartime situation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You will get excellent care from the VA after your discharge. i have the greatest rspect for the help i've received, though i read a lot of books and papers i get from the National Institute of Health, www.NIH.gov. But i do recommrnd you seek medical help as soon a possible or else it can only get worse. In the VA system i'm one of the few type 1 diabetics and on a insulin pump, which is kind of a rare thing in the VA. Good luck and i hope you get the professional care i've received from them. Good luck, bret",
