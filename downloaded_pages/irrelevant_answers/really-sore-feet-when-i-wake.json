            "answer": "You will want to rule out poor blood circulation and also peripheral neuropathy.Have you ever had a lipid panel done to see if you have elevated cholesterol?\u00a0\u00a0If it is high, you might talk to your doctor not only about how to lower it, but mention your pain and see about getting the doppler testing of your lower extremities to check out your circulation.Since it happens when you lay down, you might also want to take a home blood pressure cuff and see if your blood pressure in general is very low in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0Also, you might make sure if you have circulation issues, that your ferritin (iron stores) are in normal range and you are not iron deficient, which can affect oxygenation of tissues.Have you ever had an EMG with testing of nerve conduction in your lower extremities?\u00a0\u00a0Have you had your blood sugar checked before to make sure you don't have diabetes (peripheral neuropathy can happen with diabetes)?",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Pain or soreness in the foot, that eases with time during the day, is generally indicative of plantar fasciitis. The first step you take generally after sitting or standing for a long time or when you get up from the bed is painful. As you start walking the pain clears up. Plantar fascia is a ligament that connects your heel bone to your toes. If it swells, becomes weak or inflamed, it causes these symptoms. After some time, you may feel pain always. The other possibility is osteoarthritis. This also causes pain worse after inactivity\u2014the first few steps always painful.\u00a0\u00a0Please consult an orthopedic specialist regarding this.If possible consult a sports injury center. This is equipped with treatment options for plantar fasciitis. There are various things you can try such as especially designed insoles, night splints and wraps. Besides this there are various massage therapies, stretch exercises, and pressure point stimulation by trained specialists.Burning sensation in the soles can be due to plantar fasciitis, diabetes, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, peripheral neuropathies, hypothyroidism, SLE, alcoholism, peripheral artery disease, sciatica, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis and high blood pressure. You will need blood tests, nerve conduction studies and dopplar studies to reach a diagnosis.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history",
