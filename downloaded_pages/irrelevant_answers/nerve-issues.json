            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.I doubt that some spinal nerves may be compressing in spine after the injury. By the reason of that nerves from the spinal cord can be irritated causing weakness in the extremities, twitching and numbness, tingling. Additionally, neuropathy (due to vitamin deficiency, diabetes, alcohol) needs to be thoroughly evaluated with a neurologist. If you suffer continuous weakness and notice reduced strength of muscle bulk in muscles, please arrange an appointment with a neurologist right away who will evaluate the possibilities here. These \u201cred flags\u201d could be indicative of compression of the spinal cord and its nerve branches and early treatment is essential if permanent damage needs to be avoided. Further referral to a physiotherapist for spinal exercises could be beneficial and may produce relief of symptoms. Hope this helps. Take Care & Stay Healthy!!!",

    "question": "I'm a 24 yr old male, I weigh 145ish, and in generally good health. I've been feeling fatigued, I have weak arms and legs. Sometimes my fingers shake, like the muscle is weak or over-worked. My eyelids constantly twitch and sometimes my chin area has these twitches too. I feel a bit off-balance at times and dizzy--minor. I did pull something in my back before, do you think this can be the cause? I have a hard time sitting up straight. Maybe I should tell my doc to refer me to a neurologist...What is your feedback? I was diagnosed with a hernia and swollen lymph nodes, by way of a CAT scan...but I don't think its connected.",
