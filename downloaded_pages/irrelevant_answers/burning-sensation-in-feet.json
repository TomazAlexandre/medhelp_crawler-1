            "answer": "Hi,How are you?Diabetes is by far the most common cause of burning feet but it cannot be considered since it has been ruled out in your case.Other possibilities that can be considered are tarsal tunnel syndrome which causes nerve compression in the foot, B12 deficiency which can also cause peripheral neuropathy, chronic alcoholism and low platelets are other causes of burning feet.I would suggest you to get yourself examined by your PCP and discuss these possibilities. Take care!",

    "question": "I have been experiencing a burning, painfull sensation in the bottom of my feet.\u00a0\u00a0I am not a diabetic nor have I sustained any injuries to my feet.\u00a0\u00a0The pain/burning will last anywhere from approximately five minutes to one hour.\u00a0\u00a0There are no precipitating factors that seem to lead to the sensation.\u00a0\u00a0When they first started, they seemed to be very sporadic but now seem to be occurring with more frequency.Thanks,Mary",
