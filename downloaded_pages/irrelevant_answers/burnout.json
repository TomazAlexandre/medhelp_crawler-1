It frustrates my sister and me. We try to remind her of the complications, of which she has had 2 mild strokes and a heart attack; we also remind her that she now has 2 grandchildren.\u00a0\u00a0These scare tactics usually work.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately you cannot MAKE people take care of diabetes they have to want to.\u00a0\u00a0I am told that teenagers go thru cycles of not caring for their diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully this is only a phase.my daughter is stilla t the age where she listens to me.\u00a0\u00a0good luck .",

            "answer": "Hi there,Yes it's very difficult to watch your son go through this but I will tell you I went through the very same thing when I was a teen.\u00a0\u00a0At 18 I was admitted into the hospital with Keytone Acidosis.\u00a0\u00a0Luckily I don't go into a coma when I have high's and low's but some people do.\u00a0\u00a0But let me tell you his state of mind. I have been a diabetic since I was 5 years old and am now 36. For most of my life I have been looking for ways so that the diabetes does not control me but I control it. I'm still fighting that today.\u00a0\u00a0When I was 18 I took over from my mom's constant care and nagging and it was a free for all for a while. I was desperately trying to be \"normal\" if you will.\u00a0\u00a0During my scare I was put into a program which helped me to control things a little more. Of course I had to still take insulin but a very nice and knowledable lady showed me how to adjust my insulin so I could eat and drink the things that other people could and most importantly at the times I wanted. All it took for me was to change my insulin and get the permission I needed to eat when, where and what I wanted and that's all it took. I also went into a diabetes support group as well.\u00a0\u00a0Now 3 children later I present with no problems with the exception to my recent baby losses due to my age. My health is good and I am able to control my diabetes with ease.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that he does not have to have a scare like mine to change his ways but give it time and he will begin to take charge of his diabetes again. He might just need a break and attempt to be \"normal\" for awhile. My suggestion to you is to make every effort to talk to him about your concerns in a loving and caring manner and make him aware of the consequences, but ultimately your right he is 18 and will make his own choices. If he does not respond to you find someone that he will listen to and have them talk with him about it. Also talking with the doctor about possible changes that will him to decide to take charge can be helpful too.Well I know it's long but I hope I helped.Karen",

            "answer": "dbryant,My husband was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes at 10 and is now 29.\u00a0\u00a0When we got together 4 years ago, he was not in a good place either.\u00a0\u00a0Since he was diagnosed, his mother made it her responsibiltiy to take care of his diabetes rather than teach him to be responsible.\u00a0\u00a0He never had to think about taking a reading or about when and what to eat as she was a constant reminder.\u00a0\u00a0This pushed him away and caused him to rebel.\u00a0\u00a0When he was 24, he finally moved out of the house.\u00a0\u00a0Since he never learned to remind himself of his responsibility, he didn't take his readings for several months.\u00a0\u00a0By this time, he had been on an insulin pump.\u00a0\u00a0He ended up in the hospital with keto-acidosis.\u00a0\u00a0Luckily he did not go into a coma, but it did scare him a bit.\u00a0\u00a0He stopped drinking and took his readings and ate better, but only for about 9 months.\u00a0\u00a0Still at his age, his mother would constantly ask him if he had taken his reading and was always on him about his diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I myself, tried to back off a bit as I knew how it only made things worse to push.\u00a0\u00a0It was very difficult.\u00a0\u00a0Finally after 8 days with 5 lows I made an appointment and begged his doctor to help me.\u00a0\u00a0I went with him to that appt and the doctor told me that I needed to let him be a man and back off.\u00a0\u00a0After my husband saw me in tears because of his doctor, he realized the pain he put on his family and he finally took charge of his diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It has been almost a year since that day and so far so good.\u00a0\u00a0He has his moments as I am sure all diabetics do, but I don't have to remind him to take his readings and he keeps good numbers.\u00a0\u00a0I guess what I am trying to say is try and give him his space, but keep an eye on him so that no harm comes to him.\u00a0\u00a0He will eventually find something to make him see how important his life is to himself and his family.\u00a0\u00a0From what my husband says, it is difficult growing up as a teenager with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Just as Karen said, find ways to let him eat and do what the others are doing and adjust the insulin to that.\u00a0\u00a0It does help.",

            "answer": "Dear dbryant,I am so sorry you are going through such a tough time. I understand what you are going through with your son, as I have been dealing with this since my son was 11.Your son may be having an episode with depression. I truly believe that anyone dealing with a chronic illness can have some levels with depression. While I am not a physician and can't give you medical advice, I can tell you my own experience. My son has experienced the same thing from 11 to 20.You have recieved some very excellent advice, but I am coming from a different point of view. While my son had a great medical team for his diabetes, we realised that he was suffering from depression. He found a councelor that dealt with both type 1 and depression. It has created a profound change in his life.I know how lost as parents we can feel. Believe me, you are not alone. I would like you to contact www.jdrf.org and click on life with diabetes and the online diabetes support team. This is a one on one line that could help you with additional support. I would like to give you additional information.In my Thought'sdm",

            "answer": "I haven't looked at the forum in a while but when I saw burnout I just knew I could relate.I just turned 19 and let me tell you that last 8 years have not been easy. When I was first diagnosed it was kind of surreal and I did what I was supposed to without missing a beat. But after about that first year I started to realize that other kids had ,it in my mind, a lot easier than I did. I was diagnosed at age 11 and my full blown rebellion started at 13.I didn't take care of my diabetes (DM) didn't take my shots, check my blood or anything. The good Lord was looking out for me because it is amazing I didn't go all the way into Diabetic-ketoacidosis (DKA) and even die. I always caught it before that stage and went to the ER and would get rehydrated.I lied to my parents, friends, doctors and anyone else who asked me if I was doing my part. I always said that there must be something wrong with me or the insulin. I did this for maybe a year and then one day I just changed my mind and decided to take care of myself. I have done pretty good for the past 6 years but this year for some reason seems especially hard. I haven't been testing as much as I should and I can't really give anyone a REAL reason. I have been giving insulin with my pump. I am just trying to not go into a full\u00a0\u00a0blown rebellion. I think I will be ok I just need a semi break and so maybe this Hb A1c won't be as good as the last one.My dad doesn't seem to understand so there are probably a a lot you who think I am just being lazy maybe I am I am not really sure but I know what your son is going through!!! I think as a teenager we just get to a point where enough is enough but the key is deciding how long one is willing to endanger their health. I know my parents tried to talk with me and sometimes it was just annoying so I think it will all have to do with when he is ready to take care of himself again. My theory on this stage of rebellion for lack of a better word is that I am now an adult and some of the real world realities are finally setting in.I know this was long but I hope this will help a little! I know it has helped me a little to get all this out in the open!Pumpgirl03Diabetes Advocate",

It can be called burnout, depression or even denial, but I feel we must explore this problem. We all learn from others dealing with type 1 diabetes.

            "answer": "Well, this is my first time on here. So - hello everyone.-I'm 20 and was diagnosed at the age of 4. Things really seem to pile up. I'm in college away from home so that doesn't help much either(as far as stress goes).It's kind of a difficult situation to be in - for anyone involved. I think some of the best help comes from positive support from those closest around you. I've been through enough times of not taking care of myself and thinking that it's simply not worth the effort and time to realize that in the end it's worth it. I think that a lot of the time, the best things to hear when you're in a position of \"burnout\" is a little personal positive encouragement from those around you. Rather than hearing the sometimes usual responses of \"you shouldn't do that\".Even with the utmost amount of support, it takes a very large part of personal responsibility as well. I still have to struggle with this. I just tend to remind myself that I do in fact have a choice.Well, hope that has helped someone. I'm going to finish my diet soda and maybe get some homework done! :)-Andy",
