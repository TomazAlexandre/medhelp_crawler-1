    "question": "So I've tried taking the 3 hour glucose test twice. I've thrown it up twice. Within 20 minutes if drinkng it.I know this doesn't mean I have gestational diabetes. Does anyone know what might happen now?? I don't have my appointment until Thursday to hear from my doc. Have you guys heard of just doing the diet without getting tested? Whenever I've had this drink I've been miserably sick for three days. I'll do anything to not take that test again.",
