            "answer": "If you are sexually active it may be your partner. keeping yourself clean has alot to do with yeast infections. In my first marriage my husband wouldn't take a bath maybe once a week and that's were mine were coming from. I told him if he couldn't keep himself clean he wasn't getting sex from me. This was very embarassing for me, it may not be for the men but it is for the woman. If this isn't it I suggest going to another doc for a second oppinion to make sure there is nothing major wrong. good luck",
