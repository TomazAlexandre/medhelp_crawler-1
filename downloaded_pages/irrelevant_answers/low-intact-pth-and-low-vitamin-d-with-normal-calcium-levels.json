D, but in your title you mention low PTH (parathyroid hormone?) and do you have a low level of this?See PM re: causes of vit. D deficiency.",

            "answer": "Just as reference to my weight loss. i am 5 foot 10 inches and weighed 210 pounds I now weigh 127. I think i have lost all that I can possibly lose. I am very weak compared to what I was able to do before. So I believe I have lost alot of muscle weight too. basically i have skin on bone. Not pretty naked. :) i eat alot too. So that is not the problem. I usually eat twice as much as most people.The reason he referred to the endo was because of the PTh being 9.7. Do you know anything about PTH that may help?I have been going to so many doctors but they can't find a problem. it kind of makes feel like I just must be crazy.",

    "question": "I have had so many tests and exams over the last 2 years and still don't have a diagnosis! I have left side rib pain all the time, i get severe muscle cramps in my legs, top of ankles and in feet every day and have lost 80 pounds without trying. I have severe fatigue, i don't want to do anything. Also have a racing heartbeat--just checked it now while been sitting still for quite a while and it is 118 beats a minute. I take klonopin 1mg twice a day. that should lower my rate, I would think?The only thing my doctor found was low vitamin D. I have been taking Calcitriol for over a year now. Currently my dose is 3- .5mg pills every day. I have been taking this dose for aprox....5 months. I just had a blood test done again last week and the results were as follows..... all 3 vitamin d levels were <4 and my intact pth was 9.7.I am a 36 year old female. I can't find anything that would relate to these test results. My calcium is normal.I have an appointment with an endocrinologist but it's not until the end of January. i would like some sort of idea as to what is going on with me. I wish there was a real Dr House. :)Is there anyone out there that can give me any ideas as to this?",
