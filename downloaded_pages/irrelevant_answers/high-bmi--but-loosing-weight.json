I went from 225 all the way down to 200 before I started gaining again. I'm nowup around 215-220 range and I'm twenty four weeks.As long as baby is growing and you aren't trying to lose weight, you should be okay.ps my mom had gestational diabetes while pregnant with me and walked out of the hospital after giving birth weighing six pounds less than the day she found out she was pregnant! I was perfectly healthy other than a touch of jaundice.",

            "answer": "I been losing weight my entire pregnancy. I was 26 pounds overweight and I lost 7 pounds since I was 25 weeks. Now im 32 weeks today and still losing. Just to be safe, my doctor scheduled another ultrasound to check the babys weight and my baby girl is doing perfectly fine weighing 4 pounds 2 ounces. I cant wait to see where my weight would be after I have the baby. 90% of the food I eat is healthy anyway.",

    "question": "Hi, I was wondering if anybody has had, or is in a similar situation. At my first appointment, 6 weeks ago, I had a BMI of 45.2, and was told to gain minimal weight, so that there is less problems, and chances of complications. A few days ago, I found out my bmi has dropped to 42.0, even though I feel like I've been eating like a pig. I've lost 20 lbs without even trying, and not being too active (was advised to take it easy, as I'm high risk, and have had a miscarriage before). I'm now 15.2 weeks, and I keep loosing weight, still not trying, and my boyfriend is getting concerned about the baby. The doctors aren't expressing any concerns, yet atleast, so I don't know if it's still okay, or when I should start getting concerned myself.",
