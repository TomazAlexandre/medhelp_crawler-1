            "answer": "You are actually in pretty good shape. While codeine is a narcotic and all it is not close to oxy and many others. 30mg is just one tylenol#3 - - - The same methods apply as any other opiate but it is the best to withdraw from. That doesnt mean that it is fun or dangerous, but it is doable. Use the Thomas Recipe and follow the Amino Acid Protocol. And have a good plan to commit to. When you arrive at a plan, put it in writing. Easier to follow and its a committment that you may take seriously. The only way it would be physically dangerous would be if you might have pre-existing conditions. High BP or diabetes - stuff like that. Only two groups will kill you without prior circumstances. Those are the benzodiazepine's and alcohol. Otherwise you need to overdose dramatically to kill yourself. But good luck to you in whatever method you employ. Keep reading. Plenty of great information in the health pages. And knowledge is power here.",
