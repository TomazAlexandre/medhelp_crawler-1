            "answer": "Hi there, and I read your post with much interest. My husband is the same age as you and was JUST diagnosed three weeks ago with hemochromatosis...HHC. It is hereditary. It is a mutation in the HFE gene and causes your body to store iron, in a hereditary scenario it is stored from birth. Once your body gets past a certain point of iron load, a body begins to store iron in organs, tissues and joints. Some of the first sypmtoms are joint and muscle pain, tenderness and swelling in fingers of hands, and general exhaustion, fatigue and muscle pain and weakness. We had never heard of this disease, and upon coming home from appt with internist who found the problem, (by accident, in search for genotype of Hep C to decide which course of treatment to pursue), and doing research on HHC we were astounded at the amount of \"common\" ailments iron overload is related to and what other disease this ailment is responsible for. My husband had complained for 10 years about the increasing joint and muscle pain, the fatigue and the dr.s attributed it to osteo-arthritis and/or fibromyalgia. Funny enough, on their own website, which a thread took me to in looking up hemochromatosis, they said that fibro and HHC symptoms mimic each other so well that those having been diagnosed with fibromyalgia have been finding at some point they actually have HHC.It is well worth looking onto based on your symptoms, age of onset, and if there are any other family members with any history of diabetes, liver cirrhosis, heart failure, thyroid issues, arthritis, gall bladder stones/disease,\u00a0\u00a0you have a Northern European heritage, especially Irish/Scot/Welsh, do yourself a favor and get your dr to test for this. It is simple blood test, not routine at this point, but 1 in 9 people are carriers and 1 in 200-250 develop HHC or related symptoms.It is called the silent killer, because most do not know they have it and symptoms vary. It is the most common genetic disorder rarely diagnosed in North America. And dr.s are missing this life-threatening condition.Please, for all who have these arthritic symptoms or diabetes or elevated liver enzymes that the dr cannot explain, they NEED to test you for this condition immediately.Ask for ferritin, tranferrin saturation, TIBC, serum iron, and get your liver enzyme tests for ALT, AST, GGT.Hope this helps anyone suffering, as I have watched my husband go from bad to worse, and this is a treatable and preventable condition that early detection is the KEY.Cheers",

    "question": "Is there a link between fibromyalgia and joint problems?\u00a0\u00a0I didn't think there was, however my body seems to be having more and more pain in my joints. I feel as if my general body tone is not strong. I am in constant pain of some type: from fibro, bursitis (in hip, knees, and one elbow), low back pain from scoliosis, and now tendonitis from computer use.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 57 and try to stay active, but I've got to say there are days that I feel like there's got to be some common link to all this pain.",
