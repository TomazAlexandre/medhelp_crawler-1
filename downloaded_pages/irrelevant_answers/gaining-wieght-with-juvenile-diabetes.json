            "answer": "As you may know, we're volunteers here & not medical professionals or nutritionists.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to check in with your doctor if you want to follow up on any suggestions you read here.\u00a0\u00a0Your endocrinologist knows your particulars and that's very important when evaluating general suggestions like we give here.Sometimes people with diabetes fail to gain weight because their blood sugar is running high much of the time.\u00a0\u00a0When the sugar is in our blood, it is not available to nourish our cells and so those cells are actually starving.\u00a0\u00a0The carbohydrates we eat are convereted to sugars and those sugars need \"the right amount\" of insulin to pass into our cells.\u00a0\u00a0That process is needed - in general - for anyone to gain weight.In addition, folks with consistently high blood sugar are consistently risking damage to their eyes, kidneys, heart, circulatory system, digestive system.My advice would be to work with your team for a check up on your blood sugar control to make sure you're not \"peeing out\" the nourishment you're trying to take on thru eating.\u00a0\u00a0Assuming that's all okay, then ask for a referral to a nutritionist and exercise specialist so they can help you tailor a plan to build healthy muscle & to gain weight thru a combination of fitness & food choices.Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Some more input on the subject of gaining weight.\u00a0\u00a0I've been trying to gain weight (muscle mass, specifically) since I was 16.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 32 now.\u00a0\u00a0No luck.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, you're just not genetically set up for it.\u00a0\u00a0That's not to say you can't get stronger though.\u00a0\u00a0I'm bench pressing north of 300lbs and I'm only 170 myself.\u00a0\u00a0But I don't look like a body builder.As mentioned in the previous comment, your blood sugar is the first place to start.\u00a0\u00a0It *NEEDS* to be balanced so that you're not starving yourself.\u00a0\u00a0If you're not *losing* weight, then it's likely your BS is OK.\u00a0\u00a0But keep on top of it.What muscle needs to develop is protein, plain and simple.\u00a0\u00a0Are you ingesting enough proteins for your muscles to build?\u00a0\u00a0If not, then you won't put on muscle mass.\u00a0\u00a0(This assumes that A)you're genetically able to get \"big\" and B)your blood sugars are OK.)One other thing to keep aware of is kidney function.\u00a0\u00a0If you've had a history of bad blood sugars, it's possible your kidneys are 'leaking' proteins into your urine.\u00a0\u00a0This can easily be found out through a 24 hour urine test (which you should be doing at least once a year anyhow.)\u00a0\u00a0If you're leaking proteins, adding more to your diet ain't gonna help.\u00a0\u00a0The kidney filters will need to be 'fixed' first.There are lots of things at play here.\u00a0\u00a0First and foremost: make sure you've got a balanced blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Then determine whether or not you can even gain weight.\u00a0\u00a0Look to the others in your family: are they generally thin or meaty?\u00a0\u00a0Once you're convinced you can safely gain the weight, start ingesting proteins either through big, juicy steaks (mmmmmmmmmmm....) or carb-free weight-gainer protein shakes.\u00a0\u00a0GNC has them.",
