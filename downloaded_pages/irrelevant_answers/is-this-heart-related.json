            "answer": "In order to see how likely you are to have coronary atherosclerosis I need to know your age and if you have any risk factors for CAD such as smoking, hypertension or diabetes melitus. On the other hand, the pain sounds very\u00a0\u00a0atypical for coronary atherosclerosis, but this pain may be related to some lung problem and not the heart. Hence, I would recommend a CT of the chest to evaluate for the presence of a pulmonary embolus, atypical pneumonia or other primary lung problem.",

I have had my blood pressure checked and the doctor said it was ok. I am not diabetic although my mother was a diet controlled diabetic. My mother died of a stroke at the age of 71 and my father died of a heart attack aged 74. You have suggested that I have a CT scan of the chest, is that something I can ask my doctor to arrange. I live in the UK.",

            "answer": "Also I have Reynauds syndrome which I have had since childhood. I would like to add that at no time do I suffer with breathing problems if this is any help. Would any lung problems not have shown up either on the chest X rays or the blood tests that were taken? If the diagnosis was coronary atherosclerosis, how serious is this and what is the prognosis?",

            "answer": "Hello.I'm a 17 year old male and have been experiencing chest pains for about two months now. I'm 5'6'' and I weigh 230 lbs plus I have asthma. Before the summer started, I was depressed and I started smoking marijuana. After the first 2 weeks, I had an episode where I called 911 because my heart was racing fast. It wore off after a while and I went back to smoking. One night I came home and I felt extremely paranoid. I told my mom what was happening (she's a nurse). Of course she was upset but she told me what I was feeling could be pleuritis. After this, I went to ER about 6 time now and everytime the tests showed that nothing was wrong with me. Even though they said nothing was wrong, I'm still feeling these pains and I'm worried because a family friend recently died and they found nothing wrong with him when he got checked up. They say that since I'm stressing it ,that's why I feel the way I do but I'm scared.Can anyone give me a possible explination?",

    "question": "8 months ago I started having pain across the upper region of my chest, I have been to A & E on 3 occasions where they have done ECG, chest X ray and blood tests all of which are normal. I was referred to a cardiologist who did a treadmill test which was normal so I was discharged. I have been to my doctor several times who thinks it could be Costochondritis and has prescribed anti inflammatory pills which I have been taking for 2 weeks but there is no improvement. The pain occurs almost every day and is in the upper chest region, sometimes central but mostly across the chest, occasionally my left arm aches but the pain in the chest is constant. I am worried that the doctors might have the diagnosis wrong as it is not improving.",
