            "answer": "Thanks curmudgen. Looks like there is no clear standards on this yet.This website says >11.4 = Elevatedhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomocysteineI read couple of books and they insist that to reduce this level below 6 if you also have borderline B12 deficiency (i.e 230-450 range) and have repeated coronary blockages despite having Cholesterol under control.B12 - Homocysteine - Heart disease link:http://www.amazon.com/Could-Be-B12-Epidemic-Misdiagnoses/dp/1884995691/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1300464344&sr=1-1Homocysteine - Heart disease linkhttp://www.amazon.com/Heart-Revolution-Extraordinary-Discovery-Cholesterol/dp/B003F76K2C/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1300464307&sr=1-2I am still doing some research on the topic and more and more it looks like 15 is waay too high if you have other symptoms.",

    "question": "Hi:This is a question about my father. He is 65 years old and diabetic with coronary heart disease. He is currently taking Diabetes and High Cholesterol(Statins) drugs. He has had Angioplasty 6 times during last few years and continue to have same issue almost every year or so.I was doing some research and came across the additional risk factor, \"Homocysteine\" to be another root cause of the heart blockages, in addition to high LDL. His LDL is now normal with meds but went to get his homocysteine levels checked. His results showed that his homocysteine was 13. Which is high as its supposed to be <11.I wanted another opinion on this because of two reasons.Reason 1: My father continued to have repeated blockages and stent procedures but doctor never ever checked \"Homocysteine\" before.Reason 2: When I insisted to check and it came out higher he is still saying its nothing to worry about.Its either doctor lacks awareness on homocysteine or he wants to stand by his decision of not doing the homocysteine tests earlier.Any feedback would be very helpful.",
