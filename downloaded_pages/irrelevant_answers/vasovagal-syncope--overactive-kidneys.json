            "answer": "Doubtful.\u00a0\u00a0Your syncope is likely not due to electrolyte imbalances, but to a direct link to an autonomic nervous system disorder.\u00a0\u00a0The vagal nerve sends the message that lowers your HR and BP (you know that) and if yours is overly reactive, syncope will occur.\u00a0\u00a0Electrolyte imbalances can cause many types of arhythmia, but having been on the tilt table and observed during a \"spell\" if your doctor did not connect those two dots then it is unlikely to be connected.Urinating often can be a sign of diabetes and/or prostate enlargement.\u00a0\u00a0Neither of these is directly connected to the syncope but the symptom (frequent urination) is worth mentioning to your doctor.I will say, however, that if you have low BP to begin with, frequent urination could ultimately decrease blood VOLUME, which can lower the BP even more...resulting in syncope.Get it checked out.\u00a0\u00a0There could be a link...all be it indirect.",

            "answer": "Have your ADH(antidiuretic hormone) checked as well as your ACTH level checked. Did your Dr. check your cortisol levels before giving you th Rx for fluodrocortisone if not have that checked immediately.If the soda you drink has caffeine,watch out caffeine is a diuretic so the soda is dehydrating you, monitor your BP very close. Consider some of these ddxs, adrenal fatigue,addisons or just plain old dehydration, cut out the soda and switch to an electrolyte drink. Do you ever notice one of your pupils more dilated than the other?",

    "question": "I had a vasovagal syncope episode while on duty (I am a fire officer and paramedic). On scene my initial h.r. was around 50. My blood glucose was 110. I was kept in the hospital over night. Three 12 lead ecgs\u00a0\u00a0and three cardiac enzymes were negative for M.I.I had a tilt test the next week. I passed out during the tilt test, and had a 4 second pause in my h.r. The dr. has placed me on flouracortizone (I'm sure this is spelled wrong) advised me to eat lots of salty foods (which I already do) and drink pleny of fluids.I exercise regularly and am in very good shape. I have a history of hypothyroid, and take meds which are keeping it at a good level. I have no other medical history, and my only family history is hypothyroid.I am concerned that I urinate to much. I have to urinate approx. 16 times a day.\u00a0\u00a0I drink approx. 40 ounces of water , and two 12 ounce soft drinks a day. I have tried to increase my fluid in take above this level but it makes me have to urinate even more often.Is it possible that my constant urination is throwing my electrolytes of balance causing my syncopal episodes?",
