            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, you are having some neurological problem involving one half of your body. First of all a MRI can only rule out seizures that are caused by some worm in brain or bleed or tumor or brain injury. It is not the test to diagnose seizures due to faulty chemical impulses in the brain. This is done by an EEG or Electro Encephalo Gram. Again having a normal EEG does not rule out epilepsy or seizures. It is just a diagnostic aid and is often normal in people having seizures. It can also be abnormal in those not having seizures.Hypertension, diabetes, strokes or transient ischemic attacks too should be looked into. A CT scan or MRI of the brain should be done to rule this out.The third possibility is cervical nerve compression very high up. Again an MRI will be diagnostic.It could also be due to hypoglycemia.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Consult a neurologist regarding this as soon as possible. If you are unable to get this soon, and if you have a similar attack, rush to the ER for the tests. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
