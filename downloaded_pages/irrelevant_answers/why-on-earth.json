But it would do your husband good to lose the extra weight, as being overweight increases your chances of becoming diabetic, especially type 2 also\u00a0\u00a0known as adult onset diabetes.good luck, bret",

            "answer": "I'm another volunteer here and I agree with what BL has said about many doctors seeming to be rather complacent about Type 2 goals.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the docs themselves are burnt out trying to convince folks to take this seriously and they assume that all newly diagnosed Type 2s simply will not do so.\u00a0\u00a0I've heard from so many Type 2 -- who report rather high numbers -- that their docs don't say much.\u00a0\u00a0That interaction seems to suit a non-motivated diabetic so s/he is unlikely to find another doc who is more aggressive in treating a disease with potentially devastating complications.\u00a0\u00a0Many doctors are not diabetes specialists and so they may not fully understand the disease.While I'm also not a doctor, our risks for complications are -- in large measure -- a function of how high our blood sugars are for how long.\u00a0\u00a0If we magically were able to keep our BG within normal ranges all the time, our risks for complications would be minimal.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, folks whose bodies \"adjust\" to the trauma of consistently high blood sugars begin to risk serious, accumulating damage.\u00a0\u00a0Sadly, many folks with Type 2 walk around for months & years with average blood sugars well above what you report.\u00a0\u00a0Those folks are at greater risk than your husband, but your instinct that his results aren't good enough is correct.Because your husband can function, and because he may be very scared, he might be emotionaly unwilling to \"deal with it.\"\u00a0\u00a0Ultimately, each person with diabetes makes our own choices -- despite what those around us may want.\u00a0\u00a0For your part, continue to encourage him by preparing healthy meals and gradually eliminating junk foods from the family home.\u00a0\u00a0Generally, a healthy diet for a diabetic is identical to a healthy diet for the rest of the world so it can be in everyone's best interest.An additional resource you might look into is a Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE).\u00a0\u00a0These folks are typically not physicians but they have specialized training to help us diabetics develop lifestyle (food choices, carbohydrate counting, safely integrating physical activity, etc.) choices that will help.\u00a0\u00a0Folks who may be initimated with a doctor can often feel safe with a CDE.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, consider getting a referral to an endocrinologist instead of having your hubby treated by a general GI doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Endos specialize in treating folks with diseases like diabetes and they understand fully the risks & rewards & challenges that Type 2s face.",

            "answer": "Thanks for both your comments.\u00a0\u00a0But he now thinks I'm delusional since \"if the doctor didn't think there was a problem, I shouldn't either\".(but he's still eating better, I notice.\u00a0\u00a0So he is somewhat concerned even though he won't say anything)Unless he is diagnosed with something, we can't really see anyone like a CDE unless we pay for it out of pocket.\u00a0\u00a0And since he now feels vindicated that the doctor thinks he's fine, he probably wouldn't go anyway.\u00a0\u00a0And if the doc thinks he's ok right now, no referral to an endo.\u00a0\u00a0I might get a BG monitor and do some checking at home.I'm going to continue to do just what you said-keep the junk out of the house and fix healthy meals.\u00a0\u00a0So far he's cooperative, but with a man you can only do so much.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe with some weight loss things will be ok.",

    "question": "Why would medical professionals from a prestigious large nationally known medical institution tell my husband not to worry about possible diabetes?He is 60# overweight, has hypertension, high triglycerides, and liver disease but has no family history of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Recently, his fasting blood sugar (done for other reasons) was 155.\u00a0\u00a0I was concerned and called his doctors office and spoke to the nurse.\u00a0\u00a0She said that \"wasn't bad\" at all.\u00a0\u00a0She agreed to let him repeat it when I persisted in requesting it.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, I couldn't get my husband to go in for the repeat blood draw.\u00a0\u00a0I tried to put the fear of God in him about the early stages of diabetes in order to motivate him to lose weight and improve his horrible sugar and junk food eating habits.When he went to see his GI doc (again, large nationally known facility) he was again told \"oh, we see that all the time, it's not bad\" and it was agreed he should just \"try\" to lose weight and be seen for follow up in 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0Now he thinks I'm overreacting, but I do see some improvement in what he's eating.I guess I'm ok with just following it for now and seeing what some good weight loss will do, but puzzled at this casual atmosphere from a facility that should be sharp and up to date with the latest medical information.What do you think?",
