            "answer": "I've experienced this and went to doctor after doctor (internist, dermatologist, rheumatologist, infectious disease...) when it became severe enough to wake/keep me up and came back after a month free of it. (I also started sweating and always felt warm which scared the heck out of me). I wish I had some answers for you, but it was a mystery to each doctor. All I can suggest is probably obvious: switch to dye-free, frangrance free laundry detergent, bath soap, lotions, etc. Also, be sure to wash all your linens in it.Like me, you have it mainly on the trunk of your body, so it doesn't make sense that it's just sheets, but it can't hurt. Although, that might just be the more sensitive skin for you, too.Best of luck in figuring it out. Keep me updated.",

            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin that isn't accompanied by other obvious skin changes, such as a rash, is most often caused by dry skin (xerosis). Dry skin usually results from environmental factors like hot or cold weather with low humidity levels, long-term use of air conditioning or central heating, and washing or bathing too much.Other conditions cause itchy skin as well. Skin conditions like dermatitis and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Pls take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch.Lastly,Phototherapy can also be tried.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing and if you have any additional queries.",
