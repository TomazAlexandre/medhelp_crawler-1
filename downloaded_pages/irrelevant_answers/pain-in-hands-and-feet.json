            "answer": "The pins and needles and numbness suggest diabetic neuropathy, and an evaluation by an endochronologist is in order. You require a test known as an Hba1c. The calf pain suggests a condition known as intermittitant claudication, which is also common in late stage diabetes and is caused by circulatory deficiency. So square two is an evaluation by a vascular specialist, to evaluate the dorsilis pedis pulses, and perhaps have a color doppler of the legs.",
