            "answer": "There are a number of different blisters each with specific outcomes if left untreated. Blisters that \"have started to move up his leg.\" sounds like a serious/dangerous infection requiring immediate attention. As Dee stated, you need to be with your father when he sees his doctor/s so you can hear first hand what is being discussed. When you say \"they dont seem to be able to tell him anything.\" doesn't make sense because something was said between the doctor and your father but not being conveyed to you properly.",
