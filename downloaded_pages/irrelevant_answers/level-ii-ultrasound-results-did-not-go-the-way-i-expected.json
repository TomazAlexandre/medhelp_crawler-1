I bet when you get your next U/S done, baby will behave a little better, lol. Mine was sitting on her feet today but they finallly got her to move and got her little girl parts again to confirm the last U/S . I hope these next 2 weeks fly by for you so you can find out weather its a girl or a boy:)",
