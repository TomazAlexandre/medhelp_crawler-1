            "answer": "Hi,Could you clarify a bit on compression at the neck? How was this diagnosed? Was it through an MRI of the spine or the X-Ray of the cervical spine? If it is bilateral and is located in the cervical spine, surgery should help.But the cause can be manifold: Are there any pain associated? Steroid injection at the knee should not cause this symptoms, as it is local and not systemic. If it's sysemic, it may cause osteoporosis leading to fracture, but if it's a fracture than it should not be at cervical spine and there should be more disastrous results.There is no medicine indeed if the cause is due to physical compression, surgery is the treatment of option. However, are there any other areas being affected other than the upper limbs? And are other nerve also affected? Your mother has Diabetes and poorly controlled diabetes can lead to neuropathy which has similar symptoms as well. Management of Diabetes neuropathy is of course a stricter control of blood glucose to prevent deterioraton. However, it usually starts from the legs instead of the hands and upper limbs.These are just my opinions and please talk to your doctor for any actions you will take!!",
