    "question": "I am scheduled for a right heart cath to check pressures for a pulmonary hypertension diagnosis. My echo showed left ventricular hypertrophy also. I think I should have both a left and right heart cath to check for the reasons for the hypertrophy since I don't have high blood pressure, am not obese and don't have diabetes. I do have a connective tissue disease. My previous two echoes showed left ventricular diastolic dysfunction but the most recent one didn't. Was this just \"missed\" on the last echo or can it disappear while hypertrophy remains? Should I insist on both sides of the heart being catherized?",
