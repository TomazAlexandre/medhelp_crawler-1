            "answer": "It wpuld depend in why you are high risk.\u00a0\u00a0Women with a history of multiple miscarriages would be high risk for every pregnancy. I will be high riak for every pregnancy because birth control with estrogen in it makes me have high blood pressure so there is a chance that the pregnancy will do the same due to extra hormones. However a woman who is obese may be high risk for gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, still birth, etc. but with weight loss they may not classify a subsequent pregnancy as high risk.",

    "question": "Just wondering is it once you have a \"high risk\" pregnancy, are all the following considered high risk or is each pregnancy treated separately? Pregnancy #1 I miscarried at 19wks from placental abruption (no blood I only knew via ultrasound) so Pregnancy #2 I was considered HR and induced on my due date to avoid complications & everything went fine. I'm now on Pregnancy #3 & wondering are they going to classify me as HR or normal since my daughter was born with no major issues",
