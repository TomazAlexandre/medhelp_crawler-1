            "answer": "Anxiety can cause any number of symptoms. One of the possible symptoms for some people are nosebleeds due to temporary spikes in blood pressure which may damage blood vessels and lead to bleeding).I am anti drug so if I can find a natural product that does the job then I'll be trying it out.\u00a0\u00a0I have found Brauer's Nervatona Focus is excellent for anxiety. I used to spray it under my tongue and it worked in minutes. Amazing stuff. I live in Australia so this product probably isn't available overseas. There is a similar product available worldwide called Bach's Rescue Remedy. I'd recommend the sublingual spray.Since correcting a long list of reasons for anxiety I felt some improvement but it took two months of exercising half an hour a day to be calm central. When I stop exercising that calm feeling starts to vanish.",

            "answer": "Forgot to mention that no matter what you take for anxiety, it's best to try to get some type of therapy to try to find and eliminate the underlying cause of anxiety...\u00a0\u00a0It can be, simply, the hormonal imbalance or it could be something completely unrelated.Hormone levels will need to be gotten under control and that can't happen by testing only TSH.\u00a0\u00a0Your TSH was higher than normal, indicating that FT3 and FT4 might be too low in the ranges for you...You need to get those tested, as well.",
