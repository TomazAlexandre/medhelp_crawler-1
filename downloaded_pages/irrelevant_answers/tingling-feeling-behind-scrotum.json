            "answer": "Hello,This tingling feeling can be due to parastehsia skin. They are common in diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition. Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the sensations are gone or not.In case the symptoms persist, then please get an examination done from a physician.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your time and input Dr. Singh. I will definitely see if these are the problems or not. The local doctor informed me that it was most probably something fungal related such as \"jocks itch\" I'm hoping its nothing serious.",

    "question": "Hi,I have been feeling this tingling type of sensation behind the scrotum ( where the scrotum meets the skin) . Its been on and off for about 2 weeks now. I don't have any burning sensation while urinating nor do i have any swelling of the testicles. All i could say is that it just tingles at the area where the skin and the scrotum start.I don't know if its achy, because its not strong enough to actually \"bother\" me. No color change in urine, it is the same sometimes clear and mostly yellow.I have tested negative for all STD's, i do however have HPV but i doubt that it is relative to the tingling sensation. All STD test were done 4 months after possible exposure. I had a urine analysis and blood test done. All came back negative.I can't put my finger on it. I have however been taking\u00a0\u00a0a big capsule of multivitamins daily. I don't know if this could be the cause but just throwing it out there. Not overdosing on it and just taking one capsule. I never really taken vitamins before, i have been consistent with them for about almost a month now.There is no pain anywhere else at the area of my genitals, no sharp pain running up or down my leg and no lower back pain either.Any help would be much appreciated, thank you.",
