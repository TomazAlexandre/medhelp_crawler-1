            "answer": "Thyroid disease can be hereditary. I have Hashimoto's. My mom and grandma had it.Get your TGab and TPOab bloodwork to determine if you have Hashi. A thyroid ultrasound will tell what your thyroid looks like and if you have nodules.Also, get your TSH, FT3 and FT4 tests to determine your current thyroid levels.Your symptoms sound Hashi. I get the rashes, and everything you get. The lymph nodes swell and then go down. Before taking thyroid hormone, I would swing from hyper to hypo as my thyroid nodules leaked hormone. I would be tired, constipated, depressed one week, then wired, diarrhea, anxious the next. Untreated Hashimoto's can lead to a host of other problems.Your body relies on thyroid hormone. It is the grease that keeps our wheels turning. If you are lacking it or you have too much, then your entire body, skin, kidneys, stomach, brain, feet, EVERYTHING, reacts.I control my rashes with beta blockers combination Zyrtec and Zantac, but in order to manage Hashimoto's, you will need thyroid hormone pills or you will get MUCH worse.:) Tamra",
