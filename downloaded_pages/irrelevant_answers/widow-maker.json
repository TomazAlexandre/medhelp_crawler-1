            "answer": "Hi, according to studies done, arteries have better outcomes than veins. Several studies have shown that after 7 to 10 years, the patency of internal-mammary-artery grafts is 85 to 95 percent. Intrinsic vein-graft disease has been correlated with abnormal levels of serum cholesterol and triglycerides, diabetes, elevated low-density lipoprotein. So, controlling the high risk factors is important to prevent closure of grafts. Regards.",
