They did an electroencephalogram (EEG) where they put wires on your head (doesn't hurt). and measure your brain activity. The other other think would be an arrhythmia or heart problem. A lot of times these are benign or no problem but some are. So, you may ask your parents to take you in to check a good checkup.",

Ever since Saturday afternoon at work (3days ago)\u00a0\u00a0I have been getting light headed and start to tremor.. my heart starts to race and I feel weak. I noticed that it happens more when I am standing and make any kind of forces. Like when I laugh or get really excited, or when I get upset, or even when im moving around alot or picking up stuff. The only time I feel okay is if I sit or lay down.",
