            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Chest pounding can be due to low blood pressure. Try to take some fluids like lemonade, soups etc and see if this helps. Please avoid caffeine. If the symptoms do not improve go to urgent care. The BP is low but not dangerously low. Keep monitoring it.If symptoms subside, consult your doctor when available. Dehydration, certain medications, heart problems, untreated diabetes, and nervous system disorders can all cause hypotension. Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Addisons\u2019 disease, hypoglycemia, VitB12 and folate deficiency can all cause hypotension. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you!I did think of dehydration, but had ruled it out largely because I'm always a thirsty person and usually get in at least 5 glasses of water a day - but I will absolutely try to get in more today and see if it help.I will keep monitoring, thank you so much for answering!",

    "question": "I'm 24, female, slightly overweight but largely quite healthy. I've had no problems in years (I did have basal cell carcinoma 5 years ago, no recurrence since then) besides the normal head colds and the like, I've a very clean bill of health and just had my yearly checkup and blood work done two months ago.For about 28 hours now, however, I've been experiencing a lot of pressure on my chest. With it came the feeling like my heart was pounding - I took my pulse and found it at 104 - my normal resting heart rate is 62-66. My fiance has a blood pressure machine for home use, and my BP was 94/64 (normally 115/77).I had a lot of trouble sleeping because the chest pressure turns to pain when laying down.I have taken my BP and pulse a few more times since then - my systolic BP is up some, but my diastolic continues to drop. 10 minutes ago, it was 104/54. My pulse rate is hovering around 80 - which is better than last night's count, but still high for me.My doctor isn't open on weekends and the urgent care has 3 hour wait. I'm just looking for help or insight or whether I should really see a doctor at all.",
