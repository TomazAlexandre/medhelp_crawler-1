            "answer": "Hi Jojo8,I am glad that you found us at the Pain Management Community of MedHelp. Cold legs are at the least annoying and I am sorry you are experiencing this symptom. In Wisconsin my feet are often cold.Cold extremities, especially the lower limbs are often a symptom of poor circulation. Arteriosclerosis of the extremities is a disease of the blood vessels characterized by narrowing and hardening of the arteries that supply the legs and feet. This causes a decrease in blood flow and therefore cold legs. In time arteriosclerosis can also injure nerves and other tissues. This condition can and often is more commonly know as PVD,Peripheral vascular disease or PVD; Peripheral arterial disease.As we age many of us suffer from this condition to one degree or another.\u00a0\u00a0If you have older relatives you will most likely note that they often complain of being cold, this is due to lack of good circulation and all a part of the wonderful condition know as \"aging.\" There are other conditions that can produce poor circulation such as diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Blood brings warmth to our extremities. It is important that you discuss your symptoms with your PCP. It may be normal but it is always important to inform your PCP of all your symptoms.Best of luck to you. Please keep in touch and let us know how you are doing. And as always, Take Care, Tuck",

            "answer": "Hello Jojo:Welcome to the Pain Forum. There are many reasons for your cold legs and one of the most common is a disease called Raynaud's Syndrome. When your body is exposed to cold temperatures, your extremities lose heat. Your body slows down blood supply to your fingers and toes to preserve your body's core temperature. Your body specifically reduces blood flow by narrowing the small arteries under the skin of your extremities. In people with Raynaud's, this normal response is exaggerated. Another known cause isStress. Stress causes a similar reaction to cold in the body, and likewise the body's response may be exaggerated in people with Raynaud's. Doctors don't know why this happens. It is still a mystery why some people sufer with it and others don't. Anyway, hang in there...Winter will be over in a few months. Take care.Mollyrae",
