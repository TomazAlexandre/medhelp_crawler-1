            "answer": "I have been having strange, unexplainable sensations in my hands lately as well. The feeling is like they are being tickled from the inside or like an itch I can't scratch feeling. Almost like I feel my hands are weak and shaky but they don't shake and are not weak. It's weird.I also have the sensation in my right foot and oddly enough, in my tongue and below my tongue. These sensations are present for at least half my day and I can't stop thinking about it.It's extremely frustrating and all I want for it is to go away as well. I have a history of anxiety and I know anxiety and stress can make your body behave in all kinds of strange ways. Last year for example I had a breathing problem where it felt like I could never get enough air and my face would go numb and my hands. I was sure it was something like adult onset asthma or emphysema. Turned out to be stress and after nine months of worrying, it finally subsided. I have a good feeling that what I'm experiencing is caused by the same thing that caused that. I've been on a lot of message boards and read a lot of cases with both mine, and your symptoms, and it seems like most people think they have something really wrong with them but really it's just the anxiety talking.At the same time, I'm completely freaked out and scared I have some serious neurological disorder like MS. I can't help it. I'm going to try yoga and breathing exercises. Maybe you should try something like that...and try your best to not stress about your symptoms and accept them and maybe that's when they will go away. Though at the same time, I wish I could follow my own advice.",

            "answer": "Hey,Thanks for the responses guys. I pondered it might be Carpel Tunnel but thought it couldn't be because sometimes it is in my little finger.About the stress factor, it's certainly a possibility. But these symptoms are so real I find it difficult my body in just playing up due to stress. I just really hope it passes and never comes back, I honestly think I've got some neurological problem.Thanks for the advice guys.Cheers",

    "question": "Hi guys,I'm after some help or advice whatever you've got because I think I'm going nuts with my current symptoms I'm experiencing.It started at the beginning of September 09 with light pins and needles right int he tips of my fingers on my right hand. It then has progressed on the other hand, and then vice versa. There doesn't seem to be any pattern to what fingertips it will happen too but generally is the middle, ring, thumb, index. Sometimes it happens to the little finger as well.The pins and needles can be described as like electrical sensations pulsating on my fingertips. It's crazy but there has been a week or two since it started that i won't experience anything. I then think it has gone away and then it restarts.Now I have been to my GP and he did a blood test. All was ok, he tested for blood counts, diabetes, thyroid, liver, kidneys, B12 etc. He then referred me to a Neurologist. I was sent for further blood tests and an MRI of both the neck and brain.Surprise surprise, the MRI showed no degeneration in the neck at all and the brain was perfectly normal with no demylination present. The blood test came back all normal except I was a bit low on Vitamin D. The neurologist has put me on some Vitamin D supplements, which I have been taking for the last 2 weeks. He has also referred me for an Evoked Response test next week.Anyway does anyone have a clue what I could be dealing with here, it doesn't appears to be MS, tumours, spinal issues, hyperventilation / anxiety (my breathing is normal), diabetes or anything else I can think off. I just want this **** to go away because I'm really\u00a0\u00a0stressing out over this as I have no idea what I'm dealing with and it appears that my dr's don't know either.Any suggestions, tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.CheersSherovo",
