            "answer": "I'm sorry about the loss of your father. It sounds like your father's medical situation was very complex and I don't think anyone on a Discussion Board can tell you what your father died from. Often people die from several things combining to weaken their system to the point where one or more systems fail.You don't say how old your father was. My personal suggestion would be to try and let go of all the questions and just grieve your father and think about all the things you loved about him when he was here. If you feel unable to do that, then maybe ask the doctor to sit down and explain it to you in terms that a non-medical person can understand.",

    "question": "My father has diabetes and high blood pressure. He suffered from paralytic stroke. And then he was recovered. He got insulin injection everyday. After 2 months later , he suffered abdominal pain and made medical check up every parts of body such as Hep B,C ,HIV, TB,Malaria and Chest X ray, ultra sound again and again.Due to X ray'result, there is a little water in his lung but they said it is no problem. Doctors could not find any other disease. And then we took CT scan and doctors decided that there is a mass inside his intestine.But when\u00a0\u00a0operation was made actually,there is no mass inside. Doctors said again this is due to folding of intestine. So they put the intestine as normal position and appendix was cut. After making operation, my father lost appetite , suffered tightly in his womb and constipation. So he became weak and finally he can breath by giving oxygen artificially and suffer congestion in the lungs. TB bacteria check was made two more times. Now he passed away. Just before he dies, doctors ask to take X ray and to check the TB bacteria again. There was no bacteria in his saliva but X ray show some damage symptom on his lung. So they concluded that this is TB suspect. I can not believe it. I do not want to hear that my father had TB suspect. I thought that this may be due to\u00a0\u00a0health problem related with diabetes.I really want to know the actual reason which disease can cause my father to die.",
