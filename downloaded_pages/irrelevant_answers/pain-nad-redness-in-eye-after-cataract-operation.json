            "answer": "Both my wife and I have had both eyes done for cataracts. I also have had both eyes with retinal tears and operations. It sounds like your father has \"Dry Eye\". This is a common problem with cataract surgery and is treated by using a sterile lubricant. The medications taken for inflammation and infections can contain chemicals that irritate the eye. MY wife dealt with this for over 4 months. It was cured with the use of lubrication drops.Buy these drops. They are at any pharmacy (Walmart probably the cheapest) Buy no preservative drops. They come in a box with many single application vials of enough liquid to do both eyes. You snap the cap off and use it then throw it away. It is important to get no preservative drops as the preservative in drops can cause eye irritation if used over a long period. If he uses these faithfully and three or 4 times a day he should find an improvement over time.Not a doctor etc but we have dealt with this.",
