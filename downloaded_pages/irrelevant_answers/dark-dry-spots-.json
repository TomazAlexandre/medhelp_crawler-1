            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.It is hard to guess at what is causing your dark spots without seeing them, but one possibility would be Acanthosis nigracans. This is a fairly common skin discoloration. The hallmark of acanthosis nigracans is dark patches of skin with a thick, velvety texture which may appear in many places on the body including skin folds.Acanthosis nigricans can be a symptom of more serious health problems such as pre-diabetes. It usually clears up when the underlying medical condition is successfully treated.I recommend that you see your doctor about theses spots. If acanthosis nigricans is the cause, your doctor would be the best person to prescribe treatment.I hope this helpsCathy",
