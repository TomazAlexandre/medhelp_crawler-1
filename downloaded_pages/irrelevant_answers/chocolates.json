            "answer": "As you have posted your question in the Diabetes Type 2 community, I will assume that you are have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes.If that is the case, the answer to your question is: Yes, eating a lot of milk chocolate is bad.What you need to remember is that all sugary foods, cakes, biscuits, chocolates, sugary drinks, will spike up your blood sugars very quickly and then the blood sugars will drop very quickly.It is fine to have some chocolate, but don't eat too much all in one go.Have a healthy and well balanced meal and a piece of chocolate as a treat.What you do not want is your sugars going up so high quickly and then plummeting down again quickly.\u00a0\u00a0 Uncontrolled high sugar levels will lead to complications, like never damage, loss of eyesight, amputations.Make an appointment to see your doctor ask for a HbA1C blood test to find out your average blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0This gives the average of glucose in the blood over a period of 9-12 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Ask your doctor to refer you to a dietician who specialises in diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0There is lots of information on the Diabetic websites too.",

            "answer": "If you have an addiction to sugar, you can gradually decrease the amount you consume.\u00a0\u00a0For example, if you take 2 teaspoons of sugar with your beverage, cut it down by a quarter or half a teaspoon.\u00a0\u00a0Your taste buds will gradually get accustomed to the lower amount and then you can reduce it again.This is how I weaned myself off having sugar in my beverages down to 0.So for the chocolate issue, rather than eating a whole box of chocolates (which is what could easily do), if you cannot resist, then don't buy them so that you can avoid the temptation or buy a small packet.\u00a0\u00a0When shopping avoid the isles with the sweet things.\u00a0\u00a0It is very tempting to buy more to keep in the cupboard and especially if there are good offers on.\u00a0\u00a0Let people know that you do not wish to have chocolates and sweet things as gifts.Arilou, you are correct that the artificial sweetners are not healthy and some contain chemicals.\u00a0\u00a0Some people have allergies to these chemicals in the sweetners.\u00a0\u00a0Research that I have read also suggests that consuming sweetners can also become addictive making you crave for sweet things.When I bake, I reduce the quantity of sugar in a recipe by as much as 2oz and still get good results; I also reduce the amount of fat by more or less the same amount depending what mood I am in.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is all a bit of trial and error to begin with so do experiment with your baking.\u00a0\u00a0Meringue and fatless sponge cakes are different and reducing the sugar content by half an ounce that the recipe says, is still likely to work.The HbA1C blood test measures the glucose that sticks to the red blood corpuscles.\u00a0\u00a0As the red blood cells renew around every 9-12 weeks, the test gives a better picture of how you are monitoring your diabetes.The home monitor only gives the sugar levels in the blood at the point of doing the test strip.Simple carbohydrates convert quickly into glucose, so it is not just the chocolates and sweets that need to be taken into account.\u00a0\u00a0Any food that contains fibre is a better because the energy is slowly released into the blood stream rather than a high surge of energy only for it to plummet down very quickly after eating anything that is refined.\u00a0\u00a0Refined foods are white bread, cakes, biscuits, pasta, sweets, chocolates, even fizzy drinks and fruit juices.No food is banned, but you do need to make healthy options and also remember healthy portion sizes.\u00a0\u00a0You can find information about a \"Healthy Plate\" on the web that shows you the portion sizes of the types of food to be eaten on a healthy eating plan.Best wishes.",

Like it is very nutritious, is a powerful source of antioxidant, it improves blood flow and lower blood pressure.It reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, it also acts as an excellent sun block and most importantly it improves brain function. But most of them do not like the taste of dark chocolates. I'm also not a fan of dark chocolate except that of Giddy Yoyo chocolate bars.",
