I have to somewhat correct what I have written here - I'm told by others that MS can cause circulation problems - I learn something new every day about this MiSerable disease.Be sure to check with you doctor to determine the true cause of your swelling.Compression stockings would be useful if your problem is circulatory.\u00a0\u00a0Compression stockings would be harmful if you have diabetes or gout.\u00a0\u00a0Its hard to know for sure which would work for you.However, I stand by my advice to get off your feet when possible and elevate them.\u00a0\u00a0Regardless of the cause of the swelling, you need to get the fluids flowing and elevating them is one way.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, we all could use a legit excuse to lay down and rest, right?\u00a0\u00a0LOLbe well,Lulu",
