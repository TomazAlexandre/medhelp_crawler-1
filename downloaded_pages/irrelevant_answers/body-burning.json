            "answer": "I've been experiencing a burning sensation in my hands, especially if I bend them back- for instance to pull down the sun visor in the car. Most recently I have severe burning sensation in the back of my neck. Again, I feel it most when I'm bending my head down to read. (I've been studying a lot). However, my question is why do I actually have what appears to be a burn right on the area that I've been experiencing this burning sensation? I pointed this out to both my dermatologist and my internal medicine doctors, both pretty much brushed my questions off and gave no recommendations. Your response to Rwot\u00a0\u00a0to consider lupus or a thyroid condition struck a cord with me, as one of the medications my dermatologist prescribed for my hair loss is Hydroxychloroquine which in some cases is used \"to treat certain auto-immune diseases (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis)\" per the Kaiser Permanete (KP.Org) website.\u00a0\u00a0Do doctors withhold information from their patients? Or do they just want to avoid running additional tests?",

    "question": "For the last five years I have been suffering from a burning sensation on my body, it is mostly on my limbs but is spreading to the rest of the body. in my palms and sole of my feet i experience rashes deep under my skin and it heals by itself and the skin peels off. I feel like i smeered myself with chilli sauce and this inceases when the weahter is hot and i begin sweating, I feel alot of heat being generated from within my body and I feel as if my skin is very dry. I have tested for HIV/AIDS nerve disorder, diabetes, uric acid, syphillis etc but all results are negative. i can't sleep while covering myself as I would feel horribly hot. What could be the disease disturbing me?",
