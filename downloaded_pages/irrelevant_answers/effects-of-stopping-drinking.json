            "answer": "Hi Nedos Congrats on your One Month Sober!!!!! It's great that you're getting out to a meeting everydayThere's many reasons why you may be tired during the day that you can control, like your diet, how much and how you deal with stress, and how you incorporate exercise into your life. There are diseases that have fatigue as a side effect, so you need to get to your family doctor, and let them know you've been sober a month , and have them do a thorough physical.I think that you should be reading as much as you can on how your diet exercise and stress play a role in your health. Here's a few articles..https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200310/fighting-fatigue-diethttp://www.livestrong.com/article/331002-foods-to-avoid-when-feeling-tired-all-the-time/http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-7829/5-diet-changes-that-helped-me-overcome-chronic-fatigue-syndrome.htmlI picked up a book by Dr> Joel Fuhrman, called Eat to Live, It's an incredible read. His diet is all about reversing diabetes and disease while having the most energy one could have. It's a plant based diet. Most of the articles up above all talk about fat etc being the reason for chronic fatigue, so after you read from all the sources, that talk about cutting out certain foods, you can read Dr. Fuhrman's book and cookbook and you'll be doing the absolute best thing you could for your body and your mind.Hey you've made a huge change in your life so far, might as well continue on with the momentum and put some other program s in place for yourself.",

    "question": "Hi all, I'm a 45 year old male alcoholic, I've been a heavy drinker (approx 10 units a day, almost every day for last few years). I've stopped drinking. Doing AA meetings every day and currently sober for 1 month. Great I'm sober, but I'm feeling incredibly tired most of the time. I usually need a sleep for an hour or two every afternoon, am in bed by 10-11:00 pm every night, then up at 6:00am. When I'm awake I'm pretty lethargic. I've heard this is a common consequence when people stop drinking. My question is, how long is it likely to last? Thanks in advance, Nedos.",
