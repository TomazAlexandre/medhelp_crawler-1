            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion, i.e. once all other diseases of the colon like colitis, infections, tumors etc. have been ruled out, then the diagnosis of IBS is made. The pain could sometimes be due to the postoperative fibrosis. Hope diabetes has been ruled out. Diabetes can cause autonomic neuropathy and affect the digestive system, leading to problems with digestion and elimination. Check with your doctor regarding this.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Besides the gallbladder, there could be many causes for the pain you are experiencing. If the pain starts at the back and goes down to the front of the abdomen, it could most probably be a renal colic. This happens when urine is trying to pass through an obstruction usually a stone. But this pain is very severe and colicky. Other causes for pain could be peptic ulcer disease and GERD. You will need to consult your primary care physician for proper evaluation of pain and therapy.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I had my gallbladder out in 2008 (when I was 18).\u00a0\u00a0It took the doctors months to figure out what it was, but with a HIDA scan it said I had 0% function with no contractions.\u00a0\u00a0I had it taken out and was put on welcohl.\u00a0\u00a0My symptoms didn't go away and I still have sharp pains in my upper right side that sometimes last seconds or hours.\u00a0\u00a0They are not triggered by food and usually happen in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0I am very sensitive to food and it tends to go RIGHT through me.\u00a0\u00a0I have kept food journals and can not find a cause.\u00a0\u00a0I have also been tested for food allergies, chrones, and IBS and have been negative for all 3.\u00a0\u00a0I have also had an endoscopy and colonoscopy done with no results.\u00a0\u00a0I have had 2 appendix flair ups that have sent me to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0They said it was just inflamed and I did not need to get it taken out.\u00a0\u00a0I was told by a surgeon that he thinks my gallbladder failure was caused by something else and removing it was a quick fix that made things worse.\u00a0\u00a0I have been pushed from doctor to doctor with no results and I am so frustrated! Any ideas?",
