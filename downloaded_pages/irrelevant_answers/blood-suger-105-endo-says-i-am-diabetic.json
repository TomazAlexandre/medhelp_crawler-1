            "answer": "I am not a doctor so I can only speak from my own experience.\u00a0\u00a0The Diabetic Nurse who teaches the class I attend says that anyone with a fasting blood glucose between 70 and 120 is considered Diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0So according to what you say your level has been, (105) you would indeed be considered Diabetic if you were on my Health Plan.You do not say what the Endo doc said when you asked why he put you on the Metformin.\u00a0\u00a0I do not remember how much I weighed when I was first told that I was Diabetic - however I do recall that my blood levels were around 100.\u00a0\u00a0Having a family history of Diabetes can indeed be a major factor when a person turns out to be diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Both my parents have a family history of the disease.\u00a0\u00a0My father has it and many of his brothers & sisters also.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally one of my brothers and I are both diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0None of my other siblings have the disorder.\u00a0\u00a0Mother is not diabetic, however her brother is.Please speak with the Endo man again before you simply stop taking your meds.\u00a0\u00a0It may be possible that you are not Diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds though like you just do not want to believe that you are diabetic and are in denial like many people are when they are told they have any ailment.Do not be offended please, I pray that you are not Diabetic - however you need to verify the doctors findings before you simply stop taking your medication.\u00a0\u00a0There are indeed many restrictions being diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Please to not take to the river,\u00a0\u00a0De-Nile is not a good place to be.Best of Luck\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Anita",

            "answer": "Hi Venora & All\u00a0\u00a0.. another thyroid patient hoping NOT to be here but really don't know yet ..\u00a0\u00a0I had some bloodwork done for chem panel for muscle cramps in my calfs (calcium ck, etc.) done by my endo and all was fine on that end, but my fasting bloodwork came in at 126 ..... now there is one problem with this # ...... I did eat 1-2 cookies about 3 hrs before the test not knowing I was getting a fasting test .. otherwise (just cause so busy) I didn't get to eat/drink anything much that day so I know I didn't eat any real food and recall ingesting a cookie to tide me over along with little water (thinking oh no the blood test may be tough and cause I may be dehydrated) ....I remembered right before the test thinking it is almost a fasting test for the TSH T3 T4 draw so will be interesting to see how it compares to other TSH draws.I see my primary doc on Tues .. they'll redo the blood ... what do you think .. is 1-2 cookies 3 hrs before the test enough to mess up the end-result?I hope so.I am not in the mood to deal with this on top of my thyroid.C~TSH 1.788 Synthroid 75mcgs for the long haul as other side of thyroid is not working since partial thyroidectomy 1/07",

Let me (us) know how the test goes Chit...I have always been told that fasting blood test means nothing by mouth (except water) for 12 hours prior.\u00a0\u00a0But then, I have been proven wrong before, LOL LOL.\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck.AnitaPS: I refuse to belive I have a thyroid problem.\u00a0\u00a0One doc wanted to give me meds she said I would \"have to take for the rest of my life\".\u00a0\u00a0Saw an Endo man who said my Thyroid reading (?) goes up & down - no pill for me on that one.",

    "question": "Hi to allI finnally have gotten around to to ask why endo put me on metformin with and average reading of 105?I called my sis because my brother-in-law is diabetic. His blood sugar was over 360.I have been seeing this endo for almost 2 years for my throidlessness. I do not trust him any more as I am not diabetic.I feel he is out to more insurance money from Tricare the military insurance.I did take the metformn for about 2 weeks and I felt no different.I still had 105 averages.The highest it ever read was 134 after a pasta dinner.I am getting rid of the endo.I dont take the metformin.I am not diabetic. I am turning over all my medical issues over to my primary care doc\u00a0\u00a0at the base I am throidless, bi polar and I am not diabetic.Thanks for reading this. I felt like I just need to talk with others that have more experience with diabetesI do worry about getting diabetes as my paternal grandmother and my father both developed type II. ao I am watching my diet and loosing weight.I stopped drinking sodas diet and regular and I have dropped from198 to 185 in 2 weeks.So thanks again.Love Venora",
