            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.A disorder called fibromyalgia can produce these symptoms (tenderness). Sometimes repetitive injuries or strain can also produce these symptoms. Inflammation of the muscles, joints and surrounding soft tissues like bursa can also cause pain. They are diagnosed by a physical examination. Sometimes blood tests, x rays, bone scan, CT and nerve conduction studies can help clinch the diagnosis. Treatment usually depends on the cause and pain killers are given if the pain is severe.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "About 4 months ago I went in to my physician for UTI symptoms, tested positive and was treated with 7 days of Cipro followed by 14 days of Nitrofurnotion because the symptoms persisted.\u00a0\u00a0They never really felt like they went away.I also went on and off BC several times during this process and I realize my body may be totally out of wack.However, after antibiotic treatment I began developing other, seemingly systemic issues and can't find an answer for it.\u00a0\u00a0I've had persistent pain between my ribcage below my breasts, and body wide muscle twitching.\u00a0\u00a0I also have had joint tenderness in my hands and wrist.\u00a0\u00a0Other issues I've had are heart palpatations, blurry vision, fatigue, heaviness in the back of my head, random pings and pains all through my body.I've had bloodwork done to test for deficiencies, thyroid, diabetes, and anemia.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a head MRI, pelvic and abdominal ultrasound, and holter monitor test.\u00a0\u00a0So far-nothing except some sinus tachycardia.I'm at a loss for what to do next or what this could be.\u00a0\u00a0I am constantly having symptoms and am very afraid of what's happening.\u00a0\u00a0I had a neuro look at me to and he was so convinced from a physical examination that it wasn't ALS that he didn't want to put me through a painful EMG.Does anyone have experience with this? I have read so many things I'm considering fibromyalgia, celiac's, yeast overgrowth, parasite, reaction to medication, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Several people have mentioned anxiety but I truly don't believe it's possible for anxiety to have brought all of this on--especially since I wasn't having most of these symptoms until after the medication.\u00a0\u00a0I have days I'm just so scared that something really bad is happening to me and I just want to be a normal person again.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a 26 year old female if that helps alos.\u00a0\u00a0Any help would be greatly appreciated!",
