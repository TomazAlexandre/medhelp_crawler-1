            "answer": "Whew! You know how to ask a question, Pumpgirl! I have been scrambling to research answers for you, and the two may be tied. Try this link: http://www.bzs.org/Diabetes/pkids.shtmlThe site mentioned above tells of a 10-day-old boy who is thought to perhaps be the youngest diabetic pump user in the world. Now, within 10 days or so, he may be one of the youngest diabetics, also. When babies are born, blood work is routine, and diabetes could be discovered easily within days as the newborn's health is evaluated carefully, as apparently happened to the boy listed above.",

I watched that right after I posted the question. Weird haunh that I had my answer on the TV right after I posted the ? on the forum.I wanted to share that with everyone. I was shocked the symptoms that the baby had were just vomiting all her of her bottle up and she wasn't sleeping as well as she had before. Sounds like a hard pick-up if you ask me. Great of the parents to be on the ball like that.Also dad was a type 1 and maternal grandparents were type 2's so it wasn't like there wasn't a family history. But I can't imagine 5months I mean my mom had a hard enough time when I was 11 and I could verbelize my symptoms.Just thought I would share my latest knowledge with the rest of the diabetes community.Pumpgirl03",

            "answer": "Like Pumpgirl, I was older (age 12) when diagnosed. I, too, have tremendous respect for the parents of young babies that have diabetes before they can communicate when they feel bad. But the treatments have become so sophisticated that I feel their future looks bright. I have been diabetic 34 years and am healthy as a horse other than the daily insulin requirements and careful watch I keep on blood sugars. These little ones have so much more going for them than I did back in the dark ages, and if I can live healthily through all the ignorance of twenty years ago, they have even a better chance now.",

I developed hypothyroid disease at 7 yrs old and diagnosed when I was 8 yrs old. I began wearing the insulin pump in 1996, after being sick of taking 6-8 shots of insulin per day. Today, in 2009, I'm in good health with minimal diabetic complications. I was soo happy to see this sight and hear people discussing this subject.",

He stayed in the hospital initially7=8 days which should have been a warning sign and a great indicator. He was released and was having a lot of symptoms that mirrored Type 1 Juvenille symptoms. We kept going back to the hospital and even though we insisted something was wrong and specifically asked the doctor who delivered him when we went to the clinic for baby checkups and my wife to be checked up and the fact that my son didn't feel well the doctor was more concerned about birth control for some apparent reason and he worked in a Christian hospital. My son was finally after many trips to the hospital in very grave health and we insisted that he be hospitalized. The PA who admitted him didn't even come back to see him that night even though my son was suffering and in a state of grave illness. He finally saw the doctor in the morning after the hospital staff wouldn't even do anything for my sons suffering or symptoms. The hospital could not get any blood for a blood test when they finally figured out that he was in despair. We drove our son 3 1-2 hours without the staff telling us our sons sugar was 1097 and when we arrived 1109. My son suffered a stroke and was in a coma for 3 days his brain had swelled. He was finally released he now has hypothyriodism and had celiac disease and is on blood pressure medice to protect his kidneys. These complications were accelerated do to the initial care he received. I am refered to above as myself486.",

One thing my mom would tell me is that you have to be persistent when you feel something isn't right with your child and their diabetes.( She was refering to how scared she was raising me as a diabetic diagnosed at 9 months). It can mean life and death.You sound like your child had a close-call. It can be too close for comfort when things arn't right with your childs insulin regimin. Please keep being a sqeeky wheel when it comes to your DR and your child. Keep the DR aware of ANY changes you notice and send blood sugars via email to have responses sent back for adjustments needed without making a DR's appointment. I practice this now in my 36th year of JD.Take Care!",

            "answer": "Hi, everybody. These are amazing stories. Made me think of my mom. I think she is the greatest mom in the world. When I was 17 months old I got very sick with a cold. Since I wasn't getting any better my parents took me to the pediatrician. As soon as she saw me she said follow me to the hospital. I was diagnosed with diabetes. At that time (1964) doctors didn't know much about juvenile diabetes so they treated me as an adult. After 2 months in the hospital they told my parents that they couldn't guarantee that I would make it to 5 yrs old, but if I did the average lifetime for me was 20 yrs. That had to be the hardest thing for my mom to hear. Well, I'm 46 yrs old now thanking God every day for every new day I get. Growing up my sugar\u00a0\u00a0was always\u00a0\u00a0out of control but I was very healthy. Doctors could not\u00a0\u00a0understand. I had laser surgery back in 1991 for rethinopathy and my eyes are doing very well. Now, I'm ok but I was just diagnosed with celiac disease and gerd. So it's hard to find things to eat. No wheat, barley, pastas, caffeine, sugar fried and acidic foods. I also suffer of arthritis. But I still feel blessed by God. I try not to complain because I believe that things happen for a reason and there is always somebody in worst conditions. So everybody out there HANG IN THERE and try to have a positive attitude.oh, and have FAITH. (that's my secret formula)",
