            "answer": "What it'll do is cause your baby to crave sugars, after being born. That means basically that when you have him/her it's like cutting off the gravy train and the baby could deal with BAD hypoglycemia (you know what that is right?)So think of what happens when a person goes thru hypoglycemia, that's what happens to the baby. You should be trying your best to control your sugars. that means no more foods w/tons of sugar, or very little.Gest.
