            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you use computer a lot or read a lot then the symptoms of headache with dizziness or blackouts could be due to compression of the spinal nerves in the cervical spine region. This can also happen due to work involving straining of neck, herniated disc, canal stenosis, bone disease, spondylosis, poor posture etc. A MRI of the cervical spine and nerve conduction studies may be required. Please consult a neurologist. Even though you are young, get your blood pressure checked. This can also cause headache with dizziness. TMJ is another possibility. If you have been out in sun a lot or drink less of fluids then it can also be due to electrolyte imbalance or dehydration. Benign intracranial hypertension also causes dizziness with headache and a spinal tap is confirmatory. It can be a migraine attack too. But yes, all these causes should be evaluated. Discuss with your doctor. Take care!",
