I ate a whole refill pack of pez the night before I had to do my test. You'll do fine! Unless your super over weight most people don't have an issue with it. Plus my ob let me know that every time you pee in a cup they look to see if there is sugar in your pee, which is an early sign of gestational diabetes.",

            "answer": "I was petrified and it was actually nothing to be scared of. The drink is cold and tastes like orange watered down syrup. I took it at 8:30 am and was told not to drink of eat for an hour( dont eat anything with sugar before hand and u should have no problem). Than I went into my doctors office around 8:45 and they checked on baby and we discussed stuff and afterwards I went and they took 5 seconds to take a tube of blood and I didnt feel anything and had to ask her what she was going to do and she said \"All done\" lol I was done by 9:15am and through the whole process the only problem was my blood pressure was high because I was scared going in.",

            "answer": "I'm not even sure why they call it the \"hour\" test, that scared me as well. I drank my juice at home 30minutes before my appointment, went in and had a regular ob visit, then went to the lab and got blood drawn. I guess because you get your blood taken an hour after you drink the juice? I thought it meant they needed to do blood work for an hour.",

Every women has to do it, usually between 24-28 weeks although sometimes sooner based on personal circumstances (such as per pregnancy weight, family hx of diabetes, etc.). However thin people do get gestational diabetes as well, so don't assume you'll pass just because you're a healthy weight. It is called the one hour glucose tolerance test because your blood is drawn one hour after drinking the glucose drink. If you fail and have to do the three hour the draw your blood first, make you drink the drink, and then draw blood at specific time intervals throughout the next three hours. The purpose of the test is to see how your body responds to and processes a large amount of glucose.",
