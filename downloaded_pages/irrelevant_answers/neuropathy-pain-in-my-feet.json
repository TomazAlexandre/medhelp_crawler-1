            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Peripheral neuropathy pain is best managed by keeping the problem causing it under control\u2014diabetes, hypothyroidism, Vit B12 and folate deficiency, autoimmune disorders etc. Other than that it can also be pinched spinal nerve in lower back. At times cortisone injection, epidural injections, COX-2 inhibitors etc help. Surgery also may be required to relieve compression. It would be wise to reassess the case with a neurologist apart from taking medications. Physiotherapy and lumbar corsets also help a lot.Hope this helps. Take care!",
