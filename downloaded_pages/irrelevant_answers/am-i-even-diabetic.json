            "answer": "I am not a physician but a volunteer and the mom of type one diabetic, and the daughter of a type 2.\u00a0\u00a0You did not state which type of diabetes you have.If you have type 2 and have lost weight and exercise that would definitely keep your blood sugars lower. Also it depends on what type of foods you eat on how your sugar raises, and what type on insulin regimen you are on.You can be very luck y and be having a long honeymoon phase. As you sates you do not check your blood often, you could be high when you are not checking.I wish I could say we are in control with out that much effort, but being on the pump has helped tremendously.\u00a0\u00a0I do know of people that are able to maintain the numbers that you do, but there carbohydrate intake is so low that is sometimes a little scary as it is not always a balanced diet.",

    "question": "I havnt posted here since i was diagnosed, as i have been extremely stable and have had no problems. Ive now been a diabetic for three years.my progress has been extremely good. I have not had a major low, nor have i had a major high. The insulin im taking now is less then a quarter what i was taking when i was diagnosed and i can pretty much eat, do, drink anything without it making my sugar go high. If anything, my sugar is low. All my A1c's have been compeltly not diabetic, and it has all my docters scratching their heads wondering how im doing so good. I havnt been on a diet or eating plan for over 2 years, and i havnt really watched my eating like a normal diabetic should for the same amount of time. I guess all im wonderin gis whats up? My Blood sugar, although i rarley check it(bad i know) is never more then 5(canadian units), and is usually at about 4.0 (cutting it close i know) So i guess what i want to know is did i just get extremely lucky and am in an extreme honey moon that wont end? or maybe since i have gotten into better shape since my diagnosses (220 at the time, now 165 and in much better shape)So i guess my question is, is it normal to be able to eat 2 bowls of icecream and neve rhave ur sugar go over 5?( not that i do this often but i have tested recnetly) Is it possible that maybe since i have improved my physical well being i may have helped reduce the effects of diabeties? Or is anyone else on this board in a similiar situation of complete and full control, without any effort what so ever? any comment would be apperciated. Thanks",
