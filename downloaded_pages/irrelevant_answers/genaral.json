            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Dehydration is the commonest cause of high count. Drink plenty of fluids and repeat the test after a week. If it is still high, then it could be due to polycythemia vera, low oxygen in blood, or due to a heart condition. Diabetes too could be a cause.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
