            "answer": "Hi Luke,Congratulations on your marriage. You are wise to give serious thought to having children.I know several type-1 diabetic women who had good pregnancies and delivered healthy children. It does take very careful monitoring and tighter control than your wife might be used to. And, of course, pregnant women are strongly advised to not drink alcohol at all, whether or not they have diabetes.I'm not a doctor, but I can say that her doctor said the right thing. Typically a diabetic is advised to not get pregnant until her A1C is below 7 and she has a thorough physical to make sure that kidneys, eyes, etc. are all in good shape.I would advise that you know that you won't be able to control how your wife takes care of herself during a pregnancy-- all you can do is support her. Hopefully she will be successful in tight blood-sugar control and giving up drinking during the pregnancy.Here are a few links:http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/pregnancy-and-diabetes/DA00061http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/pregnancy-and-diabetes/DA00042http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/bd/diabetespregnancyfaqs.htm",

            "answer": "I too am a diabetic for 25 years and have had two healthy children ages 3 and 1.\u00a0\u00a0I agree with the above comments.\u00a0\u00a0Before we decided to get pregnant I got my health in order.\u00a0\u00a0I lost 10lbs., started walking everyday and made sure my hemoglobin A1c was under 7.\u00a0\u00a0I think this helped me to get pregnant quickly (my ob-gyn said it could take me 1-2 years to get pregnant--it didn't but I was mentally prepared.)\u00a0\u00a0I also started taking pre-natal vitamins.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure your wife is really ready for pregnancy.I had some difficult times when I was pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0It was not easy, worth it, but not easy.\u00a0\u00a0I had to be in very good control of my blood glucose levels.\u00a0\u00a0I was considered high risk, as all diabetics are and had to see my ob-gyn every two weeks and once a week from my fifth month on-also I had more ultra-sounds and pre-natal monitering.\u00a0\u00a0I had my thyroid removed during my first pregnancy(rare) and pre-eclempsia during both.\u00a0\u00a0I am not trying to scare you, just be aware that every pregnancy is hard, diabetics have it just a little harder.\u00a0\u00a0AND as I said before it was worth every minute because my children are very healthy, at birth they both weighed 7lbs--sometimes dr's worry birth weight will be alot because of diabetes and I was told it had alot to do with how healthy I was before and during my pregnancy.",

            "answer": "Hello everyone,I am also planning for pregnancy with Type 1 diabetes and am going to see a specialist on Tuesday, August 8th, 2006.\u00a0\u00a0I have been having a rough time lately, because one doctor I went to examined me and told me that I was pregnant but then called me the next day and the lab results were negative.\u00a0\u00a0It was a real disappointment because I have always wanted children and this had to happened.\u00a0\u00a0I have been a Type 1 Insulin-Dependent Diabetic now for seven years now and am on a insulin pump which is a genuine lifesaver and my overall blood sugar control is a little high above 7.5 but have been having good blood sugars from 50 to 212 lately which is good for me but now I'm tightening my blood sugars even more and taking every precautions.\u00a0\u00a0I have been checking my blood sugars every time before I eat, watch the carb intakes, test after I eat in case I have to make adjustments, take prenatal vitamins, folic acid, biotin (helps with blood sugar control), apple cider vinegar (also with blood sugars), black cohosh, vitamin C & D, and taking extra insulin when my blood sugar is high making corrections.\u00a0\u00a0Also, it helps to keep in touch with your doctor and let her know what your blood sugars are so they can make adjustments to your insulin dosages.\u00a0\u00a0Just a hint!! So far, I have been having good results but I need to tighten up my blood sugar control a lot more because the goal that I have set for the Hemoglobin A1C is 6.5 and below.\u00a0\u00a0Ever since my diagnosis, I have been in the high 9's, 10s, and even 11s but that was before I had the insulin pump now it is 7.5.\u00a0\u00a0I hope to get my blood sugar under control because of what I have read it helps to have a normal pregnancy which is what I want.\u00a0\u00a0I have also set up many other appointments to see a specialist that can help me even more by giving me suggestions and to examine me thoroughly before I begin my pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest anyone that is considering on planning a pregnancy to make sure that their blood sugars are under control before they consider because it will have an effect on the mother plus the baby!!***@****",

    "question": "My wife and I just got married and are beginning to consider children.\u00a0\u00a0She was diagnosed Type I at 16 or 17 and is now 23.\u00a0\u00a0She moniters it well but lives a unhealthy lifestyle (drinks).I'm just looking for some resources I can read about pregnancy and Type I and the risk involved.\u00a0\u00a0She's already spoken with her doctor who said they would have to work a bit more at getting her levels straight before she planned a pregnancy.Any advice/thoughts/links?\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks.",
