            "answer": "HiIt is difficult to diagnose a skin condition without examination. Since you have high cholesterol, it could be a cholesterol deposit called Xanthoma. \u201cA xanthoma looks like a sore or bump under the skin. It's usually flat, soft to the touch, and yellow in color. It has sharp, distinct edges.\u201d However these are usually pale yellow in colour and not red as in your case.\u201cThey may be a sign of a medical condition that involves an increase in blood lipids. Such conditions include: diabetes, primary biliary cirrhosis,certain cancers, inherited metabolic disorders such as familial hypercholesterolemia\u201d In your case it could be diabetes.Please consult a skin specialist and an Endocrine specialist. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else.",

    "question": "I have a unknown light red spot on the right lower side of my stomach. It is oblong in shape, 3 inches long, and 1 1/2 inches wide. It does not itch nor is it dry. It does not have a fever to it nor is it raised. I am not sure what it is however it seems to be growing slowly. My doctor said it may be just an alergy however for some reason this last time after my blood work my LDL level was very high 356 and HDL at 36 which shows a small problem with my liver. My sugar was up to 101 as well. I take cholesteral meds too. I am concerned. If you know the answer please help. Thank you.",
