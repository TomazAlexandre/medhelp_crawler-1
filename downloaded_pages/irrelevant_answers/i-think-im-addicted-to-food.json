            "answer": "Hi!First of all, consult a doctor to find out whether you have diabetes, hypothyroidism, anemia or other problems that is causing you to gain weight. Since you appear to eat several times in a day, keep a diary and note what you are eating. If you feel you cannot do this honestly, ask a friend to do this for you. This will tell you what you eat and remind you not to eat. You can set up alarms in your phone, laptop etc and only eat when the alarm goes. You could ask your friend to check on you. You need to change your lifestyle and keep healthy snacks at home. Take yup yoga, listening to music, doing deep breathing exercises etc to keep yourself calm. Take up any aerobic exercise of your choice. Apart from this, you need to undergo constant counseling. You may also need medications so, please consult a doctor specializing in eating disorders. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
