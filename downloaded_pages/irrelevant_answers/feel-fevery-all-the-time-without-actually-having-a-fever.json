            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Hyperthyroidism should be suspected in case of burning in eyes and hot and sweaty upper body. In females above 40 years it can be a symptom of menopause or premenopause. Peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes too should be looked into. Fibromyalgia is another possibility.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Unfortunately (becuase they don't know what's wrong) Hyperthyroidism and fibromyalgia have already been ruled out, and I'm only 29, so menopausal issues aren't applicable either. I've even gone off birth control to see if it was a hormonal imbalance, but still feel the same.",

    "question": "I feel hot and sweaty - particularly on my chest and head -\u00a0\u00a0and have burning eyes all the time. They thought I might have valley fever, but the test came back negative. I have had a battery of blood work done and everything came back normal. This has been going on for the past 1 1/2 years and is not a symptom of sever anxiety, for which I was just diagnosed. HELP!",
