            "answer": "Hello,Heart dilatation is called cardiomyopathy. Most of the time, the cause of the cardiomyopathy is unknown but some predisposing factors for it are long term high blood pressure, hereditary causes, heart tissue damage from a previous heart attack, chronic rapid heart rate, metabolic diseases like thyroid and diabetes, deficiencies of essential vitamins or minerals, such as thiamin (vitamin B-1), selenium, calcium and magnesium, alcoholism for years, abuse of cocaine or antidepressant medications, such as tricyclic antidepressants and some infections like streptococcal sore throat.Recent research has revealed that the possibilities of diabetes and heart disease are more in infants who are born premature like before 37 weeks of gestation.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
