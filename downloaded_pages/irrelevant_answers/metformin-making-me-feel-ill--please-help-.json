            "answer": "Metformin does have some fairly common side effects, mostly gastrointestinal. For some people these do subside as their bodies adjust. However, you are on a relatively low dosage so if these don't subside soon I'd see your doctor and perhaps he will switch you to something else. But I'm wondering also if some of the effects you are experiencing are caused by blood sugar fluctuations, especially feeling confused and weak and shakey. I would suggest you test your blood sugar when you have these feelings and see if it is out of range",

            "answer": "Side effects from Metformin are very common but rarely long lasting. Generally your body should adjust within a week or two and your tummy troubles should subside. There are several different medications available so you should discuss your symptoms with your doctor. You are not stuck with just one choice. Your doctor should have given you a test kit so that you can check your blood sugar. Monitor it regularly, as directed by your doctor or diabetes consultant. The best help you can give your body is to try to maintain a healthy weight and watch your diet carefully. Hang in there!",
