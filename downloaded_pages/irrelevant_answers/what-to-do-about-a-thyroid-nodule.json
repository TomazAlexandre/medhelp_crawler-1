    "question": "Hiall,I have a growing thyroid nodule: February 1.5cm April 2.7cm My endo put me on synthroid in February but the dose was too high ( TSH now 0.036uIU/ml). I had a biopsy on March but was inconclusive. Ultrasound showed calcifications, hence the biopsy.I have lost 10lbs since March! Had eye pain and palpitations.My endo seems to switch between \"let's wait and see' to 'let's do more tests' depending on my blood test results.Questions:Why did my vit D level drop dramatically?Why has my blood pressure dropped?\u00a0 90/60 at the momentShould I have another biopsy? - This is what he now wantsIf it is inconclusive again, what should I do?My endo also says I have pre-diabetes. Has anyone else got both thyroid and insulin resistance?I'm fit, exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet, not overweight ( quite thin) so the pre-diabetes is not related to bad health. I know I should go for another opinion but thought I'd ask you guys first.",
