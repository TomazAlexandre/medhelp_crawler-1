            "answer": "In my opinion, sounds like MAV (Migraine Associated Vertigo).\u00a0\u00a0I would seek another Neuro opinion since the first opinion was a \"joke\" and \"waste of time.\"I would recommend having Meniere's Disease and Vestibular Neuritis ruled out by the ENT Specialist.Make sure the ENT Specialist is competent in diagnosing and treating balance/inner ear disorders as all of them are NOT.What medications were prescribed for her?",

            "answer": "She should go to a diabetes specialist, this is because the tingling in her fingers may be from poor circulation, which diabetes does that.\u00a0\u00a0Also, if she indeed has a circulation problem, it can cause that sensation of nausea and also vertigo by not enough blood getting to the brain... altho an inner ear infection can cause nausea too, which the ENT can decide.\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, one of the posters here gave the idea about a compressed nerve, which if nerves that go from the cervical spine into the head and down into the arm are compromised, it can cause your wife's symptoms of vertigo and tingling fingers, in which case another poster's idea here about seeing a new neurologist is a good one... they may not have scanned her cervical spine and only did her head.One more point, an internal medicine physician group in town should be overseeing all her general health issues, they are excellent diagnosticians, and they can order all sorts of these tests, a one-stop overall doc, who may be able to narrow down what it is and refer her to the right people, instead of a hit-and-miss type of problem solving.\u00a0\u00a0And there is a forum somewhere in here for unexplained symptoms, I believe is the name of it, you could try copying your post over to there, too.\u00a0\u00a0Without my doing some research, I cannot say with any certainty what your wife is experiencing, but at least you did get some neurology people's responses on the issue.By the way, tell your wife when she gets that vertigo and undoubtedly feels unnerved by it, to take some really deep breaths, it helps reduce the sensation a few notches.\u00a0\u00a0And I want to emphasize that she should probably get a CT scan of her neck, and not just for a compressed cervical nerve, but also of the blood vessels that go up into the head... sometimes they can get a little blockage in there for some reason, too, and it can cause similar symptoms as your wife's.And thank you for serving, soon you will be coming home, I know it's hard when you know your family is having some problems while you're so far away.\u00a0\u00a0But if she can get hooked up with some internal medicine people, that SHOULD be as good as anything you might can do for your loved ones.",

    "question": "My wife, which is 25, has been having the following symptoms: tinnitus, vertigo, nausea, numbness in the finger tips, and Migraines.\u00a0\u00a0 In the beginning I took her to urgent care where the doctor diagnosed it as strictly Vertigo, then wrote her a prescription for it(one was a inflammatory and the other was basically motion sickness pills). So she used the meds and no results.\u00a0\u00a0Her and I met with the base PA the following week to discuss options.\u00a0\u00a0The PA really surprised me.\u00a0\u00a0He observed her, did the usual balance tests and said, you\u2019re getting an MRI.\u00a0\u00a0 Music to my ears.\u00a0\u00a0Well 4 days later she had her MRI and we waited until the PA received the results.\u00a0\u00a0The results came back normal, nothing.\u00a0\u00a0 I am thankful there is no mass, but still no answers.\u00a0\u00a0The PA then gave her a referral to see a neurologist which the appointment was yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0She came in, over heard the doctor and she guess's an intern in the other room discussing which one they would rather work on, a headache or Cerebral palsy. \u201c Cerebral Palsy.\u201d Moment later she\u2019s called into the room and the doctor does the balance tests, listens to her symptoms and says you have tinnitus and vertigo.\u00a0\u00a0DUH, that\u2019s why she is there.\u00a0\u00a0Then he sends her off with some meds and writes her a referral to see a ENT.\u00a0\u00a0 And that is where she is now, waiting to see the ENT.\u00a0\u00a0I would just like some insight as to what could possibly be causing this.\u00a0\u00a0Acoustic Neurosis and Cerebellitis were a few I have researched but I am not a physician.Symptoms: Tinnitus, sporatic loss of hearing in both ears,\u00a0\u00a0vertigo, numbness in fingertips, migraines, and nausea.The symptoms are gradually increasing.Family history: diabetes (she is pre-diabetic)I\u2019m sure there is more that eludes me.If there\u00a0\u00a0is any info needed to further Identify please inquire.\u00a0\u00a0I am deployed at the moment in Afghanistan and am very worried right now about her. Please help.Nick",
