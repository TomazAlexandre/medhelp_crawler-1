            "answer": "It's very important. If you do have GD it can cause your baby to grow abnormally to quick. The extra insulin you produce can cause your babies heart to thicken, which is like steroids. The baby will grow faster but the organs won't be developed enough. It's a very serious thing, please take the test. I have type 2 diabetes so I definitely know all about this cause I'm going through it. My daughter will be about 9 lbs when she's born but she is in good health because I've been trackin my sugars and seeing a specialist. Don't let it get to far! It's better to know even if it costs you the money.",

When i went tobmy first appt and the ob office gave me a payment thing that my husband and i couldnt afford bc our insurance is only 60% and they told me if i couldnt afford it to go to the area of the hospital where you pay bills for them (i dont remember the name) and apply for assistance. Thankfully we were approved for 100% so that is one HUGE load off our shoulders and i couldnt thank God enough for this. You could always try",
