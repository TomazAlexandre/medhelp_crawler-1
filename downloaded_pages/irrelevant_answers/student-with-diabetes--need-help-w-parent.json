            "answer": "It sounds like you are the type of teacher that goes above and beyond the call of duty for your students and I commend you for that.\u00a0\u00a0First of all, I am not aware of an enzyme that protects children up to puberty, but I do know that the better the control, the better the long term outcome for those living with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0In the short term, high blood sugars are having an impact on this little boy's daily functioning at school.Although your intentions are good, you are really powerless to a certain degree.\u00a0\u00a0My suggestion is to try to form an alliance with the Mom. Being the parent of an autistic child is challenging enough and adding the very detailed management of diabetes can be more than any one person or family can handle.\u00a0\u00a0This mother may feel overwhelmed, inadequate and guilty.\u00a0\u00a0Even though she may get some support at home, it may not be enough.\u00a0\u00a0She may view your questions as one more demand on her that she can't adequately fulfill.I would start by empathizing with her situation and asking if there is any way you might be of help while her son is at school.\u00a0\u00a0As a diabetic myself, I know how frustraing it is to keep blood sugars in control all the time.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, they go up fo no rhyme or reason and it has nothing to do with what you have or haven't done. When your blood sugars are high, you feel guilty even if you have done nothing that would casue it and you really don't want people asking you about it because you feel bad enough already.\u00a0\u00a0It is probably a million times harder for this mother because her son may not be able to communicate his needs with her or share in the resposbility of food choices, etc. He may not always be cooperative or easy to control and she is probably doing the best she can.\u00a0\u00a0I would spend your energy on letting her know how much you support and understand her situation and as she comes to trust that you are an ally of hers, she may be a little more forthcoming.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you and thank you for your efforts.\u00a0\u00a0Your students are lucky to have you for a teacher.Es",

            "answer": "I completely understand that this mom is overwhelmed.\u00a0\u00a0I can't imagine living in her shoes at all.\u00a0\u00a0Especially since she has another son who is in 4th grade with diabetes as well.\u00a0\u00a0Over the past year and a half, our team has been trying to support her and take as much of the burden off her while he is in school as we can.\u00a0\u00a0One of my aides is diabetic as well and has been for the past twenty some years, so she has alot more experience with this than I.\u00a0\u00a0She has been a godsend when it comes to this student.\u00a0\u00a0I would have thought knowing that there was someone working closely with her son who has diabetes and experience, it would make things easier on mom.\u00a0\u00a0Instead it seems as if she thinks we are against her when we ask questions.\u00a0\u00a0My aide says that if she knows what his morning numbers and what insulin he got, it would be alot easier trying to figure out what to feed him, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried talking to mom about this but she gets very defensive.\u00a0\u00a0It's not that we are trying to tell her she is doing anything wrong, because I don't know how I would do in her situation, we just want the information so we can all be on the same page.\u00a0\u00a0I am just very worried for this little boy.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors have told mom that something is protecting him until he hits puberty so I don't think she sees the urgency in keeping his numbers in check.\u00a0\u00a0From everything my team and I know, that's not the case and the high numbers he has (over 600 at times) is doing damage to him that can't be reversed.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your input.\u00a0\u00a0I'll keep trying to work with mom and I hope one day that she will see it's all about him, not her.",

            "answer": "What a great teacher & human being you are...I have also heard that children are blessedly protected from severe complications until puberty.\u00a0\u00a0I learned this from my sister (we are both diabetics) who's daughter was diagnosed at age 4.\u00a0\u00a0While it's surely a difficult row to hoe to have diabetes as a munchkin, at least there is a small comfort that the punishing complications that are associated with poorly controlled diabetes seem to be minimized during those years.My best guess is that the mom feels threatened by you in addition to being wrought with guilt that her children have this disease (most parents would eagerly trade places with their diabetic children if they could).\u00a0\u00a0Her whole life is likely consumed with diabetes issues -- or guilt about diabetes issues.\u00a0\u00a0Doing things for her children or feeling guilty about not doing enough.It seems as tho' she cannot \"hear\" your sincere compassionate help for what it is.\u00a0\u00a0You might ask your student directly and you can likely teach him to focus on the meter and learn to read the number.\u00a0\u00a0He may not understand the meaning of the number, but it could be a start to his participating in his own care.\u00a0\u00a0This is not trivial, even for a child without autism, however.One approach that she might embrace is for you to make the first step toward providing helpful communication.\u00a0\u00a0If you're not already doing this, perhaps you can send back & forth a small notebook in which you/the aide write relevant details of the student's day.\u00a0\u00a0High or low BG, time of day, symptoms, insulin, activities/events that might be related.\u00a0\u00a0YOu could ask her to jot down any notes she wants you to have and send the book back to school with the student.\u00a0\u00a0This idea is a variation of my sister's technique.\u00a0\u00a0They kept a notebook in the kitchen so that whether the babysitter, or my sister or her hubby or \"auntie\" was caring for the little girl, they'd all have access to the full information and they all were committed to putting relevant info in the book.\u00a0\u00a0In time, my niece became more responsible for putting info into the book, too.\u00a0\u00a0That book -- there were dozens of them filled thru the years -- was a priceless tool for both daily treatment mgt and also for spotting patterns ...Good luck and thank\u00a0\u00a0you so much for your involvement!",

            "answer": "Hello,I applaud you, as well.I am a mother of a 10 yr. old who was diagnosed with type 1 at age 3.I cannot even imagine how difficult this situation is for everyone involved.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone who posted gave you excellent advice.\u00a0\u00a0I can completely relate to the \"guilt\" thing.\u00a0\u00a0When my son has high blood sugar...sometimes without rhyme or reason like JDRF-Team-es mentioned, I feel guilty and responsible.I think the notebook idea was a great one.\u00a0\u00a0I am trying to put myself in the mom's situation considering I am a mother of a child with type 1, but it is hard for me because even when my boy was 6, I was the one who made sure the teacher knew what to do, what to look for, etc.My son went on an insulin pump a little over a year ago and it has helped us to get a better handle on his blood sugars, but he still has highs and lows.....that is what this disease looks like.\u00a0\u00a0There is only so much we can do.\u00a0\u00a0I do see your need to be invloved so that you can care for this child to the best of your ability.\u00a0\u00a0This is a tough one.\u00a0\u00a0I can see that her defensiveness stems from guilt.\u00a0\u00a0Not that she is doing anything wrong at all, but we feel guilty when our children have high blood sugar.Maybe you could approach the mom by telling her that you want to make sure that the care for him that you provide while he is at school is as thorough as the care she provides.\u00a0\u00a0Tell her that because she knows him the best, you just want to make sure you do the right thing and handle things as she would.You are definitely going above and beyond what I have experienced with teachers.Take care and post again if you have any news for us!SS",

    "question": "I am a teacher with a student who has diabetes and autism.\u00a0\u00a0I am very concerned about his numbers, because they are usually very high in the morning (over 350) and he has a very difficult time in school until his numbers come down.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried talking to mom about this but she is very defensive and does not share information readily.\u00a0\u00a0On the days he is very high, I ask her what his number was when she tested him and I get \"it was good\", \"I don't remember so it must have been good.\"\u00a0\u00a0Occassionally, I get a number.\u00a0\u00a0When I ask about how much insulin he got, I get the same run around.\u00a0\u00a0Without this information, I find it very hard to make sure his numbers don't go higher or bottom out.\u00a0\u00a0I am open to any suggestions as to how I can get mom to open up so we can help this student achieve all he can.\u00a0\u00a0He is a VERY smart little guy (6yrs old) and has a ton of potential but these high numbers are throwing him totally off.\u00a0\u00a0I did talk to the nurse at his doctor who told me that kids have an enzyme that helps protect them until puberty.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone knows about this, I would be interested as I can't find anyone else (drs., nurses) that have ever heard of this.\u00a0\u00a0Any help would be appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0I am very worried about long term problems for this child.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!",
