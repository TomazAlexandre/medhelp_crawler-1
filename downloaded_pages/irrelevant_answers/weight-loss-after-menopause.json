            "answer": "Hi!Well if you have not been over eating or consuming high calories and not been exercising less or if there is no change in your routine or if there is no new medication that you have started, then you need to find the cause of weight regain and problem shedding weight. Diabetes, hypothyroidism or adrenal gland problems are the commonest causes of weight gain. Cushing\u2019s syndrome should be looked for. Another is water retention due to low serum protein. This along with anemia can cause unexplained weight gain. The kidney function too should be assessed. Late night snacking and poor sleep too can cause weight gain. Polycystic ovary too causes weight gain, hence has to be ruled out by an ultrasound of abdomen.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!",

    "question": "I have just recently \"finished\" meanopause, well, most of the symptoms are gone and I've \"flatlined\" out hormonally, which is fine with me, but after losing about 20 lbs last year, I have hit the wall and no matter what I do, I can't lose any more weight. Work out 4-5 times a week and have been FAITHFULLY following Weight Watcher since Jan 7th.\u00a0\u00a0Initially lost 5 lbs but have rapidly gained back 3, without a single change to my diet or exercise patterns. My dr is on my case every time I see her because I am not losing weight fast enough for her---and of course she does not believe me that I am seriously working on this. I was planning on having a tummy tuck and some serious liposuction this March, but my BMI is too high for the dr to feel comfortable doing the surgery. I had 5 c-sections, all done vertically, so the scar is horrific looking. My belly (pannus) hangs way down in front and is visible through all of my clothing Stretch marks from knees to neck, too..I am disgusted by how I look and although I lift weights and work out, the belly is hanging lower and looking worse, but I am not losing weight. I'd be thrilled with a half pound a week loss, if it were consistent, but I simply have hit a brick wall. Any help would be appreciated.",
