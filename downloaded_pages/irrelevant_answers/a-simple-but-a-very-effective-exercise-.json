    "question": "JIN\u00a0\u00a0JI\u00a0\u00a0DU\u00a0\u00a0LIJUST A SIMPLE BUT A VERY EFFECTIVE EXERCISE !The essence of the exercise is that your \"Eyes Must be Closed\" when you are doing this exercise. You must practise the \"Jin Ji Du Li\" exercise with the eyes closed. This exercise was so simple and amazing that I thought I had to share it here.Here is the exercise:Stand on one leg while your eyes are closed. That is all. Just try it right now, stop reading and stand up, close your eyes and try standing on one foot.If you are not able to stand for less than 10 seconds, it means that your body has degenerated to 60 to 70 years old level in other words, you may be only 40 years old, but your body has aged a lot faster.I tried this exercise myself when I read the mail. I thought \u201coh, big deal, I\u2019m sure I can do this easily\u201d I was fooling myself, I\u2019m glad I tried it because I discovered much to my surprise that while I could stand easily on one foot with my eyes open, trying the same thing with my eyes closed was another story! I just could not keep my balance for more than two to three seconds before I started wobbling and hopping around.You do not need to lift your leg high, if your internal organs are out of synch, even lifting your leg this bit will make you wobble.Now this was quite scary because it told me that my body was almost 60 years old and here was me, barely into my forties! These Chinese are really very advanced in their knowledge of the human body. It was very heartening to know that frequent and regular practice can help you recover your sense of balance. In fact Chinese specialists suggest daily practice of Jin Ji Du Li for 1 minute, this helps prevent dementia.You can try slightly closing both eyes while practicing Jin Ji Du Li, instead of completely closing them; in fact this is what the health specialist Zhong Li Ba Ren recommends.Daily practice of Jin Ji Du Li, can help in healing many illnesses or diseases like\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0Hypertension,\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0High Blood Sugar or diabetes,\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0Neck and Spinal diseases,\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0it can also prevent you from getting dementia.Zhong Li Ba Ren has written a book titled \"Self Help is Better than Seeking Doctors' Help\", which is a bestselling book that has been the best seller health book in China since it was first published last year. Its success can be measured by the fact that it has been reprinted 12 times within 6 months, with more than 1 million copies sold. The book is a hot seller because is it teaches many simple practical health tips.It is said that according to the understanding of Chinese physicians, diseases appear in the body because the coordination between the various internal organs encounter problems and that causes the body to lose its balance. Jin Ji Du Li can readjust this inter-relationship of the organs and how they function with each other. Zhong Li Ba Ren stated that many people can't stand on one foot with their eyes closed for even 5 seconds, but later on as they practice it daily, are able to stand for more than 2 minutes.As you gain ability to stand for longer time, the feeling of \"head heavy, light feet\u201d disappears. As benefits or practicing Jin Ji Du Li, you will experience that the quality of sleep improves, the mind clears up and memory improves significantly. Most importantly if you can practice Jin Ji Du Li with your eyes closed for 1 minute every day, you will not get dementia.(I think it this also means the brain will remain healthy).Zhong Li Ba Ren explained that there are 6 important meridians passing through our legs. When you stand on a single leg, the weak meridian will feel sore while getting the necessary exercise, and as this happens, the corresponding organs of these meridians and their path-ways, start getting the necessary tuning. This method can focus or concentrate the awareness, and channel the body's qi to the foot. The beneficial effects of practising Jin Ji Du Li on various illnesses associated with hypertension, diabetes, neck and spinal diseases are quick to be seen and felt. Jin Ji Du Li can also prevent gout.Jin Ji Du Li helps to Strengthen body Immunity rapidly.Jin Ji Du Li it is suitable for everyone generally. It is the basic cure for \"Cold Feet Disease\u201d and it can also strengthen the body\u2019s immunity. You do not have to wait until you have any illness to start practicing Jin Ji Du Li. It is especially beneficial for young people, when they practice it daily while they are healthy, so that their chances of contracting the various illness associated with aging is comparative lower.Please note that it is not suitable for people over 70 years old, or those old people whose legs are not strong and cannot stand steadily.",
