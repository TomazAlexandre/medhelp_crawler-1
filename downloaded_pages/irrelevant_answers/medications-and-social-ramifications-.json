            "answer": "Well, CJ, you can take your opinion and...ETCH IT IN STONE TABLETSbecause that's pretty much what gets the job done -let the meds turn the heat down while the therapy gets to the fuel source. The blood pressure example is valid, as would be control of diabetes and many other medical conditions.All that said, meds can be hell, no doubt about it and sometimes getting the right adjustment can take time and be a real burden. Likewise, the therapy may take you places you'd rather not go, mentally, so adjustments can be in order there as well. But a negative experience either way should not be controlling on the over-all strategy and the goal of recovery.Good post, well said.",

            "answer": "**appluading**\u00a0\u00a0GREAT post!I honestly do not think there is too much of a social stigma or ramifications when it comes to taking SSRIs or AD's...I actually feel it's become almost fad-ish....and feel that they are over-prescribed in a lot of cases.Benzos...there still is somewhat of a stigma and controversy, especially with the docs.\u00a0\u00a0But, the way I look at it is....I'm going to do what I need to to get well....and the h*** to what anyone else thinkgs about it.\u00a0\u00a0Now, for someone more sensitive and worried about it...to ME, the simple solution is that it is just not anyone else's business unless you choose to share.\u00a0\u00a0I would never ask someone out of the blue what meds they took for diabetes, high BP, thyroid, etc...so I wouldn't ask about anxiety, depression meds either.But...great post, cj....if someone needs help...they need help....and I wish they would just get that help with a completely open mind....whatever it takes, it takes.\u00a0\u00a0There is NO shame in either meds, therapy or both, in my opinion.",

    "question": "often get messages and questions about my opinions of seeking help through medication and the social ramifications of doing so.\u00a0\u00a0While everyone is different and there is no unique way to beat anxiety and panic, in my personal experience, there are different ways to confront this.\u00a0\u00a0Let me stress, I am not a doctor and I applaud people who choose not to use medication in dealing with this; that is a personal choice and I commend people for making a decision to do so.When I first had a panic attack three years ago and realized that this was becoming a problem, I was VEHEMENTLY against any forms of medication to deal with this.\u00a0\u00a0I was concerned about the social ramifications and the fact that I may need help from meds to help me through this.\u00a0\u00a0Obviously, I had a change of heart and as many know, I am a proponent of medication COMBINED with talk therapy.This combination, in my experience, is the most important point.\u00a0\u00a0Without confronting why this pattern of behavior exists, it is much harder to break through this cycle.\u00a0\u00a0Talk therapy is the most important step in beating this; not medication.\u00a0\u00a0But, as a tool, it has and does help me through all of this.\u00a0\u00a0I think of it this way; if I had high blood pressure, I would take medication; however, there are also many steps that I must take along this road to managing it.\u00a0\u00a0I would change my diet, get regular exercise, and lose weight if I needed to.\u00a0\u00a0Would I necessarily like doing all of this?\u00a0\u00a0Nope, I would wish I could just take a pill and let it be over with, but that is not how life works.\u00a0\u00a0There are many things we can do to control it, just like with anxiety and panic.The social ramifications about Antidepressants and benzos really do not concern me any more.\u00a0\u00a0If you take them, you have basically accepted there is a problem that must be confronted.\u00a0\u00a0For me, that takes much more courage than pretending a problem does not exist.\u00a0\u00a0During this process, I had also found that my boss was on an SSRI along with many of my coworkers; when I opened up about it, it also relieved a lot of stress that I had been carrying on my shoulders.Again, this is just my opinion and everyone deals with problems in their own unique ways, but I just want to say that just by being in this forum and sharing your fears and concerns, shows me every member in here has nothing to be ashamed about.",
