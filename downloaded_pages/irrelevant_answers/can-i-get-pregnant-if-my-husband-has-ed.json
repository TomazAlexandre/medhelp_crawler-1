We talk openly about wanting to have a baby... and he knows that is all riding on him, which is way too stressful for us both.\u00a0\u00a0We also cannot afford insemination.\u00a0\u00a0I have no answers - in fact I stumbled upon your post looking for answers myself, but I just wanted you to know that you're not alone.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I'm not a religious person, but I decided to just give it up to God, and if we are meant to have a kid, it will happen... I don't know how to deal with this otherwise.\u00a0\u00a0We've been to therapy, he's been to a ton of doctors and the urologist and no one has answers... so I'll just pray for help, and will do the same for you.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you so much luck, and hope that you two can figure out a way to be truly happy together, come what may.",

            "answer": "Hi Wife, OK his diabetes, is it 1 or 2, if its 1 then so to say not a lot of hope, now ifits 2 then there is some scope, with to he can do it with a diet, if he stays on meds then its them thats giving him ED its the side effects, but if I remember right then he could try trimex shots, these he injects into his p***s, you need to be a real man to do that.Stress is a big sex killer, so you need to find a way of getting that down, so first fighting ED brings on stress anyway, but if its his work then he needs to deligate more and shift his load unless hes the boss, if he is the boss then the same things apply, shifting his load to calm him down, at home make sure when he walks through the door his work stays outside, make it a rule that all work stays outside, inside soft music, soft lights and a very calm atmosphere, this way you can bring his stress down, no alcohol, if he has a weight problem then he needs to get that down, and if he dosent exercise then he needs to.Now thats my view, so just how dose this come into anything your doing now? or what you've been told to do.Hope it helps.Good Luck",

    "question": "Hi, I am 31 years old and my husband is 33. We just got married about 8 months ago. We would like to have a baby. However, since we got married, we have had sex maybe half a dozen times. He has a small penis, which I can except because he is a wonderful man. However, when we do have sex, he loses his erection shortly into the act and can only orgasm if I perform oral sex on him. Needless to say, this is detrimental to my self-esteem, and I am CONSUMED with worry that I will not ever get pregnant because of this. To me, it feels like my husband is not attracted to me at all and it just kills me. I can't tell you how much I've cried over this. It's just gotten to the point where I do not want to have sex with him at all because it is such a depressing, humiliating and embarrassing experience. I mean, I am not the best looking woman in the world, but I have never had any trouble in the bedroom. I've put on fifteen pounds over the last 7 months as a result of this. We can't break up because we are married, and he is a very nice man. I would not be likely to find another man as nice as he is. But this is a huge problem for me. Please, please help!!! What can I do? We can't afford insemination - if we can just have a baby, I think I could manage the rest of my life without sex.......",
