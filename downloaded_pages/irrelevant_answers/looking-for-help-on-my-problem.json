    "question": "Hi, I am an 18 year old female; with a normal activity level and normal weight. For the last year or so I have been expierencing what I call random pain spasms through out my body. When I first started having them it was only near my wrists then the spasms moved to my hands, arms, legs, around the knees, feet and rib cage. Its not a muscle spasms, its more along the line of like a bone or nerve not sure which but they can be extremly pain full at times and usually last only a couple seconds at a time. I do have some health problems but nothing that would cause this to happen as far as I have found out; I am have a heart valve with an issue but not serious and knee trouble. Neither of which I can spell though I do know what those are. The valve was discovered after the pain spasms started; I have been tested for lymes diease, diabetes, and a few other things all coming back negative. The only option I was giving was to go see a Neurologist, which was impossible up in till recently and I am yet to go see one. I know it has nothing to do with my spine because even going to a chiropracter several times a week does not make them go away. I can go days without haveing any then the next day have muliple. I really wish to at least have some clue to what I have been going through. If you have any thoughts or ideas please let me know.",
