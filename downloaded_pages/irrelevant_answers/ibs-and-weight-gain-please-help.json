            "answer": "Hello - thanks for asking your question.Fluctuating weight is a possible symptom of IBS. Patients with IBS also frequently complain of abdominal bloating and increased gas production in the form of flatulence or belching. However, these symptoms occur despite normal volumes of gas in the gastrointestinal tract and no significant increase in colonic distension.However, an acute weight gain of 20 lbs is significant, and other causes of this should be sought before attributing it to IBS.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to discuss the following causes of weight gain with your personal physician: diabetes, depression, kidney failure, hypothyroidism, smoking cessation, or Cushing syndrome to name a few.A reasonable next step would be a screen for other causes (i.e. diabetes, thyroid or kidney dysfunction) to make sure it isn't the cause of the weight gain.I also looked up the medication you were taking - weight gain does not appear to be a side effect.I strongly suggest continued followup with your personal physician.I stress that this answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Thanks,Kevin, M.D.",

THE FIRST THREE I WOULD RECOMEND WOULD BE\u00a0\u00a0THYROID SCAN WITH CONTRAST TO RULE OUT THYROID DISEASE,COLONOSCOPY ,AND UPPER SCOPE TO RULE OUT ANY SERIOUS DIGESTIVE PROBLEMS .THE COLONOSCOPY COVERS ALL OF THE LOWER DIGESTIVE SYSTEM THEY MAY SUGEST BARIUM ENEMA BUT IT IS SIMPLY A CHEAP VERSION OF THE COLONOSCOPY AND HAS BEEN KNOWN TO MISS MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS (IT DID WITH ME!!!!) HAVE YOU BEEN HAVING PAIN IN THE\u00a0\u00a0LOWER LEFT OR RIGHT CLOSE TO PELVIC AREA, CONSTIPATION ,DIARRHEA,BLEEDING ,WHAT FILLS LIKE CONTRACTIONS IN YOUR STOMACH,RECTAL BLEEDING,PASSING BLOOD WITH STOOL,UPPER GASTRAL DISCOMFORT(PAIN OR BLOATING),GERD LIKE SYMPTOMS(CONSTANT HEART BURN),CONSTANT BACK PAIN ,ETC.?????REPLY BACK WITH THE ANSWERS TO THIS AND I MAY BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU SOME IDEA AS TO WHAT MIGHT BE GOING ON . GOD BLESS WISHING YOU WELL",

            "answer": "I would also ask the doctor to do an abdominal scan to check your liver for fatty infiltration.\u00a0\u00a0I was told years ago that I had IBS.\u00a0\u00a0But like the other person said---the doctors like to say you have IBS when they can't figure out what your real problem is.\u00a0\u00a0It is hard for a good doctor to keep up with all of the research and the changes that take place in the medical field.\u00a0\u00a0It took me years and years to find out that I have a liver problem (NASH) and I am pre-diabetic (insulin resistant).\u00a0\u00a0I have been tested extensively at the National Institute for Health.\u00a0\u00a0I also have hypothyroidism.Having your thyroid checked is a good idea.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor can give a prescription for that and it isn't even expensive.",
