            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you have missed your periods, then take a pregnancy test and see. Otherwise, this could be due to chronic fatigue syndrome. This usually presents with widespread myalgia (muscle ache) and arthralgia (bone and joint ache), headaches, chronic mental and physical exhaustion, cognitive difficulties, concentration difficulty and memory problems. Cognitive behavior therapy, memory games, multivitamin therapy, nutritional care, graded increase in exercise all help to treat it. There is no cause for this.Then you also need to investigate other causes like liver dysfunction (get liver enzymes done\u2014liver function test), kidney dysfunction (get kidney function test done), and anemia. Poor sleep pattern and sleep problems like sleep apnea too can cause brain fog. Sleep studies by sleep specialists can help diagnose this. Low Vit D or Vit B12 too could be the cause. Hypothyroidism, diabetes and hormonal imbalance in women due to either menopause or any other cause like PCOD should be investigated.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
