            "answer": "Don't feel too bad. I'm also one who doesn't usually get sick. With both of my first 2 I was sick literally every 2 weeks for a good couple weeks. Even after I had the babies I still got sick a lot. Your immune system get so low when you are pregnant. I'm convinced that the only reason why I haven't been sick this time is because we moved to the middle of no where so I don't really see anyone, at least if they are sick.I do have a couple suggestions for things you can try, one that I will swear by. The first thing is a simple honey and lemon tea. All I do is heat up some water squeeze/pour lemon juice into the water and add in honey. I do both to taste. It gives a really nice sweet and sour flavor if you do it in right proportions. It takes a little trial and error to get the flavor the way you like, but if you drink it at the first sign of a cough/sore throat, it will get rid of it. I do it twice a day until symptoms are gone. For a sore throat it's usually the next day, for a cough it may take a couple.The other thing is using a Neil Med netti pot. If you haven't used it, it is just a nasal saline. I prefer the bottle over the actual pot because if your nose is really stuffed, it gets through better than the pot. You can squeeze the bottle at the rate you need rather than hoping the pot will spill and go where you need it. The trick with it is to make sure your head is tipped far enough forward so it comes out the other nostril, rather than going down your throat. You want to do that at the first sign of a cold as well.Between those two if you try them, hopefully they will help! Best of luck!!",
