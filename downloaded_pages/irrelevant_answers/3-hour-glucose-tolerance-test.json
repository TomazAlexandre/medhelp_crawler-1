            "answer": "Thank you!\u00a0\u00a0I wasn't sure and they have to wait for the patologist to interpret it. I was mostly worried because mine dropped so much from the second to third hour. Now I know why I felt like I was going to pass out on my way home!Sorry to hear that you did not pass!\u00a0\u00a0At least it goes away once baby is born. Are they just having you control it with diet or do you have to take insulin?",

            "answer": "Your numbers are supposed to be UNDER the max.\u00a0\u00a0I would be worried if they went OVER not under. This is a general idea of what they go by.Results of three hour glucose tolerance testGestational diabetes will be diagnosed if two of the following values are exceed the normal limit.Fasting - 95 mg/dL1 hour - 180 mg/dL2 hours - 155 mg/dL3 hours - 140 mg/dLMany times if you DO fail 2 out of the 4 they will repeate the test to make sure.\u00a0\u00a0But not all doctors will do that.\u00a0\u00a0The numbers you listed above show that you only exceeded the limit on ONE of the blood draws.\u00a0\u00a0That sounds good.\u00a0\u00a0I had to do the 3 hr this time and my doc never gave me my numbers just told me that I was \"borderline\" and to watch my sugar and starch intake...no insulin, no more tests, no strict diets....I wouldn't worry til you hear from your doctor.",

    "question": "I had my 3 hour glucose test on Saturday, becasue of course I failed the 1 hour one.\u00a0\u00a0I called the docs office and they said that they would have my results for 2 or 3 more days.\u00a0\u00a0I then called the lab that did my blood work and they gave me my numbers.\u00a0\u00a0After fasting for twelve hours it was 76, the max was 95 so that was good.\u00a0\u00a0One hour after I drank the glucose stuff it was 123, the max being 180.\u00a0\u00a0At two hours it was 181, max being 155. The third hour it was 38 the max being 140.My blood sugar dropped from 181 to 38 in one hour.\u00a0\u00a0That is almost 150 points and seems very wierd to me and my mom almost had a cow that it was that low.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if any of you know but does that sound way too low to anyone?\u00a0\u00a0Do you think that I failed and have gestational diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Any insight would be appreciated!!Thank you!",
