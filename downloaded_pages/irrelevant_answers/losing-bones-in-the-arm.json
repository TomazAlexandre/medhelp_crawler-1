    "question": "My dad has Diabetes type 2 (the one he doesn't use an insulin but takes medications, thats type two right?).About the same time, he found out he had it, he also developed this pain in his right arm. Im almost 100% sure that this is completely irrelevant, that it just happen to coincide. So basically, his arm really hurts sometimes. If you feel it, its like jelly, as if there is no bone there.He went to the doctors, I think the doctor prescribed some medication, rub, and some exercises. He's not doing the exercises because he thinks there useless, (and I think it would hurt for him to lift a dumbbell with that arm too) .So I want to know, what exactly is wrong? My dad loves milk, drinks milk all the time, so I dont think it's a protein or calcium deficiency. It seems as if the bone is not there, its all jelly. If you squeeze his other arm, there is a stark difference in the composition; one is firm, the other is flabby.I'm really worried, It might be related to diabetes...any idea's? I'm not sure if anything happened to cause this, but my question is: how do you cure it? My dad like doesn't believe in doctors, takes their advice very lightly. Should he start taking vitamins? Would dumbbells really help?Thanks in advance.-Worried 14-year old son",
