    "question": "I am 59 years old, 5 years postmenopausal lady. I was on HRT for5 years. On June 20, 2001, I had a lumbectomy and axillar lenphadenectomy. 1,5 x 1,5 x 2 cm. tumour was removed with 15 axillary nodes. Surgical margins were clear and 1(one) lenf node(in level 1) was involved with an invasion to its own capsule. Pathology is invasive ductal carcinoma, histologic grade 2. ER and PR were positive. Her2 was also slightly positive. My own oncologist advised 4 AC + Radiotheraphy + Tamoxiphene.But I have heard that some doctors add 4 Taxol, even with\u00a0\u00a0Herceptine as an adjuvant chemotheraphy after 4 AC + RT.Is that a trial procedure or a standart regime in some medical schools? Is that worth taking Taxol and Herceptine after 4 AC + RT in my conditions in my age? I have not any other systemic disorders like heart disease, Hypertension, Diabetes, or Obesity.Thank you.",
