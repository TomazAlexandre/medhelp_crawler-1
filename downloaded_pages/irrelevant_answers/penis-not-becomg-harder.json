            "answer": "Hello,This blood can be due to trauma to the penis. Non erection of the penis can be due to some nerve damage or nerve compression which can result in difficulty in getting and maintaining an erection. Other conditions to be considered are diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions and poor circulation. But these seem to be less likely in your case. I suggest you to consult a urologist to assess the damage done to the urethra and penis.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
