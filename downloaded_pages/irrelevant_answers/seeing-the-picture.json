            "answer": "You don't say if you have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Fuzzy vision is a symptom of high blood sugar and will usually resolve when the blood sugar is under control. Some people also get temporary visual effects when they have low blood sugar. If you are diabetic, you should have an eye exam once a year to make sure there are no more serious problems with your eyes which can result from blood sugars that are out of control for a period of time.",
