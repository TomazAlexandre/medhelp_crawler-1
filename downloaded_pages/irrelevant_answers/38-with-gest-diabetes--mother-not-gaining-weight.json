            "answer": "I had gestational diabetes in my last pregnancy (and this one) and I stayed the same weight basically from the second trimester onwards.\u00a0\u00a0For me, it was because I was following a healthy diet.\u00a0\u00a0I was definitely eating less fat and no refined sugar or flour, but lots of fruits, veggies, meats and healthy carbs.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor wasn't concerned and my baby was born healthy.\u00a0\u00a0So I guess the question would be -- has she changed her eating habits?\u00a0\u00a0And if so, is it for the better?",

            "answer": "Hi,as long as the baby looks fine and your wife is eating a healthy diet with plenty of protein, healthy fats, and veges there is no need to worry about weight gain (or lack of).\u00a0\u00a0I am also diabetic and now 26 weeks and have only gained about 3 kg so far.Most important for the baby is that her blood sugars are very well controlled.My Obe doesn't worry about lack of weight gain as long as the mother is eating well.\u00a0\u00a0She told me she has had patients gain no weight and deliver perfectly healthy babies, and other gain heaps and still the baby does not do so well.Best wishes to you and your wife.",

    "question": "My wife is 7 mths pregnant at 38.\u00a0\u00a0She has been diagnosed with gestational diabetes in the last few months, and has been taking insulin.She hasn't really gained any weight at all- she was 57kg before pregnancy and now she is 61kg.\u00a0\u00a0She went for a check yesterday as she was worried about what was probably Braxton-Hicks symptoms, and the doctor said the baby looks fine and is a normal weight, but he didn't know why my wife hasn't really gained anything.\u00a0\u00a0People say that she looks like she has lost some weight.Is this something to panic about?\u00a0\u00a0I know most places say the mother should gain weight, and I'm worried it will hurt her and /or the baby.Just to say, also, we live in Thailand (my wife is Thai, me English) and though the doctor seems competent, I'm not 100% sure he is.",
