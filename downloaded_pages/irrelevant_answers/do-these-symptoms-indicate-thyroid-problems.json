            "answer": "What are your Thyroid blood labs?Are you taking muscle enhancing meds such as DHEA?DHEA in larger doses can cause lots of side effects.\u00a0\u00a0Doses for daily use should be no more than about 5 mgs.\u00a0\u00a0And even then it is recommended to take a day or 2 off between doses.\u00a0\u00a0Many body builders will take 25 mgs or more which can cause all sorts of side effects.Many of the symptoms you list are associated with Thyroid problems.\u00a0\u00a0However several you list are contradictory. Meaning that they would generally be associated with both high AND low Thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0This can happen with Hashimotos disease but usually the swings are on the order of days or weeks or even months swinging between high and low.The true body you really want to build is a healthy one.\u00a0\u00a0If whatever you are doing is making you sick it is not worth it in the long run.\u00a0\u00a0Just my opinion.",

            "answer": "Many body builders take DHEA.\u00a0\u00a0That is why I asked.\u00a0\u00a0Many teenagers across the country take DHEA to enhance muscle. The US Congress has discussed banning DHEA as a steroid for prescription only.\u00a0\u00a0But currently you can get this over the counter making it easy for teens and others to obtain it and take it without proper guidance by a Dr.\u00a0\u00a0My only concern was to make you aware of the potential danger associated with this IF you happen to have been taking it.I think you need to go to the Dr. and get blood tests to help you determine what might be wrong if anything.",
