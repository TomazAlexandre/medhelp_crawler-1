            "answer": "I have read other articles that discuss more allergy issues with Humalog than with Novolog. But as LRS has written, each person is different, and there really IS no set standard that is perfect for each person. With this disease, some trial and error is absolutely necessary in order to discover what works best for the individual. Furthermore,I want to point out that while Forum-vol-cmb finds that one unit of insulin per 12 grams of carbohydrate is perfect, this ratio is certainly individual, and every person has his or her own proper insulin-to-carb ration. Even as an identical twin, my ratio is different from my twin's. So don't take those numbers as some sort of standard dose for a \"normal\" diabetic person.",

The Humalog worked pretty well for me,but when i switched to a pump, my doctor had me try Apidra and it's really worked great. My blood sugar comes down a lot faster with the Apidra and it keeps my post meal readings pretty good too....",

    "question": "I have type 1 diabetes. I have been diabetic for over 10 years. I started controlling my blood sugar using Regular insulin\u00a0\u00a0About 3 years ago, my doctor moved me to humalog. Using humalog was not easy. I looked at the study that was done and it never reacted as expected when I used it. It was taking 2 hours to start working and in by the third hour my glucose level would drop 200 to 250. It was also hard for me to sense when my blood sugar is low. That was very frustrating. After six month of roller coaster, my doctor put me on Novolog. When I started using Novolog, with in two hours of eating my blood sugar gets back to normal range.\u00a0\u00a0I can sense better if my blood sugar level starts to drop below 60. And I don",
