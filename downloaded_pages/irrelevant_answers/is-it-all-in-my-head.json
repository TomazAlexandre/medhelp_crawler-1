            "answer": "Well, JustTired_3, I think you have a complete iron panel and at the same time explain to your dr. the fainting episode.You would want to address any serious underlying issues, right?You should also rule out hypoglycemia.For now, try to optimize your diet and do include some red meatfor iron. Eating small frequent meals will help with any hypoglycemic symptoms.Lowering stress levels will also help, as stress is not only an emotional/mental issue, but also physical.Stress produces toxins and invites disease.Just search under Dr. Gabor Mate, author of:\"When the Body Says No: Understanding the Stress-Disease Connection\".Best wishes,Niko",

            "answer": "You have had a syncope or fainting attack and this is usually brought about by low blood pressure and/or anaemia. This is certainly not all in your head. Your unexplained weight loss is also worrying.There are too many possibilities to mention but hyperthyroidism, diabetes, eating disorder and heart arrhythmia are only a few. You need to be checked out in hospital.",

            "answer": "Sounds to me like you need to be checked for Diabetes. My husband was the same way. He lost a lot of weight and thought life was grand. He didn't care that he would black out, be sweating even when everyone else was freezing cold. Then he finally went to the doctor when he had trouble with his vision and his blood sugar was running over 600. He was lucky he hadn't died before then. Please get to a doctor and let them check you for Diabetes.",

    "question": "Last week, I had an episode of fainting, I woke up feeling faint then walked few steps before feeling weird and sweating then everything turned black. I couldn't see a single thing, the world was black around me so I started reaching out for a chair I can sit on then the next thing I know, I open my eyes and I'm on the ground. I think this lasted few minutes, I wasn't panicking or anything. All I could think of was, I don't want anyone to see me like this and that I should feel better soon or I'll miss my bus. No one witnessed this, I was alone. After I opened my eyes and noticed I was on the ground, I called my friend who immediately came but nothing else happened that day other than feeling some kind of a tightness in my chest. I wasn't hyperventilating before this happened, I was normally walking but feeling slightly weird.I have experienced unintended weight loss, I lost around 11 Ibs\u00a0\u00a0in a month for no reason, I have lost my appetite but I've been forcing myself to eat so my food intake is fine. I haven't been drinking water though, I do not like the taste of it but I have been drinking juice instead.Also, I'm experiencing tiredness, dizziness, nausea and have been very emotional. A recent upsetting event happened which might be why I'm emotional or feel like my heart is being squeezed.I have slight tremors as well but this is nothing new, It has been going on for years. This is my second episode of fainting, It happened once years ago but I never mentioned it to a doctor. I went to one after the incident and they checked my blood, told me I was anemic but that was because I was on my menstrual cycle which is heavy.I'm 20 years old Female with a BMI of 14.7. I tried to gain weight but never succeeded, I mostly eat fast food hoping it would help me gain weight but it never did. I don't want to go to a doctor because I feel like they will tell me that everything is fine with me. That it's all in my head.In the past, I had a lot of symptoms and every time I went, I was told everything is normal so I don't want to go through the same procedure again. I know they will tell me it's all in my head,the doctor will not be believe me so I don't see the point.I'm asking here because I'm not sure if it is really in my head, the fainting was very real and I want to know If I should see a doctor even though I don't see the point in seeing one.",
