            "answer": "Diabetes is a dangerous condition and must be controlled if other organ systems are to remain healthy.\u00a0\u00a0This person's fasting blood sugar is 250+, which indicates that his diabetes is not under control.\u00a0\u00a0If the blood sugar has been high for many years, then there is unfortunately a good chance that the heart, the blood vessels, and the kidneys may all have become diseased and perhaps badly damaged.Diabetes can cause pains in the extremities called 'diabetic neuropathy.'\u00a0\u00a0However, such pain can also be due to changes in the pH values of the blood, which in their turn maybe be caused by kidney disease.\u00a0\u00a0There are many, many other causes, as well.Excessive sleepiness likewise has many causes, but certainly problems with blood sugar and poor circulation are among them.I suggest you google 'Risks and complications of uncontrolled diabetes' to gain a better understanding of what this patient is experiencing.",
