            "answer": "Your endo should have run the FT3 test. Looks like she's treating the TSH, which is a pituitary hormone, and doesn't always paint the full thyroid picture. FT3/FT4 are direct thyroid hormones.Your FT4 is low. That is probably why you are tired. I don't know your FT3.I suggest getting a second opinion.You should get the TGab and TPOab antibody tests to rule out Hashimoto's.This site lists endos that are recommended by their patients. Make sure you call and ask how many thyroid patients the endo treats. Too many specialize in diabetes and don't know SQUAT about thryoid. I went through four endos before I found a good one:http://www.thyroid-info.com/topdrs/:) Tamra",

            "answer": "Yes you can have temproary thyroiditis. Acutally it is more common than told. Stress is a BIG factor as pregnancy is too .TSH 3rd generation is even a worse test than just basing it on a TSH. #rd generation is a lump test - is not the right one at all.You are in \"normal\" if you need to go by TSH - the recommendation with the AACE is .3-3.0.Tamra is right - you have to get the other tests to really now. Keep in mind hormones are hormones and what your body may be going through will effect your tests results.",
