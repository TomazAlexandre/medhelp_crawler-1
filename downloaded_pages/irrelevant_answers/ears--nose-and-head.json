    "question": "I had face burning sensation in March this year.\u00a0\u00a0I felt immense pressure behind my ears. After prednisone and ibrufin I got better. There was a lot of post nasal drainage and the burning sensation and ear pressure went away.\u00a0\u00a0The ENT thought it was a Eustachian tube dysfunction.\u00a0\u00a0This September I got the same symptoms back. Except no ear pressure this time. My face and lips experienced some burning sensation and I felt weak and heavy in my calf muscles.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor put me on antihistamine and the facial burning sensation reduced. However I started to experience burning sensation in my head - scalp.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it felt like acid thrown on it and sometime it felt like a my hair had been pulled too long and the area in the head was sore.\u00a0\u00a0Blood work showed low B12 (247) and Vitamin D (8). I took a B12 shot Last Monday and the muscle weakness and weird sensation in the leg went away.\u00a0\u00a0A day or two later I started to inhale steam and the burning sensation is 1-2 on a scale of 1-10.\u00a0\u00a0An appointment with a neurologist determined that my nerve conduction test was normal.\u00a0\u00a0I am experiencing pot nasal drainage each time I press on my face, behind the ear etc.I am terrified of MS.\u00a0\u00a0Or is it something with the Eyes, NOse and Throat only.Anyone with similar experience?",
