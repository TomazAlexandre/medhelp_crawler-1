            "answer": "I never actually went into labor because I had to have a csection due to the location of the placenta, but I'm fairly small (about 5'2\") and the doctor always thought my daughter was going to be around 8 or even up to 9 pounds. At my 39 week appointment he was feeling around belly and guessed she was about 7lbs 8oz. She was only born at 7lbs 6oz. I would say don't worry to much because your baby might not grow that much in the next few weeks. They're not always right about the baby's size inside of you anyway. I hope you can hear some good experiences too.",

    "question": "Hello mamas, i have been away for a little while...getting things ready!!! Have any of you moms birthed a macrosomic baby naturally??? I had my 33 week ultrasound a little while ago baby was 6 lbs and was told the baby will be macrosomic, my 2 boys were biiiig but this baby is supossed to be bigger, the thing is i don't have diabetes nor i am obese, i only gained around 8/9 kilograms...i eat healthy!!! So i want to know if there other moms who birthed macrosomic babies??? My baby is over 99% percentile scale at 33, i am not afraid or labor or birth i am jist worried about shoulder dystocia and asfixia due to size. If you had a natural birth with macrosomic baby please let me know how was it...my youngest was 9 1/2 lbs and 56 cm...so at 34 weeks he was at 84% percentile, i can barely walk due to extreme pain on coxis, hips, foot sole :-( , so i can't say i will walk everyday because the next day i wont be able to move.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to all of you mamas and thanks for taking your time and answer:-D!!!",
