            "answer": "Feeling lightheaded is the feeling of being \"spaced out\" or having the sensation of spinning inside your head. It can also give you the sensation that if your lightheadedness worsens, you might lose consciousness. Causes may include:* Inner ear disorders. These abnormalities of your inner ear can lead to illusions of motion and make you feel like you're floating.* Anxiety disorders. Certain anxiety disorders, such as panic attacks and a fear of leaving home or being in large, open spaces (agoraphobia), may cause lightheadedness.* Hyperventilation. Abnormally rapid breathing that often accompanies anxiety disorders may make you feel lightheaded.* Blood sugar rises and falls below normal expected rangesWhat to do: Seek medical attention ASAP. Write all your symptoms down on paper especially if they happen after certain activities. Write down your diet - foods and liquid intake. Take this to the doctor when you see him/her. Ask for a diabetes test HgbA1c and be sure to ask for a CBC and lipid panel tests.Good luck.",
