I'm concerned and his dad isn't given opportunities to be involved medically,\u00a0\u00a0she's put documentation that he is not on any paperwork that he cannot even call and ask questions.

            "answer": "Wow, as an adult with ADHD and someone in healthcare, and as a child experienced divorce and visitation related issues, I believe that 'continuity of care' is essential. Please use those words when you discuss this with the professionals involved.If your husband does not know 100% of his son's medical / emotional information - he can not respond to a health issue when the son is in his/your care. Accidents happen - if you both don't know the doctors and counselors involved, and any medications or care his received or is receiving, then how can you be if any help to the son is a problem were to arise?\u00a0\u00a0I have worked in after-school programs, at a rehabilitation hospital and in schools. I have seen children have seizures, had a serious spider bite and allergic reactions. I myself have had to diagnose my own & family member's allergies and keep on top of potential concerns.I strongly feel that you cannot adequately parent a child without full access and knowledge of his medical and mental health. The basics of survival are safety, health and nutrition. This is also a quality of care issue. Daycare providers even ask for basic information related to medical issues and have permission to seek treatment. Can your husband not request or take him for an assessment?It must feel horrible to hungry all the time and embarrassing regarding not having control of his elimination. Please impress upon your husband the necessity of getting more information and collaboration. This young one is a developing boy approaching puberty, he needs not adequate, but excellent care. Having ADHD already comes with many challenges, lets minimize any others.Truly and Genuinely praying for your family and want to say 10 gold stars for your keen observations and desire to help and your love for this little one.",

    "question": "I am new but curious as to others opinions. My step son is 9. His father and I have been together and married going on a total of 5 years now. He is very thin (like scrawny thin)no meat on him at all, paisty white....but eats all the time and huge portions. He's always hungry. He comes hungry and leaves hungry. We drive an HR to the zoo. We do fast food bfast. Everyone gets a meal,\u00a0\u00a0he also gets an extra sandwich. He will still be hungry and my husband gives up his bfast so he can have a 3rd sandwich. My husband allows him to have 3rds even 4ths before anyone had seconds sometimes at dinner,\u00a0\u00a0claiming he doesn't want him to go to moms saying we wouldn't let him eat. (off subject sorry) anyways he eats so much yet is so sickly skinny and pale. Like paper white pale. He also poops his pants still and has since I've known him. Any suggestions as to why he may always be so hungry?",
