            "answer": "TSH is a pituitary hormone that is affected by so many things that at best it is only an indicator, to be considered along with more important indicators such as symptoms and also levels of the biologically active thyroid hormones, Free T4 and Free T3.\u00a0\u00a0Please tell us about symptoms that you have.",

            "answer": "I'd say that those symptoms are very indicative of hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0Your status cannot be determined by biochemical tests alone; however, you do need to get your doctor to test for both of the biologically active thyroid hormones, Free T4 and Free T3.\u00a0\u00a0If the doctor resists, just insist and don't take no for an answer.\u00a0\u00a0Along with the Free T4 and Free T3 I also recommend testing for Vitamin D, B12 and ferritin.\u00a0\u00a0Don't assume that your doctor being an Endo means he is a thyroid expert.\u00a0\u00a0Many of them specialize in diabetes, not thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Also many of them have the \"Immaculate TSH Belief\" and only pay attention to that, which is inadequate.\u00a0\u00a0If tested beyond TSH it is usually only Free T4 and then if within the range, most often you will be told you do not have a thyroid problem and that your symptoms are due to something else.A good thyroid doctor is what you need.\u00a0\u00a0By that I man a doctor that will test and adjust Free T4 and Free T3 as needed to relieve symptoms, without being constrained by resultant TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0Symptom relief should be all important, not just test results, and especially not TSH results.If you can get those tests done, then please post them along with reference ranges and we will be glad to help interpret and advise further.",
