            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for your question. There are several types of neuropathy, but without being able to examine you in details I can not provide a precise diagnosis. Most common form is a peripheral neuropathy and occurred by deterioration in the nerve function at the limbs. It represents with symptoms of loss of sensation (or pins and needles like) in the arms, hands, legs and feet. Since there are many causes of neuropathy, hence treatment involves seeking these conditions out and correcting any underlying problem such as poor sugar control in diabetes in order to get a relief in your symptoms. Unfortunately, there is no permanent cure of neuropathy but symptomatic relief can be provided. Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Thank you Dr.\u00a0\u00a0I definitely agree on the difficulty to diagnose neuropathy.In this case, diabetes, or any other dietary sugar issues, is not involved.Autonomic neuropathy has been diagnosed based on long-term symptoms (affecting respiration, digestion, heart beat, temperature control), and only very recent symptoms for peripheral neuropathy are presenting (frequent numbness in extremeties, insect crawling feelings, etc).\u00a0\u00a0I do not know the rate at which these typically progress.However, the \"physical wasting\" is also extremely troubling at this point as it seems unstoppable.\u00a0\u00a0Didn't realize cachexia was related to neuropathy so I was curious if anyone had seen these issues related, and if by chance it might really mean another pathology is present that hasn't been detected yet.",

    "question": "Does anyone have any knowledge about autonomic (or peripheral) neuropathy with cachexia?Neuropathy present, likely result of previous TBI.\u00a0\u00a0Patient is wasting away even though daily intake is nutritionally dense and sufficient.\u00a0\u00a0No diabetes, hiv, cancer, tumors, autoimmune, or eating disorders.",
