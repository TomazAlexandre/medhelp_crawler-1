            "answer": "goolarra,Thank you so much for your reply! You gave me so much great information in your post.So good to know about the importance if the FT3 test. I will hopefully be going to see my PCP within the next couple of days....she is very receptive to patients suggestions, so I will ask if I can get that tested if she wasn't planning to do that already.Thank you again!Jen",

    "question": "Hello,My thyroid was tested January 2010 with the following results:Free T4:\u00a0\u00a00.90 (0.7-1.55)Total T3: (for some reason wasn't tested)Ultra TSH: 6.94 (0.25-5.0)I was told to take some non-prescription supplements (iodine & and one containing thyroid gland with thyroxine removed) to help bring my TSH down by my Nurse Practioner/OB GYN. Because I was still having the same symptoms after a few months (episodes where the left side of my neck would feel hot, tender and like someone is squeezing it, achey all over, painful heels and wrists, scratchy eyes, hard to focus, forgetful, cold hands and feet and others)I was tested again in May 2010 and also had the antibody tests:Free T4:\u00a0\u00a00.9 (0.8-1.9)Thyroglobulin AB: 78\u00a0\u00a0 (<20)Thyroid Peroxidase AB\u00a0\u00a0<10\u00a0\u00a0(<35)Is 78 high enough to be considered indicative of Hashimotos?Can you still have Hashimotos with a high Thyroglobulin and an in-range Thyroid Peroxidase AB?Is it most likely that I do in fact have Hashimoto's based on the above test results?(I was told yesterday about the results, sent my lab work and told to see my Primary Care Physician about getting an ultrasound and a possibly an endocrinologist referral....just trying to wrap my head around some of this before going!)Thank you so very much for your time and expertise!Sincerely,Jen :)",
