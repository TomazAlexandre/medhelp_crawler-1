            "answer": "I'm having growth scans at the moment, i'm 36 weeks tomorrow, and my bub is measuring up in the 14-20th percentile. My last son was 4lb 14oz at 38 weeks. I am a small framed person normally, so maybe i just have small babies, but i always get gestational diabetes too, which should be giving me bigger babies! I don't know whats going on, but they still tell me bub is in the normal range, when it starts dropping into the 10th percentile, thats when they get concerned. With your bub in the 24th percentile, thats still considered normal, just on the smaller side of normal. At least they will be monitoring bub's progress, and he has heaps of time left to catch up!",
