            "answer": "\"HCV infection significantly lowered vitamin B(6) and folate (p<0.05). Therapy caused further decrease in vitamin B(6) (p<0.05), and also significantly decreased vitamins B(1) and B(2) (p<0.05). This anti-HCV therapy caused more patients to exhibit insufficient iron status.HCV infection elevated plasma level of malondialdehyde and 8-isoprostane, and therapy further exacerbated lipid oxidation (p<0.05). HCV infection significantly lowered vitamin C and glutathione levels (p<0.05); therapy significantly reduced alpha-tocopherol and activity of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase (p<0.05).CONCLUSION:This anti-HCV therapy elevated oxidative stress and depleted B vitamins and iron. Thus, the supplement of antioxidant agents, B vitamins and/or iron should be considered for patients with this therapy in order to avoid other healthy risk.\"- Vitamins B depletion, lower iron status and decreased antioxidative defense in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated by pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin.",

    "question": "I am a 57 year old woman with Type II diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I've also been diagnosed with HepC several years ago and was non-responsive to the Interferon/Riboviron regimen.\u00a0\u00a0The treatment made me very ill and I experienced very debilitating depression. Since that treatment, I've noticed how my forearms bruise and cut easily. I don't heal like I used to.\u00a0\u00a0I started juicing almost a year ago, avoid GMO foods, I eat more fish, lots of vegetables and drink lots of water.\u00a0\u00a0I don't drink or smoke or do drugs. I quit all that 20 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0Had 6 children.\u00a0\u00a0I've been training for a Marathon and have been enjoying the challenges and the results too.\u00a0\u00a0I've been able to maintain close to normal glucose levels without Metformin, and I test 3 - 4 times a day.\u00a0\u00a0The skin on my legs look good, my face and hair, but when I look at my forearms I want to cry.\u00a0\u00a0I use special makeup to cover it up.\u00a0\u00a0It's just my forearms. Seems I never see them without the ugly bruises, scars & cuts.\u00a0\u00a0Why is this happening to me? My kidney function was normal, It's the first time in years my blood tests came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0My A1C was slightly elevated, but down from 10.4 to 6.9.\u00a0\u00a0Am I vitamin deficient?This discussion is related to/posts/Undiagnosed-Symptoms/marks-bruises-that-dont-heal/show/1525120.",
