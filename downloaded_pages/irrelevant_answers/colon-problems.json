            "answer": "Dear higirl:I am sorry that your having constipation.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't think that your constipation is due to \"nerve\" problems.\u00a0\u00a0Other that the constipation you do not indicate that a neurological cause may be probable, i.e. symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I might check out the lower back problems, there are times that delivery can induce some lower lumbar problems.\u00a0\u00a0However, this usually does not cause constipation problems.\u00a0\u00a0What does your GI specialist think about your GI problems? I think I would pursue this area as the source of the problem.\u00a0\u00a0You are doing the correct thinkgs in trying to increase your fiber.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

            "answer": "Hi, higirl and Buggs; I just came back from the GI doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I have been constipated for several weeks now; my referring doctor was concerned that I might have polyps; but the GI is leaning more towards neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0I have diabetes, and have neuropathy in my extremities.\u00a0\u00a0So you might want to be checked for diabetes, if you have not.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know yet about treatment as we don't have a final diagnosis for my constipation, but I hope you both get better.",

    "question": "I have had problems with my colon for the last 9 years.\u00a0\u00a0It started after the birth of my last child and the subsequent tubal ligation.\u00a0\u00a0At first I could not have a bowel movement without a laxative.\u00a0\u00a0I began to include more fiber in my diet, exercise more, and drink more water in an attempt to remedy the problem. I used a natural colon cleanse product for a year and a half. These attempts produced slight improvement. I began drinking prune juice every morning which helped. I then went through a series of colonics and enemas.\u00a0\u00a0There was a noticeable improvement, but still the problem exists.\u00a0\u00a0My symptoms now include:\u00a0\u00a0Constipation, gas and bloating, pressure on my rectum and lower back pain much of the time, forced stools with lower back spasms following.I had a colonoscopy done 6 months ago and everything looked fine.\u00a0\u00a0My question is:\u00a0\u00a0Could my constipation be the result of nerve damage or hormonal imbalance, and if so, how would I go about determining the problem and a possible treatment? Any help would be appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you",
