            "answer": "Thank you so much for your informative responses.\u00a0\u00a0I think that the state I live in mandates that insurance carriers cover diabetic supplies as a non-excluded pre-existing condition, because I have never had a problem.\u00a0\u00a0They also usually only exclude other conditions 9 months to max of 1 year generally.\u00a0\u00a0You might want to consider moving here!\u00a0\u00a0I found this blurb/update on the internet for National Conference of State Legislatures:\"As of May 2004, forty-six states have some type of laws requiring health insurance coverage to include treatment for diabetes. The states not included are Alabama, Idaho, North Dakota and Ohio.\u00a0\u00a0In 2002, Georgia and Wisconsin each passed an expansion of current coverage requirements. In 2003 Hawaii adopted a resolution to clarify its mandate of diabetes education coverage.\"I am just complaining about the high cost of insurance, I guess. The drug companies have restrictions that often do no literally apply to my situation.\u00a0\u00a0I find that there is much more available in the way of financial support for victims of heart attacks.\u00a0\u00a0The fact that diabetes is ongoing and only a few of us have the IDDM type might be a factor.\u00a0\u00a0It would be nice if a foundation would start up a grant program for financially traumatized diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0I tend to under-treat to save money - go without testing and carry candy, for instance, when I have scrimped my way through a tight spot previously.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think this is optimal and meet many diabetis who cannot afford to test 7 times a day to keep things under control.Is there anything we can do as a group?",
