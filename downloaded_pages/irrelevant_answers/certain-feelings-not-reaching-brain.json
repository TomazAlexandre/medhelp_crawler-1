            "answer": "Anxiety/panic attacks do not cause brain damage and neither does a minor sinus infection. You might just be under stress worrying about how you are feeling, and this stress is blocking those \"pleasure\" signals from being recorded in the brain. I really do not think it is vercaused by anything more serious.",

    "question": "Hello Everyone,I am just way to happy that I found this website and have been helped many of times. I have a question and please oh please don't judge me : ( I'm red in the face while typing from shame but I am really concerned.I have been battling anxiety and panic attacks for about a month now but they are getting a bit easier to control. I've been feeling under the weather as well and just got some antibiotics for a sinus infection. During all of this my brain has been feeling groggy and clouded.So I heard that (okay, I'm getting to the embarassing point) sex is a great mood booster, stress reliever etc. Not that I didn't already know this but had been the furthest thing from my mind since I've been sick. So I tried it out.Sigh, Here it goes, please forgive me,I had an orgasm and for the first time in my life I could only feel the orgasm below my waist. I usually feel it all over and then up to my head. So I tried again today just to see and nothing.My orgasm or pleasure senses are not reaching my brain.Has anyone had this happened to them before. I'm really scared that during all of these anxiety/panic attacks and my sinus infection that the nerves in my brain have been damaged.So sorry for the long post, just like to make sure I am making sense to everyone and not just myself.Any help or suggestion would be greatly appreciated.Thanks in advanced",
