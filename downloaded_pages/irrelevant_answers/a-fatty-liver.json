Instead, doctors typically work to treat the risk factors that contribute to your liver disease. For instance, if you're obese, your doctor will help you to lose weigh through diet, exercise and, in some cases, medications and surgery. If a medication is causing your fatty liver disease, your doctor will try to switch you to a different medication.Lifestyle and home remediesAlong with your doctor's help, you can take steps to control your nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. You can:* Lose weight. If you're overweight or obese, reduce the number of calories you eat each day and increase your physical activity in order to lose weight. Aim to lose one or two pounds a week. If you've tried to lose weight in the past and have been unsuccessful, ask your doctor for help.* Choose a healthy diet. Eat a healthy diet that's rich in fruits and vegetables. Reduce the amount of saturated fat in your diet and instead select healthy unsaturated fats, such as those found in fish, olive oil and nuts. Include whole grains in your diet, such as whole-wheat breads and brown rice.* Exercise and be more active. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week. Incorporate more activity in your day. For instance, take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walk instead of taking short trips in your car. If you're trying to lose weight, you might find that more exercise is helpful. But if you don't already exercise regularly, get your doctor's OK first and start slowly.* Control your diabetes. Follow your doctor's instructions to stay in control of your diabetes. Take your medications as directed and closely monitor your blood sugar.* Lower your cholesterol. A healthy plant-based diet, exercise and medications can help keep your cholesterol and your triglycerides at healthy levels.* Protect your liver. Avoid things that will put extra stress on your liver. For instance, don't drink alcohol. Follow the instructions on all medications and over-the-counter drugs.\"",
