            "answer": "You monitor your BSL because then the dr has a hard copy of which way your going and what treatments you will need. If you stick the the correct diet and still have high levels then your can be a candidate for insulin, and possibly other necessary medical interventions. Also it helps determine how your baby will be when it gets here.I have to test mine 4 times a day too, and since testing its been normal. I am over feeling like a pin cushion but believe its necessary so will suck it up and keep on pricking my finger.",

    "question": "I'm struggling to eat right. I'm not hungry for the right foods. My test levels are always hypoglycemic when I eat right so I stopped my diet and eat most of what I want except anything with sugar, and most of the time stay away from fast carbs. Despite not sticking to the strict diet my sugar levels are now normal.\u00a0\u00a0I'm so confused by all of this. I know the inns and outs of the disorder, I know my test results aren't really making sense. Has anybody else struggled with this disorder so I don't feel so alone here. Wish I knew what was going on.",
