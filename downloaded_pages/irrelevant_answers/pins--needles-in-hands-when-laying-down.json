    "question": "Whenever I lay down on my side (either side) my hands both fall asleep. When I hold a phone or have my arm up above holding something for a few seconds my hands fall asleep. The pins and needs sensation goes away as soon as I change positions. It wakes me up all night long. I saw an orthopaedic dr months back and they tested me for carpel tunnel. Said it was not carpel tunnel but didn't offer me what it could be. It seems to have gotten much worse lately. Should I be concerned? My mother has chronic ms but her symptoms seem different. It doesn't appear to be neurological at least I don't think because it goes away with movement? Please advise what it could be and where I can go to try and fix this problem? It is driving me crazy....",
