            "answer": "Pyloric stenosis is a narrowing of the pyloric valve between the stomach and the duodenum.\u00a0\u00a0It can cause nausea, vomiting or GERD. It is not a serious condition and can be treated easily with surgery. Almost certainly the cause of your GP.\u00a0\u00a0Follow up with your GI doc and you'll soon be on your way.",

            "answer": "David is absolutely correct.\u00a0\u00a0When you eat, food moves from the mouth to the stomach and is broken down into what is called Chyme.\u00a0\u00a0Chyme moves out of the stomach through the pyloric valve at the bottom of the stomach.\u00a0\u00a0It moves through a small section of bowel called the duodenum that connects the stomach to the small intestines.\u00a0\u00a0The small opening called the pyloric valve is at least partially blocked and not allowing food to move into the duodenum and small intestines.\u00a0\u00a0This slowed emptying of the stomach is called gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0Gastroparesis is often a complication of Diabetes Mellitus.\u00a0\u00a0As David said, the surgery is a simple one in the outpatient clinic.\u00a0\u00a0See a gastroenterologist for this.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck",

            "answer": "My daughter is 20 and recently diagnosed with gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0She is tall, thin and not a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0She did have her gall bladder removed 1.5 years ago due to 0% ejection factor.\u00a0\u00a0She has been hospitalized 3 times since October but this last time was told she has enlarged lymph nodes on her small intestines and the intestines are also swollen.\u00a0\u00a0This was seen when she has exploratory surgery.\u00a0\u00a0They removed her appendix which appeared healthy but due to her pain, they took it out.\u00a0\u00a0The biopsy came back and noted her appendix were infected.My question is does anyone who has gastroparesis also have problems with the intestines?\u00a0\u00a0The doctor has us a bit nervous and said we will have to take her to John Hopkins, Mt. Sinai or the Mayo Clinic to treat the intestinal problems.\u00a0\u00a0We are so confused.\u00a0\u00a0Her pain in the right side has gone away since the appendix were removed but we dont know why she has enlarged nodes on her small intestines.\u00a0\u00a0When she was hospitalized in Dec. (2nd hospitalization) she was diagnosed with fluid in her lower right abd. region but no one could tell us why and she was discharged.\u00a0\u00a0Her gyno ruled out ALL gyno related possibilites.\u00a0\u00a0Any information regarding her enlarged nodes and swollen intestines would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sherri",

            "answer": "Hi, can see your worried abt your daughter as I would be as well, I would take her to a teaching hospital, because thru my experience, unless\u00a0\u00a0its simple regular hosp. and DRs. don't go the extra mile, to fiquire it out. Someone like House. I now I wish I had a Dr. House. (lol)\u00a0\u00a0I would speculate that if her appendix was infected maybe that is why her nodes on sm intestines were enlarged.\u00a0\u00a0They do react to infection. I'm not sure but isn't the appendix at the end of sm intestines??I wish you well, I have many recent problems, but, my daughter whom I had at 40, shehas congenital heart defect, and evrytime I take her, I feel like I will pass out.But she is a fighter. And a hefty 58 lbs of solid rock at age 4.Bless you.........Denise",
