            "answer": "you can eat the stuff it all depends on the portion size.\u00a0\u00a0I have gestational diabetes right now and I am watching what i eat and check my sugar level 4-5 times a day.\u00a0\u00a015grams of carbs is 1 carb choice.\u00a0\u00a0If somethings have fiber in it and the labels says more then 5g then you can subtract the grams of fiber from the total carbs which will reduce the amount.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that i could eat up to 17 CHOICES a day, but that is based on where i am at in my pregnacy (31w3d) and my weight.\u00a0\u00a0I don't come anywhere near that amount a day and have been doing really well keeping it under control.\u00a0\u00a0You basically have to spread the number out throughout the day.\u00a0\u00a0Also you have to eat breakfast, morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner, and then a snack before bed, they say to do this to keep you numbers in control b/c if you don't eat your liver automatically will push out sugar into your blood thinking that your not getting enough, and that will cause your numbers to skyrocket.\u00a0\u00a0If you want to know more then feel free to ask.PS> don't forget to watch the serving sizes on the label b/c thats what the carbs is based off!",

Also pricking your fingers all the time sucks but i am happy that i don't need insulin or anything like that.\u00a0\u00a0My sugar levels are staying relatively normal and i haven't been having many side affects at all.\u00a0\u00a0The baby is measuring right on track and NOT bigger, which is something that can happen when you have this.",

            "answer": "Sounds like your doing great then! That's good to hear..... I haven't had to deal with any of this in 3+ years so I had forgotten about all of this. I am always checking the SUGARS and fibers and not the carbs on labels. Your info has brought back some memories! Thanks for your help I don't know how I am gonna make till December! Maybe I won't fail the 1 hour though and I won't have to start pricking. My Dr. just said I had some symptoms that showed I hadn't been watching my diet. Which I hadn't when I first found out about being pg again which was really early along and when I knew we were trying. I had ICE CREAM EVERYDAY. I was eating sweets of all kinds just becuz I was trying to get it out of my system before my Dr. told me I couldn't have it anymore. Sure enough on my first visit with her she was like YOU NEED TO WATCH YOUR SUGARS YOU KNOW THE PROBLEMS YOU CAN HAVE.......",
