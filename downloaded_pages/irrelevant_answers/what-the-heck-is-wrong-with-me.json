            "answer": "Hello!It is important to understand the period of your layoff.If it is just for a couple of weeks then you have to follow up with a physician to get your hemoglobin levels checked and other basic indicators monitored such as blood pressure and heart rate.Eat a balanced diet and increase your protein intake.If your symptoms continue then go for some blood tests to rule out diabetes and thyroid dysfunctions.Give yourself some time and also rule out menstrual problems etc. If it was a long lay off then it is due to stiffness and low endurance.Take care!",
