            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!A sudden spike in blood pressure with blurring of vision could be a sign of TIA or transient ischemic attack or mini stroke. Hence all predisposing factors to TIA should be ruled out like polycythemia vera, sickle cell disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, hyperviscosity syndromes, hypertension etc. The blood pressure should be monitored for 24 hours and see if there are spikes in between.You may also need a MRI of the brain and other tests.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
