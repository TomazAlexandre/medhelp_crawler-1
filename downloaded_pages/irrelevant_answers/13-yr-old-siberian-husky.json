    "question": "We were just told that our 13 year old huskey has Cushing's Disease. She drinks an insane amount of water, is now having accidents (she never had them before), pants heavily all of the time, and her back legs are getting weak. The cost of treatment is very high, but we have a great vet that lets us makes payment. But we still do not know what to do for her. She is very old and I do not understand the death it will bring to her. Is she too old to treat? With her age in mind, do you think that treatment is what she needs? I love her dearly and we have lost 3 dogs in the last 8 months to congestive heart failure, cancer and kidney failure. When the time came to put them to sleep, they suffered. I do not want her to suffer.\u00a0\u00a0Any advice?",
