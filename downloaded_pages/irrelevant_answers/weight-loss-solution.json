            "answer": "Welcome to the WL&D Community; we're thrilled you are here!\u00a0\u00a0When we are faced with a high BMI, we sometimes think of every way imaginable to implement a quick fix.\u00a0\u00a0However, just as we gained it pound by pound over time, that is the same way we need to lose it .. it is healthy and sensible.When I began, my BMI was 53.3, which was frightening.\u00a0\u00a0Rather than being overwhelmed, we need to begin implementing small changes that, over time, net large results.Start moving and do whatever exercise you can in a day.\u00a0\u00a0Record it in your exercise tracker here on MedHelp and then the next day strive to do one minute more.\u00a0\u00a0Keep doing this consistently and you will increase your exercise stamina, your muscles will respond and grow and the weight will start coming off.In addition, start making some healthier choices in food.\u00a0\u00a0Don't worry about being perfect and always making the right choices, that is not realistic.\u00a0\u00a0You may wish to remember to choose baked and roasted foods rather than breaded and fried.\u00a0\u00a0Implement fresh, frozen or canned fruits and vegetables but be sure to make healthier selections (like packed in it's own juice or lite syrup rather than heavy syrup) and watch the type and amount of toppings you put on your vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0The more natural, the healthier.\u00a0\u00a0This does not mean you have to sacrifice flavor.Then, stay in tune on a regular basis with this community.\u00a0\u00a0TrudieC and Skailark are but two of the knowledge, caring and compassionate members of this community who are here to support, encourage and help you along your journey.How do I know this works?\u00a0\u00a0I've done it and my BMI is now 28.4.Why would I suggest this over lap band surgery?\u00a0\u00a0Lap band surgery may help in a life threatening situation.\u00a0\u00a0However, I would ask you this.\u00a0\u00a0If we do not address the emotional relationship we have with food and the reasons why we overeat .. then aren't we doomed to continue that after the initial success of the lapband surgery?\u00a0\u00a0Our stomachs will stretch again even after that procedure.That is the reasoning that kept me from choosing that route and the reasons behind selecting a lifestyle change.\u00a0\u00a0Hope you'll join us and wish you sincere best wishes for your health whatever your decision.\u00a0\u00a0Please know, as a community, we will support your decision either way.Many (((Hugs)))Ranae",

            "answer": "I agree with what the rest have said.\u00a0\u00a0You will get a lot of support and encouragement here.\u00a0\u00a0I'm quite new to this community, but I find that it really helps me be able to participate in the roll calls, etc - it helps keep me accountable for my choices.\u00a0\u00a0I don't like to have to get on here and admit that I didn't do something I should have (or did something I shouldn't have), but in order to make it work, that's what I have to do, so I do my best to \"behave\".One thing you don't mention is whether or not you have any medical problems (diabetes, thyroid, blood pressure, etc) that need to be addressed, along with the weight problem.\u00a0\u00a0Please make sure to get your dr's blessing for any diet/exercise program you decide to undertake, but any dr will give their blessing to healthy eating and exercise.I tend to be my own worst enemy, so have to keep reminding myself that I can't be perfect all the time (or even most of the time).\u00a0\u00a0I put on most of my weight while waiting for a thyroid disorder to be diagnosed, so it did come on relatively quickly, but I figured out months ago that it wasn't going to leave the same way it came.\u00a0\u00a0I also have a family history of diabetes and have already have some of the symptoms, although my blood sugar is still in the normal range.\u00a0\u00a0My dr has recommended a \"Mediterranean diet\" and I'm still trying to figure out exactly what that is; in the meantime, I'm trying to eat the things that I know are best for me.\u00a0\u00a0I also have to make sure that I keep very close tabs on portion sizes - that seems to be the key for me right now.\u00a0\u00a0Although, I've only managed to lose one pound over the past couple of weeks, I'm doing my best to get there the right way.I also make every effort to get enough exercise.\u00a0\u00a0My job requires quite a bit of physical activity and I make every effort to work out for at least an additional 30 min/day.\u00a0\u00a0I find that yoga works extremely well for me because it's a \"quiet\" way to exercise and is relaxing.\u00a0\u00a0The poses are done slowly and deliberately focusing on the form and duration.\u00a0\u00a0I am 5' tall, 144 lbs and 59 yrs old, so when I first watched my first yoga video, I thought \"yeah right. I'll put something out of joint if I try that\", but I did try and was surprised at how quickly I was able to catch on, though I quickly gave up any thought of being as limber as the person in the video!!\u00a0\u00a0 You only stretch as much as is comfortable (if it hurts stop) and it wasn't long before I realized that I was stretching almost twice as much as when I first started.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to yoga, I do strength training and aerobics now too, using the Wii Fit.\u00a0\u00a0It's taking a while, and though I'm not losing a lot of weight, I am gaining muscle so that's a big plus and I'm hoping that with perseverance, the weight will eventually come off.\u00a0\u00a0Just remember, find things you enjoy and that fit into your life style - preferably a variety so it doesn't get boring; start small and slow and work your way up.Last, but certainly not least - come back here often and let us know how you are doing.",
