            "answer": "Have you recently been retested by your doctor? If you drank a 75 gram glucose drink - for an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test [OGTT] - your preferred 2 hour maximum level is expected to be <140 mg/dl [< = less than]. However, some labs, and some doctors, use <180 mg/dl as the maximum range. Talk with your doctor and get properly tested - Fasting, OGTT and A1c tests. Lastly, try to restrict your consumption of bad carbs.",
