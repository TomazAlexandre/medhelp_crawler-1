            "answer": "Thanks for your response. I do not have any flutters or palpitations. The bottom number is mostly around 87 or 2-3 points up or down. My pressure goes up when I am anxious, scared or upset etc. and comes down quickly. What is worrisome is that everyday there are events that make us anxious, upset etc and is hard to control these situations. You had mentioned about expert forum, do you have an URL or recommend any particular forum?Jey",

    "question": "I am 40years old indian (asian) woman. Two months back I delivered my second baby. A week after the delivery I had high blood pressure, swelling of my legs and feet, very severe headache and on one day I almost fainted. When checking with my ob/gyn she said it could be an atypical pregnancy or a seizure type condition which sometimes happens and may be I am past that danger now. She recommended I check with my GP for high blood pressure. One time I had to go to the emergency becaus my BP went 170/104 and I had tingling and numbness in my left arm.From the blood tests I have high cholestrol and high triglycerides. (I had borderline Gestational diabetes which was controlled by diet. My mom is diabetic) While my GP said that I could take cholestrol control pills, my ob/gyn said that these results might not be considered normal because I just delivered a baby. Basically I have conflicting opinions. I do not think the root cause for my blood pressure has been understood, neither the cause for my unconsciousness (though it lasts only for a second or less).When I went to the emergency a month back, the doctors had me go through ECG and dopler ultrasound of the heart and found no issues with my heart. From MRI of my brain the Neurologist said that I have a very small menigioma and is not of a concern for now. But I might want to check every 1-2 years to make sure everything is alright.But now two months later, I still have various weird symptoms. My blood pressure generally remains normal 118/86 most of the day. But in the evenings it goes up - 129/89. Sometimes shoots as high as 145/103 and comes down fairly quickly. When I took BP tablets, the BP was coming down as low as 101/65. So my GP recommended that I use it only when the pressure is high. On and off I feel unconcious/ or have a feeling of blanking out for a second and then everything goes back to normal. I don't understand what this means. This occurs 3-4 times a week. Because my previous High BP, fainting type of symptoms happened around 8PM, every day when it is around 8PM, I get very anxious, nervous and sometimes to the extent of losing consciousness... I feel very fatigued.Can someone tell me what is going on, what is the right course of steps I need to take to understand the root cause of my problems, so they can be treated. I truly appreciate any thoughts/comments/suggestions.Jey",
