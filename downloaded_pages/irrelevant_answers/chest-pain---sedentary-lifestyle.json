            "answer": "A sedentary lifestyle contributes in many says to an increased risk for coronary artery disease. It is certainly associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. Exercise has beneficial effects on blood pressure, heart rate, mental health, and sleep. Cardiovascular well-being is not linked to one thing in particular. These are identified as modifiable (like weight, physical activity level, and blood pressure) and non-modifiable (age, sex, family history). People who have good physical conditioning irregardless of many other risk factors have a better long term outcome compared to those in not as good physical conditioning.",

    "question": "How can a sedentary lifestyle contribute to coronary artery disease or any heart problems?I don't get how, Is it the effects of a sedentary lifestyle that can contribute to heart problems ? like being inactive can cause obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure that can then result in problems in the future?I ask because I'm 22, not very active but eat fairly healthy I have occasional brief chest pain near heart, makes me think its angina straight away. This pain has not lasted over 1 min, i would say 1-8 Seconds once or twice a day, sometimes a few times in a week, Pretty Random at times. I have had good blood tests results like cholesterol, not diabetic etc etc, Normal ECG's. What could be wrong, should i be concerned at this age?",
