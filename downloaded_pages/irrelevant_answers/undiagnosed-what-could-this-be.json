            "answer": "Thanks for your reply :)Has Hashimoto's Thyroiditis or Cushing's Disease been ruled out?No, I haven't gotten any answers, not from the day when I found out that I had a goiter; after the surgery, nor my repeated doctor's visits.What was the Endo Specialist's opinion?I felt like the Endo's was laughing because I told them I had done some research and the whole time she was smiling in my face and not taking me serious. After she left the room, I heard laughing. When the surgeon did the tests, at least I got back more results. The endo only sent me a paper in the mail with my T4 and TSH and I had to request the T4, she claims they don't do the T3 unless they see something. Another thing was when I went in they didn't even take the paperwork that I had filled out of my health history and my families. I tried to give it and they said the doctor would ask for it. I got back there and they made me feel like a clown.You were on the BC when you were younger or now?\u00a0\u00a0I was confused about that.I was put on BC as a child because I had a cysts on my ovaries which caused me to bleed sometimes 20 days out of 30 and cause a lot of pain. To which I have had all my life. The bleeding doesn't happen like it used to now, maybe just once a year or I would come on twice in one month. I have always bled 6 to 7 days.What medications are your taking now?I am not taking any medications, not now or ever.",

Yes, I am having all kinds of symptoms and tanning and tiny spots where the color is slowly leaving on my legs; my joints hurt, and my shoulder bothers me sometimes really bad. I do get the heaviness in them when I do an activity. On Mother's Day this year, my sister, niece, and I all went Magic Mountain and we played softball and ping pong, by the time we ended I was totally out done and my arms were so heavy. I always thought those were inherited because my sister has them too and our mother had them as well but she had a whole host of problems from hysterectomy, diabetes, congested heart failure, liver failure, high blood pressure, and so on... I am not sure what is going on with me but I wish someday soon someone would listen to me because when I have my awful days I feel like crap.",

            "answer": "Yes, I am looking into another opinion. I know the BC years ago probably do not have anything to do with now, but I was wondering if it could have been a contributor because back then, I always had the memory problems, cysts, heavy menstrual (sometimes 20 or more days out of 30), facial & scalp rash... I remember one time the hospital couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. I just think that I had a hormonal problem all along and because some doctors don't have a clue, that its been ignored all along. Since my adult years I kept going to the hospital\u00a0\u00a0at one point & time for severe pains and so I asked for a hysterectomy and the nurse said that they would not just give me one and that I was too young but for me to see a GYN because I might have endometriosis. Then a couple of years later another part of my hormone system (thyroid/goiter) is being removed. I am not sure what is going on but I am going out of my mind :( The next time I have a doctors appt. though I will ask them to look for certain diseases though such the Cushing's or Hashimoto's or endo or osteo or diabetes. You and some others have made me question again why my glucose was high. When I went to the dentist, I was told that it wasn't thrush but then again I was trying to ask for Nystatin and she didn't know what I was talking about. Also I had a benign goiter and they only removed half. Again thanks for replying to my msg :)",

How you get the severe pains,and how you asked for a hystrectomy, the thyroid, the high glucose.Have you been tested for PCOS. this being polycystic ovary syndrome, which can affect glucose levels, etcI was thinking for you to ask for a hystrectomy , this must be bad, nobody asks to be cut.Have you had a scan on your ovaries?I would definately be asked to be tested for Diabetes, PCOS, Cushings.Thyroid profile along with thyroid antibodies. to check for Hashimotos.Also your eostrogen and progesterone. and cortisol, etc in other words a full endocrine panel doing.Also fibromyalgaia, which causes muscle pains can be linked with thyroid.This was just a thought.Keep me posted.Nicola",

            "answer": "Thanks for responding. I agree that I need to be checked for diabetes, my mother was a diabetic and she also had the little white spots on her skin. She had a hysterectomy right after having me. I was premature and I always said that I was probably under-developed... lol! But yes the pains can be so bad at times, I've had them all my woman-hood life, starting as a child. I can remember being rushed to the hospital because all I was able to do was ball up in a ball and cry. They found a cyst on my ovary and put me on birth control, supposedly to dissolve. Sometimes the pain will last the same amount of time when I would bleed for 20 or more days out of the month.At least twice a year I would have two periods in a month. This has been a roller coaster for me since as a child. Thanks again :)",

    "question": "Hello everyone,Feedback please? Sorry for the long post :(I first noticed a white spot on the side of my tongue. Around that time I had been taking some antibiotics for a UTI. I was hardly ever sick only some sore throats when my BF wanted to sleep with the ceiling fan on high but they wouldn't last long. I was and still is a smoker (cigs)and I drank heavily, except during that time I had slowed down and was under a lot of stress with work, school, and family. At work I would lick my lips a lot and use chapstick. I would sometimes put my Topical corticosteroid on my lips (I've used it for many years because as a child I have always had a facial and scalp rash). A year later the white had spread to my cheeks (it looks like a white film) at that time I was under a lot of stress because my boyfriend and mother died in the same year and I began smoking and drinking heavily again. Around the time my mother passed I was at the hospital and went to use the bathroom (#2) and it was as if I was constipated and the toilet looked like a bowl of blood. That is the time when I noticed the constipation in my life (before if I had it I didn't notice because I was always drinking). After that I had a spell to come over me where I was on the verge of fainting, nausea, and diarrhea and that happened once again in 2008. In 2005 & 2006 I was having problems breathing and I stayed fatigue terribly. Went to the hospital (2006) and they ran tests (which ones not sure) they took an x-ray too and they came back and said everything was fine but just before I left they came in and said that they found a goiter. They referred me to a surgeon. So from the hospital to the surgeon to surgery. Never was I told anything or reason. Since then my hair had stopped falling out as bad but I was still gaining weight. Then once again (2008), my hair had gotten worse (brittle and falling out); the weight gain, high blood pressure, severe shoulder pains, legs and feet pains, and face and scalp rash. I have gone to the doctors and they say that my thyroid levels are normal. Could this be a thyroid problem or candida? Here are the results of my test back in March -Back around March of this year I decided to go and see the doctor that had removed a goiter in 2006. This past Feb. I had been feeling really crappy - tired a lot, weight slowly was increasing, constipated (sometimes it is so unbearable), and hair falling out terribly. Here are the labs:Comprehensive Metabolic PanelSodium 139Potassium 3.4 (low)Chloride 103Bicarbonate 26Anion Gap 13Glucose 114 (high)BUN 9Creatinine .79eGFR >60eGFR African American >60Calcium 8.9Albumin 4.3Total Protein 7.5Alk Phos 68Bilirubin Total .3AST (SGOT) 18ALT (SGPT) 19TSH with REFLEX FREE T4TSH 3.06Then while I was waiting to be seen by an endo, in which I went 9/2/2010 (yes, it took 3 months to get in). The results just came back last week and they are:Free T4 1.22TSH, high sensitivity 2.309I took a glimpse of my chart and right after my surgery my TSH was 2.0Now I was never put on meds and they say that I am fine. Can anyone shed some light. Could my untreated thyroid be the cause of the white film in my mouth? Also could it be causing my thyroid to fluctuate? I was also told back in 2007 that the cartilage was wearing thin in my knees and I retains a lot of fluid on them and sometimes my ankles and feet; my heart palps at times. Back when my TSH was 3.06 I was even having very bad brain fog, nausea, constipation, heartburn, cold feet, low temp, tingling and in left hand and left leg, confusion, speech problems, and the so on on... But has anyone else experienced this? I was reading where the weather can affect the way you feel too. One more question, could all these symptoms be related to being put on birth control to dissolve a cysts on my ovaries as a child. I figured that as a child and young adult, that the hot flashes were all related. Sorry for the long post :(",
