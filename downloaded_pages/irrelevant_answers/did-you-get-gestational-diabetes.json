    "question": "Hey ladies, my doc just called and told me that there was glucose in my urine... I am 20 weeks with twins and do the chances are greater for me to get gestational diabetes, so I have to go in on Monday for the 1 hour test. My question to you all is if this has happened to you (glucose in your urine) and did you then develop gestational diabetes or not? I REALLY hope I don't have to go down this road!! Comments are SO appreciated!!",
