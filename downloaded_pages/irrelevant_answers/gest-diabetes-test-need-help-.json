            "answer": "They wanted me to take my glucose test around 16 weeks and I put it off and postponed it until about 21 weeks. I failed the one hour and at 22 weeks failed the 3 hour. Those 5 weeks or so I felt so shi**y......just so blah. I was throwing up 2-4 times a day I had zero energy, I was exhausted and dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0After I failed the 3 hour and they told me how I should change my diet and my body reacted accordingly. I had a feeling I had GD but I was in denial. The diet helped and improved my A1c (a blood test to check your average blood glucose over the last 2-3 months) but my numbers weren't where the doc wanted them so I've been on insulin close to 2 weeks now. Aside from all the stupid needles I feel better than I did just on the diet. I wish I would have taken the test at 16 weeks when they wanted me to. I feel like I could have avoided the insulin.Aside from all the possible complications it can cause your baby, making sure your body does what it's supposed to do really does make you feel better.",
