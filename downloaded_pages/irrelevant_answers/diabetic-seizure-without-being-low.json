After numerous tests, they say there is nothing they can find that would be causing his seizures, therefore they are blaming it on his diabetes. However, his glucose levels are usually between 80-120 when he seizes! My family and I are at our wits end. We need some answers to help him but, so far no one has been able to help us. Please if you get an answer, post for us all so we can talk to our Dr.s!",
