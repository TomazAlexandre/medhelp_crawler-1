            "answer": "Hello,I advice that instead of speculating about what you may or may not have, please visit your GP at the earliest. Various sexually transmitted diseases have similar symptoms. Also, HIV+ people are now being treated with newer drugs, which can prolong life span and improve quality of life. But time is of essence. Do not delay, but visit your doctor.Regards",

            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Yes, I agree with mini_d. The chances of STDs are very high and in drug users incidence of HIV is very high. Your wife could have contacted this and passed it to you. As mini_d pointed out there are various tests available and giant advancement in treatment options of STD. Hence you will be OK if timely intervention is done. Both you and wife should test for STDs. HIV test is negative in the window period. The test is only positive after two months of exposure. Please read through this link to know more about this testing: http://www.aids.org/factSheets/102-HIV-Testing.html#anchor98844Having said all this, there is a chance you have not caught a STD. Chronic diarrhea with joint pains is seen in STDs but is also seen in parasitic infestations, irritable bowel syndrome, coelic disease, crohn\u2019s disease, malabsorption syndromes, pancreatic diseases, diabetes, hyperthyroidism etc.Hope these tips help. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
