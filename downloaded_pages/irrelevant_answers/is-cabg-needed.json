            "answer": "I am not a doctor but from your angiogram results, I think it would be very difficult to reverse these findings through any lifes style changes, I think you may be beyond that point. It is good that you have developed some collateral blood flow for the areas of your heart that have the 100% blockages, but it looks like you are affected in all your arteries and with your past MI and diabetes I don't know that it would be worth the risk, CABG may be necessary.There are others on this forum that are much more knowledgable about this, kenkeith and Jack54 come to mind, both are very knowledable and perhaps they'll answer as well. Are you having angina pain with moderate exertion or any other symptoms and what is your age? These would be important to the cardiologist to make a reccommendation. Also, with a prior MI your LDL should be under 100, some are saying it should be under 70 with a prior MI.Good luck and I hope someone that can help you more will answer.Jon",

            "answer": "Thank you for your thoughtful reply. I am a retired 70 year old male, 170 cm tall and weigh about 125 lbs. In general I don't have angina by doing routine daily activities. I walk for about 45 mins every day at a normal pace.I believe if I walk briskly for the same duration I might have angina. I have had angina in the past when I carried a weight of 35 lbs for about 15 mins.Not sure if my diabetes could also be masking the angina.",

    "question": "Thank you very much for your review of this post. I wanted to see if a CABG is necessary or strict diet, exercise and medical control of my condition has the likelihood of decreasing any cardiac events and possible reversal of atherosclerosis.I have ruled out PCI/Stents due to various studies that indicate restenoses in a short duration without providing significant advantage of decreasing cardiac events. In addition my angiogram indicates a triple vessel disease, and PCI/Stents seem to be usually unsuitable for my condition.Current Condition - Asian descent, Well controlled Diabetes Mellitus for 20 years, Systemic Hypertension, CHD, LV dysfunction due to Old anterior wall MI 20 years back.Latest blood report showsTotal Cholesterol 178 mg/dlTriglycerides 142 mg/dlHDL Cholesterol 41 mg/dlLDL Cholesterol 125 mg/dlTaking the following tablets:Toprol XL (Beta blocker)Perindopril (ACE inhibitor)Clopidogrel + AspirinIsosorbide MononitrateLipitorI do not have angina with normal activity like walking slowly for about 45 minutes. As part of a routine exam, I had an angiogram recently which shows the following findings:LMCA - NormalLAD - Type III vessel. 70 % Stenosis tapering to 90 %. Mid segment irregularitiesD1 - Has 80 % ostial stenosisLCX - Non-dominant. 50 % long segment stenosis tapering to 70 % followed by mild ectasia. OM2 divides into two branches. Anterior division has 80 % mid stenosis, distally small size. Posterior division 100 % occlusion and is filling antegradely through collaterals.RCA - Dominant. 100 % mid occlusion. Filling antegradely through bridging collaterals.PLB3 - 100 % occlusion and filling retrogradely through left collaterals.Please post your thoughts. I appreciate your time in reviewing this lengthy post.K.",
