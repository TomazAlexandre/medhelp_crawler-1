            "answer": "Hi,Try to avoid scratching to prevent secondary infection. Cold packs, anti-itch creams and lotion, or\u00a0\u00a0over-the-counter antihistamine medications may help provide relief.\u00a0\u00a0Pruritus or itchy skin may be due to dry skin, irritation, or infection.\u00a0\u00a0Moisturizing regularly may also help. If it persists, have this evaluated further by your doctor for proper management and to rule out other medical conditions such as diabetes,\u00a0\u00a0infection or\u00a0\u00a0hormone problems. A complete medical history and physical examination will help with the diagnosis. The resolution of your symptoms will depend on the underlying condition present.Take care and keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Thanks, Rowena!\u00a0\u00a0That really helps.\u00a0\u00a0Is there a type of lotion that you think is better than others?\u00a0\u00a0Some friends say that natural lotions (with naturally moisturizing oils, etc) are better for the skin, but others say brands like Neutrogena or Eucerin are the best.\u00a0\u00a0THese products typically have petroleum in them, which I have heard it kind of \"addictive\".\u00a0\u00a0Does the skin get used to moisturizers and then depend on them?\u00a0\u00a0I have really dry skin, but maybe my skin would get better if I just stuck it out and got used to not using moisturizing lotion?\u00a0\u00a0What do you think?Thank you so much for your help!!!",

    "question": "I went to Brazil for 1 month and upon return, my skin was really itchy.\u00a0\u00a0When I scratch, my the area of skin that I scratched grew red and elevated, like a big welt (but only exactly where I scratched).\u00a0\u00a0It has been painfully itchy and goes in waves.\u00a0\u00a0It has gotten better over the last few weeks, but my skin is still really sensitive.\u00a0\u00a0I did get a lot of sun in Brazil, so I thought that my skin was just sensitive from the sun, but it looks like there is more to it than that.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone ever experienced this before?\u00a0\u00a0What do you do to stop the itching and get your skin back to normal?",
