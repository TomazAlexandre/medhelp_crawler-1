            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Erection is caused by a combination of emotional and physical factors. Natural sexual arousal sends signals to the brain which inturn through muscles, nerves, hormones and vessels causes erection.Emotional factors like stress, depression, anger and agression can cause erectile dysfunction. I think in your case these factors are playing a major role. Also supression of erection could have a role to play.Due to some conditions like diabetes, heart disease, hypertension and inadequate blood supply to the penis erectile dysfunction can occur.I don't think there is any major damage. Practise yoga, eat healthy and follow a healthy life style. I think this would help.Take care.",
