    "question": "My stomach was so much better yesterday,\u00a0\u00a0but worse today, havent eaten since Wednesday at 5... so ive had a lot of ivs in the last couple of days. So painful:\"( anyways I'm 24 weeks tomorrow, I'm on kick counts, and my baby is still breeched. Theyre talking about a c section before 40 weeks because my baby may be too big to turn and my stomach is already really hard... but my u.s. tech said my baby was measuring fine... I'm just so scared now and idk im praying for the best in everything. Am I in denial or isnt 24 weeks too early for kick counts and to worry if the baby is still breeched or not..",
