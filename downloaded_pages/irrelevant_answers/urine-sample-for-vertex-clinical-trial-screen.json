            "answer": "They are looking for medical complications that could impact treatment. Things like protein, bilirubin, glucose levels, ketones, etc are markers for a raft of conditions that may be significant in selection.The urinalysis is part of the regular lab panel durign the trial, both during and after tx. Its not taken every lab, but regularly throughout the process. All this is based on Prove 1, of course. Prove 3 may be different, but I'd be surprised if so.",

            "answer": "I'd think it's quite possible they're also screening for illegal drug use, considering it's an excluding factor for the trial. They didn't tell me that specifically, but it wouldn't surprise me they wouldn't mention it for obvious reasons. So if you've been partaking in the wacky weed, I'd cool it and drink lots of cranberry juice or golden seal or whatever that quasi-silly remedy was that everyone used back in high school.",

            "answer": "Its possible [likely??] that they screen for drug use, of course. But its also clear that the screening urinalysis is used as a baseline for monitoring levels during treatment and post-treatment follow-up.In Prove 1, a urinalysis panel was taken several times during tx, and at weeks 4, 8, & 12 post tx. There were no drug tox tests reported on any of those lab results, for what that's worth.",
