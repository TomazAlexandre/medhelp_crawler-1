            "answer": "THIS IS FROM RESEARCH:Not a DOCTOR... But had a few minutes thought this might help!When I first read it I immediately thought yeast infection...Could still be a possobility but after some quick research it appears it could be quite normal!Hope this helps!is vaginal discharge normal?Yes. Glands inside your vagina and cervix make small amounts of fluid. This fluid flows out of the vagina each day, carrying out old cells that have lined the vagina. This is your body's way of keeping your vagina healthy and clean. The discharge is usually clear or milky and doesn't smell bad.The color and thickness of the discharge change with your monthly cycle. The discharge is thicker when you ovulate (when one of your ovaries releases an egg), when you breastfeed or when you're sexually excited.What changes may be a sign of a problem?Changes that may signal a problem include an increase in the amount of discharge, a change in the color or smell of the discharge, and irritation, itchiness or burning in or around your vagina. This is called vaginitis. A discharge that's stained with blood when you're not having your period could also be a sign of a problem. If you have any of these signs, you should talk to your doctor.What can cause these changes?These changes can occur if the normal balance of healthy bacteria (germs) in your vagina is upset. Many things can disturb the balance of a healthy vagina, including douching, feminine hygiene sprays, certain soaps or bubble baths, antibiotics, diabetes, pregnancy or infections.What is a yeast infection?Small amounts of yeast fungus are often found in a healthy vagina. But if too much grows, it can cause a yeast infection. Possible signs of yeast infections are listed in the box below.Yeast infections usually aren't caught from a sex partner. You may be more likely to get a yeast infection if you are using antibiotics, are pregnant, have diabetes, or stay hot and sweaty for long periods. Some women get frequent yeast infections for no obvious reason.",
