    "question": "For the past month I have been falling a lot. I will suddenly become off balance and fall forward. So far I have only received minor injuries, but am worried that I will be hurt worse at some point as I continue to have balance issues. I don't get dizzy during these spells, I just suddenly fall forward. I do have balance issues if I get up quickly but it is no problem as I just sit for a little while before getting up on my feet. I also occasionally\u00a0\u00a0feel dizzy when I am lying down. I don't know what could be causing these symptoms.",
