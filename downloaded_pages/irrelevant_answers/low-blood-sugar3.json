            "answer": "I've been hypoglycemic (have low blood sugar) since I was very little. You need to have peanut butter crackers or some almonds on hand at all times if you're getting low blood sugar. Gum will only help for a little while. Candies and stuff are high in sugar but they don't last as long. The protein in nuts and peanut butter raises your sugar and keeps it up for a good while.",

            "answer": "Every glucose test they've ever done on me came back normal too so I had to learn how to do all this on my own. Regular doctors don't look in to it like they should. You'd have to go to a diabetic specialist to get any real help which your doc won't refer you to if they don't think there's a problem. I've been stuck in this loop for years and finally got help from my ob bc the baby turned my hypoglycemia into gestational diabetes.",
