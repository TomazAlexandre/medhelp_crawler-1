    "question": "I have had itchy scalp and arms that have gradually gotten worse since about 10 months ago. Initially, we had gotten lice a few times from my family, and had taken care of that. I still continue to have scalp and arm itching, which is worse when I am hot, sleeping, or wearing long sleeves. I have been to both a primary care doctor and my dermatologist, who cannot find anything wrong with me. I have tried hydrocortisone, Aquaphor, Eucerin, coal tar shampoos, switching to natural shampoos, using laundry soap made for people with allergies, even replaced our furniture (it was due anyway). I have had a CBC, which has came back normal. My doctor said she did not believe it was scabies. Although she didn't do a test, she said it did not look like that, as I have no great rashes or track marks and it is limited to my arms and scalp. I do have\u00a0\u00a0little red dots that look like blood on my upper arm (a few, hard to see unless up close) and a light rash on upper arms, but she said it was nothing to be concerned about. She thinks it's my nerves, but I have never had that problem before with my depression, and I even tried taking Pristiq again (but had to stop because it was causing shortness of breath).I am going crazy because of this and driving my husband crazy. I cannot enjoy going out or even sleeping. The feeling is also kind of crawling-like sometimes, but again, derm. looked at my scalp and skin and didn't have an answer.Only known allergy is nickel. Current med: Mirena IUD. (which I intend to have removed in Feb. just as a last-attempt cure). I am 5'1 and 200 lbs, but have no problems with high blood pressure or cholesterol according to my tests. Thyroid issues and diabetes runs in my family, but I have tested normal for both. Cancer (breast, bone, other) run in my family too.Any advice or idea on which doctor to try next? We don't have insurance til late February so I am trying to make it through, but I don't know if I can.",
