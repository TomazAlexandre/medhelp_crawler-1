            "answer": "You can not cure PCOS, you will have it for the rest of your life. But, you can relieve some of the symptoms. You and your doctor will work together to come up with an option that best suits you. This can be anywhere from birth control, hormone therapy, diet, exercise, or other options. There are many things you can do to help the situation. Usually with PCOS, when you and your husband have decided to conceive, you and doctor should discuss options. A lot of women tend to turn towards fertility or diabetic mecication to help them conceive. Clomid is a very common one. I wish you luck.",

Some women with PCOS can conceive naturally.\u00a0\u00a0I've had 2 children \"accidentally\" with PCOS but without any treatment (in fact, I tried to conceive for 6+ months with the first of the two and ended up getting pregnant the first month we stopped trying).\u00a0\u00a0Many more women see success with the methods listed above.\u00a0\u00a0PCOS does not necessarily prevent you from having any children - but it will be a longer road to get there.",

    "question": "Hi there,Im new to all of this. I have recently seen a doctor who is sure i have PCOS i have had a pelvic ultra sound but nothing was found. I have suffered from excess body hair, acne and difficulty losing weight for about 6 years. I'm scared because I really want children and im only 24. Is PCOS something you can fix? or are we stuck with it? Im a regular exerciser and eat very healthy food. I don't believe I have diabetes.Is there anyone else out there who has been through this and come out at the other end?Please help I need reassurance.Thanks",
