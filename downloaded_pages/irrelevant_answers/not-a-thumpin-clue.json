    "question": "Ok, hang in there with me while I explain. For the last 4 years I have had all diffrent forms of body symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0The one that has me always on edge,is the pain in the center of my chest, neck, left arm, and jaw line and shortness of breath. Heart attack?\u00a0\u00a0No, Anxiety so they say.But, I am not all that sure. If I have had at least 20 ekg's 1 Echo stress, multiple enzyme tests and lung tests and chest x-rays all negative. I have had every possible panel of blood work performed on me with nothing. They did recently find Type 2 diabities.\u00a0\u00a0I am 38 female not in menapause, yes I am a bit heavy maybe 50 pounds over and I am a social smoker.\u00a0\u00a0I do not drink at all and I have a very stressfull position { aviation}\u00a0\u00a0I guess the question is here, is someone missing something? I know that ER's don't always catch everything but is it possible that somewhere something is not being diagnosed? I say that because of late I have swelling in my legs around the bone area I can pit the skin { some form of edema I am sure} with chest pain, arm pain, neck pain and jaw pain with difficult times to breath.\u00a0\u00a0Yet having gone to the ER two days ago and all the tests yet again...nothing. Is it anxiety over the edema and is the edema being caused by the waight of my tummy on my\u00a0\u00a0thighs? thats what the doctor said, but I am mreally worried about all the symtoms in one.",
