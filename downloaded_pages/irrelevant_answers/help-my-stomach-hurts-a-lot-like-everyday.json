Seen my 17yr old son go through it :/ not good. can be very dangerous and become very painful followed by hospitalization. You will be on straight iv fluids and not be allowed to eat or drink anything! Not even ice chips. I strongly suggest you get in to see your endo asap. Please take better care of yourself.
