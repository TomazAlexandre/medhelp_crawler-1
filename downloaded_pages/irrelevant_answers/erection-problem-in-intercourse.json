You have said that you feel 'fit' when your wife is not around, which indicates that you may have some kind of psychologic problem. This is commonly known as Performance anxiety.The best way forward for you is to keep confidence in yourself and not force yourself to perform. There are many help techniques available, which may help you understand and then perform.In case you are still unable to perform or have problems you may need examination and tests to find out the nature and extent of this problem.Let me know if you may have any other queries.best regards",

            "answer": "Hello,An erection problem is the inability to get or maintain an erection that is firm enough for a man to have intercourse. If the condition persists, the medical term is erectile dysfunction.In many cases, it is a temporary condition that will go away with little or no treatment. If you have difficulty having or keeping an erection more than 25% of the time, it is considered a problem.Common causes causing erection problem are stress and anxiety,poor communication with your partner, unrealistic sexual expectations, which make sex a task rather than a pleasure,negative feelings about non performance,smoking, alcohol and sometimes illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, spinal cord injury, nerve damage (for example, from prostate surgery), or neurologic disorders (such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease).Medications such as blood pressure medications (especially beta-blockers), heart medications (such as digoxin), some peptic ulcer medications, sleeping pills, and antidepressants may also cause erectile dysfunction.http://www.pennhealth.com/ency/article/003164.htmTalk to your partner openly about any fears or apprehensions,eat nutritious healthy food,exercise regularly and cut down on smoking or alcohol if you are taking it.If still a problem then pls get yourself evaluated for the medical conditions mentioned above.Hope it helps.Take care and regards.",
