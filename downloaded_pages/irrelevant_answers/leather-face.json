            "answer": "One thing to remember is every thing you put on your skin, and every toxin you breathe in, as well as all you eat, it ALL has to be processed by the liver.For this reason I have steered clear of creams made with diverse chemicals. I soak in a tepid bath with a Tablespoon on olive oil. It will hydrate your skin, and what makes it to the blood stream is actually good for you. this tx does work, but I've been bad lately and haven't done it for a while and am getting very dried out again.At least while doing this a couple times a week my skin and scalp stopped hurting itching scaling, and my hair all stayed. For the skin but NOT the face anhydrous lanolin is the closest to our bodies own fatty layer, and it can turn leather to lace, but some\u00a0\u00a0folks are allergic to it....you definitely don't want it near your eyes.If you don't like the smell of olive oil you could get a good sunflower or safflower oil that would work as well, but if you buy the light colored olive oil, it hardly has any odor,mb",
