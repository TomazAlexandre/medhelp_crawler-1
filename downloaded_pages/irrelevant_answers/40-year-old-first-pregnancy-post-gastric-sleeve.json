            "answer": "I am 37 years old and pregnant for the first time and I am now 34 weeks pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I had lap band surgery 4 years ago and had lost 90 lbs when I got pregnant. I was also considered high risk bcuz of my age and weigh lost surgery. I had genetic testing done around 15 weeks pregnant and was told everything is great with my baby. Might I add that I also work as an OB nurse for 12 years where we handle mainly high risk patients who have high blood pressure among other issues and I have NEVER seen a baby being born with down syndrome due to high blood pressure or bcuz of age. Ad a matter of fact all the babies I have delivered that have had down syndrome (which have not been probably more than 10 in 12 years) are from very healthy young mothers.\u00a0\u00a0So please don't listen to your friends. If your really worried about it don't make any decisions til after you have seen a genetic specialist and let her be the one to tell you if you are at risk. And as far as you bypass surgery goes there are other ways besides solid food to get your nutrients for you and baby like ensure. Just make sure you eat as healthy as you can when you do eat. Best of luck to you.",

This is truly a great gift.I'm seeing the specialist this friday for more blood test. I think they are testing my hcg level again and for gestational diabetes.They are worried for etopic pregnancy too as they couldn't see the sac at 4weeks plus. From my understanding 4weeks plus is too early to see anything but dr said ay hcg level 2900, we could have seen something. Im really hopefull for good news this Friday.",

    "question": "Hi all. Im 40 years old and this is my 2nd pregnancy. I'm now 5 weeks pregnant and i was just discharged from hospital due to my high blood pressure. My 1st pregnancy ended miscarriage more than 15 years ago. Due to my age, hypertension and asthma history, this pregnancy is considered high risk. In addition, i went for gastric sleeve operation about 2 years ago and i'm not eating as much. During my last hospital stay, 2 diff dr have asked me if I would like to keep the baby. Recently some friends\u00a0\u00a0have telling me that i'm high risk for down syndrome baby. With the daily hypertension medication combo with unhealthy diet.. im now thinking if i'm being selfish.. Feeling emotional. Just want to share.",
