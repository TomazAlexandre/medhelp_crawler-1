            "answer": "Hi and welcome,You don't actually mention if you are diagnosed with MS or if your wondering if 'cold feet' is a symptom of MS.......cold feet is a very common vascular circulation issue, it can also be peripheral nerve related but on it's own, 'cold feet' is not primarily associated with MS. It can be a secondary issue or an additional issue to their MS though eg mobility, injury, medication side effect, diabetes, peripheral neuopathy, Raynauld's, arthritis etcIt's actually very common for someone with MS, to have pseudo relapses with hot temperatures but although it's not very common, some do have pseudo's with cold and or find it hard to warm up once they've become cold etc. I honestly wouldn't be thinking MS is the most likely explanation, even if you are diagnosed with MS simply because it's uncommon and MSers are not immune to additionally experiencing other medical issues.....Cheers........JJ",

            "answer": "I have the opposite experience. My feet often feel like they are on fire when they are not overly warm to the touch. I can't sleep if my feet are covered. My girlfriend eventually gave in and stopped tucking in my side of the bed :-)Kyle",

    "question": "Hi all,Wondering if it's common with MS to feel like your feet are FREEZING....like standing in a snowbank for an hour barefoot freezing....but they are not cold to the touch at all, have good pulses and there is capillary refill, so I know the perfusion is good.",
