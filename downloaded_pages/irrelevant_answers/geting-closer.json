I had to get a c-section with my daughter, my hips and what not are to narrow, I'm really overweight, I went well over my due date with my daughter, and I have gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. told me from the start that I wasn't a very good candidate for a vbac and that it would be safer for me to have another c-section.",

    "question": "I got my c-section scheduled for Aug. 5th. =) As of my last appointment ( 6/14/13). My little boy was 4 pounds 10oz 17inches long @ 32 weeks, heart beat 158. According to my Dr. I'm at a no - low risk of going into preterm labor.\u00a0\u00a0That everything looks good, for baby and myself. I was kinda bummed out that he had his face, facing my lower spine so we couldn't see his face. I don't think he likes his \"picture\" taken, cause the time before that he had his hands covering his face. I go back in 7/5/13. I cant wait!",
