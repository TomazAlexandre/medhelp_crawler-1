            "answer": "Hi NYChronic fatigue could be caused like a lot of things. Since you are being seen by a doctor regarding these symptoms I'm really surprised he didn't test your blood sugar in addition to other things he may be considering. Fatigue is one symptom of diabetes but there are other common ones such as increased urination and thirst, especially at night. Also do you se any patterns with your eating? Like do you feel really \"out of it\" if you go longer than usual without eating? What about if you have a really carb-intense meal (say pasta followed by a rich dessert) Those would be possible symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and hyperglycemia (high blood sugar).\u00a0\u00a0Any weight loss or gain? Any diabetes in your family?I'm going to assume he checked your thyroid.I would ask for a glucose test especially if you answered yes to some of the questions above. Good luck; it's awful to feel bad and not know why, especially when you have such a physically demanding job.",

    "question": "Hello All and Thank You-I am 34 year old white hetero male.\u00a0\u00a0For the past year I have been constantly fatigued and tired, even after waking from 8 hours of good nights sleep.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I have lots of skin problems and seem to become instantly tired after working out or any physical exertion at all.I have even tested HIV negative 6 times out to 1.5 years since a possible exposure to try to find out what is causing these problems for me.\u00a0\u00a0 Having been to primary care doc many many times with no answers as of yet (he did not test for diabetes), I really have no idea what to do to get out of this living hell I have been in for so long.Does anyone know if what I am experiencing could be related to hypoglycemia and/or diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Some days it seems no matter how much sleep I get I am always feeling like I have not slept in days.\u00a0\u00a0Please if you can provide me with any info it would be GREATLY appreciated.
