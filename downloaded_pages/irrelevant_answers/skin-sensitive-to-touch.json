            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Unexplained pains, sometimes the bones paining and sometimes the muscles can be due to a problem called \u2018fibromyalgia\u2019. This is associated with fatigue and a heightened and painful response to gentle touch (allodynia). Other symptoms include\u00a0\u00a0needle-like tingling of the skin, nerve pain, muscle aches and spasms, weakness in the limbs, functional bowel disturbances, and chronic sleep disturbances. Although fibromyalgia usually presents with chronic widespread pain, pain may also be localized in areas such as the shoulders, neck, low back, hips, or other areas.The cause of fibromyalgia is often hereditary or due to a physical or emotional trauma or due to lingering infection in the body such as due to mono. The treatment is a mix and match of analgesics, anti depressants, anti seizure medications, physical therapy and counseling.It can also be due to extreme fatigue caused by anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism or due to anxiety.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Anytime I am grabbed or touched a little more roughly then normal it hurts more than most people. I am always saying \"ouch\" and can feel where i was hit for about 5 minutes after. I am not being beaten or punched. It is normal messing around with family and friends that ends up really hurting me. My boyfriend thinks there is something wrong with my nerves...could that be an issue?",
