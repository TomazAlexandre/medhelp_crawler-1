    "question": "I am a 20 year old female who has multiple symptoms and I am wondering if they could be connected.\u00a0\u00a0I was hoping that someone will recognize all of these symptoms or share an experience similar to mine etc. The first of these started 6 months ago and has been gradually getting worse. I am experiencing :- swollen ankles and feet (not made any better or worse by exercise or movement)- constant abdominal/ lower back pain ( started two weeks ago)-chronic fatigue-sores in the nose-decrease in urination- headaches and dizzinessNow as I said I'm not sure if any of these are connected. But if anyone has any idea what I am dealing with, your opinion would be appreciated.Thanks.",
