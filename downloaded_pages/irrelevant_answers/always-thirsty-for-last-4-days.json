            "answer": "Hello~Yes, 94 is a very good normal level for fasting,\u00a0\u00a0however, to really be sure if it is diabetes, you need the 6 or 8 hour glucose tolerance test. They take a fasting level, then, you drink a glass of glucola or some liquid with a lot of sugar in it, then, they re-check in a half hour, then after that, every hour for the remainder of the test. It is no fun, but very accurate.It could also be dehydration, a person needs to drink at least 6 to 8 ounces of water a day, and, if you live in a hot climate, you need to make sure you are drinking this much if not more.Have you been under any stress? Stress will sometimes cause abnormal thirst as well.Good luck and please keep us posted as to how you are doing.Susie",

            "answer": "I can relate to what you are describing.\u00a0\u00a0At around the same time as you, i experienced a severe thirst - it is different to the thirst associated with diabetes, fever, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I would wake up in the middle of the night and drink two cups of water and stil be very thirsty.\u00a0\u00a0As this progressed, i developed a dry cough and then apprx 7 days latter, it turned into a wet cough. However, it never got very chesty and i didnt have a sore throat - if anything, my glands feel a bit swollen now. I would also have one day i felt good and then the next day i was very tired. This has also been playing havoc with my eyesight - which suggests i am still dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0Around the same time as my dry cough developed into my wet cough, i experienced bouts of being unable to breathe directly after i stopped coughing. It is like the bronchial tubes just closed right up.\u00a0\u00a0this gradually got worse and would leave me gasping for breath for up to 30 secs.\u00a0\u00a0It was like the flap at the back of the neck just closed over the wind pipe (yes i have experienced sleep aponeoa where this can happen) I did experience minor retching but did not have a great deal of phlegm as with other influenzas (and i have had a few of the bad ones these past years).\u00a0\u00a0Someone suggested i may have whooping cough so i am waiting on my blood results.\u00a0\u00a0I did hear the radio anouncer on Triple JJJ yesterday describing the same symptoms as i have had - the doctor looked at me blankly when i described them - so the radio anouncer (Sydney based) made me feel better as he said he knew a lot of people with it.\u00a0\u00a0He said he seemed to think he had had swine flu.\u00a0\u00a0I would also like to hear more from other people if they have been diagnosed.",

    "question": "I have been severely thirsty for the last 4 days. Can't get enough to drink. I literally drink down a\u00a0\u00a0glass of water or juice. Wake up thirsty during the night. Not to hungry, I do eat a little though and urinating VERY often. Thought maybe I had\u00a0\u00a0dehydration, now concerned after 4 days.\u00a0\u00a0Scared it is diabetes.",
