            "answer": "Hi there,Im on seroquel as well. I had the same question too at one point. Seroquel does cause you to gain weight regardless of eating, and this is because seroquel effects the pancreas, which is responsible for insulin regulation. Disturbed insulin regulation can lead to food cravings, weight gain..and diabetes. Insulin helps with breaking food down to glucose, the bodies natural sugar that is fed to our bodies cells to give us energy.Food probably plays a role too.",
