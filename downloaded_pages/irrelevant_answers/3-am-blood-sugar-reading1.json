            "answer": "Hi, first, welcome to this forum. I'm glad you posted.Its time you saw another doctor. For a doctor to discourage glucose testing unless the patient is on insulin is horribly wrong. He/she sounds like a quack. It is important to monitor your blood sugar (glucose) on a regular basis to understand how well you are controlling your diabetes. Your above 300 mg/dl readings are high and getting real close to a dangerous level where diabetes complications start to set in. I'll get back to when to test your glucose further down in this thread.Here's what's important and should be your everyday guideline - Eat well balanced meals in the correct amounts, along with moderate exercise (like walking) and weight control, you can keep your blood glucose level as close to normal (non-diabetes level) as possible. Small meals throughout the day are better than three huge meals. Your body will better handle the smaller amounts.Foods:Stay away from foods containing sugar and bad carbs. Google bad carbs for a list no-no foods. Do not snack before bedtime or when waking in the middle of the night. Limit, if any, your soda, tea, and coffee intake. Drink lots of water. I don't consume any sugar, especially foods containing raw sugar. Sugar and me do not get along. Succralose (Splenda) is an alternative sweetener that I use that does not get digested so it does not enter your blood stream. Its a sugar derivative.Exercise:The easiest exercise is walking. Walking really helps to reduce glucose levels. In winter it's hard. Try to find a gym or use a stationary bicycle, for example, in place of walking.Weight Control:Being overweight contributes greatly in high glucose. Lose weight and you'll lower glucose.Testing:1. Test first thing in the morning before having a meal or colored liquids to drink. This is called fasting (prandial) testing and should be between 8 to 10 hours after your last meal. No snacking in between these times.2. Test 2-4 hours after your meal3. Test before lunch & dinner4. Repeat steps 2 & 3Start a log book of your test results and the type of food consumed. If you see that certain foods causes a rise in your post meal (postpranadial) reduce the amount or eliminate them from your diet. Once you understand which foods are good and which ones are bad for you, you can reduce the testing. I'm at zero unless I consume certain foods. For example; pasta - tomato sauce has sugar and raises my glucose levels at times, not always, but most of the time, so I test.I hope this helps. Post back if you have further questions.",

            "answer": "Ditto on changing doctors. Have you calibrated your home meter, the test strips and/or checked for expiration dates? I say this because its known for home meters to go astray with inaccurate results. Expired test strips also will be inaccurate. If interested I can post a Johnson & Johnson web page for free home glucose meter.And lots of good diabetes recipes on the Internet. Do a Google search.",

            "answer": "Thanks to both of you.As far as I know, the meter is OK and the test strips are well within expiration.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor is very, very hesitant to write a prescription for test strips, so I buy them.\u00a0\u00a0It's absurb because with my insurance I could test four times a day free.\u00a0\u00a0As it is now, I really hoard the test strips.Yes, I try to watch the carbs and sugars, though I fell off the wagon during the Christmas days and that's probably why I'm showing the higher numbers.\u00a0\u00a0I also have a Golden Retriever (named Katie -- thus the GoldenKatie nickname) and we walk most every day for at least a mile.\u00a0\u00a0I know I would do better with less weight and I work on that.Thanks for your help.",

            "answer": "Katie,if these are really your levels, your doctor is failing to treat you properly.\u00a0\u00a0And sounds as if you are generally doing the lifestyle things you need, so you probably need some adjustments in meds and/or to be considering insulin.What is your HA1c level?Please change drs.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor is doing you a big disservice by not encouraging you to be active in your own management.Best wishes...",

    "question": "I'm a novice when it comes to diabetes so I could use some help.\u00a0\u00a0I'm on 2.5mg of Glipizide and have been for about four years.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor discourages blood glucose testings -- says that's only necessary if I were on insulin.\u00a0\u00a0However, I will occasionally check my blood sugar -- maybe once or twice a month or if I'm not feeling well.I checked it on Sunday and found it was running somewhat high.\u00a0\u00a0Just for the heck of it, I checked it when I went to bed and it was 336 around 10 p.m.\u00a0\u00a0I happened to wake up at 3 a.m. to use the restroom and thought I would check it again since it was kind of high when I went to bed.\u00a0\u00a0I expected to see a substantial drop in number (is that correct)?\u00a0\u00a0It was 317.I checked a couple of times throughout the day yesterday and it continued to run somewhat high.\u00a0\u00a0At 10 p.m. it was 274 and again I woke up this morning around 3 a.m. and checked it.\u00a0\u00a0It's at 252 now.I thought the 3 a.m. reading should be substantially lower than the daytime readings.\u00a0\u00a0Is this correct??\u00a0\u00a0I was surprised to find it had not dropped significantly??I don't want to talk to my doctor about this because I would have to admit I did a testing.\u00a0\u00a0Any information would be appreciated.Thanks",
