            "answer": "A program will work if you work the program as written.Eat only lean meats, fat free dairy, whole grains, fruits and veggies, and eat very little to NO highly processed foods.\u00a0\u00a0No excuses.\u00a0\u00a0Rid your house of pretzels, cookies, chips, candy, sugary or highly processed breakfast cereals, and fatty foods of any type.\u00a0\u00a0Your family and child can benefit greatly from learning this way of eating, too.Walk 3 or 4 times a week, do whatever simple exercises you feel you can.\u00a0\u00a0Anything is better than nothing.\u00a0\u00a0If you have problems with your joints in your lower body, for now do arm and upper body exercises.\u00a0\u00a0Or vice versa.\u00a0\u00a0If you can only walk to the mailbox, by golly, walk there every day, and soon you will be able to start adding a few more steps little by little.My husband was on Metformin, and lost over 40 pounds this way.\u00a0\u00a0He is now off his meds, both for diabetes and hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0 You can do it too!I'm not sure how long ago you did WW.\u00a0\u00a0The program has changed quite a bit in the last couple of years.\u00a0\u00a0I do the Core program, which involves eating as I described above.\u00a0\u00a0My husband eats that way by default, b/c I don't plan or prepare anything else.\u00a0\u00a0We've both learned how and why to eat.But any sensible program THAT YOU FOLLOW EXACTLY will work for you, insulin resistance or not, PCOS or not.\u00a0\u00a0Many programs have thousands of women with these conditions that have been very successful.Best of luck to you in starting off a healthy life in whatever way you feel would work for you.",

            "answer": "I agree with peekawho, WW does work you just need to be patient. I have a very bad back and fibromyalgia. My dr stresses yoga and walking. Do to my fibro activity has been limited, however it is my intent to go back to yoga. I also have a Susan Sansone walking DVD that is excellent.I also have pre-diabetes. My dr put me on metformin at the end of December and I have already lost 15 lbs. My dr. is thrilled. I do need to start exercising or my weight will be at a stand still. I do know that my dr is very much for the South Beach diet. He stress little to no carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and keep us informed.Barb",

            "answer": "Thank you for the advice.\u00a0\u00a0I think I am going to do South Beach.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have the money to spend on Weight Watchers anymore, and I did stick to that diet fanatically but I really did need my metformin.\u00a0\u00a0I think part of why I weight gained was I was on and off prednizone the last couple years.\u00a0\u00a0I am goign to refuse to take it anymore, unless absolutely necessary.\u00a0\u00a0I have an autoimmune disease, so sometimes it is necessary unfortunately.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor said without the medicine I am currently on, the metformin, was why I couldn't lose weight, and because I had diabetes for last couple years unchecked.\u00a0\u00a0She is really mad at my OBGYN for just dismissing me with a single blood strip test for not having diabetes after having gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor said the OBGYN should have had me in again a couple months later to check my 90 day blood sugar levels and do a glucose tolerance test and other stuff or told me to see my regular doctor.\u00a0\u00a0She did however say if I had not done Weight Watchers when I did it, I probably would have gained more weight instead, so it is a good thing I did Weight Watchers.\u00a0\u00a0At least I maintained what I did.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor recommended South Beach diet and thinks with diabetes it is an excellent diet to pick since it focuses on carbs and lean meats and watching fats as well as carbs.I think I will skip the phase I of the South Beach diet... my blood sugar levels were going too low when I tried it the first day.\u00a0\u00a0So, I am starting on Phase II instead, and my sugar levels are normal now.\u00a0\u00a0I am not able to do yoga because of my physcial limits, but I am taking up Tai-chi and walking and stair climbing (on my own stairs).\u00a0\u00a0I am glad to hear that you have lost 15 pounds on metformin and South Beach.\u00a0\u00a0I think I will try that because of the diabetes.I agree with peekawho on those processed foods as well.\u00a0\u00a0I have just discarded them because my sister told me to do so yesterday, so I think it is funny you also said it in your message.\u00a0\u00a0Her daughter has diabetes type I, and they raised her girl's blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0In the last couple months she has gone organic and all natural for her daughter.\u00a0\u00a0I am now doing the same.\u00a0\u00a0I also picked up sprouted grain bread which my sister has a lower GI than regular bread.\u00a0\u00a0I also have a friend at church who was a nutritionist many years ago.\u00a0\u00a0She has given me all her books on sugar busters and GI info which has to do with how your body processes certain types of sugar.\u00a0\u00a0The sprouted grain bread does not have any flour in it at all.\u00a0\u00a0It is made with whole grains and it is pretty grainy.\u00a0\u00a0I think it is going to take some getting used to, but that's what I'm doing because I have to and I'm refusing to just ignore stuff because something is yucky.\u00a0\u00a0I luckily have a Trader Joe's near me, so it is cheaper than WHole Foods by a lot.\u00a0\u00a0My sister also told me to get fat free milk instead of 1 or 2% because she thinks homogenization is bad as well, even for diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure why and haven't read about it, but the fat content being 0 in skim milk is a good thing anyways, so I have also made the plunge and also done that.So, this is a really major switch for me.\u00a0\u00a0And in the long run, I will be healthier.\u00a0\u00a0It's just frustrating that I was 140 pounds before I got pregnant which I guess is almost 3\u00a0\u00a0years ago now.\u00a0\u00a0*sigh*\u00a0\u00a0My daughter is 28 months old, so I have to be thinner for her so she has a good female role model in life.\u00a0\u00a0And me eating healthier means she eats healthier, so I guess this was a good thing to happen to me in the long run.\u00a0\u00a0If I hadn't gained all that weight while pregnant and took it off easily, I wouldn't be switching my diet completely around now, which means my daughter's diet would not be switched around either.\u00a0\u00a0She doesn't need all those carbs either.\u00a0\u00a0And the all natural, home made foods, much better for her as well.\u00a0\u00a0I am no longer going to buy pre packaged anything, have bought a crock pot and a vegetable steamer/rice cooker, so I can steam fresh veggies.\u00a0\u00a0I am homemaking my own soups.\u00a0\u00a0Or will be soon since I just got recipes.\u00a0\u00a0My husband is totally on board for all this, and let me buy all the stuff at the store this week.So, all in all, I keep having to tell myself, that this is a good thing that is happening in my life, not a bad thing.\u00a0\u00a0And I am going to stick to the South Beach Diet completely, and take my meds every night and not skip any doses (I've done that in the past with other medications but will not do it now).",

            "answer": "Hi peekawho,I dont think you need to follow a diet plan like the south beach diet, the simple way to have a low carb, healthy diet is to have lunch and dinner plates as follows - half veggies, quarter protein (chicken, turkey and fish are lowest cals) and quarter carbs (like you say the brown rice/bread/pasta or good potatoes like boiled or baked). Protein is the good alternative to carbs in that it slowly releases energy so you should consider this and fruit/veg the most important part of your daily diet. Snacks like you said are then grains, pulses, fruit, raw veg and low fat dips (not bought as they have heaps of sugar and other stuff), yogurts etc.This is free and easy to follow, im sure you have recipe books at home, pick what you like then make it up with the correct ration of protein carbs and fruit/veggies.",

    "question": "My doctor told me I've had problems losing weight the last couple years (haven't lost any really) because of PCOS (something about polycystic ovarian something or other) and because of my diabetes and insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0I can't take stuff that would speed up my metabolism or diet pills because I also have an autoimmune disease (mixed connective tissue disorder) and the doctor is afraid it might mess up my thyroid function or something so won't prescribe any weight loss medication.\u00a0\u00a0Being on metformin for my diabetes I have dropped about 6 pounds in the last 6 weeks, since my blood sugar levels are more under control.\u00a0\u00a0That's a lot better than before.\u00a0\u00a0Is it just going to take a long time?\u00a0\u00a0So, I am if weight watchers won't take the weight off (not to mention throwing my money away every week having done that), what type of diet will work?\u00a0\u00a0I can't do too low carb, but I have cut the carbs way down because of the diabetes, but don't know how far to push it.\u00a0\u00a0So, I'm a little over 200 pounds and am 5'5\".\u00a0\u00a0And what kind of low impact exercise is good if you have joint issues?\u00a0\u00a0I am only 34, but with my health issues sometimes I feel like I'm more like 80 or 90.\u00a0\u00a0I gained 90 pounds being pregnant (gestational diabetes which turned in to full blown diabetes) two years ago, and before that, I was normal weight.\u00a0\u00a0I have been watching calories the last two years, maintaining a diet of around 1200 to 1400 calories, but the doctor said that caloric intake with the insulin resistance thing was not going to help me, it's the carbs.\u00a0\u00a0So, how do you do a South Beach or Zone type diet with getting enough to have energy to chase after a 2 year old with boundless energy and not pass out?Well, I guess before when I was normal weight, I was eating too many carbs and sugar\u00a0\u00a0heavy stuff, so I guess it's better I had a wake up call gaining 90 pounds during my pregnancy to get me to start eating healthier.\u00a0\u00a0And even though I am overweight, I am eating healthier now than I was 2 to 3 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0But, it's still depressing to be 80 pounds or so overweight.",
