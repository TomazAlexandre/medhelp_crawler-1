            "answer": "Aside from urinary frequency and numbness/tingling of feet, are you experiencing any other symptom? Any symptom of increased drinking and eating? Any signs of weight loss? Do you have a family history of diabetes? It would be advisable to have your blood sugar level checked to rule out this condition.While there may be no back pain, it is still possible that some other underlying condition in your spine may be related to both the urinary and neurologic symptoms. I would advise you to go through with the MRI.",

            "answer": "If the symptoms occur at the same time there is always the possibility that they are related. It is also entirely possible for urinary symptoms to be caused by spine conditions because the nerves that control the urinary bladder do pass through the spine. However, nothing is certain at this point. In the meantime, follow your neurologist's advice for an MRI to be done.",

            "answer": "Sorry to hear about your symptoms and how it is not taken seriously. I think that MRI is a good idea too as lower back disk problems can certainly cause bowel/bladder problems and numbness, tingling. Some people get sciatica and only feel that disk pain in the buttock or thigh. It seems you would likely have some pain if it were your back but that MRI should tell you. You may be onto something about the nerve problem since it has occurred after your surgery. This is unrelated, butmy father has had neuropathy in his legs for some years, no diabetes but other problems. Lately he says when his feet tingle it subsides as soon as he urinates. He was treated years ago with implanted radiation seed therapy for prostate cancer so I wondered about scar tissue with him. He has many problems, Parkinson's, now some fluid in his brain they can't figure out, also wondered if that was causing pressure and symptoms on bladder too like hydrocephalus can. I do know that in researching the spinal fluid problem in his brain that people end up seeing many doctors before finding answers so don't give up and keep searching for help. There is a book called\u00a0\u00a0America's Top Doctors, a Castle Connolly Guide, perhaps you could find a really good gynecologist and neurologist for a second opinon. Good Luck!",

    "question": "I am getting desperate. I am 62 and\u00a0\u00a0had an abdominal hysterectomy 2 months ago because of large fibroid tumors.\u00a0\u00a05 weeks after the surgery, I started having two symptoms at the same time\u00a0\u00a0- urinary frequency and numbness/tingling in both of my feet, mostly in my right big toe and right foot but slightly in the left.\u00a0\u00a0I went to urologist who discounted the foot problem\u00a0\u00a0and went to a neurologist that has discounted the bladder problem.\u00a0\u00a0I strongly feel they are related.\u00a0\u00a0I am on pyridium for the bladder spasms but it is only slightly helping. The neurologist has me scheduled for an MRI for my thoracic and lumbar even though I don't have any back pain.\u00a0\u00a0My gyne is totally ignoring the entire situation.I'm thinking I have an entrapped nerve from the surgery scar tissue that is causing both the bladder and foot problem.\u00a0\u00a0No one wants to address this.\u00a0\u00a0Question:\u00a0\u00a0Whom can I go to to see this through as the bladder and foot numbness is driving me crazy.\u00a0\u00a0How can I convince a doctor to test this theory.\u00a0\u00a0My bladder tests came out negative as I think the MRI will.Thank you!!!!",
