            "answer": "I found out I had it during week 29 and I am now 35.5 weeks. I am diet controlled but some women need extra help like medication or insulin. Advice I can give is protein and veggies are now your best friend. You can have carbs but they have to be small portions and monitored. Eat every 2 hours during the day. Some foods will make you spike and everyone is different in how food choices effect them. Light exercise such as walking before or after meals can help regulate your blood sugar. Just remember you are not alone. There are tons of support groups out there to help you. Warm wishes for you and your baby!",
