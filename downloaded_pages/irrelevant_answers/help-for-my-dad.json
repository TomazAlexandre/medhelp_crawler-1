            "answer": "First and foremost your father needs to control and manage his diabetes to prevent diabetes side effects. You don't mention what this is, or what his levels are, so I cannot provide suggestions.However, I dislike doctors who dispense drugs like candy instead of finding the cause and cure of the health issue/concern. All drugs have side effects, some nastier than others. I wouldn't be surprised that your father is taking medication to counteract the side effects of a previous drug/s. Then it becomes a domino affect as he is Rx'd more drugs. Weeding him off drugs would be a good start.Perhaps a second medical opinion is in order, someone who is not associated with his current doctor. If you live near a major college university more than likely a teaching hospital is located near or on the campus. This is where medical experts teach AND practice medicine. First have him see an Endocrinologist, a specialist on diabetes and the endocrine system. Then go from there. Good luck",

    "question": "My dad has type ll diabetes, he is 60 yrs old and in the past year his health has gone completly down hill. He can hardly walk, he shakes really bad, his arms and legs jerk. He lost his sight in his left eye and has trouble seeing out of his right eye. He falls alot, he is very weak, and has lost alot of weight, he has no muscle tone. His doctor has him on so many different meds, Im not sure if his meds are causing this. Just a little over a year ago he could see fine, he was driving, fishing, and fixing up his boat, Im not sure why all this is happening and why it happened so fast. I love my dad more than anything, I pray someone can help.",
