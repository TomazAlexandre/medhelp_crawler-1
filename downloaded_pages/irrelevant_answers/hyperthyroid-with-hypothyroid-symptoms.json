            "answer": "Your T3 is part of the puzzle. Do you know what it is? Your TSH is ''midly'' low, and doesn't suggest hyper based on your T4. They will not treat you for hyper based on those labs. I suggest you have all three thyroid antibodies tested to give you a better picture. I would also google central hypothyroidism.TSI-graves markerTPO(seen in graves and hashimotos)ATG( elevated leveal mainly seen in hashimotos)",

            "answer": "Armywife mentioned the need to know T3.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to make sure that you realize the full importance of testing for free T3 (FT3, not total T3).\u00a0\u00a0FT3 is the biologically active thyroid hormone that largely regulates metabolism and many other body functions.\u00a0\u00a0You should request that it be tested and if the doctor resists, then insist on it and don't take no for an answer.\u00a0\u00a0You are the customer.\u00a0\u00a0If your FT3 is just in the lower end of its reference range, that is frequently consistent with having hypo symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0The so-called \"normal\" range does not assure everything is okay, symptom wise.Another thought is that your low TSH and hypo symptoms may signal the need for pituitary function testing.Be aware that not all Endos are good thyroid doctors.\u00a0\u00a0Many specialize in diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Many have the \"Immaculate TSH Belief\" and don't want to pay any attention to other, more important tests.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest that you ask the doctor if he is going to be willing to treat you clinically (for symptoms), by testing and adjusting FT3 and FT4, with meds as necessary to relieve symptoms, without being constrained by resultant TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0 You should also ask if the doctor is willing to prescribe meds other than T4 types.\u00a0\u00a0If the answer to either is no, then you will probably have to keep looking for a good thyroid doctor that will treat you clinically.",
