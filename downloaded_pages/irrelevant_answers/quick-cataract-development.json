    "question": "Untill this year I was lucky enough to have excellent sight ~ (apart from colour blindnes). In Feb. I had an eye test & had reading glasses prescribed, I was assured that there were no cataracts or other problems. In May I noticed that my eyes were not in synch. After another test in was referred to the Eye Dept. of local hospital, where the Doc. found both eyes had cataracts. An appointment's been made for me to have an appointment prior to Catarct Surgery.My question is : Is such a rapid onset of Cataracts 'normal?' I'm taking anti-depressants, perhaps they have an influence?If anyone with direct experience of having cataracts treated can give me any suggestions about anything helpful that I should know about I'd appreciate the information. Regards, George",
