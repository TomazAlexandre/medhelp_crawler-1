    "question": "It's a BOY! My husband and I are literally in shock. We thought for so long he was a girl, and now we feel bad! Lol. Now I'm trying to get used to thinking of my baby as a boy, and i get happier the more I think about it. My sister is almost ready to pop and she is having a girl so she's definitely happy we're having a boy. But with this news came bad news. The doctor said sense I couldn't finish my second glucose test(I threw up after an hour), she has to assume I have gestational diabetes. So she gave me a prescription for the monitor and strips and such and wants me to start monitoring asap. The problem is my insurance got cancelled last week and I have no idea why. My dhs worker has no idea why either. But I reapplied last night online for it and informed my dhs worker so she can speed the process up faster so I can get what I need. Also, that hospital bill would be terrible to have if I was to go into preterm labor and didn't have insurance. And obviously the chances of preterm labor have gone up sense I have gestational diabetes. And the risk of needing a c section. Which makes me very nervous but I will do everything I can to keep the baby and myself healthy for the rest of my pregnancy. I have contacted my health department also to see if they can help with the monitor and such until my insurance is back on, but havnt gotten through to them yet. Tomorrow I am 30 weeks so only 10 more weeks to go! I start diabetes counceling Thursday. Has anyone had gestational diabetes and not go into preterm labor? Is it something that happens most of the time? Some insight would be appreciated. Thanks for listening :)",
