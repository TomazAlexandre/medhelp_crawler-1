            "answer": "I do not have diabetes, but have been diagnosed with low testosterone. Viagra does not seem to work for me at all. I have attempted sex with an old high school girlfriend since I started having the ED, I find her sexually stimulating.....but, even with Viagra up to 100 mg., I cannot achieve a fully rigid erection sufficient for penetration. I don't want to go on HRT, but am wondering if there is something I am missing that I could try to improve my erectile function.",

    "question": "If you are essentially celibate because you are in a marriage with an asexual partner, can you lose the ability to achieve erection after an extended period of time, (as in my case of apprx. 16 months), due to psychosomatic influences? I guess I know I will never again have sex with this woman but cannot see myself leaving the relationship due to financial and other considerations. I still attempt masturbation but cannot achieve a full erection. I am, however, still able to reach orgasm and ejaculate.",
