Like all diseases, there are hundreds of medicine men touting a miracle cure, a thousand year old Chinese remedy, or new found discovery that no one in the medical filed has heard of.From the back of a covered wagon in the 1800's to today's internet, its all the same game, take your hard earned $$.",

            "answer": "Hi, I have to disagree with the previous poster. While I'm not using the word Cure, there certinly is help in the way of herbs, diet and exercise. Each person is different and how they react to different remedies may be different so what helps or works for one person may not bring the same results in another. A lot would depend on whether you are borderline or more in the range that requires Insulin ( higher numbers ). Do your research and read whatever is available to make an informed decision yourself.For myself, I now, after going off Avandia, have an average of 99. I watch my diet, walk and exercise daily and have lost abt 20 lbs . My Dr put me immediately on Avandia but with the inexcusable news of\u00a0\u00a0the possibility of its affecting ones heart, i stopped using it.My new Dr. questioned my ever being on it in the first place. I can understand being put on meds if your numbers are really high, at least until you get things under control but as we are all finding out almost daily the new meds are not being tested as they should be or the drug companies are lying about the side effects so\u00a0\u00a0it would seem the Drs ( if they really have our best intrest at heart ) would try the natural remedies first, then if theydon't work go on to meds.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately that isn't the way it works ------ no money in that!As for what i use, now it is Cinnamon with my meals, and Beta sitosterol, also an assortment of vitamins/herbs including\u00a0\u00a0CoQ10, Fish Oil, Vit C, Cranberry Capsuls, Sylimarin ( to support the Liver ) , garlic,. I also include Blueberries and other berries/ fruits in my diet.",

    "question": "Hey guysI was looking up information on diabetes and I came across this article about doctors lying to their patients about diabetes treatments. The article also goes on to talk about natural cures for diabetes. I didn\u2019t know this but there\u2019s a rule that doctors are not allowed to talk about natural cures or anything \u201ctermed\u201d a miracle cure to there patients even if they believe it the best means of treatment. I was shocked when I saw the STATS on diabetes in America. It\u2019s really horrific.Here\u2019s a little snippet from the article.\u201cThe diabetes epidemic has snuck up on us and become the sixth-leading cause of U.S. deaths: Over 200,000 in 2002. And it's only getting worse.If you are between 40 and 74 then there's a 30% chance you're already diabetic or pre-diabetic. If a 30% risk doesn't disturb you, check your pulse. If you eat like an average American, chances are 8% that you already have full-blown diabetes-and about 40% that you're pre-diabetic...and barreling full speed down the highway to sugar hell.\u201dHere\u2019s a link to the article if you want to read the rest of it.http://www.diabetesresourcecentre.com/What-Causes-Diabetes/Signs-Of-Pre-Diabetes.phpHas anyone had success with any natural remedies? Please have a read. I would really like to get any thoughts on this.",
