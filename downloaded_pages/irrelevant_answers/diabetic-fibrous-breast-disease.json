    "question": "I am a type 1 diabetic and have been diagnosed with Diabetic Fibrous Breast Disease, bilaterally.\u00a0\u00a0The first doctor I saw recommended a mastectomy with reconstruction which was something I was not willing to undergo.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor I recently saw for a second opinion arranged for me to have an MRI which I have just had performed.\u00a0\u00a0It was her further recommendation that I should have an actual core biopsy performed on each breast to rule out cancer (I had a needle aspiration on each side which showed benign cells, but the doctor feels this is not 100% conclusive even though she is not suspicious that the masses are truly cancerous).My question is this - is it feasible to have the entire mass removed in each breast and then have implants put in (in one surgery)?\u00a0\u00a0If I am going to have a biopsy, I feel I would like the entire mass to be removed from each side; however, in doing so I think an implant would become necessary from an aesthetic standpoint.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have any experience with this?",
