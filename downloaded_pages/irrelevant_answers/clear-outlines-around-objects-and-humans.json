There is many more sighting and reports of them occurring most frequently whereas the bible states there is nothing new. Meaning they are getting bolder showing their selves.",

    "question": "This is going to seem like an odd question. But i can not find answers anywhere else so I wonder if the medical community has answers. I have noticed that sometimes if I look close enough at objects especially people I can see like a very very very faint transparent outline around them. its been happening for a long time now. My boyfriend says he can see it to if you look hard enough. it follows the contours of the objects. its mostly visible around humans. What is this? I think its very interesting because Im not a big believer in the spirt world. I dont disbelieve either but I assume there must be some medical explanation for it. I wonder if its energy or light reflecting. People say auras but Im not even sure if auras really exist. do you happen to know if the medical world explains this?",
