            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!With your symptoms you should check out for a few things, namely diabetes, acidity, GERD, and hormonal imbalance of menopause.\u00a0\u00a0All these problems can cause the symptoms you are having, in addition diabetes can be responsible for the cellulitis not healing.
