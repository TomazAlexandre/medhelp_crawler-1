            "answer": "Lyme Disease would be something to look into. Lyme Disease can cause all the symptoms you have. Doctors never think to check for it, and the testing for it is so inaccurate. Lyme Disease tests only pick up on 50% of cases of it.Many people go through years and years of symptoms with no answers before they find out they have Lyme Disease. Lyme Disease suppresses the immune system, causes inflammation, pain, and since it is a bacteria, it causes infections.I know from personal experience because I had symptoms ever since I was about 12 and didn't find out I had Lyme Disease until I was 23. I became so sick that I looked into every possibility since doctors all told me my blood work all came back fine for everything.You really do have to take matters into your own hands. There is a Lyme Disease section right here on MedHelp. I would post in there. The people on that forum are very knowledgable. Good luck!",

    "question": "Hello, everyone!I have what I suppose is a general health concern and I am unsure where to turn for help or if it is cause for concern at all.I am 26 now and since early childhood (4-5+) I have been recurrently sick. I had a very good childhood and a very healthy home. My mother constantly prepped fresh foods, the house was spotless and dust free, etc. There wasn't any abuse and everyone got on really well.However, I was constantly fatigued and had trouble concentrating\u00a0many times. I was still an honor roll student and in gifted classes, but sitting to read or do homework was miserable for me. I just chalked it up to having a different learning style?I also came down with a lot of nose bleeds and frequently had a cold. As I grew older, I had muscle aches, especially my back.\u00a0Plenty of UTIs, kidney stones, and even a few yeast infections in my teen years.I did \"blossom\" early -- age 7 I began to grow breasts and at 9 I had my first period. Those periods were HORRIBLE.At the age of 21, I was officially diagnosed via surgical laparoscopy with endometriosis.My fatigue, body aches, stomach upset, headaches, and constant colds have continued.I do have very mild psoriasis\u00a0and even as a child, I had trouble in physical activities because I would become winded and my legs would grow weak or tired very rapidly. This continues and physical activity can be difficult because of the breathing and of how fast my legs tire.I have had multiple blood panels/workups done by doctors for anemia, thyroid, vitamin deficiency, diabetes/pre-diabetes, etc... But everything is perfect on paper.This is becoming extremely quite frustrating. I just would love to feel 100% for one day. I have no idea what that is like.Can anyone think of anything? Any suggestions at all?",
