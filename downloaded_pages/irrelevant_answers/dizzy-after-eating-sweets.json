            "answer": "As we age our body goes through changes that we never experienced before. Foods/liquids we once consumed may no longer be tolerated by our body. In your case, your pancreas may not be able to produce insulin fast enough (just a guess) to keep up with sugar contents of those juices. If they make you dizzy do as you doc said, stop.",

    "question": "Is there a diabetic or pre-diabetic condition that causes dizziness when consuming large quantities of sugar, or is it probably more related to my age?I'm 59, male,\u00a0\u00a05'10\" 175lbs. I'm on Metroprolol 25mg once per day. No diabetes in my family, no other major health problems except heart arrhythmia requiring a pacemaker to manage it.I test for diabetes every 6 months or so, including a glucose tolerance test. Tests are always negative.I don't eat or drink a lot of sweets.\u00a0\u00a0In the past year or 2, I have noticed that when I drink an occasional glass of grape or cranberry juice, I get dizzy. I asked my doc about that, and he said \"well, don't drink the juice\". Recently, I drank a glass of juice, and became very dizzy, so it seems to be worsening.\u00a0\u00a0I used to eat a lot of sweets, and it never made me dizzy before, so it has me puzzled and concerned, because my doc is not exactly a fireball. Or should I just shut up and not drink the juice?Many thanks,,,",
