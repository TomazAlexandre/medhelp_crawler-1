This is a common pediatric complaint and the parents are usually concerned that their child has diabetes mellitus or a UTI. The majority of children are between 4-6 years of age. Pollakiuria is more common than urinary tract infections in children. Symptoms may last for years, but the average length is 7-12 months.Frequent characteristics:1. There is no dysuria and the volumes of urine are small (no polyuria)2. There is no incontinence, dribbling, and the urinary stream is normal3. Although there may be nocturia, it is not to the extent of the daytime frequency.4. There are no changes in bowel habits5. There may be \"stress\" factors identified\"pedclerk.bsd.uchicago.edu/pollakiuria.htmlIf she has polliakiuria, the best course of management would be reassurance and support.Do keep us posted on your doubts and progress.Regards",
