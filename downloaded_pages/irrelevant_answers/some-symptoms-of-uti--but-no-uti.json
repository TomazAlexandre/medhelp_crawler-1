            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!There are a few possibilities for your condition. One is diabetes mellitus or high blood sugar. Second is diabetes insipidus where diluted urine is passed. And the third is non bacterial urinary tract infection. Please consult an internal medicine specialist to rule these out. Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "So I went to the doctor's again today and they did the same urine test and it came up negative for sugar/infection again. My symptoms are still showing however (unfortunately). He sent the urine to the lab for a culture and I'll find out if anything is wrong Wednesday, and if it's still persisting by then I'm going to a specialist.",

    "question": "So for the past several days I've been feeling the urge to urinate frequently and a little bit. I went to the doctor the other day and they tested my urine, and they found that it was completely fine.However things have sort of gotten worse. Before I would either feel the urge to urinate a very little bit 10-20 minutes after I pee(but enough to ignore) or feel the urge a lot about an hour after I go (but end up going a lot).Now, though, I'm feeling the urge to pee a lot 10-15 minute after I go to the bathroom, but not a lot comes out. It's more than a few drops but it's a short stream that doesn't add up to how much I feel it.",
