            "answer": "I believe the acronym is short for intranuclear optic neuritis?\u00a0\u00a0At any rate, what that means is that you either have a lesion on your optic nerve, or in the area of the brain that controls vision.\u00a0\u00a0But most likely a lesion on the nerve - sometimes they can see it on the MRI.And yes, it is related to the MS.\u00a0\u00a0I had optic neuritis as an initial symptom, and my right eye is still different from my left.\u00a0\u00a0It sees colors as faded, light is darker, and I have more nystagmus in that eye.",
