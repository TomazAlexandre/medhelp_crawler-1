            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Commonest cause of nausea is acidity (apart from pregnancy). Take omeprazole (empty stomach in morning) and antacid gel and see if it helps. Liver and kidney dysfunction is another cause. Hence kidney and liver function tests should be done. Other causes are diabetes and hypothyroidism. Electrolyte imbalance too can cause nausea. IBS, gluten or lactose intolerance, parasites in gut too can be the cause. A stool test should be done for worms, giardiasis etc. Also if nothing is found then food challenge test to detect food intolerance should be done.Hope this helps. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
