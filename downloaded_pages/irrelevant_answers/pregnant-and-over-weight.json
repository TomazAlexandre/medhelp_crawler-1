            "answer": "nothing in my book. I started this pregnancy at 214, I am now 17 weeks pregnant and only weigh 215.8 lbs. You just don't want to gain as much since you are overweight. Which really hasn't been an issue for me seeing as I can't eat much right now anyway with the food aversions and nausea, but once I am able to start eating again, it will be healthy.",

I've already gain more then I should have according to the book but I'm not worrying about that now as long as your pregnany goes good.",

            "answer": "I agree wholeheartedly with spade22's response. However, I do have to say that people don't have any right to tell you whether or not you should be having children. But please don't try to lose weight while pregnant. If it happens because you're so sick, that's fine (just keep trying to eat and take your vitamin).I am overweight for my height and I've taken all of that into consideration when TTC. But I have a condition that makes it almost impossible to lose weight, no matter how healthy I eat or how much I exercise. I've been trying to lose weight for over a year and I've only lost 10 lbs. So I'd rather be fat and pregnant than just fat. And if someone has a problem with it, it's honestly none of their business.",

            "answer": "My cousin's wife (now ex-wife) was very big for her height...she weighed over 300 lbs at 5'5. Honestly it was ( I feel bad for saying this but..) like she wasn't pregnant...But she was. Even at 9 months you could barely tell there was a baby. She was just big..and it is frowned upon, but ya know what? She had a perfectly healthy pregnancy. Her son was pretty big like 10 lbs...but he was perfect in all other aspects. He just turned 6 as a matter of fact..And you know what else is ironic? My other cousin (his sister) is very thin and is average height but she got gest. diabetes even though she was very healthy from start to finish and still remains healthy. Strange how the world works.I am overweight myself. I weigh about 155 at 5'2. But I didn't get that way until after I had my miscarriage. I miscarried in Sept of 07 and at the time I weighed 125! Now I look like I am still pregnant but I am not sadly :( I just wanted to say that its okay to be overweight and pregnant as long as its kept within the suggested boundaries. I agree with most joy and spade. Good luck and I hope you have a happy healthy pregnancy!",
