            "answer": "Diabetics often have stent and bypass procedures with good outcomes. The risk of infection is, of course, higher than for others, and good BG control is especially important, as well as for avoiding future issues.I faced this issue 3 years ago with a 95% blockage on the left decending artery, a bit less on the others. I have ben T1 over 40 years. I had angina manefesting as exaustion after mild exercise, though no pain; presumably because of autonimic neuropathy. The cariologist reccomended I try a procedure called EECP (External Enhanced Counterpulsation). This opens collateral arteried to the heart, augmenting blood flow from the main ones.. The procedure cons of 30-45 daily 1 hour sessions with pressure cuffs (like a blood pressure cuff) applied to the legs to force blood back to the heart after each heart beat. I listened\u00a0\u00a0to music during the process, and though it is somewhat uncomfortable, it was bearable and without pain after each session.My exaustion ended after about 15 sessions, and I have no issues today. I get a lot of leg exercise now and control my BG and cholesterol carefully. I have no restrictions on my activity and take no heart meds, other than a small dose of an Ace inhibitor to protect my kidneys.This may not be an appropriate option for you, but it is certainly worth investigating with your cardiologist. There are centers for this procedure all over the country.See www.eecp.com",

            "answer": "Hi -My family has added an EECP machine to our practice.We are typically going to use this for class 3 angina patients.I am 23, and am going to be the 'test' subject to demo the machine for people.Are there any health concerns to putting excess blood pressure on a healthy heart of someone my age?What are some considerations to keep in mind when tuning the machine between the 150-190 millisecond pump timing?How much of the heart fills within this time range? I assume the blood has already filled the heart relatively quickly in a healthy cardio-vascular system. Can this added pressure have adverse effects in the long term? Can you recommend this treatment for lets say athletes or young people with leg pain /RLS type symptoms?As i am not a cardiologist, and don't have one on staff, i have no idea and could use some advice.Thank you!Sam",
