            "answer": "My husband got hep c from blood. He lived 13 years with out a single complaint, never missed a day of work and never touched a drop of alchol. He passed away April 2008 from ruptured varicies. He could never understand how people could drink as worsen the disease. My children have no regrets no doubts that he did everything he could to stay here. He was totally selfless and I am so glad he took care of himself instead of the self pitying disease of alchol. did i mention 2 drunks got a liver before him.",

Second of all, you do NOT know any details, any situations, anything that they may be in! Everyone has their own struggle, their own belief, their own way of comfort and you decide to judge this person who is already going through enough. It just looks bad on you!",

            "answer": "If only it were that simple. My mum was an alcoholic and died from related causes. Was she a no good drunk who didn't care about the effect on her family? Absolutely not. She had issues from past experiences that she struggled to deal with and self medicated with alcohol. I then trained and worked as a drug and alcohol worker and heard some harrowing stories and realised I had no right to judge as if I had gone through some of the tragic experiences some of these people had suffered with, I can't say I wouldn't have turned to something to help me forget either. We never know people's stories, so it is best to save judgement. I'm so sorry for your loss and feel your anger and pain but it's not right or fair to turn it on others who are struggling with their own battles, even one's that appear self inflicted.",
