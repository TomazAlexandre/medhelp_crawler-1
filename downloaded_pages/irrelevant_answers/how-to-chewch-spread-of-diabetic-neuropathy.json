            "answer": "The best approach to controlling diabetic neuropathy is controlling and managing your blood sugars. One must work hard at keeping fasting and postprandial levels as near as normal as possible. What are yours? What was your last A1c?Medications help to relieve pain but they don't work for everyone. What has your Endo said to do?And, tell us more about your \"good glyceamic control.\" Are you eating a diabetic diet?",

            "answer": "Hello,good glycemic control according to the ADA is HBA1C of 7.Good glycemic control necessary to address / prevent / perhaps heal neuopathy would require HBA1C in the mid-low 5s.A totally normal HBA1C for a non-diabetic person is in the range of about 4.3 - 4.6.A lower HBA1C is achievable but requires frequent testing, careful diet and exercise and medications adjustment to avoid both highs and lows.A good reference is \"Diabetes Solutions\" by Dr. Richard Bernstein, a diabetic since he was 12 (now 78), and he was able to reverse his own neuropathy by normalising blood sugars.",

            "answer": "My mother and I have both experienced improvement with our peripheral neuropathy when we started taking vitamin D3 (at least 1000 IU a day is what we take) and vitamin B complex that is in drops or dissolvable tablets that go under our tongue to sink into the blood vessels there. They also have folic acid in those to help absorb vitamin B better. If you take vitamin B pills, stomach acid can destroy most of the vitamin B. Both of those vitamins heal nerve endings and strengthen the central nervous system so effectively, it can help prevent Multiple Sclerosis and worsening nerve pain. My ex was a diabetic and he used a roll-on capsaicin cream that warmed up his feet and got the circulation going to help heal the nerves. I buy all those things at the least expensive site I've ever found, www.iherb.com.Best wishes!",
