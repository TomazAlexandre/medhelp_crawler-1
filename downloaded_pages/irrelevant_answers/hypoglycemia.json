    "question": "Ok. I just recently found out that I'm hypoglycemic. I have a pretty good primary Doctor. But I want a second opinion. She said that with my hypoglycemia, I have the symptoms, but don't need medicine for it, I just need to eat every 2 to 3 hours. So, is that right? Do some hypoglycemics not need medicine to control it? Also, I'm terrified that I will go into a coma or have seizures...so, what can cause these things to happen and is there anything else I need to know about hypoglycemia?",
