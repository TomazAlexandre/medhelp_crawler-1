            "answer": "This sounds a little like Retrograde Ejaculation.\u00a0\u00a0The difference is that you are describing urine in semen while ejaculating rather than semen in urine while urinating.\u00a0\u00a0Have you looked into this as a possiblity?http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/sup/index.htmI am not sure what else it could be, but I would suggest seeing a doctor, especially if it does not clear up quickly.\u00a0\u00a0I did find another reference where someone asked a similar question that I thought you might find interesting:http://www.medhelp.org/forums/urology/archive/976.html",

    "question": "I'm 20 years 6ft 245 lb , I'm having urine present when I ejaculate. I know its urine from the smell. I've been having this for 3 days straight. There seems to be some jello-ish clumps aswell. I have no pain before, during, and after masturbating. Now the first day this happened, I masturbatedwhen I felt I needed to urinate. That was on a full bladder. When I ejaculated urine came out. I'm wondering if I messed something up. Is this a serious problem?",
