            "answer": "Hello,I'm sure this must be so scary for both of you.\u00a0\u00a0It certainly sounds like he is having seizures.\u00a0\u00a0Why I do not know. I too had a dog who had seizures he was diagnosed with Idiopathic Epilepsy.\u00a0\u00a0 The yelping before hand might make you wonder if there is something hurting him that could be causing the seizure, something inside him that the approaching seizure triggers causing him pain, or if it just his way of responding to the approaching seizure?\u00a0\u00a0In Idiopathic Epilepsy the vocalizations prior to the seizure are said to be involuntary and not painful.http://www.canine-epilepsy-guardian-angels.com/CanineEpil.htmThe drinking afterward could possibly be diabetic related.\u00a0\u00a0He definitely should be checked for canine diabetes and hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0 Does he eat well during his meal times? Does his food contain sugar?\u00a0\u00a0How many times a day do you feed him?\u00a0\u00a0 Is he drinking and peeing a lot ?My mom had a dog with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Her diabetic dog would go nuts if her water bowel ever became empty.\u00a0\u00a0She would bark and jump at things that were not there, and ram her head into walls etc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even on short road trips to McDonald's and back she required ice cubes or water to be present or the symptoms would start again.I Hope This Helps!\u00a0\u00a0 Good Luck To You and Your Little Guy.\u00a0\u00a0God Bless Brenda",

            "answer": "Your chi is definitely having seizures.\u00a0\u00a0You'll need to have your vet examine him to determine WHY they're happening.\u00a0\u00a0If no cause is evident, then it's called \"idiopathic\" epilepsy, which only means they don't know why these misfires happen in the brain.\u00a0\u00a0Seizures can usually be well-controlled with medication like phenobarbitol, so make sure you talk to your vet about it.Our neighbor has a huge labrador retreiver who has had seizures most of his life.\u00a0\u00a0His meds have had to be increased a couple times, but they're controlled to one event about every two to three months now.You need to be aware of hazards like pools and ponds with an epileptic dog.\u00a0\u00a0If they seize in the water they'll likely drown.\u00a0\u00a0Try not to panic when it happens.\u00a0\u00a0Let the seizure run its course and keep your dog out of the way of things like furniture that may harm him.\u00a0\u00a0It's very common for dogs and humans to vomit, defecate and/or urinate in the course of a seizure.\u00a0\u00a0You'll want to make sure your dog doesn't breathe in stomach contents if he vomits.\u00a0\u00a0Recovery time is always necessary and at least an hour is usually needed.\u00a0\u00a0Some dogs may need the rest of the day to fully recovery.Keep a seizure diary and record the date, time of day, and anything else that might be going on that could act as a trigger.\u00a0\u00a0My vet had one dog who seized only when the doorbell rang.\u00a0\u00a0Disconnecting it solved the problem.\u00a0\u00a0Go figure, right?!\u00a0\u00a0Keeping a diary also helps your vet determine if and how much medication will be needed.",

    "question": "I have a 6mth old Chihuahua puppy that's has been having episodes where he starts yelping and then goes stiff then limp and for a split second stops breathing. Afterwards he seems as if he is extremely week and lays there, when he tries tolift his head he is really shaky. After bout a min or so he is fine and just wants alot of water. I have heard of Chihuahua's have hypoglycemia and seizures. But when i have looked up the symptoms of them both these do not match. Can anyone help me with maybe more info about it??",
