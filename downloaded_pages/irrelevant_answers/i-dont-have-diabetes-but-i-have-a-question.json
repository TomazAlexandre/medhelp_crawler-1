    "question": "i don't have diabetes but i know someone who does and i ended up getting a HUGE whiff of insulin and now i feel sort of sleepy and my energy is depleted, i woke up feeling fine, it's been about 45 mins i made sure to drink an energy protein drink with 20g+ of sugar. my question is, is the smell of insulin enough to provide a slight dose? what if it was in a cup and i accidently drank out of it? thank you for your time.",
