            "answer": "Not everyone who is overweight gets Type 2 diabetes. You do have more of a risk factor if it is in your family. It sounds like you know the main symptoms of diabetes and are not experiencing them. In my opinion you are doing the exact right thing to prevent yourself from developing diabetes in the future and to prevent other obesity caused health problems as well. Keep up the good work!",

    "question": "I have been over weight for probably all my life, I have been dieting recently and lost about 10 pounds in two weeks, I am trying my hardest to lose weight, cutting the junk food, eating smaller meals, exorcising but I have never really been to a doctor in maybe four to five years, I have never really been tested for diabetes, my dad has diabetes he is 59 years old.I do not get any headaches, I am not thirsty or hungry a lot, I can drink one bottle of coke or water in the morning and wont be thirsty again till maybe late at night. If I get a cut or wound it heals its self pretty fast. I also have three siblings none of them have diabetes, though out of the four of us I am the only one who is overweight.I do not have money at the moment to get a full exam from a doctor but I am starting a healthy life style as of two weeks ago, should I still have to worry about diabetes at the moment?",
