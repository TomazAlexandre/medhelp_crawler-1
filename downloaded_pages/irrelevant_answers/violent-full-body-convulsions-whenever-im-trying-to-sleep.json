            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!It is possible to feel tremors/convulsions all over the body. Tremors are often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Take care!",

            "answer": "Can I ask you a question? When you feel the convulsions coming, does it feel like your body has sort of tensed up? Like when you get a chill and your body gets tense just before you shiver? I'm curious because this happens to me quite often, but I always manage to keep from the actual \"shiver\" part. I feel like I'm just going to shake all over (so maybe a convulsion or seizure type thing). It's scary because it often happens when I'm not home (unlike you) but I wonder if it is a similar problem.",

    "question": "The past couple of weeks I\u2019ve been involuntarily convulsing whenever I\u2019m a bit too tired (I have FM, I am always tired). It\u2019s not tremors, it\u2019s full out convulsions where my arms and legs and head and everything jerk. It\u2019s worse when I lie down then when I don\u2019t. I have no control over it. I can feel the convulsion coming and I can stave it off a little bit but the pain builds and builds in my body until it \u201cexplodes\u201d and I jerk violently. If I try and stave it off it makes it worse and repeats itself more than if I let the convulsion happen in the first place. If I let the convulsion happen then I sometimes only get a couple smaller convulsions. It doesn\u2019t stop until I\u2019m asleep and doesn\u2019t happen when I wake up; it progressively gets worse during the day. The only things I can find online for convulsions are seizures, but I\u2019m totally conscious for everything and I don\u2019t think it is epilepsy. I don\u2019t know why this is happening, the only thing that\u2019s changed in the past couple of weeks is that I had an ectopic pregnancy and got an injection of MTX, but I don\u2019t think that is responsible (I don\u2019t really know, though). I can\u2019t get to a doctor to ask about this (I live far away from a hospital) and I\u2019m really worried. Can anyone give me any idea of what it is and if I should try and find a way to get to a doctor?",
