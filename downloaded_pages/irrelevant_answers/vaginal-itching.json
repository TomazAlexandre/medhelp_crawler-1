It's really quite helpful - thanks !You need to go back to your gyn for further evaluation. Sometimes it's a viscious circle of yeast, treat it and then get bv and treat it and then get yeast and so on and so on. it can be very annoying for us gals :(I'm a fan of femdophilus by jarrow myself. google it. you can even send for a free sample on their website. It's a probiotic that helps replace the 'good' bacteria in our urogenital tracts so that we can prevent vaginitis and stop the circle of treatment that sometimes occurs.grace",

    "question": "Ok. This is my third post about this. For over a month, I've had intense vaginal itching, so much to the point of chafing. I went to the doc, and she said I had a bacterial infection, and gave me antibiotics. Mind you, I AM on birth control, and had been previously taking antibiotics for an ear infection. So, I was thinking I had the YI from the antibiotics. But, the bacterial infection, I had a LOT of discharge and there was an odor. The second time I went, I had a test, and she said I def had a yeast infection, and she was concerned because there were a lot of white blood cells. She put me on Diflucan, and I took both doses and STILL had the YI. I heard your body can be resistant to Diflucan, so I got OTC Monistat and...of course I still have the itching and some discharge. It's not as intense, but it's still annoying. I've been tested for diabetes, and my gyno asked me if I've been tested for HIV, which concerned me. I was tested for everything in the beginning of the year, and I'm pretty sure I wasn't exposed to HIV. I'm not sure if maybe I just need to let nature take its course and let the natural flora come back or what? I've also been taking AZO Yeast pills..nothing helps.",
