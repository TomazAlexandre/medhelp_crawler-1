            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to infected hair follicles or boils. Keep the area clean and apply some warm compresses and topical antiseptics. Also wear loose-fitting cotton clothing and use an antibacterial soap or mild soap like dove. Avoid any kind of cosmetics. Topical antibiotics such as mupirocin or neomycin containing ointment are also useful. In case the symptoms persist then oral antibiotics may be needed. Please consult a dermatologist in that case. Also get your blood sugar levels estimated since recurrent boils are found in diabetes.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I am seeking help/information on what i believe is re-occuring folliculitis in the vaginal area (outside). I am not 20 years old. From i was 14 and started shaving, every now and then i would get a hard lump under the skin. After a few days, a softer,tender red lump would appear on the surface,only painful if pressed. A few days after that, it appears to rupture and red/pinkish fluid secretes from it. After a few days, it drys up and disappears, but the area is left dark,with not much hair growth. This has occured in different areas. I dont treat it as it usually goes away, except for one time it was really bad and i got an anti-fungal cream. I decided to stop shaving, but apparantly the same thing occurs. I now just trim with scissors.The area still remains dark. Any help/advice/diagnosis? Anyone has similar experiences?",
