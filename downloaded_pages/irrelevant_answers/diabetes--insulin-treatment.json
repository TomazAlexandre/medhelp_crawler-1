All you need to increase about 5 units both times and try to reduce your weight and increase your physical activities. As your fasting and random sugar levels are immediate indicator of treatment so you can follow them routinely but ultimate goal would be to bring glycated Hb to 6.5-7.00. I hope I answered your question.",

            "answer": "There are no doctors on this forum. You should always consult with your physician on medication dosages not a stranger on a public health forum.You need to reduce your A1c levels as close to normal as possible where normal is <5% [99 mg/dl or 5.5 mmol/l] and where your 7.9% A1c is equivalent to a daily average glucose of 180 mg/dl [10 mmol/l]. You can lower you glucose by following a diabetic nutrition plan restricting not only sugary foods but carbohydrates and foods made with white flour, maintain proper body weight, and 30 minutes of physical exercise daily. After 31 years as a diabetic all of the aforementioned should be part of your daily life. If it hasn't, they should be. Good luck.",
