            "answer": "Doctors normally do not reply in here . If your looking for a doctor's response I would try a different forum :) but my opinion your period is late enough that it would show up on a test being 19 days late , if the test was wrong and you are a blood test will give you a answer . Go to your doctor and ask for blood work pregnancy test or a free clinic and they will maybe do an ultrasound depending were you live . Also try not to stress you can convince your body of things and stress can cause a late period as well . Goodluck . Did You have unprotected sex ? If yes there's always a chance",
