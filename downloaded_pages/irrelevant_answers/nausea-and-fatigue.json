            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Commonest cause of chronic nausea is acidity. Take omeprazole (empty stomach in morning) and antacid gel and see if it helps. Liver and kidney dysfunction is another cause. Hence kidney and liver function tests should be done. Other causes are diabetes and hypothyroidism. Electrolyte imbalance too can cause nausea. IBS, gluten or lactose intolerance, parasites in gut too can be the cause. A stool test should be done for worms, giardiasis etc. Also if nothing is found then food challenge test to detect food intolerance should be done.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Take care!",

Do you have any problems with depression or anxiety?",

    "question": "I've had feelings of nausea and fatigue for the past month and a half (no I'm not pregnant) and my blood results came back all normal. I'm more nauseous in the mornings, but it's a constant feeling throughout the day unless I take anti-nausea medication to help (and even that doesn't always help). The only thing the dr. said about my blood results was that my TSH was slightly high but he was pretty confident it wasn't hypothyroidism because my thryoid tested normal.Anyone have similar symptoms and can help? I'm getting extremely frustrated and afraid to leave my apt each day in fear that I will start feeling sick:(",
