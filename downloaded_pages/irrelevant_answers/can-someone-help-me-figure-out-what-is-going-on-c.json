            "answer": "Hi, unintentional weight loss can occur with hyperthyroidism, diabetes, certain medications, depression, eating disorders, and infections and due to loss of appetite. If these conditions can be ruled out, your symptoms could be due to depression. You will need to consult your primary care physician for re assessment and he may then refer you to a psychiatrist if needed. Take care. Regards.",

    "question": "Sorry if i'm posting this in the wrong section, but I hope someone can help me figure out what is going on. I have lost weigh and I can feel my bones. My body feel weak and I can barely hold anything. It hard for me to walk too. My chest, neck, and throat hurts like it is strain or someone is pulling on it. When i move my neck to the side it really hurts. My period blood seems to be coming out brown lately. I have to admit I was having anxiety over something and barely eating, but I am over the issue, but I thought it would go away, But my body has been aching lately and I don't know what's going on. It feels like my leg is about to rip off any moment.",
