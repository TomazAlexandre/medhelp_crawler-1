    "question": "Does anybody know what the basic calorie and nutritional needs of the baby are in the second trimester? I gained weight pretty fast in the first trimester and early part of the second trimester. Now I've been told because of my family history of diabetes I should be careful about gaining more...which seems impossible, because I'm worried about the baby getting too little of all the nutrition it needs if I'm too restrictive with diet, and I'm trying to be as active as I can but I don't want to overdo it and hurt the baby.I never went totally crazy with my diet, I did eat more carbs because of nausea and I stopped a lot of my exercise because I just wasn't feeling well, so I think it's as much a metabolism issue as anything. Pre-pregnancy, I had the type of metabolism that if I did an hour of cardio and weights 5-6 days a week and ate healthier than your average person, all I did was maintain. If I stopped exercising for even a week and had no dietary changes, I could easily gain 5 lbs. Any advice would be appreciated, struggling with this one.",
