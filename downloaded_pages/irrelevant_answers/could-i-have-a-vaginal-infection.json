            "answer": "I concur with the above.\u00a0\u00a0What you smell in your urine can be from something you've eaten but it also could be a sign of a metabolic condition. Lots of of conditions, like diabetes, give urine a particular odor.\u00a0\u00a0It is not due to any drugs you may have taken in the past.\u00a0\u00a0Your really need to get tested.\u00a0\u00a0Having cloudy, odorous urine is a serious condition that almost certainly needs treatment. Good luck.",

            "answer": "Thank you guys for your responses. Oh, and one more thing I forgot to mention, I've also been having mild to severe abdominal pains, mostly on my right side. Not sure if this is even relevant, but just thought I should put that information out there. I don't normally drink any energy drinks, but I have one every once in a while. I'm also on medication, for depression, anxiety, and ADHD. Could that affect my urine? Thanks again for your helpful responses.",

    "question": "This has been going on for about a year now, I've noticed. When I go to the bathroom, my urine is usually sort of clouded, and has an odd smell attached with it. The smell isn't sulphuric or \"yeasty\", or anything else I've seen described on this site. Mine sometimes smells like what I can only describe as a nutmeg-sort of odor. Other times it actually smells like cherries, but I don't even eat cherries. The smell can be strong enough that I notice it in class, and sometimes I only smell it while I urinate. It has become a problem for me now, as it's much more frequent lately. The other day, even my boyfriend was complaining about the smell, which made me extremely selfconcious. I told him that I didn't want to have sex for a while, at least until we figure out what's wrong.Mind you, I did not come here to be judged, so please don't give me dumb comments on what I\"ve done wrong. I feel like I should tell you some of my past in case it helps. I'm 15 years old, I USED to smoke weed, and I once tried LSD. I just want to know if this could be an effect of the drugs. Please, I'm quite desperate for help now, and answers are greatly appreciated. Thank you. xoxo",
