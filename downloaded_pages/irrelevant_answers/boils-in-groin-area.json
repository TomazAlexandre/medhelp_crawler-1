            "answer": "Hello,I used to get quite a few boils as well when I shaved, so I can see why they suggested the waxing.\u00a0\u00a0These are most likely ingrown hairs, which can grow quite big and be painful!\u00a0\u00a0I know, I've had to have one lanced by a doctor before, twice in fact.\u00a0\u00a0There's a lot of sweat, heat, and moisture down there that can contribute to the growth of ingrown hairs, along with shaving.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure about the medication so I cannot comment on that.\u00a0\u00a0Prevention would be another form of hair removal if possible, other than shaving.\u00a0\u00a0You may need to have this one that is the size of a quarter lanced if it's painful and bothersome.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you :)",

            "answer": "You should learn to accept the hair.\u00a0\u00a0It's there for protecting the skin.\u00a0\u00a0The skin needs to breathe.\u00a0\u00a0There is more to it than that.\u00a0\u00a0Something that can make a happy medium is to just trim the hair with scissors instead of trying to shave it off.\u00a0\u00a0That way you're not disturbing the roots and will be less prone to getting these boils.\u00a0\u00a0I know you're likely concerned about hygiene.\u00a0\u00a0Well, this will take care of that hygiene need.\u00a0\u00a0I find that not having enough hair is just as bad as having too much hair as far as those odors we're all self-conscious about.\u00a0\u00a0Also, not having the hair actually causes the skin to be irritated.\u00a0\u00a0So, it's actually better to just trim the hair or leave it alone.\u00a0\u00a0We were designed to have this hair for a reason, and since the person next to you out in public doesn't know if you leave your hair down there or not, it really shouldn't matter.\u00a0\u00a0And, your significant other should accept your decision to leave the hair alone if your significant other really loves you.",

            "answer": "Very common with type2 diabetics, caused by sugar being high, once controlled boils will subside, to treat them you can go to the er and have them drained (i found it very painful this way) or treat at home with a hot bath or a hot compress a few times a day until it pops on its own and drains, there are alot of sites that offer home remedies, ive gotten my sugar under control and havent had any in months, they are\u00a0\u00a0painful especially in the inner thigh and groin area, but can be treated and are common so dont feel weird ladies, hope this helps take care",

            "answer": "My daughter turned 15 and was immediately met with acne on her face and back that progressively got worse. We started treating it with homeopathic remedies. That seemed to keep it in check but didn't heal it. The acne was severe and we learned it had a name - cystic acne. The medical options had adverse side affects - so just continued the cleaning and supplement regimen to keep it under control. Two years later she was 17, she had her first boil in her groin area. We had no idea what it was - actually thought it was an ingrown hair and so we treated it as such. Then she began to get one after another. I googled, I questioned friends and family. We adjusted her supplements, thinking perhaps it was tied to the cystic acne - adding coconut oil, Spirulina and Chlorella as well as probiotics. Sometimes she would get through a couple of weeks without any boils - then to have them back to back.\u00a0\u00a0She was so embarrassed and overwhelmed. Then came the rashes. Rashes like what infants get with diaper rashes - on her privates and her female areas. She was miserable. Boils & Rashes! Rashes and Boils!Our family is on a budget and cannot afford huge medical bills. In February of 2017, I cried out to God for answers. That very night - He graciously helped me find the right combination of words in google.\u00a0\u00a0I'd been trying different combinations of words for the last 2 years! I saw a correlation between her cycle and the frequency of the boils - so I googled \"boils and rashes that pop up in groin area during a woman's menstrual cycle\" - I found the name - Hidradenitis Suppurativa.\u00a0\u00a0Coincidence or not (NOT!) - I had an answer. As I read article after article and blog after blog, I shook my head. As I looked at the photos - I had an answer!\u00a0\u00a0My daughter had an answer!We began reading about treatments. What we kept seeing was that DIET played a huge part in the answer.\u00a0\u00a0That was 7 months ago that we began. I am happy to say that my darling daughter has gone 3 months without a single boil. And we discovered what triggered the rash. And we have seen the cystic acne on her face and back clear up!This is her protocol that works for her. We have read many who write that everyone's journey and recovery is their own and unique.\u00a0\u00a0That is the truth!\u00a0\u00a0Keep searching, (keep praying), keep experimenting until you too are free from boils, rashes, acne and HS!\u00a0\u00a0My daughter now follows the AIP (Autoimmune Protocol - Paleo) diet. She did elimination diet slowly, from February to June. I will list in order what she eliminated. ALL of these foods triggered either boils or rashes!No gluten, no corn, no grains (except brown rice she can eat), no almonds, cashews, pistachios, no dairy, no legumes, no nightshades at all (no white potatoes, no tomatoes, no peppers, no eggplants, no paprika, no cumin, no cayenne, no chili powder).\u00a0\u00a0AND for her the most important one to avoid - ALL sugars!\u00a0\u00a0For sweeteners she can do pure raw honey, pure maple syrup and stevia in moderation - but that is ALL.\u00a0\u00a0If she has something that has a hidden sugar she will get a rash.As she got the boils at the beginning - we treated by washing the area, doing apple cider and Epsom salt baths and keeping colloidal silver and tea tree oil on the wound. That helped them from becoming infected.And one more thing - she always had sensitive skin. She has always been allergic to avocado oil lotions and perfumed lotions. We also knew she was allergic to latex - we found out when she was little with Band-Aid reactions.\u00a0\u00a0But we discovered this summer that she is allergic to feminine hygiene products which was triggering rashes during her cycle. She purchased Thinx period panties - and she used them for her cycle and that was the first time she did not get a rash during her period.For such a long time she was so devastated by an unknown illness. Then shocked to find out what it was but scared when she read that she would suffer from it forever! But we kept praying and searching and now she is on a journey to healing!",
