            "answer": "Hey Tex:Just get a copy of your blood work from your doctor. What was the actual results of your biopsy? If the doc said no damage that is great news. When I get my blood test results back I just look for anything that is flagged with a comment. Usually they only do that when it is out of normal ranges. The Pegasis that I am taking carries of risk of diabetes so you already being a type 2 might make it more of a challenge. Ask you doctor. When I started out last year and found this site I would just read along and little by little they have educated me. A few of these guys are briliant and I bring up the other end of the food chain. Best of luck to you. Dale",

            "answer": "Just so you know non alcoholic beer has a content by volume of .05%. It says it on the label. Your numbers are great on the biopsy if that is fibrosis not cirrosis. Jim, Flguy and a few others really no the numbers and exactly what they mean. They'll shoot you a line by tonight. I'd probably wait a couple of years before fooling with it again. You might be surprised. I'm gonna get fused at by my buddies in here for saying that too. Won't be the first time and I seem to have a steady diet of eating crow. Take care of yourself and work on the diabetes. DalePS: A type 1A is the most common type. Not sure you are an A or not.",

Although this seems to not be the case with you. I've had suspiciously low ldl for many years and I suspect HCV had a part in it.\u00a0\u00a0If I ever clear this junk I'll find out.Before tx I was dx'd with diabetes and began to take insulin, although lower doses, on a daily basis.\u00a0\u00a0During tx, and discovered at follow-up endo appt at about week 12 when I got to undetectable the diabetes and the need for insulin stopped.\u00a0\u00a0Abnormal blood sugar levels are known to associated with hcv, in some people.So, having hcv could possibly be a package deal with other stuff.But, my wife didn't buy my 'stinky feet due to hcv' defense for a minute.\u00a0\u00a0She and the family are getting used to calling \"BS\" on me when I play the 'HCV Card\".\u00a0\u00a0Hey' it's worth a try, if your going to have a chronic disease you may as well try to get some mileage out of it.Good luck",

Diabetes type 2, high cholesterol now taking meds for plus HCV.I have had all kinds of blood work done plus a liver biopsy which he said looked like no damage has been done.
