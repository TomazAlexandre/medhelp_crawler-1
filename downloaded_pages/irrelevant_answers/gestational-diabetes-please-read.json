            "answer": "If not controlled, the baby can be born with low blood sugar levels, which can be fixed and regulated with an iv. Not the biggest issue on hand. With GD, you run the risk of the child developing diabetes later on in life, as well as raising your chances of having type 2 diabetes after having the baby. The high blood sugar levels can cause the baby to weigh more than 9lbs. And not to scare anyone, but the biggest concern with GD, is a stillbirth. Not super common though, and most doctors will induce you before your due date to steer very clear of those chances. If they don't induce, they will do a lot of monitoring of you and the baby both to ensure that both of you are as healthy as possible. If it isn't controlled well enough with a strict diet, you will have to go on medication. Whether it's insulin or something else. I wouldn't worry too much though. You will end up seeing an endocrinologist and they will help you control your levels as much as possible, and your OB doctor should help you as well. My doctor is inducing me between 37-38 weeks because I have to use insulin to control my blood sugar levels. I started weekly appointments between 33-34 weeks, and they do Non-Stress Tests, to make sure the baby isn't having any stress put on her. So having been experiencing this since October, I would say to try not to worry too much. Easier said than done, when it comes to the health of your baby, but trust me when I say that both of your doctors will do everything to keep both of you healthy!!",

            "answer": "I have gestational diabetes, mine is medication controlled (metformin to be precise). My problem wasn't what I ate but the fasting numbers before I ate anything in the morning, I was told those numbers are my hormones and can't really be controlled. But other than that baby is all good, he is perfect weight at 36 weeks he's 6 lbs 10 oz and im definitely going to be induced if baby doesn't come before or on his due date just to be on the safe side. So just stay positive and think about the health of your unborn baby it makes the process easier and definitely worth it.",
