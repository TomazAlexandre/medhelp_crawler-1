            "answer": "Dear Joy2all,I am so sorry you are having such pain. Unfortunately, I am a volunteer and not a physician. My main experience is with type 1 diabetes, however, many possible complications can be the same in both. I would highly recommend that you speak to your physician as he/she would know the proper course of treatment.\u00a0\u00a0I have no idea if this is related to your diabetes, but I experienced, due to low potassium levels that caused \"charlie horses\" in my calves. It is a question that you might discuss with your doctor.I have also asked our other volunteers to watch for your question and you will probably see other comments. I wish you much luck and please let us know how you are doing. Thank you for reaching out to JDRF.Best Wishes,dm",

            "answer": "If your blood sugar control can be improved, that would be my first recommendation.\u00a0\u00a0So many things that plague us are improved dramatically when our system is in better balance.You might want to talk with your doc about checking your blood levels of minerals -- and not just blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Some folks (athletes) get relief from muscle cramps by increasing potassium and others have improvement with small amounts of quinine.I'm also not a doctor, so do talk about these possibilities with him/her since these things might not \"mix well\" with your current conditions or meds.Let us know what you find out.\u00a0\u00a0Leg cramping seems not uncommon among diabetics.",
