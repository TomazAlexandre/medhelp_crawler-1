            "answer": "#1 I didn't take the avonex. I checked it out on Mayo Clinic drug website, and it's contr-indicated in most of my conditions, and other drugs I'm taking. I don't understand why a Specialist would give it to me in the first place. #2, I took it for 23 days, only 4 shy of what he wanted me to, and it did absolutly no good. I also now have tongue fissures from it, and my mouth and lips are burned from it.One of the listed side effects.\u00a0\u00a0Never again will I take something without researching it first. It can also cause tendons to tear...I already have a partial Achilles tendon tear I've been trying to baby, diabetes, contr-indicated. And on and on. Also can cause muscle soreness..I have fibro, and all the other muscle stuff going on already. I'm considering stopping the Lyrica also, as it doesn't seem to be doing much good. But at least (so far) it's not hurting me like this drug was! Thank you for being concerned and asking. I'm getting closer to my appt with Dr. M on April 1 (Quix's dr), and am really hoping for some guidance and ANSWERS!!! Best wishes, hope you are feeling well too. Maggie",

    "question": "I had VERY weird hallucinations last night. I woke up out of a dead sleep, thinking my cat, who was stuck to my headboard (don't ask me how), was falling on me...I (thought) I tipped it back up, reached for the bedside lamp, which kept moving out of my reach, silly light, I finally got it on, cat was sleeping just fine on pillow, headboard was where it belonged. Everytime I closed my eyes I saw different cartoons and movies. Yes, I'm totally serious. My wallpaper, which I don't have, kept shifting into squares. I swear, I wasn't taking LSD! I think this is from the Avelox antibiotic the ENT Specialist gave me for the acute sinusitis. I keep telling his nurses, but nobody seems alarmed (nobody but me that is). I have 9 more days of this perscription. It's not doing anything for the sinusitis. Should I just quit it and not tell the dr? I almost called the ER, but didn't figure they could do anything for me. Since you are experiencing the problems with the Lyrica and tapering off, thought maybe you could give me your opinion. My gut instinct says stop taking it and don't ask don't tell..so to speak. What do you think.....Your very tired friend. Going to eat something, and go back to bed. Needless to say I don't feel rested!.........Maggie",
