            "answer": "Hi,The diagnosis of TIA is most often made by history, since the neurologic deficits are\u00a0\u00a0mostly\u00a0\u00a0resolved before the patient presents for treatment .The history will identify the causes of stroke eg . high blood pressure , high cholesterol ,diabetes , family history or smoking . A CT scan can detect bleeding in the brain but not a TIA . Strokes do not appear right away on a CT scan. Intracranial pressure is measured by a spinal tap ( lumbar puncture ) .After observing symptoms of increased intracranial pressure , spinal tap and CT scan are done . While spinal tap measures the pressure , the cause can be detected from a CT scan . Hope this helps you . Take care and regards !",

It explained a few things for me.If you get the time , could you please look at an earlier post of mine titled\" TIA or intracranial pressure\". I think I may be in trouble and need to get as much information as I can before Friday. I do understand that it is very complicated but I would very much appreciate your input. Yours gratefully, Cath278",
