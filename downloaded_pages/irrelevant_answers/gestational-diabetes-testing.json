            "answer": "No usually they do that at 20 weeks along. I have never had it before either but I know that with watching your diet all should be fine. I think they will give you a tester to to check your sugar at home. Take care and let us know how you are doing!!",

            "answer": "I just researched this the other day and I think that you should get it if you have had it before and are having signs but from what I read it is not accurate as it should be.Supposedly if you do a finger ***** test right after eating then and hour later it is more accurate. So you are checking it as your body metabolizes real food and not straight sugar. THere are lots of false highs with the glucose test. Midwifes and other countries do the finger stick and it costs less and they get better readings. I will be doing this as I have a tester from ahving low blood sugar in the psat from meds i was on for a couple months (birth control!)I also know that if you do the finger test it should not be over 128 first thing in the morning. There are also not many things they can give you if you have it but diet and exercise unless it is real bad then the benifits outweigh the risks.",

I'm 21, this is my first child, I'm healthy and was very very active until I had problems in my first trimester. Now I still haven't gotten an all clear for working out from my OB. I am kinda heavy, not obese or anything, but I'm not a size 2 lol. What tests might I be getting? I have read all the baby books, but they all talk about people over 35..do they do testing for people under 35?",

            "answer": "they do tests for everyone now for liability reasons. They have not said anything to me about the testing either, thank god cuz they will not be happy when I don't get the sugar test as they were not happy I did nto get the AFP test either.\u00a0\u00a0They do them around 24 weeks I think and will scedule it at that appointment. They are differnet now with ob visits! They have not measured me for over a month! They never even listen to the heartbeat last visit! I have heard this about alot of dr lately! But i feel him move all the time so I know he is alive and well:) I will be talking to my high risk dr about it Monday though.Around 18-20 weeks they test for AFP, aids, and something else, then the sugar at 24 weeks. They shoudl check urine for sugar and protien, measure you, and check hearttones every visit. Well that is what they used to do.",

They usually do the doppler, but even so I feel him/her kicking all the time too so I'm not worried about that. I haven't gotten measured once either. I think doctors these days are getting waaay to complacent! I want to sit down and ask my doctor all the questions I have, but she's in so much of a rush I can't and she doesn't encourage me to ask questions either. She was in such a rush last time that I nearly hyperventilated when she checked my lungs..you know \"deep breath, deep breath, deep breath..\" Lol funny but not lol",

But I don't have maternity insurance so I have to go through the state and I have literally a handful of doctors to choose from. I cannot wait for my next baby and being able to choose whatever doctor or midwife suits me best. Stupid insurance companies. Lol all the OB's in IL are leaving and moving into IN to practice because malpractice insurance is so high in IL. So whoever is left here either has to have reeeally good insurance or get stuff on the bottom of the barrel. Poo. I'm afraid that my OB is gonna miss something important because she's in too much of a rush.",
