            "answer": "Dear lilred,I agree with LRS and all of the other comments that have been posted. As far as the tingling after waking up it is probably like LRS said from sleeping in the wrong position. I have never heard of nerve damage pre-diagnosed type 1. This normally takes many years of poor control in most cases.I am very glad that you have a doctors appt, as we are all volunteers here and not physicians. If you suddenly develope symptoms that you haven't mentioned here (pain in your stomach, severe headaches, or extreme fatique) call your doctor right away and if you cannot get in, don't be afraid to have your local ER check you out. Please let us know what you find out. If you have type 1 diabetes we can help with resources and information. We also have wonderful volunteers (as you have seen)that will help in anyway.Sincerely,dm",

            "answer": "Welcome back,I'm so glad you have appt with your doc.\u00a0\u00a0Let us know what you find out, okay?Your hand/foot pain could be from sleeping in a way that pinched a nerve or perhaps your body is out of alignment from general stress and carrying books around, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Complications of diabetes -- often seen after quite soem years with the disease -- include neuropathy and vascular problems that can cause hand/foot pain.If you do have diabetes, your whole body is stressing now and things may hurt because of that.\u00a0\u00a0While it will take some time for your body to re-adjust to more normal blood sugar levels, many of the \"pre-diagnosis\" aches & pains & tiredness & grumpiness will begin to subside too.Take good care of you and thanks for staying in touch!",
