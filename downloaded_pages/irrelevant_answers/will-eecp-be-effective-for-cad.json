            "answer": "I have currently moved my practice to the Cleveland Clinichttp://my.clevelandclinic.org/heart/disorders/cad/eecp.aspxWe have found EECP to be a reasonable option for individuals whose anatomy precludes coronary bypass grafting as an option. However, EECP does not achieve identical results compared to bypass grafting. I would encourage you to seek second opinion to determine if you are a candidate for bypass or coronary intervention. Cost aside, effective therapy may be life saving.Best of Health",

    "question": "I have 90% Right Coronary Artery Blockage, 50% Left Heart Artery Blockage. Left groin pain with 100% PAD/PVD and with healthy Collateral Arteries. Latest Cardiologist advised me that Grafting surgery is very problematic and overly expensive . EECP was required with Life style changes. Please advise what's best as B(negative) blood group being very rare along with diabetes could be very hazardous and I was also told me\u00a0\u00a0that EECP would reverse PAD blocks as well/or form collateral arteries. Help sought. [Scans in Profile Photos]Except for the first no cardiologist has suggested surgery/Stents or bypass surgery.Note: Been smoking 2 packs and more since 1970 and am running my 60th year. Blood Group[B Negative]. No Angina pain/No heart Attack/No Heart Failure as yet.ECHO E.F: 60%Note: Have undergone 5 EECP sessions with remarkable results removing totally terrible dizziness as well back pain with degenerating spine in the middle.In view of Peripheral Vascular disease [With healthy collaterals ]in left groin would EECP be effective for Coronary Artery Disease? Stents/Bypass ruled out by me[Now] and all cardiologists except the very first one.",
