            "answer": "Hi!If the arm pain was due to some neuropathy, then this does respond to prednisolone or steroids. If the neuropathy started post viral infection (flu, cough cold, fever etc), then in all probability this should subside and not recur. However, if the neuropathic pain is secondary to diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme\u2019s or lupus, then these conditions need to be treated.Arm pain can also be due to Scalene Myofascial Pain Syndrome, inflammation of veins or phlebitis, inflammation of lymph channels or lymphangitis, deep vein thrombosis or compartment syndrome. So a correct diagnosis will help in correct treatment and pain relief. Do discuss this with your doctor. The MRI may show up something. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "The medication is a steroid and helps get rid of inflamation. It will make you feel better so finish it as prescribed. I don't know about your arm as I don't have any more detailed information. Get the test done. I feel sure your doctor will be able to diagnose you soon.",

    "question": "I have had horrible pain in my right arm for two months today. I have gone through a round on physical therapy and have been on an anti inflammatory prescribed by the doctor for two months also. I had a negative EMG but my symptoms and pain have only gotten worse. My Orthopedic Doctor has just ordered an MRI and prescribed methylprednisolone in a 6 day back. I am actually feeling pretty good and not as sore. I'm wondering if once the medication has left my system if I will go back to the severe pain or if this has \"solved\" the undetectable issue of my arm pain? Anyone have any similar experiences??",
