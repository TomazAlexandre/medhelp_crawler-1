    "question": "I'm almost 39 weeks and I just had an ultrasound because I have gestational diabetes and my doctor is worried about the baby's head size. We found out his head is in the 98th percentile and he weighs 8.5 pounds. The doctor recommended a C section. What are your guys' opinions or experiences?? I'll talk more to my doctor tomorrow about it, but I'd like to do as much research as I can first. Please share!",
