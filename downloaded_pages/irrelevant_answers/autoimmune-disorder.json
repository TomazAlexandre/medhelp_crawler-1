            "answer": "Hi FeelingBlah82.Well it could be a bit of RA, but may I ask why the anti-HVC testing?Lab errors are just too common nowadays, as labs seem to be cutting costs and thus, compromising possibly peoples health in the process.You may try some natural anti-inflammatories that will work better than any medications after using them for a few weeks. (there action is much more gradual than drugs, yet more efficient and no side effects when taken as indicated)1. Glucosamine/Chondroitin?MSM combo2. Botswella Serrata extract.3. Bromelain. (not indicated if on any blood thinners)Also a low carb, alkaline diet will help.You can also look into an anti-arthritis diet (a bit similar to the above one)Let me know if you need more details.Cheers!Niko",

    "question": "When i was 2mths pregnant my thighs started to ache it happen on and off through my pregnancy.I asked my ob about it and they said it was probably from being pregnant.Now since ive had her my whole legs ache but they dont ache while im walking around.Sometimes i get my son to sit on them and it relieves the pain but it starts back when he moves.I also have been having a weird stinging itch all over my body that comes and goes.Also ive been experiencing some joint pain in my elbows,knees and sometimes one of my fingers on the right hand aches.I havent been fatigue really or loss of appetite if anything i eat more.The reason i was wondering if this could be an autoimmune disorder is because they ran an anti hcv test on my and it came back positive so i went to get further testing and another anti hcv test and all my blood work came up normal.Then when i gave birth to my daughter they ran another anti hcv just to be sure and it came back negative.I ask the dr what could have cause the first false positive and he said either lab error or another protein.I know diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis runs in my family.",
