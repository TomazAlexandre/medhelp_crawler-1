            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Either the hormone replacement is not in the correct proportion or you have some other problem. Hence please get FSH, LH, estrogen and progesterone re-evaluated. Endocrine gland related conditions like hyperthyroidism, acromegaly and glucose control disorders (diabetes and hypoglycemia both) all result in increased sweating. Pheochromocytoma, cancers, carcinoid syndromes, tuberculosis and other infections too can cause increased sweating. It can also be due to low blood pressure. Get your thyroid and adrenal gland function tested.Do not be over anxious about this as this will increase sweating. Easier said than done, but you have to try meditation and yoga to calm your self. Avoid too much of tea, coffee, smoking and spicy food.\u00a0\u00a0Take up yoga, deep breathing exercise, and walking. Music and aerobics are also good stress busters. Drink plenty of fluids and water (not caffeine), eat fresh fruits and vegetables and keep yourself busy throughout the dayPlease consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
