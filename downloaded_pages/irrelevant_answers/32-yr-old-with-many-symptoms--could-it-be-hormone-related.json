            "answer": "One quick point - your physician is right.\u00a0\u00a0A fasting glucose level of greater than 126 is diagnostic of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You can repeat this test for confirmation.As for your symptoms, there is no clear cut answer.\u00a0\u00a0For the flushing, perimenopause is certainly a possibility, but less likely given your age and normal periods.\u00a0\u00a0For confirmation, you can obtain a FSH level which can suggest menopause.Regarding the facial hair and acne, you may want to be tested for polycystic ovarian syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0This is associated with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0To diagnose this, you may want to consider a pelvic ultrasound to evaluate the ovaries as well as tests to measure the free testosterone.\u00a0\u00a0An elevation in this level is suggestive of this disease.You may want to consider an endocrinology consult.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Thanks,Kevin, M.D.",

    "question": "I am a 32 yr old women with a history of HLAB27 spondyloarthropothy ( which is very mild and almost non-exsistent), and a recent weight loss of 50-60 lbs (by diet). I do not take any medication, except for daily multivitamins.About 6 weeks ago I started feeling fatigued and had urninary symptoms. I had a UTI that was daignosed by frequent urination, burning, and elveated WBC in urine. But there was no culture sent out. I was treated with 2 rounds of antiboitics.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms continued.\u00a0\u00a0Went to a Urologist.\u00a0\u00a0He found micro hemoturia but no bacteria.\u00a0\u00a0Did an IVP- it was normal.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms have ceased. He says that it may have never been a true UTI. He says that women my age sometimes have this problem.\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile, I am experiencing a tight, warm feeling in my face. It comes and goes in severity but is almost always there.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor ran a CBC and Basic metabolic panel. All was normal except the glucose.\u00a0\u00a0 My fasting glucose was 158.\u00a0\u00a0So she ran a 3 hr glucose tolerance test. That test came back in normal range.\u00a0\u00a0She claims that she can diagnose diabetes based on the 1st elevated lab alone.\u00a0\u00a0I am also feeling itchy thigh skin and burning muscles in both thighs, anxiety upon awakening from sleep, facial hair grows back quick and more coarse , irritability/mood swings, spotting, acne, body warmth without fever and a general fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0Friends have said that it may be perimenopause.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor says it is not likely because I have not missed a full period for 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0The facial \"flushing\" feeling, muscle burning, and anxiety are most troublesome.\u00a0\u00a0My rheumotologist says that the thigh burning is not related to my autoimmune arthritis. And she is basically at a loss.\u00a0\u00a0I am confused and really want to know which direction I should continue searching for some answers and if anyone else knows what this might be related to. Thanks",
