            "answer": "I would suggest that you see your doctor so that he can take blood tests for anaemia and diabetes and any other test that he may feel you require to rule out other possibilities.\u00a0\u00a0You can experience blurry vision with diabetes as well as other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Take a urine sample with you when you go too.You may have an inner ear infection, but you do not complain of any ear or throat problems. May be you are coming down with some infection.\u00a0\u00a0 Feeling light headed can also stem from postural and spinal problems.Make sure that you eat a healthy and balanced diet with fresh fruit and veg and drink lots of water so you do not become dehydrated (this too can make you feel light headed).Feeling dizzy and light headed can also be due to that the fact that your sugar levels are either too high, or too low.\u00a0\u00a0Hypoglycaemia can happen even if you are not diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0This is when there the sugar level drops too low in your body, so it is important to eat regularly.Make sure that you are also having adequate rests and plenty of sleep.Let us know how you get on with the doctor.Best wishes.",
