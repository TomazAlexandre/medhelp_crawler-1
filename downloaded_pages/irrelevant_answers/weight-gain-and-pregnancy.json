I lost to start and then some.\u00a0\u00a0The weight was gone within a week of having baby.\u00a0\u00a0Just be careful and watch what you eat to an extent.\u00a0\u00a0Try to eat healthy when you can, but do indulge in some cravings once in awhile.\u00a0\u00a0My Dr. would let me know how I was doing, up too much, not enough...she was tough.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, 35 lbs. is within the recommended range.\u00a0\u00a0It feels like more when you get a big ol belly.\u00a0\u00a0Mine came around the 6th month.\u00a0\u00a0Go enjoy that baby in your belly!",

    "question": "I read that if a person is normal weight for their hight before pregnancy, they should gain around 25-35 pounds with a pregnancy. ok well im 23 weeks and at 20 pounds already. i dont want to gain all that much because it would be harder for me to loose, but is it really possible to gain only 15 pounds (more) with a pregnnacy (i would expect a LOT more)? would me only gaining 35 pounds be really all that good for the baby?",
