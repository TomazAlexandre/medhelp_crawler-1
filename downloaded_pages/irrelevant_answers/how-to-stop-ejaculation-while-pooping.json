            "answer": "Hi there!Abnormally timed ejaculation could be caused due to stress/ psychological issues, neurogenic disorders, peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/ medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. At a primary level I would suggest being a bit relaxed about the situation and controlling avoidable factors such as stress, smoking, alcohol etc. and see if this seems to improve the condition. If you do not notice any improvement, it might be a good idea to consult a urologist for a detailed evaluation and appropriate management.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "Hey! I'm a 14 year old guy and i'm damn worried about my problem that has been occuring from the past 6-7 months. Whenever i go to poop, streams of semen come down when i put pressure to poop. After that, I feel all tired and stuff just like you feel after ejaculating. I went to a doctor and that old whack said that I should just stop watching porn and stop ejaculating but I think thats not helping because even after all that, it just won't stop! I want a normal life with no ejaculation! Please tell me what to do! I feel helpless. How to stop all this as soon as possible?!Thanks!",
