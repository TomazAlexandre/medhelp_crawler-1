            "answer": "Are you diabetic? Cause if you are then yes! I have type 2 diabetes and it became very hard to control while I was pregnant. The numbers need to be way lower with pregnancy. 60-95 before eating breakfast (fasting numbers) and 2 hours after each meal it needs to be below 120. If it's consistently higher talk to your doctor ASAP so they can adjust your meds. The extra insulin that baby might be getting can cause their heart to thicken which causes them to grow at a faster rate (like steroids). It's bad because they get too big but their organs, lungs and other body systems won't grow as fast.",

I'm a type 2 diabetic so I had this before I got pregnant and they still didn't think it was necessary to be on insulin shots. If you aren't seeing a perinatologist maybe you should ask for a referral to see one. It's a specialist that deals with GD, diabetes and high risk pregnancies. I love my perinatologist and she is the one that dictates the meds and care that should be given and my regular OB says ok.",

But if normally your fasting numbers are high then thats why they put you on insulin. I have a coworker that went straight to insulin and shes a diabetic now but her numbers were crazy high like in the 500 when she did the glucose test. The doc just prob know that pills wont help you.
