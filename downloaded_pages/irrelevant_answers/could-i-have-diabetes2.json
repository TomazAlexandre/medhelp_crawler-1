            "answer": "Does your family have a history of diabetes? I ask since your father appeared to know a sugary drink would bring you about. This is something you should not take lightly. Call your doctor immediately and inform him/her what you experienced. Ask if they know your test results and if it reflects hypoglycemia [low glucose [blood sugar]], type 1 diabetes. If the answer is yes and/or maybe/unsure, you should ask also to have your thyroid and pancreas tested along with insulin production. If one or both misfires your glucose suffers.Finally, let me repeat myself, call your doctor immediately and inform him/her what you experienced.Good luck and hope this was a one time incident.",

            "answer": "A week for test results - wow? Is that the norm in the UK? I get mine in 12 hours but not more than 24 hrs [USA].In the meantime read up on hypoglycemia and how to treat type 1 diabetes. You may have inherited your grandmothers type 1 gene. How's your mother's side of the family? Any diabetics? Also, try to eat 5 or more small meals a day to keep you glucose levels balanced.",

            "answer": "First of all, if this happens again, the drill is to go immediately to an emergency room. Not set up an appointment with a physician three days from now.The assumption that your neurological episode was due to low blood sugar may or may not be true. There are similarities between hypoglycemic loss of consciousness and an epileptic seizure, but the differential diagnosis should be left up to an ER.If you had a simple fasting blood test the results should have been available immediately. If your sugar was abnormally low the tech was seriously negligent in not informing you of this fact.",
