Just continue adding to this post at this point. thank you.as I said in your other post, getting recurrences of shingles like this would be very unusual.the dose of acyclovir for suppressive therapy is 400mg 2x/day. when you have a recurrence, up it to either 400mg 3x/day for 5 days or 800mg 3x/day for 2 days. Both doses speed healing of lesions at the same rate and the 2 day dose is just more convenient for most folks.are you on immunosuppressents for your RA?grace",

    "question": "To: anyonei have had shingles for 5 years now. every year i break out more often. the first breakout i was extremely ill and i broke out three times in a two month period. first on my right hip the size of a quarter and i thought i was going to die from the pain. the second one foollowed quickly and it was from front to back between my legs, as it was healing, i broke out for the third time on my right hip again. since then it has progressed to up to six times a year. i also now have type 2 diabetes, i had rhuematoid arthritis for 15 years before that but i now have high blood pressure have just been diagnosed with tmj and i have diverticulosis that has already resulted in a burst colon three years ago. my dr. just took skin scrapings from the last breakout because now he is saying it might not be shingles. I have had genital herpes for 35 years. untreated. he thinks i might have a problem with my immune system. what tests should i be having? i have no insurance.\u00a0\u00a0 I have been taking 800 mg of aclyclovir 2x daily if no outbreak and 5 -400 mg tablets 4x daily during outbreaks. shelley544",
