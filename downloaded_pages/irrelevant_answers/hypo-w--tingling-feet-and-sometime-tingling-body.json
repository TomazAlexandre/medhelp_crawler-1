For example, if you have carpal tunnel syndrome or low back pain, certain exercises may be recommended.If you have diabetes, your doctor will discuss ways to control your blood sugars. Medications that cause numbness or tingling may need to be switched or adjusted. DO NOT make any changes to your medications without instructions from your doctor.

            "answer": "Thank you, that was very informative!!\u00a0\u00a0More background: I do NOT have diabetes, my B12 levels to high,everything else in blood work is NORMAL. Carpal tunnel was mentioned to me as possible cause of hand symptoms. The feet tingling is pretty much daily, the back/body tingling is only a couple of times a week and I only notice it when I'm in bed. The back, shoulder/body tingling is a bit worriseom to me as MD can't find another health issue, at least not from my blood tests. I hoping it is thyroid/hypo/hasi related and disappears when tsh is back in normal range. Currently my tsh is 5.3.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with hashimoto's hypothyroid a couple of months ago. I'm taking 75mcg of synthroid and my tsh has come down to 5.3, but I still have tingling feet and when I'm in bed I notice tingling in my body - mostly my back and sometimes one or both shoulders. I've been to an orthopedist who said that I do NOT have a back/disk problem! - Is the tingling in my body and feet a symptom of hypo/hashi?? I'm starting to worry!!!! (I also have constipation, and\u00a0\u00a0a bit absent-minded lately. I'm 40, female.) Anyone esle been through this?",
