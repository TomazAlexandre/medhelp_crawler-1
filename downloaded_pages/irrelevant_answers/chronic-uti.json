            "answer": "Hello,I know that suffering from recurrent UTI\u2019s is really very painful. In males, as you know UTI\u2019s are quite rare but unfortunately once the males get the UTI\u2019s, they become difficult to treat. Important things to be ruled out for recurrent UTI\u2019s in a male are :-1. Diabetes2. Any urinary obstruction commonly due to stones/strictures3. Any congenital abnormality in the urinary tract4. Chronic prostatitisHe should definitely see a urologist and will need further tests to rule out these possibilities. For e.g. an USG of the kidneys,ureters and bladder, IVU etc.I sincerely hope that helps. Please do keep me posted. Warm regards.",
