            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Her GFR levels are below the normal range and vitamins will not affect the GFR levels. If she is taking\u00a0\u00a0a normal diet, she need not supplement vitamins. According to the National Kidney Foundation, normal results range from 90 - 120 mL/min/1.73 m2. Older people will have lower normal GFR levels, because GFR decreases with age.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "My aunt had her health examined and her glomerular filtration rate is at 70ml/min. She thinks it has to do with consuming too many vitamin B12 (her B12 level is above normal) and I also think that she consumed way too many other types of vitamins. I told her to stop consuming any type of vitamins for two months and see if her kidney condition improves. But she really want to continue to take the Lipo-Flavonoid (which contains Vitamin B1, B2, B6,B12, C, niacin, pantothenic acid, and calcium) because she said that it helps with her tinnitus. She also wants to take the Bilberry vitamin with lutein for her eyes. What is the best thing for her to do? Thanks in advance.",
