            "answer": "Hello all. I am 52 years old and a female and a sunbaking freak. I have just had 3 red marks removed from my chest that I suspected were some sort of skin cancer. Turns out I have Grover's Disease. Just thought I'd let you all know this is NOT a disease that is restricted to males as all the internet info states! I tried all sorts of remedies first but getting them cut off provided me with no more itching which was bliss :)",

            "answer": "I have been diagnosed with Grover's disease and have been using Clobex spray. In the past it has helped reduce the itching and reduced the redness. It has flared up again and the spray seems to reduce the itching temporarily, but the redness is getting worse. I am a 67 year old male in good health.",

    "question": "My husband (77) has had Grover's disease since April 2001.\u00a0\u00a0It was finally diagnosed by biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0He has been on Prednisone (20 mg /day) for 5 years.\u00a0\u00a0Each time we try to reduce it, the Grover's comes roaring back.Dec. 21, 2002, he had his second heart bypass and has recovered well.\u00a0\u00a0He had carotid artery surgery in Dec. 2005...and is doing well after that.Our main problem is his body's reaction to Prednisone.\u00a0\u00a0It has created diabetes and is causing multiple other problems.\u00a0\u00a0However, he will face\u00a0\u00a0almost anything rather than \"the itch\" coming back.\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0\u00a0occasionally supplements the Prednisone with a topical steroid and Gold Bond powder.\u00a0\u00a0Is there any other treatment that is available that would be less invasive and with less damaging side effects.Thanks in advance for whatever assistance you can give us on this.",
