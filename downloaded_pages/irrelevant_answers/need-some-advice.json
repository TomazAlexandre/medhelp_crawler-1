    "question": "Hi everyone, thanks in advance.To keep this short, I was diagnosed in 2009 with Celiac disease by positive anti-tTg IGA and positive biopsy. My tTg at the time was 28 (range 0 - 10) and my biospy put me at Marsh IIIb (moderate villus atrophy). My blood test at 1 year had my tTG up to 40 which was a disappointment, so I restricted my diet down to mainly whole foods. The only processed foods I eat are gluten free cereals from my health food store. My most recent test showed that my tTG was now 190!!!! How can this be in one years time??? I also have been dealing with on and off mild anemia. My reticulocyte count has also been low consistently, so I may be going for a bone marrow biopsy. In the end my question is how can the tTg go up almost 5 times the original value in one year when I've restricted my diet over that time. Even if I accidentally got CC'd here and there, I don't see how it could change so fast. I am just worried about having elevated levels as I want my risk for other health issues to go back to normal. Also I am confused as to why my stomach issues have improved. Since going gluten free I no longer have any bowel issues. My bowel movements are normal, my gas is gone and all seems fine. My only issue is 20 lbs weight loss in the last 6 months and fatigue, but no stomach problems. Anyways, any advice is appreciated!!!Thanks everyone!!",
