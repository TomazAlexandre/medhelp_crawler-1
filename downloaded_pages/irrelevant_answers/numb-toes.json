            "answer": "HiNumbness in the toes can be due to a lot of causes like a diabetes, hypothyroidism, arthritis, disc herniation, arteriovenous malformation, effect of some medication, peripheral neuropathy, stroke, hemorrhage, tumor, cervical spine disorder, injury, lyme disease, etc. Disc herniations can cause neurological symptoms such as numbness, back pain, leg pain, tingling, weakness etc in the limbs. It is important to know the site of the disc herniations and the type of symptoms that you are experiencing.Do you have any history of injury, raised cholesterol, raised BP, diabetes, cervical spondylosis or any other medical problems? Since you are experiencing the symptoms for a long time, it may perhaps be due to some medical disorder.I would advise that you should consult a neurologist with your past medical and neurological examination and tests like CT scan, MRI or lumbar puncture, as appropriate, would be able to diagnose your condition. You should take rest and avoid lifting any weights for the next few days.Do write in if you need some other information.Take care!",
