What kind of sickness is it? Does it feel like burning\u00a0\u00a0and bile coming up? Could it be from stress??",

    "question": "OK well I am a 28 year old male and it all started back in Novemeber and it would come and go. I would get nauseous and then feel fine for a few weeks and then it would come back. I went to the doctors to see if they could figure out what was wrong with me and they perscribed me Omeprozole because they thought it was acid issues. I didnt think it was, because it doesnt feel anything like acid, but ever since I started that I get neuseous every day. I have had an endoscopy done, a ct scan, an ultrasound of my liver and galbladder, my thyroid checked, i have been checked for hpylori, they have checked my blood cells, they have did a gastric emptying test checked for gerd and all have came back normal.I dont know what to do, I just keep getting nauseous and no doctors can tell me why this is happening.",
