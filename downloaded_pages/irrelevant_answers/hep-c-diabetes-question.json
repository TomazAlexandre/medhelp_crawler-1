            "answer": "Fasting (no food for 8 hours before the test) is important, Rex. If you were indeed fasting, the result is slightly elevated.Typically, normal blood glucose should be <100 mg/dL. Pre-diabetes occurs with fasting numbers between 100 and 125 mg/dL, and diabetes above 125.Yes, blood glucose, like blood pressure changes from hour to hour, day to day. Just like blood pressure and hypertension, one or two elevated results doesn\u2019t necessarily imply a diabetic condition.Your doctor will likely keep a close watch on blood glucose, and if it continues to be elevated, might suggest management which could include diet and exercise, as well as the possibility of medicine.Maintaining a proper body mass index (BMI), adequate exercise and monitoring carbohydrates are all good ideas, whether diabetes is diagnosed or not.Good luck,--Bill",

            "answer": "The two sugar cubes might have been sufficient to increase blood glucose, depending when they were eaten.However, with a low BMI such as yours, it\u2019s less likely you are dealing with type II diabetes.Can you purchase a home blood glucose test meter if you\u2019re concerned? In the U.S. these can be purchased for about USD $50.00, the test strips roughly $.75 each. This would allow you to test blood glucose at your convenience. It\u2019s very possible your elevated result was transient; be sure to discuss this with your doctor,Bill",

            "answer": "Studies are finding even slightly elevated glucose levels (pre-diabetic) can have adverse effects on the body. The normal cutoff with most labs is 100 but ideally people should try and keep their glucose level below 85.The metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes is becoming an epidemic in most of the world. If people only knew how much damage elevated glucose does to the body, i.e. heart , vascular & kidney disease. Just to name a few.Don't be fooled this damage is happening with just slightly elevated\u00a0\u00a0glucose levels. Do whatever it takes to get below 85!Eat a low carb diet and exercise. If that don't lower your levels then ask your doctor about a drug like Metformin. It is a proven safe old drug and also cheap.",

However, almost all insulin resistance was in muscle, with little or none in the liver, a very surprising finding given that Hepatitis C is a liver disease.Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps the body use glucose for energy. The two most important organs that respond to insulin are the liver and muscle. A healthy liver responds to insulin by not producing glucose, while healthy muscle responds by using glucose. An insulin resistant liver produces unwanted glucose, while insulin resistant muscle cannot absorb it from the bloodstream, leading to high levels of sugar in the blood.\"Contrary to all expectations, not only did we find no significant insulin resistance in the liver of the patients in the study, half of them suffered from a strain of Hepatitis C that causes about three times the normal level of fat to accumulate in the liver,\" said study author Professor Don Chisholm.\"The fifteen people with very high levels of fat in the liver had the same degree of insulin resistance as the fourteen that didn't have fatty livers.\"\"A number of important investigators around the world have been arguing that fat in the liver is an extremely important determinant of insulin resistance, perhaps the most important. At least in this context, we've shown that not to be the case.\"\"Before you get Type 2 diabetes, you must become insulin resistant and your insulin producing cells must also fail to compensate. Insulin resistance alone will not give you diabetes.\"\"In our study, we gave intravenous glucose, a specific stimulus to insulin secretion, and showed that insulin secretion was not impaired in Hepatitis C patients compared to our control group.\"\"This finding tells us that people with Hepatitis C who develop diabetes probably have susceptible insulin-producing cells, and would probably get it anyway \u2013 but much later in life. The extra insulin resistance caused by Hepatitis C apparently brings on diabetes at 35 or 40, instead of 65 or 70.\"\"More work now needs to be done into why Hepatitis C causes insulin resistance in muscle. That will give us better insight into the behavior of the disease.\"\"At this stage, it is helpful for people with Hepatitis C to understand insulin resistance and what it can mean for them. If they have relatives with Type 2 diabetes, they will be genetically prone to developing it themselves and so would be advised to manage their diets very carefully and take plenty of exercise \u2013 to slow onset.\"",
