            "answer": "Hi! Are you from Houston? Well, I just wanted to tell you that my Mom just found out that she has hypothyroidism and she is also on medication for it. However; she found this doctor where she lives that still put her on a weight loss program that includes a low dose of phen and b12 shots, and a high protein low carb diet. She has struggled with her weight for YEARS. She always thought her thyroid was low, but the doctors would always test her and tell her she falls within normal range. Turns out she is severly low. She has since lost 22 pounds. I would suggest trying to find a bariatric doctor who deals with thyroid problems. Alot of them will file with your insurance. If you do not have insurance I know that there are alot of natural remedies and diets that should help you control your weight. I hope you find something that will work for you. If I can do anything to help you please let me know! Don't give up, and be thankful that they found the cancer. God Bless!",
