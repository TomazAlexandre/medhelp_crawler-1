            "answer": "Hi,what is happening with your diet?Insulin does help you gain weight.\u00a0\u00a0The best way to minimise both the insulin (to what is actually needed) and help control weight is to follow a low carbohydrate diet.I am now doing this (eating about 50 g of carbs a day) and have managed to stop insulin for now (with good blood sugar numbers if I can keep within the carb limits) and lose weight.Calorie control is important for weight management, but I personally believe that carbohydrate control is even more important than the gross calories.Your doctor's way of dosing insulin is rather old-fashioned and there are new dosing regimes that can be more effective.\u00a0\u00a0Such as dosing your insulin to give a basal level, and then dosing based on carbs/fat/and protein in every meal.There is good information on line and website that offer support and information for lower carb diets and diabetes management.Please send me a message directly to my mailbox and I'll send you a link to a support community, if you are interested.Medhelp also has very good food and diabetes trackers, which i can highly recommend, and use daily.With education and knowledge diabetes can be well managed.\u00a0\u00a0Congratulations for starting on that path.",

            "answer": "It's all about diet and exercise, but the meds make it harder.\u00a0\u00a0You probably know to eat several small meals a day of low carb foods, which not only stabilizes your sugar but keeps your metabolism running high which makes you lose weight. Make sure you eat a handful of nuts every day besides the health benefits of this, people who eats nuts everyday tend to lose more weight!\u00a0\u00a0It's not as much about the caloric value of foods as it is sugar and carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Walking alone is a great exercise which is easy to do and will aid in weightloss. It's frustrating when the meds cause you to gain weight, but keep fighting back.\u00a0\u00a0Re-think your diet and make sure your are making the best choices, and increase your exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck, I hope you can get some of the weight off!",

            "answer": "To add to the great advice above go here for low carb recipeshttp://tinyurl.com/low-carb-recipesYou didn't mention your exercise regimen which should be 30-60 minutes daily. The first 20 minutes or so you're burning off excess glucose, then you burn fat for energy. If you're not breaking sweat your exercise program is lackadaisical. If you walk start slowly to warm up then pick up the pace as if you're late to catching your airline flight. Don't stroll like you're window shopping at the mall, try to walk with a purpose. When you feel it's time then move onto other programs that you feel will benefit you the most.Bear in mind the lifestyle changes you MUST make to prevent the progression of diabetes requires you to eat a diabetic diet, exercise daily, and maintain normal body weight. Fail or slack on one you defeat the others. Good luck",
