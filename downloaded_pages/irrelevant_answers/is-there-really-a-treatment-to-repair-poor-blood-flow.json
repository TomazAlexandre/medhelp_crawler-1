            "answer": "Fairyyzduzt, your post is not very clear. You mentioned diabetes and poor blood flow to the penis, but you don't really seem to know what is causing his ED. Did he suffer any lesions in the genital area? What did the doctors tell him? Has he tried a PDE-5 inhibitor (Levitra seems to be popular among diabetics) or Vigamed?If this is a case of arteriogenic ED, there are studies that demonstrate that taking a small dose of Viagra, Levitra, or Cialis every night before bed for several months (not just as needed for sexual activity) can improve erectile function long after one stops taking the pills. That is the beauty of this: it can still work AFTER you stop taking the pills.And there's a lot more you can do. Antioxidants such as vitamin E or pomegranate juice can improve blood circulation. I've been taking an excellent natural supplement called PRELOX (L-arginine aspartate + pycnogenol + taurine) and I'm very happy with the results.I hope this helps. Good luck and keep us posted!",

            "answer": "metrpolis- he has not suffered from any lesions, and his diabetes is under control with diet and exercise. None of the doctors even tested for poor blood flow ( we just recently found this is the problem) they just want to give him viagra or cialis. But since we have taken this problem back to his primary, he is running more test.thank you for your reply, it was very helpful.",

    "question": "My husband is 36 yrs old and has been having some problems getting an erection for about a 2 years now, at first his primary ran some test and found the he had borderline diabetes, since them he has resolved this issue and is still having problems. He has been to 2 diffrent urologist, they all seem to want to just give him pills and say he is too young for ED. 2 weeks ago we went to a clinic that only deals with ED and premature ejacultion, the said he he has poor blood flow, they suggested this penile injections twice a week over a period of 6 months. ( This clinic does not accept insurance) so we followed up with his primary, he prescriped the treatment said it would work but didn't really seem to think it would repair the problem. Does anyone had a simlar situation? and\u00a0\u00a0what course of treatment did you take? This is starting to affect our relationship even though I tell him will get through this like every rough patch that comes along. I know that I don't understand what he is going through, but I want to be supportive and help him through this. Sorry my post is so long. Thank you for any info anyone can give me.",
