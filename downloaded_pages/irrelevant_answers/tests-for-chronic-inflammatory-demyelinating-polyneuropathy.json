            "answer": "Hello dear,Following are the diagnostic tests foe chronic inflammatory demyleinating neuropathy-\u2022\tIn the CSF,cerebrospinal fluid testing , protein level is increased significantly in 80% of patients (usually between 50 and 200 mg/dL, but can be higher); 10% of patients also have mild lymphocytic pleocytosis ( <50 cells) and increased gamma globulin (usually associated with HIV infection).\u2022\tCBC count, sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibody, biochemistry profile, and serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis are necessary to exclude important associated systemic disorders.\u2022\tIn certain instances, genetic testing may be helpful. Examples include patients with positive family history, very insidious symmetric course of the disease, or some atypical features, including lack of treatment effect. Hereditary neuropathy with predisposition to pressure palsies can be suspected and tested for in some patients.\u2022\tImaging studies can provide supportive evidence of CIDP.\u2022\tMRI of the spine with gadolinium enhancement may show enhancement of nerve roots.\u2022\tEMG is a critical test to determine whether the disorder is truly a peripheral neuropathy and whether the neuropathy is demyelinating.\u2022\tPeripheral (sural) nerve biopsy is considered as supportive evidence of CIDP.Histologic FindingsTissue collected on biopsy of the sural nerve may demonstrate evidence of interstitial and perivascular infiltration of the endoneurium with inflammatory T cells and macrophages with local edema. Evidence exists of segmental demyelination and remyelination with occasional onion bulb formation, particularly in relapsing cases Some evidence of axonal damage also is observed, with loss of myelinated nerve fibers.Refer http://www.emedicine.com/neuro/TOPIC467.HTMBest",

            "answer": "A million thanks Dr. Navneet for such a comprehensive response. My husband has had nerve conduction tests, but EMG has not been mentioned so far. He is going to ask for a private consultation with a Professor of Neurology whose speciality is neuro-inflammatory disease and multiple sclerosis. The current Neurologist is so laid back he is almost comatose and we have no faith in him. We\u00a0\u00a0just want my husband to have a better quality of life as we are both becoming recluses with his inability to walk far, and motor problems in falling over.We do appreciate the time you have taken in responding.Liz & hubby.",

    "question": "My husband, 79 yrs, has been experiencing difficulty in walking more than 50 yds, some motor balance problem, numb feet and lower legs for some 6-7 yrs and problem is getting increasingly worse.\u00a0\u00a0He has seen a vascular surgeon and had a stent put in right leg 6 yrs ago for pvd, cardiologist, (angiogram showed one blocked artery of long standing, Cardio said not the problem and referred him to a neurosurgeon for suspected spinal cancal stenosis. Two MRI's showed scs but not enough to cause the problems. He referred husband to neurologist 16 months ago. Nerve conduction tests done in Nov 2007 by neurophysicist; tests showed \"consistent with sensory-motor, predominantly sensory, axonal peripheral neuropathy, although the neurophysicist felt this may not fully explain all of his problems.\"Back to neurologist 4 weeks ago - ordered comprehensive blood tests, no results as yet. He doesn't have any ideas, except fibromyalgia or diabetes, which we do not believe to be the cause.Is it possible my husband's symptoms are caused by Chronic Inflammatory Demyelination polyneuropathy? If so, what further testing can be done to confirm, so that he can get appropriate medication?Many thanks for your help.Liz.",
