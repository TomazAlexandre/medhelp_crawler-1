            "answer": "Hi,your results are not abnormal, for the post eating numbers.\u00a0\u00a0Essentially we can see that your blood sugars after eating are very close to the numbers you have before eating.\u00a0\u00a0The difference beween 102, 99, 95 and 93 is so small (and within meter accuracy), that we can consider your blood sugar is essentially stable, regardless of what you eat.Your fasting numbers are probably very slightly higher than ideal, which is most likely in the low - mid 80s, but does not raise any alarms at this point.I would recommend, given your family history, that you focus on eating a healthy diet (this is a diet that does not have too much refined carbs - jelly and toast is refined - but has healthy fats and proteins, and unprocess carbs coming mostly from vegetables and fruits). Paleo style, mediteranean (but with less bread/ grains), low carb high fat, primal... are ideas of possible approaches.Maintain normal weight, and exercise regularly (including ideally weight training and some vigorous aerobic activities).I commend you on your monitoring.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest that for now you monitor your fasting levels from time to time (daily is not necessary), to see how they go over time.\u00a0\u00a0Check post eating numbers at 1 - 2 hours occasionally after carby meals to catch if anything is changing.If your fasting levels are consistently over 100, it may be time to bring to the attention of your dr.\u00a0\u00a0However, they probably will not do more than watch for now, until your numbers get higher (or you can ask them if a low dose of metformin at bed time is worth taking).When you have your physical, ask your Dr to test Hba1c.\u00a0\u00a0This is an average 3 month blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Totally normal is < 5.0 (4.6 - 4.8).\u00a0\u00a0This test, over time, will allow you to monitor your blood sugar trends.Hope this is helpful to you.",

            "answer": "Hi,The stars are because I am moderator here. :)Your readings of 113 to 117 post eating are not alarming, however, if one wants to be pedantic about keeping things truly normal then they do bear watching.\u00a0\u00a0In non-diabetic people blood sugars rarely rise far from fasting levels (usually below 100).\u00a0\u00a0But no Dr. is going to act on the numbers you currently have.\u00a0\u00a0[Except maybe to agree to low dose metformin to address the fasting numbers].The higher blood sugar after 3 hours, is based on digestion rate.\u00a0\u00a0If you are eating foods, particularly with lots of fats, then the blood sugar rise will be delayed.From what you are saying, you probably are at long term risk of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0However, if that risk is ever realized, no one can say.Keep up the exercise, and look into low carb diet (I have athlete friends who use extra virgin coconut oil as their energy source during marathons and iron man distance events, and do very well.\u00a0\u00a0Their bodies have adapted to burning fat instead of carbs).\u00a0\u00a0 You can research this online.\u00a0\u00a0I believe low carb eating and exercise will keep problems at bay for a very long time, if not forever.Diabetes is a condition whose manifestation is intolerance / inability to properly handle carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the best way to manage it is to limit carb consumption (getting most from non-starchy veges).\u00a0\u00a0Protein has moderate effect on blood sugars, fats none for most people.\u00a0\u00a0Healthy fats are the naturally occurring ones (avoid transfats, vegetable oils, manmade fats).\u00a0\u00a0Saturated fats (from animal product), fish oils, coconut and other nut oils, full fat dairy are all better choices.",

    "question": "Today was typical.\u00a0\u00a0My fasting reading was 99 and 102 from fingertips.\u00a0\u00a0Just over one hour after eating two jelly toasts, Powerbar, banana and apple with orange juice and skim milk it had dropped to 93 and 95!!!\u00a0\u00a0I am not diabetic but since it runs in my family I am keeping tabs on my b.g.\u00a0\u00a0This seems odd.\u00a0\u00a0What is going on?",
