            "answer": "My husband has had diabetes for the past 20 years. He also feels fatigued. He gets cranky & flies off the handle easily when his sugar is not under good control(which i've been told is chartaristic in diabetics). Sounds like she needs to seek additional help from her doctor. Her blood sugar needs to be better controlled.",

    "question": "Hello,I've tried searching but I can not find a good answer to this question. My mother has had diabetes for 11 years. She was always able to keep her levels down with a good diet. But it seems like in the past two years it has slowly started going up. When she takes her blood sugar every morning it is around 190. Throughout the day it goes from 165 to 180.I am worried about her. She is feeling extremely fatigued. If she does certain things it makes her feel bad and really tired. Is it her blood sugar being so high that could cause this?I would really appreciate any input on this.Thank youDanyd",
