They come from the retina not getting enough blood (ischemia) they are most commonly due to high blood pressure or diabetes but other things can cause them.I cannot tell you anything more. I would suggest you see a Eye MD physician ophthalmologist. Your optometrist is not a physician, does not have a MD nor the extended training of an Eye MD. You can ask your family MD or the MD that treats your blood pressure to refer you or go to www.geteyesmart.org and find an Eye MD near you.JCH MD",
