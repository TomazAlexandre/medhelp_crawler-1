            "answer": "Thanks for your advice Dr. Hagan. I'm just wondering what could have caused my cataract? I had an FBS test and was negative for diabetes. Could a blunt trauma to my eye probably have caused it? when i was 12, I was bullied by one of my classmates and hit my head (my left eye) against the sharp corner of a pillar. I still had the scar on my eyebrows until now, but I didn't have any visual problems in the left eye only until now. My vision in both eyes were 20/20 before the cataract on left eye deteriorated my vision to only 20/60 in that eye. I've been very dependent on my right (good) eye now.",

    "question": "Hello! I've been diagnosed with a posterior subcapsular cataract in my left eye lately. My opthalmologist told me that it is unusual for someone my age (18) to have it. He told me that it might have been there since I was 11. He also told me that surgery is the only way to make me see clearly again. I'm also hold a brown belt in karate, and I am striving to get the black belt.I'm just wondering, can my cataract surgery have an impact on my karate career?",
