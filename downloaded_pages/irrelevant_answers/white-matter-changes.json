            "answer": "Hi,How are you?The MRI findings show non specific white matter changes which can occur due to aging, high BP, diabetes, stroke, MS, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and long standing alcoholism.The MRI also shows fracture skull with a subdural hematoma in the occipital region. This appears to be the result of traumatic brain injury.A mass is seen in the internal canal of the right ear which could be an acoustic neuroma.Hope this helps!",
