    "question": "Hi ladies,i have recently just developed a red rash on my face it starts on the upper right cheek and goes onto my forehead around my eye and then around onto the other side of my face. I have no idea what it is, it doesnt hurt, it doesnt itch.. it just looks like its blistered with red spots\u2026its\u2026.just odd. I called my doctor today who told me to see a dermatologist. this helped me non what so ever. I stopped taking my anti depressants two weeks ago, and the only thing i am taking is glumetza to try to stop the gestational diabetes from coming on. Last night was the first time i've taken it since i've been pregnant. i'm going to stop taking it tonight and see if the rash goes away. IF it does i know what it is, its just weird b/c its never happened before. I'm also taking citranatal pre natals as well. any suggestions?",
