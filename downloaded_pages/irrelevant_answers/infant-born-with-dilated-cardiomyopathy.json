            "answer": "Dr Boris thanks so much for your reply...her heart rate was only starting to be a concern around this mark...I did have weekly non stress tests...so you don't think the ehlers or marfan could have caused the heart issues? Could my gestational diabetes caused the heart issues or my age?? Scared at this point to even think about having another child in case this would happen again...thank you for your reply! Just so lost!!!",

            "answer": "Dear Tonic,The age of 37 years is considered by obstetricians to be \"advanced maternal age\", but only by 2 years.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, there is not a specific age concern as long as typical screening and monitoring occurs during the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0That said, there are no guarantees; 4% of all babies born have some typie of birth defect, so it is more common than most folks realize.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is felt not to cause cardiac issues if there is good glycemic control, which it sounds like you had.\u00a0\u00a0Vascular type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (also known as Type IV) can cause rupture of blood vessels, as well as certain other organs.\u00a0\u00a0However, long fingers is not necessarily the giveaway here.\u00a0\u00a0Marfan syndrome also causes aortic dilation and severe mitral valve prolapse in the infantile form, but that's not what you're describing.\u00a0\u00a0Although the bloodwork came back as no viruses present (assuming the right viruses were looked for), it certainly could have been some sort of viral myocarditis.\u00a0\u00a0I would definitely meet with your OB/GYN and pediatric cardiologist, and discuss these issues further in depth to get them explained more, especially once you get the rest of the genetic testing back.",

            "answer": "I really appreciate your insight into everything our pediatric cardiologist has basically just said she had dilated carsiomyopathy and thinks it is either due to the cause of a genetic tissue disorder or metabolic reasons...I just don't want to stop until I find out what exactly happened!! After the genetics come back do you do any outside research if I have all of mine and her paperwork and files??? Thanks so much I really appreciate all of your answers!!",

            "answer": "Dear Tonic,The problem is that dilated cardiomyopathy has a multitude of genetic etiologies as well as other reasons.\u00a0\u00a0Without knowing all of the information about what happened, the list could be quite long AND we may never get all of the data available.\u00a0\u00a0Certainly, you are welcome to get a second opinion and meet with a pediatric cardiologist who is an expert in cardiomyopathies, which makes sense if your cardiologist is not comfortable in further evaluation at this time.",

    "question": "Hello. Hoping you can give me some insight. I am 37 and just lost our daughter 2 months ago. At a 36 week sonogram we found out her heart was grossly enlarged. Delivered the same day to access. She didn't have much movement and we never saw her with her eyes opened. The only problem in my pregnancy was gest diabetes which was diet controlled. After we almost list her after the first day she was placed on ecmo. Her abdomen was enlarging and found her liver had ruptured from the heart working so hard. She had abdominal surgery which removed a portion of intestine that had died off and that part was fixed. They finally got her heart into rythem after shocking it and that stayed normal. They thought her fingers were long and she was 95% for height. Waiting on genetics for an ehlers danlos syndrome or marfan but we know of no known cases in the family. Any ideas??? We are just lost and need answers!!",
