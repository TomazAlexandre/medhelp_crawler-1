    "question": "Hi all,Just thought i would say a quick hi to let you lot know i am still around (and feeling very healthy!!!) i was reading some threads earlier where questions were asked in regards to Interferon.... Well i had the year treatment, finishing at the end of last year... I was told bout' all the side-effects etc.... but apart from the fear of injections, which was weekly administered by my beloved girlfriend... I can honestly say i had possibly the least side effects possible. The only thing i noticed was that my skin became unbearably itchy at times.... Pretty much my arms, back and inside of my legs. Now i don't know whether it had anything to do with the medi but all the itchiness has stopped now.... HHHMMM... I continued work (took 1-2 sick day off, not related to my Hep B, all year), continued to drive, continued to play sports, weights and generally felt like i did b4 i knew i had HBV. The only downside was, interferon didn't bring that the viral load my hepatologist expected and so i am currently on combo treatment of Lumuvidine and Adevoir... Its all good tho guys, keep your head up..... Frankly the only thing that really scared me was reading up on side-effects such as developing diabetes etc....BTW: Zelly and Steve I am still currently awaiting my stats from the docs so as soon as i get them i wil post them on for you forum junkies to view and possibly advise on....Have a great day guys!!!1",
