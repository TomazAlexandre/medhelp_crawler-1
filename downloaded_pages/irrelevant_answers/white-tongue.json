I'm not sure what cleared it though, the antifungal or the antibiotic.",

            "answer": "I've had them checked and there's nothing wrong.Also checked for diabetes and all normal.Doesn't seem to be any sort of deficiency or problem with blood work.Anti fungals do nothing at all so I'm convinced it's not thrush and it's not a fungus.I was given an antibiotic which cleared it up in a day. It was totally pink except a tiny bit right at the back.Unfortunately by day 3 the antibiotics, clarithromycin stopped having the same effect and it had grown back, not as much as before but it was back.Doctor then gave it to me to take twice a day for another 5 days and it held steady.I've now been taking metronidazole for 2 days which has improved it slightly but doesn't seem like it will get rid of it. It didn't have that immediate effect of the clarithromycin either.I'm convinced because the clarithromycin got rid of it that its a bacteria but why do the antibiotics stop working so quickly.Please is there anyone that can help me, I've had it for 3 months now and really just want my normal pink tongue back.Please please help I'm desperate",

    "question": "HiI've had a white coated tongue for almost 2 months now and can't get rid of it.I've tried brushing it with hydrogen peroxide, glycerine, nystatin drops, nothing gets rid of it.I was worried it could be related to an STI as I recently had a condom break which left me very anxious but so far I have tested negative on all my tests.Doctors have told me it's stress or breathing through mouth but nothing seems to make it go away.They say it's not thrush or I would have chunks like cottage cheese on cheeks and back of mouth too.I was even thinking of diabetes but every time I test my glucose levels seem normal.I was wondering whether it could be from antibiotics?About 2 weeks before it first appeared I did take strong antibiotics that the doctor gave me as a precaution for STI's. I also took a fluconazole at the same time because i had balanitis.I'm worried this may have destroyed all the good bacteria.I have been taking probiotics but that hasn't helped either.My latest attempt at getting rid of it is the nystatin drops but after four days I notice no difference.Any ideas?Please help",
