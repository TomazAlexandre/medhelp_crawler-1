            "answer": "First it's suggested that weight loss average 2 lbs per week, no more. This is a somewhat slow pace, but it's a safe pace. If you loose weight too fast, it can cause problems. Based on this considered healthy average you can safely loose 104 lbs in one year. So to loose all the weight you want to it is suggested that your overall goal be placed around 1.5 years. Unfortunately sometimes it's hard to hit that 2lb per week mark and so it feels a little discouraging at times when you look at your goal and it's so far a head of you.Because of this, I strongly suggest having shorter goals. This weight is completely in your power to loose, but it will be hard and it can be difficult to stay motivated. In my personal journey it's been much easier for me to try to manage short easily attainable goals. My overall weight loss since I started to my goal is about 109lbs. I've hit a few plateaus and it makes that 126 goal seem impossible (almost 70lbs away)- so my immediate goal is much closer only 10lbs away. I've already lost 39lbs, what's 10 more? I can do that. Having those goals right in your reach, in my opinion, helps keep you motivated.Also as far as weight loss, try to not base everything off the number. Weight can vary several pounds in a day due to food and water intake so try not to weigh yourself more than once a week. Also, because you will start to gain muscle mass as you exercise, you will reach a point where you loose inches not lbs. Measure yourself once a month for these changes, because even if the scales say the same, if the jeans are tighter that's success.Remember to find a healthy balanced diet to pair with a good exercise routine and stick to it. As far as diet goes, remember starving yourself or eating at random times can cause problems with metabolism and make you retain weight. So eat all 3 meals, a couple snacks in a day and never ever starve yourself.Based on your size, personally I suggest looking into low impact exercise to start out with such as swimming or aqua aerobics. Working in a water environment puts much less strain on your back, knees, and feet allowing you to exercise better. Also I find that it's easier to control breathing (exercise induced asthma) when I'm in the pool. This is based on my own experience, but I strongly suggest looking into it.Also, I have to mention, I've got Hashimoto's. Although I started loosing weight after removing all the junk food from my diet I stayed the same weight for 5 months until I got my thyroid in check. There are certain hormonal and medical diseases that can impede weight loss. Ignoring these do no favors. I suggest you get an overall health check up. Ask for a thyroid check, making sure to ask for free T3 and t4 testing as they are more reliable than the standard TSH test. It might also be a good idea to test for diabetes. You are very young, but it needs to be ruled out because having diabetes means you have to be extra careful with exercise and eating- keeping your blood from going to dangerous highs or lows. It may seem like an odd precaution, but it's worth while to know what's going on with your body before trying anything extreme.Finally remember at the end of the day the weight didn't come on overnight, it cannot go away that fast. Aim for health. Give yourself both attainable weight loss goals (5, 10 lbs etc) and exercise goals (1 lap in the pool in so many seconds). And if there is a moment of doubt, a moment of weakness, forgive yourself. Chocolate temptations are no easier at 190 then they were at 235 for me, but my will is stronger- that's the key. Good luck!",

            "answer": "That's a big drop. I would say in a year, if you're really dedicated to your diet and exercise plan, and eat low-carb and low-fat, you might be able to get to the 260's. You're talking about losing almost 200 lbs. It's bad to lose so much weight so fast.Take it slow. It'll pay off in the long run, trust me, because you'll keep the weight off instead of rebounding.If you need any exercise or diet tips, you can message me!~ Em",

            "answer": "Before going further you need a consult with an endochronologist. Weight in the area of 300 pounds is often due to a metabolic disorder and the weight loss should be done with a physician's oversight. In all probability you are not responsible for the weight gain. You need to find an endochonologist who specialized in weight loss. Carbohydrate cravings go hand in hand with diabetes, form example. If there is an insulin utilization problem, you could well end up hypoglycemic (low blood sugar) and unconscious dieting even though you have fat to burn. So daily testing with an glucose meter, a thyroid function test, as well as a test called an hba1c is in order. This isn't simply a matter of dieting and exercise. Yes, these are two significant componants but you need a medical examination from someone other than a General practicioner. Generally this is the ballpark of the endochronologist. He or she will refer you to a dietician, and may provide medications to increase your basal metabolism.",
