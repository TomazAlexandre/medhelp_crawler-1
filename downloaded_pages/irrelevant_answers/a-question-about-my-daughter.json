            "answer": "Yes, that is a bit high for a fasting. Normal fasting blood sugars should be under 100. 100-125 is considered pre-diabetes and 126 and over is considered diabetic. I would take her in and have her tested so you know where to go from here. Also if she is diabetic, be sure they find her Type by antibody testing.",

I have Type I and my glucose levels elevate if I don't eat.\u00a0\u00a0Her body is trying to send her sugar for energy (and food), so her levels are going to be up.\u00a0\u00a0Start having her eat low-sugar snacks every couple of hours, and try to eat 4-6 SMALL meals a day.\u00a0\u00a0In any case, a visit to the doctor can't hurt!",

    "question": "What are normal blood sugar ranges for a teen-ager? I test my children periodically because I have T2 Diabetes. A few days ago, I tested my 17 year old daughter and it was 111 after not eating for 4 hours. So, I tested her again in the morning to get a fasting Blood Sugar and it was 123. Should I be worried and should I take her in to get her tested?",
