            "answer": "I gave up about 30 years ago on everything that just does 'before meal' 'after meal'.\u00a0\u00a0What I do now (the idea was given me by my pump trainer) is an excel spreadsheet.\u00a0\u00a0I have a column for every hour (of course I could do every 30 minutes, but it wouldn't print nicely to take to the doctor).\u00a0\u00a0Then for every day I hace a row for 1) blood glucose 2) carbs 3) meal bolus (insulin) 4) correction bolus (insulin) 5) notes.\u00a0\u00a0This can be customized so you can add a row if you are using more than one type of insulin.\u00a0\u00a0This allows you to see the the interaction of time of day, food, insulin, and whatever you put into the notes row.\u00a0\u00a0THis could be exercise, new infusion site if on a pump, if a high fat food such as pizza was part of the meal, or whatever you need. I make a code to cover the notes; for example 'site' can be a site change, 'e15' could be 15 minutes of exercise. More data, can show more than logs.\u00a0\u00a0Over time, it is essential to do both good control and good living.\u00a0\u00a0This helps.",

    "question": "The diabetes tracker is great but we would like to suggest some adjustments.We are using this as a family to track our teen son's new disease.\u00a0\u00a0We would like to be able to track the disease by each dose. For instance - we need to be able to enter the time of the test - not just \"Before/after x meal\"\u00a0\u00a0We are on high management and we need to see if a missed dose or miscalculation on a meal makes a difference.\u00a0\u00a0And there are occasional times that he is low and we have to track several times in a short period until he gets back to the target zone.It would be cool if we could enter a time, a bg reading, a carb count, and amount insulin taken.\u00a0\u00a0(That is calculated for bg and for carbs).\u00a0\u00a0Having this all on one window would be AWESOME!\u00a0\u00a0Then later if he shoots up to a high reading we can look to see if he took the proper amount or skipped a step.Missed doses are a problem and if we could check a box that says missed dose or miscalculation, then we could track how many times a day there is a problem and track the improvement in that area.Or we would like to be able to change the title of the labels.\u00a0\u00a0For instance: we would like to change the After breakfast to After 1st period, and the after lunch to after school.\u00a0\u00a0And we would like to add - \"Before lunch lows\"\u00a0\u00a0this has been a period were he gets low occasionally and we need to see how often.Thank you for your program and your help.",
