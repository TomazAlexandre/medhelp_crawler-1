            "answer": "It's a good idea to speak to your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Print out the material you are reading, and take it in, and say this is exactly what happens to you.\u00a0\u00a0A friend of mine correctly diagnosed that he had diabetes from reading medical websites, and another was able to figure out that his son had appendicitis, so even though people who have the tendency to be hypochondriacs probably have no business reading the Internet and brooding on every symptom, it is also true that people can sometimes accurately identify what they have by looking online.\u00a0\u00a0The next step is to see a doctor, though, not to ask on a website.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

    "question": "I'm 16, going on 17, and I believe to have something called a \"stereotypy disorder\". I haven't been diagnosed, but my symptoms match up perfectly with the symptoms that the disorder describes. When I'm overly excited, my hands, face, feet, and arms will begin to shake involuntarily and uncontrollably for about a few seconds, until I notice I'm doing it and can stop it. Other than that, I'm completely normal, and have no issues whatsoever. So am I right in assuming that I have a stereotypy disorder?",
