I actually almost posted to you about being a volunteer/moderater on here too, then saw the Med-Help request for you to do this.I realize we post with a lot of emotion at times and we also vent a little at times. Dr.s I realize must remain emotionally uninvolved and I for one understand that and hope others do too.We also understand, depending upon your schedule, that you can only advice posters, when time permits. Thank you in advance for those times you are able to reply.Sincerely,JimLow",
