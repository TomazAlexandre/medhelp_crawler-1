    "question": "Hi,\u00a0\u00a0I'm a 32 yr male who is moderately over weight.\u00a0\u00a0 I don't have diabetes or anything like that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I started one day having this aching feeling over on the far side of my abdomen, maybe 3-5 inches below my right rib cage.\u00a0\u00a0 At first I wondered if I have a gall stone or something, but then I wondered if it was too low......then I realized that pressing around on the area doesn't cause extra pain, but breathing in past a certain point increases the pain feeling.\u00a0\u00a0 I would say it's a mild to moderate pain, not severe, but it's not normal...so the question would be does it seem like an organ or simply muscular or something like that?",
