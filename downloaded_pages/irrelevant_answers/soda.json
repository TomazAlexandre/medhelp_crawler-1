            "answer": "There is research that suggests a high-sugar diet during pregnancy can make the baby more likely to get diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If you are drinking sugared drinks (high fructose corn syrup) please limit yourself to one can a day, even that amount has the equivalent of 12 teaspoons of sugar in it.\u00a0\u00a0If you are drinking diet soda, big problems -- the chemicals they use in them are (by some accounts) even worse for you than sugar.If you want to wean yourself off soda pop, try this -- get some sparkling water (not soda water, which is full of sodium, but sold as seltzer water or sparkling water) and mix it half and half with the soda pop you're hooked on.\u00a0\u00a0Soon you'll find that the regular kind tastes like syrup and the half-cut kind tastes just fine.\u00a0\u00a0Then try cutting back even farther than that.",
