            "answer": "we are in the midst of waiting for our nj kid care to kick in. After 12 years with insurance we find ourselves suddenly without it.My husband, my sister and both of my husbands parents are diabetic so we are worried about that as well.\u00a0\u00a0We have tested her sugar a few times with his meter and haven't found anything alarming.\u00a0\u00a0She was born a premie (8 weeks early) and has always had respitory trouble and asthma. We have put her on the same careful eating that my husband follows with his diabetes because it's just a very healthy way of eating and we figure it can only help.\u00a0\u00a0I just don't know what to do in the mean time while we wait for the insurance....Any ideas?",

            "answer": "Has she been trying to lose the 20lbs she put on? Weight loss will break down fat, which will increase ketones, if carbohydrates are not being eaten that much. I would suggest following the diabetic diet which you are already doing and go for additional tests when the insurance starts.",
