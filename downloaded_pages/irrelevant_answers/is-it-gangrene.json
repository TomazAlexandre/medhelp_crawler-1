            "answer": "For the other readers, caustic pencils are long sticks that look like matches and on the tip they contain silver nitrate.\u00a0\u00a0Silver nitrate when concentrated causes cauterization of tissue.\u00a0\u00a0 Silver nitrate is also capable of staining skin black.\u00a0\u00a0 When diltuted, silver nitrate is used as a topical antibiotic.\u00a0\u00a0It used to be very popular and many burn centers around the world still use it.\u00a0\u00a0When used as an antibiotic the problem was it stains everything black.\u00a0\u00a0Often, its hard to tell burned from unburned tissue after everything has been stained.\u00a0\u00a0Even the floors get stained blacked.You mention that the toe is looking shriveling up, that is rather worrisome for gangrene.\u00a0\u00a0In your second foot you mention that you are diabetic and that the foot is infected.\u00a0\u00a0This problem deserves some significant discussion.-wounds or foot infection in diabetics are always a serious problem.\u00a0\u00a0An infected foot infection in a diabetic is typically something that warrants hospital infection.\u00a0\u00a0It is very easy for such an infection to get out of control as well as the infection to cause the diabetes out of control.-how serious is your diabetes and are you on insulin?\u00a0\u00a0 Diabetes causes narrowing of arteries that can greatly impair or slow wound healing.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, any wound may be difficult to heal.\u00a0\u00a0Prior to any type of amputation, one has to determine if the wound will heal.\u00a0\u00a0 So the next question is do you have pain in your buttocks or legs when you walk a distance.\u00a0\u00a0 If you do, this would indicate arterial disease (not uncommon for a diabetic).\u00a0\u00a0Why is this a big deal if your toe needs an amputation?\u00a0\u00a0 Well if you have arterial disease, the arteries might not be able to carry enough blood to heal the surgical wound.\u00a0\u00a0If that were the case vascular surgeons might have to angioplasty a narrowed artery to improve blood flow and help wounds heal.-infections cause diabetes to be more difficult to control.\u00a0\u00a0When blood sugars are elevated, wounds don\u2019t heal as well.",
