            "answer": "I am 53 years old, no diabetes... however I have been told I am one point away from hypoglycemic. As far as I know I don't have hypertension but I am under a lot of stress. I have a full-time job, take care of my 95 year old grandmother with Alzheimers, and my 64 year old Aunt who is mentally challenged. However, I have to say most of the time I am ok and not a stressed out mess, but on occasions it all gets to me. My last couple of blood pressure readings have been 120/66 and 130/76. I am currently taking liquid vitamin B-Complex, plus calcium and a multi-vitamin. This is all the medicines I take. My numbness has been going on for a couple of weeks now. I have a small amount of ear itching and a small (very small) drainage problem....just enough to show up on a tissue when I stick my pinky finger in my ear with the tissue covering it.",
