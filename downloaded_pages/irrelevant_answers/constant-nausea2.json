            "answer": "HiThanks for the note.The lump at the side of your neck could be a lymph node, a thyroid swelling or a parathyroid swelling. However parathyroid swellings are not common. Also your serum calcium levels have been normal so again there is hardly a chance that it is a parathyroid swelling. Lymph nodes in the neck are commonly felt in infection of head and neck area, dandruff, tooth decay etc.Please consult an ENT to rule out internal ear problems. Please let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted.",
