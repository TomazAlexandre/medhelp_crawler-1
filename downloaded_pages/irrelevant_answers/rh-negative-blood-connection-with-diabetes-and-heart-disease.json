            "answer": "There are as far as I know no know studies documenting this link to either cancer or autoimmune disease. There are observational studies showing links between cholesterol subtypes and alzheimer's dementia, and others, but none with the connection you are seeking. In any case, since you can't change your blood type, the best thing you can do is to be conscious that this runs in your family, and that it is immaterial on whether or not these are linked to specific blood groups inasmuch as your family carries many different genetic haplotypes. So, to minimize this risk\u00a0\u00a0you should watch out and minimize the risk factors for developing such diseases, such as obesity, which is linked with heart disease and making sure you follow strict cancer screening guidelines.",

    "question": "Does Rh-neg blood type have a low risk for cancer, but a high risk for diabetes, heart disease & autoimmune problems?A large number of family members on my mother's side (about 10 so far) who are Rh-negative blood type have died or having major problems with diabetes, heart diseaseand\u00a0\u00a0autoimmune system. The other side of my family are Rh positive and they are being stricken with various types of cancer (about 8 so far), but they do not have the other health problems. Both sides of my family are having problems controlling their weight. Has there been any research on the subject of blood type illnesses?",
