            "answer": "As I have not personally reviewed your MRI I cannot give you an accurate medical opinion regarding your particular case.\u00a0\u00a0What I can say is that the location of the lesions or abnormalities that is described in the MRI report that you have provided are NOT typical for MS.\u00a0\u00a0Rather, they are located in areas that are more characteristic for small vessel disease (little tiny blood vessels that become occluded leading to very small strokes) related to diabetes and hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0Based on those findings, it is very unlikely that they represent MS.\u00a0\u00a0I would have to agree with the final sentence of the MRI report.\u00a0\u00a0Hope that helps.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your advice.\u00a0\u00a0Althought I am sort of between a rock and a hard place.\u00a0\u00a0If it were MS, it would have been treatable by drugs.\u00a0\u00a0TIA's are much harder to treat. As I am now on blood thinner Plavix + Aspirin, if they continue to happen, there is not much more I can do. I could just slowly loose feeling in various parts of my body, till major things went wrong.\u00a0\u00a0Not an easy thing to live with.",
