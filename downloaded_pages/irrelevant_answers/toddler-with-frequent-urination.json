            "answer": "Hi.Has your doctor advised you for a follow up consult?If not, then I suggest that you get a second opinion about this. An abdominal scan of the kidneys, ureter and bladder may be necessary to help rule out underlying involvement of the said structures. I also suggest that a repeat urinalysis and urine culture be done.When did this start?Does your child drink a lot of water each day?Was there any recent onset of fever and flulike symptoms?",

            "answer": "nothing else is wrong with her. She doesn't have any other symptoms. i took her to the ER today and they did another urine test which came back clear and they did a blood test for diabetes. Everything turned out fine, but while we were there (3 1/2 hours) she peed 21 times. They did the urine test on the 6th pee and she peed half the cup full, and it was as clear as water. Any ideas on what else it could be? And yes, she drinks plenty of fluid everyday.",
