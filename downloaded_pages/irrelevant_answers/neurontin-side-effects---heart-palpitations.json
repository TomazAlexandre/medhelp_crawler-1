    "question": "My doctor prescribed neurontin to treat neuropathy pain in my feet about two yrs ago.\u00a0\u00a0I originally took 300 mg capsules every 3 1/2 hours up to 1,500 mgs per day.\u00a0\u00a0The cost of this medication is a financial strain as I have no insurance & pay about $225.00 per month for it.\u00a0\u00a0I have a close friend that was also on neurontin for a while but had to discontinue use.\u00a0\u00a0My friend gave me his remaining neurontin but it is in tablet form instead of capsules.\u00a0\u00a0His tablets are 600 mgs. so I have been splitting them in half.\u00a0\u00a0My first question:\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering if it is safe to split neurontin tablets?\u00a0\u00a0I've been told that it is not safe to split some tablets.\u00a0\u00a0Also about 3 weeks ago I started having very fast heart plapitations around 123 per minute.\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure was also elevated to 170/100.\u00a0\u00a0I went to my health clinic to address this concern & my doctor immediately put me on Accupril & told me to check my heart rate later in the day & if it wasn't lowered to come back in.\u00a0\u00a0I also have a follow-up appt. in a few days.\u00a0\u00a0My heart rate has come down but still seems too fast at times.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering if the Neurontin might have something to do with the increased heart rate I experienced?\u00a0\u00a0Especially since I switched from capsules to split tabs?\u00a0\u00a0I should also tell you that I have been taking neurontin for almost 2 yrs. in the capsule form & only recently started taking the split neurontin tablets.\u00a0\u00a0Changing over to the split tabs is the only recent medication change that I've had & shortly afterwards is when I experienced the elevated heart rate.\u00a0\u00a0My heart rate has come down since taking the Accupril.\u00a0\u00a0I am only 43 yrs old & feel that I am on too much medication.\u00a0\u00a0I have type II diabetes which was caught right away since my Dad is also diabetic & has checked my sugar levels every few months & I went to my Dr fairly soon after discovering elevated sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0My blood sugar levels have never been over 150 & are usually in the 116 - 125 range.\u00a0\u00a0I am over-weight (currently 235 lbs on 5'8\" frame) but have lost 35 lbs & am still working on it.\u00a0\u00a0I am not convinced that my neuropathy is a side effect of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I took the drug phen - phen & have met several other people that also have neuropathy in their feet & hands after taking this drug.\u00a0\u00a0I should also mention that I take amitriptyline for my neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0The meds I am on are:\u00a0\u00a0Glucophage 1,000 mgs twice per day, amitriptyline 25 mgs twice per day, Zetia 10 mg per day, Accupril 10 mgs per day & Neurontin 1,500 mgs per day.\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate any advice or opinions you might have.\u00a0\u00a0I would give anything to get rid of the neuropathy & am working on losing more weight in hopes that it may help.\u00a0\u00a0I am very concerned about my increased heart rate & b/p.\u00a0\u00a0If I have to discontinue Neurontin I hope there is another alternative to alleviate the pain which is pretty severe without the Neurontin.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much for your help!\u00a0\u00a0I am hesitant to tell my Dr. that I am taking my friends neurontin tabs.",
