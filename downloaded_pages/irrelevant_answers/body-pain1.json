            "answer": "Stange.I would speculate that it is nerve related. Possibly when you sit you are aggrevating a nerve(s) as that position causes something to press and compress. I would doubt it is a disc problem since the symptoms do not manifest\u00a0\u00a0when you are standing /walking/etc.I would go to a Doctor. Probably an orthopedist and explain your symptoms. An MRI or CT scan might be preferable to eliminate things like small masses, etc.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Hi Jude,How are you feeling?I think what you are having is a more of generalized cause rather than a localized one.Pain, tingling and numbness are signs of neuropathy. Nerve involvement may be single (mono-neuropathy) or multiple (poly-neuropathy).This neuropathy could be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.You should be doing HbA1C, ESR, serum protein/immuno-electrophoresis, and vitamin B12, BUN, and creatinine levels.You can consult a physician and an orthopaedician for further evaluation.Keep me informed if you have any queries.Bye.",

            "answer": "Hi Judexx,I would agree with Dr. Jain.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with Fibro but sent to a Neurologist because I was having neuropathy in hands, feet, and chin.\u00a0\u00a0I was also dropping things and my handwriting was terrible.\u00a0\u00a0I did have those tests suggested by Dr. Jain and my Vitamin B wa 126, it said right on the test that anything lower than 300 would cause neurological symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I started taking b12 2000mg orally per day and within a week I had no more neurological problems.\u00a0\u00a0I did have a problem with the fillers in the b12 oral due to Interstitial Cystitis and severe bladder pain .\u00a0\u00a0I switched to monthly shots and have been fine since as far as neurological problems since then.\u00a0\u00a0I also have bile salt induced diahrrea from cholestomy done in 1994.\u00a0\u00a0I went through 10 years of constant, explosive diahrrea which left me in a malabsortive state during those 10 years.\u00a0\u00a0I was not able to keep any food or drink in my system for any length of time, I would have to stop on the side of the road, the urgency to deficate was so strong.\u00a0\u00a0Not a pretty picture I know, but having not absorbed essential vitamins left me with anemia and a severe b-12 deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0I agree with Dr. Jain, ty to have those tests done, it could be neuropathy due to lack of b-12 as was my case.\u00a0\u00a0A very easy fix, compared to my other disorders.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you, hopefully it will be something easy like my situation with neuropathy.Kindest regards- Lanaiwahine",
