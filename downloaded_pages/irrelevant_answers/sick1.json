            "answer": "Sounds like anxiety and panic attacks. The panic attacks will make you feel dizzy, distort sound, cause muscle tension in the chest, numbness/tingling in the extremities along with sweats. You might sometimes have a ringing in the ears during a panic attack. Body aches can often occur with depression. Depression and anxiety often occur together because of the imbalance of the neurotransmitters in the brain. I recommend seeing a psychiatrist over a regular doctor. A psychiatrist would be able to address depression/anxiety with medication and therapy if that is the problem. However, make sure you have been checked for diabetes and potassium levels, since that could account for the sweats/dizziness.",
