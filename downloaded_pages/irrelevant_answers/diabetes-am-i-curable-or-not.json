            "answer": "\"The doctor said exercise and losing weight will REVERSE my diabetes diagnosis/reading, and I will be able to go off the oral medication she is giving me?\"People who sustain long periods of above normal blood sugar levels usually remain diabetic. This could be attributed to lifestyle factors or genetic susceptibility - inherited a diabetic gene. Recent studies show a major contributing factor to t2 diabetes is obesity. Weight loss has been shown to \"reverse\" one back to normal levels in some people, not all. Reversing diabetes is not an absolute it is a possibility. You need to live the lifestyle changes one makes. This includes eating a proper diabetic nutrition, and maintaining normal Lipid panel to weight loss, and daily 30-60 minutes of exercise. Maintain does not mean cheating a little bit, eating a slice of cake or having a sweet drink every now and then will just put you back where you don't want to be. In order to remain diabetes free one must continue living their lifestyle changes. One must always follow doctor's instructions and have annual checkups too.Your glucose serum test results detected prediabetes. However, your 6.6% A1c raised a huge red flag putting you well into diabetes land with an estimated daily glucose average of 143 mg/dl.\"Thus, could it be a fluke reading? Am I curable? Should I get a 2nd opinion? The doctor didn't even tell me to test my levels or give me a particular diet to follow -- she just said I should lose weight and will be able to go off meds.\"1. The A1c is not a fluke, it doesn't lie.2. Currently diabetes has no cure. Like I stated above, it is possible to reverse your condition by making and maintaining lifestyle changes.3. The A1c was your 2nd opinion4. Your doctor is not a dietician. Read other threads on this forum. Proper nutrition - foods to avoid and foods to eat - have been mentioned numerous times. If you continue to have problems ask for a referral to dietician and/or diabetes nutritionist to discuss what you can/cannot eat. This includes portion sizes.5. Glucose test meters can be purchased at your local pharmacy, or Wal*Mart and Walgreens for around $10. Meters are good friends. W/o one you cannot tell what your blood sugars are doing.Times to test are:* Preprandial - before a meal. You should be at normal range levels - 60/70 to 99 mg/dl* Postprandial - 2-3 hrs after a meal. Postprandial testing informs you if the food/s you ate are jacking up your levels. Avoid those that do. Diabetics aim for <141 mg/dl, better <121 mg/dl. Of course, optimum levels are within normal range levels.If you decide to obtain a meter carefully read the accompanying instruction sheet. Not all meters are alike, some require calibration others not and so on.If you have further questions post back to this thread. Good luck -",

            "answer": "First of all, meds for what? The high blood pressure or the diabetes? Your readings suggest a pre-diabetic state and I am not sure why she would put you on meds. Also, you should have been instructed on how to use a meter and given one by the doctor. If you are on diabetic meds (pill form) then you absolutely need to be checking your blood sugars! If not, you could go into hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and pass out or worse. So call your doctor back and ask her these questions! Never leave a doctor's office until you know exactly why you are being given a med and how to take it and what to do if you have side effects. You really need to be more proactive and a good advocate for your own healthcare. Get on that phone!",

            "answer": "Don't need a meter. I am on Medforum -- which does not lower the glucose/serum. A recent visit before and after a meal show my glucose/serum 113 to 118. Well within the range I've been . . . all my vitals are nearly perfect.Yes, I am totally reversible, actually. A chat with my doctor and another doctor -- have shown this is true for me. I was not diabetic six months ago. This is very new for me. Secondly, I have on a diabetic eating program now through Nutrisystem, where I have access -- daily -- to a Nutritionist.It's going well, I've lost six pounds in just over eight days. Thank you, though, for your opinions.",
