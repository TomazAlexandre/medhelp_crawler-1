            "answer": "I could be wrong but i didnt think 70 is thought to be particularly old in Japan, so old age might not be such an issues as it is in other countries. It sounds to me like he had a mini stroke or TIA, it definitely sounds like something neurological has happened because of his out of charactor behaviors since this event. The pre-diabetes could have actually caused it to happen if his blood sugars dropped low enough to put him into a hypo state, so i would be looking into how he's managing his blood sugar levels, or if he's doing anything for it.I could be way off but it makes sense to me to start with his his pre-diabetise.Cheers.........JJ",

            "answer": "I am onboard with the others here. It seems like a small stroke which can cause heat sensitivity after the fact.One other thought could be migranes since they cause light sensitivity. I think no matter how old we are we deserve to have good health care if it is available. It certainly doesn't sound normal. If so, wouldn't most 70 year olds have the same symptoms? If is abnormal, keep looking for answers.Have they tested for and ruled out strokes?",

            "answer": "I know you're an excellent online researcher Sho.\u00a0\u00a0I'd send you in the direction of an autonomic system dysfunction.\u00a0\u00a0Several of them are more common in the elderly population.\u00a0\u00a0With the history of diabetes I'd look at Diabetic Autonomic Neuropathy first.A lot of your father-in-law's symptoms would fit and it would make sense that they come and go.\u00a0\u00a0Dysautonomias can cause changes in BP, heart rate, fluid volume, blood sugars, electrolyte balance, etc. etc. etc.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms might not have been overly apparent in the hospital (even with an extended stay) if it was a controlled environment with less stressors on his physiology than daily life at home.It can be very hard to piece together autonomic dysfunction because it looks inconsistent.\u00a0\u00a0In truth, you sometimes have to be looking for the symptoms so you are prepared to glimpse their fleeting appearances.\u00a0\u00a0There are specific testing procedures that use controlled conditions to force symptoms.I'd also be wondering if they started any new medications to treat whatever-it-is without really finding out what it is.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't be surprised if that happens in all countries and cultures (and sometimes it is a good idea or the only option).\u00a0\u00a0But if this is a dysautonomic problem, the treatment (no cure) could actually be quite different than what is routinely prescribed for diabetes and circulatory problems.Eye problems from nerve damage occur in a high percentage of people with diabetes despite excellent control of blood glucose levels.\u00a0\u00a0I wonder if that isn't also a contributing factor.I hope something in here can help you, your hubby and his honorable parents.\u00a0\u00a0How nice it would be if everyone could get some relaxed enjoyment during his visit.\u00a0\u00a0Diagnostic answers could also go far to create a higher level of comfort for you all when it comes time for hubby to leave.\u00a0\u00a0Please let us know how it goes.Mary",

I would have to side with Mary and the\u00a0\u00a0dysautonomia for the answer of the majority of his symptoms.The diabetes would lend itself to confusion and/or a TIA connected to the driving incident that landed him in the hospital. Dementia will produce some of the symptoms as well. My personal opinion is he has multiple conditions that each lend themselves to a\u00a0\u00a0portion of the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0The sudden inability to drive a TIA\u00a0\u00a0or small stroke and resultant confusion. The photophobia (light sensitivity) and muscle control could be Parkison's disease. Here is a link to an abstract from BMJ:http://pn.bmj.com/content/6/1/28.extractThe abstract does touch on almost all of his issues. Perhaps this is the problem.I sincerely hope that a solution can be found and that your husband and family can help your father-in-law. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help to you.Ren",

            "answer": "Wow! Thanks for all the helpful feedback. I knew you all were awesome, but you've definitely proven it again.I am having trouble fitting all these pieces together into some sort of coherent whole, but Ren is right that he may have more than one thing going on or even an odd case of Parkinson's.Malfunctioning of the autonomic nervous system does seem to be a part of the problem.I'm not sure if he's confused or not--I was just trying to come up with a potential explanation for a situation my husband described. The driving problems seem to be vision-based. Even ordinary daylight is too bright for him and he gets blinded.I will ask about meds, too. My husband mentioned that his dad's on blood thinners, although it wasn't clear to me why. Due to their high-salt, low-fat diet Japanese are much more prone to the kind of stroke where you bleed uncontrollably rather than the kind where your arteries get blocked up so it's not clear to me why they would put him on those even if they thought he had a stroke.I am not sure how bad the diabetes angle is, but will ask about that and TIA's.They're all really frustrated that they're not getting much info from the medical establishment, a plight I think most of us can empathize with.I'll definitely let you know if something gets figured out.sho",

    "question": "This is probably not an MS question, but since you all know so much about things neurological, I thought you might have some ideas as to what this might be.My husband is in Japan right now visiting his family. My father-in-law is having what seem to be some neuro problems. After seeing him, my husband was reminded of some of the things I do, like the off-balance way I walk and thought maybe his dad has MS. I'm not so sure, but here's the story in case anyone has suggestions.He's a Japanese man in his late seventies whose problems apparently started last December. He and his wife were driving somewhere and at some point he said he couldn't drive anymore. His wife drove him home and by that point he had lost consciousness. An ambulance was called and he spent ten days in the hospital (Japanese hospitals are not so quick to discharge people as they are stateside).I don't think he has lost consciousness again, but since then he has some ongoing problems. It's not clear to me if they are stable or not. His eyes are extremely sensitive to light and he has to wear sunglasses a lot. Light also seems to cause him to have vision problems. At some point he had a minor car accident due to this. He doesn't drive now, but has trouble even being outside in a car. After riding in a car, he is unsteady when he gets out (this was one of the things that my husband says is very like what I do) and once didn't realize that he didn't have his shoes on (so I wonder if he has sensory problems, but perhaps he was just confused).He is also having heat sensitivity. Heat makes his symptoms worse and he cannot take a hot bath anymore (Japanese people love their hot baths). If he's rested and cooler, he walks more normally, but still slowly.He can't control his body well and his muscles don't move the way he wants. He sometimes falls, especially if he tries to get up quickly.He does have at least pre-diabetes and has recently had a polyp removed, but I don't think any other real health problems.Apparently, the family is not getting much info from the doctors and are somewhat at a loss.Any ideas what might be going on?sho",
