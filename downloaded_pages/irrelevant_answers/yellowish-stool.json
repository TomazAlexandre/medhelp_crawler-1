    "question": "Hi, I am\u00a0\u00a0logging on here in desperation. I have a yellow stool. Some times dark, some times light, but mostly medium. I can describe it as large loose and...well... it looks like there's an attempt at perforation. It's foul smelling. I pass a lot of wind. I have a feeling of discomfort in the right front lower area, slightly left of the hip bone if that makes any sense. No sensitivity when pressing there. And for the last two weeks, in certain sitting positions I have a vibration sensation. Have checked recently for hepatitus and bloo count is normal. Had colonoscopy and endoscopy three years ago - all good. Slightly fatty liver - and the doc says this is what is causing this. I am not so sure. I am concerned it may be something more serious",
