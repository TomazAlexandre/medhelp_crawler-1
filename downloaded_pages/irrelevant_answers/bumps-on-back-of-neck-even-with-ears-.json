    "question": "My husband is 41. We have been under a lot of stress. His dump truck broke down and we have been rebuilding it. He has noticed these pear shaped but dime size raised knots on the back of his neck in his hair line almost even with the middle of his ears an inch back in that lil soft spot area. When he stands up he gets dizzy! Have given him Advil and it did not help. The bumps are tender to the touch. Any help?",
