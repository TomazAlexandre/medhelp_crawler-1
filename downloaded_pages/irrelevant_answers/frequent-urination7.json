            "answer": "Thanks for the quick reply doctori completely avoid tea, coffee and alcohol , they worsen my condition alot.Another symptom is that i have pain in urethra\\penis while defecating. plus some burning feeling in urethra if i sit on moderately hot surface for longi havent tried bladder training . My diet is pretty healthy . No family history of prostate problems, though my grandparents have diabetesIn my adolcense years (from 13years to 16 years) i used to do self-abusing stuff due to lack of information. I used to squeeze my penis between legs repeatedly , feel the orgasm but wont let the seman out of penis. doing such stuff repeatedly has resulted into this condition for me over these years . Before i was 15 years old, i didnt have any urological disorders.Do people having prostatitis necessarily have frequent urination at night time also i.e they need to wake up from sleep?Please let me know if you need any more details.thanks",

            "answer": "i think u might be having diabetes,there is type 1 is an autoimmune disease that results in the permanent destruction of insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas.,which can be caused by heredity.The characteristic symptoms are excessive urine production (polyuria) due to high blood glucose levels, excessive thirst and increased fluid intake (polydipsia) attempting to compensate for increased urination.and type 2 caused by high amout of energy in a diet.so, because u say your healthy,u might find that it is family related.",

            "answer": "Hi,Not releasing the semen on orgasm can cause a reflux of the semen into the prostate and/ or the epididymis.This has been known to irritate the affected structures and can result in inflammation and infection.Pain in the penis during defecation could be a sign of an inflamed prostate as the nerve supply to the prostate and tip of the penis are by the same nerve.Diabetes is a possibility at any age, especially with a family history of diabetes. A simple blood sugar test would identify whether you have diabetes or not. However, diabetes would have also been characterized by excessive thirst and night-time urination also.A drug called tamsulosin has been quite effective in reducing frequent urination symptoms due to prostatitis.You can start taking tamsulosin after discussion with your urologist and check for an improvement in your symptoms.Tea is a diuretic and will increase frequency of urination.Caffeine and alcohol have been known to further irritate the prostate.Sitting on well-padded surfaces has been known to help during the healing of prostatitis.Regards",

            "answer": "Hi Vaibhav,The ingredients of the supplement seem ok, except for the vitamin C.Vitamin C supplements may cause irritation to the prostate especially if it has already been inflammed.Natural sources of vitamin C would help more.Also Saw Palmetto is an over-the-counter agent that has been used in prostatitis with variable results.I am also wondering about the possibility that you may have overactive bladder syndrome or interstitial cystitis, but hoping to see you respond better just with dietary and lifestyle changes.Do start the supplement, but with caution so as to stop immediately if you notice any worsening of symptoms.Do keep us posted on how you are faring.Regards",

    "question": "I am a 22 years old male from india. I am suffering from frequent (day time) urination (around 12 times in daytime only, don't wake up from sleep to urinate ) for the last 6 years. I generally have to urinate in small amounts,I feel that I am emptying my bladder everytime . My urine flow also is normal, I take little time to start urinating as the amount of urine is not much. there is no urinary leakage , i feel my pelvic floor muscles are strong enough.Urine test didn't show any infection. Also the ultrasound for urinary tract showed everything normal (such as prostate size, amount of post-void urine in bladder etc) . I have consumed drugs like doxycyclin and detrol, but all these don't seem to help rather worsen me physically with side effects. Could it be that I have chronic nonbacterial prostatitis? How could my condition be diagnosed? I feel really depressed due to this and my social life has also suffered a lot as I don't go out much due to this.thanks",
