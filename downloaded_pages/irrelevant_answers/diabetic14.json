            "answer": "Hi,in addition to medication, you need to work hard on lifestyle with appropriate diet and exercise.The best way to see what works is frequent testing, after each meal to see which foods increase your blood sugar above target and which do not.You may also have Type I (adult onset).\u00a0\u00a0In this case oral meds often don't work and insulin is needed.Most important is you work closely with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0High blood sugars (actually recent research has shown that anything above 140) cause damage and it is critical that you can manage your blood sugar well.Educate yourself.\u00a0\u00a0Medication is not enough to manage this.\u00a0\u00a0You need all: lifestyle (diet, exercise, weight management), medication, and medical supervision/support.",

Stomach will itself go in(contract in). The breathing in(through the nose) will happen automatically. Establish a rhythm and do for 15 to 30 minutes twice a day.Children under 15 years \u2013 do 10 to 15 minutes twice a day.Not for pregnant women. Seriously ill people do it gently.Anulom Vilom \u2013Close your right nostril with thumb and deep breath-in through left nostrilthen \u2013 close left nostril with two fingers and breath-out through right nostrilthen -keeping the left nostril closed deep breath-in through right nostrilthen - close your right nostril with thumb and breath-out through left nostril.This is one cycle of anulom vilom.Repeat this cycle for 15 to 30 minutes twice a day.Children under 15 years -\u00a0\u00a0do 10 to 15 minutes twice a day.You can do this before breakfast/lunch/dinner or before bedtime or in bed.Remember to take deep long breaths into the lungs.You can do this while sitting on floor or chair or lying in bed.Also everyday, press the centre point of the palm of both your\u00a0\u00a0hands 40 times with the thumb and press the tips of all fingers 40 times each.To stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin: mandukasan - kneel down(with feet pointing inwards,and sit on the ankles/heels, Vajrasan position), breathe in and breathe out completely and hold your breath, pull the stomach in, press both your\u00a0\u00a0hands on stomach, bend forward as much as possible keeping the head straight, hold for 5 to 15 seconds and come back up while breathing in.

            "answer": "Ok, this is about the 100th time this post has appeared and I don't know what \"hava's\" motivation is, but guys, there are not any breathing exercises that will cure diabetes! People that are new to diabetes are very vulnerable and subject to believe this sort of nonsense and that is not what they need. If her/his motivations are honest and he/she benefits from breathing exercises...great. It might also relieve stress which can make blood sugar higher.\u00a0\u00a0But people, do NOT believe this is a cure for diabetes. No one thing will keep blood sugar under control and there IS no cure yet. For Type 2 diabetes the key is a combination of exercise, controlling carb intake and oral meds or insulin if recommended by your doctor.If you are newly diagnosed diabetic or pre diabetic, please talk with your doctor or better yet a diabetic educator to figure what combination of things will work for you. Get a test meter and test your blood sugar to see how different foods affect you. Go to other websites where there are people who have been successfully managing diabetes for man years and listen to what works for them, recognizing that we are all different.",

            "answer": "Yog Pranayam is the breathing exercises and Yog asanas is the physical postures and movement, and pressure points is - pressing different points on hands and feet.It is a holistic approach to make the systems in the body to work efficiently, and build up the immune system.It is good that you have started Yog, and you will start to notice benefits(not side effects) when you start doing kapalbhati and anulom vilom for more than 15 minutes(upto 30 minutes).I will try to make this general as other people are also following this.Make a list of all your minor,major,occasional(digestive,physical,neuro etc) symptoms.Keep a record of your medical details - weight,blood pressure, blood test results etc.Keep doing the pranayam and asanas and check your list of symptoms and medical measurements, to see what has improved over weeks and months (or after a blood test).This record will help when you try to tell someone else.There will be some benefits which you never thought about.I would like people to experience the benefits and come back to report on this thread(even after weeks and months), so others may benefit.I can say that you will see improvements in sleep,digestive system and general efficiency to start off and the rest is for you to observe and tell others.It will be very satisfying to see that you can help the body yourself.The small print is, you have to do Yog once a day for life(after you have no symptoms), to maintain health and quality of life.Continue any medication you are taking and review at next appointment with health professional.Do it and reap the benefits.I respect other views expressed, as it is normal, when the knowledge has not spread widely.",
