When I first found out I had it, I asked my OB doctor if she would induce me. She said the only time they like to induce in that situation is if a diet doesn't help blood sugar numbers, and you need insulin to control it. Which is obviously the case for me. I have a doctors appointment tomorrow, and plan on asking about induction again.",

After seeing the ultrasound she will determine a day for me to get induced!",

            "answer": "I'm almost 34 weeks now. And the non stress tests and ultrasounds are normal. The stress tests are to monitor the baby's heart rate and the ultrasounds are to keep better track of the baby's development. When you have gestational diabetes, the baby runs a higher chance of weighing over 9lbs, so they monitor it closely. I'm not sure what your doctor will do since you are on metformin. I haven't actually heard too much about that medication. All OB doctors are different, but mine told me that if any medication was needed to control blood sugar levels, instead of a diet just helping, then she would induce. So with that being said, my doctor would probably still choose to induce if I had been on metformin instead of insulin as well. You may just want to talk to your OB doctor about induction. It never hurts to ask!! And I actually was wanting to be induced. I've been trying to be patient, because I want my daughter to be as healthy as possible, but I'm soooo ready to meet her! So as long as my doctor thinks she is healthy and can survive being born early, then I will be all for it! :)",
