            "answer": "Hi,Cerebral aneurysms can be congenital or can develop later on life as a result of high BP or atherosclerosis (blockade of arteries by plaque). Since your previous MRI has been normal and you do not suffer from conditions like high BP, the chances of aneurysm is very unlikely.As of now your symptoms seem to be due to migraine and acute anxiety. I would suggest you to use the migraine tracker and try and identify a trigger for your migraines.Hope this helps!",

            "answer": "Thank you for your comment I am relieved slightly. However I still feel ill, headache, dizzyness and vertigo but my GP still believes it to be migraine.I have heard brain injury symptoms can occur for around ten days could this be the case with me? Or how does my condition differ from a brain haemorrhage attack?",

            "answer": "Hi,The symptoms of brain hemorrhage or stroke are quite similar to migraine. The difference lies in the onset of symptoms. In migraine the onset of symptoms is slow and insidious while in stroke these symptoms occur acutely.Stroke patients also have one or more risk factors for stroke like high BP, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, smoking and chronic alcoholism and stress.I would suggest you to get another evaluation done by your neurologist and keep us posted.",

    "question": "I have been suffering from migraines for two years and last year I was rushed to hospital after having a seziure at home. A neurologist suggeste a MRI and CT scan both came back normal (this was 18th months ago could an aneurysum form in that time?). I have suffered with migraine ever since but reecently the seerity has increased. I have been told to exercise (although I am a fit individual 23 years of age uni student, 10 stone 7lbs, blood pressure 110/70) by my GP but after exercising my headache became worse. The pain continuously moves around my head it is either pounding or ull in nature, my right pupil is larger than my left (although this has been the case for the past few months), I have eye pain, facial pain, constant nausea and vertigo and severe back and neck pain. I'm worried it could be something more serious than a migraine ?Please Please help. Kind Regards",
