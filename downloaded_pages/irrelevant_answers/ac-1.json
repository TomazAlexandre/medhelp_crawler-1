            "answer": "I wonder as well about your treatment. I would assume you are on insulin? Are you on a basal/bolus regimen? (Long-acting once or twice a day plus fast-acting before meals?). This is the standard of care as well as using an Insulin: Carb ratio to determine your insulin dose based on what you are actually eating, not a set dose or a sliding scale. You need to work to lower your carbs, and find your correct doses of insulin because obviously your diabetes is way out of control. A blood sugar of 445 if sustained on a regular basis is dangerous and will lead to extensive complications. (And I'm sure you feel terrible!)If you are not working with an endocrinologist, do so right away as regular docs don't have the experience. Get the book Using Insulin by John Walsh and if you want send me a private message and I will give you the names of a couple websites with regular posts from diabetics successfully managing their diabetes (and those who are struggling too) and you will get a lot of support and information.",
