It's a mild dose of bc. Try to give yourself 3 months to regulate it in your body. Consult your doctor if you have serious side affects. Are you taking any other meds for your pcos? I'm also on Metformin for weight issues. I started my journey in September 2008 at 333lbs and I am now at 272lbs.",

            "answer": "Hello ladies,I am new to this forum. I was diagnosed with PCOS at the age of 19. I'll be 33 next month. I've suffered from severe acne, cysts, abnormal periods and major mood swings. I've had 3 laproscopies and I've been on Yasmin for over 8 years. I have to say, of the 5 or 6 different bc pills I've taken, I found Yasmin to be the best. It really curbed my acne a great deal. Also, I had no cysts. On some of the other bc pills, I still developed cystic ovaries. I was placed on Yasmin when I lived in NY by a very well renowned RE who said that Yasmin was one of the best and most highly recommended for treating PCOS symptoms.",

            "answer": "Your right. Yasmin is mostly given to those who suffer from PCOS because it works best with our bodies. Although some ladies have found Yasmin not helpful to them. To me it's a lower dose of bc, which helps to lessen side affects such as breakthrough bleeding.",
