            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you have missed your periods then check for pregnancy. Blood pregnancy tests or urine pregnancy tests can be done. If you are yet to get periods, then wait for the date to pass and take test if you miss periods.Constipation can cause nausea and the gas can cause uterus to tilt. Chronic constipation can be due to diet poor in roughage or fiber, dehydration, diabetes, hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc. It can also be due to milk allergy and other food allergies.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

    "question": "I hope this is okay to post here. I do not know what is going on with my body. I was being told by someone that i am having a problem with not ovulating as I should. I thought the symptoms I am having were pregnancy related symptoms I have been having an extreme constipation, bad nausea, but my cervix I am told is in the wrong position. my cervix is far back and it is i'm assuming it is soft. During intercourse the last few times I have been having funny discharge which is definately not infectious, I went to the doctor about the same problem before and she said it was normal. I do not know what is going on with me at all. Is there something I can do to at least get my body back on track>",
