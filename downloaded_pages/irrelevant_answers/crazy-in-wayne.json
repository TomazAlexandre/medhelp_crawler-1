            "answer": "Lori,It sounds like you are having panic attacks (brief intense periods of anxiety) and have been evaluated for physical conditions that can present similarly.\u00a0\u00a0If physical illness such as thyroid disorders, diabetes mellitus and cardiac conditions have been ruled out then it is very possible that this is panic\u00a0\u00a0disorder.Xanax has been somewhat helpful to you however, there are other medications such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(Zoloft, Paxil,Prozac, Celexa, and Luvox) which can prevent attacks from occurring. Certain types of psychotherapy, specifically CBT(cognitive behavioral therapy) can also be helpful.I recommend that you discuss these issues further with your medical doctor and if he feels there is no physical condition present, then a referal for psychiatric evaluation could be helpful. Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0Keep in mind that the intent of this forum is for general educational purposes only.Sincerely,HFHS MD-JMKeywords: Panic attacks/disorder, anxiety",

    "question": "I have had a disorder of some type for about 2 years now.\u00a0\u00a0I have seen several doctors and they tell me it is anxiety but nothing is helping. I know take Xanax that does seem to calm me some but not fully.\u00a0\u00a0Six (6) months after my baby was born, I was sitting at my desk at work and started shaking all over, couldn't catch my breath and felt like I was choking. It last about 10-15 minutes and I was distraught for days over this.\u00a0\u00a0Feeling like it could happen again anytime.\u00a0\u00a0I no longer can stand to be alone or to drive a vehicle without an adult being in the car.\u00a0\u00a0I have attempted several times to try to be alone but I just have an attack every time.\u00a0\u00a0I have always considered myself to be very independant and I can't stand this.\u00a0\u00a0I also developed gestational diabetes during my pregnancy; could that have anything to do with it? Could it be my thyroid?\u00a0\u00a0Blood tests have been done and everything came back OK.\u00a0\u00a0I also loose weight during pregnancy only to gain it back plus more after I deliver.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I think maybe it's not anxiety and something hormonal. Is that possible?",
