            "answer": "Thanks for getting back to me on this. I spoke to some of the doctors ( who happen to be my classmates) They all agree that the reading is not of a diabetic person. Also I had done some random Plasma glucose test readings were 103 and 116.On the 29th of sept did a fasting blood glucose ,reading was 99 ( on 8 hour fasting). Being confused repeated the test on 30th but with 12 hour fasting it the reading was 107.(all test done at the same lab).Now I am monitoring my blood sugar using glucometer getting normal readings. Occassionaly when i am tense and under stress getting readings which are above 140. Will keep you posted.",

            "answer": "Helloa truely normal HBA1c will be < 5.0.\u00a0\u00a0A reading of 6.1 means that your average blood sugars (over the past 3 months) have been too high.\u00a0\u00a0Considering that the cut off for a diagnosis is 7.0 you are not yet considered diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0However, for health it is necessary to intervene now to perhaps prevent a future diagnosis.Fasting blood sugars should ideally be < 95 (and truely normal is the low to mid 80s).\u00a0\u00a0Your reported fasting levels would make you 'prediabetic'.To reverse this regular physical activity (ideally daily at least 30 minutes, more if possible).\u00a0\u00a0Lose weight if overweight, avoid and portion control on carbs and sweets.\u00a0\u00a0A low carb diet is most effective for many.Keep monitoring and repeat A1C at least every 3 - 6 months to see your progress.",
