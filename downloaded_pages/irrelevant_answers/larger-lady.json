            "answer": "I also got pregnant losing weight, I know quite a few plus size women that have gotten pregnant and had no problems, of course do everything any other woman would do, don't lift anything strenuous. Walk, do what you can to exercise, (it can be harddd to force yourself to, I'm 17 weeks and still don't like to!) and eat healthy! The only concern MIGHT be blood pressure or gestational diabetes towards the 2nd and 3rd trimester, but as long as you're exercising and eating a healthy diet, you'll be fine, congratulations!!! :)",
