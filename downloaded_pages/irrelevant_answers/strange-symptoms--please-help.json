            "answer": "Hello,Without examination confirmation of a diagnosis is tough but frequent urination(polyuria) can be due to diabetes mellitus.Other possibilities are diabetes insipidus,glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis(inflammation of the kidneys),urinary tract infection,hypercalcemia,hypokalemia(low potassium),hyperthyroidism,hyperparathyroidism,diuretic drugs and benign hyperplasia of the prostate(in males).In my opinion, investigations like kidney functions, blood sugar levels, ultrasound lower abdomen ,intravenous pyelography ,prostate specific antigen blood test,thyroid function tests and cystoscopy may be needed to confirm a diagnosis.I sincerely advise you to consult a urologist or nephrologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "i am a 35 yr old female.\u00a0\u00a0last november i had a check up with a blood panel done and a gynecologic exam and all was normal.\u00a0\u00a0about 3 or 4 times per year i get frequent urination but with absolutely no burning or pain.\u00a0\u00a0i will just have a constant need to urinate and sometimes a little comes out and sometimes a lot.\u00a0\u00a0anyhow, it always subsides on it's own.\u00a0\u00a0about a week ago i developed a swollen gland behind my ear and about a day later the frequent urination started.\u00a0\u00a0i bought an over the counter urinary tract infection tester and it game back negative for leukocites and slightly positive (very slightly) for nitrites.\u00a0\u00a0i had some 500 mg cipro from a respiratory infection that i had last winter.\u00a0\u00a0i called my pharmacist and she said that cipro is used for urinary infections.\u00a0\u00a0she said the dose is often 2 pills twice daily for 3 days.\u00a0\u00a0i have just enough so i started taking them and my frequent urination stopped after the second pill.\u00a0\u00a0the swollen gland had already disappeared that morning.\u00a0\u00a0i have been checking my temperature and it has been running between 98.8 and 99 for the last 2 days.\u00a0\u00a03 days ago it was 99.3 (all checked in the evening around 7:00 pm).\u00a0\u00a0would these numbers be a fever?\u00a0\u00a0i tend to run just below 98.6 but maybe i'm higher because i just passed ovulation?\u00a0\u00a0can you have a urinary tract infection with no burning?\u00a0\u00a0the only symptoms were frequent urination and very slight pressure in my bladder area.\u00a0\u00a0i thought you would have to have some burning or pain.",
