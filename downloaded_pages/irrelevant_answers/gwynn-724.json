            "answer": "My daughter had a congenital malformation of one of her kidneys. We did not know about it whilst she was growing up but she was weakened and suffered from feeling nausea often but never sick.. She often succumbed to other infections.\u00a0\u00a0Finally at the age of 25 yrs she had severe kidney infection and then after all the tests saw that it was chronically infected.\u00a0\u00a0I am glad you are going to the Nephrologist\u00a0\u00a0and hope that they give you the correct tests to sort out that kidney of yours. My daughter was given antibiotics but it was then too many years of infection and they had to remove it in the end.\u00a0\u00a0So I hope\u00a0\u00a0that you will make them very aware of your nausea and weakness and get it sorted out.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I am sorry to hear that you are suffering so much. Yes, kidney disease, involvement of lungs and heart can together precipitate the symptoms and hence it is important to assess whether all is fine by kidney function, pulmonary function tests, EKG, ECHO and further tests for heart. If you have headaches and hot flashes and lightheadedness with a feeling of passing out, you could be having either polycystic ovarian disease or GERD with or without H pylori infection. These are the two conditions to be ruled out first. Other conditions to be strongly ruled out in your case could be cervical spinal nerve compression, Meniere\u2019s disease of the ear, wax in the ear, infection of the middle or inner ear, benign positional vertigo and benign intracranial hypertension. Hence it is important to consult an ENT specialist and a neurologist too. At times back and neck problems may persist for years before they really start giving trouble. Chances of TMJ too should be looked into. Other causes are anemia, hypoglycemia or low sugar and some endocrine problems, such as an underactive thyroid (called hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (called hyperthyroidism), adrenal insufficiency (called Addison's disease),\u00a0\u00a0and in some cases, diabetes, may lead to hypotension and hence lightheadedness and an off balance feeling. It can also be an anxiety and panic attack. It is really difficult to comment on the net. I suggest you consult your PCP to run the basic investigations and get an insight into what could be the cause. Depending on clinical examination and tests, your PCP can refer you to the appropriate specialist.Hope this helps. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
