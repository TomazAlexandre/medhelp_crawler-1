            "answer": "Geno 2 and 3 have a very high success rate (80%+)when compared to geno 1. The reason they recommend treatment for them without a biopsy is that a biopsy is used to determine the treatment decision and if you have already decided or the doctor recommends you treat based on your genotype then a biopsy ( and the risk of a biopsy)can be avoided or is not necessary to determine if you need to treat right away.It has nothing to do with conspiracy theories or anything else, it is the LEAST invasive approach. This is the ONLY known treatment that can possibly eradicate the virus.Why risk a biopsy if you are already going to treat is the thinking.",

            "answer": "This article doesn't mention Diabetes, but it should as diabetes is also an extra hepatic manifestation. So is Liver cancer.If you are asymptomatic with Hep C that is great HOWEVER you are still at a substantially increased risk for OTHER diseases and disorders. So rather than HCV killing you early, you very well could die of a hepatitis C RELATED disease that you developed due to your Hepatitis C positive status.This is why a lack of symptoms of HCV can be so very DANGEROUS. Tis is a NONLINEAR disease, you can be perfectly fine for decades and then have it rapidly progress, this is why it is very important to monitor your disease properly if you do deide not to treat your disease. Don't be lulled into a sense of complacency by a lack of liver related symptoms. Keep in mind VIRUSES CAUSE CANCER. This is why being HCV positive increases your chances of having various cancers and one in particular, non Hodgkins lymphoma. This is not a liver disease! It is an immune system disease, a blood disease.Treating PRIOR to having any damage from the disease is far and away the best chance you have at clearing it and lowering your risks for consequences of being HCV positive.",

    "question": "this is a continuation of a thread i started a while ago...the answers to this question sure as hell confirmed my thoughts that the docs are in cahoots with the drug companies... finding out a patient has hep c and then right away prescribing a nasty cocktail of danger drugs that cost a fortune and prob wont work anyway... with no biop there is NO WAY of knowing how bad off your liver is ... isnt it true that most of us with this, if we eat healthy, take care of our bodies, and stay away from certain LIQUIDS, will probably die of something else a long long long time from now???i have given up on doctors and traditional medicine, at least here in the US ...",
