    "question": "The fingertip of a middle finger on my left hand is tingling for about 30 minies after every shower I take.It started 4 months ago and happens consistently after every shower.I shower twice a day, morning and night and it happens both times.I tried to use slightly different water temperatures, change soaps but it didn't help.The tingling starts after a few minutes in the shower and continues about 30 minutes after the shower.The only thing that seems to eliminate it is covering the fingertip with finger sleeve during the showers.I saw my doctor and did a lot of different blood tests and carpal tunnel tests which all came back ok.Anyone has an idea what it could be and how to treat it?",
