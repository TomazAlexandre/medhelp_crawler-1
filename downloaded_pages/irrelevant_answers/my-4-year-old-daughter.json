            "answer": "I am in NO WAY an expert, but have you looked into psychological reasons? Many children wet the bed, BUT, uncontrollable and constant wetting (and during the daytime) may be some serious signs of some form of abuse. My step-daughter is 11 and JUST STOPPED wetting the bed because her bio-father was a child molester.But it doesn't necessarily have to be sexual. I was raised by hippies. I'm a male but I had EXTREMELY long hair. I was \"pretty\" as a boy. Because of this, the kids at school made fun of me and kicked me out of the boy's bathroom, saying that I was a girl and had to use the girl's bathroom. Due to my anxiety of being teased and thrown out of the bathroom, I wet my pants at school every day during the second grade.Those are just two examples of psychological reasons why someone may not have control of their bladder. I know your daughter isn't in second grade, and she's probably not dealing with the teasing, but she could be the victim of some other form of abuse. At the very least, look into it.If it's not physical abuse or emotional abuse, then there's a good possibility that she's growing faster than her bladder. This actually happens. So she's consuming a normal amount of food and water, but her bladder is too small to hold all the fluid, and she has frequent urination which can lead to accidents. They have a pill for this, but I don't remember what it's called.Hope this helps. And remember, take all responses with a grain of salt. This is, afterall, the internet.:)",

            "answer": "Hi,In view of the symptoms of frequent urination which you have mentioned, I\u2019ll suggest consulting a physician for the same getting your daughter further evaluated for the same like getting her blood sugar done to rule out diabetes, an ultrasound to rule out a stone in the urinary bladder which can present as frequent urination, a urine analysis to see the specific gravity as there\u2019s an entity called diabetes inspidus in which the patients pass a very dilute urine and kidney function tests to ensure the kidneys are functioning properly. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",

    "question": "Hello my 4 year old little girl is constantly having accidents throughout the day in regards to her urine. She does not drink excessive amounts of liquid, yet she needs to urinate about 5-6 times a day, and 3-4 of those times end up being accidents. She has consistantly been this way since potty training ended. She does not have a UTI. I don't know how to help her, she still wears a pull up at night. She has gotten to the point of asking me for help with it, and just yesterday she asked me to call the doctor because she doesn't know why she has to go \"pee pee\" so much, please help!!",
