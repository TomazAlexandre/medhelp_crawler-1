I'm also exercising, mostly walking the dog, medium weight lifting, and some light core work (great for when going into labor so I've heard). As long as your doctor is okay with you losing healthy weight you should be okay.",

Walking 5 miles a day is amazing just stay hydrated. And when it comes to eating don't under eat. Just eat healthier. Lots of fruits and veggies, good proteins and a lot less carbs.Good luck I hope you make your goal but remember even if you don't making your body healthier for you and the baby is still a great accomplishment.",

Just focus on eating healthy portions and when hungry.",

This is my second pregnancy I was overweight when I got pregnant this time I weighed about 165-170 beginning now I weigh 184 and I'm 27 weeks I eat healthy and walk occasionally but ive had a lot of complications this pregnancy and don't feel like its worth the risk so I'll focus on it after baby!

When I was about 19 weeks I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I have had to completely change the way I eat. Before I started the diet I gained back about 7 pounds. Since I started I've lost 3 more. I'm 22 weeks now and finally have my sugars in check but my doctor and nutrionist said I will continue to lose weight and that because of the diabetes they will be monitoring the baby more closely. I'm not trying to lose weight just doing what I have to to keep the diabetes under control but if I could be around 200 by the time she's born I wouldn't object!! I would just check with your doctor or maybe put yourself on a gd diet lol good luck!",
