            "answer": "Julie,Neurological disorders such as Multiple sclerosis, Huntingtons disease, and Parkisons disorder all have related psychological manifestations associated with them such as depression and mood instability.\u00a0\u00a0Psychological disorders can often mimic neurolgical disorders and vice-versa but usually can be differentiated by a careful neurologicaland psychiatric assement.Somatization is the process that results in the unconscious/unintentional production of somatic/physical symptoms that represent psychological conflicts(depression, anxiety).\u00a0\u00a0Example, people often experience nausea or diarrhea when they feel anxious.I suggest that you work with your neurologist and psychatrist to sort these issues out.\u00a0\u00a0A somatoform disorder should be considered.\u00a0\u00a0Keep in mind that this information is intended for general educational purposes only.\u00a0\u00a0Consult your personal physician for specific health concerns.\u00a0\u00a0You may find it helpful to search this forums archives using somatoform disorder as a keyword.Sincerely,HFHS MD-JMKeywords: Somatization, somatoform disoreder",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for the reply. I do have an appointment with a psychiatrist on the 22nd. Dr. Malone.I would much rather be dealing with somatization than Huntington's! Especially where my children are concerned.I am hoping my Huntington's test is back this week.I will post to let you know.In the mean time, Thank you very much for the advice. I like going to my appointments at least having an idea what questions to ask.Sincerely,Julie",

    "question": "I have been ill for over 10 years. I had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 1989. Last year I was told I don't have it.I have major depression. I have tried many anti depressant medications with severe side affects or allergic reaction to them all. ( Zoloft made me dissociate, Paxil make me hypomanic and many of them cause my bowels and bladder to stop completely. Last year I had septicemia ( staph) from being impacted for so long. Doc didn't believe me when I said I could\u00a0\u00a0not go.Anyway, I have neurological problems, I don't tolerate meds well at all, ( I have dystonic reaction to many of them. Even Ditropan caused dystonia)This past year I have developed chorea -form movement disorder.I saw a movement disorder specialist. I am waiting for results of a Huntington's disease test.I am curious though. I know that underlying medical conditions can cause psychiatric problems ( Like diabetes can, and Huntington's) Can a Chemical imbalance cause physical symptoms that would mimic a neurological disease?I have had so many things ruled out. I am kind of hoping that it is a psychosomething and not Huntington's.",
