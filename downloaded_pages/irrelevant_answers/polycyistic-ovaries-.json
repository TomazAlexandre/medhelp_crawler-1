            "answer": "Hi,Losing weight is indeed a big problem with many women. Firstly you need to check that your hormone levels are normal. Also rule out other issues like diabetes and high cholesterol. Weight loss can be achieved by a combination of diet control or dietary modification and exercise. You should eat a diet rich in fibre and eat whole grains, fruits and vegetables. You can consult a dietician to prepare a diet chart according to your food habits, in such a way that nutrition is not compromised. Exercise should be such that is as per your liking so that the chances of sticking to the exercise regime are greater. Exercise should be done daily for 30 to 60 minutes. Aerobic exercises will facilitate fat loss better.Hope this helps.",
