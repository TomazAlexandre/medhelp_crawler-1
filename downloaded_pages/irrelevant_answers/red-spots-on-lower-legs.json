            "answer": "HiI do understand your concern. Looking at the images, this appears to be a dermatitic skin condition. As you are still young and have no associated disease conditions, a dermatitic skin condition such as irritant dermatitis is most likely here. I suggest that you also have a complete blood count done to have your platelet count assessed. This will be able to help rule out any acute infection or even a bleeding problem. A baseline duplex scan of the lower extremities will be able to help after a complete physical examination by your physician. Examination of your peripheral pulses may be necessary.Is there any associated pain with prolonged standing?Are there varicosities found in the area?",

            "answer": "HiThanks for your reply.That was really helpful. I think you got it right. As I am hyper sensitive to cold (that's what I think). Since last two years I have had this problem that whenever I am exposed to even a\u00a0\u00a0little bit cooler temperature, I develop these clot looking\u00a0\u00a0scars on all my extremities. So I have had these scars for over two years. they seen to fade little bit in sun.Lately I have also had a little swelling in my feet which i guess could be due to some blood related problem. I guess i should go to a physician. As for pain with prolonged standing, it does exist these days as my feet have started to swell. My feet also swell after walking briskly, this never happened before.What do you think and suggest?Thanks for your time and any input will be appreciated.",

    "question": "HiI have developed red tiny spots in abundance on both my lower legs. They developed gradually and have been there consistently. There is no itching or any other problem with them. Recently my feet started swelling occasionally. I did a diabetes test which came negative.About me: I am a 26 year old Indian girl. I weigh 105 pounds and my height is 5.3'. I just need an opinion. My father-in-law who is a general practitioner in India told me that it could be an allergy. I have been taking anti allergic for about 7 days now but nothing is happening.",
