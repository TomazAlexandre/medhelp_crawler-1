    "question": "I am a 34 year old male who in the past 7 or 8 years has noticed my penis head has become completely numb. No feeling at all. I have a normal sex life and masturbate, I think, as normal as everyone. Note-sex 3times a week and masturbate maybe once a day out of 5. I had seen a doctor years back and he gave me samples of vigra. Which made it real sensitive, but had a headache and not to mention didnt solve my problem. I can get erect and stay that way. But no feeling. My doctor also sent me to a neorologist and all was fine. I have seen things online that say not enough sleep or hernia could cause that. Or I have might have shut down a blood vessel somehow.I have noticed on occasion my penis is dry, during masturbation or afterwards. I have even tried to take a rest from it all and go a few weeks with nothing and see if that helps. No difference. Pretty much the only way I can *** is through masturbating while watching porn or really concentrate during sex.\u00a0\u00a0Please help.",
