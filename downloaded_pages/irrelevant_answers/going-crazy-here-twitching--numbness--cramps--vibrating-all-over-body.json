            "answer": "Well, since you have diabetes, obviously your regular doc needs to draw blood and doublecheck your sugars, also check your vitamin and mineral levels, since you yourself say your nutrients may not be up to par.\u00a0\u00a0You said you started a diet to control diabetes (I think that's what you meant) about the time all this started and since you have digestive issues, something about that diet does not agree with you.\u00a0\u00a0Lack of proper nutrients and indigestion can make you feel really whoozy and dizzy, which is similar to your sense of unreality and falling whilst in bed.I think your blood pressure medicine has got to be adjusted or changed, too.\u00a0\u00a0This is because the EKG showed some problems, even tho the angiogram was okay.\u00a0\u00a0If your pressure is off, then that is what will cause those feelings of panic.If you happen to be on an antidepressant, SSRIs can cause those shocky feelings in the body and head... also missing a dose or stopping those drugs can cause zaps.\u00a0\u00a0So, have your doc review all your prescribed meds and their side effects, and maybe switch you to other kinds of medicines, depending on which drugs might be bothering you.The lumbosacral spine disk herniations are what's causing all your leg sensations and back pain.\u00a0\u00a0If you do not wish to do surgery, you can wear a back brace from the pharmacy when you're up and about, and you can take some very good drugs that will kill the pain, to include not only opiates, but also especially the anti-seizure type nerve drugs.\u00a0\u00a0I have piercing and hateful lower back pain, and only thing that helps it is Lyrica and Neurontin, which are cousins, but Lyrica is expensive.\u00a0\u00a0Side effects are kind of wild, you lose balance and feel dizzy and sometimes sleepy, so timing and amount of dose are crucial... they also have to be upped in dose in the first few months until you reach a tolerance and plateau of comfort.Could be your TMJ is how come you feel pain in your head and jaw.\u00a0\u00a0It's also quite possible that the joint is so out of control, that it's affecting your inner ear where the balance mechanism is, so thus your vertigo.\u00a0\u00a0You can go to an ear nose throat (ENT) man, and have him check our your TMJ and also discuss medicines for vertigo.To recap, you've got several separate issues that are driving you nuts:\u00a0\u00a0You're feeling lots of anxiety from your blood pressure medicine being inadequate, you're in pain from your goofed-up spine, your nutrients and diet are no good, plus your diabeties sugars may be off, and could be some other medications you take are affecting your sense of well-being.\u00a0\u00a0I remember I got really sick with a bunch of stuff one time, and took me quite a while to get everything straight.\u00a0\u00a0I thought I had some major disease, but it was just a collection of relatively minor stuff (except my busted up back was major) that all conspired to pretty much wreck my life for a while there.Set up some doc appointments, perhaps follow the little post I have here as to what all they should be doing to help you, and in the meantime, here's a few suggestions to help you feel better right now:1.\u00a0\u00a0Panic can be relieved by doing deep breathing techniques.\u00a0\u00a0Breathe in really deep, blow it out, breathe normal a couple breaths, repeat ten times.\u00a0\u00a0This will slow down the heart and thus knock back anxiety.2.\u00a0\u00a0Forget the diet thing, except for the usual diabetic concerns, and try eating some of this stuff:\u00a0\u00a0Whole grain bread or oat cereal, brocholli is a miracle food, if you can eat blueberries as a snack, drink some Acidophilus milk or Activia yogurt for a couple weeks, eggs are also a miracle food, salads, and just a little bit of orange juice or an orange depending on your diabetic needs.3.\u00a0\u00a0You need to exercise regularly and you need to drink at least five glasses of water daily as a habit.Hope you get better soon.\u00a0\u00a0Probably the most important things to do straight away is your blood pressure medicine needs adjusting (get a squeeze-in emergency appointment), then you have got to get adequate pain relief drugs going.\u00a0\u00a0Oh, one more thing, when your back is really hurting, lay down flat on the floor and scoot up close to a chair and lay your legs in the seat, let your arms drop to the side.\u00a0\u00a0This takes ALL the pressure off your back and helps you feel better for a few hours.\u00a0\u00a0Keep us posted!",

            "answer": "fear of ALS or MS is killing me..Like i say,at the EMG/NCS\u00a0\u00a0refused to tell me anything till the other Dr calles me, they had a lot of trouble getting any results with my right leg, and the one dr doing the test said \"This cant be right\" and i said \"Is it me or the machine\" She told me, \"It could be booth\" My HART DROPPED! Since then i have been in a state of unreal fear. Im going CRAZY here.The nuro Doc did tell me i had not out ward signs of any disorder, all kinds of motor tests were 100% ok.

            "answer": "Doesn't matter what your \"diagnosis\" is.\u00a0\u00a0Anytime your lower back is goofed up, you're gonna feel it in your legs, and if you're like me, the pain is fierce.\u00a0\u00a0SOMEbody, like a regular family doctor, ought to give you SOMEthing for the pain.\u00a0\u00a0And no need to wait around for those folks to figure you out.\u00a0\u00a0The same family doc can draw blood and check your blood pressure meds, which is absolutely crucial at the moment, and all the other labwork I mentioned.\u00a0\u00a0I forgot to mention in my last post, but your blood pressure can give you headaches.\u00a0\u00a0Now, if you don't have a regular family doc, just go down to the county health department as a walk-in, you can be seen the same day for what ails you, and maybe get some treatment going, altho they may be reluctant to give you opiates, but they will give you Lyrica, kills low back pain like nobody's business, lots of times they'll have samples.\u00a0\u00a0Just be sure to tell them and maybe produce papers that say you got that disk problem in your lumbosacral spine.\u00a0\u00a0GG",

            "answer": "I might add that whomever is giving you your blood pressure meds, just go to him, he's really the one you need to see THE MOST, and while you're there, ask him about Lyrica samples, just see if something like that helps you, and later you can pursue a doc about getting long-term prescription for that.\u00a0\u00a0Just go to your BP doc for the labs, too, on your sugars and vitamin and electrolyte numbers.\u00a0\u00a0GG",
