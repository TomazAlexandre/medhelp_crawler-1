            "answer": "\"my doctor uped my medication from 50 mg metformin 2Xday to 1 and 1/2 gram 2Xday( 3 times my regular dose)\"You have quoted your dosages incorrectly. In the USA Metformin tablets are prescribed in 500 mg doses [five hundred], not \"50 mg\" and not in \"grams\". The maximum allowable daily dose is 2000 mg [two thousand]. Your A1c is \"horrible\" indicating an average blood glucose level of 172 mg/dl. This is the reason for an increase in your daily does. See below on what you can do to help bring this to normal levels 5.4 - 6% (115 - 136 mg/dl) .\"I am now having to feed the\u00a0\u00a0medication to keep my levels from dropping too low ( like 32 to 40).\"Metformin helps to lower blood glucose levels not increase them.1. When are you testing to get the \"like 32 to 40\" levels?2. Do you have regular scheduled testing intervals? eg; fasting, b4 meals, and 2-3 hours after meals?\"I am gaining weight and my new A1C was 7.\"Changing lifestyle habits can go a long way in controlling type 2 diabetes. Restrict & avoid refined sugars, practice and adhere to weight control, do some sort of exercise daily, practice stress management, and get adequate sleep. These are all important in managing this illness, the most important, along with proper nutrition, is physical activity.A high A1C level indicates a 2 to 3 month period during which red blood cells have linked up with excess sugar molecules. The most common causes are bad food choices, sugary liquids, improper body weight, and lack of physical exercise. During that same period, the circulatory system and nervous system is put under stress. Caffeine stimulates the production of stress hormones, which increases glucose production by the liver.Besides watching sugar in your diet-- you also need to watch carbohydrates (starches) carefully too. For example-- things like breads, potatoes, pasta, crackers, etc. can cause a drastic rise in your blood sugar if you aren't careful. (They are converted to sugar after you eat them) Other foods/drinks need care too (example; milk, fruit, fruit juice) can also cause blood sugar to rise (so serving sizes and moderation are important). With fruit it\u2019s important to eat them with other foods to slow the absorption of fructose (fruit sugar). I'm NOT saying that these foods aren't allowed. What I AM saying is that you need to use care and follow the guidelines for diabetics.",

            "answer": "In addition to what waverider has said: If you are dropping to 32 to 40 you need to talk to your doctor; that is much too low. And having to overeat to keep your blood sugar up is indeed counter-productive! Keep close track of your numbers, highlighting both highs and lows and share them with your doctor. Or better yet get an appointment with an endo who is more specifically trained to assess blood sugar and medication doses.",

            "answer": "Waverider has provided excellent advice.It is very important to test frequently, and to think about having \"standardized\" meals, with the same approximate portions.Within the prescribed limits, which, as waverider has stated, generally recommend no more than 2,000 mg a day of Metformin, you need to be testing your blood sugars. The hba1c test every couple of months is not enough. And the other important thing, as waverider stated is WHEN you are testing.There are diabetic specialty nurses who are very helpful in working out a daily routine to insure to insure sugars are under control. In some programs they will see you once w week for eight to twelve weeks, until things get settled down.A book you may find helpful is \"The Idiot's Guide to Diabetes\".",
