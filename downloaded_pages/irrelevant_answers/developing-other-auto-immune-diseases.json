            "answer": "What lab test came back at 213 IU/ml?\u00a0\u00a0Have you had other thyroid tests done, such as TSH, Free T3 and Free T4?\u00a0\u00a0If so, can you post the results, along with the lab's reference ranges?Actually, it's quite common for people to get more than one autoimmune disease, but your doctor is right - there's no way to know your risk since each individual is different.\u00a0\u00a0 I, personally, have hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's, plus pernicious anemia, which is another autoimmune in which the body does not absorb vitamin B12.I have a son with juvenile diabetes (he's 37 and was diagnosed at age 10) and a 34 yr old daughter with lupus.\u00a0\u00a0Juvenile diabetes and lupus are both autoimmune also.",

    "question": "I have Hashimoto's.\u00a0\u00a0My lab test came back 213 IU/ml. Does this mean I have a higher probability than the average person w/o Hashimoto's of developing another auto immune disorder?\u00a0\u00a0My doctor said \"no way to know your risk\".\u00a0\u00a0That sounds logical, however, is there any study info available?\u00a0\u00a0I just want to be aware of the possibility/probability so if something does happen, I can catch it early.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you in advance.",
