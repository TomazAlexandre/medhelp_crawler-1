            "answer": "You sound exactly like me! I had a cake walk of a pregnancy and I feel I deserved it with going through fertility treatment for 2.5yrs and two losses before this one. I love being pregnant and it's been a breeze. I'm due in 9 days so not far behind you! Must have been something in the water at the time for us ;) haha also like you I'm not pooping my pants with worry of a terrible delivery cause I've had it so easy. Just trying to remain positive all will be fine though and I'm not holding any expectations regarding the labor. Whatever happens I'm fine with as long as me and her live.",

            "answer": "I'm 36 weeks and right now i feel like crap. Nausea came back, i think i might have popped my hip or leg out of place because i can barely walk which means i miss another day of work. Braxton hicks are kicking my butt which i thought that you wasn't supposed to feel them. And i have to poop all the time lol other than that i feel fine. I can't wait to meet my little girl. I'm soooo ready to have her",

    "question": "So i'm 39w 2d and therefore due in 5 days. I have had a breeze all my pregnancy, skipped all the 'cons' of pregnancy. No morning sickness, no nausea, no heartburn, no tiredness, no sleeping in the afternoon. I am very excited to meet my baby, how i feel though is worried about how my labor will be, sometimes i feel scared and nervous even when i have been reassured of our health. Normal?",
