            "answer": "It is not uncommon for panic attacks and anxiety attacks to be associated with chest pain. From what you are describing, it sounds like this is the most likely explanation for your symptoms.Chest pain associated with the heart is typically central or left sided. Your risk of heart disease depends on many things -- age, family history, tobacco use, and other medical conditions (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, high cholesterol, etc). If you have risk factors and are worried, it wouldn't be unreasonable to have a stress test, just to make sure the pains aren't coming from your heart.",

            "answer": "Thank you, that made me feel a lot better. Although some of the pressure can feel like it's in the middle of my chest, but not completely focused on my heart.Let me also note that I am only 18 and still in high school. I forgot to say my age. I don't really have any history of heart problems, except that my dad has a heart murmur but I don't have one. I don't smoke or drink, I am not obese, and I don't have diabetes. My only problem lately is severe anxiety.",

    "question": "Okay so I've been having anxiety and panic attacks for a few months now, and these last few days i've been feelinga sort of pressure in my chest, sometimes in the middle but it's mostly on the upper right side of my chest. And my right arm/hand becomes a little numb feeling. There is a little bit of pain in my chest as well, but it mostly feels like someone is just pressing on my chest sometimes. These sensations aren't 24/7 but they do happen often.Also I had called the ambulence and they came to my house to evaluate me, and i told them about my symptoms. They tested my blood pressure and heart rate and said my heart was all normal and that the pressure i'm feeling is most likely from anxiety, and my therapist thinks so too. But just for extra reassurence, what does anyone here have to say? I know that chest symptoms are common with anxiety/panic but i'm a little scared. Also, i've never had any history of heart problems or anything and this only started happening when I developed anxiety. Could it just be my chest muscles tightening and getting stiff/tense?",
