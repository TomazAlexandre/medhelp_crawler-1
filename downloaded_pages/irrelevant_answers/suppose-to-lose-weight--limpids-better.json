            "answer": "Levothyroxine is not, technically, a weight loss aid.\u00a0\u00a0If you gained weight due to hypothyroidism, it's possible that you may begin to drop it off, but that would only happen if your thyroid hormones are adequate, plus you would need to beating properly and getting adequate exercise. For many of us, weight does not \"automatically\" fall off once we get on thyroid replacement medication.Do\u00a0\u00a0you have current thyroid labs that you can post for us?\u00a0\u00a0If so, please post them and be sure to include reference ranges, which vary lab to lab and must come from your own report. That will help us better assess your testing/treatment and may allow us to make further comments on your situation.How long have you been on the levo?",

            "answer": "The lipid panels work \"IN\" correlation with thyroid function. The two are NOT related in distributing thyroid medication for lipid panel issues.IF you have conditions with low thyroid and high cholestrol\u00a0\u00a0numbers that is found in many patients with hypothyroidism and properly medicating with thyroid hormone based off thyroid labs can help aid you to lower lipid panels.As for weight loss in addition to the above issues, NOPE!!! NO WAY will thyroid meds ALONE shed you those gained pounds!!! Not - going-to happen!If you want true advice on hypothyroidism weight gain two things would come to my mind:1. Get optimal with your thyroid hormone within your body to regulate the metobolism again properly. ( Hense, regulating the metobolism is not necessarily attached to weight loss alone)2. Reduce your caloric intake and follow a SIMPLIFIED diet - eliminating sugar- all refined carbs and pract,ice hydration (H20), high protein and GREEN (colorful) veggies/ little or NO fruit.",
