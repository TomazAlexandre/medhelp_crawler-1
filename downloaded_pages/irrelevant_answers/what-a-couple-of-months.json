My mother-in-law has been diabetic since her second child 40 years ago and even though she takes care of herself she is in the hospital with complications due to her diabetes. I'm glad your lump was only a cyst but I'm very happy for you about the diabetes. It's going to make a world of difference in your future.",

    "question": "Well back in september i found a small pea size lump under my arm pit, well i tried to ignore it was worried about the big C,\u00a0\u00a0well it continued to grow till 2 weeks ago it was the size of a golf ball, i couldnt ignore it any longer, so off i went to the doctors, you all know about my needle phobia, so i nearly fell off the chair when he pulled out a needle to do a biopsy, today i got the results and it turned out to be a harmless cyst, what a relief. I know i was silly not to go to the doctors strieght away. but luckly it turned out ok, i would advise anyone in the same situation get it checked out dont wait its not worth the stress,Also today i was taken of my metformin i am no longer considered a medicated diabetic,\u00a0\u00a0so great news all round",
