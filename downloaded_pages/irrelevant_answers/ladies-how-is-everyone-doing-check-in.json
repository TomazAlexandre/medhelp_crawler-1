    "question": "Been a while since I've heard from any of you.. How is it going?? I'm so eager and restless right now! I'm nesting like crazy and I can't sleep.I'll start by updating you all on me. Had an apt. yesterday, no progress \"down there\" still 1 cm, don't know % on the effacement, but I'm somewhat thinned out.. I just finished packing everything ready for the hospital and making some adjustments.. Dr. said I could choose to be induced on Tuesday [1 week] if I wanted to be. But I think [right now I feel this way, atleast] that I'll just wait it out.Geeze girls, I've only got 12 days left, can you believe it?? I almost can't.How is everyone? Anyone made any progress so far, how many days left? How are you all feeling? Feel like me and about done sharing your body yet? lol I like knowing he's safe, but I want it back to myself now, he can come out whenever he's ready! Haha. :)",
