            "answer": "HiI am so sorry to learn about your symptoms and am happy you want to be an informed participant in your health.There are many possibilities for your symptoms, entirely based on the post and without a physical examination, like Hypothyroidism (http://www.endocrineweb.com/hypo1.html), problem in ovaries, and problems in kidneys like glomerulonehritis or nephritic syndrome.Please refer: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000484.htmhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000490.htmYou need to undergo some blood tests as outlined in these links, ultrasounds and CT scans to rule out these conditions.Also you must check out if you have diabetes that has started affecting your organs and nervous system.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your prompt and informative reply.I checked out the links you provided, and though some of the symptoms are very close, some are not.\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure is not chronically high (or low), just intermittently so.\u00a0\u00a0And my cholesterol is actually quite low (my dad, 50, had three strokes in January with no apparent cause, so each of us \"kids\" had a good work up at that time), and I don't experience swelling (except for when my hands get bright red and hot; they do swell then).\u00a0\u00a0I do suspect it's possible my kidneys may be involved in whatever's going on (especially with the intermittent protein in my urine), and I know some things with kidney involvement (like SLE) don't have symptoms with the kidenys but rather are detected through tests and labs.Like I said, I do plan to see a rheumatologist and hope to get answers then, but I'm a little neurotic about trying to figure things out NOW :)Your information was very helpful, and I appreciate being able to read up on any possibility.\u00a0\u00a0Any other ideas I can read up on? :)Thank you so much!!\u00a0\u00a0You are so very helpful!!",

            "answer": "HiI am glad you found the links informative. I would suggest a few things.Make a note of your symptoms, chronologically as they appeared.See if they were in any way related to your menstrual cycle.Check if tests for thyroid and diabetes were done.Check if kidney function tests were done.Check if the cause of low red blood cells and blood in urine, has been looked into.Only seeing a rheumatologist will probably not help, though a step in the right direction. Maybe a specialist in internal medicine and urologist will be able to help you better. If your symptoms are related to your menstrual cycle then probably you should see a gynecologist too.Please let me know what your doctors say. Please let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted.",

    "question": "I have had various ambiguous symptoms for at least 10 years, including joint pain, flushing red face across cheeks, fatigue, headaches, painful breathing, rising and falling blood pressure, inflammation in my lungs, low red blood cell count, protein in my urine, mental fog, dizziness, pins and needles if I sit too long, cold hands and feet, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I typically do not have all symptoms at once, and they come and go in intensity, though \"flares\" usually involve a significant degree of most of them.\u00a0\u00a0For the last few months, my joint pain has been increasingly severe, the flushing and heat in my face is daily, I sunburn even through my clothes, etc.My blood tests show normal RF and ANA, neg for Lyme disease, so my primary doc wanted to proceed as if this is fibro.\u00a0\u00a0However, I don't react to the tender points, have no touch sensitivity, no muscle pain or soreness, etc.\u00a0\u00a0He has had me try two different antidepressants for pain.\u00a0\u00a0Though they cut the pain a little, my other symptoms are not relieved, and the side effects I've experienced have been tough: nausea, headaches, break-out on my face, urinary retention, mood and personality changes, constipation, etc.\u00a0\u00a0On Cymbalta I literally could not eat for a week, and now on Elavil I'm feeling angry, weepy, etc. when I have no history of depression or anxiety.I have not yet seen a rheumatologist, so I plan to make an appointment with or without a referral.\u00a0\u00a0I'm interested in being able to do my own research, though, about other possible conditions this could be.\u00a0\u00a0I want to be an informed participant in my health, so I want to know as much as possible about what tests to ask for, what conditions to consider, etc. before I see the rheumatologist.\u00a0\u00a0Any advice?Thanks in advance!!",
