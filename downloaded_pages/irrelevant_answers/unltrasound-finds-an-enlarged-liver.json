            "answer": "Hi, wow, I am getting alot of good info on here tonight, I'm so glad to have found this board!\u00a0\u00a0roxnsox, you seem to be so informed, I have learned alot reading your responses, thanks!\u00a0\u00a0My doctor seems to think I have fatty liver, I have raised liver enzymes ALT is 88 (range 0-50), and AST is 37 (range 2-35).\u00a0\u00a0I had a sonogram that showed fatty infiltration of the liver, and all other tests (blood work) came back normal, I was a little high on something called Polys, which was 78 (range 40-74).\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I liked my former GI, who has left the area, he seemed to think he was sure that I had a fatty liver, and just said to loose weight and come back in six months to see if they drop.\u00a0\u00a0The thing is, I went to another GI to ask about a liver cleansing diet, and he wanted to take some autoimmune tests, saying that it would be a good idea to rule that out.\u00a0\u00a0I have read about this, and that scares me alot, and I just think that I would like to follow the advice of the first doctor that I liked, and assume it's fatty liver.\u00a0\u00a0This new doctor was not really friendly and sort of acted annoyed by my questions, don't you hate that?\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I was just kind of wondering how common it is to have raised liver enzymes with fatty liver, and if autoimmune testing is routine with these raised enzymes.\u00a0\u00a0I don't really have any other symptoms, except that I am overweight, and I think the other doctor just put two and two together, with my weight, the sonogram, and all the other blood tests coming back normal.\u00a0\u00a0I do get tired alot, but then I stay up all night!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks in advance, and sorry to have written so much!!\u00a0\u00a0Valerie",

    "question": "I am currently 5 months pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0LAte into my 3rd month, I started experiencing sharp pain in the area of my Gall Bladder.\u00a0\u00a0Concerned that I may have gallstones, my OB decided that I should have an ultrasound of the Gall Bladder.\u00a0\u00a0at the ultrasound they took images of the gall bladder along with the liver and kidneys.\u00a0\u00a0My OB called me yesterday to inform me that I do not have gallstones but he is concerned that my liver appears to be a bit larger than normal.\u00a0\u00a0He stated that there are no lesions or tumors on the liver. He wants me to take a Liver function test.\u00a0\u00a0And he said it could be possible that although slightly larger, this may be a normal size liver for me.I do not drink or smoke or use any drugs.\u00a0\u00a0I've never been at risk for AIDS (OB performed test for it anyway and it came back fine).\u00a0\u00a0I do take 1/2 of a 25mg of Atenonol for tachycardia which was prescribed by my cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0The only over the counter medication that I take is Tylenol for occasional headaches or muscle pain.Can it be possible that the pregnancy caused the liver to enlarge?\u00a0\u00a0What are some reasons for the liver to enlarge?\u00a0\u00a0What other tests are available to make certain that my liver is healthy, functioning properly, and the size is appropriate for me?Thanks in advance for any information.",
