            "answer": "Thank you for your advice. I have already scheduled a meeting with another GYN and unfortunately it is not until the middle of October because I'm new patient. Mean while I don't know what type of cyst I have (fuctional or nonfuctional). I am very anxious and hope that the new GYN will take me and my patient history more seriously. I hope that I will get more details and better TX from the next GYN. Thanks again. I will talk with the GYN about your suggestions.",

    "question": "Hi, I am a 23 yrs of age and have recently become aware of an ovarian cyst. I developed a 1 in. lump in the right lower pelvic reg. in March. Since than I have had 2 ultra sound exams that were approx. 3-4 monthes apart both showing the size to be 1 in. and unchanged. I have been put on 2 months of birth control to shrink the size but am experiencing side effects from the pill and still have discomfort in the R lower pelvic reg. My GYN advised to finish the prescription. Mean while she has not told me too many details about the results from either of the ultra sounds or what all my options are. She doesn't seem to believe the pain and discomfort is coming from the cyst but doesn't offer any other possible causes. I know my own body and I can feel a sm. mass in the R lower reg. upon palpating. This is the same place the pain is located. I need some answers and don't know what else to do. Please help me. Thanks.",
