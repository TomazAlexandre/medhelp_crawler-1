            "answer": "Hi!Your father has two main conditions (diabetes and hypertension) which can cause small blood vessels in the brain to block up. This causes ischemic changes known as infarcts which are seen as white lesions on MRI. Once the blood supply is cut off the brain tissue starts atrophy. Atrophy can also be age related. Since the cerebellum is affected, it could be a cause of vertigo. Other possibilities are a sudden drop in blood sugar or blood pressure. Both should be monitored for 24 hours to se if there is a drop. Do discuss this with your father\u2019s doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
