            "answer": "Was just wondering if your grandson has been checked for Hemochromatosis.\u00a0\u00a0 It is an iron overload disease with many symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0 My 15 year old grandson has it - was diagnosed at 10.It can be controlled by drinking green tea to make one anemic. -But, before he tries anything, have the doctor check his iron and ferritin levels.\u00a0\u00a0I am only a \"carrier\" of the disease but have had three phlebotomies myself.\u00a0\u00a0 (they take out a pint of blood and throw it away).Some doctors prefer to do chelation treatments - but phlebotomy is the treatment of choice.Please look up Hemochromatosis - he seems to have some of the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Very common in people of European stock.",

            "answer": "I fought with doctor's for years about symptoms that mimicked Diabetes and it turned out to be a problem called Orthostatic Intolerance.Anyways, it's something I think you should continue pursuing if he is continuing to have the same problems.Mono is very common at his age. I had Mono and got it from sharing a milk shake with my best friend who shortly after was diagnosed with Mono. I then also had it along with Tonsillitis, and Bronchitis at the same time. I was 17 when that happened.If his current doctor continues to have disinterest in these abnormalities he is having it may be time to follow up with a new doctor for a second opinions.I hope you find answers soon and that he is well.",
