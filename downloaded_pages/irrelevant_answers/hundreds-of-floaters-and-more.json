            "answer": "He has been checked for Lyme's disease, and does not have it. Both I and my other younger brother have had Lyme's disease in the past. Both of my brothers have a congenital high-frequency hearing loss, as well.He had recently (a month ago) stopped taking Depakote after four years of being on it. It was properly titrated; not just stopped abruptly, but I have noticed changes in his behavior since then. Could this all be psychosomatic?",

You can test negative and still have it.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, if you tested positive then you are one of the fortunate ones.\u00a0\u00a0I think the fact that 2 people in the family have\u00a0\u00a0had it makes it even more likely.",

            "answer": "Floaters can also be caused by a posterior vitrerous detachment.\u00a0\u00a0When we're born, the vitreous is the consistency of egg white, but as we get a little older, it begins to harden and pulls away from the retina, causing floaters.\u00a0\u00a0The floaters, if caused by this, are harmless, but annoying.\u00a0\u00a0If a person gets so many of them, vision is impaired, then they can be removed, but doctors prefer not to do so as it can cause blindness.\u00a0\u00a0Other opthamologic causes of floaters are retinal tears, cystoid macular edema, and asteroid hyalosis.\u00a0\u00a0It's best to see a good opthamologist.Floaters are indeed a symptom of Lyme disease.\u00a0\u00a0Did you have conjunctivitis at any time?\u00a0\u00a0Most patients with Lyme disease who develop floaters do, but not all.\u00a0\u00a0I agree with the above posters - Lyme disease is very hard to diagnose, but your doctors needs to be aggressive in doing so and ruling it out.\u00a0\u00a0It's not psychosomatic.",

            "answer": "My brother has never had conjunctivitis, although I have.I also forgot to mention that he has high cholesterol, but is average weight for his age and height. He does eat a large amount of sugary foods and drinks a lot of soda. Whenever any sweet-tasting thing is brought into my house, he will eat or drink all of it within two days. He will drink four cans of soda in one afternoon if I do not stop him. He's 16 and he's not mentally challenged in any way, but is very stupid when it comes to personal health and safety.As for any psychosomatic symptoms, I should have been more clear: the floaters are definitely real, but what about the others (an increasingly loud ringing in his ears, blue and red halos around light sources, extreme sensitivity to motion)? He only started having these problems after he found out about the floaters, and they only recur when he happens to notice the floaters when he stares at a white wall or other white surface. Once he forgets about the floaters, he stops having the other symptoms.Caregiver222, you mentioned that the floaters may a sign of diabetes, how likely is this?",

    "question": "My brother has been complaining of floaters in his eyes for years. I've been told that this is normal, and nothing to worry about. As I sometimes see floaters as well, I understand the experience and it doesn't bother me. My brother, on the other hand, claims to see hundreds of them, and recently has been complaining of several other symptoms as well. I think it's all in his head, but maybe there's some little-known condition that fits the bill.His symptoms are large amounts of floaters, an increasingly loud ringing in his ears, blue and red halos around light sources, extreme sensitivity to motion, and pains in his legs. Any ideas?",
