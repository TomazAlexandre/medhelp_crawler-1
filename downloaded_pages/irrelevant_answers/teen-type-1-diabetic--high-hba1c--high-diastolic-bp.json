            "answer": "This sounds very frustrating indeed. I'm the mother of a 17-year-old type-1, not a doc, so I can't give you any medical advice, but I do have some questions. Is he seeing an endocrinologist or just an internist? This challenge certainly seems to demand a specialist. It doesn't make sense why an A1c would be that high if he rarely shows high blood sugars on his monitors. Is he testing regularly? Is he on Lantus/glargine? (That really helped stabilize my daughter.)Let us know, and good luck with this challenge.",

            "answer": "Hi,Speaking from personal experience, dealing with blood sugar levels through your teen years can seem a challenge from time to time.\u00a0\u00a0When I had a high A1C reading with my endochronologist, and looking back over the glucometer readings, my doctor asked me to try testing much more often for a week (before meals, an hour after meals, before bed and every two hours throughout the night). We ultimately discovered I was having peak highs overnight.\u00a0\u00a0The best way to find out about where your son's highs may be is for him to check his blood sugar avidly.\u00a0\u00a0That is the only suggestion I can make as I am no doctor but through my own personal experience.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this is of some help.",
