            "answer": "Test his BG before he eats and 1 hour after.for many people they get reactive hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0They eat BG rises high then the pancreas makes insulin and too much so BG goes down too far.Many that have reactive hypos end up developing diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0so it is a good idea to keep on top of it.also carbohydrates raise BG \" almonds, boiled eggs and tomatoes\" not many carbs in that.\u00a0\u00a0the oatmeal would have a lot of carbs and a lot of carbs can cause a reactive hypo.\u00a0\u00a0also is you meter good?\u00a0\u00a0that could be the problem.",

            "answer": "Hi and thank you for your thoughts.We tested before he ate and one hour after. It was 57 before he ate (lunch) and about 53 an hour later.I thought about the meter. It is a couple of years old.Do you have a brand you recommend? We've looked at so many and the reviews for accuracy aren't great.Also, I forgot to include this before:My husband's family has a hypoglycemic and diabetes history.I've read a 25% protein, 50% non starchy carbs, 25% starchy carbs +good fats, is a good balance for a hypoglycemic diet. What do you think? Any links our recommendations are appreciated.Thank You.",

    "question": "Hello,Question about too low of blood sugar.My husband has fasting blood sugar in the 50's and even after a pretty good meal they barely move up and then go back to fasting within an hours.I know this isn't diabetes but didn't see a hypoglycemia category.Today his pre-lunch blood sugar was 43. He said he felt fine, but I gave him a snack of almonds, boiled eggs and tomatoes anyway. He had oatmeal, w/butter, cream for breakfast only a few hours earlier. BTW--very little activity this morning, just working the desk job.Not sure what to do with this--trying to correct with diet but am at a loss. Most doctors only care if you have high blood sugar and think you should celebrate if it's low. (I've been and was told my fasting 60's are nothing to worry about). We're not celebrating--I'm concerned.Thoughts?",
