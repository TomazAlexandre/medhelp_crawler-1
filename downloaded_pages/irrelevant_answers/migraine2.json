            "answer": "Hi,I suggest that you mom seek consult with an ENT specialist just to rule out involvement of the ears, nasal passages and sinuses. An inner ear problem may cause dizziness or vertigo. A CT scan will help rule out any intracranial disorder . Decreased blood flow to the base of the brain may cause dizziness.Were previous scans done?Any underlying problems like hypertension ( anti hypertensive medications may cause\u00a0\u00a0BP to drop when not monitored closely), diabetes, vision problems, nutrition problems?",

            "answer": "Hi,Given that she has been properly assessed and her underlying thyroid disorder and blood pressure are well controlled, then this may sound like a bout of migraine headaches. However, thyroid problems and even medications may sometimes present with headaches. It is best that she is being monitored closely.Migraines may be associated with weather change however this is not firmly established. Nausea and vomiting may also be associated with migraines.Provide your mom proper protection during extreme changes in temperature if this has ben triggering her headaches.",
