            "answer": "Hi, welcome to the forum, your symptoms are suggestive of paresthesia of limb. It can be due to nerve compression which can be due to carpal tunnel syndrome. This occurs due increased pressure on the nerve secondary to hereditary, hypothyroidism, obesity etc. The other possibilities are diabetes, vitamin B5 and B12 deficiency and fibromyalgia.You need to undergo evaluation like thyroid status, blood sugar, CSF analysis and certain serological tests.Carpal tunnel syndrome can be managed by- Splinting of wrist may limit activities that raise pressure within the carpal tunnel or reduce its cross sectional area.- Corticosteroids against prescription can be injected proximal or distal to the carpal tunnel will provide good relief. Oral corticosteroids appear to be effective for short-term improvement of CTS symptoms.- Other available therapies are Carpal bone mobilization, Nerve gliding, Ultrasound therapy, NSAIDS and other oral medications, Electrical, magnetic, and laser therapy.I suggest you to consult a neurologist and get evaluated to rule out the cause and take appropriate treatment. Take care and regards.",
