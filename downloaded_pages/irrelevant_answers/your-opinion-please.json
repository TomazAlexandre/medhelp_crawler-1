I have always been thin and find it virtually impossble to gain weight, i also go from extreme energy to lethargy.\u00a0\u00a0I also have had continual eye problems for the least two years, my eyes go all red and swollen with a jelly consistency. I know that alot of these symptoms sound like anxiety but i really feel that there is more to it.\u00a0\u00a0I have a good home life and feel that i am good at my job, it all seems over reactive and irrational at times like i am losing my mind.\u00a0\u00a0Please could someone give me some advice, i don't want to approach my doctor in case they think i am being stupid, but i feel like i can't hide how i feel much longer, it is ruining my life.",
