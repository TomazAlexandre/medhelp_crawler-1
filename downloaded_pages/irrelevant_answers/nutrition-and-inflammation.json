            "answer": "You might already know this, but I thought I would share it just in case.\u00a0\u00a0There is pretty good evidence that turmeric and ginger have powerful anti-inflammatory properties.\u00a0\u00a0I started taking the caps and also put lots of turmeric on my food.\u00a0\u00a0I typed in inflammation and food, different spices and supplements to see what I could come up with, and they were the two that were the most impressive as far as any real evidence.\u00a0\u00a0It is believed that that is why people in India (who use lots of turmeric) have a much lower incidence of Alzheimer's (and possibly other diseases in which inflammation plays a part).\u00a0\u00a0I also put ground flax seeds on my food (on days I don't take the gel caps), though fish oil is supposed to be even better (I'm vegetarian, so I haven't decided if I want to take that yet).\u00a0\u00a0And if you have issues with regulating blood sugar (type 2 diabetes) or high cholesterol, cinnamon caps have been shown in some studies to be as effective as some of the statin drugs.\u00a0\u00a0For some reason cinnamon taken not inside capsules (due to interaction with one's saliva) is not thought to be as effective, so I just take the caps (I saw that on CNN).\u00a0\u00a0I believe in doing whatever you can to help your body, especially when you can't get help elsewhere...",

    "question": "I went to my chiropractor/nutrionist today.\u00a0\u00a0She went to a seminar about nutrition and said they were talking to her about me.\u00a0\u00a0It sounded like everything I was going through.She is having me complete a MetaMetrics urine analysis metabolic panel.\u00a0\u00a0She is sending a copy of the report along with another report and phone call to my neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0She wants to work with him about the nutrition aspect.She told me about the seminar and what she learned.\u00a0\u00a0There are certain foods and combinations of foods that can increase the inflammation of the body and lead to diseases that express similar symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0This is in connection with hormonal changes and fluctuations.\u00a0\u00a0An example from the\u00a0\u00a0seminar was a girl with two unexplained lesions in her brain and exhibited very similar symptoms as I had.\u00a0\u00a0The girl is now on a strict diet and exercise program and doing extremely well.We talked and agreed that if we can get my nutrition together, any inflammation caused by nutritional deficits and/or problems will be elimanated.\u00a0\u00a0This way if it is strictly nutrition, problem solved, but if it isn't, the real problem might be brought to light, because my nutrition won't be an issue that could mask everything else.\u00a0\u00a0I was told I have low B12 counts and am iron deficient (anemic).\u00a0\u00a0I was also told there is unexplained inflammation on the right side of my brain based on perliminary radiologist report last week.\u00a0\u00a0All my symptoms have an underlying root in inflamation, so maybe it will be a step towards feeling better without the drowsiness of meds.",
