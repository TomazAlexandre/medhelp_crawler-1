            "answer": "A nerve conduction study will show whether there is damage to the peripheral nervous system. MS is a central nervous system disease, so NCS will not give info about MS. It's possible, though rare, to have both central and peripheral nervous system problems.'Neuropathy' generally refers to peripheral neuropathy, such as that caused by diabetes. If you are a diabetic, it's very probable that that's what is causing your symptoms. Should your MRI be clear, the probability becomes overwhelming.There is, of course, such a thing as centrally-caused neuropathy, but the MRI should clear up this issue.ess",

            "answer": "Hi LG - Welcome to the group.Everything ess says is true. I can personally attest to the existance of MS related neuropathic pain. I have it in me feet. It is very similar to the foot pain experienced by diabetics. In fact one of the meds I take to control it is Lyrica, now being advertized to control diabetic nerve pain. I am not diabetic :-)Your MRI will help focus your search towards either the peripheral or central nervous system. It should include head, c-spine and t-spine all done with and without contrast. Other tests include blood tests to rule out MS mimics like Lyme disease and lumbar punctures to look for signs of central nervous system inflammation.Keep us posted!Kyle",

    "question": "I am in the process of being diagnosed with something, possibly MS. I have many of the symptoms of MS, and have an MRI on Friday. My question is: I have been having NCS done every year for several year now, always showing damage, which I have been told has been caused by diabetes, every though I've only had it for about 6 years and it's well controlled. I have the symptoms of neuropathy. Could this be MS? Does a NCS show the difference between MS and diabetic neuropathy, or were they just assuming that's what I had?Thanks",
