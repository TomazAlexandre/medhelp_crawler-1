            "answer": "Goolara, I think you must work in statistics!Jena, you should get the TGab test, too. You can be positive in one and not the other. Also, get a thyroid ultrasound. Your freeT3/T4 are on the low end of normal. You would probably do well with some thyroid hormone. What would it have hurt the doctor to try you on a low dose and go from there? Geez!Find a doc who can treat your frees and not your TSH, which is a pituitary hormone. At least this one did the reverse T3. That's a start. Now you need to find a doc who actually knows how to recognize and treat low numbers.Jena, here's the site where I found my endo. It's not fool proof. Call ahead and ask how many thyroid vs diabetes patients this doc treats. Too many endos specialize in diabetes, not thryoid!http://www.thyroid-info.com/topdrs/:) Tamra",

            "answer": "To put it in less mathematical terms:\u00a0\u00a0you should have roughly equal amounts of FT3 and RT3, at the lower end, to roughly twice the amount of FT3 to RT3, at the upper end.\u00a0\u00a0You have less FT3 than RT3, and this can cause hypo symptoms even though your FT3 and FT4 are both within range.\u00a0\u00a0It's technically not hypothyroidism, but a failure to metabolize FT4 into FT3 properly.I think a new doctor is definitely in order.\u00a0\u00a0Too many don't understand basic thyroid problems, let alone anything a bit more complicated or unusual.\u00a0\u00a0Interview your prospective doctors (probably through a nurse) over the phone before making an appointment and ask them flat out if they have expertise in treating RT3 dominance.\u00a0\u00a0You could save yourself a lot of time and money.",
