            "answer": "usually a black and blue nail means you damaged the nail and it will probably fall off and you will grow another one. Maybe when you sprained your ankle you damaged your toes too or bruised them or it is a separate injury. Is the blister a blood blister? If so you should burst these like you can a water blister. Usually, with diabetes you get a neuropathy. You can have your fasting blood sugar taken to be sure but it sounds more like a injury.",

            "answer": "If the nail is black ands blue, it will eventually come off and regrow. Not a big problem. If, on the other hand the toe is purple, you have a potential emergency and need to see a podiatrist immediately for an in-person evaluation. Ocasionally toe infections develop into osteomyelitis, which can spread to the bones of the feet.",

    "question": "What is wrong with my toe? I sprained my ankle about a month ago. Since then (I don't know if this is related....), I developed 'black and blueness' under the toenail (looks like dried up blood, maybe?), and the toe next to it has developed a blister (I believe my small toe has swollen). My mom thinks it could be early signs of diabetes, due to poor circulation after my sprain. Any suggestions? I was thinking either fungus, ingrown toenail, or...diabetic symptoms.Picture: http://tinypic.com/r/2weyqn8/6",
