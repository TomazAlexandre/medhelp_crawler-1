            "answer": "What you are experiencing is called Dawn Phenomenon or the Somogyi effect [the doctor who first wrote about DP]. During your nighttime sleep your body is doing two things; one, the body makes certain hormones called counterregulatory hormones, which work against the action of insulin. Second, the liver releases glucose that it has stored in anticipation of the energy you need when you awake. Don't get freaked out, DP is a normal human body process.So, what can one do to control DP? Cut out late night before bedtime snacking. Are you on insulin? If you take insulin injections, it could be that the effect of insulin you took is waning. Your blood glucose will rise if you didn\u2019t take enough to keep your insulin level up through the night. Some people claim that vinegar tablets taken before bedtime works to prevent DP. This much is known, Dawn Phenomenon varies from person to person and can even vary from time to time in each of us. I suggest you talk with your doctor to hear what professional has to say.",

            "answer": "Hi,the dawn phenomenon is quite common in people with diabetes.This happens because your liver dumps glucose during the early morning to counter the fasting.\u00a0\u00a0IN people without diabetes insulin then steps up and keeps sugar levels normal.\u00a0\u00a0In people with diabetes, this may not happen efficiently and hence the high morning sugars.Actually, a small snack (high protein and fat) before you sleep may help.\u00a0\u00a0Another option is doing some exercise in the evenings (may help some).All the lifestyle things like eating low carb, exercising, normal weight may help.For me I find the dawn phenomenon is worse if I eat too many carbs and/or too many calories the preceeding day.\u00a0\u00a0Low carb diet is my personal best remedy.Monitor when it happens and what you ate the day before.It could also reflect that your a slightly sick.... with a cold or something, when it can become worse.Truely normal fasting blood sugar would be in range of 70 - 80.\u00a0\u00a0The 95 or 126 nos they use are already well above what is truely normal.",
