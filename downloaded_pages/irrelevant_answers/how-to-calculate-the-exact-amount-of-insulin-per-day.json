            "answer": "I see the confusionIf I understand you, you think Levemir is used for carbohydrates.\u00a0\u00a0Levemir is a basle insulin, meaning it works for 24 hours.\u00a0\u00a0Like a background insulin.\u00a0\u00a0the amount of Levemir taken has nothing to do with the amount of carbohydrates (carbs) you eat.\u00a0\u00a0That type of insulin is called a bolis insulin, like Apedra, Novalog...\u00a0\u00a0that insulin is taken according to how many carbs are eating and YOUR particular carb to insulin ratio.",

            "answer": "Yes there is a relation between insulin dose and carbs, the relation is between fast acting insulin and carbs NOT Levemir and carbs.eating carbs will raise BG in a short time IE 3 or 4 hours.\u00a0\u00a0and will stay high untill your body makes enough insulin or you inject FAST insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Taking levemir to counter eating will result in dangerously low BG (Hypoglycemia)!Insulin use is difficult to explain,\u00a0\u00a0you need to talk to an MD that knows how to administer Basal/Bolus insulin therapy.\u00a0\u00a0And or read the book\"Using insulin by John Walsh\"Levemir is used to regulate your fasting BG.\u00a0\u00a0and the fast insulin used to counter carbohydrate in the diet.That does NOT mean you keep eating and use Levemir to get your fasting BG to normal.",

            "answer": "The other posters are correct.You need to see your Dr or nurse practioner to discuss treatment in detail, and to get training and guidance on how to proceed.Levermir (and other long acting insulins) are called basal insulins. It is supposed to maintain your blood sugar stable if you do not eat.\u00a0\u00a0Levemir is typically dosed twice a day (morning and evening).\u00a0\u00a0Lantus, a different long acting insulin, is typically dosed once a day.\u00a0\u00a0There is also a new extra long acting insulin called Tresiba, which is also dosed once a day.Many people with diabetes also need a fast acting insulin, which will be taken before eating, with the dose based on how much carbs you are eating.\u00a0\u00a0 Such fast acting insulins are Novolog, Humalog, etc.This approach is called MDI (multiple daily injections).",
