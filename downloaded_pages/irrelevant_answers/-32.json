            "answer": "I WOULD NOT keep scratching!! Most likely you are itchy because the skin is stretching. Try drinking lots of water to hydrate your body from within. Also get a good moisturizing lotion, it should help with the itching. Coconut oil will help not to be so itchy. Keep your skin moisturized and hydrated from the inside out. But dont scratch, that will make stretchmarks worse!",

            "answer": "I started being really itchy at 30weeks with no rash, told my doctor and they drew blood to check my liver, apparently you can get a pregnancy induced liver disease that goes away after you give birth, in my case my results came back negative so it's just another normal pregnancy symptom. My mom was itchy during her pregnancy as well and it had to do with her having gestational diabetes, hopes this helps, just talk to your doctor if it's really bothersome",

            "answer": "I do have gestational diabetes. And I'm not scratching on my stomach or my sides BCUZ of the stretch marks. But I haven't gotten any extra for this pregnancy. And on both my other pregnancies I started getting stretch marks early on. My first one I weighed 140 when I found out I was prego. By like 5 months I was 110. I had to force myself to eat. By his due date I got up to 130 again. Second baby I started at 165 and left the hospital at 203:( when my second was about 6 months I got down to 138!!!:) by the time he was a year old I was 176 and preg again yesterday at the doctor I was 194. @ 32 weeks. So I didn't gain a lot during this pregnancy. So maybe swelling??? I plan on losing weight again but trying to keep it off!!!",

But I woke up this morning, and it was through out the night (but I didn't think anything of it),\u00a0\u00a0I've been itching. My arms wrists and legs and the sides of my stomach. My last several doctor visits I've kept the same wait... I went for my most recent yesterday and had gained four pounds since the previous two over a month visits.. anyways..its pretty constant...I can't stop scratching:( what could this be? There's no rash..my skin doesn't hurt..its red but only because I keep scratching and rubbing BCUZ I don't want extra stretch marks.",
