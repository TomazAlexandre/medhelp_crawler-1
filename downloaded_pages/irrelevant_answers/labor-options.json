            "answer": "It's a tough decision, and your doctor is pretty much right about inducing prior sections.\u00a0\u00a0About the only thing they can do is to break your water, and you'd have to be a couple cm's dilated before they could do that anyway.\u00a0\u00a0Some doctors might give you low dose pitocin, but that's really it.So if you wind up going to 39-40 weeks with no labor and no sign of being dilated, you will probably have to have a section.\u00a0\u00a0Plan on it, and then you'll be pleasantly surprised if you do go into labor and can try it on your own, if your doc feels the baby isn't too big.",

            "answer": "Wow, after that experience I would not really want to try again, 5 hrs pushing!\u00a0\u00a0My sis had to have an emergency C-section with her first baby as he did not tolerate the induction well.\u00a0\u00a0It was rough on her, but she said the planned C-sections for her next 2 were surprising easier to recover from.\u00a0\u00a0My friend said the same thing.\u00a0\u00a0I did not have diabetes, but my first one was 10 lbs. 3 oz. and I tore completely through my episiotomy through my rectum.\u00a0\u00a0It took a long time to heal and even now with my son 3 1/2 I still have problems.\u00a0\u00a0My second baby was induced early to prevent any more damage.\u00a0\u00a0Had I known what I would be going through for a recovery I would have probably thought about the C-section too.\u00a0\u00a0The others are right, if you go into labor on your own, yay, sometimes after you've had a baby you will go sooner, and since you went through the labor your cervix knows what to do.\u00a0\u00a0If you have not had baby by the time you have your scheduled C-section, then you have the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I can see why you would want to have a vaginal birth, but trust me, it's not worth putting yourself in a bad position for.\u00a0\u00a0Either way you get a healthy baby.\u00a0\u00a0I had to schedule a C-section for my first baby because he was breech, but he ended up turning just in time at 39 weeks and I avoided it.\u00a0\u00a0Looking b ack I would have been lucky to get the C-section, but still am happy with the final outcome.",

    "question": "Me and my doctor discussed the way i should have my next baby.\u00a0\u00a0My first son was delivered by c-section because of what he weighed and the induced me right around 38 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I was in labor for a really long time and the baby was turned the wrong way and i pushed for almost 5 hours and then they finally decided to do th c-section.\u00a0\u00a0With this baby I want to try and have her naturally because I didn't like doing the c-section.\u00a0\u00a0I am a diabetic and they say diabetics normally have larger babies and that's why they are normally induced early.\u00a0\u00a0But since I have had a c-section my doctor said they can't induce me and that I have to go into labor on my own if I want to have her naturally and I really do,but I really don't know what I should do?",
