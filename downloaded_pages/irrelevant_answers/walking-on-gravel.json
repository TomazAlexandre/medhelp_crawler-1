            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!The various causes of leg pain are atherosclerosis, deep vein thrombosis - leg pain on walking (A blood clot in a deep vein), Leriche syndrome (block in abdominal aorta and/or main leg artery), limb ischaemia (low oxygen to limbs), sciatica, spondylitis of lower vertebrae and peripheral vascular disease (arteries of limbs are involved). Doppler tests will rule out the possibility of involvement of an artery or vein. An angiogram too can be done.The symptoms could also be due to spinal nerve compression in the lumbo-sacral region. This can occur due to spondylosis, narrowing of root canal, bulging disc, reduced disc space, tumors etc. A MRI of the region can help you diagnose this. Please consult a neurologist for this.There is a chance that you have a vascular problem. Clots in deep veins of legs and deep vein thrombosis can cause similar symptoms. Consult a vascular surgeon for this.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I suffer from a permanent ( except when lying down ) sensation from the calves of both legs downwards to the soles of my feet. The nerves are visible, moving in waves along the calf muscle , and the undersides of the feet feel as though I am walking barefoot on gravel . I have suffered this for 7 years .I also suffered backpain and my surgeon operated on my spine ( discs ) which he hoped would cure both problems. In fact the back pain was cured but the 'tingling/ walking on gravel ' sensation persists.Whilst I have read on these pages of similar cases I have never come across anyone with exactly the same symptoms ie. the nerve waves, and the gravel feeling. Walking only worsens the symptoms , restricting how far I can go and necessitating a rest after about half a mile.I have recently been diagnosed with borderline diabetes .Can you offer any suggestions ?",
