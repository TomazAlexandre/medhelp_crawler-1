Slightly elevated temperature is generally due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroid states, overwork, stress and fatigue. It is also seen in diseases like tuberculosis. Also you must consult a sleep specialist for your daughter. Take care!",

    "question": "My 15 year old daughter has started running a low grade fever, and is sleepingabout 14 hours a day.\u00a0\u00a0She has been to the doctor and tested for Epstein Barr and mono she has also had a cbc and a liver function test run.\u00a0\u00a0There is slight swelling in her lymph nodes and in her liver.\u00a0\u00a0All labs have come back and the mono and Epstein Barr was negative.\u00a0\u00a0All of her labs have come back normal with the exception of her T protein 8.8. Albumin 4.8, Globulin 4.0, ALT(SGPT)10, EO% 6.4, and BA% 03.\u00a0\u00a0All other test have come back within range.\u00a0\u00a0Her hemoglobin was at 13.7, MCH was 30.9, sed rate was 7, CO2 28.\u00a0\u00a0Those are the only numbers that really seemed close to a limit, everything else was mid range.\u00a0\u00a0 She was also tested for RA and that was negative.My daughter has missed 4 weeks of school already and is expected to be out until the first of January.\u00a0\u00a0Her appetite is good and her spirits are good, the only problem is that she is unable to do anything without being absolutely exhausted.\u00a0\u00a0Thirty minutes of movement requires an hour or more nap.\u00a0\u00a0She has no problem falling asleep at night and will sleep 12 hours with no problems.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor has her under observation with a re-evaluation in two weeks.Any suggestions at this point would be very helpful.Thanks",
