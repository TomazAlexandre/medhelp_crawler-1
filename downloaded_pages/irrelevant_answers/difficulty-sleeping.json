            "answer": "While you're waiting on a doctor to reply, I'll just throw out some things to consider. Yes, snoring of others in the household can be a real sleep buster.Diabetes is one possible cause of frequent nighttime urination. So is sleep apnea - has to do with the hormone ANP. You mention jumping up hearing your heart pounding as you fall asleep - Are you sure your poor sleep isn't related to some problems of your own, such as sleep apnea?Maybe a family appointment with a sleep doc wouldn't be a bad idea. =)",

            "answer": "Forgot to add that I had frequent bad dreams before being treated for sleep apnea. They stopped with CPAP treatment. My dreams always had something or someone either choking, drowning or suffocating. If your dreams have any kind of theme like that, add this to your symptoms that just COULD be a reason to investigate possible sleep apnea. I generally wouldn't place too much stocks in dreams, but in my case it was over a long period of time where I journaled 40+ such dreams - couldn't blame them all on pizza before bedtime.",
