            "answer": "I agree with the previous answer that other endocrine-related diseases such as Addison's can cause this. And type 1 folks are more likely to have other endocrine-related diseases because the immune disorder that causes type 1 diabetes can also cause problems with other endocrine glands. I would ask your doctor to test both the adrenal glands and the thyroid just to be on the safe side. My sister is also a type 1 (as am I) and she had Addison's. It is treatable, but only if diagnosed. Tests can show if you have this disease or other endocrine disorders, and all are treatable so you can live a normal life.",
