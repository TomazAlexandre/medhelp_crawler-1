            "answer": "Well of course you will feel washed out by just eating salads!To keep the body healthy you need a varied healthy diet.When your doctor told you to keep off all carbs, he probably meant to keep off cakes, biscuits, white bread, sweets, chocolates pastries and refined products.You need to eat a healthy and well balanced diet.\u00a0\u00a0The types of carbs that you should be eating are the ones that contain lots of fibre and not refined.\u00a0\u00a0With regard to fruit, portion sizes are important as with other types of food too.If you type in \"healthy plate\" in your web bar, you will get a picture of what a healthy plate should consist of.When you say you have stuck to salads, are you still eating meat, fish, some pulses, nuts? These are proteins.\u00a0\u00a0Salads are fine, but you need a variety of different foods for your body to stay well and healthy.Wheetabix, Shredded Wheat are high in fibre, as is porridge.\u00a0\u00a0A choice of one of those with some milk and a handful of soft fruit for example, is a healthy breakfast.Brown seeded bread for example is much better to have than a refined white bread.Even on this website there is information with regard to diabetes friendly recipes and lots of information on the web with regard to healthy eating and portion sizes.Ask your doctor to refer you to a dietician that specialises in diabetes.",
