    "question": "Hi,I am a 27 year old non diabetic with a family history of type II diabetes. I am overweight and have mild hypertension.I test my blood sugars regularly and my fasting sugars are normally below 5.I have been sick with a sinus infection for two weeks and was prescribed antibiotics and prednisone to fight the infection, took my first one at 4pm, ate dinner, and then at 11pm my sugar was 8.6. It has stayed at 7 this morning. The last time I tested was a week ago, and my fasting was 5.Could this be from the prednisone/being unwell? Seems odd that it would jump so much in a week.",
