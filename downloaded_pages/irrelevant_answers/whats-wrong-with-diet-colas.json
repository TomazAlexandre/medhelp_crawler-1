            "answer": "Drinking more than one soft drink a day seems to be associated with a substantially increased risk of heart disease, according to a study published last recently in the journal of the American Heart Association.It showed that in those who drink one or more soft drinks daily, there was an association of increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome.Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, including a bulging waistline, high blood pressure, low levels of good cholesterol, and high fasting glucose levels. Having three or more of these risk factors greatly increases the likelihood of contracting diabetes or suffering a heart attack.Those who drank one or more soft drinks a day were 48 percent more likely to have metabolic syndrome (which is defined as having three or more of the risk factors listed in the paragraph above) than those who don't indulge in soft drinks, the Framingham researchers said. They were 31 percent more likely to become obese; 25 percent more likely to develop high blood triglycerides, and 32 percent more likely to have low levels of good cholesterol.The most startling finding in the study was that it didn't seem to matter whether the soft drinks consumed were the regular sugary drinks, or diet sodas.Hope this helps....Jon",
