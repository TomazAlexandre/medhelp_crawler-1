            "answer": "The only side affects i ever had from metformin was stomach problems if I didn't stick to my diet in the first 2 weeks. It would cause stomach cramps, bloating and diarrhea. After the first 2 weeks were over, things went into place and I never had any issues again with it. Birth control can sometimes cause weight gain...but not every woman is the same. I never had weight gain with Yasmin. Sleepiness is not a side affect of metformin. And also, not every woman who has PCOS has diabetes. As far has the birth control, it did lighten my period and made it shorter as well. I never had breakthrough bleeding with it. My body reacts to medications very well...I've never had any bad side affects from anything I took.",

            "answer": "I have chosen to not take either meds, but the common symptoms with Metformin are stomach upset problems. I believe these usually last for a couple of weeks until your body adjusts. You'll experience a larger stomach upset if you eat a good that is high in carbs and sugar, so be careful or you might be glued to the toilet for a while!I haven't done much research on Yaz myself but from what I've read, weight gain, bloating and fatigue are common symptoms with Yaz. HTH!",

    "question": "This is my first week on these two medications. I was told that I have PCOS a week ago. I was wondering what side effects you have had from these drugs. Over the past year, I have gained 50 pounds by changing nothing at all. This gain happened while I was doing 1.5 hr cardio a day with weights & eating around 800 calories. (5'4, 160 now). My Dr. told me that Metformin would help with lowering my weight.Yet, I'm now on Yaz. Yaz has been said to cause weight gain in some girls (maybe just from the horrible intense cravings). I'm just very curious of what I can expect with these two drugs. I am well aware that everyone has different reactions to different medications, especially medications dealing with hormones.What have these drugs done for you?So far I have had only effects from Metformin (750mg 2x a day).These have been:dizziness, sleepiness, headaches--obviously this should be expected though --it messing with blood sugar and all.P.S.--I'm no diabetic also.",
