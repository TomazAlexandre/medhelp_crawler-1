            "answer": "Age, level of physical training/fitness, any post-op complications such as wound infections etc..., obesity and other medical problems such as diabetes all play a role in the healing process.\u00a0\u00a0Usually we tell patients to take it easy for about 6-8 weeks postop and then re-evaluate them when they return for\u00a0\u00a0followup at the end of that time.\u00a0\u00a0If everything looks ok (physical exam, followup imaging studies as needed), then the patients can GRADUALLY ease back into their normal routine at work, at play, and with intimate situations.\u00a0\u00a0This means if you\u00a0\u00a0were ok at your followup, then go ahead and start doing what you were before, but gradually.\u00a0\u00a0Non-weight bearing or non-contact sports like golf should be ok.\u00a0\u00a0LIsten to your body.\u00a0\u00a0If it starts to hurt or you experience neurological problems like numbness or weakness with activities, then stop or slow down. As for football which can be a pretty rough sport, you'll have to talk to your surgeon.The plates do help stabilize the spine, and you still have the vertebra or bones of the spine there.\u00a0\u00a0The discs were probably what were removed and then the bones were fused for greater stability.\u00a0\u00a0For more specific information, talk to your surgeon who is familiar with your case. Good luck.",

            "answer": "Hi - if they take away a disc what is in its place, is it not just bone grinding against bone.I have one cervical rib higher than the other, it interferes with the collarbone but most of the pain is at the back of the neck. On the x-ray it looks as if the extra ribs are on C5, not C7 where I thought they would be, but maybe I'm counting them wrongly, they are'nt very good x-rays and completely miss T1 with a shadow effect. My left shoulder is lower than my right, I can feel the rib more prominently on my right than my left. The collar-bone aches all the time, the rib on the right can be felt and moves when I swallow, I swallow better when I tuck my chin under. Also the top verts where the neck meets the head is always sore. The shooting pains are the worst. Maybe osteophytes trapping nerves. I have a curvature. If they go in to decompress will they maybe fuse the weak area with plates to stabilize that area, especially if they decide to take away a rib or 2.Once you've had a fusion is it true that you can't have another MRI because of the metal.Will a decompression reverse the damage already done to my left hand and stop the damage starting in my right hand, or is the most I can hope for that they wn't be any further damage.I'm at least 3 months away from seeing a neurologist.",
