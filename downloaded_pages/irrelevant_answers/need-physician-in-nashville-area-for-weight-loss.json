I know how it is to want to lose weight and not being able to. ***.com really helped me.",

If you want to be successful, check out the website at altmedofthetriad.com or call them at *******.\u00a0\u00a0They can mail your supplies to you and you won't be sorry!\u00a0\u00a0Oh, tell them you heard about them from Michelle.\u00a0\u00a0They give you referral points for each person you refer...I may get a free treatment, detox foot bath, massage, injection, or discount on a service for a referral.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck Bonnie615 this stuff works and you won't be disappointed!",

    "question": "Until today, I did not know that there were ANY weight loss drugs in use aside from Meridia and Xenical (now alli OTC.)I am insterested in learning more about my options, but would like to consult a physician as well.I just learned about HCG.\u00a0\u00a0I did not know doctors were still prescribing phentermine or phendimetrazine.I am morbidly obese and have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I am also infertile due to PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0My weight has been a burden for a long time and I must find something that will stick.\u00a0\u00a0(I usually struggle tremendously to just lose 8-10 pounds and give up.)The way I see it, I have to calculate the risks.\u00a0\u00a0What is the risk of staying at my current weight?\u00a0\u00a0I am 35 and would like a long healthy life ahead of me.Thanks!(Note to fightu:\u00a0\u00a0I have just joined this forum today.\u00a0\u00a0I see that you are very passionately campaigning against diet drugs.\u00a0\u00a0I just wanted to let you know that the repetitive messages, angry tone and impression of \"ranting\" have greatly discredited any information you provide.\u00a0\u00a0This is actually very unfortunate, because if anything you include is factual, it would be valuable for people to read.\u00a0\u00a0Please consider approaching your \"crusade\" from a more rational standpoint.\u00a0\u00a0You may find that you can genuinely help people.)",
