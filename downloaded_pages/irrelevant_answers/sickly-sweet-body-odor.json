            "answer": "I had a friend who was an alcoholic. At first I did not know of her addiction. She had the loveliest sweet smell that was personal and had nothing to do with perfume. I guess the smell was related to her alcoholism. I'm sorry your husband doesn't smell better. Maybe it has to do with the kind of alcohol they drink.",
