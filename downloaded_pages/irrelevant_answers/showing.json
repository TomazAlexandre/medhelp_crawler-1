    "question": "I'm a tiny girl, about 4\"10 and began pregnancy at 104lbs. I am now 4 months pregnant and at 111 lbs, it doesn't seem like much weight gain but my stomach is REALLY big for 4 months. Everyone's telling me to get checked for gestational diabetes or \"slow down eating\" when I really don't even eat that much. Is this normal because of my size ?",
