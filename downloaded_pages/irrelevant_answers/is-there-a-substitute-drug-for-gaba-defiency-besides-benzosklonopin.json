            "answer": "Namaste,I don't know your new haelthcare provider would want to take you off of Klonopin if it has been working for you so well. Did you ask her?You have a right to know why a doctor is developing a specific treatment plan for you and you should have the appropriate input to that plan.As for weaning yoursellf off of Klonopin, I feel it's premature to even consider this since your provider hasn't(apparently) told you what, if any medication, she is going to prescribe for you.As for GABA. Gamma-aminobutyric acid functions as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, decreasing neuron activity thus preventing them from overfiring. With niacinamide (B3) and inositol, GABA prevents anxiety and stress-related messages from reaching the motor centers of the brain, and is essential for brain metabolism.Supplements can be obtained at almost every health store (i.e. GNC, The Vitamin Shoppe, etc.) although it's absorbtion into your system depends on the means of administration.I would not start taking GABA, however, without discussing it with your healthcare provider. Some \"natural\" supplements can interfere with or interact negatively with prescribed medications.This information is intended to supplement, not substitute for, the expertise and judgment of your physician, pharmacist or other healthcare professional.",

I feel like it is just a bandaid on a serious situation.",

            "answer": "I'm on my 3rd day of decreasing my 3mg Klonopin dose to 2 mg. I guess its because I'm leaving the state soon and am not sure how soon I will get a new med plan or new shrink.(The old one as I've said previously wants me to be weaned off of it.So this is my experiment) I tame .5mg when I awaken an the other .5 doses 3 more times during the day. My sleep seems the most different> I still get to sleep ok but awaken more easily. Strangle the sleep quality seems better. More of a deeper more comfy sleep.I honestly cannot tell if when I awake every morning that the visceral jitters are a result of comming off the drug or my alleged GABA defiency awakening.",

    "question": "Hi I'm a 45 year old male with a history of\u00a0\u00a0drug use alcoholism depression and anxiety.6 years ago i was diagnosed with diabetes and stooped drinking beer, as my diabetes was under control (and now is 'gone' due to weight loss) on weekend i drank 5 large bottles of wine. The following Monday I noticed i was shaking inside.which ive never experienced before. so i went to my Dr. and they put me on .25 mg of Xanax . Another Dr. put me on 300mg of Trazadone which did nothing as did Proxac.I went to a psychologist who determined that my problem was physical and sent me to a Pcyc. He put me on 1mg of Klonopin 3 times daily, in which I found instant relief. Iv'e been on this for 5 years now .My Psyc Dr retired and was replaced by a young lady Dr that wants to take me off Klonopin.My original Psyc told me I probably had a GABA defiency from my years of meth use. Which makes sence. My sister is on Xanax, my 8 years old niece is on Topamax.We seem to have a possible family history of some defiency.I am soon to get a new medical plan and have enough Klonopin for 3 months.Should i start weaning myself off Klonopin? I wake up every single morning , eyes WIDE open and feeling like i did a line of meth.I don't abuse drugs anymore and my wine drinkng has tapered off drastically.I'm hoping my new Dr. will keep me on it, Are there anyother non-benzo drugs that correct a GABA defiency?The last Psyc lady thati saw would not even comment on this.She was determined to wean me off of it and said since i was drinking that I was at risk for seizures...Klonopin has worked for me all theses years.Thank you.",
