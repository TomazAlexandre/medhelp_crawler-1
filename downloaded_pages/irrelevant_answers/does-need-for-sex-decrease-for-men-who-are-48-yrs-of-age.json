    "question": "I am wondering what to do with my bf who is 48 years old and having difficulty staying erect.\u00a0\u00a0Our sex life was great but lately since the last year he wants it less and when we do have sex it has not been so great.\u00a0\u00a0This started when we decided to live apart and now we have our own place.\u00a0\u00a0This is his first time living alone in 26 years of being together.\u00a0\u00a0I wonder if when we were together and when he cheated ( not that he would ever admit it but I know better) that he was capable of having sex.\u00a0\u00a0We both still see each other but our sex life *****.\u00a0\u00a0I have not a prude and enjoy having naughty sex which he well knows.\u00a0\u00a0Im 120ilbs 34D 25 32 5'4 and 45 even though I pass for 32 since I am asian the problem is that I have not given up on him and well need more sex then he is giving me for the last 6 months.I know he is not seeing anyone and tells me the only thing he would want is to have NSA but has not. I believe since we dont live together he has on occasion paid women from backpage but wont admit to it.Would this cause him to have erection problems when we attempt having sex?\u00a0\u00a0I cant help but wonder why since if he was indeed getting to find out what it is like to have sex with other women that it is not benefiting me since I secretly am turned on fantasying him with another women.\u00a0\u00a0Yes I have actually tried initiating a threesome but he chickens out???\u00a0\u00a0SO here I am wanting to be satisfied and tired of masturbating.\u00a0\u00a0Is it because he feels guilty or because of age or what.I hope someone can give me some insight.\u00a0\u00a0BTW yes I know the easy way of solving my problem is calling my male friends for a booty call but I really dont want to since I am worried that having sex with someone else as thrilling as it sounds might be disappointing and then what?This discussion is related to/posts/show/614991.",
