            "answer": "Zeffect:Hi.\u00a0\u00a0No, you're not boring, the problem is you're too ~interesting.~Your case is so complicated that most people don't answer due to not knowing about all of your conditions.I don't know about all your conditions either, but I recognize a pattern.Your various problems resemble someone who has tick borne infection.Lyme Disease is known to cause fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, neuropathy, and depression.Most people know that Lyme can cause arthritis, but it also can cause neurogenic bladder.I'm not particularly informed about spinal pathology,\u00a0\u00a0however, many people on the support group at LymeNet.org have disc problems.There is something about Lyme that seems to cause joint and back problems.I don't know if it is due to the Lyme bacteria itself, or because of the metabolic changes it causes.BTW, desiccation means to dry out.If your discs were described as desiccated, it may be that they were thinner than normal.Wishing you the best,Carol",

            "answer": "Thanks for the info, however, I live in Florida, and have not been exposed to Lyme Disease. Where I live there aren't any cases of Lyme Disease. Also, I'm disabled, and I barely ever go outside because it is incredibly humid and hot here and I can't stand the heat. There are no woods around me, or any type of animals that could potentially carry this deer tick. The chance that I acquired Lyme Disease is slim to none, and I have never found any type of 'bullet' mark on my body. However, I am definitely going to go to the site you specified and see what I can learn. Thank you so much for answering my post - having health problems can be at times a lonely road to travel on alone.",

    "question": "I had an MRI done of all regions of my spine, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar. It showed 14 discs\u00a0\u00a0were mild to moderately herniated, and 3 areas were described as dessicated. I cannot find any information on what dessication means. Also, wouldn't it be considered significant if a person had 14 discs that were not normal? I have chronic neck (3 herniations in my neck), back and leg pain since back surgery @ L3, L4, I have Fibromyalgia, Type II Diabetes (injectable insulin 4 x/day), Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Neurogenic Bladder from Anesthesia, Arthritis, (B) Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Neuropathy, and Depression. My Physician discussed each disc individually, and said that seperately, they are not so bad - I said that all 14 herniations belong to one person's back, and cumulativally, wouldn't that explain my chronic back pain, especially my neck? I have to hold up my neck with a neck pillow at all times. I am 43 years old and am permanently disabled.",
