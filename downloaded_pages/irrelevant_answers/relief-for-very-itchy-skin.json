            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin that isn't accompanied by other obvious skin changes, such as a rash, is most often caused by dry skin (xerosis). Other conditions like psoriasis,dermatitis and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy skin.She can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used.She should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching.She should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Pls take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch.Lastly,Phototherapy can also be tried.Hope it helps. Take care and pls do keep me posted if you have any additional queries.",

    "question": "Any suggestions for a woman who is 101 yrs old and has extremely itchy skin especially on back, neck, chest, arms. She has been to dermatologist numerous times and everyone seems to be stumped. Her skin does not appear to be overly dry except on her face and ears. She does not have any rashes. The only skin abrasions are where she has scratched herself. This little lady is in misery. She has lotion put on her body everyday after her bath, but not on her face...that's why I noticed it was so dry. The only medication she takes is for her thyroid, which she has taken for many years. She is mentally alert but she cannot hear at all (due to age) and she can still walk but uses a wheelchair also. She doesn't take vitamins or food supplements. Help, please.",
