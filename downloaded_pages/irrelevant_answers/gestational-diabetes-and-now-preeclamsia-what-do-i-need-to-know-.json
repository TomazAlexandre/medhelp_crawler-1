I got a cerclage aat 19 weeks and my cervix is 1cm sometimes shorter. I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes weeks ago. My blood pressure wstarted going up 2 weeks ago, I did all the blood test and they are normal. Yesterday I did the 24 hours urine collection and protein was found in my urine. I was told today that the perinatal doctors will come talk to me about when to have the baby. Am currently 31 weeks and 3 days. Is there any one that has been in this situation? What was the outcome? Is my baby going to be fine am worried.",
