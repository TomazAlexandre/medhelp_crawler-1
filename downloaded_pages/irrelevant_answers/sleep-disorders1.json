            "answer": "You have insomnia.A Harvard study in 2004 demonstrated medications are not the best treatment for insomnia, but rather Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi) is better.\u00a0\u00a0CBTi is safe in the long term, is less expensive, has no side effects, and treats insomnia at the root cause instead of just trying to \"knock someone out\" like medications do.\u00a0\u00a0If you go see a sleep doctor in person, CBTi is what they will recommend.\u00a0\u00a0Alternatively, online programs have been found to be equally effective and less expensive.Rest well!",
