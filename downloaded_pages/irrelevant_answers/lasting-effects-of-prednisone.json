            "answer": "\"I take glucophage twice a day\"The reason for this is you're diabetic? Or to counter-act the Prednisone?In a person with type 2 diabetes, Prednisone may cause a rise in blood sugar. You weren't on Prednisone for very long so, as Caregiver said, everything will come back to what it was.I would suggest monitoring the blood sugar more frequently and follow diabetes nutritional guidelines. Insulin is the very last option so don't get overly concerned prematurely.",

    "question": "I recently was administered Prednisone over a 10 day period, 20mg.\u00a0\u00a0Prior to taking the Prednisone my blood sugar levels were good, within the normal range.\u00a0\u00a0I find that now that I have been weaned off the Prednisone, approximately fifteen days now, my blood sugar readings have not returned to the normal range as prior to taking the Prednisone. I am within an acceptable weight range and exercise 45 minutes every day.\u00a0\u00a0I am distressed over this turn of events and am perplexed as to whether I will ever regain the good readings I previously had or now have to do something more drastic.\u00a0\u00a0By the way I take glucophage twice a day, and do not want to have begin taking insulin.",
