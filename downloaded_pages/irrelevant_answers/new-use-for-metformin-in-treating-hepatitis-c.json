    "question": "I'm surprised to see this, as all we hear about these days are STAT-C's. Talk about coming from a different direction.I'm curious to hear your reaction and know some of you take Metformin for diabetes.I recall making a comment about Metformin on a lively, old thread but with the benefit of hindsight, that comment now seems inappropriate. Anyway, that thread may have gone the way of some our lively threads. :)New Use for Old Drugs in Treating Hepatitis CResearch led by the University of Leeds has found drugs such as anti-diabetic drug Metformin and AICAR, used to combat obesity, can prevent the hepatitis C virus from replicating in the body. Hepatitis C virus affectsan estimated three per cent of the world\u2019s population and there are four million carriers of the virus in Europe alone. The virus affects the liver and recovery rates are low: only around 40 % of hepatitis C sufferers will fullyrecover, with others developing cirrhosis and in many cases, liver cancer.\u201cWe\u2019re very excited about these findings,\u201d said Professor Mark Harris from the University\u2019s Faculty of Biological Sciences. \u201cThese drugs are already on the market, and whilst substantial clinical trials still need to take place before they can be used to treat hepatitis C infection, we think it could be an enormous step forward in the battle against the virus.\u201dThe research was supported by the Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.Drugs such as Metformin and AICAR work by stimulating an enzyme called AMP kinase (AMPK) which regulates energy within our cells \u2013 the very enzyme that hepatitis C virus represses to enable it to replicate. \u201cYou\u2019d expect AMPK to be activated when a cell becomes infected by a virus, because it would sense the increase in energy required to enable the virus to replicate. In such cases, AMPK would shut down certain functions of the cell temporarily until the cell\u2019s energy is rebalanced,\u201d said Professor Harris. \u201cWe found that hepatitis C virus, because it needs lipids and membranes, causes the opposite to happen.\u201dBuilding on this finding, the research team were able to examine how cells would react when treated with common drugs that stimulate AMPK. They found that in infected cells, the drugs were able to halt virus replication, enabling cells to clear the infection. A patent has been filed on the discovery and the team will shortly embark on a smallscale clinical trial with the University of Nottingham to provide a greater evidence base upon which future clinical trials can be based.http://www.labmate-online.com/news/news-and-views/5/news/new_use_for_old_drugs_in_treating_hepatitis_c/11108/",
