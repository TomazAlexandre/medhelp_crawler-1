            "answer": "I've been experiencing chronic lightheadedness with my anxiety for eight months now. It's extremely scary and uncomfortable sometimes. I have visual disorientation, like when I move my head, my vision doesn't follow quite right, like my eyes are half a second behind my head movements. All I can say is to hang in there and try to stay busy. When you're busy, it takes your mind off of the lightheadedness.",
