            "answer": "There can be many reasons for amenorreah. I am not a doctor and not familiar with the link between high blood sugars and amenorrhea.\u00a0\u00a0I would recommend seeing a gynecologist or your regular physician for a complete physical to rule out hormonal or other reasons that your period may have stopped. I do know that periods can stop if you have lost a significant amount of weight and/or are exercising more than may be good for your body.\u00a0\u00a0Today there is such an emphasis on being thin, particularly for young women. Your body needs a certain amount of weight in order to be functioning fully.\u00a0\u00a0When you have diabetes, it is natural to be concerned about the food you eat and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to discuss these issues with your physician or dietician to make sure your getting enough food to maintain your health. If this turns out to be the cause of your amenorrhea, it is certainly reversible.At any rate, a doctor's visit is in order to find out the cause. Good luck!",

            "answer": "Yes I have been to my Gyn. All tests came back normal. I had a few other issues at the same time my peiod stopped:1) new STRESSFUL job2) Big calorie consumption decrease3) Stopped a Work out supplement containing Ephedra.I did not lose a dramatic amount of weight, just mantained myself as usual.Its really mind boggling, It has been 5 months now and the last thing I could come up with was high blood sugar causing this. I know of a lot of women that have experienced this and are NON diabetic and have been put on Glucophage just to regulate their Bsugar levels.",

            "answer": "Cinnabon,A few thoughts come to mind.\u00a0\u00a0The workout supplement may well have \"messed\" with your already stressed endocrine system.\u00a0\u00a0It may take a while for your natural rhythms to come back.If you're in your 30s or 40s, you may be experiencing peri-menopause.\u00a0\u00a0Not menopause (the end of periods), but the period of time before that (sometimes lasting 10, 15 or more years).\u00a0\u00a0There are lots of books on the subject and you might recognize other peri-menopausal symptoms.Since our endocrine systems are a bit out of whack - due to diabetes - it's not uncommon that other hormone-balancing processes might not be working well.\u00a0\u00a0Whatever you can do to regain reasonable DM control will help.\u00a0\u00a0I know you know that and I also know it's easier to say than to do.Finally, stress.\u00a0\u00a0Stress has a HUGE impact on my DM management and really difficult times almost always lead to higher BGs for me.\u00a0\u00a0That, in turn, stresses me.\u00a0\u00a0<sigh>\u00a0\u00a0If you can find just one way to nurture yourself instead of potentially punishing yourself through the stress, you might find a way to break the cycle.Do talk with your doc, of course, since this is apparently a significant change from your normal self.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

            "answer": "I agree with LRS.One other thing to consider is whether your diet actually contains enough calories, given the intensity of your workout routine.I saw your diet below.\u00a0\u00a0You didn't mention your starting weight or your height.\u00a0\u00a0If you are a very large woman, you may need a higher caloric intake than what you described.\u00a0\u00a0If this is a very drastic dietary change for you, your body may respond with irregular periods for a while until you become accustomed to it.Good luck!",
