            "answer": "I've been a type 2 diabetic for over 3 years.\u00a0\u00a0It crept up slowly on me, but when my A1C broke through 7.0, I was given 90 days to see a significant drift downward, or begin a drug therapy. I immediately began a paleo style diet.\u00a0\u00a0I refused to eat anything containing \"white\"; bread, sugar, rice, potatoes, pasta...PASTA!!.\u00a0\u00a0I also shunned grains of any kind like rolled oats, wheat.\u00a0\u00a0Also out were honey, most fruits, lots of types of beans, peas, and corn.\u00a0\u00a0All fruit juices were banished.\u00a0\u00a0Do you realize how many oranges you must consume to yield a large glass of orange juice?\u00a0\u00a0What I began to eat were lots of eggs, cheese, fish and meats, big salads with olive oil and vinegar with crumbled up feta cheese and hardboiled eggs, and sunflower seeds.\u00a0\u00a0Nuts became my \"candy\".\u00a0\u00a0What was once a steady \"drip\" of M&M's was now peanuts, almonds, walnuts, cashews, and pecans.\u00a0\u00a0I estimate I consume over 30 pounds of nuts annually. I began to looked at product labeling and replacing anything product loaded with carbohydrates.\u00a0\u00a0I began to know what and what not to pick up.\u00a0\u00a0I had also bought a meter and began testing all throughout the day, and graphed it using an app on my smart phone.\u00a0\u00a0I could clearly see I was doing something positive, but the proof would be in the A1C.\u00a0\u00a0I dutifully took the test on the 90th day and waiting for the results.\u00a0\u00a0I swear my physician was just waiting to write the Rx for Metformin when he opened my patient folder.\u00a0\u00a0He almost seemed disappointed when he told me my A1C was down to 6.0.\u00a0\u00a0A follow up test was 5.7, and that's where I seemed to level off. and where it remains 3+ years later.\u00a0\u00a0Along with my diet I exercise a lot.\u00a0\u00a0I walk daily, and coach a speed skating team at a local rink as I used to skate competitively.After 3 years, I began to reintroduce a lunchtime sandwich made with low carb bread.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed that giving my body a chance to rest also made it respond better to occasional ingestion of carbohydrates.\u00a0\u00a0Rather than sticking to an internet diet, or calculating glycemic index of a potential food, I just chose to avoid anything with a high carbohydrate weight per serving.\u00a0\u00a0That stuff was my personal kryptonite and I just steered clear of it.\u00a0\u00a0Last year I added strawberries and blueberries to my lunch.\u00a0\u00a0I eat them in season just as ancient gatherers would have done. Carbohydrates were seasonal treats; honey, berries, and other fruits were consumed on a seasonal basis.\u00a0\u00a0It wasn't a constant stream of carb laden food. Diet control worked for me, although I suspect others will get varied results. I fully recognize that I will always be a type 2 diabetic, and it's a slippery slope if you get caught on it enjoying stuff you know isn't on the list.\u00a0\u00a0But I've managed 3 years on the low carb wagon with only an occasional treat here and there.\u00a0\u00a0I think the key to my success was while I loved things like rice with a big pat of butter, or angle hair pasta with fresh garlic and olive oil, I also really dug cheese, and nuts, and dried sausages.\u00a0\u00a0The new diet really wasn't that bad.\u00a0\u00a0Try it and see, you've got nothing to lose.\u00a0\u00a0If it doesn't work for you, you've obviously have other options.\u00a0\u00a0But GET A METER and test, and exercise like you're life depends on it.",
