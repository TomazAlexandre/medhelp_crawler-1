            "answer": "Being pre-diabetic is the perfect time to prevent yourself from developing diabetes thru diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor should have suggested this first before putting you on medication.\u00a0\u00a0Even once you become diabetic...diet and exercise is very important.\u00a0\u00a0If your numbers are high on medication, I doubt they will improve when off the medication.\u00a0\u00a0I would find an Endocrinologist and start over with this, it can be determined thru blood tests if you can try to reverse this with diet and exercise, but I think your current doctor jumped the gun on giving you medication so quickly.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, the medication is not controlling your sugar and that needs to be addressed. I would just start fresh with an Endo and go from there.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you all the best!",

            "answer": "My fasting numbers are ok. This has been my numbers 2 hours after meals.1st test (prior to medication): 122.2nd test (2 months after started medication): 1983rd test (with medication): 155. This 3rd test was done one year after the first test. In that year I lost 40lbs, exercised, ate healthy and took my medication.Why did my numbers worsen after a year of medication, exercise and healthy food?The 122 was measured with no medication, the 155 was measure while I was taking medication.I asked myself the same thing, Why would I have to take medication if I had prediabetes?Could the medication have worsened my situation? Now it seems I cannot stop medication because I feel bad (frequent urination, thirst, hunger)",

            "answer": "The bad thing is that after a whole year of exercising, eating healthy and taking medication. My doctor told me I could quit the med, and it was impossible. (I began urinating frequently, extremely thirsty and hungry, felt like my body wasn\u00b4t absorbing the food). And had to go back to medication.In my answer above to heartfluttersflyawayplz there are my test results.I am measuring my glucose daily and the weirdest thing is that I am getting glucose numbers around 70 two hours after meals, when at lab I got 150.I just want to do the test without medication interfering the results. At what time should I take the medication the day before for it not to interfere with results?",

            "answer": "Hi,your fasting should ideally be between 70 - 100.\u00a0\u00a0Over 126 and your meds are not working well enough.2 hours after eating your numbers should be < 120.If your numbers are higher than these numbers you need a change in meds.Have they tested your HA1C?\u00a0\u00a0If not, please get it tested.\u00a0\u00a0This test gives an average of your blood sugars over approx. the last 3 months.Home meters can sometimes not be so accurate, or maybe it needs recalibration.\u00a0\u00a0Definiltey would recommend to do some further checkup to make sure numbers are really ok.",

            "answer": "When I was diagnosed with diabetes on my 40th birthday, 17 years ago; I was told that 140 fasting, was the cut-off for being diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0The medical community has since lowered that number and now your fasting blood glucose levels should not be over 100.The doctor I have now, tells me that two hours after meals, should not be any higher than 120-135.\u00a0\u00a0That's MY doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Other doctor's may say something else.If you really feel that your levels are higher since you started Metformin, tell your doctor the way you feel.\u00a0\u00a0He/she should be more than willing to talk things over with you.As Sally says, you should have A1C testing done to show them what your levels have averaged over the past 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0If your diabetes is under control, (the United States averages, that is) the doctor's will tell you, 6 and below is the number you should strive for.If you want your testing done without your medication, tell your doctor that.\u00a0\u00a0They may say to discontinue the meds for a few days and test then.\u00a0\u00a0I really believe though that you are going to find your levels go way too high.\u00a0\u00a0If you levels are higher than normal on Metformin, then it could be you need another medication (which would be rare) and if your levels are too high and not controlled with diet, exercise and Metformin, then it's time to get on insulin.Good luck to you.\u00a0\u00a0Once you get everything regulated, living with diabetes is not all that bad.\u00a0\u00a0Just takes some adjustments in lifestyle and medication, to keep yourself healthy.",

            "answer": "Yes, the numbers for diagnosing are confusing. My lab sets 140 (two hours after meals) as lower limit.My fasting numbers are ok. My problem is when I eat, that my sugar and insulin numbers raise too much.I had an A1C testing and it was 5,7 which is below 6. The thing is that the A1C measures the past 3 months in which I took the medication. And I wanted to know my numbers without medication.Even though my A1C is ok, yesterday my glucose level was 162 two hours after a meal (with medication). I wish I could know what a 162 glucose level (having taken 500mg of metformin) is equivalent to, if I hadn\u00b4t taken the medication.",

    "question": "I was told I was pre-diabetic a year ago and my doctor prescribed medication (metformin). Since then, all the tests I have done have been while on medication. I want to know what my real numbers are now and do not want the medication to lower my numbers, but show the real tolerance my body has to glucose without any aid. .What I mean is that a year ago I was prediabetic (with no meds), and right now my numbers show prediabetes (with medication). I do not know if that means that I would be diabetic if I didn\u00b4t take the medication.The thing is that next test I want to find out if I am really diabetic, I do not want to keep on measuring the effectiveness of metformin (medication) but find out if I developed or not diabetes.At what time should I take metformin the day before, for it not to effect glucose values?Am I prediabetic or diabetic right now?",
