    "question": "I had my biopsy yesterday, I was scared to death and ended up taking a Xanax before the procedure, thankfully the doctor was extremely good looking and very gentle, he knew of my concerns and handled himself very well, he talked his way through the \"bee stings\" of the numbing medication and I didn't feel a thing! IT was a breeze, I did feel some pressure, but that was expected, but over all I wouldn't be afraid to do it again. I take Xanax for a panic disorder and I am on the lowest dosage available so I think it helped me relax some, but when I get really nervous I talk ALOT and move my feet! I have a tumor that is 5mm, he took 3 tissue samples from around the tumor area, the clicking sound of the thing that they take samples with made me jump the first time because it was faster than 3 seconds that he told me it would be, but it didn't hurt! I have type 2 diabetes, asthma, IBS, overweight, a blood clotting disorder, and I take alot of medications, my concerns were since this was an invasive procedure if I would have to quit taking my meds, the only med I had to quit taking was my coumadin 3 days prior, at first I was really scared, I have been on coumadin for 3 years and I am a \"lifer\", I felt like I didn't want to free fall without my safety net, but my Anticoagulation Clinic told me that my risk factors were slim and I will be fine, but to start taking my coumadin again that night after my biopsy. Well the doctor who did the biopsy told me that the usual protocol was to wait 48 hours before resuming the coumadin, I explained to him that I had been off of it for 3 days and was really afraid to go any longer since I have a history of producing big clots! He thought it over and said that if I stayed up late to watch the news then it will be fine to start my coumadin again, well that is what I did! Today (yesterday was my biopsy) I am finding out that its a little more SORE than it was yesterday, the lidocain lasted most of the night, but today is a different story...OUCH! There is some pain and swelling and bruising, which is normal, but to get up and walk and let those watermelons hang down...OUCH so I decided to keep my bindings on for most of the day and the ice REALLY helps...I will find out the test results tomorrow, I pray they are benign, but if they aren't then I will deal with it, I will post my results.",
