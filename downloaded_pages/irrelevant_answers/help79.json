            "answer": "I had the same problem. I'm 38+6 and still have it. Apparently it's normal for some women. Our senses are stronger and it could be our bodies telling us that those food choices are not good for us. The few times I have eaten meat it had to be almost burnt for me to even consider eating it. I have a total aversion to pork. Chkn can only be fried and I still probably won't eat it, and beef always is well done. It's very frustrating. I mostly just eat side items.Make sure you're taking your pre natals, load up on veggies when you can and eat nuts and beans at least to get protein etc.As far as water, maybe adding a few slices of fresh fruit will favor it enough for you to drink it better.",
