            "answer": "Hardly. Symptoms DO NOT mean a pregnancy is viable--in fact symptoms mean nothing at all. It's the reaction a female has to the pregnancy, nothing more. I've been pregnant twice, miscarried one. My first with my daughter I had nausea/vomiting, sore breasts and fatigue. My second I had BAD fatigue and nausea/vomiting--this is the one I lost. They 'claim' that nausea/vomiting indicates a strong pregnancy and this is untrue.I've seen many women with every symptom on the planet and lose it, while others with none go full term. Ignore it and enjoy your pregnancy. Many women would love to be symptom free--I know I would have given anything to not vomit everyday for 9 months.",
