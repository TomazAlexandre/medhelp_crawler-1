            "answer": "Hello,First and foremost is the possibility of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce adequate levels of hormones. It can cause all the symptoms that you are having.Then other possibilities are of abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, vit B 12or sodium in your body, diabetes, stroke,transient ischemic attacks,lupus or multiple sclerosis.You can take multivitamins for some time. Also get your blood sugar and thyroid hormone levels tested.If your thyroid levels are low as I suspect hypothyroidism strongly,pls consult an endocrinologist and start with the treatment.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep us posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I've recently been laid off and have no insurance. I cannot afford to go to the doctor otherwise. I have been experiencing strange symptoms lately, from what I don't know. I've been becoming dizzy when I stand up (not always but sometimes). I can still bike for over an hour without feeling faint in the slightest. At night when I hold up a book to read, my wrists and hands become numb so that I have to set the book down. I don't have carpal tunnel. My stool has dark areas. I haven't had my period yet this month and I've never been late--ever. Normally I have swelling and tenderness of the entire breast for a week before my period arrives...I haven't had that yet. Three home pregnancy tests have told me I'm not pregnant. I also discovered a cavity that wasn't there mere days ago. Also, my nails have small ridges on them and the other day (I was biting my nails, ahem) and a huge chunk of nail just sloughed off to the point that I had to wear a band-aid. I'm concerned that something serious might be happening. I thought it might be malnutrition or a hemorrhage or anemia, but I eat very healthily, so I started taking a multivitamin. These symptoms have only been in the last week and a half or so.",
