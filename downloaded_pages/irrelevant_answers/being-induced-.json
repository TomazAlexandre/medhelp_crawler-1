            "answer": "Okay when I got induced I was 38 weeks. Bubz was not ready to come lol it took 3 days for him to finally make his way out! 1st day they put gel in my vagina to help soften cervix (didn't work) next day they put a pill up there (no progress that day) 3rd day they were able to break my waters at 9 am.\u00a0\u00a0At 12 they pumped me with pitocin and at 3 he was born! Inductions are typically faster because the pitocin is pretty much making your body have contractions although the contractions are far more worse. I had no pain relief whatsoever, if u can do it so can you!! Good luck babe. Ask as much questions if you need advice xx",
