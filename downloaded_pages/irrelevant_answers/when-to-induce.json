    "question": "Doctor changed my due date a week later at first ultrasound, she did this with my first born as well and that extra time in pregnancy brought on preeclampsia and a near death experience losing 40% of my blood, this was nine years ago. I'm now 28 and want to suggest going with the date given based on my last period. She said due to complications she wouldn't let me go passed my due date but I want that to be the original one. Will a week at full term make that much of a difference for baby? When I'm closer I'm going to push myself to go into labor naturally but in case this ones as stubborn as the first... Appointment Friday and would love some input for how to approach my doctor about this.",
