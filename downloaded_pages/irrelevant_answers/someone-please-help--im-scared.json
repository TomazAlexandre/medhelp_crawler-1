            "answer": "Your pain could be kidney stones, for they are excruciating. They can be diagnosed by tests. As for the tired feelings after eating, this COULD be reactive hypoglycemia. Do a Google search on reactive hypoglcyemia and you will find lots of info. You probably also can find some diet suggestions that might help you if this is happening to you. The dizzy feeling could very well be low blood sugar. I agree with JDRF-Team-gg that you need to be seen by a doctor. Getting hypoglycemic when driving can be fatal... a caring parent certainly doesn't want a family member driving while dizzy.If you had blood tests, the doctor probably had your glucose levels checked, which would rule out diabetes. But it may not rule out reactive hypoglcyemia, for the only way this would show up in routine bloodwork would be if your blood was drawn while you were having one of these spells. See if drinking a little juice (a half cup to a cup, but\u00a0\u00a0no more) helps the dizzy feeling. If so, you should feel better in about 15 minutes to a half hour after drinking the juice.",

    "question": "For the past few weeks I've felt really tired and dizzy, especially after eating lunch or eating too much.\u00a0\u00a0It hurts when I pee, sometimes, and I have found my self very uncoordinated lately, like my muscles are slacking off.\u00a0\u00a0Could these be signs of diabetes or low blood sugar?\u00a0\u00a0If so, what should I do? I'm turning 18 in two weeks, but my dad won't take me to the doctor because he thinks I'm just being a hypocondriac.\u00a0\u00a0I can't get into the doctor without him being there.\u00a0\u00a0Can somone help??\u00a0\u00a0It also hurts under my right rib cage when I eat, and my back.\u00a0\u00a0HELP!\u00a0\u00a0(I had blood tests, no anemia or signs of infection)",
