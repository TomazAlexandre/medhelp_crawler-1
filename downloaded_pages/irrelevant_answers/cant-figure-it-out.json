            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!A combined infection of EBV, HSV2 and fungus can be very weakening. You could in addition be suffering from some problem of the gut\u2014like fungus there, TB of the gut or any variant of irritable bowel/ulcerative colitis/Crohn\u2019s/Celiac disease. Was the stool examination done? Also diabetes needs to be ruled out as this makes an infection persist in the body.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am a white male in my 30's.\u00a0\u00a0I have always been very healthy and active in sports all of my life until last summer.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing I can pinpoint is that I had a one night stand with a girl that I did not know.\u00a0\u00a0There was protected sex, lots of petting and unprotected oral performed on her.\u00a0\u00a0About 40 days later, It became hard for me to urninate.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the urologist and they found no bacteria in my urine but, I had a swollen prostate.\u00a0\u00a0I was prescribed cipro for 30 days.\u00a0\u00a0I developed thrush at the end of the course and was given a diflucan (that didn't work).\u00a0\u00a0 They also put me on doxycyline because I was still having burning sensations and restricted flow.\u00a0\u00a0This didn't help either.\u00a0\u00a0My girlfriend had was diagnosed with BV at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0I became really sick about a month after this.\u00a0\u00a0Fever, headache, nausea, fatigue, thrush, tingling hands and feet, bumps in my mouth, swollen tonsils, aching joints all over and diarrhea.\u00a0\u00a0My\u00a0\u00a0ENT told me that I tested positive for EBV.\u00a0\u00a0I also tested positive for HSV2.\u00a0\u00a0 My girlfriend has had 2 outbreaks of shingles since this episode.\u00a0\u00a0One in the fall and one at the beginning of this year.\u00a0\u00a0The latter outbreak was pretty severe, It crossed center line which is pretty uncommon.\u00a0\u00a0I have become concerned that this may be a STD.\u00a0\u00a0I went and had all testing done. Syphillis, gonn, chlamydia, hep a/b/c, Hiv 1/2, all negative at 4 months.\u00a0\u00a0Alot of my symptoms have subsided except for occasional fatigue, oral thursh, and achy joints.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on Nystatin 3/day now for almost 75 days and still having oral thrush.\u00a0\u00a0I am also experiencing pencil thin stools once in a while that are mostly green and soft (dissolve to nothing when you flush the toilet).\u00a0\u00a0I have lower abdominal pains once and a while and a dull pain at the base of my sternum that fluctuates right to left sometimes.\u00a0\u00a0I\u00a0\u00a0can't get an answer from my Dr on why I can't be cured.\u00a0\u00a0All of my CBC's, LFT, and other blood work come back normal!\u00a0\u00a0I have become so paranoid of this being some kind of std, I ordered a HIV PCR DNA test that came back negative at 9 1/2 months. My girlfriend is also fatigued and having a wide range on her periods.\u00a0\u00a0One will be next to nothing and the next really heavy.\u00a0\u00a0She also has complained of lower abdomen pains recently as well.\u00a0\u00a0She had a PAP a couple months ago that came back perfect.I am so confused to whats causing these problems.\u00a0\u00a0 It has been almost a year now,\u00a0\u00a0does anyone have any ideas that could be causing all of this?",
