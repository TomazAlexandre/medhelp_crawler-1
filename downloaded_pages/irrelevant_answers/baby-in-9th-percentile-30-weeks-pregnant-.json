            "answer": "My baby was measuring the same (9th percentile) at our 24 week appointment for the anatomy check. But it was only for her head the rest of her body was right on with my due date. They said its lower then they would like so they did another ultrasound at 29 weeks or so because they said maybe its because she was still breech they couldn't get a good measurement of her head. Then it went down to 7th percentile and she was in the head down position at that appointment. They said they didn't want to keep doing ultrasounds on me and that there's nothing they can do really and that we would just have to wait and see.\u00a0\u00a0I passed all my testing for down syndrome, diabetes\u00a0\u00a0etc. I honestly personally feel like maybe it's all the stress I have been under which I feel so bad. I am due in ten days so I am anxious to see her and praying she will just be a little small but healthy. Hang in there it's tuff\u00a0\u00a0because as moms we worry but hopefully our babies are beautiful and healthy even if they ate petite.",

            "answer": "I'm curious what these percentiles are really telling you. I'm 36 weeks and have never been measured. So are you in 9th percentIle of women who get measured at 30 weeks? If so that would be smaller sampling than say the percentile they give you at birth. And even smaller for the poster getting measured at 20 some weeks.I would take that with a grain of salt.",

    "question": "Baby has been measuring small for the past month now. On Monday, my ultrasound measurements were read to me. Our baby girl's abdominal and head was in the 9th percentile. They have to monitor me with another Ultrasound next Monday and bi-weekly stress evaluations.I'm 30 weeks pregnant, first time mom and a little worried. What's the worst that can happen to our baby girl if she stays in the 9th percentile?",
