            "answer": "Well, since you only have been having periods for 2 years now...it's not uncommon for them to be irregular. Although, since now it's been 5 months without a period....I do suggest for you to see a doctor, like a obgyn. There are other symtpoms of PCOS other then overweight and acne. You can actually be normal weight and still have PCOS. Has your weight changed in the time before your periods stopped? Because if your weight went up or down dramatic, then it can cause your period to go a bit crazy. It could also be irregular from stress, which will delay it. Do you have any pains or anything that feels like a period is coming on? I would say talk to your parents, or any other adult that looks over you and go to the doctor. From there, they will run some bloodwork and maybe do a sonogram to make sure you don't have a cyst (a cyst is mostly fluid filled and it could cause your period to stop because of the location).Here are some symptoms of PCOS:anxiety, baldness or thinning hair, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, depression, type 2 diabetes, genetics, heart problems, increased hair growth (hirsuitism), menstruation (periods), obesity, ovarian cysts, pelvic pain, skin problems, sleep disorders, and weight gain.",

            "answer": "You can still have PCOS. It affects everyone different. My sister and I both have it and we have different symptoms. I used to get my period every month until one month it just stoped coming. My sis has always had her period. The only way t oknow whats going on is to go see your obgyn. If you dont want to tell your parents there are places like plan parent hood you can go to and its free. But since your not having sex you should have no problem taking to your parents. Good luck!",
