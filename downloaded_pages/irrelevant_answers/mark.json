    "question": "I have Type 2 diabetes for about 7 years and am on 4 Metformin(500mg) daily. About 3 years ago I started to have erection problems which gradually got worse\u00a0\u00a0until the point, where I now can't have an erection. My doctor has given me several types of tablets including Viagra, all to no avail. I quite often feel a dull pain at the base of my penis and it feels a little irregular when I squeeze it, almost as if it is damaged. Also in the latter stages of being able to have an erection there appeared to be a fairly severe bend in my penis which I never experienced before. Thanking you, Mark",
