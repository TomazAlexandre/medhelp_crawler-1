    "question": "I have had constant headaches for awhile now. Sometimes the pain is behind my left eye, sometimes behind my right eye. The pain moves to different parts of my head always feeling like \"pressure\" at that location. I started feeling dizzy yesterday and all of a sudden got nauseous and threw up. I have taken pain pills and it doesn't seem to make the headache go away. My vision has been going down for the last few months.I first thought that my headaches were contributed to an auto accident I had 11 years ago where I suffered neck and back injury. My neck started to hurt on the left side at the back tendon. Then the pain just kept moving up. Right now the pressure is behind my right eye and when I move my eyes, it feels like something is up against the back of my eye. Not a heavy feeling of contact, but just a light pressure feel.I don't have insurance, so where can I get a MRI done for less?? Is an MRI what I need to get? I live in Tucson Arizona.",
