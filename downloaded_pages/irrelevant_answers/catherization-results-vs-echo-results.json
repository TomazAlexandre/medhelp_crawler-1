    "question": "I just returned from a catherization. I am a 54 yo woman, overweight and\u00a0\u00a0on meds for high blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes.I have been diagnosed with a subaortic membrane for about 4 years.\u00a0\u00a0Last summer I started feeling tired and dizzy. The echo reports showed the following:Dec 05 the peak gradient was 32mmHg;Jan 07 it was 46mmHg;May 07 it was 62mmHg.The catherization I just had showed the peak gradient at 8-11,5 mmHg.The cardiologist is thinking that my dizziness and fatigue is due to being overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I do swim laps two to three times weekly, but have had more difficulty with that due to shortness of breath.The echos also report report moderate pulmonary hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0I recently had a sleep study that showed no sleep apnea and PFT was relatively normal (I think).My cardiologist wants to send me to a major medical center for another opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts on why the peak gradient may show up differently on the echos and on the catherization.Thanks.",
