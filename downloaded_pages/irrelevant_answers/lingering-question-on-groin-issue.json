            "answer": "Hello,These lines can be due to stretch marks. Stretch marks can appear when there is rapid stretching of the skin.It is common in rapid gaining or losing of weight,pregnancy,puberty,cushings syndrome and overuse of steroids.Creams containing alpha hydroxyl acids and retin-A are said to be useful in decreasing the stretch marks but the advertised antimarks creams have no proof of effectiveness. Eat healthy ,nutritious food ,drink plenty of fluids and do moderate exercises. Laser therapy, and dermabrasion, alone or in combination have also been shown to be effective in diminishing the appearance of stretch marks.For that you need to consult a dermatologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have noticed this for the past year or so.\u00a0\u00a0 I put on alittle weight last year.\u00a0\u00a0I have always been very lean and due to some stress added about 20 pounds I did not need.\u00a0\u00a0I had an ingrown hair in my groin region that I was looking at when I pulled my groin fold apart.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed when I pulled it apart I had a light pink line on both groin folds.\u00a0\u00a0 I also noticed similar lines in my stomach creases when I stood up after sitting.\u00a0\u00a0 I lost about 35 pounds and am in the best shape of my life but I still notice these lines in my groin fold.\u00a0\u00a0Some days they are more visible than others. These lines do not itch or really sting but they have me worried I have some sort of fungal infection.\u00a0\u00a0 They have never spread down my inner thigh or really moved from the exact center of my groin fold.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is this normal to have a pink line in skin folds or is this something I should worry about ?",
