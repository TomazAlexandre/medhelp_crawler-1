            "answer": "Not measuring small I'm actually measuring big. Had my 30 week checkup Wednesday and I'm measuring 34cm. Doc told me that if I'm still measuring big in two weeks then she will have me have an ultrasound to see why. I'm nervous because last month I was on track and this month he's measuring as if I'm 34 weeks. I'm hoping I just have a big baby because the other scenario is too much amniotic fluid which could be bad. I'm hoping we both have healthy babies",

            "answer": "My baby has been measuring a bit small too. I wouldn't worry too much. My doctor seemed to think he would catch up eventually. As long as they're not ridiculously small, I don't think there's a big issue going on. They are just the tortoise instead of the hare :)",

    "question": "I went for an ultrasound at 27 weeks and they tokd me my baby was measuring on the small side at 2 pounds 2 oz. I now have been to 3 nst appointments where he seemed to be doing great. Went today do another ultrasound at 31 weeks and he is still measuring small at only 3 pounds. I have now have gestational diabetes. This is my 4th sweet bundle of joy and all I want is a healthy baby boy. I am worried about him everyday. Anyone else experiences issues like this?",
