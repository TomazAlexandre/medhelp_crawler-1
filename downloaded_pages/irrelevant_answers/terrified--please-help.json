            "answer": "To answer your questions:1) A sigmoidoscopy can look for polyps or cancer on the lower left colon.\u00a0\u00a0However, if there continues to be concern or suspicion, a colonoscopy would need to be done.2) Mucous in the stool can be due to chronic pancreatitis or malabsorption.\u00a0\u00a0Blood testing of the amylase and lipase levels and stool analysis can be done if suspected.3) Diabetes can indeed lead to constipation.\u00a0\u00a0I am not aware of fatty liver leading to the symptoms.4) I am not aware of dehydration, diabetes or a fatty liver leading to mucous in the stool.5) The sigmoidoscopy would evaluate the sigmoid colon and below.\u00a0\u00a0Ulcerative colitis would also be seen if present.6) I would consider a colonoscopy at this point for a more thorough evaluation of the colon.These questions can be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patients education only.

            "answer": "I wouldn't give you medical advice (even if I am able), because it is obviously a bad thing to do.Just as a fellow-sufferer, I have gone through a lot of stuff like what you describe, and though it IS important for us to get a *doctor* to run the appropriate test and to insist that they get to the bottom of things- in a reasonable way. ( rarely, they can find something serious).\u00a0\u00a0But a lot of times, the situation is hard ball-like stool causing irritation, small tearing, mucus, and blood to appear.\u00a0\u00a0This can scare people, and doctors shouldn't just dismiss it, because rarely, weird things happen.But with bright blood, a small amount, itching, former finding of hemorrhoids....I just wouldn't be \"terrified,\" since that sounds more like a hemorrhoid than something more serious.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't be \"terrified\" even if more\u00a0\u00a0things were going on (I guess that's because I went through a lot of very very serious stuff - totally unrelated to the symptoms described)Anyway, that is *only* an opinion, and even if it is a h., they often need your doctor to do some treatment.Peace &Prayer\"abe\"",

    "question": "Hi Dr. Kevin,I have been obese for 2 years (280lbs, 6'4'') 36 male.\u00a0\u00a0past few months I have symptoms:1. Brght red Blood on toil paper, tickling, rectal pain, thin brght streaks of blood ostool.2. Last 2 months, stols that are balls and choppy.3. Stool has VERY small, light amount mucus on outside barely attached (u really need look close to see. LIKE THIN SMALL PIECES OF BRokn T PAPER)4. Lower left cramping, pain (a little bit right of the left hip bone)5. NO Diarrhea whatsoever.saw 2 GI doctors:GI Dr. #1 - He did Sgmscpy, found small intrnl hemoid,\u00a0\u00a0No cancers, ibs etc. my father had a polyp at age 58,\u00a0\u00a0Dr said I should colscpy.\u00a0\u00a0Based on symptoms isn't concerned, but he said better safe.\u00a0\u00a0Because of GERD, while I am out he suggested another Stomch Endscpy.GI Dr. #2 - scoped rectm, saw VERY small fissure on rectum, she thinks causing bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0Saw the intrnl hemoird, but too small for sympts.\u00a0\u00a0 Said shape and mucus normal stuff, b/c sgmscpy clear.\u00a0\u00a0said brght blood not due to cancer, would be rectal or sigmoid area. Don\u2019t need a colspy now.\u00a0\u00a0Should at 40.\u00a0\u00a0No need for stomach endoscpy?s:1. If my cramping and pain to the right of my left hip (On the Lft SIDE OF BODY), would the sigmscpy picked up any cancer or polyp located in that area? (Does the sigmscpy cover that area of the colon?)2. Is the light small amount of toilet paper like mucus be part of a normal bowel movement(so light you have to look closely)?3. Would the diabetes and/or fatty liver create these symptoms (small amount of pus, constipation, etc.)4. Can dehydration and or diabetes or fatty liver call changes in the lining of the colon to create this white light mucus?5. Would the sgmscpy picked up cause of mucus or changes in stool size and shape since the mucus is attached to the final stool in the area the stool finally leaves?6.\u00a0\u00a0would you suggest the Colonoscopy now or 40?\u00a0\u00a0Would you suggest another Endoscopy of the Stomach?TY!\u00a0\u00a0C",
