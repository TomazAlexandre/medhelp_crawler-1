            "answer": "HI...in addition to the possibility of diabetes, u will want to rule out acid reflux with is possible being that u were a smoker.There is a condition known as silent reflux in that u r not aware u have reflux...not typical symptoms..like heartburn....so do check into it.....one symptoms of reflux is hunger....the acids r produced to break down foods, but when u have too many, us body sends signals to eat to use up the acids being produced...do look into these issues, both need medical attention.Good luck\"selma\"",

            "answer": "Yes, it is possible that it's due to quitting smoking (congrats on that by the way - my mom was a heavy smoker for nearly 60+ years and just quit about 3 years ago), but I would also try and rule out other causes for it such as the diabetes or perhaps even a thyroid problem, or like Selma suggested, reflux.I'm a bit concerned about the blood blisters that you've been noticing on your fingers - not quite sure what they may possibly be related to, so I would suggest having those checked into also.When you get hungry like that, do you experience any other symptoms such as weakness, racing heart, sweating, etc?\u00a0\u00a0Have you also noticed that you're urinating more than usual?",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You will be surprised to know that stomach ulcers and severe acidity can result in hunger pangs. Even GERD presents with similar symptoms. At times the hunger pangs due to acidity wakes up a person in the wee hours of night. If you are on contraceptive depot shot then this can cause acidity and make you feel as though you are hungry due to lot of acid. The other possibility is diabetes, hyperthyroid states and worms in the gut. All can keep you hungry 24x7.Please consult your PCP to run appropriate tests to rule out these conditions.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "When your sugar/glucose or lactose levels aren't right your food won't digest properly(because your lever,pancreatic and gallbladder will produce more or less sugar and your body won't use all the vitamins from the food therefore you will feel hungry). How often do you go to bathroom?The glucose\u00a0\u00a0test is essential to rule out diabetes when this ruled out then your doctor probably with diagnose you with digestive disorder like IBS/GERD . Quiting smoking can increase your appetite as your mind tells you to smoke and you trying to occupy your mind\u00a0\u00a0so you eat.This is a reason why people must not just quit smoking suddenly they must reduce dosage on daily basis, try electronic cigarettes(it's harmless)",
