You would need to insert a catheter into your bladder several times per day to completely empty your bladder and then remove it and go about your business. In some women I have given drugs such as Flomax (or other alpha blockers) with success, though the pharmacist will question why this drug for prostatic obstruction is being prescribed for you.Good luck.S.A.Liroff, M.D.theterization also is quite effective.

    "question": "I am wondering if there is any treatment, besides a catheter, for a distended bladder. I have had several tests done - none of them indicating that there is any obvious blockage - but have concluded that my bladder is obviously distended. Very rarely get a strong urge to urinate, when i do go not that much comes out and it is somewhat difficult to release - seemingly no pressure. often have to press on it to release but know that there is still a significant amount of urine left in the bladder when i am done.would bladder training work - similar to training used for incontinence. Please help. My doctor is of no help and this has been going on for a long time. It should be mentioned that i am an otherwise healthy 33 yr old female.Any help would be appreciated.Thanks",
