            "answer": "My oldest step daughter has add without the hyper activity and she is very forget ful when it comes to turning in school assignments. i don't know if you have had him checked for add, not ahad. Or he might just be acting like a teen, with a plate full. It was a difficult time for all three of my teenage step children starting in jr. high. They are expected to take on so much more than when they were in elementry. Two of the three have finished high school and are doing fine now, but the seventh grade was the hardest on our oldest because she would forget her assignments at school or would not turn them in after we helped her complete them. We got her teachers to send notes home with assignments written down. I would talk to his teachers and see if he is having a conflict with another student or some members of the staff.",

    "question": "I have a 12-year-old stepson who was diagnosed with Type 1 when he was 4 years old. He uses a pump. He had wonderful grades in elementary school, but since being in junior high last year, his grades are slipping and we have a hard time getting him to turn in his work. It seems that he is very forgetful (for instance last week we helped him do a lengthy math assignment at home and he forgot to take it from his locker to class). The teacher would not let him go back and get it so he had to do it over in class while the teacher was going over it. He gets 0's on some papers just because he doesn't turn things in, even though we have helped him develop tools to remember. He is not hyperactive, sleeps well, and gets exercise. How much of this behavior may be related to diabetes and how much of it is just being a 12-year-old?\u00a0\u00a0Or could it be a learning disorder that is just becoming evident?",
