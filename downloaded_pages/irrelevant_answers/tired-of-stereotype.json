            "answer": "The causes of diabetes are complex. Being overweight and inactive is one factor that some people have, gestational diabetes is another, genetics and age are a part of the picture as well. But the bottom line is nobody wants diabetes and nobody deserves diabetes, whether they are overweight, normal weight, or underweight. Diabetes is NOT fair, and ultimately we may not know and it doesn't really matter how we got it. You are not alone in being frustrated by the unfairness of diabetes. I think the whole point of this list is that we are all in the same boat. We all have diabetes it's what we do with it that counts, not how or why we got it. Just my opinion.",

            "answer": "I'm looking to cure it or slow it down by reading and getting info on holistic approaches - books from the library. There's something about brindle berry (HCA) and chromium. In my mind, I know there's a logical solution. Yes, I'm frustrated and like all diabetics, it ain't fair, but I'm dealing with it the best I can. And, with the current economic climate, money is tight and my costs for this THING have gone up with medication and testing supplies. So, I guess, all in all, aren't we all frustrated? It's time to be proactive, we're all in the same boat.",

            "answer": "I very much agree. I was diagnosed in July 2007 and my diabetes has already progressed to the point where I need Insulin. I have eaten healthy for many years so for me the diet part wasn't a big adjustment. I live in Guatemala now and pay a lot more for meds than I did in the states because my insurance reimburses at a much lower rate. I went to a doctor in the U.S. and he prescribed a year's worth of meds I can have shipped but now my doctor here has put me on Insulin. At least Insulin is cheaper than the three oral meds I was taking!When I visited my family in California last November I was frustrated by their lack of understanding and support for my dietary needs and schedule. I feel like we need to educate the people around us about our needs. Now with Insulin it seems even more regulated. It took me many years to learn to eat well and listen to my body and now I am attached to a clock and a glucose meter. I am retired and my schedule is pretty flexible; I can't imagine how all of you who work busy full schedules manage...my hat is off to you!But I am hopeful as I have just begun Insulin and I want to tell all of you that it isn't the end of the world! If anything I feel much better and studies now show that if Insulin is started sooner the outcome is better.I just found this List and really look forward to learning from you all and contributing my own experience. I agree that reading and learning about our illness is mandatory! I have to admit that I have absolutely zero knowledge of holistic approaches. When I was diagnosed I went right to oral meds and 19 months later I'm on Insulin. I'm excited about learning about natural supplements I can use to help balance my blood sugar.",

    "question": "Not really a question - but getting to my wits end with diabetes as a result of the obese couch potato. I had gestational in 2004 and was later diagnosed with type 2 last summer. I have always been active, ate healthy and I've stayed around the weight of 120 at 5'7\". I'm so sick and tired of the stereotype and the majority, if not all, the material I read about diabetes caused by eating a pour diet and not exercising like I had brought this upon myself. I just want scream \"No I didn't!!!\" I get the \"you don't look like a diabetic\" or the box of chocolate waved under my nose \"come on, you're skinny.\" Needless to say, I'm getting really frustrated and feel somewhat alone as having this THING not brought on by bad habits.",
