They will probably monitor you more tho if ir comes back positive. Don't read to much online as it normally freaks people out more than helps. I am guilty of that big time. Normally they make you eat a little different or have shots but its only for a short time ange goes away after birth.",

            "answer": "Don't worry too much. I just got diagnosed with gestational diabetes at 34 Weeks. They tested my sugars twice because I was high risk for it and the second tone it came back high. They told me the risk to the baby is that he might grow too much to fast and if in the last month the sugars are high then the baby will produce too much insulin to regulate, so he'd be born with low blood sugar. They said most the time they can regulate it by diet. If you are diagnosed with diabetes they will likely give you a glucometer to keep an eye on you're sugars daily, you will have more appts with perinatology, and you and baby will be monitered more closely. Positive side! More ultrasounds!",

            "answer": "Im going for my second glucose test one this morning - i failed the first one... as i did with my last pregnancy... GD isnt the funnest to have but its very doable and the horror stories your reading about are most likely from uncontrolled diabetes... knowing if you have it and controlling your sugars (through diet/exercise and or meds) prevents the baby from growing too big... and the best part is its temporary :) so its not an ideal choice for someone to live with but its really not that bad once you get the flow of things... heres hoping you pass your test... and me too:)",

            "answer": "For the 3 hour they will have you fast. If you're just taking a one hour go ahead and not eat or drink amything after midnight it can't be to high from foods or anything if you haven't eaten them. Um if you are going to eat avoid carbs fruit soft drinks juices gatorade stuff like that. If you take the test and don't pass before you leave the doc will be notified you didn't pass and will decide what you need to do from there. You'll probably be put on a diet and maybe meds. Risks to the baby are actually not that high. I am high risk for it but passed my 3 hour after failing my 1 hour. Stress can also raise your blood sugar some so try not to stress about it. Good luck!",

            "answer": "Talk to your dr office about what their restrictions are for the test!! Mine allowed me to eat all day except no sugar for the 3 hours before the test. My appt was at 3pm so if I couldnt eat after midnight that would have meant a whole entire day without food!! Not good. But I just ate a normal breakfast and then a big snack right before noon so that I wouldnt eat anything for 3 hours. Just check with them to be certain because I know all dr offices are different. I passed just fine and only had the 1 hour one.",

Last time by sticking to a healthy diet I kept it under control and I managed to loose weight off my body, by the time I went into labour I was 1kg (2.2 lb) heavier than before I was pregnant and then when bub came out she was 7lb 15oz & I instantly lost 10kg (22lb). I also felt a lot healthier on the diet, my body wasn't as sluggish and I had more energy! Good luck!!",

I advise you to not worry and stress over it....worrying and stressing actually raises your sugar levels and if you do it all the night before and in the morning before the test you will have false results! I just had mine done last week...try to relax and not worry until your doctor tells you to worry! Best of luck dear!",
