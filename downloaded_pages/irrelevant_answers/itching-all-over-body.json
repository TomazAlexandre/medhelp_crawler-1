            "answer": "Hello,Whenever there is itchy skin all over the body without any rash then some possibilities which should be thought of are dry skin, eczema, hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals, wool, soaps, cosmetics and certain foods.Apply an anti itch lotion like Sarna lotion and take some antihistaminic like Benadryl or Claritin. Also wear cotton clothes and consult a dermatologist as you may need topical steroids which should be taken under medical supervision.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
