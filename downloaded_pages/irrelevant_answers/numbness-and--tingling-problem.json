            "answer": "Hi,How are you?The symptoms of tingling numbness on one side of the body can be due to peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or B12 deficiency, nerve compression at the cervical level.Since the symptoms are acute neurological causes like brain tumors also cannot be ruled out.Has she undergone MRI of brain and neck?Please advise her to consult an experienced neurologist and discuss these possibilities.Take care!",

        {
            "answer": "Thanks for the response. Diabetes test has been done, and other test like MRI Scan of brain and neck is also done, all the reports are normal. She did meet a neurologist, he said that he feels that there is no need for any test if you want then you can go for needle test.All the Drs have said that she is suffering from nerve compression, but i fail to understand that can it be so bad, like all the time she faces weakness and numbness. And does it take so long to heal.",
