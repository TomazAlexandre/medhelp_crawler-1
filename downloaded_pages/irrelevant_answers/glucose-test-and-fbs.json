            "answer": "It sounds like the regular (1 hour) glucose test, though I only got poked once, an hour after the drink.\u00a0\u00a0As far as I know, it's pretty routine in pregnancy these days, they're just making sure you don't have gestational diabetes.",

            "answer": "i just had that done today as well. i went in, drank a nasty sugary orange gatorade type drink (yukkk!!) and got a TON (like 7!) of blood tube-y thingys drawn after one hour. like above posters said, its completely normal and most pregnant women get it for gestational diabetes testing. if i fail the one hour test, then i have to go for a three hour fasting test, pretty much the same as the first test i took today but a little longer and no eating beforehand. i have a really cool doctor that explained all this to me as this is my first baby and had no clue why this was necessary.",

She didn't know why they would want a \"Fasting Blood Sugar\" test and then a \"Glucose Tolerance Test\". That kind of concerned me. I just hope everything is ok. Thanks everyone for the info :)",

    "question": "Ok, so I went in today for the GTT and they said that my doctor also ordered a fasting blood sugar test. Do you know why he would do this? I'm kind of concerned because I have never had that done, or at least not that I know of. This isn't my first pregnancy, but like I said, it's the first time they do that to me. So I had to get poked right when I went in and then again an hour after that nasty drink. Anyone have any idea??",
