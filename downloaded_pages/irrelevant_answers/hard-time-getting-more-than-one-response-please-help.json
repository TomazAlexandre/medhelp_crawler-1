    "question": "MY FNA came back today and showed benign adenomas with minimal Hurhtle cells.\u00a0\u00a0Diagnosis Hurhtle cell adenoma rather than Hurthle cell neoplasm.\u00a0\u00a0My Endo talked to the 4 pathologists about the pathology report.\u00a0\u00a0One of them is from John Hopkins.\u00a0\u00a0I live in Ft. Lauderdale.\u00a0\u00a0They are in agreement that it is benign nodules.\u00a0\u00a0They are 1.9cm and 1.4.\u00a0\u00a0Both contain a small amount of Hurthle adenoma cells.\u00a0\u00a0My Endohas decided that she wants to send the report to the U of Miami to make sure they concur.\u00a0\u00a0What am I up against.\u00a0\u00a0PLEASE someone explain this to me.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
