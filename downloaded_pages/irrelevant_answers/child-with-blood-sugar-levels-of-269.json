            "answer": "I think I would get into a specialist ASAP instead of waiting one the Ped just to be on the safe side. If you cannot get in right away, still go see you Ped but keep your specialist appt for sure. I definitely think his blood sugar is too high going from the sounds of your comments. Make sure you take his blood sugar before he eats to get an accurate reading, always use an alcohol wipe to clean the area before testing as any food or substance on the testing could cause a higher reading if not clean, and test before meals and just before bed would be my opinion.Take care, K",
