            "answer": "Was the one hour fasting?\u00a0\u00a0When I did my one hour, it was not fasting, therefore if you ate anything high in carbs prior, your glucose level may have been high.\u00a0\u00a0With my last pregnancy (only made it to 9 weeks), they I failed my one hour with over 200, took the 3 hour and passed that...I think being it was fasting.\u00a0\u00a0(They have me test early b/c my Mom had Gest. Diabetes)......The blood test is generally more accurate than a regular glucometer.....I'm an RN and sometimes we play around and check our own on the hospital units and get different readings every time...one right after another,......",

            "answer": "Definitely do the 3h glucose test.\u00a0\u00a0The thing about the 1h test is your system is bombarded with an abnormally large amount of sugar in a short time and the blood test will measure your response to it - this is quite different from measuring your levels throughout the day which may be more \"normal\" because your sugar intake could have been at a relatively low level.\u00a0\u00a0In essence, testing your levels throughout the day is not necessarily a good indicator of whether you have GD or not.\u00a0\u00a0That being said, it is not uncommon for a pregnant women to fail the 1h test but pass the 3 h test - usually, this is because fasting rules may not have been followed for the 1h as Kelly said.",

    "question": "I was just informed I needed to do a 3 hour glucose tolerance test because my one hour was \"very high\" at 191.\u00a0\u00a0I have a calibrated glucometer and I've done finger/arm tests throughout the day and have not had anything remotely abnormal.\u00a0\u00a0I had a fasting blood sugar level of 93 first thing in the AM and all my levels after eating were 135 or below.Could the 191 have been error?\u00a0\u00a0Should I request to have the one hour test repeated first before I torture myself with the three hour test?\u00a0\u00a0Or should I just suck it up and do the test.\u00a0\u00a0I just have a hard time with a \"gestational diabetes\" diagnosis when I have yet to see any abnormal values after two days of continuous testing....",
