            "answer": "Medications for erectile disfunction (ED) do not cause conjunctivitis. They have been associated with \"blue vision\" while they are in the blood but that is a temporary problem. There is a possible link with damage to the optic nerve (non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy). However this link is not definitely established and has almost always occured in men with risk factors for this problem (advanced age, high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, etc).Your present problems are not due to the ED medicine and are not due to the prednisolone. Prednisolone is a potent anti-inflmmatory that would make almost any type of conjunctivitis better. Moreover this medication is rapidly cleared from the body in eyedrop form and could in no way persist causing problems after a week off the medication.There are many cause of chronic conjunctititis and many things that simulate chronic conjunctivitis that are not chronic conjunctivitis (example dry eyes, eyelid abnormalities, hyperthyroidism for example).You need to see an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive medical eye examination (look for the MD after his/her name). If you live in a large or even middle size community, you might consider a corneal and external eye disease subspecialist. This type of ophthalmologist is sometimes in private practice and most medical school, department of ophthalmology have such a specialist.JCH MD",

            "answer": "Thank you very much for your prompt response.\u00a0\u00a0I will definately seek out a corneal and external eye disease subspecialist ASAP.\u00a0\u00a0I will also look in to the possibility of damage to the non-arteric ischemic optic neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0I must point out, that I have read a vast amount of testimonies that describe one of the side effects of cialis, the ED drug in question, as bloodshot eyes.\u00a0\u00a0I have also read a great deal about the possibility of dependency and rebound from prednisolone.\u00a0\u00a0Since I had no preexisting condition before I took the medications, and have not been found to have any underlying condition through my doctor visits since I have been prescribed these medications, I really don't think it can be from anything else but the cialis, or prednisolone.\u00a0\u00a0I've gone through the a few comprehensive medical eye examinations, the dry eye tests, and have not been found to have anything abnormal w/ eyelids or hyperthyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0I am a relatively young, healthy, non smoker, and I have been blessed with low blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a few medical professionals tell me the same thing you are, that it can't be from the presnisolone or cialis, but I feel I have narrowed it down to the only possibilities through the process of elimination.\u00a0\u00a0I greatly appreciate your input, and will most definately keep the forum updated as to the findings of an external eye disease subspecialist.\u00a0\u00a0What a wonderful tool this forum is as another resource in the vast world of healthcare advice.",

    "question": "Over 2 years ago I took an ED medication and had eye problems including conjunctivitis, light sensitivity, and discomfort. I stopped taking the meds, and was prescribed prednisolone opthalmic solution to undo the damage caused by the medication.\u00a0\u00a0The prednisolone reversed the damage temporarily, but in the end exaccerbated the problem extrordinarily.\u00a0\u00a0I now have very bad conjunctivitis, light sensitivity, and discomfort constantly, and it has severely affected my life. I have seen doctors since and apparently my vision is ok, and I don't have any excessive amount of eye pressure, and therefore they seem to treat it like it is not a big deal.\u00a0\u00a0Nobody has told me anything that is possible to undo the problems caused by the prednisolone.\u00a0\u00a0I no longer take any medications or eye drops and haven't for about 2 years, yet the problems are not going away.\u00a0\u00a0My posting on this forum is a sign of my desperation to find anything that would help. Any thoughts or ideas would be greatly appreciated.",
