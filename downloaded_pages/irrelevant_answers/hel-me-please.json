            "answer": "Your post needs some details. There is no such thing as a \"type 1 and type 2 diabetes test\". Once the doctor diagnoses someone with diabetes, there are then tests that can determine type if it is unclear (Antibody and c-peptide). But it sounds as if you were not diagnosed with diabetes in February, or even pre-diabetes? What was your A1C? Or if you didn't have an A1C, what was your fasting? (A1C is the true test for diagnosis).To answer your question, yes, it is certainly possible to develop type 1 or LADA in that short a space of time. And if the doctor didn't test completely, or didn't determine pre-diabetes, it is possible to be type 2. If you are concerned, get an A1C test.",

            "answer": "There is no such thing as a test being \"negative\". It has a number and the number tells you if you are pre-diabetic or diabetic. You should find out more when you are getting tests about what the tests are called and what they mean. It is your body, right? If you are concerned and think you might be diabetic, yes, even though it has only been 7 months you should ask for an A1C test. The numbers are: Under 5.7= normal; 5.7-6.4=pre-diabetes, 6.5 and higher = diabetes.",
