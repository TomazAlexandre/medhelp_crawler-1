            "answer": "bandman, good to hear from you.Well here is my opinion.Don't exactly remember your bx, but seem to remember you had very little liver damage.If I myself was going to do the watch and wait, I would verify with multiply corresponding tests( fibroscan, fibrosure, bx..etc.,at least 2 of them)\u00a0\u00a0that I am under stage 2-3. I hear of way to many people 'mysteriously' progressing almost instantly to a much higher stage of liver damage. My Dr chalks that up to error rate on BX. Hence my reason for multiply tests. This is way to important to make a mistake on damage, and consequently make a mistake on tx delay.Its good you are keeping your IR under control, since on triple therapy with the new drugs, you will also need to respond to inf.This is a catch 22 though, since HCV causes IR and once you clear the HCV you probably will not be IR anymore. Maybe Co will maybe chime in on this and explain better.If you did decide to treat again now with soc and your IR under control you might be RVR. If not RVR or at least cEVR I would stop tx and wait for the PI drugs added to soc.But on the other hand, with the new drugs right around the corner and shorter duration tx, you might be better off waiting and watching carefully if you have a verified lower damage bx. This is a very important decision you have to make with your Hepatologist.Anyhow, very happy you found out about your IR. This is a very positive finding as far as you being able to clear HCV ...with combo therapy or the new triple therapy.apache",
