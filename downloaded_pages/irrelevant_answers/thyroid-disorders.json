            "answer": "Hi,Thank you for writing on behalf of your friend.From what I know, there is no link direct between pancreatitis and thyroid disorders in general. If low thyroid is present and results in high cholesterol, this could trigger a pancreatitis episode. Possibly autoimmune disease of the thyroid may be associated wit autoimmune pancreatic disease(and cause problems such as Type 1 diabetes) but not pancreatic disease in the sense of pancreatitis.Autoimmune thyroid disease is linked with Type 1 diabetes as they both are atleast partially immune mediated, but having one does not automatically mean you will develop the other. You do have to be on the look out for it though.Repeated episodes or severe pancreatitis can lead to diabetes because of deaths in the pancreatic cells, leading to a loss of insulin producing cells. I have had several patients who developed diabetes after severe bouts of pancreatitis, or after having it repeatedly over many years.If you are concerned about your friend having thyroid disease, he/she should definitely see a doctor soon.Hope this helps.Take care.",

    "question": "Okay I am aware this is a diabetes forum, but the thyroid ask a doctor forum is full, like they usually are.. and am seeking advice..I was wondering, because a friend of mine has shown symptoms of hyperthyroidism, after I had done some research, and I plan on urging them to get this checked out. I also know that this person's father has pancreatitis. I read that thyroid disorders can be hereditary. Do you think that this has anything to do with the possible hyperthyroidism, the association between pancreatitis and thyroid disorders? I can't find much about it. And are thyroid disorders linked with diabetes? Is pancreatitis linked with diabetes as well?Thank you for your time, I appreciate it.",
