            "answer": "I just started researching this topic as I have 2 aunts on my mom's side with Alzheimer's.From what I've read thus far, 7 years seems to be the average life expectancy.But, I don't know how the statistics would apply to someone in their 90s; nor if old age has an impact on how quickly the disease advances. I would think that old age could very well take the person before they actually succumb to the disease... but, that's just my non-professional, uneducated guess.",

Also the meds that are out there I think have some way of slowing it down a bit, but not sure if that really even helps. My Dad was on aricept. Each person is different.",
