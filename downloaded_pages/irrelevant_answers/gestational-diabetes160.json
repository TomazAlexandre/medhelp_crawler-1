Think about all the yummy food we can eat after birth! This pregnancy had been a nightmare with constant nausea, spd and diabetes.",

            "answer": "I had GD during the last trimester of my pregnancy and was so devastated/scared that I no longer wanted to eat. I thought it was the most traumatic experience but you don't have to stop eating what you like, just portion control, carb count (which *****) and tons of water. My dietician was very helpful and provided resources to help me through it. Don't be like me and go crazy on junk food after delivery, lol. I eat 8 chocolate chip cookies almost every day now, trying to make up for lost time, lol . :P",

My doctor made it sound like I could never again eat a carb which is totally not true. The diet isnt all that bad. It ***** when I want desert or something like that. But I have been craving meat,\u00a0\u00a0which is carb free anyway! Good luck to you I know its hard!",

            "answer": "I was diabetic before pregnancy so I had to follow the diet even more strictly since I was scared to death about complications. I found out I was pregnant at 6 weeks and before pregnancy I'd cheat all the time. But even till this day I'm still starving. Lol. I can't wait my 2 and half hours for my next snack or meal lol. It's all about porportions. One thing that helped was my doctor said it's okay to go over on protein and veggies. Just stick within range of the carbs since that's what spikes your sugar more. So I added a salad to every lunch and dinner just cuz I feel I need to eat more. Plus the additional veggies on my plate. And usually try to stick to lean meats. I serve a portion and a half. Sometimes 2. My weight has stayed stable and my sugars have been great. Oh and lots of water! I know it's so hard but it's something we just have to do. I hope the time Flys for you :)",
