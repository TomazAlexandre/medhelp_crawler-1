            "answer": "The only honest advice you can get in a forum like this, is to consult a medical doctor. You are only 20 and there are many things to be checked before sending you away on a prescription.But since it is already 3 yrs, I would guess it is nothing serious.\u00a0\u00a0I hope the pattern of your headache has not changed. Until you meet the doctor you have to be on the usual medicines you take, and rest.Best rgds,Thomas Antony",

            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.I would suggest you to get checked for anemia. Anemia can cause headaches, weakness and dizziness. Other benign causes like low BP, low blood sugar levels and dehydration also need to be ruled out.Make sure you eat and sleep on time and drink plenty of fluids during the day. Green leafy vegetables and salads will help to replenish Iron.Hope this helps!",

            "answer": "Thanks, a few years ago a doctor did say that I had anemia, but I took Iron supplements and they said that it was fine? I also have gotten diagnosed with producing to much insulin, but my blood sugar levels are normal. I am kind of weary though about the insulin diagnosis, because when they said that they gave me a perscription for Metformin, which I thought was for diabetics who don't produce enough insulin. Do I still need to take an iron supplement because I work out 2 hours a day and at the end, my energy is really low.Thanks",

            "answer": "Hi,Excessive production of insulin or hyperinsulinemia is often associated with type 2 diabetes. The most common cause of hyperinsulinemia is insulin resistance which triggers the pancreas to produce more insulin. So this condition is treated like diabetes.I would suggest you to get yourself tested for anemia and if the test results are positive, then you can take Iron supplements. Meanwhile make sure you take plenty of green leafy vegetables.Hope this helps!",

    "question": "I have been having headaches for about 3 years, maybe more, but it never seems to go away. I thought that it was because of my eyes, but I got my eyes checked and a new perscription and it didn't help. When I really get a bad headache I get weak and dizzy and sometimes even faint. I can barely stand up for an hour when I have the bad headaches. I have taken tylenol, and ibprofin, and advil, but nothing seems to work. My headache usually starts in the center of my head and goes to the back sides of my head. I have started having back problems and it seems that lately I haven't been getting any sleep. I take ambien, but that doesn't help me sleep either. I am 20 years old. Is this something that I should be worried about?Thanks for any suggestions.",
