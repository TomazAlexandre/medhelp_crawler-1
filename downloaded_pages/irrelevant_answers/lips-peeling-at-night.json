            "answer": "In addition, apply petroleum jelly (Vaseline is a brand name.) to your lips before you go to bed.\u00a0\u00a0I've had this problem for a few years, so I know it's not simple dehydration, since I myself drink water like there's no tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0Drinking more water is always good, though, since most people don't drink enough.",

            "answer": "Two thoughts, first I agree with previous poster that you should apply a Vaseline type of chap-stick to your lips at night. Chances are your a nighttime mouth breather (as opposed to nose breathing).\u00a0\u00a0That also makes me think you might have allergies. If you do have allergies and you take an antihistamine, that can contribute to your dry lips.\u00a0\u00a0Bottom line is keep your lips moist with chap-stick at night and it should be fine.",
