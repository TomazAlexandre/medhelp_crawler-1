The low or high risk?I dont know much about CMV except that it falls somewhere with the herpes virus.High lymphocytes are white blood cells that help fight foreign infections in the body. How severe are your night sweats?You need a proper diagnosis from a doctor, go get a std screening.Does your family have a history of diabetes? If so, you may be at risk but doesnt mean you will get it. Seems like you are fairly physically active so im not going to asume you are obese. Just get a blood sugar check by your doctor to make sure.dont know much about myeloma or lupus. Get checked asap.",
