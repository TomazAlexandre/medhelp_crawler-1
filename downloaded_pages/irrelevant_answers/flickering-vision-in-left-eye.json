            "answer": "The underactive thyroid should not be a cause.\u00a0\u00a0There are a number of things that people describe as 'flickering'. Sometimes it is used to describe a twitch of the eyelids. This is called myokymia and is an irritable eye muscle and is usually temporary and not a serious problem. It has been discussed before in the Eye Forum.Sometimes it is the vision that is flickering. If the problem lasts 5-10 minutes or longer and the flickering can be seen with the eye shut, it can be due to ophthalmic or eye migraine (many of which have no headaches), rarely seizure disorders or circulatory disturbances (TIAs or transient ischemic attacks). The problem might be due to drying of the cornea when asleep (exposure keratitis), mucous on the cornea or other situation that would require an examination and additional questioning.Your plan to see an ophthalmologist (EyeMD) to exclude eye or body disease is a sound one and I urge you to keep the appointment.JCH MD",

            "answer": "My eye physicial has diagnosed the condition as BRVO (mild).I received some results from my blood work which I will discuss next week with my regular doctor. All levels are within range except for the TSH (0.39) and the MPV (7.3). Would these levels contribute to the BRVO condition? Additionally, I am on thyroid medication -- which will most likely be adjusted to the \"over-active\" result. My eye doctor also sent me for bloodwork, which will be reviewed next Monday.\u00a0\u00a0I guess my main question is this:\u00a0\u00a0Can BRVO go away by itself or is the condition non-reversible?",

            "answer": "Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) is usually less serious than Central Retinal Vein Occlusion. If the BRVO does not involve the macula (center vision of the eye) it often requires no treatment and \"goes away by itself\". If the macula is involved there can be swelling that may interfere with vision. Even this may go away with time. In some cases if the condition worsens or does not respond to waiting then cautious use of laser is done.\u00a0\u00a0Your eye examination by an ophthalmologist (EyeMD) should have exclude glaucoma, which can sometimes cause BRVO.In a BRVO one of the most important things to do is work with the family doctor or internist to be sure there is no underlying disease that caused the problem. The most common causes are high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, high cholesteral, heart problems, blood that is coagulates too quickly (blood dyscrasias), inflamation of the blood vessels (vasculitis), possibly birth control pills/hormones and obesity. Often the examination is normal and no cause is found. Physicians call this \"idopathic\" (doctor word for 'we don't know why'). Any disease that is found should be actively treated. Some physicians put patients with BRVO on low dose aspirin. Ongoing observation by you ophthalmologist is important.JCH MD",
