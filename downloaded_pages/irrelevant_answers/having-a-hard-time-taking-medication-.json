            "answer": "Get as many things prepared the night before, so it removes wasted time in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0For example, lay out the clothes the kids are supposed to wear so there's no conference or dispute in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0Lay out the breakfast dishes on the table, and pre prep food so it's a snap to serve.\u00a0\u00a0Have a plan of who needs their teeth brushed by when, who gets to use the shower first, second, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Post the tasks with target due times on a wall on white board with erasable marker, and revise in the evening with the kids if the targets were met or not.\u00a0\u00a0Give them a treat or kudos if they did meet the targets, and if not, come up with a plan with them to resolve it, and try out the revised plan next morning.\u00a0\u00a0Give the kids as much responsibility as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Make them choose the clothes and lay them out the night before.\u00a0\u00a0Make them set the table and pre prep the breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0Have them make their lunch and snacks.\u00a0\u00a0Delegate as much as you can, so you are not left with all the work, your job becomes supervisor and not the maid, and they have no one but themselves to complain about if they don't like the clothes, lunch, snacks, etc.I know it sounds a bit draconian, but what I discovered is that kids LOVE order and reliable surroundings.\u00a0\u00a0Kids breakdown and take advantage of anarchy situations.\u00a0\u00a0But, if they have a framework that they know is consistent, and they get the hugs, appreciation, tenderness, display of love and pat on the back\u00a0\u00a0for pitching in, they feel good about it and become part of the solution.\u00a0\u00a0If they are too young today to pitch in, then do it yourself.\u00a0\u00a0But, they eventually get older, and that's when you start getting them to help out. Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
