            "answer": "Hi,How are you?The problem with MS is that it is very difficult to diagnose. There is no specific test to make an accurate diagnosis.MRI findings are also not diagnostic. The diagnosis of MS is based on two more episodes of neurological symptoms less than a month apart and lasting for at least 24 hrs coupled with positive MRI findings and CSF exam.Your symptoms could also be due to peripheral neuropathy which can be due to diabetes or vitamin B deficiency.From your symptoms it does not seem to be a relapse. MRI findings will help in making the diagnosis. If the MRI is negative this time too, chances of MS are very slim. Do keep us posted! Take care!",

    "question": "Hi there, I'm wondering whether anyone here can shed any light on this.About 4 years ago I was investigated for MS. My vision had changed slightly (which was put down to an eye operation I had as a child) and my right hand was frequently numb and tingling.I had 2 MRIs done, ordered by 2 different neurologists and all were clear, as were evoked potential tests on my eyes, hands and feet. I was told I didn't have MS and it was very unlikely to ever be so as the pattern of my symptoms didn't quite add up, which was a great relief, and that they didn't know what I had they symptoms would probably just go away, which they did.I didn't think anymore about it until recently. I've been back to the see the neurologist as for several months my hand has been sore again, tingly, numb, and is now travelling further up my arm and is becoming quite uncomfortable. I'm also getting similar sensations in my foot although they're not so pronounced, and the leg gets achey for no reason.I was hoping the neurologist would tell me I was being paranoid, but he was concerned and ordered me back for another MRI and to see an opthalmologist.I get the MRI results soon, but the opthalmologist said my eyes were completely normal and there was no evidence of optic neuritis.I feel in my heard that this is probably going to be an MS diagnosis, which is soul-destroying for a 30-year-old woman who has just met a great guy, has plans to travel the world for the next two years and then start having kids. I'm desperately hoping it's not. I have been tested for everything under the sun (lupus, diabetes, celiac, b12, etc etc) and they're all clear, so I'm prepared for bad news.But in the meantime, my question is, how accurate is the MRI? I took great heart in the fact that my 2 MRIs were clear previously. I know that 5% of people who have MS initially have a clear MRI for one reason or another, but 2?I also was under the impression that a relapse was a sudden loss of movement/vision, which I've never had. It's always just been tingly, numb and sore. Does this count as a relapse?Would appreciate any thoughts anyone has.Thanks very much",
