            "answer": "I cannot say for sure. I am not a vet unfortunately so don't know everything about this problem.I once fainted and just before, was terribly thirsty suddenly.So that might be why she faints while drinking water...(?) And the cause might be something entirel unconnected with drinking.Or it might be that she doesn't breathe while drinking, and although most animals can handle that she may have some weakness somewhere which makes her pass out if she doesn't breathe for a short time...(?)I am sorry you have no faith in the vets where you are. The obvious answer is take her to be checked by a vet.It might be that you need advice from a qualified veterinarian online. There are such websites.For online advice from a vet you could try this site. It says it is free:http://web-dvm.net/askthevet.htmlThere are others. I seem to remember some do charge but it is not a lot of money. I will look for other websites and post back. Hope it will be of some help.",

            "answer": "I am sorry you don't have better Vets in your area.My first question would be, where did you get your dog from and have you contacted the breeder?\u00a0\u00a0Simply put, these breeds of dogs with short noses can have problems breathing.\u00a0\u00a0She may have lack of oxygen to the brain while drinking, causing her to faint.Another possibility might be a heart problem but that would have to be diagnosed by a Vet.Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can cause fainting but I don't know what that would have to do with drinking water. You would probably see other signs like her being wobbly, lethargic, etc.It's possible she is having some type of seizure.Not all Vets are familiar with the issues the Bulldog breeds can have which means you may be even more limited as to Vet care.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you have gotten this pup some aVet care and it has it's shots.Call the person you got the dog from.\u00a0\u00a0One woukd hope, if they are breeding these dogs, they may have an answer and be aware of any possible genetic cause.If you can talk to the breeder,mind out what Vet they use.Search the Internet for French Bulldog health issues and read up on the breed.\u00a0\u00a0Try a search for The National Bulldog Club.\u00a0\u00a0I assume they have one.\u00a0\u00a0Breed specific sites can be very informative.Good luck and please come back and update us.",

            "answer": "Hi. In addition to what others have said, which is ALL relevant ... fainting and low-blood sugar (possibly diabetes) is very common - and this would link up with the water drinking, if excessive. The fainting may be a hypo attack or even a small seizure, again, both common in diabetes.You need a vet to diagnose what's wrong here. This isn't something you should ignore or leave too long.Tony",
