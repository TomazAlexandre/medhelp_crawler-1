            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Yes calcification of arteries is visible in X ray films. Calcification of vessels at your age is not common, as it occurs in the elderly. The commonest causes for calcification are diabetes, hypertension,\u00a0\u00a0atherosclerosis and kidney disease. The treatment is aimed at the cause. Controlling diabetes and hypertension and following good lifestyle measures can help control calcification. Regular exercise and avoiding fatty foods can help to increase the flow through the calcified arteries.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
