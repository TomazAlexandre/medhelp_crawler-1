I had vague signs among which great thirst as well and few months\u00a0\u00a0later, although not diagnosed with GD (yet) took my glucose tolerance test and it came out fine towards \"funny\" as my doc said. This despite the fact that I am thin, I don't eat many sweets and had no diabetes in my family. But metabolism can change during pregnancy...So just keep an eye on it and any other symptoms.",
