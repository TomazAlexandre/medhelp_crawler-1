    "question": "Hi,thank you for this opportunity.\u00a0\u00a0I've recently been diagnosed with high blood pressure, although I'm fairly young (early 40's).\u00a0\u00a0I don't have any risk factors except strong family history.I was sent to a cardiologist, who heard a murmur and concurred with my family Dr. about treating the high blood pressure. (145/95).\u00a0\u00a0I'm having an echo soon.\u00a0\u00a0I have been prescribed Coreg, which has worked great the last couple months.\u00a0\u00a0I feel wonderful!\u00a0\u00a0My cardio said this medicine is also used to treat and has preventative qualities against congestive heart failure.My question is, if I'm using Coreg for HBP, is it reasonable to use long term since it is used primarily for congestive heart failure? Does it have the possibility to cure or prevent HBP or CHF or does it just cover symptoms.Thank you most sincerely,Marching on",
