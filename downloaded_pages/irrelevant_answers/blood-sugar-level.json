            "answer": "Hi there!The normal blood sugar levels for kids are the same as that of an adult i.e. less than 6.1-7 mmol or 110-126 mg/dl, fasting and less than 7.8-10 mmol or 140-180 mg/dl after food.Hope this information is helpful.Take care!",

            "answer": "Hi,the numbers posted above are actually very high and would already be indicative of someone who is close to diabetic.Truely normal blood sugar will be between 70 and 90 at all times, with the average being around 83.\u00a0\u00a0Even after eating a very sweet meal / meal with lots of carbs truly normal blood sugar should not go above 120.Truly normal A1C (a measure of 3 month average blood sugars (blood test)) is 4.1 - 4.6.Children can normally have lower blood sugars than adults, but would not want to see any numbers less than 65 - 70.If your son consistently has numbers that are above 100, it would already be worthwhile getting\u00a0\u00a0him evaluated as early intervention in childhood diabetes can help prevent progression and minimise complications.Hope this helps.",

        {
            "answer": "The values mentioned in the first response are 'upper cut off limits' and hence normal values correspond to 'less than' these values. Lower values upto 3.3-3.9 mmol/ 60-70 mg/dl would not warrant an evaluation. Though technically 'fasting blood sugar levels' may be 'slightly' lower in children, using these minor differences have not been found to be of value in establishing a diagnostic criteria for DM.",

            "answer": "With all due respect, I believe your first post states higher than normal blood sugar readings.\u00a0\u00a0I have been a diabetic for 18 years and my doctor would not want to see values this high.\u00a0\u00a0140-180 two hours after eating would be too high.\u00a0\u00a0Your stated values of fasting blood sugar readings are high, according to my doctor.\u00a0\u00a0She would like to see them ideally, be between 70 and less than 100,",

        {
            "answer": "Yes, these are high values. The first post reads that normal values correspond to \"less than\" these. In fact values 'between' the ones mentioned (110-126 fasting and 140-180 postprandial) are pre-diabetic and only lower values are considered normal. Ideally I would like to see fasting values below 100 and postprandial values below 130 as well, but an occasional high of 109 fasting and 139 post postprandial would not be considered to be of significance, as per the diagnostic criteria. In fact when we talk about the pre-diabetic values, these individuals do not have diabetes, but have a high chance of developing diabetes in future and may requires changes (lifestyle/ medications).",
