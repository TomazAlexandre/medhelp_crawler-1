            "answer": "Honey,I'm so sorry you are having problems, but you know we aren't doctors and cannot possibly diagnose you.Let me understand something...you no longer have Diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0 To what does your doctor attribute this?\u00a0\u00a0Your blood pressure isn't high enough to be causing dizziness in most people, but everyone is different...I get dizzy when my BP is 150/100..Please do not take offense at this, but all of your issues would probably be resolved if you lost weight.\u00a0\u00a0You didn't say how tall you are, but 300 lbs is not a healthy weight for anyone.Have you cut out all sodium?\u00a0\u00a0What is your diet like?If you've tried to lose weight through dieting, and cannot, have you talked to your doctor about other options? (lap band, gastric bypass, etc.)You are way too young to be having issues like this...and if you don't get your health in control, it could very likely get worse.You stated that you had a chemical stress test.\u00a0\u00a0Why didn't they have you do treadmill test?\u00a0\u00a0Is your mobility compromised?Do you get any sort of daily exercise?\u00a0\u00a0 Walking is the gentlest, safest, and most wonderful thing you can do for your body.\u00a0\u00a0 Just start out small...5 minutes a day...then after 2 weeks, increase your walking time by a minute or two per day, every week.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You'll be amazed at how much better you will feel.If i were you, losing weight would be my #1 priority.\u00a0\u00a0See a GOOD nutritionist and start keeping a food journal...write down everything you put in your mouth..even gum.DON'T fall for gimmicks...pills that claim to help you lose weight (they are dangerous; all of them...or they are scams).Also, avoid fad diets.\u00a0\u00a0Weight Watchers, imo, is still the gold standard for a solid, healthy approach to eating and getting to a healthier weight.Congratulations for coming here.\u00a0\u00a0 I think there is a weight loss forum also...did you post there?Good luck honey.-Robin",

            "answer": "I know losing weight will alleviate all these problems. I have taken the initiative towards adopting a healthier lifestyle . I am in the process of trying to learn more about the diseases I Have and I still have diabetes however the doctor took me off metformin because it was making me feel worse. I signed up for a gym today, to start with cardio. I realize I am too young for these problems which is why I am seeking out any possible ways to help gain some more knowledge on this. I am 5\"3 in height. I have started eating right\u00a0\u00a0but I need to really start making a menu plan that includes all foods I can eat how much sodium I'm allowed per day, etc...\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure why they didn't use a treadmill I have no issues walking, I've made small changes towards parking further away from anywhere I go . I'm just scared because the dizziness seems to be impairing me from being able to do more than I want",

            "answer": "Have you told your doc about the dizziness?\u00a0\u00a0 You have diabetes and are not taking any meds...I'm wondering if your blood sugar is fluctuating...very low OR very high sugar will make you dizzy.The best way to lose weight is to go slowly, and try to cut out junk food, candy, ALL soda, and snacks like chips, crackers, etc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Try to eat as low carb as possible:Here is a sample of what I'm eating (I'm trying to lose 20 pounds.)\u00a0\u00a0This has worked well for me before:Breakfast:Oatmeal with a LITTLE bit of honeyBlueberries (fresh; a 1/2 cup)ORTHREE Egg White Omelet with any veggies (I roast them the night before; broccoli, spinach, mushrooms)Lunch:Huge Salad made up of any veggies you like:\u00a0\u00a0Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, cukes, shredded carrots, sliced red onion, raw mushroom, green or red pepper...with low fat salad dressing, and 1/2 cup of tuna on top. (no mayo)Dinner:Any kind of fish, chicken, or turkey.\u00a0\u00a0I'll roast a 1/2 chicken breast with olive oil and herbs.Huge pile of roasted veggies (I love to roast brussel sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower...drizzle generously with olive oil, a little bit of salt.\u00a0\u00a0350 for 30 minutes.Snacks:\u00a0\u00a0If I'm starving, I will eat sugar free jello, or 2 cups hot air popped corn, or baby carrots. (lots of chewing...which is good for you!)And the secret:\u00a0\u00a0WATER, WATER, WATER.\u00a0\u00a0 You're supposed to drink an ounce of water for every pound you weigh.\u00a0\u00a0I currently weigh 145 so I try and drink over a gallon of waterAvoid:\u00a0\u00a0diet soda:\u00a0\u00a0they contain caffeine (bad for your BP) and the artificial sweetners are not good for you either.Be careful with: Juices:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I dont' drink juice.\u00a0\u00a0Too much sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Instead I drink water, (ice-cold, with slices of lemons, limes, and oranges.) or herb tea...I love to make my own ice-tea (mint, chammomile, etc.)You can do weight watchers online now...they have coaches and on-line forums.Writing out a menu plan every day is SMART...good for you.\u00a0\u00a0If you're too tired to cook on any given night, go for a Lean Cuisine.\u00a0\u00a0They're not the best choice, but better than giving in and ordering a pizza (boy have i been THERE!)Good luck with the gym.\u00a0\u00a0I simply cannot exercise in front of people...I used to run, then my joints said \"no more\" so I switched to a stationary bike.\u00a0\u00a0It's non-impact, and I could watch tv and do a 1/2 hour in no time.Eventually, I grew tired of it, and bought an elliptical.\u00a0\u00a0They are hard...I used to be able to do an HOUR...but then the high BP creeped up on me, and my meds are making me so darned tired.\u00a0\u00a0I can barely do 30 mins 3X a week....which is not enough.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm hoping the tiredness is a side effect of the meds that will go away.You're going to do great, I can feel it.\u00a0\u00a0 Keep in touch!Hugs,-Robin",

Shaking the food addiction is easy, look at what you are eating and eat like described above.\u00a0\u00a0It's not complicated, believe me.\u00a0\u00a0Please, eliminate fast food and restaurant food, it is full of salt.\u00a0\u00a0Be a role model to your little one and start fixing salads with low fat/salt dressing, Olive oil, with balsamic vinegar and mustard is a great low fat/good fat dressing.\u00a0\u00a0You are right, you are a crossroad where you could lose your life or save your life.\u00a0\u00a0Talk to a dietician, get on a plan, and live with it.\u00a0\u00a0Bariatric surgery is a wonderful option once you can show you have the fortitude to stay on a diet.\u00a0\u00a0I doubt they would accept you if you back-slide, so to speak.\u00a0\u00a0It is up to you.\u00a0\u00a0Once you lose the weight you can address diabetes, heart issues, if necessary.\u00a0\u00a0Many of us has won this battle,\u00a0\u00a0you can too.\u00a0\u00a0Keep\u00a0\u00a0us informed.",

Being overweight is the easy thing to blame but not necessarily the sole cause. I am writing this because I gave up smoking a year ago and I know that if I was still smoking now, then the doctor would have told me it is because I am smoking.Just a thought, obviously it is important to be healthy but even getting down to a healthy weight may not solve.",

    "question": "Hi, I am a 29 year old female , 300 lbs, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. It took a lot for me just to actually openly say that in a forum like this. but here goes I have been on a path towards better health, I went pretty much my whole life never taking my health into consideration and now that I have recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure reality has set in and made me realize that I am not longer able to be in denial that I have a problem. I knew that I wasnt headed in the right direction all these years, but I had little to no self control. Food just always seemed more understanding then anything, and I cant believe how out of control I allowed myself to get. But I am a mother of an 8 year old and its time I start setting a better example for her. So I am currently trying to gain more education about nutrition and these two awful diseases i have at such a young age. I thought I would mention that before I go on about my question. So back in October I had started taking metformin twice a day 500 mg ... but i wasnt very consistent with it, i barely took it because of the side effects as far as going to the bathroom like crazy. and I was also put on 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide for my bp, to see if a water pill could help reduce it before I had started an actual medication. but again with that i wasnt consistent because I always felt really awful cramps in my legs i was also put on an oral contraceptive called alesse because i was also diagnosed with a cyst on my right ovary, so my ob wanted to see if the pill would help shrink it(this med i was taking as prescribed) but in december i started taking my water pill and metformin medication religiously as prescribed and i later had to receive iron infusions because i started to get severly anemic, and in january my potassium levels were very low, causing my fingers and toes to always cramp and stick together, it was weird, I also started to feel extreme faint feelings i was driving and nearly fainted behind the wheel and had to go to emergency where the dr just said that i had vertigo and needed to follow up with my doctor. i wasnt convinced it was vertigo because i had it before when i was 25 and the room did not feel like it was spinning i felt like i was going to collapse at any moment. in january i was put on potassium pills, and given a bp medication amlodipine. which helped lower my bp from the 180/90 range to the 149/90 range. and the ob discontinued the birth controls saying it was contributing to my high bp. and one night while driving in january i nearly fainted behind the wheel again this time with my daughter in the car! i go to emergency and they kept me over night to monitor my heart they did some contrast test to see if i was having a pulmonary embolism because i felt pressure in my chest as well. I also went for a ct scan and chest xray along with a 24 hour blood pressure/heart eko. and they also did a stress test where they injected me with something that would make my heart race and all tests came back normal, potassium levels were back up. my doctor just took me off water pill amlodopine and metformin. i am now just taking lisinopril and .25 mg of xanax as needed because i am not sure if those feelings are anxiety related or something else. the other day at work from the moment i woke up i felt dizzy, off balance and weak, i went to work my eyes started to blur and i felt the fainting feeling coming on again was brought to emergency all blood tests were normal, i dont know what to do anymore its interfering with driving, work, and im afraid. my doctor is ordering a vitamin d test for monday and some more fasting labs. when i got to the er my sugar levels were normal my blood pressure was elevated to 156/90 but later back down to 130/70 laying down and sitting up and 127/70 standing. oxygen levels clear... my question is what else could i suggest looking into? i am always staying hydrated",
