            "answer": "I was diagnosed at age 35.\u00a0\u00a0I am now well into my mid fifties and going strong.Look around for diabetes support groups and see if you can join one.\u00a0\u00a0Having others around you that are going through the same thing or similar to you can be a great help.Next, start taking care of yourself.\u00a0\u00a0Listen to your doctor's advice (I'm bad at that myself!) and follow your diet, keep up on your excersize and take whatever meds you are put on religiously.\u00a0\u00a0Lastly measure and keep a record of your blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Knowing what your blood sugars are doing is a Godsend as far as I am concerned.\u00a0\u00a0Some meters actually internally graph your measurements and can be downloaded from so your doctor can have something to look at during routine visits. Trending is a plus.Don't despair.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At 30 your life is far from being over.\u00a0\u00a0Your gonna die, but it might take 40, 50 or sixty years for it to happen. :-)",
