            "answer": "600 is also high but manageable. This could be as simple as your diet, cut out the empty carbs like breads, pastas and sugars as well as anything that metabolizes as sugar. Also, if you drink, stop as alcohol metabolizes as sugar.You can also try a fenofibrate to help lower your tgl's, they are safe and very effective.Good luck,Jon",
