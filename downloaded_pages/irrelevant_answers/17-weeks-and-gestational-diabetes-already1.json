            "answer": "That's why I failed my one hour is because I drank apple juice like 10 minutes before I took mine..the 1 hour test isn't very accurate anyway..the 3 hour is..I failed my one hour blood draw from my three hour test but that was it..you have to fail two of the blood draws to fail the three hour test..all of my numbers were normal except for my one hour blood draw",

    "question": "At my 16 weeks app Dr told me that I had +2 glucose on urine, that same morning she sent me to do the 1 hr glucose test, I failed my one hour with 156 and cut off being 140 ( but that morning I had sugary breakfast) idk if it would affect my results! Yesterday I went to do my 3 hr test and I'm so desperate to get my results back! What I hate about the clinic its that they took a whole week to call me and tell me that I had failed my 1 hr, what am I supposed to do or eat while I get my 3 hr results back??",
