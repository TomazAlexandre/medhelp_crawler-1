            "answer": "I had hip bursitis in my right hip after in a car accident. The greater trochanter bursitis was caused from injury. After severe swelling the tingling in my foot was also very apparent. I believe it was a result or impeachment on blood flow. After a year of misdiagnosis and relying heavily on my left leg. I have now developed greater trochanteric bursitis on my left leg and yes I can concur that I have tingling in my left foot now but related to the swelling. These doctors are unwilling to listen and assume too much.",
