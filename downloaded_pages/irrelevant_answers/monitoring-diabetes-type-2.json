            "answer": "Sounds like you are doing well! You say your glucose levels are \"stable at around 110\". By that do you mean fasting or postprandial? You need to monitor both. Diabetes does progress so just keep track of it and keep up the good work. If you see increase in your fasting and post prandial numbers that is when you might want to go back to the specialist.",

            "answer": "Diabetes is progressive, but only if you let it progress to your complications and demise. Thinking that diabetes is progressive is not only wrong, it\u2019s self-defeating.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s certainly true that diabetes used to progressively worsen with most everyone and still does with many of us progressive, but only if you let it progress to your ruin.Diabetes is not progressive with the right diet and enough exercise. Some people think that\u2019s hard. But in one sense it\u2019s easy. It\u2019s the lifestyle that anyone, with or without diabetes needs to follow to maintain optimal health. With good health everything you do is easier.",
