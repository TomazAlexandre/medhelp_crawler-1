            "answer": "In my experience if there is a problem, or even a potential problem they will let you know.At different times in a babies growth, different areas will measure ahead or behind. It happens all the time. For example, when they did my little guys' measurements at his 20 week anatomy scan his abdomen was ahead, head was ahead, legs a bit behind (I don't remember if this is exactly accurate, but you get the idea).\u00a0\u00a0Every baby is different and they are all very normal. They have all these standaradized measurements, and I have yet to hear of someone saying their baby was exactly on. You will often hear women say I am measuring ahead or behind.\u00a0\u00a0 Also keep in mind that measurement by ultrasound is somewhat innacurate.\u00a0\u00a0At this stage all they are trying to do is get an idea of babies weight, checking things like amniotic fluid, positioning, etc. In fact, they don't even attempt to date pregnancies by ultrasound after first trimester. Just like children grow at different rates, so do our babies.\u00a0\u00a0Next ultrasound they may tell you his head is a week behind..it changes constantly.\u00a0\u00a0Chances are she just mentioned it as a point of interest, nothing more.\u00a0\u00a0It is highly unlikely this is anything at all to be concerned about.\u00a0\u00a0Congrats on your impending arrival and best of luck during delivery!!!!!!",

            "answer": "I agree with everything else already said but also wanted to comment that it is extremely common for mothers with diabetes to have larger than average babies, also ultrasounds are not absolutely accurate and genetics plays a role too. At 36 weeks and 4 days gestation\u00a0\u00a0(and me with high sugar levels) my second baby was measuring approx 41 weeks gestation and the weight estimate was 9lb 2 oz. He was born 3 days later by c section and was 8lbs 10oz and absolutely perfect.\u00a0\u00a0For his gestational age he was larger than average, both my babies were infact; I have also had a 32 weeker that weighed in at 4lb 15oz.I am tiny at only 5ft but there are alot of tall people on my husbands side of the family.If your doctor had concerns about your babies measurements they would be calling your wife back for further test.Try to relax and enjoy this amazing time and congratulations!",

    "question": "My wife is 39 years old and has diabetes. I am 50. We are expecting our first child November 1.\u00a0\u00a0Right now my wife is in her 29th week. Yesterday, we had a sonogram and the doctor said our baby's head is the size it should be at 33 weeks, which means our baby's head is four weeks bigger than it should be.\u00a0\u00a0This sounds terrifying to me. Can you tell me what all this means, and if there are complications, what can we do to stave off any possible difficulties? My wife's doctor didn't say anything about it one way or another. She only mentioned it, which means she mentioned it and it isn't worth dwelling on or she mentioned it and she didn't detail it because she wants to spare us the misery of knowing. I know I sound paranoid, but I'm really worried. Can you shed any light on this? Thanks. W in Seoul.",
