            "answer": "Hello,This sounds like polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).\u00a0\u00a0One does not have to be infertile to have this.One drug which can be very helpful for this is metformin, which may also assist in weight loss.Weight loss with PCOS can be very hard.You need to have your FT3 and FT4 tested (not T3/T4) to see that these are in normal range (preferably the middle or slightly higher).\u00a0\u00a0Many people with PCOS also have thyroid issues, which make the wieght loss even harder.Also have you been tested for diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0The doctor should run a HBA1C and a FBS and preferably also a Fasting Insulin to screen for this.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is also far more common with PCOS.fLow carb diet can also be helpful to management.I do think you should see an endocrinologist and get a full work-up.",

            "answer": "Hi,I have also thought it could be PCOS but I was hoping it wasn't. Both of my parents have diabetes and all my relatives have high blood pressure. I do not have either. I have not been tested for diabetes but I measure my blood sugar and it has always been normal. I did gain my weight in a really weird way because now I have a big belly and as I know, diabetics and pre-diabetics gain weight in that area. I would like to have another baby in 2 years and it is time for me to do something because I am afraid it is dangerous to get pregnant in my condition and I have also heard that high testosterone level may trigger miscarriages. If I start taking Metformin, will I have to take that for the rest of my life? Can it have any negative effects on my pregnancy? Thank you for your input and the useful info on what examinations to ask for! I appreciate it.",

            "answer": "Hello,it is good that you don't have high blood pressure or diabetes, but the family history means that you should be proactive in preventing them.You would not necessarily need to take metformin for life.\u00a0\u00a0MEtformin has been shown to have positive effects on ability to get and stay pregnant for women with PCOS.Make sure they've checked your thyroid properly.\u00a0\u00a0Hypothyroid is also correlated with PCOS.Weight loss will help - though surely it is hard.\u00a0\u00a0Follow a low carb diet plan with most of your carbs coming from non-starchy veges.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise every day. At least 30 minutes of cardio, more if you can.Be proactive with this.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with PCOS many years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I also have hypothyroid and diabetes now.\u00a0\u00a0But I also have 2 healthy girls.\u00a0\u00a0I consider myself healthy despite all and live a busy and satisfying life.\u00a0\u00a0I do continue to struggle with weight.\u00a0\u00a0Currently 80 kg, and accep[t that managing it will be a lifelong challenge which I can't give up on.",

            "answer": "I just want to comment on the facial hair problem as I also had this for a long time and I do NOT have PCOS:I've had this issue for 15 years, I believe it got terrible when I was more stressed. I did electrolysis for a long time until recently, when less hair would grow. But it still did, which was annoying.After I found out about being hypo, my new thyroid doctor recommended taking Progesterone for 2 weeks per month... And voila! No more facial hair after the 3rd month! Amazing. Not sure how it regulates the hormones, but if you do not have PCOS, I would give this a try. It amazes me how all doctors I've been to, gynecologists or PCPs, over all those years, never suggested anything like this. Ugh! Not sure what these people are taught in med school :(",

            "answer": "Thank you both! You guys really provided some great pieces of info as I am new to this \"PCOS-thyroid\" issue.Thethinme: is this progesterone med something that you will have to take long term? Will you stop now at 3 months and it will not grow back? I guess it is not good for someone who wants to get pregnant soon though? I have been to a doctor and he prescribed a med for my hair growth that I couldn't even take because of breastfeeding and only the pharmacist told me that this med would cause all kinds of severe problems. That is why I try to be careful with hormone medication.I wish you both the best of luck!",

    "question": "I'm a 26-year-old female with the following symptoms:-excess hair on my face (it has been getting worse and worse, it mainly grows under my chin in a line and I have tried permanent hair removal too but it did not work at all, it has become so strong that I will need to shave if it doesn't change)- hair loss on scalp-sudden weight gain that I cannot lose no matter what. My weight doesn't go down by a few lbs either., I am currently 200 lbs, I used to be 130 and I eat healthy.-depression-dry hair, dry skin no matter how I take care of them-extreme dizziness, when I am having it, I have a slight sore throat and my glands get a lot bigger-high cholesterol level-fatigueWhen they did blood work on me, only my cholesterol and my testosterone hormone levels were very high. My blood sugar and blood pressure are normal. T3, T4 were normal. My menstrual cycles have always been normal and I have a child, I am therefore not infertile but I am afraid something is wrong and I should not get pregnant at this weight and with these symptoms. Could you please tell me what the problem may be and if I should see a doctor specializing in endocrinology or rather in internal medicine? Thank you in advance.",
