            "answer": "Seroquel is often used these days as an augmentation drug for all kinds of things, but it looks like a lot of it was fraudulent marketing by the manufacturer.\u00a0\u00a0So it's hard to tell how well it works for other than the two things it was approved for.\u00a0\u00a0The manufacturer isn't only being sued, the federal gov't has also taken action.\u00a0\u00a0Which doesn't mean it's illegal for the doc to prescribe it for anxiety, it just means it isn't approved for that and the company didn't study it for that, just marketed it for that.\u00a0\u00a0Like the first answer said, do your homework on this one.",
