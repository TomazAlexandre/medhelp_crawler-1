            "answer": "Hello,Increased frequency of urination can be physiological or disease-related, and include excessive intake of liquids, diuretic substances (including tea, caffeine, alcohol, certain drugs), anxiety, exposure to cold, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus (central or nephrogenic), urinary tract infections or obstruction, etc to name a few more common ones.I suggest you to take opinion of your doctor who would do a clinical examination and advice for needful tests (such as routine urinanalysis, blood glucose test, blood & urinary osmolalities, ultrasonography of renal system, etc).The painless growths can be due to irritated hair follicles, cysts or genital warts. Please get it examined from a dermatologist to confirm the diagnosis.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
