I am not satisfied until I get the damn scab off of my skin.A few years ago, I got nailed with cellulitis in my right leg. It was terrible. I caught it in time and it was a good thing because i could have lost a leg.After that, I began to stop picking at sores but recently, I started up again. it might sound terrible but it is actually enjoyable until it begins to bleed. I know alot of other people that do this too, so its not just a few people.",

            "answer": "well i understand how that would be addicting but i think you should replace it with something else....when you start picking just remember how much you hate it and how mad your going to get at yourself and realize your better than that(: maybe you should start reading because most people find that they ignore a lot of things such like a trance of which your focused on just one thing",

            "answer": "Thanks for writing me! I have cellulitis now. The more I scratch the worse it gets. I wish I could stop picking the sores I have made but I can't.I found a therapist yesterday who deals with people who pick and i called\u00a0\u00a0but they only except cash.

I had no idea their were people as bad as me out there.\u00a0\u00a0Did you know their are even support groups for this?",

    "question": "I started picking my sores when I was young. I think about 6 or 7.\u00a0\u00a0I remember using a razor blade to get the scab off. I also use pins,tweezers,teeth. Over the years It's only gotten worse. I'm obcesed. I look for sores to pick. It hapends\u00a0\u00a0all threw the day and night. If I see it or feel it - it has to go. It's like if their is a scab on the sore it has to be taken off. Sometimes I like to see the blood. I like the feeling I get when I'm picking. When it's over I'm so mad at myself. I keep bandaids with me all the time,bathroom, purse, car. I'm so scarred of loosing a limb. I have diabetes and I can't stop. I'v tried all kind of meds and nothing has worked. I'm working with a Psych Dr. and this makes me even more bummed that we can't find the right meds to make me stop.\u00a0\u00a0I need help!!!!! It drives me crazy.\u00a0\u00a0I worry all the time.\u00a0\u00a0HELP!!!",
