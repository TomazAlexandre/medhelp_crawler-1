            "answer": "I'm quite puzzled by your post, to be honest. Prediabetes (sometimes also referred to as insulin resistance) is diagnosed by either fasting blood sugar or A1C. In order to be diagnosed with pre-diabetes you need a fasting blood sugar from 100-125, or an A1C over 5.7. Your blood sugars if anything, are too low. You could be suffering from hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) which sometimes precedes diabetes. Or if your lows (under 70) are after how carb meals it could be something called reactive hypoglycemia. I am also very puzzled why your doctor would prescribe medication for someone whose blood sugar never rises above the 90s??? That is totally within the normal range! Even if your doctor anticipates you having insulin resistance and proceeding to develop diabetes you aren't there yet. It would be much more appropriate to recommend a combination of diet for weight loss, cutting carbs and exercise. I'm going to research Insulin Resistance to see if I'm missing something, but that is what I'm seeing now. You need to ask your doctor to explain his treatment and what he is seeing in your medical picture.As for safety and Glucophage. It is the most commonly prescribed medication for diabetes. It does have some side effects which are considered minor but can be annoying. They are mostly gastrointestinal and some people find they improve with time. I definitely think you need some answers.",

            "answer": "I just did some reading in a couple books and I understand that Insulin Resistance Syndrome CAN be diagnosed without pre-diabetic glucose numbers. It states that about 30% of all Americans have IRS (which make it easy to gain weight and hard to lose) of which 30-40% of them will develop Type 2 diabetes. It further states that \"positive lifestyle canges can reduce the likelihood of IRS progressing to Type 2 diabetes when started early enough, and can often cause a marked reductin in health risk at any point.\" In other words, weight loss, carb reduction and exercise! I still think meds are premature. Since you also have thyroid condition, you might want to get another opinion from an endo rather than just your PCP who seems a bit overeager to prescribe meds imho.",

            "answer": "Sorry, Dani, I didn't intend to scare you more! Now that you explain the doctor's thinking it does make some sense. He feels that you are stuck where you are because the insulin resistance is keeping you from being able to lose weight and he feels you are going to have increasing blood sugars due to your weight. So he is doing a \"preemptive strike\" by treating the insulin resistance Before the blood sugars rise into the pre-diabetes zone. I'm just assuming you that your thyroid is managed and stable so that is not a factor in keeping you from losing weight. What I would do is start the medication as the doctor suggests but also do self-management by lowering your carbs as much as possible and getting regular exercise. Doctors rarely recommend low carb diets, even for diabetics as they use a very outdated ADA recommendation for diet. If you do those things in combination with the medication you might, at some point, be able to stop using the meds. Make sense? I'm also sending you a pm with a website where there are a lot more diabetics and pre-diabetics and you can also pose your situation to them and get a lot more perspectives than just mine, and perhaps someone who has been in a similar situation.",

            "answer": "I'm sorry but I don't know anything anbout insulin levels and resistance. You might ask her what that means that she thinks you still have resistance but you are well within the optimal range on your labs. I would say it's a judgement call if you want to try for awhile to lose weight on your own and then take it if you can't or just go ahead and take it for awhile. Also, you might try posting your question on the website I sent you as there are a lot more people with different experiences on there and someone will know more about it.",
