            "answer": "Hi it's very\u00a0\u00a0sad when Drs use the term anxiety and stress, not to mention send you top a therapist, just cause they can't figure out whats wrong with you.I am no Dr., but I do beleive that not enough research has been done on you, for example there is a Bladder deasease called Interstitial Cystitis which occurs mostly in women, however men also get this and the symptoms sounds very similar to what you have (I\u00a0\u00a0know cause I have it). Cystospy's don't always show any damage and there for a diagnoses becomes harder to find.Blood work will give you no indication of this deasese, however go the Interstitial Cystitis web site and read more.\u00a0\u00a0Food has a lot to do with it and there are many treatments out there that can help.Yes stress makes it worse, but more horable than that is going to a Dr. to find an answer to the Hell you are going through and to be told that it may all be in your head. I wish you the best of luck. Don't give up on yourself.",

            "answer": "Sounds like you might have a problem with kidney stones.\u00a0\u00a0It is common to miss stones that are so small they are like sand.\u00a0\u00a0These often pass through the urine without pain and are missed in blood tests and most radiology tests.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest two things.\u00a0\u00a0First you can catch your urine and filter it though special filters to see if you collect any sand.\u00a0\u00a0This sand can be tested to see if it is sand from stones.\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, you can get an ultrasound done to see of the tech can detect any stones in the kidneys.\u00a0\u00a0If stones are not your problem, then look to your diet.\u00a0\u00a0Frequent urination is often the result of drinking drinks with caffeine like coffee or soda. Another problem you may be having is with sugar substitutes from diet drinks and foods.\u00a0\u00a0You can see an allergist to see if you may have a sensitivity to them or just give them up for about a month and see if that doesnt' fix your problem. good luck",

    "question": "Had to pee every hour for the last 4 years. The kicker is I've never had to get up at night. Have seen GP and 3 Urologist and have no answers still.Have had cystocopy, had catheter in bladder, had dye ran thru kidney and bladder, full physcial with bloodwork, urine checked 30 times.\u00a0\u00a0Every single test/bloodwork was normal and urine has been 100% normal every time.\u00a0\u00a0Have changed my diet, what I drink with no change at all.Prostate has been checked more times that I wish to remember and has always been normal.\u00a0\u00a0Tired every OAB med available.\u00a0\u00a0Urologist finally told me this week there is nothing else he can do and it has to be a stress/anxiety deal.He mentioned the only other possible diagnosis he could come up with is perhaps early MS, but I show no other symptoms so that is highly unlikely.I am a mellow/laid back guy and have no high anxiety/stress/guilt etc..\u00a0\u00a0He suggested maybe I see a shrink to see if there is a psychological problem.I don't know exactly what to do next?",
