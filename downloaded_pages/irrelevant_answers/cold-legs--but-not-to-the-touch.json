    "question": "i'm not sure where else to put this question, so since i am female, i figured this would be a good start. i suppose i am more or less looking for reassurance on this whole situation.the other day, i felt like my left leg was numb, but it wasn't. it feels like my leg is FREEZING cold. but when i touch it, it feels the same as my right leg. when i put a cold compress on my leg, it sort of burns, which tells me it may be a nerve issue?because i don't care much for dr. google, i figured i would ask here and see if anyone else has been through this. and if so, what happened?thank you SO much in advance.",
