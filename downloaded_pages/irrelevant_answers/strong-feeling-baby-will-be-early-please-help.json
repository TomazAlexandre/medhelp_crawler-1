            "answer": "I don't know they generally won't move the due date unless the weeks are more than 2 off...do you have gestational diabetes or a high amniotic fluid index? these can both make babies larger than average BUT not change their maturity level.my son measures about a week ahead in growth but my due date hasn't budged because I know exactly when my last period was AND his maturity is par with my due date even if his size is a little big.some babies are just big...and I'm not quite 35wks and he's been dropped for 2 weeks and I've been having strong random contractions, as well as serious nesting. BUT...I know the dates are right. Sometimes big babies come earlier simply because they run out of room and the pressure they exert causes dilation and water breaking, but as long as your EDD isn't more than 2wks from the dates on the u/s it'll stay the same in 90% of pregnancies. Your due date is actually anywhere from 38wks-42wks..closer to 38wks for successive pregnancies and closer to 42 for first pregnancies although very few women go that late.is this your first baby? I know with my daughter I kept telling them that I thought she was going to come earlier, and she was measuring big on all the ultrasounds..and I knew my LMP but I was convinced they were wrong and kept getting upset...well, she came ON HER DUE DATE and only weighed 7lbs6oz...so they generally know what they're talking about, lol.",

            "answer": "i just cant understand the time span between 6 weeks 1 day on November 30, and the 7 weeks 5 days on December 21st...i feel like they aren't paying attention. I understand not moving the dates, but they just act like i make up the first ultrasound every time i go in",

    "question": "I am still confused about when i am to have this child. My doctors are so unhelpful- here is my story:-took first pregnancy test on November 20th 2009, it immediately said pregnant.-i had no idea when my last period was in october, but i did notice one day of light bleeding sometime, found it odd because i never even soaked a tampon( maybe in the first week of november???)-First doctors appointment on November 30th- baby measured .39cm, and had strong heartbeat- dr. dated it a 6 wk 1 day old pregnancy.-Next appointment, December 21st-receptionist made me write a LMP, i told her about last appointment, said they still needed to put something in computer, so i wrote Oct 28 2009, just because i figured it was fine from the last appointment.\u00a0\u00a0A different doctor started to exam me as if it was my first appointment...they did another ultrasound, and it said the baby measured 8 weeks 4 days, but she said i was only 7 wk 5 days pregnant, because of the date i made up for my period!\u00a0\u00a0I tried to explain, but they had no record of the first appointment- said they must have lost my info....-Ever since then i have no clue what is going on- they get very irritated with me when i try to explain, almost like i am trying to tell them they are wrong )which i think they are)- they scheduled my U/S March 12th to determine sex, and when i showed up said they forgot because i was not far enough along from my LMP date...i was super upset.-At a checkup April 21, according to my LMP made-up date, i was supposed to measure 25 weeks, and i measured 27! DUH! They seemed so shocked-Next ultrasound to check on this \"situation\" was May 14th where i was told they baby measured 10 days or so big.-STILL every time i go in they have no clue why i am bigger, why baby is bigger- i feel like they are very irresponsible and i have a GUT feeling that this baby is going to be here even earlier than the first u/s date of july 25th. The other date they gave was 8/5....none of it makes sense! If i had been 7 wk. 5 days on December 21, that means on November 20th that they saw a heartbeat at 4 wk 5 days- HOW CAN THEY NOT CATCH THIS!-Its June 10th, i have horrible cramps, my belly dropped, i am nesting like crazy- i say one more month, and i am sooooo afraid they will not be ready for me because its like i am a new patient each time i go!!! So when does this make my due date, conception date,....i am so frustrated....",
