            "answer": "Hi,Yes I have had four abnormal MRIs. They told me I do have lesions, although I dont know how many. They have told me some have gone away, and some new ones have come. This last MRI they just told me I still have the white spots. And That one of them is really big. I have been told by my neurologist that he thinks the lesions are from my high blood pressure and my diabetes. What kind of Neuro exam are you talking about? I am not sure if I have had one done or not. I have had so many tests done I cant remember them all.My neurologist says he doesnt think I have MS, and that he thinks these white spots are from my history of high blood pressure and diabetes like I said before. But these lesions or white spots sure do affect my memory and my daily life.I cant make decisions, I cant talk right sometimes, Iam scared to go to town alone, I cant remember a conversation right after I have had it, and things like this.My family really has to help me just to get through a day! I am 47 years old, not 97. Maybe I am just grabbing at the stars, and its all in my head! So to speak! Ha! Thank you for your kindness and God Bless You! :)",

            "answer": "Hello! I am not sure if the lesions go away and return with diabetes or high blood pressure. They do with MS. Do you know where the lesions are? MS has certain areas and sizes that are classic. Also, the cognitive thing.....I think you definitely want to see neuro, and definitely have all the exams. You mentioned evoked potentials testing...which one did you have? eyes? all?I don't know what you have because I am not a doctor. I am only newly diagnosed myself. However, I can understand how frightening it is to have the lesions, and the cognitive problems and not be helped! It is fine if they don't say it's MS....but, they should be trying to find out what it is and get you the appropriate help! I assume you are on meds for high blood pressure and type II diabetes?-Dee",

            "answer": "Hi, I am kinda in the same boat as you are. I have brain lesions that are in the \"classic pattern\" of ms. and still am not sure if it is ms that accounts for the things I have been doctoring for in the past 5 years or so. I am having a lumbar puncture this coming wed. and I am hoping that if I do indeed have ms. it shows up in the fluid. I know it is very possible to have a normal lumbar puncture and also have ms, just as it is possile to have a normal brain mri and have ms.It is I am learning (from this forum) a hard disease to pin down, especially if you do not have the classic balance problems.",

            "answer": "Oh I forgot to ask you, do you have hyper-reflexes? My neurosurgeon told me when he found out that I had them that there are only 2 things that cause hyper reflexes and they are spinal cord compression or ms. It was then that he told me he wanted me to have a cervical myelogram because he can't see my spinal cord on a mri film (which I brought with me) because I have a titanium plate in my neck from a previous neck surgery. He said that he needed to be sure that there was no spinal cord compression behind the plate. so I am having the myelogram and the lumbar puncture on wed.",
