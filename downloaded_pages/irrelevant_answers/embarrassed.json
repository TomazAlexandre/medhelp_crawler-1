            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed description of the symptoms or a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to comment specifically on the situation. A \u2018leaky gut syndrome\u2019 is not particularly a diagnosis but rather a vague term pointing to a GI issue such as inflammation,\u00a0\u00a0malsorption, GI motility issues etc. It would be best to have this evaluated in detail by a gastroenterologist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.Body odour can be caused due to a number of reasons like poor hygiene, infections (fungal, bacterial or parasitic), hormonal changes during puberty, hyperhydrosis, some metabolic disorders, a few foods like spices garlic etc, stale sweat, gastrointestinal disorders, diabetes, ketoacidosis, urinary tract infection, scurvy etc. In your case if you feel the smell is strong it would be best to get evaluated by a primary care physician for a possible secondary cause so that it can be treated appropriately.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "I'm hoping to get some information and maybe a solution on my problem.\u00a0\u00a0I've developed a very strong sweaty/old smelling body odor and it's been a recent onset.\u00a0\u00a0Along with the bad odor, I was diagnosed with leaky gut syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0It all just sounds so bad.\u00a0\u00a0I've done some research on this syndrome and I could have an excessive amount of toxins in my gut. I'm wondering if anyone could answer this question of, could it be a form of yeast seeping through my pours, and if so, what can I do to correct this?",
