            "answer": "Peripheral neuropathy, in its most common form, causes pain and numbness in your hands and feet. The pain typically is described as tingling or burning, while the loss of sensation often is compared to the feeling of wearing a thin stocking or gloveThe first goal of treatment is to manage the condition causing your neuropathy.The second goal of treatment is to relieve the painful symptoms.Mild symptoms may be relieved by over-the-counter pain medications. For more severe symptoms, your doctor may recommend prescription painkillers. Lignocaine patches also helps in relieving pain.The best way to prevent peripheral neuropathy is to carefully manage any medical condition that puts you at risk. That means controlling your blood sugar level if you have diabetes or talking to your doctor about safe and effective treatments if you think you may have a problem with alcohol.Whether or not you have a medical condition, eat a healthy diet that's rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean protein.Avoid repetitive motions, cramped positions and toxic chemicals, all of which may cause nerve damage.Consult a good neurologist and follow up properly.",
