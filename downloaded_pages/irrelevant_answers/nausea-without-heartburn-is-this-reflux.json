            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Extreme hunger with nausea is seen in basically three conditions. Diabetes, gastritis with acidity and may be reflux and in hyperthyroid states. Hence all 3 conditions will have to be looked into. It is possible to have only nausea as a presenting symptom of acidity. If there is no reflux then chances of heart burn are less.Chronic nausea is also seen in gall bladder or liver infection. Hence if your son does not respond to medication for acidity, then all these conditions will have to be looked into.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you. great info. makes sense...I would think with liver or gallbladder you would see other symptoms....do you think anesthesia / meds could have caused some liver toxicity...on a sub-clinical level. My son is extremely intuitive. Hyper-neurosensitivity issues...all labels cut out of shirts, seams on socks make him nuts, an intense kid...has a 4.2 g.p.a.\u00a0\u00a0junior year of high school. I would think if it were an ulcer he'd have pain.? he also has early satiety...get's full quickly. Your feedback is appreciated...Thank you.",

            "answer": "Hi!Acidity often causes no other symptoms other than intense hunger and nausea. Both these symptoms are more in the morning hours or after long gaps between meals. Yes, some medicines are toxic to liver and can cause a raised liver enzyme levels. Also as I said earlier, diabetes (less likely) should also be checked. Let your son take Prilosec for a week and see if it helps him. If not, then further evaluation may be required. Take care!",

    "question": "Feedback please....I have a 16 y.o son who has nausea x 4 months...has it all the time...worse in the morning. Feels hungry, eats and then during the meal while eating sometimes has to stop because he feels like he will throw up. Has been sedentary past 3 1/2 months while recovering from ankle surgery from a soccer injury...was very active prior.claims the nausea was there prior to the ankle fracture, but has worsened. 6ft tall and weighs 129....lost 5 lbs in 4 months..I was thinking ulcer but he has no pain, no burning, no burping, no belching, but does have a chronic cough...was prescribed prilosec today...which everything i read states it is to decrease stomach acid? How can he have an acid issue and not have heartburn, burping, belching etc?I am grateful for feedback....6",
