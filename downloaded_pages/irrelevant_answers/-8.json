            "answer": "Best way to avoid diabetes is to avoid grains and sugar. Do a search on diabetes and paleo or low carb. Eating foods that cause spikes in insulin such as grains is what leads to diabetes. Watch what you eat - stick to fruits, veggies, meat, dairy, cheese, healthy oils like coconut oil and olive oil and stay away from processed foods and you will see a huge difference in your healthy. you'll keep diabetes away forever. My dad is reversing his diabetes by changing the way he is eating. It is very healthy to eat this way and it is very good for your baby... you aren't failing your baby, you'll be fine. You're a good mom, just by writing and trying to find answers shows me that you care.. as a mom we worry about our child, even before they are here. It's our job to make sure they survive and make it into the world and the best way to insure this happens is through the food we eat. Trust me, it isn't easy.. but it will make all the difference in your health and in your baby's health..",
