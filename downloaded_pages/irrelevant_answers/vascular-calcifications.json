    "question": "I visited my gyn for yearly check up this week. My mammogram results came back fine, but with a notation \"atherosclerotic vascular calcifications.\"\u00a0\u00a0My dr suggested a follow up with my family physician for possible further testing such as an echocardiogram and stress test.\u00a0\u00a0Should I request a referral to a heart specialist?\u00a0\u00a0Background: I am a 59 year old female with active HCV (blood transfusions with child birth in 1973). After 3 years of interferon treatment, I was not able to clear the HCV virus, however my liver biopsy shows only very mild damage.\u00a0\u00a0Other recent tests, glucors: 86 -- no diabetes; cholesterol total is 149, Triglycerides 46; HDL cholesterol is 67; LDL Cholesterol 73; VLDL Cholesterol 9, which my hepatitus dr assured me was good.\u00a0\u00a0NOTE: I did have a number of side effects during treatment with interferon (Pegasus, Ribavirin, etc), including neuropathy.Any suggestions greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!",
