    "question": "Hello- Looking for clues \"outside the HMO box\"....my symptoms have been present sporadically for 5 years. They are left foot: arch burning, big toe pain and the \"meat\" (not a medical term, I know) on the bottom of my feet will feel bruised with out any injury. Left calf: tight muscles. Left hand: palm feels beat up (in the meaty parts), joints hurt, burning sensation. Left arm: muscles/meat feels tender and almost like I have tendonitis. Lower left side of hip- pain and burning.\u00a0\u00a0 A very small amout of copy cat symptoms on right side of body (mostly arch and palm pain)- but not much- seems to be all left.\u00a0\u00a0Also wide spread sporadic \"buzzing sensation\", burning sensation,shooting pains, muscle twitching and mild cramping.\u00a0\u00a0No weakness or real lack of cordination. ALL symptoms will some times completely vanish.....then return some times one at a time, or a few at a time- but they will be gone and every thing seems fine for weeks...then it suddenly comes back (no illness preceding it either). Medical history: Hashimotos and chronic osteomyelitis (in left foot and lower mandable). Medicine: Levathyroid 175mcg daily and herbs for liver (damaged from chronis infection with osteomyelitis). Have never taken any other meds besides- birthcontrol (last taken in 1998), antibiotics and OTC med's and herbs. Age; 37, 2 children.\u00a0\u00a0Test; mri back in 2001, emg back in 2004, neuro exam back in 2004.......all clean -according to same dr.'s who mis-diagnosed osteomyelitis for 17 years....so there is an element of distrust on my part. But even they scratch their heads...so ANY ideas plaese let me know.With kind regards,buzzing and burning",
