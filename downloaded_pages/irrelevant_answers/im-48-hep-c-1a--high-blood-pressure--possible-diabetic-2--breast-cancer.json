            "answer": "I agree, take care of the cancer first, let your cancer docs know you have hepc, but it shouldn't make any difference in treatment. The hepc treatment can wait. Do treat the diabetes asap also, if you have that under control it will help you recover better from the other two. Good luck!",

            "answer": "It depends on how advanced your diseases are. I treated with Sovaldi but relapsed. Then came the breast cancer diagnosis. Had 2 surgeries and then went on to treat Hep C successfully with Harvoni. But mine was a tiny tumor, detected early and removed successfully. Now I am cured of both life threatening diseases. Learn all you can about BC and how far your Hep C has advanced. My wonderful surgeon went to bat for me at the Tumor Board when I refused further chemo or radiation. She understood for a woman my age the 2 most important factors are survivability rates and recurrence rates and the numbers didn't add up for me (less than 1% improvement on both factors.) You are younger and all patients are unique so your scenario will be different, of course. Listen to your docs and research both diseases. A good diet will go a long way towards preventing diabetes. Fresh fruit and veggies, whole grains - all good and liver friendlyKeep us posted and learn to be your own advocate!",
