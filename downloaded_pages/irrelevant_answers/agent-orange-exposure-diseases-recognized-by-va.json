            "answer": "Truly ~ there are many many service connected medical conditions that a lot of Veterans are not aware of.Fortunately, after our Vietnam Veterans waited OVER 30 YEARS!!!, some of the laws have changed in the last few years, ultimately making it easier for the Veteran to receive financial compensation, and medical treatment related to their active duty service.If anyone is interested in finding out how to get connected to medical care, somewhat quickly, depending on the medical condition, and the availability of VA clinic's in your area... contact me! my email is VeteranAdvocate AT Comcast.net or contact me here.I'm working on two claims both for Marines that served in the 70's.One man has waited since 1980 for his benefits. The Board of Veterans Appeals in on the side of this Veteran, and has dished it back to the Regional Office (VA) here in Portland Oregon.I love taking these laws and Making Them Work for the Veteran!That's what they are there for!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So many in the VA system are just so burned out, they should quit. The Veterans care should never be sacrificed b/c someone doesn't know the laws have changed to help the Veteran, or b/c they don't have the energy to follow thru.That's why I volunteer, and will never work for the fed. or state.I'm not bound by their limiting laws.Didn't mean to get carried away.... it's likely my own lupus is the direct result of agent orange exposure. Need to get hooked up with the lupus foundation in OKC and get my own service connect ~ connected!!!In Peace & With Respect ~ Woshi",

            "answer": "When my husband passed away in 1999, we had never heard of agent orange. No need to go to V.A. since we had good insurance. He was diagnosed with CLL.\u00a0\u00a0He also had other symptoms of exposure such as peripheral neuropathy in his hip, leg both feet & in his right arm, hand. Operation for carpal tunnel didn't help & was diagnosed as sciaticia (mispelled?). Then there came the little blisters all over sun exposed areas which hurt, PCT. In 1999, CLL wasn't on the \"list\" so I couldn't get DIC. 2003 it came on the list, I reapplied BUT although his symptoms matched, they said it had to be a V.A. doctor to diagnose it & I can't prove he was in Vietnam since he was stationed in Germany 1963/1964. Odd thing is, is that for the last 2 1/2 months that he was in there, they have him listed as a cook (from a MTB and tank/track vehicle repairman)!! BUT while he was a \"cook\" he went from E-4 to E-5 & got a pay raise. I'm going to try to get all his records if they'll give them ALL to me, have requested them twice & they'll add a few more pages when they send them. He said he was in Vietnam at that time, I can't PROVE anything, it's not on his DD214. He also said it was a quick order for reassignment that came through--something about fires or something.\u00a0\u00a0He hardly ever talked about it & I never pushed it. If anyone knows anything that can help me PLEASE e-mail me at ***@****. Thanks so much.",
