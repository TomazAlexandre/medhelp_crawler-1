            "answer": "I'm 31 weeks into pregnancy #2 and I'm a type 2 diabetic. My experience with #1 is that the last couple weeks of my pregnancy, my sugars were nearly double what they had been throughout the pregnancy. I delivered at 36 +3. My doctor regularly explains to me that the further along in a pregnancy (at least in the 3rd trimester), the sugars are likely to raise & that it has something to do with the placenta and the baby growing out of space. I can't say whether you'll be enduced sooner than later - for pregnancy, #1 my water broke in triage on its own. I wish you all the best. Congratulations!BTW: you may want to look into an endocrinologist as a good percentage of women who have gestational diabetes are likely to develop diabetes, from what I read.",

            "answer": "My mum is a full time insulan dependant diabetic, had GD with all 7 pregnancies. She never went past 37 weeks they induced her. I was boarder line with my\u00a0\u00a0first and have tried to be as careful as possible with this one.... I get my test done in a few weeks.I think as far as what the dr does , it depends on baby and your levels. Mothers with GD are known to have bigger babies. And yes if you have had GD your chances of getting diabetics later in life are higher.Keep us updated, good luck xx",

            "answer": "I had GD with my last pregnancy (possibly this pregnancy too) and was also on insulin. If they can't control your numbers with insulin anymore they may schedule an amnio to see how the baby's lungs are. It's safer to pull the baby out sooner then later in this situation. If your numbers get too out of control, your baby may result in a stillbirth (happened to my cousin). Hopefully increasing your insulin intake will help keep those numbers down. Don't worry about the baby's size either. My son was born 9lbs 6.5oz and I didn't have GD, oppose to my daughter who was born 8lbs 7oz and I had GD.",

    "question": "I'm 37+4. Failed my Glucose test right from the start.. After I started testing blood- 6 times a day, they were still kinda high. Doctor put me on insulin at morning and night.. They were doing really good for a while but the doctor upped my dose Wednesday because they had gotten worse.. From what I can see the last couple days they are still high.. Doctor wants my numbers tomorrow..My question--- do you think the doctor will induce or try upping my dose again for another week??I have an induction date for Aug 9.. But I think if they are bad the doctor would just induce now???Anyone get induced because the insulin wasn't controlling it??",
