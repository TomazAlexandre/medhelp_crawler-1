            "answer": "If you've already explained your level of concern about your symptoms to your doc and feel that you have been blown-off or dismissed or for whatever reason feel that the doc's reply was not enough, then see another doc... seriously...We all want to believe that the doc we're seeing has all the answers and is absolutely committed to our personal needs, but ultimately even the best doc is human and as a human there are innumerable reasons why that person might fall short of our needs from them... so, if you're not getting the answers and/or support from your current doc, see another doc...\u00a0\u00a0yeah, I get the issues of trust as well as of money... BUT... it's YOUR health, YOUR body, YOUR life... isn't that worth seeking out at least one other doc who might be better able to meet your needs for health, wellness, a second opinion?...",
