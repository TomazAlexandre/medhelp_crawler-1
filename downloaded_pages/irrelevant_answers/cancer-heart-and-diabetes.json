            "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear about your condition :(With regards to your question, there is too much missing data to unfortunately give any comments. For example, which artery is blocked, have you had any other tests etc. In many people when a blockage forms, the heart opens tiny arteries called collaterals which give an extra feed to compensate for the loss. This is something which could be happening with your heart at this very minute. I had a total blockage in my left artery at the top, the artery they call the widowmaker, and yet those tiny arteries opened up at the bottom of the vessel, getting blood from the right side of the heart.What is the reason they decided to do an angiogram?",
