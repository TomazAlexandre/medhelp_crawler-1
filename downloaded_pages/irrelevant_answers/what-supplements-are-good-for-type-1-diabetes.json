            "answer": "Hello again,Over the years, I've read all sort of unusual stories about herbs and supplements having some amazing power to relieve Type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Each of those stories is quite scary to me because I'm certain that some folks actually *believe* them and may jeopardize their health & safety by using them.On the other hand, over the years my endocrinologist has discussed several supplements that medical research endorses as possibly helpful to stave off complications of our disease.\u00a0\u00a0Some supplements, however, cannot be taken -- and are quite *dangerous* if individuals take certain other medications or if they have specific conditions.Since so much information about supplements is provided by organizations who earn money by selling those supplements, it's hard to separate hype from fact.\u00a0\u00a0However, I have found an interesting research report by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)http://nccam.nih.gov/research/intramural/diabetes-unit.htmOn that website, you can read about current research as well as results.\u00a0\u00a0Once again, tho', do check in with your doctor and be very wary of any *amazing* health claims, especially with respect to Type 1 diabetes, which still has no known cures.This board is sponsored in part by JDRF, an organization whose sole mission is to fund the research that will eventually find the cures for diabetes and its complications.\u00a0\u00a0We're not there yet, tho'.Good luck and I hope you reach your doctor on Monday.",

            "answer": "Diabetics often are found to be low in certain minerals, magnesium being one. Also, some diabetics are deficient in B-12. Blood tests would show if you need supplements to bring minteral levels up to normal, though, so you may want to discuss supplements and any possible need for them with your doctor AFTER routine blood work is done to see what your levels are.",
