            "answer": "I think you better go to an internist or cardiologist. It's possible that you're having heart failure, fluid is getting backed up in your lungs, and as a result you feel short of breath laying down.It's also possible there's something else like Pericarditis going on. I've just been diagnosed with that, and I also have some shortness of breath laying flat.Both of them come with other symptoms, usually, so it's worth checking them. Go see an MD, though.",

            "answer": "Shortness of breath (SOB) while laying flat can be a symptom of heart failure, however, in someone your age, that would be unlikely, possible, but unlikely. You say you are overweight, but you don't say, by how much. If you are obese, and lay flat, the weight of your body pressing on the lungs can also cause the same symptoms, including the cough. See a doctor and have this looked into.",
