            "answer": "Hello,I'm also a long-time diabetic and discovered the same thing for myself about 20 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0At taht time, I think there were some very expensive insurance available, but it wasn't worth it to me -- the premiums would've been so high, I could invest that money myself and grow my own coverage -- wihtout their commissions & fees.\u00a0\u00a0I have chosen to get the maximum that I can from my employer and to look into alternative investments that I view as insurance.Recently, my employer increased the maximum (some multiplier of our salary) that individuals could buy and, of course, I jumped at that chance.It would seem that over time, with Type 1s living long & healthy lives, that our \"actuarial risks\" would be adjusted downward.\u00a0\u00a0If we've lived with Type 1 for 20, 30, 50, that \"should\" count for something.Perhaps others will have suggestions.",

            "answer": "My husband and I were eventually able to find a company that would offer a small amount of life insurance for me. It is fairly expensive, though. I would suggest that you contact the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation at www.jdrf.org and ask this question. There is a staff member who specializes in questions such as this one who may be able to offer some information. Go to the Online Diabetes Support Team link and fill out the questionnaire... your request will be sent to the proper person. Good luck to you both.",
