    "question": "Here's a new one for me. My lump has been diagnosed as totally benign, and is labeled as \"Fibrous Mastopathy\". Apprently this occurs, not frequently, but not rarely in diabetic women. I found a great note - for any women interested, particularly fellow Type 1 Diabetics - google \"fibrous mastopathy diabetic\" and choose the one labeled \"One lump\u00a0\u00a0or two\".I was told this is quite possible to happen again in my lifetime, with all of the attendant testing required.Too much fun! But my answer finally came and was as good as I could have hoped for.Thank you ladies for your wonderful support during this very stressful couple of months!Keep in touch!Susan",
