It cn also be a start of peripheral neuropathy, which is caused by diabetes mellitus, Vitamin B deficiencies, specially B12, Hypothyroidism, alcoholism, diseases like Guillian Barre syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, kidney and liver diseases.If it is not too problematic, it can be ignored. Else, please consult your GP for evaluation.Do keep me posted.Regards",

            "answer": "mini_d has come up with the right possibilities, however \"it can be ignored\" is absolutely positively the wrong advice.You have a flag for diabetes, and the first thing you should do it head for the drug store and purchase a blood sugar meter.
