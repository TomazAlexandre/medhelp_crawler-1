            "answer": "I would suggest you see your physician to have any serious reasons ruled out. It could be a high thyroid or diabetes, but then again, it could be more serious, please get checked, loosing that much weight in that lenght of time is not too good. I read that if you loose more than 10% of your weight in 6 months, you should have it looked in to.",

    "question": "I started to lose weight about 15 months ago, ten lbs over six months then another 10 lbs since. I have recently regained about 5 lbs. I have always weighed about 160 lbs on a thin 6 ft frame.I am now about 145 lbs.We eat well, lots of fruit and veggies, chicken & pork little beef, fish as much as possible.The only change I can think of is a hard fall I took in the winter of 2010 and bashed my skull pretty hard.I expect I had a concussion I have first responder experience. Thyroid problems are not unknown in my family!Any idea what could be causing this?",
