            "answer": "Hello,Thanks for writing in this forum.Numbness and falling asleep are abnormal sensations that can occur anywhere in your body, but are often felt in your hands, feet, arms, or legs. Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol?Such symptoms are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms are gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Common disorders causing such symptoms are transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.Treatment will depend on the diagnosis.Hope this information helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",

            "answer": "It could be a B12 deficiency, because I don't think I always eat properly, and I seem more prone to weakness and other things during my period.I don't drink regularly, and haven't had one drink in 6 months. Also, I don't have anything like diabetes to my knowledge, and my blood pressure was taken only a couple weeks ago or so. I'll try and get an appointment to see about this, but it might be a while between my mum's doctor's appointments and my other activities.The numbness is rather bothersome though. It's not a huge amount of numbness, just like I feel less in the areas that I think should have more feeling. Especially limbs and my head.",

    "question": "Recently, I asked my doctor about a circulation/numbness problem I've had lately. There are times where I will wake up suddenly in the night and not be able to feel certain body parts. Such as my arms (sometimes both at the same time) or leg/foot. I probably wouldn't think as much of this if it wasn't for the fact that I'm not in a position that they should be falling asleep. He figured it was a position thing, but I'm not sure.Along with that, I currently have numbness throughout my body, things falling asleep easily, weakness, and light-headednes. Also a strange feeling in my chest.I'm not on any medication that should be causing such things.",
