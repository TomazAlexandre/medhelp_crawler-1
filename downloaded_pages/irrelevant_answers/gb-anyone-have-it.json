            "answer": "I'm in a similar situation. Wss tested early because of family history and have to do a night time insulin shot. I was so scared at first but i hardly even feel it and it works amazingly! I am 21 weeks now and my numbers have stayed great. There is a lot of extra testing i have to do, like a fetal echo and stress tests further in, but my insurance is good so i don't mind the extras to make sure baby is healty :) My doc also said that as long as sugars stay controlled, there is no additional risk of birth complications, which is a huge relief!",
