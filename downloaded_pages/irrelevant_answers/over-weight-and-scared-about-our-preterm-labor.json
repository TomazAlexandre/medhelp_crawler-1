            "answer": "That is an easy way to psyche yourself out! HahaWhile i am overweight myself, i\u00a0\u00a0had complications in the beginning of my pregnancy. Nothing horrible just a SCH (subchorionic hematoma) which is where there was a clot that got forced out and i blef a lot. Scary! As i was told again and again that i had nothing to worry about, preterm delivery had been a fear of mine.My only advice to you is to familierize yourself with the symptoms of preterm labor. It put my mind at ease to know what to do \"just in case\"I also realized its better to accept the possibility and overcome it. Stressing/worrying about a situation isnt going to make it go away.Good luck (:And i can safely say, being \"obese\" i didnt go into preterm labor. My due date is in 8 days (:",

            "answer": "I was a big girl with my 1st... 5ft 4in and 215 prepregnancy and 245 when I delivered... at 40 weeks exactly lol. I think that being overweight can lead to additional problems during pregnancy like being at higher risk for preeclamsia and gestational diabetes but if you dont have those issues you should be good.",

    "question": "I am over weight... Sigh.... But I've had an easy and uncomplicated pregnancy so far. I'm 30 weeks this weekend. I've read all kinds of articles about being over weight and how it can cause preterm labor. I haven't asked my midwife about it yet but plan to at my next appointment. Does anyone have experience with this? I'm not overly worried but it's still a concern. I want my baby to be fully cooked ;)",
