            "answer": "My husband has these same symptoms and also is diabetic. We live in Northern Utah and our temps now, the 10th of Nov. are in the upper 30's low 40's. My husband complains most of the year that he is hot and now he's finally feeling cool. He goes outside without a jacket and doesn't get cold. I think it's due to the diabetes. My husband's is stable with blood sugar levels between 130-140. That's the lowest we can bring it down on Metformin. I think anytime one has any health concern, that should see their doctor and not ignore things. Good luck.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Endocrine gland related conditions like hyperthyroidism, acromegaly and glucose control disorders (diabetes and hypoglycemia both) all result in increased sweating and heat in the body. Diabetes your husband has. Pheochromocytoma, cancers, carcinoid syndromes, tuberculosis and other infections too can cause increased sweating and heat. It can also be due to low blood pressure. Get his thyroid and adrenal gland function tested also. Avoid too much of tea, coffee, smoking and spicy food.\u00a0\u00a0Please discuss this with your husband\u2019s doctor and get yourself investigated accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0Take care!",
