            "answer": "My first question to you is do you get the shakes no matter what food you eat? 2) Or, the shakes specific to certain types of foods?Here's what I would do if I were in your shoes; ask the doctor for a referral to an Endocrinologist (diabetes specialist). I also suggest you start monitoring and keeping a log of foods you consume. Log what you eat, how much you eat and how you feel directly after, 1 hour, 2 and 3 hours later. Do this for every meal, including snacks. Present this log to the endo. One thing I'd question the endo on is your pancreas, if it's producing too much insulin when stimulated by certain foods, thus causing a large drop in blood glucose levels.Good luck and I hope he/she uncovers and resolves your shaking problem.",

    "question": "I am a 33 year old woman, mother of 4 and in good health. Not obese, about 5' 7\" and around 150 lbs. For the past few years, I get really shaky and weak and my heart pounds right after I eat. It lasts a good hour and then I feel better. I told my doctor and she did a fasting blood sugar on me and it came back fine. But I feel fine if I don't eat. However, I have to force myself to eat because the longer I go without eating, the worse I feel after I finally do. I don't have other typical diabetes symptoms. What could this be?",
