            "answer": "Thanks for your response, however I am very concerned, as I told you before that 5 to 6 weeks after the encounter, I started feeling seek, low grade fever atleast once in a week, thereby I did a medical checkup, only to fin out that suddenly I was diagnosed by Diabetes type 2, and hypothyroid. After a week of this I developed phenmonia with high fever and lasted for more than 10 days. Now I am fine, recovered from phemonia.But my concern is since my recovery I feel hot face and hot plams. The cough doesn't seems to go even though it is not sever, but it persists.Can you please advice on why I am feeling hot chills on my face and hands and some times I feel cold whne sit directly in front of AC.I feeling of sickness doesn't seems to go, is it because I am taking so many medicines for thyroid, Diabetes, Hypertension, high Uric acid and high cholesterol.Some of the material on internet suggets that, when suffering from HIV you feel hot cheeks and face along with feeling of fever, very low grade.My sincere apologies if I have posted irrelevent question in this forum, however your advice would do a lot good to me. Do you still thinnk I am not suffering from HIV,",
