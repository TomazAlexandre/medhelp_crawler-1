    "question": "Hello.Just a question, what can I feed my diabetic min-pin that is home cooked? She will not eat any kind of dog food, this is how she got the pancreatitis that caused the diabetes.My vet is of no help, she said that if she won't eat the RX dog foods then just give her white meat chicken, boiled only and brocolli or green beans. That's it and I know that my dog is not getting enough nutrients from this diet. She was diagnosed in May of 2006 at the age of 5. She gets 3 units of HUMULIN N twice a day. Her last Frutosomine test was on the high side, \"490\" but her vet said that there is no need for concern.Please help me with some diet ideas. As it stands now her vet has given me these guild lines:FAT= 9 grams or less per mealProtein= 22+ grams per mealCarbs= little or NO carbs at all, vet said there are no good carbs for any living thing, animal or man.No fiber, no dairy nothing but chicken and green beans or broccoli. Ugh!!!Thank you,Robby",
