            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Symptoms of heart failure are breathlessness aggravated by exertion and dependant edema. The light headedness may happen if there is inadequate supply of oxygen to the brain. This can happen with cardiac disorders or lung disorders.\u00a0\u00a0In cardiac disorders there is inadequate pumping\u00a0\u00a0of blood and in lung disorders there is inadequate oxygenation. It could also be due peripheral arterial blood disorders. Symptoms are usually aggravated with exercise in cardiac disorders. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension can cause these symptoms. Again inadequate sleep, hypoglycemia, anemia and vitamin deficiencies can aggravate your symptoms of lightheadedness.\u00a0\u00a0You will need to consult your primary care physician for a proper evaluation.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your comment. Sorry it took so long for me to log back on and read you comment and reply back to you as I have been having testing by a cardiologist. Stated EKGs, Blood Tests, X-rays all looked ok, and Treadmill Stess Test said was ok. But I had noticed lately my heart rate would go to 50 when I was very relaxed, another doctor I saw for that monitored me for an hour and my heart rate droped to 50 a few times while resting on the exam bed reclined. I told him that my usual heart rate at rest was 72-68 and just now started to be 50 when relaxed.That paticular doctor kinda laughed at me and said the 50 heart rate was nothing and that the EKG he ran show I was ok.\u00a0\u00a0I do feel lightheaded still and do not seem to get and answer as to the cause. I am 58 years old and been sedentary for a few years due to helping watch my father who has alzheimer's. I feel I was left with no real explaination for my low heart rate.",

    "question": "When I lay on stomach my chest feels full and ache and seems hard to get a deep breath. I have not had much sleep in over a week and having anxiety and also feeling lightheaded most of the time. Also having dull pain in solar plexus that a dotor thought was a pulled muscle from strained coughing due to post nasal drip from allergy. Could this be heart failure?",
