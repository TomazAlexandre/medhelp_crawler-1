            "answer": "Hey Barbara!Well, since both the mother and the grandmother got the disease beyond 65 years of age, these are likely to be sporadic cases (with little genetics involved), as is seen in a majority of cases with the disease. It\u2019s only minority of cases (less than 1%) that are believed to be genetically linked. These usually present before 65 years of age. Environmental more than the genetic factors are believed to have a major role in the development of the disease.Though none of these have been proved yet, factors that may be involved in an early development of disease are hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, excessive exposure to environmental pollution, electromagnetic waves etc. Adequate control of the factors may play a role in preventing or in delaying the onset of the disease.Other factors that may be beneficial in preventing or delaying the onset of the disease include are a higher level of education, keeping the brain regularly involved, such as in activities like reading, solving puzzles, calculation, music, art etc., dietary aspects like following a \u2018mediterranean diet\u2019 (red wine, with plenty of fruits and vegetables), the Indian spice \u2018turmeric\u2019 etc. Low dose aspirin/ NSAIDS and medical marijuana may also be effective in the process.Hope this information helps.Take care!",
