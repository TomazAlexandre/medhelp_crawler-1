            "answer": "Hi there!Yes, diabetes has been linked to both coeliac diasese and carpal tunnel; though carpal tunnel is more common with type 2 diabetes. However, this does not necessarily mean that the symptoms you experience are definitely due to carpal tunnel, and other possibilities like infections/ inflammations, degenerations, neuro-muscular issues, vascular cases, bone/joint causes, micronutrient deficiencies etc may need to be considered as well. It is not necessary for neuropathy to affect all nerves in the body at the same time and the possibility may need to be considered as well. I would suggest getting this evaluated by a primary care physician initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

            "answer": "HiI had two disc's go in my neck also had carpal tunnel all happen within 24hrs. two weeks later I swelled up really bad. My edema was everywhere and all my joints were very painful. Doctors thought I was allergic to the NASIDS, so I stopped taking them, the swelling edema did not go. MRI for neck showed that the capal tunnel was not caused by my two bulgying discs. My doctor thought I had a heart condition done bloods, urine test and xray and stress test. Nothing showed up except vitamin d low. I thought I had RA so i did a RA diet cut out gluten and diary. after two days I could walk with out pain, RA tests came back negative. I had celiacs! also a dairy intolerence. 70% of my edema went and I started to be able to make a fist again. I searched the net for answers, and found that due to my celiacs I had omega 3, copper, vitamin d, folic acid, b12 , B1, and once this was fixed up my edema and carpal tunnel went away within a month.\u00a0\u00a0Give it a try what have you got to lose.",
