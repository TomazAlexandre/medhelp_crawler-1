            "answer": "They won't generally induce someone at 37 weeks, unless there is a serious medical indication.\u00a0\u00a0You can ask, but he probably won't do it.\u00a0\u00a0The reason is that while of course, most 37 weekers do just fine, there are a portion who have more problems than infants born at or after 38 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0They can often feed poorly, have problems with temp regulation, and blood sugar issues.Most hospitals have policies that won't even allow an elective induction prior to 38 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0The earlier an induction is done, the higher the incidence of needing a C/S, too.\u00a0\u00a0The cervix is a complex thing, and it relies on a variety of signals sent by the body in the last 2 weeks of pregnancy to soften and \"ripen\" for labor.\u00a0\u00a0Early inductions do not allow enough time for this critical step.",

            "answer": "My doctors are giving me a c-section at 37wks provided a good amnio the day before and I have a SERIOUS medical condition and have battled in and out of hospitals this whole pregnancy. They don't like to do it early. It can provide many complications. They won't do it electively like peek and deanne said. It is about benefits outweighing risks.",

            "answer": "hey...Like you, I also have gestational diabetes and have had a hard pregnancy..... Ill be 37 weeks Thursday, so next monday I will only be 37 weeks 4 days which is when he will probably want to take him...... I guess we can wait..... I just want my hubby to be able to spend more time with us.... also... a question for you....... I know that if my sugar levels are not controlled well it will cause an effect on the baby such as him elevating his sugar lavels... but what does this mean ultimately for him?????? I think my sugar levels are pretty well under control but y'know how us mommy's worry :)",

            "answer": "Well I also have a rare life threatening condition to add on top of all that crazy stuff too. i can't wait either even though I'm nervous.As far as the baby goes if your levels are not well controlled then his sugar could plummet severely when he's born which is dangerous of course. But the doctors usually can get that under control. It's just scary. They have done studies that say if the mother's GD wasn't under control then there is a chance the baby could develop juvenile diabetes later on. Not necessarily will happen, but could. My sugar levels are insane and no one can figure then out so I just hope my DD will be ok. So your original due date is Oct 4th? I'll be 37wks Thursday too. How cool is that.....",
