            "answer": "hi to everyone, I too know the pain of neuropathy although I don't have diabetes. mine is due to a nerve impingement in my spine...DDD and osteoarthritis.I understand the deep pain, mine doesn't burn, its more of a deep achy shooting pain of the nerves.Its very hard to medicate for this.I am on high doses of gabapentin(neurontin)...that does help immensely, before starting on that a few years ago I was in agony, but I know that it doesn't work for everyone, and some have many side effects also, I'm lucky that I don't.have you tried this medication? or other anticonvulsants?",

            "answer": "hi and welcome old friend!! nice to hear from you again, many of us here have similar pain caused by neuropathy, usually its caused by diabetes but as I 've said I do not have diabetes and neither do you.I've been told mine is more than likely due to the nerve impingement in my lower back...this can cause alot of pain in the lower limbs and also neuropathy....my one leg is much worse than the other and on this side I too have pain down into my foot...the foot will burn but not the leg/legs....with the legs its more of a tightness/muscle spasm feeling and the non stop ache...(hey I too need SPELL CHECK, you are NOT alone here either!)I have discribed my leg pain as they feel like they are encased in cement...maybe more accurate is they feel like they are CEMENT...heavy,hard to bend, and SOLID...Like I said to Jude there arn't many medications to help this, other than anticonvulsants, have you tried any of these? ask your doctor about them.I started out 6 yrs ago on a moderate dose but now I am at the top of the prescription. so the body does build up a tolerance.they are still helping some, I no longer have the shock, shooting pain.just the numbness and ache..You are dealing with many health issues Dabubaba, deafness is such a frustrating and lonely feeling, my mom was quite deaf by the age of 70 and I fear I will be the same as I feel already I am missing many words.take care my friend, I hope we get more people to tell us their successeshave a good day",
