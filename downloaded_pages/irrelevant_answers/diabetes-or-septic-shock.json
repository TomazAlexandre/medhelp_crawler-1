    "question": "My 42 year old brother-in-law died Thursday morning around 5:00 a.m. He was admitted to Medical Center East Wednesday morning after his wife couldn't wake him. His blood sugar was over 600 and we assumed he had gone into a diabetic coma even though he had never been diagnosed as being diabetic. His blood pressure was extremely low and his heart rate over 100, at one point around 170. He saw his physician the previous Monday after a bout with nausea and was given a steroid shot because the doctor believed he had a stomach flu. The next day, he almost passed out and the paramedics were called. They checked his vital signs and said he was OK. The next day he was in the hospital fighting for his life. As I said, we all assumed he was diabetic, but after a CAT scan, it was discovered his pancreas was damaged. My question is did my brother-in-law die from diabetes or septic shock? Did his physician and/or the paramedics, screw up and miss what was happening? Is there anything that could have been done differently, within reason, that could have saved his life?",
