            "answer": "Maybe this is or isn't related to the original surgery. Have you had any recent injuries? You should get checked for what could be going on here. Have you had any vascular problems, diabetes or nerve damage? Your family doctor or internist might be a good place to start. The burning concerns me. Is there swelling. Write down all the things that are going on, and go to someone who deals with orthopedic medicine. There are disorders that can result years later from injuries and surgery, but you should keep a close eye and make sure if there is redness or swelling or both that you get into the doctor. Please take care. Hope you feel better soon.",
