All throughout the first three preg. all they could see was the gestational sac and nothing inside of it at 6 and 7 weeks I have been scared to death for the past week about this pregnancy, but today i went for my first us and when they started to do it I started to cry I was terrified to know what I was going to see or not going to see. But too mine and my husbands suprise there was a yolk sac and it had a heart beat. I know what you are goign through right now being scared to death. But think positive that's all you can do in these situations is think positive.\u00a0\u00a0I'm still terrified because my last lpm was may 23 and my us only measured at 5 weeks 6 days and I should be close to 8 weeks. So I haver to get another u/s on next monday. I will be praying for you but please keep your head high. Love Angel",
