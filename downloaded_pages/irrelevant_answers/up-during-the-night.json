            "answer": "Hi,How old are you?Snoring is the sound caused by air as it passes through the narrowed passages of the airways during sleep. Men's air passages are narrower than women's.Obesity may also modulate snoring due the fat that embraces the neck which may also narrow air passages.Smoking,sedatives and excessive alcohol drinking may also cause snoring.Allergies and sinus problems which may narrow the air passages and certain lying positions may als cause snoring.Snoring is not a cause of worry unless it awakens you at night to cach your breath or becomes annoying enough for your partner. Is this happening to you? A condition called sleep apnea may be the cause of your snoring.This warrants further investigation by a sleep specialist ( pulmonologist who specializes in sleep disorders) and ENT specialist.Sleep apnea is real obstruction of the airways.Do you have any associated problems such as diabetes or cardiovascular problems. Your primary physcian may be able to help you plan changes for our lfestyle.Losing weight, eating a well balanced meal, smoking cessation may help you alleviate your problem.Try not to use a pillow or adjust your pillows in such that your head is elevated about 4 inches.This brings your tongue and jaw forward. Just be careful not to over extend the neck since this may cause you neck pains.I hope this helps.All the best!",

            "answer": "Hello I just turned 34 years old. My wife says it sounds as if I stop breathing and then all of a sudden try to get my breath. I have no known problems at this time, I don't drink but on ocassion, no smoking at all. I started a job about 2 years ago that has almost no movement(deskjob). Compared to before I was always on the move and doing something with my body, Ive become alot more lethargic in the past two years.I asked my wife last night if she thought Id started snoring more as my weight has increased and she says yes. But the one thing the really bugs me is my mouth just relaxes too much when I sleep and it opens and I end up with dry mouth, I have to keep a glass of water next to my bed whereas I never used to.",

            "answer": "Hi,I understand the discomfort of having a dry mouth due to the snoring .Our muscles relax during sleep and that includes muscles of the jaw.You may want to elevate your head by stacking some pillows to support your back.This will bring your jaw and tongue forward . Be careful not to take in water while lying down. Sit up and drink slowly to avoid aspiration.The main problem here actually is your catching your breath at night during sleep.You may be suffering from sleep apnea which warrants further evaluation from a sleep specialist since sleep apnea is associated with airway obstruction.You may als want to consult with an ENT specialist for evaluation of your neck and throat.Keep a good exercise regimen most days of the week to keep your weight down. I think this is something that you have to seriously\u00a0\u00a0look into .Keep us posted and hoping to hear regarding your progress.",
