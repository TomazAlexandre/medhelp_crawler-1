He did not have any dose redctions at all.\u00a0\u00a0He is geno 1 stage 4.His first treatment was with soc for 48 weeks the second with soc for 72 weeks and the last with Inc.\u00a0\u00a0I was just wondering if perhaps weight had anything to do with it.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for responding.",

            "answer": "Hi CLJ and welcome!!In general obesity creates a large strain on the liver - even in an otherwise healthy person.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think that any liver specialist/doctor would tell you otherwise.\u00a0\u00a0It's widely reported that obesity CAN contribute to, or exacerbate, most any form of liver disease.\u00a0\u00a0And in general, better overall health predicts at least slightly improved odds for treatment success.\u00a0\u00a0So from these points we can reasonably conclude that obesity is certainly not helping his case.\u00a0\u00a0However beyond that, I don't know the answer to your question.\u00a0\u00a0 Hopefully someone with more knowledge and experience will be along soon - and can provide you w/a more conclusive reply.",

            "answer": "I found a few articles that I had bookmarked. Some of them mention BMI as a factor (in addition to many other factors) that can affect SVR. Some of these factors are not as relevant as they were prior to the use of Protease Inhibitors, but many of them are still relevant. You said he is very overweight. Often people who are overweight are also Insulin Resistant and/or have Type II Diabetes, both of which may have some bearing on SVR. However, Cirrhosis is a major factor is lower SVR rates.From Medscape:Factors associated with response to peginterferon and direct antiviral agent-based therapy.Viral factors*Genotype*Genotype 1 subtypes (only with PIs)*Baseline HCV RNA levels (>400,000\u2013800,000 IU/ml)*Specific viral mutationsHost factorsFixed*Age*Sex*Race*Fibrosis*IL28B genotype*Gene expression profile (ISG preactivation)*IP-10 titer*ITPA genotype*Previous response to pegIFN/RBV (only in nonresponders)Potentially modifiable*BMI*Insulin resistance*Adherence*Coffee consumption*Vitamin D statusFrom \"In Practice\"Pretreatment Predictors of ResponseA number of factors associated with response to interferon-based therapy have been identified (Table 17). Although data are limited, because of the importance of the interferon response, most of the same factors likely affect response to direct-acting antiviral agents to some degree. Viral factors are limited to viral genotype, hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA titer, and possibly mutations in certain regions of the viral genome. Viral subtype is relevant because differing rates of resistance to protease inhibitors (PI) have been noted in patients with genotypes 1a and 1b.[Sarrazin 2010] In addition, several host factors are associated with response, some of which are fixed while others may be modifiable.Viral FactorsGenotype 1 or 4Genotype 1a (only with PIs)High HCV RNA titer (> 600,000 IU/mL)Specific viral mutationsGenotype 1a has a lower barrier to resistance to protease inhibitors, and therefore emergence of resistance is more frequent with this viral subtype than with genotype 1b.Host FactorsFixed:Older ageMale sexRace (black > white > Asian)Advanced fibrosis/cirrhosisIL28B genotype (non-CC)Gene expression profile (ISG preactivation)IP-10 titerITPA genotypePotentially Modifiable:High BMIInsulin resistanceHIVCoffee consumptionVitamin D statusFibrosisMore advanced fibrosis and particularly the presence of cirrhosis is a strong negative predictor of treatment outcome in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The reason why cirrhosis is associated with interferon nonresponse is unknown but is likely to be multifactorial. Unfortunately, the presence of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis is also associated with reduced sustained virologic response (SVR) rates with protease inhibitor (PI)\u2013based regimens, likely due to reduced interferon responsiveness in treated patients.Body Mass Index/Insulin ResistanceIncreased body mass index, particularly if associated with hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance, is a strong negative predictor of treatment response to peginterferon/ribavirin-based therapy.[Eslam 2011] Increased doses of interferon and ribavirin may partially overcome the effects of increased body weight, but responses in obese and diabetic patients are poor.[Fried 2008] Encouraging overweight patients to lose weight, ideally at least 10% of their body weight, through diet and exercise may significantly improve treatment outcomes, although this can be difficult to achieve in practice.[Pattullo 2010]Insulin resistance even in the absence of diabetes or obesity is strongly associated with treatment outcome with peginterferon/ribavirin therapy; indeed, the effect of significant insulin resistance on treatment outcome is similar to that of viral genotype. Unfortunately, initial trials of insulin-sensitizing agents such as metformin and pioglitazone have not shown significant improvements in HCV treatment outcome in patients receiving peginterferon/ribavirin.[Romero-G\u00f3mez 2009; Harrison 2012] Weight loss can improve insulin sensitivity and therefore should be encouraged in overweight patients before starting therapy.Here is a link to an excellent presentation by Dr. Jean-Michel Pawlotsky. It covers resistance issues and why people fail treatment.http://74.43.177.57/courses/2010/pg/pawlotsky/player.html",

            "answer": "Hopefully his liver is still compensated and he will be able to try the new treatment (sofosbuvir, ribavirin, and interferon) that will be available soon (maybe December of this year or early next year) if approved.\u00a0\u00a0If his liver decompensates, and if his BMI remains high, it will be impossible for him to receive a liver transplant if one is ever needed.\u00a0\u00a0One of the criteria for being listed is a specific BMI (I can't remember exactly what it is).\u00a0\u00a0This is because an obese person is less likely to survive a transplant and the post transplant period, so it is something for him to know and keep in mind.As others have said, obesity leads to fatty liver, which puts an additional strain on the liver and may cause his cirrhosis to progress more quickly.Advocate1955",
