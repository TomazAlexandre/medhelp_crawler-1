            "answer": "Doubt this is T2DM.\u00a0\u00a0The dose fluctuation in levoxyl may be the cause -- dropping from 125 to 88 -- check with your doctor to make sure they were not thinking you were still on 100mcg when they suggested to decrease to 88....Sweating after a meal is not a typical thyroid related problem but may be related to the dose change.\u00a0\u00a0Sweating is usually controlled by the involuntary nervous system, so there may be over-excitement of this system mis-triggered by food intake -- not sure why that would happen.\u00a0\u00a0Would consider looking at all other meds/supplements/etc with your doctor to see if anything else may be a cause.",

    "question": "I have had trouble getting my levoxyl right, I originally was diagnosed as hypothyroid in dec 2007, but after various doses of levoxyl, started with 100 mcg, went up to 125 mcg, then my tsh was .001 and was now hyperthyroid, doctor lowered to 88 mcg, and i have been on that dose for a few weeks, I am having a wierd reaction that whenever I eat anything, or drink a cup of coffee, my whole body breaks out in a sweat, soaking wet to the point I have to shower, 3-4 times a day.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone had a reaction like this?\u00a0\u00a0I am so confused, some are saying I could be type 2 diabetic, can you be hypothyroid and type 2 at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0They say the excessive sweating after eating is a symptom of type 2 diabetes.....any help would be appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0I am so sad and depressed about this, I hate to even go on a date with my boyfriend and eat anything, cause I am so embarassed.",
