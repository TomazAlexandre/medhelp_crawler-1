            "answer": "There is no doctor on this board, just other diabetics. You don't say if you are diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, but yes, you most certainly should continue monitoring your glucose levels at home. It doesn't make any difference how much blood you get on the strip, as long as you get enough for a reading. Home meters are said to have a 20% variation in accuracy. The more expensive one (with more expensive test strips) are more accurate. I use an Acucheck Aviva and it seems very accurate.",

You said home meters are said to havea 20% variantion in accuracy. does it mean the meter shows 20% less\u00a0\u00a0or 20% more in the value when compared to lab result? idnt understand. kindly enlighten on the issue.I f the Fasting sample gives a result of 112 , does it mean the lab test result will be more than this or less than this.",

            "answer": "The variation could be in either direction. I have heard the Ultra One Touch is one of the better ones. My suggestion is to just trust the meter and use it for useful information about whether your blood sugar goes up or down.",

    "question": "Dear doctor,How far the so called blood glucose monitoring meters are reliable for the diabetic patients. I know that the laboratory test where the plasma blood is drawn is very reliable when compared to glucometer\u00a0\u00a0tests, since the whole blood is drawn in this. I am told by one physician who himself said to be a diabetologist, said that\u00a0\u00a0more the blood you draw on to the test strip, the glucometer record higher levels and when the less quantity of blood is drawn on to the test strip, the glucometer records lower\u00a0\u00a0levels and gives a distorted picture of the glucose levels. Isit so? Or does that physician is under the wrong impression about the glucometers?Kindly enlighten on this subject, since iam more confused with the physicians statement and iam in a dialemma whether i should continue monitoring my glucose levels from time to time apart from the laboratory tests\u00a0\u00a0done periodically.",
