            "answer": "Hi Mayceee,If you are diagnosed i the first trimester (I was with my first, in fact my endo tested as soon as I got pregnant and i failed the glucose tolerance test), then it is not gestational diabetes, but rather preexisting diabetes that is uncovered by the pregnancy.I was very athletic prepregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I had been tested for diabetes early and come back negative.\u00a0\u00a0But I was on insulin by the time I was 3 months pregnant.Please ask any questions you want and I will do my best to answer.Control your sugar well with insulin, diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0You and your baby will be fine.\u00a0\u00a0I now have 2 beautiful girls after 2 diabetic pregnancies.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your reply. I asked my endo regarding pre existing diabetes but I was told that I do not meet criteria for overt diabetes and therefore still fall under gestational. Either way, watching my diet carefully, trying to get exercise.Thanks!!!",

            "answer": "Hi Maycee,the fact that it has developed so early will mean that you need to check carefully after pregnancy.In my case, I was on insulin by the time i was 3 months pregnant (insulin was such a relief as it allowed me to control my blood sugars well).\u00a0\u00a0I continued with insulin after the pregnancy (much lower dose) through a second pregnancy up to now (7 years later).\u00a0\u00a0I still have very good control and don't have to use too much insulin.",

            "answer": "Hi,Congratulations on your pregnancy.6.1 (110) fasting is too high.\u00a0\u00a0You want it to be less than 5.2 (95).Please check your post-eating, you want it to ideally be less than 6.6 (120).You need to see your doctor already and as soon as possible, to get started on medication (most likely insulin).\u00a0\u00a0Insulin resistance will increase throughout the pregnancy and it is very important to have excellent control from the beginning - as high blood sugars at this point can affect the development of your baby's organs.You can use up the existing strips, it should be accurate enough for now.\u00a0\u00a0You will need to get new ones soon enough.\u00a0\u00a0Adopt a low carb diet (no sweets etc), but get plenty of veges, protein and healthy fats.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise daily.\u00a0\u00a0these will all help, but given your current numbers will not be enough.",
