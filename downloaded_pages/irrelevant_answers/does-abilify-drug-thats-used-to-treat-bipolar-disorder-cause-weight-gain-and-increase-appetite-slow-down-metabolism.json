            "answer": "What you are noticing is a standard side effect of atypical antipsychotics which are metabolic changes leading to weight gain. That will happen with all of them although Abilify is the least likely but its still common. There's a new one about to hit the market but I believe its has the same side effect profile but we'll see when it comes out. Its important to see a nutritionist because the weight gain if unchecked can lead to diabetes so you'll have to modify your diet for sugar intake and the like but a nutritionist could give more specific advice. Its important that you ask your psychiatrist what were the reasons he put you on Abilify. If you have bipolar with psychotic features then you absolutely need an antipsychotic but if you have straight bipolar then there are a wider option of mood stabilizers. Antipsychotics are used as mood stabilizers too but if a person does not have any form of psychosis the standard mood stabilizers such as Lithium, Lamictal or Depakoate can be tried and two of those are likely to cause weight gain but Lamictal is not.But if you discuss it with him and he states specifically why you need an antipsychotic then a reccomendation to a nutritionist might be a good idea. You can also keep of new antipsychotics as they come out by googling \"psychmeds123\" and hopefully newer ones will have a better side effect profile as regards weight gain. Fortunately, in the coming years there will be a new generation of antipsychotics, the glutamate antagonists that do not cause weight gain, diabetes or tardive dyskinesia and promote a fuller recovery. I am on glycine, a Phase II antipsychotic in FDA study and have made a full recovery from schizoaffective disorder. My psychopharmocologist will be publishing the results and I will make them available but in the meantime you can find the official study by googling \"Dr. Javitt, glycine\".",

            "answer": "Abilify as I said is the least likely of the new antipsychotics to cause weight gain but it can happen. It happens to a reasonable percentage of people but less than than the other atypicals because its a SDA (Serontonin Dopamine agonist) and works in a somewhat different manner than Risperdal, Zyprexa and Olanzapine which often cause weight gain (Geodon less but its the same class as those). So Abilify is a slight update and the side effect of weight gain is less common. But it can happen which unlike tardive dyskinesia which is a risk that increases at the rate of \"2.5 percent per person per year\" (and should be monitored for by people's psychiatrists at regular intervals with a movement disorders test) to quote my psychopharmocologist with all atypical antipsychotics, weight gain and diabetes thankfully are not something that will happen over time and are less common with Abilify but are still within a reasonable realm of proabability. If people want more specifics look up the medication online (on a medically reliable site, the medications themselves usually have websites of their own as well) or the package insert and read more there.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the posts.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, I do understand that the abilify is the least likely out of the antipsychotics to cause weight gain but in my case, I think it is slowing down my metabolism.\u00a0\u00a0I have never been fat, but the weight that I\u00a0\u00a0gained within a month is substantial.\u00a0\u00a0However, I do not know for sure that it is the abilify, but since it is an antipsychotic drug, then the nature of the drugs has weight gain as a side effect.\u00a0\u00a0The probem is even if it is the culprit in the matter of my weight gain, people around me said that I seem more calm with it and not\u00a0\u00a0as nervous as I once was.\u00a0\u00a0So because it might be benefiting me a little, I would like to stick with the medicine as long as I can find something that will counteract the effect of the weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0Meaning, I would like to know of any safe medicines or supplements that can be used to keep the weight down.",

I can't post links to clinical research sites and even those clinicians won't know until the studies are complete. If you want to know more on a consumer based, provider monitored site that discusses treatments in general you might be interested in schizophrenia.com as they have some ongoing discussions there.
