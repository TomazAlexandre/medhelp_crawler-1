            "answer": "First of all, have you been tested to see if there's a chance you have sleep apnea?I went thru a period of drooling more than usual for a period of several months, even during the daytime. I think it was related to being on Prednisone, as when I went off it the drooling ceased. Ask your pharmacist if this could be a side effect of any meds you are on.",

            "answer": "HiSnoring is a symptom which may be either a simple snoring or snoring associated with sleep disorder. Obstructive sleep apnoea is an obstructive disorder characterized by repeated episodes of partial or complete cessation of breathing during sleep and excessive sleepiness during the day. These episodes may be classified as obstructive, central or mixed apnea.The upper airway resistance leads to snoring and resulting arousals during sleep. Use of sedative or alcohol and poor sleep hygiene also contribute to snoring. Patients predisposed to this disorder are generally overweight or obese and may have a short thick neck. Sleep apnea is associated with hypertension, diabetes and other cardiac abnormalities. Other conditions to rule out may be sleep deprivation, depression, narcolepsy, medications and hypothyroidism.I would advise you consult a sleep therapist for a complete evaluation. He may advise a sleep study (polysomnogram).Take care",

I've been doing a bit of research into it and I seem to have shown a couple of the symptons so i'm hoping i can kill a few birds with one stone.I wondered if it was anything to do with the anti-biotics I'm on or the fact that I have a weakend immune system that could be causing problems...Thanks.",
