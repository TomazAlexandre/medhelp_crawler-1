            "answer": "The biopsy shows a very low grade of fibrosis.\u00a0\u00a0I would agree that the liver would be an unlikely cause of your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0It is an encouraging sign that the liver function tests are within normal limits.\u00a0\u00a0If there is continuing concern about the liver, a hepatitis screen can be done.As for other tests to find a cause for the symptoms, you can consider an upper endoscopy or upper GI series to look for various causes of dyspepsia (i.e. GERD, inflammation of the upper digestive tract or an ulcer).Urinary frequency can be evaluated with blood tests for diabetes as well as sending the urine off for urinalysis and evaluation for infection.These options can be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

    "question": "Concerned about my liver, I don't beleive what my doctor istelling me. My biopsy said minimal fibrosis is seen witha grade of (0 1/4+). when I went to my doctor to get theresults he said that was good news as he put it, my livershould last over 50 years. I was a heavy drinker and healso said I must stop drinking which I have for 9 months.My LFT's have been normal for 6 months after they wereevevated. Asked him if i needed to change anything otherthan no drinking and he said no. I ask him about othersymptoms that I have (Growling in my stomach, urinate alot,dark yellow urination in the morning, dry mouth, loss ofweight, and I had a moderate amount of iron present. Hejust stated that its not my liver and I'll be fine. Doeshis evaluation of my liver should be good for 50 years soundright. I was suprised especially when I saw the word fibrosis.I know fibrosis can spread, but it also can stop its progress.My doctor also said he quaranteed me my liver would be goodfor 50 years. Not may doctors will say that. I'll get anotheropion, it just seems doctors want to get you in and outof their office a quickly as possible. Should I worry aboutthe progression of fibrosis and how long does it take to progressif my doctor is wrong. Do you think my Doctor was correct thatmy liver should be fine for basically my life time.",
