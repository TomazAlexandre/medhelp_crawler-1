            "answer": "For starters, changing lifestyle habits can go a long way in controlling type 2 diabetes. In my eyes, it's a must do. If you decide not to change, diabetes becomes a progressive disease only getting worse over time ending with neurothapy and amptutation. You and only you can control and manage this disease. Here's how.Restrict & avoid eating foods with refined sugars, practice and adhere to weight control, do some sort of physical exercise daily, practice stress management, and get adequate sleep. These are all important in managing this illness, the most important, along with proper nutrition, is physical activity. Try to take 2000 steps daily if not at least 1000.Besides watching sugar in your diet-- you also need to watch carbohydrates [starches] carefully too. For example; things like white breads, potatoes, pasta, crackers, foods made with white flour, etc. can cause a drastic rise in your blood sugar if you aren't careful. [They are converted to sugar after you eat them]. Lower your intake of man-made or prepared foods.Other foods/drinks need care too. For example; processed milk has sugar, fruit & fruit juices [fructose aka fruit sugar] also can cause blood sugar to rise [so serving sizes and moderation are important]. With fruit it\u2019s important to eat them with other foods to slow the absorption of fructose. I'm NOT saying that these foods aren't allowed. What I AM saying is that you need to use care and follow the guidelines for diabetics \u2013 avoid sugar, avoid bad carbs, avoid sugary liquids, eat proper foods.If you can locate Splenda [succralose] in St Lucia use this as a sweetener instead of sugar. Go to the American Diabetes Association web site to educate yourself on diabetes. There is wealth of information to educate yourself about this disease.Lastly, didn't your doctor provide you with a home glucose test meter? You will need to test b4 each meal and 2-3 hours after each meal. This will tell you how the foods you consumed affected your glucose levels. Your target ranges are:prandial [b4 meals] 70-99 mg/dlpostprandial <141 mg/dl, optimum <121 mg/dlPost back to this thread if you have further questions.",

            "answer": "according to the theory of TCM, your kidney doesn\u2019t work/function properly, which causes the deficiency of Qi (vital energy), low immune system.So the most important thing for you to do is to improve the kidney function. As you know a strong and healthy kidney means a lot to those who have diabetes.I want to say, people should not be scared of diabetes but the complications such as hypertension, aches in the body and the decreased function of kidney. To treat and prevent the complications, according to our clinical practice and experience, it is important to make the pancreas work harder to produce natural insulin.",

            "answer": "As asok475 suggested a dietician is most helpful.Your question suggests you are not in contact with a physician who has set up a comprehensive instruction and monitoring plan. Such expertise is available at clinics that specialize in treating and evaluating diabetics. Among other things they will download readings from your glucose meter, as well as conduct periodic hba1c tests. While books and the internet are helpful, nothing beats an in-person question-and-answer period and regular meetings with a specialist who will review your blood sugar readings and suggest changes in medication of diet. There are excellent R.N.'s who specialize in this sort of thing.",
