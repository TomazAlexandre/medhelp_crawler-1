I mean this poor baby has to take a shot about 7 times a day and I feel like a whimp because of the hold Ultram has on me. She needs me now more than ever and I have to focus",

            "answer": "So good to hear from you - I have thought about you from time to time - and good for you that you are trying yet again. I certainly know how hard it is to get off those damn Ultram. I haven't even succeeded myself, because I had such a hard time for so long when I went c/t, so I stille take the occasional pill just to maintain a feeling of reasonable well-being, not to get high. So I know how hard it is. I have managed to cut back from 12 a day to 2 a day, not even that sometimes, so I am in control of the situation right now, but of course need to get off Ultram altogether.Maybe this is your time, hang in there, and I will definetely be here for you (even if I don't post much anymore, I still read).Take care.Minnie",
