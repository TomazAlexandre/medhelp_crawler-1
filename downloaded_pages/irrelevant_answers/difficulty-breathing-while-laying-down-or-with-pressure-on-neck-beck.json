            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Difficulty breathing with cough can occur with lower respiratory infections. This is more so if you are having fever. This can also occur due to other causes like Asthma, COPD or bronchitis. You will need to consult your doctor who may need to do a sputum culture and sensitivity to determine what antibiotic the organism is susceptible to. He may even ask for blood test and an X ray. Lung function tests could further help in evaluation. In the meantime try to take warm oral fluids and do steam inhalations prior to your meals. This helps to loosen up and bring out the secretions.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "Hi.. My name is Ryan, i'm 19 years old... and for the past month and a half, whenever i lie down, or press my back and neck against anything with a certain amount of pressure.. i get a shortness of breath and get a difficulty breathing. My stamina has also been a lot lower when it comes to doing physical activity.. and my heart beats gets really rapid during all of these things. I've also been waking up some days with a numbness in my foot + hand. And the other day i woke up and my pinky finger looked a little blue. I dont have a history of asthma or diabetes. Any ideas??",
