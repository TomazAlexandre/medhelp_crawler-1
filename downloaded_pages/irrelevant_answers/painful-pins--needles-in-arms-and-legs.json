            "answer": "From a different perspective, you might want to consider have your vitamin levels checked, if you're going to be having bloodwork done, anyway. Vitamin B12 deficiency, as well as calcium deficiency are both notorious for causing \"pins and needles\" feelings in the extremities--though mostly the arms and hands.As for \"RF liegioning\"...I'm not familiar with this, but I'm guessing RF stands for Radio Frequency? Is there a potential that this could have caused some nerve damage, which is now causing the pain you're feeling? I'm not sure what it's used for in the first place, but I can guess...I just don't like the results when I weigh the positives against the negatives of having this procedure done, in my head.Regardless, I hope you start to feel better soon!",

    "question": "I have arthritis in my lower spine and a bulging disc, I have had a nerve root injection, facet joint injections and RF liegioning (using a 10 mm electrode) this year, now I have painful pins and needles like symtoms which are worse at night as my back is painful to lie down sometimes. Any suggestions what is causing this?",
