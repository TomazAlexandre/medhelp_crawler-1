            "answer": "Hi.How would you describe the headaches that you experience? Do you have balance problems as well? Any hearing impairment? Do you have neck or back pains?Your symptoms are non-specific and a diagnosis cannot be ascertained at this time. A lot of conditions could possibly cause your symptoms, including diabetes, endocrine abnormalities, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, migraines, etc.If you feel that you are not being taken seriously by your current physician, you could opt to consult another one for a second impression.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Hi.Do the muscle aches occur all over or are they confined to some parts of your body?There are a lot of conditions aside from vitamin and mineral deficiencies which could cause generalized and specific muscle pain, including fibromyalgia, polymyalgia rheumatica, infections, some connective tissue disorders, etc.It would be advisable to also consult a rheumatologist and neurologist to determine or rule out any of these conditions.Good luck.",

    "question": "Hello,I'm a 23 year old female and hope to find some help or at least advice here.Back at the end of may/start of june i started experiencing all kinds of things.Twitches/stumic ache/very tired a lot/muscle ache/Botls of pain in my head....I went to my doctor and he adviced me to take magenesium wich I did. It got better for a little while and then it just came back. I went to the doctor again because I also had a bit of blurry vision and dizzyness. He forwarded me for an EMG.The EMG didn't show any problems and the doctor performing it decided I probebly have a cronic form of hyperventilation.Recently it's been getting wurse again. Specially dizzy and i've also a couple of times felt like there were minor electric shocks going trough my arms or legs or even a suddon shock in my head.Now i'm not sure what to do. It's very annoying to say the least. I don't really dare to go back to the doctor because he said thinking that it's not cronic form of hyperventilation basicly is a sign of having it. So i'm afraid I simply won't be taken seriously.I just want a way to get rid off this and feel completly fine!",
