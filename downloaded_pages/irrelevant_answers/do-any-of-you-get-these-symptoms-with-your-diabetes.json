            "answer": "I'm not sure why you think people on a Discussion Board would know what your Neurologist didn't but if you don't trust his diagnosis, you might want to seek another opinion. Perhaps there is another medication he can try you on that won't have bad side effects. Also the most important thing with Neuropathy is to control your blood sugar as tightly as possible.",

            "answer": "I am not sure that neuropathy starts off in the back, it is usually a limb thing first and can affect organs as well but usually after you have felt it in the feet and hands but then again everyone is different too. I would definately take a second opinion if you can cos to me it sounds like another nerve issue, like from a fall or back issue since you explain it as a spine thing basically. Neuropathy is usually nerve issues away from the spine and is known to start at the furthest of the linbs and can work inward, but again we all take it differently, hope you find an answer soon.",

    "question": "I have been having the following symptoms since March 2010. Heavy pressure in the middle of my back that goes up into my shoulder blades and into my neck, head and face. I get a tingling and burning sensation with it and my tongue will also go numb. I saw a Neurologist a couple months ago and he claimed it was all Neuropathy he put me on a medication that made me sick so I took myself off of it. I have only been a Type II diabetic since 2006. Do you think this is all diabetic related?",
