            "answer": "Hi Linda,I am 23 and also diagnosed with PCOS...I m also trying to conceive and am given drugs to get my O since it has been a factor... the chances of getting pregnant are there but you do need to get treated and try almost everything in order to become pregnant. I see my fertility Specialist who put me on Metformin (insulin resistance, I also have no idea what it is) to get my O this cycle. If not, then I will move to injectables to get my O...then IUI and IVF, if this won't help...I know nothing about tumor honestly....all I was told is that I have to watch my diet, excersice regularly in order to not become overweight..Im normal now but there is always a risk..same goes for sweets, I have to cut them in half and I absolutely LOVE THEM....Hope for the best and go to Fertility specialist if you want to become pregnant!Anya.",

    "question": "I am 23 yrs old, been diagnosed with PCOS, trying to conceive for almost a year. Doctor prescribed Dydrogesterone,10mg,to help me get and regularize my periods. Took the mention pill since May,07 to Oct. 07, i had to stop because i was having even more irregular periods, spotting.Now, today ( jan 30) went to doctor, the cysts on my ovaries are still the same ( normal sign of a patient with pcos ) but as ive been ttc for over a year, he suggested that i should take a blood test to see how levels of prolactin are. If it is too high, he said that there might be a tumor in the brain.I wanted to ask, and try to find out if you have been diagnosed with the same, or you know somebody. What are the chances of getting pregnant ? Does the tumor has to be removed? or you only take pills to get the prolac. level low? does it have any effect on the baby, or in the mother? is there any risks? Also, can anyone explain to me what insulin resistance means...? does it have to do with high levels of sugar ( diabetes) also?Thank you very much for your answers...Linda",
