            "answer": "I wouldnt \"assume\" you are diabetic already. This is easy to do thought if you are a sufferer of anxiety.There are many more symptoms people with diabetes usually get besides sugar lows...I get sugar lows all the time... what happens to me is the opposite... not all the time... but time to time...I'll be getting hungry... and all of a sudden I feel light headed, dizzy, and sometimes sweaty... and I'll grab a soda and a candy bar... eat... relax... and I feel better!I asked about this... and lots of people have sugar lows without having diabetes...My buddy has diabetes and if he doesnt get his insulen.. he has convulsions etc.My grandpa has diabetes... and if he eats too much sugars he gets really bad headaches etc...And, to top it off... a lot of people who have diabetes have VERY VERY dry skin on the bottoms of their feet... VERY DRY...So, I'd say it's either just anxiety... or just a sugar low... and when you experience the sugar low you start to have a little anxiety b/c you don't feel right.I wouldnt worry... but if you want peace of mind... you could always see your Dr. =)I'm sure you are fine though. =)",
