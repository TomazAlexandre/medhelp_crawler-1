    "question": "I'd been having sex with a very promiscuous male since January 2009. Shortly after I developed bacterial vaginosis and a yeast infection.\u00a0\u00a0I was worried sick thinking I got an STD.\u00a0\u00a0I was testsed for syph and gonorreah and the results were negative.\u00a0\u00a0My yeast infection has persisted until now even after antibiotics and antifungal meds given to me in February.\u00a0\u00a0The antibiotics were only perscribed once but the vaginal antifungals 3 times in 10 months.\u00a0\u00a0The last time I had sex with this person was in mid to late September.\u00a0\u00a0I also got severe flu-like symptoms which accompanied my period in July, August, and September.\u00a0\u00a0I thought this could be early symptoms of HIV so I got tested on October 19th.\u00a0\u00a0The results came back negative but I know there is a three month window.\u00a0\u00a0Within the last month or so I've also developed thrush and swollen tonsils.\u00a0\u00a0EVERYTHING seems to be pointing in the direction of HIV and I'm having a nervous breakdown.\u00a0\u00a0We always used condoms but I'm afraid that I might've gotten HIV because mabye he had a laceration in his hand and he fingered me or somehow I got his excretions inside me.\u00a0\u00a0Once, he got soft while he was inside me and the condom stayed in when he pulled out..I don't know if any of the semen got on me or not.\u00a0\u00a0My question is, could I have HIV??\u00a0\u00a0I have chronic yeast infections of the vagina and now mouth and swollen tonsils.\u00a0\u00a0I tested again just Monday and I get the results back tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0I'm so afraid... I don't know if I can wait that long.\u00a0\u00a0Please help.",
