            "answer": "Yes it does sound like a stye. I had one when I was very young but had to have it surgically removed. It could be bad for your eye if it's under your eyelid and rubbing against it. I am uninsured so i understand the money part of it but I would get it checked out if you can't get it to go away soon. Better safe than sorry.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You should consult an eye specialist for this. It could be a stye. This could be due to diabetes, recurrent touching of eye, poor hygiene, immunoglobulin M (IgM) deficiency, dry eyes, and chronic infection of eyelids. Warm compress, topical antibiotics and good person hygiene usually does the trick. Get blood sugar tested.If it is on skin below the eye lid, then this can be a lipoma, a wart or cholesterol deposits and all these can be only removed surgically for cosmetic reasons only. Take care!",
