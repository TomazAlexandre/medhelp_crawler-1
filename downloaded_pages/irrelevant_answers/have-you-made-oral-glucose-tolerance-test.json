            "answer": "Good idea that you're having it done.....I have a strong family history of it and they had testing me immediately with blood work.......Under normal circumstances they wait until after 20 weeks b/c it's around that time that the baby's pancreas is formed, which is usually what causes Mom's sugar to be off.",

            "answer": "I think I had to eat jelly beans when I took mine with my first pregnancy. It isn't really harmful, but I think you can refuse it if you want. However, gestational diabetes could be very bad for you and baby. So, I would definitely take it.",

If my midwife noticed that I did have some sort of sign of it, then I would have it done. she basically gave me the option. I chose not to do it, also my mom said it made her very sick when she did.\u00a0\u00a0It's not something you have to, but most OB docs just recommend it.",
