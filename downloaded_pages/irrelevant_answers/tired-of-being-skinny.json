            "answer": "Just eating late at night isn't going to make you gain weight. You need to maintain a healthy diet all the time, or you could suffer adverse effects later on.I'm very sorry about your mother's passing; it's always hard to lose our mother, but when it's sudden and unexpected, even harder yet.If you lost the weight, due to stress over your mother's passing, you will need to deal with those effects first. You may need to try counseling or something to get past it.You can try to start eating very small meals, at frequent intervals to try to get back on a regular eating schedule.",
