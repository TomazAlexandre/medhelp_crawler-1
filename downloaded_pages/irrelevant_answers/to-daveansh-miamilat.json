It just seems unlikely to me that you would become infected from your exposure.As for me, yes, I tested NEG at 12 wks via OraQuick rapid test. Yesterday, 90 days after exposure, I went to my local health clinic for an STD check-up which also includes a standard ELISA HIV test. I will know my results in 2 wks, or maybe less if the results are ready.Hang in there!",
