    "question": "hi. i'm a 22 year old female who was recently diagnosed with PCOS. i've heard people with PCOS may be at risk for diabetes, and this may fit with my past and recent medical history. since i was about 13 i can recall about eight instances where i have come very close to passing out, and two where i have. the two where i actually have were supposedly the flu according to doctors... the others occurred in different situations but i usually guessed it had to do with not eating (although in one case i had just eaten a huge meal about 1/2 hr before it happened). what worries me is that the last two incidents have occurred within the past six months of each other, the closest i have ever experienced two very-near-fainting episodes (cold sweats, extreme dizziness and blurred vision all coming on very suddenly)... knowing what was happening each of these times i have been able to stop from fainting by sitting down and drinking water or soda, and cold air also helps. i am wondering if everyone thinks this might be hypoglycemia, if this means i have diabetes or not necessarily, or might be something else entirely? within the past month i have had frequent awful headaches, within the past year i have developed severely dry skin, especially on my feet. is an endocrinologist the best person to consult in this situation? (i was blood tested when i was diagnosed with PCOS and had moderately low levels of HDL.) thanks for your help.",
