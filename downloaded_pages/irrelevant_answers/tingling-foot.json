            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Paresthesias or abnormal sensations which can include tingling can be due to diabetes, thyroid disorders, Lyme's or lupus should also be ruled out.It can also be due to electrolyte imbalance, a pinched nerve other than sciatica\u2014hence nerve conduction studies should be done.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you for the response. When i saw the doc, he said i had really tight hamstrings and that was one of the big muscles which really tightened up one night and was screaming in pain (I initially thought this thing was a nerve but, apparently not). He told me to keep stretching the muscle constantly. Can you offer any stretches which might help? I'm defintely not diabetic or pre-diabetic at that, we had a blood test taken which confirmed all my sugar levels are fine. I'm a healthy 120lb 5' 8'' and no history of thyroid disease or anything runs in the family.I've done some stretches which seem to help, it just seems weird that tight hamstrings would cause something like a tingling foot? I guess everything is connected.",

    "question": "I am open to suggestions and ideas on what this could be. For the past 2 months, I've been dealing with some tingling in my right foot and discomfort when sitting down. (I initially thought i was sitting on my testicles or something).The doctor informed me it wasn't sciatica which i thought it was originally and the big muscle that was causing me problems sitting down apparently is the upper hamstring being really tight? I've done some stretching and now I can sit comfortably, however, time to time the tingling in the right foot comes back. I really won't notice unless I wiggle my toes or tap the bottom of my foot.Any suggestions of specific stretches to help cure this? I am on the right track?",
