    "question": "To start off, Im 14 years old, almost 15, yes, Im a hypochrondiac I decided to look here. About 2 months ago, I worried i had diabetes, I had tingling in my foot, muscle twitches and burning sensation, excess peeing and ect. Im a paranoid hypochrondiac with anxiety. After a month all the symptoms disappeared, the muscle twitching disappeared but came back. Now the muscle twitches arent really there during the day but eventually they came back and usually come back at night or at rest. Once i move the muscle thats twitching it goes away. But still it's irritating. I have no weakness, Although I keep looking at my hands because im scared of ALS. No family history, I know no one that has it even though im this young. It's winter break could it just be I have too much excess energy, I don't go out that often. I virtually NEVER twitch when walking or hanging out. But today this morning after waking up, the sides of my eyes kept twitching, I woke up after good sleep, but i was very paranoid last night because I thought alot, like extremely paranoid, did not move my muscles. I keep getting eye twitches, but once i move it it goes. and comes back. and just once it twitched so bad it looked like I was winking. My eyes seem tired, I have been doing\u00a0\u00a0a bit of homework. I go on the computer alot. Help anyone ? I dont want any neurological diseases interfering with my schoolwork. Especially something you can't cure. My balance is perfect though.",
