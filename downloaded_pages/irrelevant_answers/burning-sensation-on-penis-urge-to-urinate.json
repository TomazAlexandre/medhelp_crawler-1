            "answer": "Hello,The urge of frequent urination can be due to diabetes mellitus. Other possibilities are glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis(inflammation of the kidneys),urinary tract infection, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia(low potassium),hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism or diuretic drugs.In my opinion, investigations like kidney functions, blood sugar levels, ultrasound lower abdomen ,intravenous pyelography , pregnancy blood test, thyroid function tests and cystoscopy may be needed to confirm a diagnosis. I sincerely advise you to consult a urologist or nephrologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made and causes like kidney causes which can cause abdominal pain also ruled out. But firstly try drinking plenty of water because if it is simple UTI, then adequate amount of fluids will flush out the infection.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "hi,for the last week I had this urge to urinate even after i had just urinated.\u00a0\u00a0However there isn't any pain while I am urinating.\u00a0\u00a0Also just 2 days ago I began to have this burning sensation in my penis after I urinate, it isn't too painful but annoying.\u00a0\u00a0Could this all point to a UTI? or STD?\u00a0\u00a0I highly doubt it is an STD because when I urinate there is no pain or blood.I also started to have dark greenish/black stool (feces) and sometimes my lower abdomen and lower back begin to throb but there isn't too much pain and it happens randomlyFor some reason reason I feel like these two problems (burning sensation on penis and black stool) are connected to each other.I plan on seeing a doctor tomorrow but anybody have an idea what it may be so I can mention it?Thank you so much",
