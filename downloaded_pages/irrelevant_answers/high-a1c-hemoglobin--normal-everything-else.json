            "answer": "More information from you is needed to answer your question properly.\"I just had blood work done and it showed an A1C level of 8.1.\"When interpreting your hemoglobin test you should keep in mind that results differ depending on the test method used. HbA1c test results are expressed as a percentage, with 4 to 6 % considered normal. I came across this chart http://tinyurl.com/6nj9n that you may find interesting. In any event it's hard to say where you stand without knowing your labs A1C range. Have you not discussed the lab results with your PCP?\"Everything else was completley normal-cholesteral, glucose, lipids.\"This lab, glucose, was taken at the same time as your A1C? If your A1C @ 8.1% is considered high there is no way you could have a \"normal\" glucose reading.",
