            "answer": "I am very hesitant to recommend contacting the State Bureau of Motor vehicles, but in this case am making an exception.Physicians are constrained in revealing information to outside authorities.You have a moral obligation to have his driving priviliges revoked, if indeed, the information you allege is factual. A person who \"blacks out\" six times has no business behind the wheel of a motor vehicle.Be the bad guy and make an official report to (a) The Department of Motor Vehicles and (b) the State Police.This does not mean he won't be banned from driving forever. After a year of no blackouts, and a physician's letter, driving priviliges can be reinstated.It appears he is being properly and competently evaluated, taking into acount the constellation of symptoms. Sometimes these problems are hard to pin down.",

            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!There are many causes of weight loss like worms in stool, depression, anorexia nervosa, AIDS, cancers especially colon cancers, drug abuse, infections and loss of appetite. Loss of appetite can again be due to certain medications, drug abuse, depression, AIDS, acute and chronic infections, cancers and hypothyroidism. Either your brother does not eat well or there is increased metabolism as in hyperthyroid states, HIV, cancer etc. Poor absorption as in irritable bowel syndromes and malabsorption syndromes too is possible. Malabsorptin syndromes are seen in intestinal tuberculosis, HIV, tropical sprue, parasites in stool and Whipple\u2019s Disease. I have enumerated the possibilities that come to my mind right now. MAYBE YOU CAN SEEK A SECOND OPINION. Poor eating can result in low blood sugar and fainting attacks. I have a feeling your bother started the weight loss program on his own, without any medical guidance, resulting in adverse effects on the body.Serious long term complications of black widows spider are rare especially after 6-7 months of the bite.Hope this helps. Do discuss this with your doctor and get your brother examined accordingly. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "The \"proper direction\" for the \"license thing\" is for you to report this to the Department of Motor Vehicles and the State Police. It's very hard to do something like this when you are a relative, but having your brother dead or a quadraplegic after he slams into a tree after a blackout won't be a very pleasant thing to live with.You are undoubtedly a caring nice person, and I don't want to come off as a monster or the \"internet police\", but there is a high probability someone will be in an accident and suffer horrendous consequences because someone failed to act.Diabetes is one possibility, however I simply do not believe your story that \"the doctors won't act\". It's not reality. But it could be true. I don't know what your brother told the physicians in the privacy of the examination room.\u00a0\u00a0You may not have a health care proxy and they may simply do not wish to discuss details of his evaluation with you. As critical as I am of physicians, I suspect they have indeed ruled out disbetes.Needles to say he need either a fasting glucose test of an insulin clamp. On the surface, my gut feeling is that the situation may be due to abnormally high or low blood sugar levels.Certainly diabetic coma is one reasonable\u00a0\u00a0possibility to acount for the \"blackouts\".Dr.nee was providing good advice in suggesting you get a \"second opinion\", however I suspect your brother wants to maintain complete control over his medical evaluations. I also suspect there is a big \"missing piece\" to this story.For a diabetic \"poor eating\", as Dr.nee pointed out, could cause a \"blackout\", Diabetic blackouts are generally slower in onset, and not \"sudden\".Request your brother to sign a release to you for his medical records and sign a medical proxy for you to interface with his physicians. Without these documents they probably won't talk to you.Then, determine if in fact he has had a diabetic screen, and if not, why not?Good luck with this.",

            "answer": "One if he had a work up at the hospital from the accident (and I imagine he did I couldn't imagine otherwise) they would have pulled a CBC and glucose level there.\u00a0\u00a0So even if the docs won't do anything it surely would have been done at the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0That being said you don't have to wait on a doc to get tested for diabetes - there are online labs tests you can order yourself for it (just take it to any lab) - you can also just buy a glucose meter and test it yourself with that (no prescription required) - or have your friend test it if they have a meter.\u00a0\u00a0But diabetes is usually quickly ruled in or out (generally).\u00a0\u00a0And as one person pointed out the docs can't tell you legally what's been done/not done.Don't know about the spider bite - but generally not the symptoms you describe six months later.Other quick tests he could consider is for lyme disease or west nile virus (if you live where there are tics and/or mosquitos (not sure if all the symptoms fit there but there are always exceptions - I know a friend that had both at same time and he's had a terrible time).Frankly there are many things that can cause these type symptoms (many mentioned earlier posts) including behaviors that he has (not eating anorexia/bulemia, drugs, etc.) - and for those it's doubtful the person would admit it (sometimes not even to themselves - living in denial).\u00a0\u00a0I would personally get a second opinion from a doctor in an unrelated medical group.",

            "answer": "Perhaps the reason they aren't testing him for diabetes is because his glucose levels were already checked with a metabolic panel (similar to what webcrystal suggested)...can you type up some of his bloodwork? What is his latest WBC count? How about his RBC count? Was a metabolic panel actually performed? Has anyone in your family experienced anything similar?I'd look into adrenal fatigue--fainting brought on by low blood pressure or orthostatic hypotension that results from him standing up or even standing too long, as well as narcolepsy, which is a bit of a stretch. As for the black widow bite--this can cause fainting, but usually it occurs at some point immediately following the bite, not several months later. Was he certain it was a black widow (i.e. did someone observe the spider biting him, running away, or kill it? Was it only your brother?)? It sounds like some of the spider's neurotoxins may have remained in your brother's system, though I can't say I know much about this. He might want to see a specialist to look into this, as a heavy course of antibiotics could help him out, if this is the case. Otherwise, given how long it's been since the bite, any effects are likely to be permanent at this point. What is your brother's job, if you don't mind me asking? Does he have to stand a lot for it?In any event, I wish you, your brother, and your family the best of luck in figuring out what's going on with him. Just don't give up and keep getting additional opinions until you find the answer. I wouldn't recommend having any drastic medical procedures done just yet, like getting a pacemaker...unless cardiologists can isolate an irregular heart rhythm. Has your brother done a 24-hr EKG? Perhaps this will help them better understand what's happening to him while he's at work and he faints.",

    "question": "My brother is 18 years old and up until about 6 months ago was in pretty good health.\u00a0\u00a0We suddenly started to notice some extreme changes in him such as extreme weight loss, losing around 50 or more pounds in about a three months time period.\u00a0\u00a0He had started running everyday and eating better so at first we contributed it to that.\u00a0\u00a0(But to look at him I was worried about an eating disorder or something).\u00a0\u00a0then one day we get the call that he had been in a car accident.\u00a0\u00a0he was very out of it and disoriented and didn't know how the accident had happened.\u00a0\u00a0he was rushed to the er and the doctors performed many tests.\u00a0\u00a0there were no drugs found in his system, only ephedrine was apparently he had been taking some diet pills.\u00a0\u00a0so at first we thought ok, he was pushing himself way too hard.\u00a0\u00a0a few weeks later we got another call from his job.\u00a0\u00a0an ambulance had been called because a customer had found him unconscious on the floor.\u00a0\u00a0this time no ephedrine found in his system.\u00a0\u00a0since then he has \"blacked out\"\u00a0\u00a0a total of 6 times.\u00a0\u00a0one of those time included another car accident, totalling a second vehicle of his just a week ago.\u00a0\u00a0This morning made for the 6th time when he was found at work again unconconsious.\u00a0\u00a0 the doctors have no idea why this is happening.\u00a0\u00a0we have suggested they test him for diabetes, hypoglocemia, etc.... they will not do it.\u00a0\u00a0I am unsure why and my parents are very upset.\u00a0\u00a0Also, he was bitten by a black widow spider about 6-7 months ago and we've been told this can cause long term neurological damage in rare cases.\u00a0\u00a0i can't find anything online about this.\u00a0\u00a0the doctors have talked about everything from nuerological disorders, cardiac problems to even putting in a pace maker.\u00a0\u00a0(HE'S 18!!!!!)\u00a0\u00a0He's gone through some stressful situations over the last year but nothing i don't think he could really handle.\u00a0\u00a0(who hasn't right?)\u00a0\u00a0I'm terrified that one day we will get the call that he is dead because he wasn't diagnosed in time and he wasn't treated or that he was in a fatal car accident because he won't stay out of a car and the doctor's won't take his driving priveledges.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have any suggestion or theories?\u00a0\u00a0Could it possibly be from the Widow's bite not being treated properly (btw, he was not given antivenin)?\u00a0\u00a0Someone Please Help......",
