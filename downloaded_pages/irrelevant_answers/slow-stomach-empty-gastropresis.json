            "answer": "That's a pretty open question. Chinese medicine practitioners claim that they have a fair amount of success with curing some types of gastroparesis, but a lot of it has to do with the reason for the condition. Is there an underlying condition in your case? (Diabetes is the most common, but there are others.) I have heard of a few successful cases of naturopaths working with the condition to improve it. My own condition was improved somewhat while seeing an acupuncturist, although due to my moving out of town my sessions had to stop.As far as western medicine is concerned, there's not really much that can be done. Medications like Reglan and Domperidone might be of use. (If you're already taking Reglan and you're having side effects, ask about Domperidone.) The herb shatavari has been known to help, as has Iberogast, I don't know how effective they would be considering the severity of your condition.",

I was in a car accident and have 4 herniated discs. also I have gal bladder removed in 2001. Orther than that I don't have any serious problem. I do believe in Ayurvedic medicine. I'll try to get Shatavari. and see if it will make any difference. Domperidone, is it available through Pharmacy (Prescription)? My food intake is very low becaue of this reason, anytime I eat even small portion I get bloated and takes hours to digest food. When I wake up in the morning my stomach if flat. Due to this. I have gain 30 lbs in two years. Please advice.",

            "answer": "First, regarding alternative medicine, make sure you're working with a practitioner. Also, shatavari should not be taken with domperidone. Unless told otherwise, between the two, I would recommend the domperidone.Idiopathic gastroparesis (what I was diagnosed with) can be a pain in the rump at times, particularly because you DON'T know why it's happening. @donnaraeb makes some great points, since that type of diet can help a lot, but each person with GP is very different, so you'll have to experiment a lot on your own. Some do better with all veggies, others can't do a thing with fiber. Low-fat is certainly the way to go, though, as fat actually causes the body to release hormones which paralyze the stomach in order to allow the digestion of the fat. Good fats (non-saturated) have worked out well for me, but that's not an indication of how it would work with you. A \"safe\" diet is low fiber/low fat, but that can get very annoying very quickly. It should also be heavily supplemented.Good luck with this. There's a great Yahoo group on Gastroparesis (just do a search for them in Yahoo Groups) which you may want to join.",

            "answer": "If carbs make you sick, consider the possibility that you may have a gluten intolerance. This has been tied to delayed gastric emptying. Up to 1 in 7 people have some level of gluten intolerance, and up to 1 in 250 are celiac (higher probability if you're of European or American ancestry, lower if you're of Asian or African ancestry). Consider getting a gluten intolerance test from EnteroLab.Cheese and meats are probably NOT all that good for you at this time due to their fat content. However, if you find this setup works for you then continue with it. Experiment with your diet some and--I cannot stress this enough--keep a food/symptom journal to see how you react to different combinations. Weekly reviews should help you spot patterns fairly quickly. Cooked fruits and vegetables may be your best bets for a healthy diet at this point.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Regarding domperidone: It's standard procedure in just about every country (other than the US) for gastroparesis. The drug has been proven safe, and has less side effects than just about any other drug available for the condition.You can search for pharmacies which carry this and do price comparisons at PharmacyChecker.com (recommended by the AARP). I get mine from BlueSkyDrugs (blueskydrugs.com), although I've started using Iberogast in lieu of domperidone, since my gastroparesis is borderline and could just as easily be dyspepsia. (Maybe both can be used? Considering they both work with fundal distension, I'm not quite sure how well they would work together. )Note that for overseas and Canadian pharmacies accessed through PharmacyChecker, you WILL need a prescription for the domperidone, which will need to be faxed (by you or your doctor) to the pharmacy. Usually you go to the pharmacy's site, order the drug, they send you an email form and you fax that form along with your prescription. This is when the purchase finally goes through.",
