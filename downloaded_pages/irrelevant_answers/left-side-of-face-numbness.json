            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Common cold, sinusitis, ear infection, sensory nerve compression, peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes can all cause ear numbness that spreads to face. Hemi-facial numbness is also seen in Bell\u2019s palsy, trigeminal neuralgia where a spasm may cause numbness, or due to acoustic neuroma which is a benign tumor of the eighth cranial nerve.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please discuss these possibilities with an ENT doctor. I understand that you do not have medical insurance, but this is a problem that cannot be resolved by self care. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "I have numbness on my left side the numbness extends into my mouth and top of my head. I do not have medical insurance either but I went to the ER. I have MS so I thought it may be a complication of that, the ER doctor was not sure of my diagnosis, they did many tests including CT Scan, MRI, and blood and urine tests. They mentioned Complex Migraines could be the problem. I have made an appointment with my Neurologist. Did you find out what caused your numbness, because I still don't have an answer to mine. Thanks!",
