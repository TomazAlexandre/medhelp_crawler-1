            "answer": "Ultrasounds can be off by 1-3lbs. So you could give birth in a couple weeks to a 7lb baby lol. That being said, having GD it is more likely that you'll have a bigger baby. My DD was 8lb9oz at 41 weeks and we had a vaginal birth with few issues. My friend just had a 10lb3oz baby at 42+3 at home and all natural. We were made for this. Don't stress too much mama!",

            "answer": "Ultrasounds are known to be off when calculating baby weight. My first was 6.15 and by my second they said he would be 7lbs well he was 8.10 and all natural vaginal birth. Don't worry nature will take its course and you will have a healthy baby. Good luck and congrats.",

            "answer": "My first was 9lbs3oz.\u00a0\u00a0No prob. My OB told me by week 38 of my second pregnancy\u00a0\u00a0that my baby was \"already as big as her brother, and would be close to 11lbs if I did not get induced early\"\u00a0\u00a0So I gave up my dream of a natural birth....and delivered a 7 pound daughter! I was pretty upset I allowed the inacurate ob estimate scare me. My third child was delivered natural with a midwife and was 9lbs 9oz...most perfect delivery of them all. Good luck!",
