            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about what all you have had to face in life! I hope things improve from now on. Yes, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome can cause fatigue and maybe decreased libido due to vaginal dryness. However, since you have had so many surgical procedures, you must get your iron and hemoglobin levels checked. Also, since you have auto-immune disorders possibility of diabetes too should be looked into.Since you have hysteron-salpingo-oopherectomy, there is a possibility that you have low estrogen. This can also cause decreased libido and fatigue. Please discuss this possibility with your gynecologist. Hormone replacement therapy will do wonders if this is the cause.Take care!",

            "answer": "Hi,I am brand new to the medhelp world, and I just read this post of yours. I can relate to you so much! All of the back issues and surgery and chronic pain. I also have tremendous joint pain throughout my body, and neuropathy, and I could go on and on. I also have Chronic Major Depression that cycles with with the chronic pain which often affects my self esteem. Does that ever happen to you? And the low libido? What libido?? And yes, the fatigue!!! I get you so much! It is inexplicable. You wake up feeling as if you haven't just slept at all. Everything tires you out. There is never any energy. I am on a boatload of meds, but nothing helps the fatigue. The only thing that ever helped was Vit D. My levels were incredibly low, which I was told was common in Autoimmunes. Sunshine is the best way I get my Vit D, which helps boost your Serotonin levels, which helps the depression. That's been my best remedy for over 20 years. I would love to know how you beat the pain with such little medicine. I cannot walk, sit, concentrate, or hold a conversation without the pain screaming at me.",
