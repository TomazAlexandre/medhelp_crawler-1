            "answer": "My last ultrasound was at 34 weeks ... I think they usually do one around that time to see how the baby is growing ... I got chked for diabetes 3 different times with this pregnancy and I don't have it so that can't be what's causing the baby to be big ... My first sin was 7.12 born at 38 weeks and my daughter was 7.5 born at 37 weeks ... I thinking they would have been pretty close to 9 if I would have went to my due date ... Hopefully this little man decides to come a little early too before he gets too big ... Lol ... For what I've been reading and you ladies comments seems like the estimates for weight at this time aren't very good :)",
