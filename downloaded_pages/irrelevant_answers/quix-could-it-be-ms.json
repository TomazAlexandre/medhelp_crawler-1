            "answer": "Hi!!\u00a0\u00a0Haven't you and I talked before, maybe last spring over on the Gneral Neuro Board?\u00a0\u00a0I remember your \"name.\"\u00a0\u00a0Nothing that you talked about in you post sounded much like MS to me.\u00a0\u00a0Don't worry about being flabby - that's a big me, too.\u00a0\u00a06 + years of sitting in a recliner and eating from depression have put the pounds on me, too.\u00a0\u00a0With the osteoarthritis, Tyoe II diabetes and Fibromyalgia all of the things you mention are pretty well accounted for.I don't really understand why the muscles in your legs are hard, though, unless they have increased tone, as in spasticity.\u00a0\u00a0That's a question your doctors should look at and address.\u00a0\u00a0They should check your reflexes while they're atIf the PCP thought a going over by a rheumatologist was a good idea, then I do too.\u00a0\u00a0During a visit, so much information gets processed by the doctor that sometimes at the end I used to forget some of the things I had mentioned wanting to do.\u00a0\u00a0My patients knew that and would remind me.\u00a0\u00a0As you should, too. Call your PCP's office and just leave the message that she had wanted a Rheumatology referral, but forgot to do it.\u00a0\u00a0That's one of the things we need to do to advocate for ourselves.Long?????\u00a0\u00a0Have you seen some of my posts?\u00a0\u00a0We don't call them \"epic discourses\" for nothing.\u00a0\u00a0These boards are for communicating.\u00a0\u00a0Take as many words as you need, and a few more, while they're free!I want you to read what you wrote in your post above and make sure you listed everything (everything) you wanted to ask about, especially all the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0You really didn't list many of the things that make you feel crummy.\u00a0\u00a0But, what you did write does not sound like MS.Hope I hear back, Quix",

            "answer": "Yes, we have talked on the neuro forum. I am healing from my cervical fusion, still have some muscle pain, but am back to work driving 8 hrs a day, and dr says I'm holding head and neck in different position and straining my neck muscles. Don't have any choice, since I have to work. At one time I wa diagnosed with myofascial spasm syndrom, and had very painful physical therapy to break up the knots formed on my muscles. Helped at the time, but I'm sure they are reformed by now. I know I am depressed, but I hurt all the time. My shoulders hurt, my left elbow hurts off & on. My mid-back area hurts, and lower back across to the hips. When I lay on either side, my hips hurt where the pressure is against them. When I first get up in the morning I can't hardly walk up or down my stairs, but that gets better as the day goes by. My PCP put me on Lyrica 2 months ago, which seems to be helping some.Sometimes I have trouble writing things, then that doesn't happen for a long time. Lots of headaches and blurry vision, that's why I was concerned about MS. I see my dr on Sept 4th and will remind him about the referral. Thank you so much for your reassurances. Most of my pain is probably from a combination of the osteoarthritis, bulging disc, and fibro, but somany symptoms mimic other diseases, just wanted a little re-assurance, which you are so great to probide. Hope you are felling well, now that it is starting to cool down a little. Again, thank you",

            "answer": "Oh, I also forgot to mention that sometimes I itch like crazy. It feels like something is crawlying around under my skin. I will itch until I leave sores on my arms and legs. Cortizone creams don't seem to help much. I go to a naturopathic PCP. Should I be seeing someone else? (In your wonderous & great opinion?) LOL Pet the Queen Mother for me. Is your new kitten a Bengal?",

            "answer": "I think Clyde is a bengal, shorthair mix.\u00a0\u00a0She was a rescue kitty having been abandoned with her mom and litter mates shortly after birth.\u00a0\u00a0All of her markings are like a marble bengal, swirls and circle on her sides, three stripes down the back, riotous polka-dotted tummy and a looooong, three riged tail.\u00a0\u00a0Pure energy and love.\u00a0\u00a0The Queen Mother is not pleased, but she is number one and always gets the lap.The itching could be another paresthesia.\u00a0\u00a0I'd have to check it it is a hyper or hypo symptom.\u00a0\u00a0Why don't you give 600mg of alpha lipoic acid a day a trial. Check it out with your PCP.\u00a0\u00a0It's used across Europe for neuropathic pain.\u00a0\u00a0Can't hurt, but check with your doctor.Quix",

    "question": "I hope you are feeling okay. I hope you can answer my questions. I am a 60yr old, overweight, female. I have degenerative osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and type 2 diabetes. I recently had a C5-6 cervical fusion. I have bulging discs at T-8, and at L4-5. On my MRI at T-8 it also says I have superior endplate depression. I looked this up, and it says that is indicitave of auto-immune diseases. But it didn't list which ones. My eyes get blurry, and sometimes I seem in a \"fog\", which I attributed to the fibro. The muscles in my legs clear to my thights are very hard, and they hurt for hours after a walk for a distance.The rest of me is kinda flabby. I have pain in ribcage, back. Basically all over my body. My PCP talked about sending me to a rheumatologist to see about other auto-immune disease possibility, but then got side-tracked, and didn't make the referral. Do I need to be concerned about MS? Does it cause these symptoms. Sorry this is so long, but wanted to include as much info as I could. I would appreciate your help. Thank you for any answers.",
