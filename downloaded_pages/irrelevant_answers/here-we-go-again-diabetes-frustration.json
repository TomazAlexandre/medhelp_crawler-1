            "answer": "Hello,I am a volunteer living with Type I diabetes and unfortunately I don't have much information or experience dealing with MODY.I'm sorry you've been going through this frustrating ordeal of watching your loved ones deal with this condition. I know it's difficult but please hang in there. Whichever type of diabetes your daughter and husband have I'm sure they'll be able to lead fairly normal lives with the help of medical professionals. It definitely takes time getting used to but with some effort and good guidance you really can live a happy and normal life with diabetes. I don't even realize sometimes that I have it. Everything comes naturally and automatically at this point.Since I don't have personal experience with MODY I can only offer you a few links to websites that may give you more information. I have posted these on this forum before:www.cureresearch.com/m/mody_diabetes/intro.htmhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturity_onset_diabetes_of_the_younghttp://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/reprint/23/3/381.pdfPerhaps others on this forum may give you more insight. Don't give up, stay positive and know that things will be just fine, even if it may seem hard in the beginning.Good luck and take care!",

    "question": "Ok! I have posted several times and have gotten some great words of encouragment and some awesome advice. My 5 year old was reciently diagnosed with diabetes, and yesterday I recieved a phone call from our family doctor that my 34 year old husband is also diabetic (Type 2). When I hung up the phone I cried and cried because I feel as though everything is just falling apart. My 5 year old has been picked and poked at over the last month, and the doctor still has not figured out what type of diabetes she has. Last time I spoke to the doctor, he really was leaning towards a genetic disorder called MODY (Maturity onset of Diabetes in the Young). Everything I am reading tells me that this is the easiest type of diabetes to control. Could it be possible that this is what my husband has too? Does anyone have any information on this type of diabetes?",
