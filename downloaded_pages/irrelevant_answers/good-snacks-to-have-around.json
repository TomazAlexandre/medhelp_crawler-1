            "answer": "Hi Cousin T!\u00a0\u00a0How nice of you to be concerned about serving something that will meet your cousin's dietary needs.\u00a0\u00a0The important thing to remember is that all of us need to refrain from processed foods & too much sugar.\u00a0\u00a0A well balanced, healthy meal is all that is really called for (whether it's lunch or dinner that you're serving).\u00a0\u00a0A starch (whole grain breads, or baked french fries or mashed potatoes or sweet potatoes), veggie (cooked or raw), and a lean meat (chicken or lean beef) or fish make a great menu.\u00a0\u00a0You can't miss by serving an angel food cake with fresh fruit for dessert.\u00a0\u00a0I made an angel food cake for easter by taking a can of light cherries (the kind you put on cheesecake)and mixing it with the dry angel food cake mix.\u00a0\u00a0Pour into a Pam sprayed 9x13 and cook for 38-48 minutes @ 350 degrees.\u00a0\u00a0It was great served with lite cool whip too!I can relate to your cousin's mom being very careful as to what is eaten and also about being neurotic too as my daughter was diagnosed at 21 months.\u00a0\u00a0Especially with a 13 year old, it is very very difficult to regulate those blood sugars with hormones and all the other physical changes that kids go through.\u00a0\u00a0Please let her know that we're here if she has any questions and there's also a great website through the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation at www.jdrf.org if she wants to check them out also.Good luck with your company!",

            "answer": "Parents of munchkins with diabetes also appreciate ingredients lists and recipe cards with the menu on it.\u00a0\u00a0Many folks do \"carbohydrate counting\" and can estimate how many carbos are in any given meal based on the ingredients & serving sizes.\u00a0\u00a0YOu don't need to compute all that, but just showing mom or dad the ingredients can go a long way to lessening everyone's concerns.\u00a0\u00a0AND, the child can then really enjoy a piece of whatever is served.It's so thoughtful of you to ask ... I hope your event went deliciously well!",

    "question": "Hi All,Having company tomorrow, cousin has JD, 13 yrs.old, sugars are all over the map.\u00a0\u00a0Her mother, my aunt, is completely neurotic about every bite that goes in her mouth-- literally measures each meal/snack with a nurse's precision ( such as breaking a cookie in half or even quarters), even takes into consideration what she didn't finish on her plate.\u00a0\u00a0 Anyway, I can't have company without serving something, what would be a good idea to have on the table.Thank you in advance for your help, I see there are many more serious problems than my curious little question.\u00a0\u00a0Good health to you all, T",
