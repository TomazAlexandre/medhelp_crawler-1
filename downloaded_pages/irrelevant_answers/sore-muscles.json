            "answer": "Hi there!Sore muscles can be causes by muscular stress/ overwork, inflammations, muscular degenerations, systemic infections, a few autoimmune conditions, hormonal/ endocrine abnormalities, micronutrient deficiencies etc. Without an evaluation and probably a few tests, it would be difficult to point out a single cause. It is best advised to consult your primary care physician for an evaluation for the above mentioned conditions. After a cause is diagnosed, it can be managed accordingly.Hope this helps.Take care!",
