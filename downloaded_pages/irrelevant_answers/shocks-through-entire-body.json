            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Electric current like feeling can be due to side effects of certain medications. So stop this drug if you are taking one and see if it helps. It can also be due to fibromyalgia, Vit D or Vit B12 deficiency or peripheral neuropathy of diabetes and hypothyroidism. A pinched nerve can also be the cause. Lyme\u2019s disease is another possibility.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

    "question": "I have noticed that some days when I wake up in the morning and try to fall back asleep I get a weird sensation that bothers me. It feels like a light shock going through my body every few seconds and I can't figure out what it could be. It gets so strong sometimes that I get paranoid and think it's my laptop laying on my bed thats electricity is getting to me (silly, I know). I can't fall back asleep when I start to feel it and it's extremely bothersome. Any idea what this is? By the way, I am 17 and weigh 105 lbs and have mild MVP.",
