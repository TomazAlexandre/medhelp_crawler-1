            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for posting.Steroid injections raise the blood sugar level. Blood sugar levels should be monitored very closely when one receives cortisone shots.Are you still on steroids? If yes that can explain the high blood sugar levels.Sphenoid mucus retention cyst will not affect the blood sugar levels. I would suggest you to discuss this issue with your treating doctor as you may need medications to control blood sugar levels.Lets us know if you have more questions. Take care!",

            "answer": "No Steroids since then. And yes I am taking Januvia but when I start to have infection,sinuses infection my blood sugar goes up and down which I am aware that infections and antibotics make it do that. My concern is where this cyst is located in the sphenoid sinuses due to the fact of the pituitary gland is also located there I do not know where the cyst is ie.anterior or posterior but what i am getting at is that does effect some of the hormones in the body and last time I check this does effect blood sugars, thyroid and the list goes on.On the ct scan it just states in sphenoid which I know not everybodys or every sphenoid is the same size or shape. But could it be possiable that it is putting pressure on the pituitary? Making waves with my metabolism, and or the decreasing of my body making insulin? Thanks for your comment.",

            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing back.For a person with diabetes it is very common to have high blood glucose levels during infection whether it is bacterial or viral. Blood sugar levels have been found to be dangerously high in diabetics suffering from infection. It is very important that a person with diabetes drinks plenty of water when there is infection.Sphenoid sinus retention cyst can put pressure on the pituitary gland but the hormone insulin which controls the blood sugar levels is released from pancreas which is located on the left side of the abdominal cavity.Hope this answers your question.",
