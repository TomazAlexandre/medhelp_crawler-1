    "question": "I am scheduled for my Glucose screen in a few weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I have been looking this up online because, as this is my third pregnancy, the instructions from this doctor don't seem to be what I recall in the past.\u00a0\u00a0They are saying it is okay to eat my \"normal meals\" on the day of the test, but to avoid sugary foods and drinks.\u00a0\u00a0In my past two pregnancies I seem to recall having to fast before this test, which was confirmed by my findings online: \" For eight to 14 hours before the test, you can't eat or drink anything but sips of water...\"\u00a0\u00a0Also, I will point out that they are calling this test an RGS (Random Glucose Screen) and not a Glucose Tolerance Test, just in case that makes a difference.Anyone else here that has taken this test been able to eat normally beforehand?\u00a0\u00a0Were the results affected by this?\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned if I do eat that will throw the results off, and I am concerned if I DON'T eat that will throw it off lol (catch 22 :o)\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure the doctor's office wouldn't say I could eat if it was going to interfere with the results, but stranger things have happened, and this doctor's office doesn't always seem to have it together (e.g. they refer me out to a doctor two hours away for things I think they *should* be able to do here, they tried to draw blood twice for the same thing [sequential screen I had already done and *I* had to point that out, they missed it!] etc.)\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
