            "answer": "Hi there,The most common cause of mildly elevated liver enzymes is fatty liver. The common cause of fatty liver is alcohol abuse, diabetes mellitus and obesity. Hepatitis A infection in childhood does not cause persistently elevated SGPT.Chronic hepatitis C infection can cause high SGPT.You may repeat the test after a month or so and check. If it remains high a hepatitis profile may be done. Any test result should be correlated clinically. Keep me posted.Best luck and regards!",
