    "question": "It started with a foot injury a month ago, I got a stress fracture from running and possible nerve damage, so I was put into a boot for 2 weeks then I got it off at the beginning of may, it seemed to be doing better then last week numbness/tingliness went up my leg and part of my left, and its kinda like its asleep, I can feel sharp, smooth,, cold, hot etc. But then this weeekend it moved all the way to my head, but when it was at my head it wasn't as strong as it was in my legs, it seems it just keeps moving from legs to neck area around head, then once its done it'll repeat, and it leaves my uscles sore and right now my right wrist hurts, and usually my fingers hurt but not today, and its not vitamin b12 deficiency cuz they did a blood test at the doc last week, I got signed up for a neurologist june 7th, but that's so far away, what do you think it is?? I'm so paranoid that I think its MS, diabetes, and other rare or serious casesThe numbness isn't that strong most of the time but its strong enough to know that theirs something wrong and strong enough to not make me run on the treadmil, its worse in my legs it seems, sometimes when I'm at school ill be wresting my arm on the table with some of my weight on it and I have to stop cuz it hurts",
