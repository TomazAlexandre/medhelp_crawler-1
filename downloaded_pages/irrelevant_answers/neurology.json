            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. What prolapsed you have?\u00a0\u00a0Rectal or disc prolapse?Anyways, yes, you should consult a neurologist. The symptoms could be due to drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, poor sleep patterns, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, hyper and hypothyroidism, lupus, and Lyme\u2019s. Multiple sclerosis, Parkinsonism, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. and certain epilepsies too could be the cause.If all these are ruled out, then yes, your symptoms can be thought to be due to anxiety. Since you have gastro problems, H pylori infection should be looked into. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for your reply. I feel so lost because my symptoms are so peculiar. The prolapses are rectal and vaginal. I will try and encourage my doctor to refer me to a neurologist. Could some of this be a side effect of Clonazapam. I'm taking 500 micrograms at night?",

    "question": "I would really like some help with some weird symptoms. About 2 weeks ago I started getting tingling in my legs and arms and on my face. It has become quite bad and hurts a lot, particulalry at night. I also have myoclonic jerks. My doctor has prescribed clonazepam which helps a bit. I have managed to get away with taking 500 micrograms at night but I feel I am begining to get tolerant. I am reluctant to increase it, although I have been told I can take more. Since I have had other problems (prolapse and gastro symptoms) my doctor is putting it all down to anxiety. I have no obvious neurological symptoms on screening so says I don't need to see a neurologist. i feel a bit lost in the system. I am anxious but surely I should see a neurologist. This is not following the pattern of my normal anxiety?",
