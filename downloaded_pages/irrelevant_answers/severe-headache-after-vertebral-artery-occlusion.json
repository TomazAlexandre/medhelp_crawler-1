            "answer": "Thank you for the response Dr. Sharma.\u00a0\u00a0He did experience a tia within 24 hours of surgery that was recognized by the MRI when he went back to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0The only symptoms he's experiencing right now are headache, neck pain and continued weakness in the affected arm.\u00a0\u00a0The surgeon relayed that these symptoms are normal after surgery and that it is highly unlikely that he would suffer another tia or stroke due to the occlusion.\u00a0\u00a0As far as I know, he doesn't have any of the risk factors you listed above.\u00a0\u00a0He is very conscientious regarding his health and he works out regularly at the gym lifting weights and doing cardiovascular excercise. In your opinion, what is the normal recovery time for endoscopic surgery of the cervical spine and would the artery occlusion delay his recovery time?\u00a0\u00a0I look forward to your reply.",

    "question": "A friend of mine just had an endoscopic cervical discectomy and as a result suffered a vertebral artery occlusion.\u00a0\u00a0Less than 24 hours after being released from the hospital he experienced dizziness, weakness in his right side and numbness in his face.\u00a0\u00a0He returned to the ER where they admitted him and performed an MRI that showed the occlusion.\u00a0\u00a0Basically, he had a mini stroke or tia but Dr's said no damage to the cerebellum.\u00a0\u00a0He was released and ordered to take aspirin.\u00a0\u00a0He was told that the right vertebral artery would take over and that he could live a normal life with just the one artery.Since being released from the hospital, he is suffering with severe headaches.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone experienced this?\u00a0\u00a0If so, how long before they subside?\u00a0\u00a0Also, he is worried that he may still be at risk for a stroke? He is 45 years old and otherwise in great shape physically.This discussion is related to/posts/show/296355.",
