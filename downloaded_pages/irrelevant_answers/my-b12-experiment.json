            "answer": "i too am trying a for of B12. Im taking choline/instonol capsules every morning and have done for a couple of months now. The anxiety is getting better, but I still have the negative/doom thoughts but not as much. I also read over the weekend about Relora which Im thinking about giving a try as I've read good things about it. I posted asking if anyone had tried it to see if if really does work. Waiting to get some feedback before I try it but if not I might as well give it a go anyway! I really hope the B12 works for you, as I really know how horrible this is!!!!Good luck!!!",

    "question": "Over the past 5 years I have tried 7 different anxiety/deperssion meds...none of them have worked.\u00a0\u00a0THe side effects I experienced were so bad I had to stop taking them.\u00a0\u00a0This only made my anxiety/depression worse thinking I was hopeless with no help available but I never quit searching or fighting.3 weeks ago I happened across a few websites talking about vitamin deficiencies and listing sympotoms associated with the different vitamins.\u00a0\u00a0I was blown away at what I read.According to several websites I am symtomatic of a MAJOR B12 deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0TIngling hands and feet, weight loss, depression and gastro problems.\u00a0\u00a0I have all of those.\u00a0\u00a0I have been tested for just about any disease you can think of from Fibromyalgia, diabetes, chrons, and IBS.\u00a0\u00a0All results came back negative....I'm sure you can understand my frustration.Anyway...I've been taking B12 for 3 weeks and THINK I am seeing some minor results.\u00a0\u00a0I have noticed that I am having more moments of clarity with each passing day, I am beginning to sleep a little better and I don't FREAK OUT at every little thing.\u00a0\u00a0Don't get me wrong...I still have issues during the day but I'm certain the frequency and intensity is on the way down.\u00a0\u00a0Please remember that I am just a fellow suffer of anxiety and depression who is trying anything possible to get my life back and I'm wanting to share my experience with whoever will listen.",
