    "question": "i just recently like a couple weeks ago noticed that when i wipe there is blood around my anus, So when looking down there i noticed what looks like built up skin bumps around the anus hole. They are not painful but sometimes a little itchy, not alot tho. I am not sexually active so i dont think they could be a STD. I also just noticed them. Wondering if it could be a leakeage problem or irritation.",
